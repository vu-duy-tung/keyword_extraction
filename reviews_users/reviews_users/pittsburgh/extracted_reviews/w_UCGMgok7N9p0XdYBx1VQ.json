In which case you have no excuse for thinking this place is going to give you anything more than what it does -- warm meat and melty cheese with a handful of fries and another handful of vinegary cole slaw between two slices of soft fresh Italian bread. (Sit at the counter and you'll see that I'm not kidding about the handfuls.)  So if that's what you're in the mood for, this is your place. It's a Pittsburgh institution, and it's pretty yummy.

It was a sandwich mostly of slaw and fries.    The thick white bread was dry and boring; too crusty.   The fries on the sandwich overpowered the taste! So I dismantled it. When the rude server asked how I liked it, I was honest. He gave me big time attitude and commented that I took it apart. I told him, I took it apart because it was a horrible sandwich (the pastrami, by the way). And that, sir, is why you got a $0.35 tip! (never give a zero tip, they'll think you forgot, always leave just a small amount of change)  If you have to put all that hot sauce on the sandwich to make it palatable, why bother?  (The server, as he walked away, told me it's really good with hot sauce, which was just Tabasco, which I don't like, any way!)  They left off the tomato that supposedly comes with each sandwich!  Of the 4 staff members I came in contact with, all but 1 were rude, unfriendly and uncaring. One constantly walked by trash that had blown off outdoor tables without picking it up.  The fries were good.   Nope, won't be back.",

I ordered the pastrami served on two thick slices of bread, layered with french fries and cole slaw.  Granted, I like my carbs, but this was overload for me.  I wasn't particularly fond of the cole slaw either.    I think this is more of an acquired taste kind of place.  Not that I wouldn't go back, it's okay for an occasional visit.  There are other sandwiches to try.  But if you're used to the True pastrami with Swiss on rye, I wouldn't recommend the sandwich here.  The place itself is small and good for a group of four.  Eight if you don't mind sitting at two separate tables that are relatively close to each other.",

    "text": "We did the obligatory Primanti Bros stop on our recent first visit to Pittsburgh. We can understand how it's a novelty to have fries on everything. But if they're not seasoned well and crisp...what's the point? When a place gets talked up so much, you can't help but have big expectations. We were disappointed...  Here's the thing, when you sit down at a restaurant and the table is filthy, the menus have food all over them, and they bring your drinks in Solo cups...Without a doubt, if I were still in college and needed to nurse a hangover, this would probably be a go-to place.   My husband ordered the Italian Sausage, which was obscenely big, with good flavor, but again the fries were mush and flavorless. Luckily, we had ordered an additional side of slaw, because that's truly what made the sandwich, which was very tasty. We also ordered the \"vegetarian\" soup which was good, but I ordered a chix salad because a MASSIVE sandwich with fries and slaw on it was just not calling me. Little did I know, the gimmick of fries on everything meant fries on everything....including my salad. It was really gross to have these tasteless grease piles on my salad which I couldn't even eat. Although we were dining there, the salad came in a plastic to-go box and pre-packaged dressing in a packet. The chicken was like tasteless rubber.   We checked of the \"Primanti Bros\" box, but won't be back.",

Okay, so it was slow because it was Saturday night, that is understandable. But the way the waitress was handling it? Unacceptable. She was unbelievably rude and had a terrible system of keeping  track of her tables. She was forgetting everyone's order and rarely apologizing. Terrible customer service. I never leave less than a 20% tip, but had to this night. I understand being stressed because it's busy, but you gotta suck it up and put a smile on.  I was so disappointed by this location. It's in a super nice area of downtown and one of the main locations that people from out of town come to try Primanti's. So upsetting. I contacted corporate, so hopefully they get this location in check.",

Looked around, and realized that this restaurant looks awfully like one of the restaurants I saw on the food network where the guy goes around and eats these ridiculously large meals. After eating a Pittsburgher (the second most popular dish) and trying the colossal fish sandwich, and a capicola sandwich, I've decided that the best part of my meal was the IC light.   My friend's colossal fish was the best of the three and it's best eaten as two meals. My Pittsburgher was the pitts and I wouldn't order it again. Unlike your pitts on a 90+ degree day, it was really dry. The sandwich was only salvaged by my grotesque use of hot sauce. The concept isn't that ridiculous either. Just get fries and coleslaw and put it in your sandwich. The chili cheese fries were mediocre as well, but the portion again was hugemongous.  I'd come back here if I were in Pittsburgh again because its just a nice place to chill at on Market Square. But the food is only serviceable. Substituting quantity with quality can only get you so far.  The ambiance, service, atmosphere, and tradition makes this place pretty unique, but it don't make the food taste better.",

I don't think the \"meat\" you order makes a difference in the bland taste, as it's overpowered by the slaw and fries. The bread was dry on the crust and yet soggy from the slaw/oil from fries. The wait staff wasn't friendly either. They seemed to have the \"I don't need try to so hard because we're busy no matter what\" attitude. We had to go up to the bar to get refills on our drinks after waiting over 10 min. for the waitress to notice we were out. The place was constantly busy due to the full bar and nostalgic feel of the restaurant; it had it's own local charm. I'm glad to say I tried it, however I probably wouldn't go back on our next visit.",

Tried the pittsburgher cheesesteak, I was expecting a regular burger patty or sliced steak, ended up being a weird patty almost like a meatloaf (not a burger). Not sure I'd order that again. Pastrami and cheese was still good. Wish the egg came a little runny.",

Like gnats, we were attracted to Primati because their neon sign was... pretty.... soooooo pretty!  Anyway, stopped in here and order the Pittsburgh cheesesteak which was quite tasty. We also got the Cajun chicken sandwich with cheese... because everything there comes with cheese. Everything. Need salt? Even that has cheese on it. It's kinda awesome.  Anyway, both sandwiches were quite tasty and with the fries on top... yummy.  Would definitely come back here next time I'm coming through Pittsburgh, hopefully for longer than a few hours.",

Whether it is steak & cheese, or fish & cheese, or even hot sausages and cheese, man, it is ALL good. With literally a pile of tasty french fries and sauerkraut like cold slaw in the middle, the sandwich is huge, all for under $6. Add a local Yuengling beer (America's oldest and best brewery) if you like.  If the sandwich is too much for you to handle, take a stroll at the tri-state park.  The place is usually very busy at lunch time, with waitresses hustling around, wearing store T-shirt knotted around the waist, dashing in and out (since they do have outdoor tables). On the back of their T's, there is a vivid picture of the gigantic sandwich. When they turn around, you just cannot help notice their boobs too. I guess the sandwiches are as attractive as nice boobs :-)  A drooling place. Period.",

Good amount of meat and other ingredients, fluffy bread, reasonable price. I was visiting downtown Pittsburgh for a conference so I asked for their most popular sandwich, which was the pastrami ($7.39). The sandwich definitely did not disappoint. Pastrami sandwiches tend to be pretty salty, but this wasn't too salty at all. Loved the coleslaw they included. It wasn't the creamy type so the sandwich didn't end up soggy. I was surprised they included fries in the sandwich, but hey, it worked for me so I'm not complaining! I only wished I ate it there since the bread looked so fluffy and mine was smushed by the time I got back to my hotel. It was still tasty though. Would definitely go back if I ever find myself in Pittsburgh again!",

Apparently, this is the place to go to for the sandwiches that include french fries in between the buns so to speak, which is the Pittsburgh way.   The friend warned me that there might not be anything for a vegetarian like me, but I'm glad he was incorrect! They had me covered with several options!   Their famous sandwich is called the Almost Famous Sandwich which has a unilateral base of french fries, coleslaw, tomatoes, and of course bread. The base serves as a jumping off point to a wide variety of options that include your heavy meat choices or the simply cheese combo option (Provolone, American, Swiss) that I selected. These options range from around $5.99-8.99 which is quite reasonable. The sandwich was actually quite delicious and the unique mixture was a nice surprise to the expectation of a conventional sandwich. I really like that you can choose your options - something for everyone!    It's worthy to note that their coleslaw is a vinegar based style, not that heavy mayo doused rendition that you find more in the south. This is important because it helps in not making your sandwich a gut bomb that sticks with you well into the next day. They also have salads which as a vegetarian are always appreciated.   The ambiance is a sports bar type place but in a more welcoming way than normal. It's worth your time to check out and get a feel for how Pittsburgh folks spend their time.",

    "text": "So many people recommending this to us and we ended up at this location based off of proximity to one of our museum stops. The experience did not start off well, but our food was ... decent. I didn't know this place was that \"famous\". I also didn't realize it was a chain until we typed the name into our yelp search. We got in line and there are two guys waiting outside who we get behind. We read a sign that says to wait outside until someone seats you. The guys are with their wives/girlfriends, who are in the incredibly small area in front of the podium. We were waiting for awhile about 5-10 mins. Apparently no one has helped them and they figure that a party of 4 won't get seated based off of a quick scan of the restaurant. When they leave they offer us luck and we stand in front of he podium. Still no one has even walked past us. On the podium is a sign that says - seat yourself- I don't think this is accurate because there are no seats and it's pretty busy how would anyone know we've sat down. However this is the only indication we've gotten about seating. So I walk through to try and find someone everyone is just rushing past I finally have manage to call out to a waitress (?) and ask her if we seat ourselves. She seems completely irritated that I would even think that. She walks over to the podium sees the sign - which is a two sided sign by the way - and hangs it on the wall in a huff with the side that says to wait to be seated. She says it'll be a minute. Now at this time there are three other parties behind us. Who would have not gotten seated because no one was attending podium or even checking to see if people are there. Some crowds leave and there is promise of a seat! Finally we get seated in an extremely tight seat and order. My family all ordered different sandwiches. They come with slaw and fries on top as well as tomatoes. I got the kielbasa, which flavor wise was really good. I opted for now tomatoes and added onions. Our waiter was nice and attentive a little quiet, but his niceness made up for our first experience. Maybe she wasn't the -hostess- and I'm sure she was overwhelmed. But she did not leave us with a great first impression. Anyway the food was - ehh. The bread wasn't anything special and it wasn't warm or anything. The rest of my sandwich just tasted cold when it came out. I guess because of the slaw. I feel like there could be a better way to prepare it. Overall my family enjoyed their sandwiches, I didn't. Maybe I needed a \"hotter\" meat, like a burger. If you want to stop at this famous sandwich place - maybe choose a different location? This one is close to the arena and downtown so it gets a lot of traffic and maybe that's why not everything was up to par. Oh and side note. The sandwiches don't come on plates - they come on that generic hoagie/sandwich paper and the waiters/waitresses just hold your open sandwiches in their flimsy paper all bundled up in their arms. And just slide it on the table. Very strange.",

Through the best of fortunes, my friend whom I was meeting for lunch works very close to the Market Square location, so we decided to meet there.  I was not disappointed...not in the least! Actually, I was surprised at how moist and delicious a sandwich laden down (in the best possible way) with cheese, cold cuts, cole slaw and french fries could be. And the service was great, too - I was worried that not being a local/regular might work against me, but our server was very friendly and helped to make this a great lunch experience. Since I was continuing on my eastward trek, I passed on the Yuengling's and opted for a ginger ale. (I THINK it was a Vernor's...it better had been!)   My only wish for Primanti's is that they had more vegetarian options (I know, I know...when in Rome, but my friend is a vegetarian and didn't have much to choose from on the menu). Also, trying to park in Market Square was, for want of a better word...trying. Not the restaurant's problem to solve, but I could imagine that those coming in who aren't on foot would like an easier way to leave their cars behind. Primanti Brothers is definitely worth the trip!",

When we got the sandwiches both of them were overstuffed with the meat, French fries, cole slaw and tomatoes. I asked for my sandwich with no tomatoes and the coleslaw on the side and a side of ranch.  The sandwiches came in fresh Italian bread and with lots of napkins.

The guy sitting next to me could tell I was not a local, so he suggested ordering the Capicola to get the True primanti brothers experience.  Whenever possible and if we think it will taste right, we like to order a fried egg on the sandwich. And so, they added that as well. My husband and I decided to share this since the portions are so huge.   The sandwich itself was really tasty and yummy and I could see why it is a Pittsburgh favorite. If we are ever in the area again, we will come back to try the other options that they have.",

Next came our entrees and she got the pittsburger which came with fries and cole slaw on it and I got a kielbasa with cheese which also came with fries and cole slaw, and we also shared some freakin delicious chili cheese fries.

I split a roast beef and provolone with the cole slaw and fries (on the sandwich of course). The roast beef is thin cut and served hot almost like cheese steak meat with the provolone melted on top. They also add lettuce, tomato, vinegar based cole slaw (I hate mayo and liked this cole slaw since no mayo), and of course a ton on fries to the sandwich. The fries are actually pretty good on the sandwich but combine that with an Iron City beer (great beer) and their chili cheese fries (chili was good but they use \"fake cheese\" sauce which hardens in your stomach like a brick) and you'll have a great Pittsburgh meal that you won't even be able to finish before you get full.   Where else but here can you get a sandwich like this for about the price of a Subway sub? I'd say you'll take 20 yrs off your life if you eat here more than once a month though!  Oh and this being Pittsburgh they of course had the Pens game on every TV in the place. It's great if you're a Pens fan but good luck trying to catch any other sports on the TV!",

The bread was the big player on these sandwiches. Soft but firm enough to hold together the meat, cheese, slaw, fries, tomato, and onions (optional but worth it). If I had my choice between an RUHUNGRY fat sandwich or one of these, yikes! Sorry RUHUNGRY but The Primanti Bros. win this battle!  What's wrong with it?

I loved my bologna sandwich, you can't beat the prices for a place that's loved by locals and demanded by tourists, and I'd be sure to stop back (at any location) when I'm back in the Steel City.",

The burgers are strange (to this SF kid) Coleslaw, fries, and a burger with a almost meatloaf consistency, oozy cheese, and downright delicious!! The fries are great as is the chili. Had to try the hotdog sandwich as well, so good. Of course not super high quality ingredients but that's not what you're looking for coming into this place. Especially if it's your first time in Pittsburgh you gotta go!",

The meal started off pretty well with $2 Yuenglings and amazing chili, cheese, sour cream and bacon fries.  However, things took a turn for the worse when the famous sandwiches came out.  Two of us had the turkey and one had the colossal fish.  I thought the turkey was slimy and tasted weird.  The fries added almost no flavor to the sandwich, and the cole slaw was gross.  The bread was terrible, and overall, the sandwich made me nauseous.  Totally not worth it, unless you just go for the fries and drinks.",

    "text": "I was in Pittsburgh for the 4th of July weekend to check out their fireworks and I visited the Market Sq. location on the 4th, place wasn't really packed when I arrived. I needed to feed myself, my wife and my two kids. I ordered a hot sausage and cheese for myself, a black angus top sirlion and cheese for the wife and split a order of 6 chicken fingers for the kids (it comes with fries, what a deal!). After I placed my order I waited by the bar and unfortunately it was when the death of Steve Mcnair started to air :-(. The bar quickly filled up after I placed my order. The sandwiches took a little while to prepare and not as quick as I've heard they are. I got my order and in my usual fashion I checked it. No chicken finger and fries....bummer. I go back to the cashier/bartender/cook and asked her for my order who asks the cook where it is and he shrugs like \"I dunno\" so , she grabs some new chicken fingers and tosses them into the fryer so now I have to wait even longer for my food. I was planning to take it to go and eat at my hotel because there was no free parking out front. My hotel is by the airport so I wanted the sandwiches to be fresh as possible so that I can get the full experience. The chicken fingers took even longer to prepare so I am waiting and hoping my food doesn't get cold. Finally, after awhile watching the news my order is ready and I dash out and drive back to my hotel. First let me say the kids INHALED the chicken fingers like I never seen them do before and they have tried chicken fingers everywhere. The fries they didn't care for so much. I ate half my sandwich which was no longer hot and it wasn't bad, my wife didn't really care for hers since the amount of steak was skimpy. We would definitely try Primanti's again just not the ones we got this time and we will eat them at the location so that they are fresh as another complaint my wife had was the ingredients didn't seem fresh. I can cross Primanti's off my list of things to do in the da 'burgh. Now if I can only get over my fear of heights and ride those inclines.",

I like disgusting junk food as much as anyone (see my rave review of the O), but I wish the primanti's goons would put a little bit more effort into their sandwiches. seriously guys -- take some pride in your work and make something good for once. and check the thermostat on your fryolator already!",

We wanted to try something special to the Pittsburgh area and settled on Primanti Brothers with this location in Market Square.   There's a bunch of Primanti Brothers in the Pittsburgh and surrounding area and they are all known for their sandwiches.  Big fat sandwiches of deli meats stacked on freshly cut grilled Italian bread slathered with coleslaw and french fries in one single easy (well not so easy) to eat package!  In fact the original Primanti Brother's idea was to make an all in sandwich that workers can eat in one hand.  In have to admit I can see why they are so popular and are a local institution.  The freshly hand cut bread is grilled and stuffed with meat, coleslaw and fries which is in fact a delicious combo!  All sandwiches are served in paper wrap as no knives, forks or even plates are given!  We really enjoyed our meal here and next time we are in the area we would definitely be back for more.  Well done Primanti Brother's!  You are my kids second favorite brothers after the Mario Bros now!  Haha!",

My fiance doesn't like cabbage so he didn't get the slaw on his Joe, Dick, & Stanley. The portion sizes are HUGE! And the food was so incredible. The waiter we had was so different than anyone we have ever run into in the south (where we live). He had a little bit of that northern bluntness which was totally endearing. I originally told him I didn't want coleslaw on my Reuben (because I'm thinking mayonnaise-y southern coleslaw) and he was like \"but that's the kraut, you gotta have it!\" I'm so glad I listened to him. The slaw was nothing like I imagined it to be. It was very kraut-like with a slaw crunch. Delicious! 10/10 would recommend.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch mid afternoon for the first time on a Sunday.  I ordered the New Yorker, hubby ordered the Ragin Cajun, and we ordered the Terror Tots.  What's hot - Freshness.  Love love love the freshness of all the ingredients.  Saw the cook regularly slice fresh bread slices for all the sandwiches.  Never saw a frozen french fry.  In fact, I saw fresh cut french fries being poured outta buckets.  Their coleslaw and tomatoes are fresh, as well.  Our terror tots had fresh jalapeno slices.  Definitely adds a kick. - Quality.  The flavor of my New Yorker sandwich was delish!  Could definitely taste the pastrami.  Even though there are fries in the sandwich, it's not overly salty, which is important.  Could definitely taste the stone ground deli mustard in my sandwich.  Additionally, the food isn't very greasy, which is a definite plus. - Portions. You can hold your sandwich with one hand, but you better eat it with two!  Otherwise, your fillings fall out.   - Prices.  It's about $10 per sandwich, so it's not cheap.  But you're getting good quality for your prices.  What's not - Service.  We sat at the counter, right next to the grill, so our waiter was the cook.  None of the other staff checked in on us during our time there.  The cook is already hella busy and he wasn't getting much help for our orders.  Put it this way, we didn't get refills on our drinks and the cook had to bring up our check instead of one of the wait staff.  The other staff were doing their jobs, but everything looked haphazard.  It looks like they need a better system or more help.   - Layout.  This place is hella busy.  Their Strip District location is open 24/7, which tells you something.  As a result, it's not always easy to find seating, especially at a table.  Their counter seats seem to be the most flexible.  If you're a party of 2, I recommend counter seats.  Anything more, good luck.  Final answer Would definitely come back, but recommend finding as close to a down time as you can.",

Before coming to Pittsburgh, I was advised to make a trip to Primanti Brothers because of their famous sandwiches. I just didn't know how good they would be, until now. All their sandwiches have meats, french fries, coleslaw, tomato, all piled up high and they are just fantastic. My friend got his with tuna, but I got the traditional Pitts-burger. This was one great thing to enjoy and was able to eat the whole thing. It took a minute how to figure out how to eat it, but wow was this good.   The location is also great as its on the Pittsburgh \"strip\" and was not terribly far from PNC Park, so it gave us great proximity and a overall base as to getting a feel around the city. Plus all the walking will give you a chance to walk off those calories before the Pirates game begins!   For this spot, it is okay to be a tourist. Just get here like we did before the lunch rush, otherwise you could be staring at a really long wait. But this was worth it! Plus the prices were amazing too! Awesome!",

    "text": "Okay, so this place was recommended on several \"what to eat in Pittsburgh\" spots; but the 3 start on yelp initially had me bypassing this experience. Thank goodness I decided that it was worth the chance to experience it (yelp reviews are impt). We needed to grab a bite b4 our flight out and having a quick sandwich seemed like the best idea. Now I'm not really a \"buy a sandwich at a restaurant\" person and decided I would get a burger as pictured on the yelp page.  As I'm reviewing the menu, I don't see any burgers or pizzas as pictured. The man next to me has a sandwich w/what I thought was Cole slaw on the side.  Well the Primanti's in the Market Place ONLY serves Sandwiches!!! Market place is the REAL DEAL and the other locations in the Suburbs are gentrifying the restaurant. So on to the food...I ordered the Cajun chicken sandwich! Now I was a little nervous with the Cole slaw and didn't realize fries came on the sandwich (not a fry person); but \"when in Rome\" I was Not Disappointed!!! The sandwich was huge, tasty, and even better with hot sauce! I really took a leap and was so happy! I ate the whole damn thing which I didn't think was possible! I also ordered the huge drink with the little ducky in it solely for the souvenir!  My colleague ordered the tator tots which were amazing and crispy w/some dipping sauce! In the market place try to avoid lunch time hours!",

What a fun show, not really a show but it was a lot of fun watching employees.  It was very crowded because it was after the steeler opening game.  We stood in line for about 30 minutes.  So worth it :). The staff was very professional but interactive with customers.  Sandwiches came out very quick.  What s combination. Coleslaw and French fries on a sandwich.  This place came highly recommended from locals and people on our flight.  So glad we went. Will defined go back next time in area",

    "text": "4.5 stars.  On several recommendations since we came to town we decided to try this place.  I can definately see what all the hype is about!    My buddy and I ordered two sandwiches and split them, the cappicola and the pastrami.  They were great.  I preferred the pastrami slightly over the other but they were both great.  The waitress said the best way to eat them is to put hot sauce right on the slaw.  Great recommendation.  The bread was bulky but soft and held up nicely to the last bite.  The slaw that they used was great and like nothing I've had before.  It was vinegar based but not too strong.    It was a cool atmosphere and they had an outdoor seating area.  The staff was fun and energetic.  Great late night food after a night of drinking.  I would definately recommend this place to a friend.",

This will be the reason for me to return to Primanti.",

No. But it's the novelty of it as well as the blue collar appeal that keeps me coming back. The meats are pretty tasteless as is the bread and cheese. Really all you have here is a wad of protein and carbs that tastes like potatoes with a hint of vinegar from the slaw. To give it a negative review, tho, is to misunderstand its original purpose: to provide a filling lunch all in one convenient package. This isn't a gourmet experience and to review it as such would be pretentious. I enjoy it from the perspective of a  1930s delivery driver looking for a hearty lunch that won't break the bank. To him, this would be a winner!",

HOWEVER, I was willing to give them a pass seeing as it was the day of a Steelers home game and that place was PACKKKKED. (I've done my fair share of service work and I know days like that can be a real bitch) Moving along...after I ordered for myself and my handsome ginger sidekick, I was oozing with excitement to get my butt in a seat and chow down on this sandwich I had heard about all weekend!   Fast Forward THIRTY. MINUTES. LATER. We get our food.  Ok, I get it, your busy. But let me reiterate here: FOUR tables were served before we were. And we only got two sandwiches. Insert pissed emoji here.   So, after all was said and done, my sandwich was just ok. Nothing to write home about. The service blew it for me. And I was so pumped too. Damn.",

First off I must say the Pittsburger was everything it promised to be and I was very happy with my meal. However! The young man that served me was so rude it was appalling! He ignored me as I waited to be seated and only came over when a Caucasian couple came up behind me and even then tried to seat them ahead of me. The lady had to point out that I was there first. Then, I swear if this young man could have thrown my food on the floor to serve me he would've! He literally could not have made me feel any more unwelcome. This is the first time in my life I have ever walked away from a restaurant without tipping and I've had bad service before but tonight I felt like I was treated less than human and that's inexcusable!",

Market Square was bustling with vendors everywhere and we got a seat on the patio which was good because inside is crazy loud.  Service was quick and our drinks came out in a timely manner.   I ordered the Pitsburger and Cheese, which is a spicy burger on fresh Italian bread, with the fries, coleslaw and tomato on top.    The bread was super fresh and the sandwich so thick it was hard for me to take a complete bite.    The meat was a bit spicy for me,  but the overall flavor was good.    Others in my group got the roast beef and the pastrami, and being it was their first time here I was anxious to hear their reaction because when I explained the sandwiches, they didn't think it sounded appealing.   Fortunately they both liked their sandwiches and were happy to have indulged in a Pittsburgh tradition.",

My crew had the kielbasa sandwich and the ham sandwich respectively. They looked great.  I don't think fries on my sandwich works for me either. I can't hold it against them though.  I chose poorly.

Yeah soup and wings and fries are there- but 90% of menu is sandwich- from egg to sardine to burger to all types of lunch meat.  Formula: thick cut fresh fluffy white bread that barely holds it all together; very tasty shredded vinegar slaw with nice horseradish kick; very fresh soft-fried fries (we call them Boardwalk style here- well cooked, browned, but not crispy- they are soft); fresh tomato, cheese- then the meat. I got fried fish; wife did pastrami; son did capicola. All very tasty and filling. Not high-class, not organic or sustainable or remotely low carb or low fat- but simple, filling, tasty, protein-carb calorie bomb to the gut!! Good beer on tap; few liquors at bat but they can't mix Manhattan (!). Service brusque but on point and quick to booze you up!! So as a Ravens fan Baltimore boy I'll admit  Primantis is good! But Steelers still suck ass!!  Caw Caw!!!",

I had expected the mayonnaise component of the Cole slaw to keep the sandwich from drying out. Unfortunately, their slaw is almost all cabbage, so it only added to the dryness.  The bread also seemed needlessly thick and took over the entire sandwich at times. I wonder if a modernized version of this classic could build on the elements that work -- great chicken, great fries -- and take it to the next level.  Even some BBQ or dijonnaise on top could do wonders for this sandwich.",

Food was same as other locations and just what I was looking for. Service however was pathetic. And not to blame our server but the location was obviously understaffed. Waited 20 minutes to order a beer and a sandwich. Waited another 10 for the beer... won't be back to this location.",

I was surprised that that fries (which are on the sandwich) aren't soggy. I selected the beef. Only three stars because although it has fresh flavor it's very plain. No spices or fresh herbs makes it a very flat sandwich experience.",

I often get cheese fries to go for lunch. You get a decent amount for $3.50 (for downtown standards). The only sucky thing is that the fries are normally cold.. not warm, cold. -_- they make up for by pouring scalding hot cheese sauce all over to mask the cold fries. Well played my friend. it doesnt stop me from coming once every 2 months",

    "text": "My husband and I just arrived in town. I am originally from the area. My first thought was to get a Primanti Sandwich, of course! We walked directly to this location from our hotel right after checking in. Upon arriving, hostess asked us if we would like to sit at the bar. We thought it might be fun to watch them make the sandwiches. There were random seats, one in an area that we thought would block the servers from picking up drinks. My husband asked a male (maybe in his late 20's, medium build, darker hair with a beard) standing behind the area if we would be in anyone's way sitting there. Easy question, right? His reply to my husband in a very condescending tone, \" if you sit at the bar, you are sitting at the bar. If you sit at a table, you are sitting at a table.\" Then walked away!!! After recovering from complete shock as to how rude he had been, we immediately left. We walked directly across the square to Diamond Market where we had great service, great food and got to sit outside enjoying the square. Here is the saddest part, my husband owns 10 \"RESTAURANTS \" in Florida. He employs over 600 people! I was the one that asked him if we could go to Primanti's only for him to be treated like crap by some young condescending punk! I have lots of friends and family here and I will certainly be sharing this info. My advice: avoid this location! We obviously will NEVER be back.",

We also had the loaded tots which were amazing and I could have stuffed my face with them all day long but my belly just couldn't handle any more.   Super friendly and efficient staff. They know how to work a lunch crowd. One staff in particular stood out. She was this guy's angel.   A little old man walked in. He was maybe 5 feet tall. He had a box. He opened the box and looked at her and said can you help me. She said sure. He asked where he would go to find out if he was a winner. Long story short he was holding a small cardboard box with his hearing aid batteries in it. He kept asking if they were winners or where he could go to see if they were winners. No-one could really figure out what he wanted. She asked him to hold on and she gave him a bottled water which he sucked down quickly. She then gave him another water and a vat of fries. He didn't eat the fries but she kept him occupied long enough for the police/paramedics to come. They were kind to him and they ended up loading him into the ambulance to check him over. HE said he felt ok but his sugars may have been a bit off or he just got a little confused on the way here. He had taken the bus in town. He gave the police his address and his emergency number. His nephew did not answer. They called his high-rise apartment and LM for them.   This place was great for their food. But to watch this unfold in front of us and see how the staff handled it!? This place would be a got to of mine for sure. Stellar staff with really good food!",

Well on a business trip to Pittsburgh, I lightning bolted over to this place as soon as I got off the plane.  Point blank, this sandwich IS worth all the hype. As excited as I was, I was slightly skeptical about how fries and slaw would mix with some of the sandwiches. So I ordered the Pastrami sandwich which comes with the aforementioned on top... It was straight up unbelievable. Surprisingly, everything mixed perfectly together and the bread even stood out as being very good.   If you're a health conscience, then it makes absolutely no sense to come here at all. You're here for the most unhealthy and delicious sandwich you'll ever have, so keep that in mind. That being said, this is place is delicious and it's an absolute must when visiting Pittsburgh.",

The sandwiches come with fries, \"cole slaw\" actually on the burger with this very thick bread. The sandwich didn't have much seasoning and just felt like a carb overload.

It was a decent sandwich, but the fries and the coleslaw were just an unnecessary mess.  The fries became soggy in the sandwich and we ended up taking all the additions off and eating them as a side.   Maybe after a couple of drinks this greasy sandwich would be more appealing.  If for some reason I do end up going again, I'll likely head to a different location.  Market Square is a hassle to park in.

    "text": "Super-sized Italian-style deli sandwiches at super-reasonable prices. You can't go wrong with just about anything, provided you're not vegetarian or vegan, in which case you'll probably have to stick with salads. The New Yorker (pastrami, corned beef, swiss, spicy mustard) and the Capone (capicola, salami, Italian sausage, provolone) are solid bets, and don't say you weren't warned when you're ordering these \"tall boys.\" They mean it.   If you're out with a group, more gluttony is in order, whether it means ordering tons of loaded tots or some of their wings, tenders, fried pickles, or mozzarella wedges. Simply a classic Pittsburgh experience all around, especially at this particularly boisterous downtown location.",

    "text": "Our Lyft driver recommended Primanti Bros to us.  We ate outside and enjoyed the calm and quiet atmosphere.  We shared The Capone sandwich which consisted of capicola, salami, slaw, fries, and tomato.  The sandwich was enormous; I'm so glad that we decided to share!  The meat was fresh and the fries and slaw added a nice balance.  We also got the Terror Tots which were tator tots with queso, sriracha, and jalapenos.  They were delicious.  The only thing I didn't like about the tots was that the jalapenos were not pickled, but that's a matter of preference.  The service was just average.  We needed refills and didn't get them, that's a big deal for me.  The waiter was nice, but I don't like to be thirsty when I'm eating.  Overall though, the food was excellent and I would eat there again.",

After my waiter shared some of the fan favorites, I ordered the cajun chicken sandwich. The bread was super fluffy and the chicken was perfectly seasoned. Can't say I'm a fan of the cole slaw and fries on the sandwich but hey, it's a Pittsburgh tradition! To reiterate, the sandwich is huge; I was stuffed after finishing it.",

We were a bigger group than they were really equipped to host (4 adults, a teenager, 2 kids, and a baby), but you would have thought I asked the host to clear the restaurant for us. We agreed to sit outside so we didn't have a wait and they were not happy having to move tables together or letting us sit by the heaters in an attempt to keep the kids warm.   The food we got was okay, but not mind blowing. I got a sandwich and was excited about the concept, but was overall not impressed. Having slaw and fries in the sandwich on white bread led to it being kind of bland. It needed a lot of hot sauce, which was thankfully out on each table.   We did get fries as a side/appetizer to keep the kids entertained, and they were tasty. The chicken fingers the kids got were absolutely delicious and I, honestly, would have preferred to eat those rather than my sandwich.   I've been here once and don't know that I'd need to come back if I was in town again.",

The sandwich was very small, but I only ate 1/2 of it anyway, and I have a pretty big appetite. I recently ate a 20 oz cheeseburger at a local burger joint.  I was truly shocked. That was the worst meat that I have seen since Junior High School. We would have been much better off at Burger King.

I went to Pittsburgh to watch a Charger vs. Steeler game and before I could leave this great city of Pittsburgh, I had to try a Primanti Bros sandwich.   When we got there, the line was long and we had to wait a little while to grab a couple seats up at the bar (where you can watch them make the sandwiches). It took an even longer time for the server to actually make eye contact with us and take our order. Hence, we didn't come here for the service.   When we finally got our sandwiches and side order of french fries loaded with cheese on top we were in heaven. I ordered the corned beef and cheese and my boyfriend ordered the turkey breast and cheese. Neither one of us were complaining about what we ordered, we were stuffed after eating 1/2 the sandwich. The french fries with cheese on top were finger-licking good!   If you're in Pittsburgh, Primanti Bros is a must!",

Ordered a grilled chicken salad, take out. Got back to the hotel and found it had a pile of tasteless, cold french fries on it...so cold they never melted the shredded orange cheese-food underneath them. Also no salt or ketchup was included, so even if I DID want to eat stone cold, unseasoned fries, they would suck. The balsamic dressing I ordered was replaced by (fake) raspberry vinaigrette, so repulsive it required a trip all the way back  to the restaurant to get the correct dressing, which they were out of. Would have been nice to have been asked, since they did have Italian on hand - seems like a closer match. The iceberg lettuce, olive, and tomato salad, oh yeah, it did have a bit of chicken on it too, was okay once I scraped all that orange congealed \"cheese\" off.  That and all the smokers hanging around the place (and Pittsburgh in general), I would say this place is a totally over-rated dump.",

Yes, if you are in PIT you should probably go once just to say you've been there.

The coleslaw is gross and I'm a fan of coleslaw. Due to the 90 min wait I was given a gift card which I used at the one in Market Square. This time I got the grilled chicken salad. If you like chewing on rubber bands, I recommend it. It was the absolute worst salad I've ever had, how can you screw up a salad? The chicken was tasteless and rubbery. Got it to go and the girl who took the order over the phone was rude and rushed and was equally rude when I picked it up. She assumed she knew my name and my order and handed me a random bag of food. I told her I was missing a sandwich and she tossed another bag at me without saying a word. I will NEVER go back to any of these locations. I'd rather eat a ham sandwich from Sheetz. At least I can get that without an attitude. If you have friends coming to visit from out of town, take them anywhere but here. And for those who say you have to go to the original one in the Strip, no thanks, it's the same food. If you are looking for an awesome sandwich go to Schmitz Old World Deli in Greenfield.",

    "text": "Well, it finally happened: I had to give a place a single star. And it kills me that the place I gave it to had to be Primanti's. I'm an awful Pittsburgher.  I don't give low ratings easily or often, so believe me: this place pushed all of my buttons to earn this awful review. In fact, the single star was only earned because the place is cleaner and more comfy than some of the other Primanti places I've been too. It kind of has an old diner feeling to it and I liked that.   Alas, that's all I liked.  So, why such a low score? Well:  The service was terrible. After spending twenty minutes sitting without anyone coming to refill my water or ask for my actual order - note, the place was almost completely empty - I went to the register to ask for something to eat, which I'd started to think I had to do after watching a couple people do the same (in hindsight, I probably misinterpreted their actions, but my mistake does not excuse what happened next). My waiter looked at me and went, \"Don't you get the concept of a restaurant? Haven't you been to any restaurants, like, ever? Sit back down and I'll take your order.\"   And not even in a joking manner that made me feel like I could smile about my mistake - this guy was being a condescending, rude, arrogant person. It was unbelievable. Utterly, totally unbelievable. If I hadn't met company there that night, I would have walked out right then.  To make matters worse, this was not a good night to order anything at Primanti's. The coleslaw was way too sweet and there was far too much of it, the fries were bland and had no texture at all, and there was barely any meat on my sandwich at all. The result? A big pile of carbs that really didn't taste great after the first few bites, rather than a delicious sandwich.  Before you all kill me, please note: I LIKED my meal at Mt. Lebanon's Primanti location. They also have a more diverse menu, which is always a bonus for me - I like having more options. I think in the future, I will stick to that location in this local chain, where even on a busy night I managed to get food in a decent amount of time. I certainly will not be coming to the downtown location if I spot my previous, downright awful waiter working there again.",

We went to the one at \"PPG.\" The place was busy but not crowded on a Friday night.  The menu was on the wall along with murals of Pittsburgh's finest sports starts.  Our server was quick and efficient and we never were in need of refills or anything else.  I got the Pitts-burgher cheese steak and we tried an order of the Smallman Street Fries.  The fries were truly loaded.  The chili had a nice kick to it and there was literally an ice cream scoop of sour cream on top.  However, the fries were actually seasoned that well and were under done in my opinion.  That didn't bode well for the fries on the sandwich, but I kept my hopes high.  The sandwich comes out and its a monster.  I love the italian bread, the beef patty and cheese, the slaw was good (shredded cabbage, not like southern cole slaw).  Everything was fresh but, again, the fries were the worst part.  Underdone, underseasoned.  Definitely my least favorite part.  Nonetheless, I would definitely return because I want to try some of the other menu items.  I've heard double-meat is the way to go.  I'm intrigued.",

Firstly, the food had no flavor. That has nothing to do with our party size. I ordered the sardine & cheese, but in our party there were grilled chicken sandwiches, black bean burgers, & cheese steaks ordered. The sandwiches were big, especially for the price. But no flavoring, just overcooked, unseasoned meat with too many steak fries (in the sandwich) & weak cheese. The only seasoning available are salt, pepper, hot sauce, & ketchup. BIG disappointment.   I'll cut them slack on the service because we were a big party, but they couldn't handle it well. Their stress was evident, & it took away from their service.  If it were me by myself or one other person, it would be 1 star. But the second start is pity for the party size",

It tasted more like meat-loaf than a burger, not even some cole-slaw and fries on the actual sandwich could salvage this - imagine how bad it must be if even that can't help.  We had an order of Buffalo wings as well, they would have to be included in a conversation of the worst wings we've ever had.  The tater-tots were great, should definitely stay on the menu.    The service and the beer selection was fine, especially the service.  Glasses were never empty for long, they would even ask to fill up right before you were done.  Super helpful to any questions we may have had.  We were immediately seated, even though they were swamped and working their asses off.

    "text": "Why waste time? Want a sandwich, fries and slaw? Put it all in one, this is what Primati Bro's  does.   Every sandwich here is huge, not really due to the protein, but due to the handful(s) of fried and slaw and the thick bread each one is built with. I opted for the Colossal fish and cheese sandwich (6.99).  The fish had a nice crisp batter, the fires were a bit soggy , the bread was nice and soft and the slaw was decent.  Alone I loved the fish, All together the starch of the bread and fried over power the fish. There was hot sauce at the table to help add flavor (frank's red hot style).   Seating is odd, seat your self and you will get service when you are noticed. Drink come in to go cups and the menu is on paper for you to keep as notice to you doctor of your  1000+ calorie meal.   My coworker also got the cheese fires for extra cholesterol and to max his per diem. Cheese wiz smothered soggish fries. It was decent but it did not blow me away by any means.  Bottom line, if you are a tourist, give it a try, if you are a local come for the nostalgic name.",

One of the best things about it was when I asked the girl what the number one seller was, as they only listed the number two on the menu, she said it was beer. That's my type of place. I had seen this mentioned on several Food Network shows and since we were in town to watch the Cardinals vs the Bucs thought we'd give it a try. We've been there, we've tried it, that box is checked. Great place for the atmosphere so don't not go because of this review. The service was awesome, even with a very busy and boisterous crowd.",

Yes, that is all on one sandwich.  It feels like a heart attack in a rectangular package but is simultaneously delicious.  I personally love the Angus black steak but the most popular version is definitely the cheesesteak, which I would guess is Pittsburgh's version of the Philly cheesesteak.  I also like the carved turkey breast version as well, which is a good option for a semi-lighter option.  This location is pretty low-key and akin to a bar but ot's usually packed and its prime location in Market Square makes it a popular lunch spot.",

We also tried the fried pickles and they were not fried correctly they were very chewy. Just something to mention they don't use plates they give the sandwich on a parchment paper so that it's easier to wrap up. Also the place was unclean at times as they were only two guys for the entire restaurant. I had heard a lot and was told to visit this place but my visit was nothing special. It is right in the heart of Market Square but we were there on Easter so everything was closed",

    "text": "Primanti's is a Pittsburgh classic, and I've always felt some sort of obligation to love this place. Although I can certainly appreciate the uniqueness of a Primanti's sandwich, I just don't understand all the hype. So there I was again, hoping this was the time I finally become a Primanti's fanatic.  The restaurant was very busy when we came in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. There was a bit of a wait, but the employees were efficient when it came to getting us seated as quickly as possible. Our waitress, however, seemed too preoccupied with other customers, so we spent a lot of time waiting to get her attention. Frustrating, but it is what it is.   They offer two vegetarian sandwich options: the Deluxe Double Egg & Cheese and the Southwest Black Bean Burger. Both are good, and I've always preferred the black bean burger, but I decided to give the egg & cheese another shot. It was an average quality sandwich. Nothing mind-blowing. Though I usually love how they pile on the fries, these fries were so undercooked to the point where the insides were RAW. Once again, Primanti's, you have failed to impress me.  Purely because it's Primanti's, I will probably be back. If it was any other sandwich shop, no thanks.",

And after getting up at 2 am to catch 2 flights, a 23 ounce mug of this classic lager definitely hit the spot. For my sandwich, I ordered the Pittsburgher, their second biggest seller. I love the vinegar slaw and the bright color and flavor of the tomatoes. Those fries are definitely fresh. The only thing I didn't care for was the burger itself. The beef not only got overwhelmed by the other ingredients, but it just did not taste like fresh beef.   The total came to around $16, more than reasonable. I would still return when I visit, but I'd opt for a different sandwich.",

I noticed the prices were really good and even had drink specials for 6 days of the week. There were a few good sounding burgers as well so it had me thinking about what I really wanted. Once I chose and received my order I noticed the servings were huge just like the pictures! I wish other places advertisements actually matched their servings. Save to say I left full (which is a surprise because I can eat). The other cool thing is the location so there's plenty to do before and after. Make a stop here if you have the chance.",

We had the opportunity to watch our team practice and afterward, a group of us decided to have lunch at the famous Primanti. We walked from the arena to the restaurant, which took about 20 minutes.  The GPS used off Yelp took us on a scenic route, and later we found out it would have been easier to take the Transit and get off the Gateway stop.  Seating inside is first come first serve and we grabbed a few tables. The menu had everything kind of sandwich you could think of, but according to the menu: it's not a Primanti Brothers signature sandwich without a generous serving of crunchy, tart coleslaw and crisp French Fries piled high on top of soft Italian bread.  I shared a pastrami sandwich with Stephen, and they were served on waxed paper, not even on plates. Indeed their sandwich was served on top of a layer of french fries, coleslaw, and cheese, piled higher than a mouth could open. Fortunately for us, our server tossed in a few forks.  My friends LeeAnne and Sandy chose not to get the sandwich, and shared the BLT Tots, while Karen had the Pitts-Burger.  Lunch was relatively inexpensive, and the sandwiches were large enough to share.",

The Bologna was as good as a bologna sandwich gets. Because of all the addition on the sandwich (the fries, veggies, and sauces) the bologna flavor was not overpowering, but just right.    Capicola & Cheese very good. I liked the meat flavor and combination of sauces.   Pastrami & Cheese has been my favorite so far. It was just enough spice and the pastrami was delicious. I had some trouble eating it as at the sandwich is so large.  These sandwiches are big enough to split if you usually eat small meals like me or more then filling by them selves.   Make sure to put your sandwich with a beer! If you are in Pittsburgh this is a must stop!",

I ordered the pastrami because I heard there was nothing really different about their burgers and I don't think there is anything much different about their pastrami sandwich either. It is big (I order with an egg, double meat, and onions) and I could barely finish it. One sandwich can easily feed two people, but I never back down from a challenge! The bread was nice and soft and the sandwich had a nice kick, but it really is just is a larger than normal sandwich.",

Our little group, which inlcuded the parents(yeah i still get free food) went to the Market Square location. The location is nice. Market Square is a nice area. Brick inlaid street. Clsoe to 3 river point park and my hotel. This restaurant is something one must do when in town. It was also on Food Network, and man times reviewed here at Yelp. The food is pretty good. Where else can you get a \"value meal\" between to slices of bread. The sandwiches for those just learning. Your choice of meat with some nice itailian deli selections, kolbassi(haven't seen that  on a menu i around SF), or fish, below a nice bed of fresh made and not too dripping wet coleslaw. Fries with that? Heck yes and they sit right on top.  All on a Itialian sliced bread. The have a daily beer special 24oz beer for about  $2.50.  Now this place and the food is fun. The food gets better tasting as the hours get late on a night out. Think how great a bacon wrapped dog is after \"dancing\" the night away. You know that fun 3 step dance. Raise beer, tip glass, put back down. The kind of food and place you want to head when you cheat on your diet, watch some footbal and chat up with the locals. The staff was very good. The food came quick. Best of all. It had no kick back later or the next day.",

Much like referring to Kleenex, to native yinzers, you just go and get a Primanti's.  No need for any further descriptives.    The secret to the sandwich is the bread: thickly sliced Mancini's bread.  Rumor has it that Primanti's opened a location in Florida.  It didn't do very well because they weren't able to get the Mancini's.  There you go.  My favorite version of the Primanti's is the steak and cheese.  It's a beef patty and cheese (not sliced beef as in a cheese steak).  This is the only thing I will eat tabasco on.  Fresh, thick cut fries and mild vinegar based cole slaw.  Piled up perfection.  Only visit the Strip District location for the full effect.  The other locations pale in comparison.",

Took quite a while to come over to greet us and just asked us what we wanted to drink. We ordered a few beers and waters, while we got our beers right away it took about 15 minutes to get the waters. He also stopped mid-sentence he used the term \"hold on\" to go to another table. Nate needs to work on his serving skills. I say all of this after working in a restaurant for many years. But, the food was fantastic! And I'm sure other servers are very good at what they do. Just don't have Nate as your server.",

Having said that, while the inclusion of an enormous amount of fries and coleslaw on the sandwich was great, the tiny piece of beef \"patty\" that can only be described as something they use as a weight watchers/jenny craig portion leaves much to be desired. I honestly felt like I was eating some sort of vegetarian sandwich with a tiny piece of shriveled up beef patty lost somewhere in between the enormous slices of Italian bread.  On the plus side, the Oakland location does have a pretty sweet deal for after 10pm, where a sandwich and drink was 3 or 4 bucks.",

As others have mentioned, the signature toppings of cole slaw (which I normally loathe, but, in this case, loved!), french fries and cheese accompany any of your \"meat\" choices for a sandwich.  The menu is limited, and there are no frills or False pretenses here.  I would definitely eat here again!  I had the fish and cheese sandwich, and it was outstanding!  I can't give the place 5 stars, because it didn't completely wow me, and the others in my party were a little disappointed.  I think they may have just made bad choices for their \"meat\" (kielbasa and the Pittsburgher), but I doubt I could get them to try it again.  But hey for only a little over $6 per sandwich, can one really complain?  Delicious!  I'll go back without 'em.  ;)  Not a lot of tables, and not even sure it's air conditioned, so don't bring your fancy clothes or your roaming toddler.  ;)",

We cleaned if off ourselves and that was okay with me.  I was pretty excited about this place because of the reviews and other personal recommendations.    I ordered a ham and cheese sandwich and my partner ordered one with more than one type of lunch meat.  The sandwiches were simply sandwiches with coleslaw and French fries on top.  There was nothing special about it and it's something easily made at home.  The price was good.  For a beer, coke, and two sandwiches we got of there for under $20.    The condition of the women's restroom was horrible.  It ruined my appetite.  You'd think with such a reputation that that condition of the restroom would be a bit nicer.  The restaurant itself was in crappy shape as well.  I expect dive bars to look like this.    Next time I'm in Pittsburgh, I won't be coming back to a Primanti Bros.  There's surely better food out there and a better dining environment.",

    "text": "I really don't know what the fuss about Primanti brothers is all about - other than their portions being big, the food was mostly tasteless.  To be fair, let me just say that my apple allergy prohibited me from partaking in their coleslaw and this could lead to my impression that they aren't all that special.  If you don't already know, Primanti Bros is known for serving up HUMONGOUS sandwiches piled high with meat, French fries and coleslaw.    I ordered their fish filet sandwich and it was just bad.  The fried fish filet was incredibly dry, the French fries were soggy and had been sitting out for a while and the vast amounts of tartar sauce I tried to dump on each bite did not do anything to help the taste.    One thing you should DEF order if you come to the Primanti Bros shop is their chili cheese fries.  They are SO incredibly good.  The cheese is thick and they are very generous with the portions and chili - cheese - fries ratio.  This helped me to enjoy my meal more.  Primanti Bros - though famous - is not the type of place you would say ... take a date.  They're not fancy and this is the type of place where you are always welcome to dress down and you cannot be scared to use your hands and just dig into a sandwich.  Plates are not provided (sandwiches comes on the wax paper that is used to wrap sandwiches), but napkins are plentiful.    I am glad to say that I experienced the famous Primanti Bros for myself, but I would not be overly enthusiastic about a return.",

I brought my family here thinking it would be a good \"Pittsburgh sandwich shop.\" My family got the Pittsburgher sandwich, which is supposed to be their #2 seller, and all of them said it tasted terrible. It looked pretty awful like a hard, dry, high school cafeteria lunch.  Some waiters are great, others will completely forget about you.  Prices are decent.  I wouldn't recommend this place.

As far as the sandwich goes, I should have gone with something with more meat, rookie mistake, and maybe a side of chili instead of chili fries. My favorite part of my sandwich had to be the coleslaw, that was on point. I'm not sure if I should have put Ketchup on my sandwich or what the hell to do with the heap of potatoes in the sandwich?

Most times, when out of towners ask for a local spot to eat, I'm one of the few that actually pushes them AWAY from this defacto Burgh tradition.  Don't get me wrong, Primanti's isn't bad, but it isn't exactly great either.  Typically I end up smothering mine in hot sauce and salt/pepper to get some flavor onto otherwise bland sandwiches.  With that said, every once in awhile, I get this odd, insatiable craving for a cap and egg sandwich (w/ onion)... and when I do cave to that temptation, it's oddly satisfying.  On the experience front, Primanti's is definitely one of a kind.  I don't know of anywhere else you can get burly bartenders to slam down a mess of a sandwich in wax paper on your table (something the suburban restaurants fail to provide).  If you're going to go, I highly suggest going either to the original in the Strip, or, if you don't feel like waiting in line during the busy times, the Market Square location.",

    "text": "I had lived outside of Pittsburgh for a couple of years and have eaten at this Primanti Brothers location four or five times. Their sandwiches were always tasty, worth the wait and the trouble of finding parking etc. So, when my parents came to visit, and we made a trip out that-a-way, I knew that would be a lunch stop. We ended up coming into Pittsburgh on Sunday around 1pm. I knew it would be crowded and anticipated having a wait. We got a table after 15 to 20 minutes and quickly sat down before someone else did. It took the waitress about 10 minutes to come and clear the previous customers remnants, which was ok.   We ordered our beers and were told that she'd come back and take our order. She came back 20 minutes later, with the beers and took our order. After that, we sat around and waited for our sandwiches for 35 minutes. When we did finally get our food, it was ice cold. The fries in the sandwich were completely soggy and cold, and the meat was barely warm. Our table ran out of napkins, and we asked for some, but they never came, finally, the table next to ours handed us a few. Maybe it was because it was cold, but the sandwiches weren't that great. I had very little meat in mine, and more coleslaw that anything else. Also, the thickness of the bread seems to have increased since I last ate here because about 60% of my sandwich was bread. We were fairly disgruntled about the whole thing, but were still going to leave a tip for the waitress.   Then, my dad went to the bar to pay. He stood there for 10 minutes, behind another customer. The server came up to them and said 'what the hell are you doing up here?', in those words!! My dad was so stunned be just stood there, the guy in line ahead of him told her that he was waiting to pay his bill, so she cashed him out and then turned around to do something else, when my dad said 'excuse me, i need to pay too', she replied to him ' Jeez, you guys are so demanding! Why the hell are you in such a hurry\". That is when their tip went straight out the door with us.   We were ok waiting for a table, we were even ok waiting for our food; it took them one hour from the time we sat down, to the time we got our food, and then the server had the audacity to behave in that manner. Either Primanti Brothers has become too big for their boots and let things slide, or they need to train their staff to be more polite and efficient. We will definitely not be coming back the next time we are in town. Our money is better spent else where.",

The waitress checked in with us, we were under some time pressure so I took the opportunity to try to pay while things were slow.  Somehow the normal queues seem to have been missed and she simply stated \"oh, you can keep the tab open, there's no rush\" and walked away leaving the card on the counter.  And boy did she mean no rush.   We finished our rounds and waited patiently, card on the counter, for the waitress to cash us out. Again, we were making our way to another event and seating was on our mind. We had arrived with plenty of time and somehow we had burned through that.   She proceeded to avoid eye-contact taking her time with numerous other activities. Attempts to catch her attention were ignored. Stood up and put on coats, two of our party leaving to grab seats. We were beginning to be late. Still no attention. I began joking about whether our waitress already picked up the tab for us and we should just go. Rain began falling and people started to stream into the location from the holiday shopping happening outside. Still couldn't get cashed out and go.   Finally I caught the attention of one of the other girls working there, who looked uncomfortable, deliberated with our waitress briefly and bluntly stated we could pay at the register. Third girl at the register seemed put-off by our intrusion and had to ask us what we had ordered, apparently a ticket wasn't available.   Finally, freedom!   I have never had to work so hard to pay a bill and leave.   I'm easy to please, minor attention, get my order to me and cash me out in a timely manner. This trip was one of the few times I've ever struggled to find a compelling reason to tip once the bill came. I plan to drop by the original Primanti Bros located later this week. Here's to hoping the service is a bit better there.",

Of course, an institution...visitors must at least try it once. Like Deep Dish pizza in Chicago or bagels in New York. You just gotta, ok? Locals seem to be split on whether its worth it...so, saddle on up to give it a shot yourself.   Sitting outside on Market Square in the sunshine (and with Batman filming in the near distance!), we embarked on my first Primanti experience. Bros is right...these are definitely NOT dainty sandwiches, by any means! DO not come here on a first date, there is literally no way to eat this beast politely.   My turkey and cheese was a \"lighter\" option, if that exists...but I will still full for the requisite 29 hours or so. Did it blow my mind? No. Did I find it fun and interesting and did it taste good? YES! Wash it down with a Diet Coke and we were set to jet to take Pittsburgh by storm the rest of the day.   Or, needed a nap.

The friend that I was meeting for dinner had no objections to eating at PB.  This location is a no frills sports bar - plasma screen TVs on the wall, beers on tap, crinkly paper menus, and seat your own self kind of place.  I ordered the Pitts-Burgher Cheese Steak sandwich ($5.99 and #2 bestseller).  It consisted of a thin burger patty, cheese, coleslaw, tomato, a thick layer of french fries all in between 2 big slices of soft french bread.    The sandwich came out on just the wrapper - no plates.  I was unsure of how to eat this sandwich that was considerably bigger than my mouth but I finished both halves in one sitting.  My friend was quite impressed by my gluttony especially for a petite person.  I highly recommend this sandwich for the portion, taste, and price.    My friend ordered and swears by the Ragin Cajun chicken breast sandwich.  According to him, it's not too spicy.  He also ordered a beer from the tap served in the biggest beer glasses I've ever seen.  If you're visiting Pittsburgh, I would suggest that you too, make PB a priority.",

I asked the waitress what was the most requested item and she said, \"You're drinking it honey.\" pointing to my Iron City pint.  Which was $2.95 by the way.  God bless the Burgh.    So the sandwich is as I remember.  Huge, but if you squeeze you can get your mouth around it.  I realized my second time around that there's a reason they can keep prices low.  There's not a whole lot of meat in the sandwich.  It's dwarfed by the coleslaw and the fries.  I'd also pass on the cheesesteak next time.  It was a square beef patty which didn't seem right and there wasn't a lot of flavor.  Would get pastrami next time for sure.    So the sandwich and decor of this location would rate 3 stars, but the concept of a restaurant that serves you an oversized sandwich with coleslaw and fries on it for  around 5 bucks rates 5, so it equals out to 4.  This sandwich and chain are one of the reasons I love the Burgh so much.",

My wife and I got the pastrami sandwich, it was good, just the same as always. Service has never been a strong suit, some things do not change.

I got it to-go so I can eat out in Market Square since it was such a great day. I learned that by getting it to-go, they wrapped the sammich so tight that it flattened the bread to nothingness (see picture I posted).   I was expecting a mayo based coleslaw, but it's vinegar based (which was better and better for you). Like others have said, the meat quantity is so small that it's a sidekick to the coleslaw and fries. I really liked the overall flavor. I just wished the meat, slaw, and fries were more in proportion to one another. (again, see picture). Having lived in NY/NJ, I'm used to the deli sandwiches where it's nothing but meat with two slices of bread. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed this piece of local PIT culture and that's what counts. For $6-8, you can't beat it when you're in Pittsburgh, esp. when y'uns warsh it down wit some Yeungling Ale.",

And at your fingertips is Pitt's pride and joy.  I'm not from here, so maybe I don't share the love. We weren't really drunk when we were eating here, and it was in the middle of the day.   The service was pretty slow, but when our order was taken, the sandwich came out very fast.  It was a good sandwich in terms of having really hot meat, and cold tomatoes and cole slaw, but I didn't think its as tasty as it could have been.  I think the bread should be buttered and toasted/grilled texas toast, and they should use seasoned fries. Use some sweet North Carolina style Cole slaw.  I came, I saw, and I conquered, but I'm giving it back. I probably won't be back ever again.",

Well when I looked at the menu and being from California I wanted to order everything off the menu . Man oh Man the prices are very generous as well as the portions . Getting started I wanted to order the classic so I did that pastrami plus Swiss double the meat !! Lady brings out sandwich with no plate hmmm ok I look around normal right . Open up sandwich and it's leaking out meat , coleslaw and French fries BOOM . I bite into the sandwich and it was tasty but a Lil dry. Suggestion try the egg on it !! I did get some extra mustard to help me out . Please don't forget your pickle it goes great with the sandwich. Good bar good when watching the games on there screens that are located everywhere you look inside. Only thing that was disappointing to me was I wanted tatortots on my sandwich instead of fries and she wasn't budging so I ordered them separate . Don't  sleep on things either .

    "text": "Solid place for a Pittsburgh sandwich. This is my favorite Primanti Brothers location, right in market square. This place has a home town  feel & is much older than your typical newer Primanti locations. This restaurant is very small with limited tables and a cafe style bar where you can order food as well. All of the servers are great & service is retry quick as well. If you're visiting Pittsburgh and want to try Primantis, you should def go here. I recommend the Capone or pastrami. Great place for a sandwich & beer or mixed drink. The sandwiches are big and the drinks are cold, which is always a plus in my book! I would recommend.",

I expected a better quality, but overall it's a decent sandwich for $7.50. I definitely liked the self check out which is very convenient. Staff were friendly and nice. I will stop by again when I crave some pastrami for sure.",

We seated ourselves and wait for a long time watching a waiter we talking to someone for a long time. Finally, she came over and we ordered hot tea and Coffee. She brought the drinks and asked if I needed sugar and cream. I said yes. She dropped off the sugar and cream. The cream looked terrible as you can see in the photos. The coffee tasted terrible, very diluted. I was hoping the food would be good. We ordered Pitts-Burger and Sirloin Steak sandwich. They tasted terrible; so bad and hit me so hard  that I even forgot to take photos. This is a place I would not revisit.",

We had a very standard meal here; sandwiches & beer. It seems like this location has a less extensive menu than some other locations which offer hoagies, pizza, and more sides, but if you're just looking for the classic sandwich you'll be good!   We definitely enjoyed our sandwiches (a pastrami and a corned beef) although our mozzarella wedges were forgotten at first as well as an extra side of coleslaw. But the staff was polite when we reminded them of the order and had the items out as quickly as they could. It was a busy night with a line out the door, so definitely hectic, but a solid place to stop for a quick meal.",

It only improves salads and sandwiches.  I had the Pitts-burger and Cheese sandwich, which is listed as the \"#2 Best Seller\" on their menu. It was served on fresh Italian bread and piled high with french fries, coleslaw, and tomato. It was really good. If I make my way back to Primanti Bros I definitely want to try some other menu items though.   I didn't order a side, since the sandwich was served with fries, but if I eat here again I'll definitely check out their tots.   I think this is an awesome spot for lunch for sure!

I got the steak and cheese - didn't really have that much steak - guess that's why its $6.99. My daughter got the traditional #2 Pittsburgher. I asked for no Cole slaw and my fries on the side. Got a funny look and remark from the waiter.  We went 2 days later after the steeler game and they ran out of wings. It reminds me of In n Out Burger on the west coast.

    "text": "This wasnt my first trip to Primanti brothers but for some reason I remember it being more special and delicious than it was. I tried the Pitts-burger and it was good but not ,\" i think ill come back tomorrow good.\" The portion is huge. I would suggest splitting it if you can! We ordered fries which was a mistake because we were so full from the sandwhich. The fries we did eat tasted burnt and werent all I wanted and more. Service wasnt friendly and people seemed annoyed we were there. I think next time I am in Pittsburgh I will try something new. The burger was just a burger you could get out of the freezer and lacked a lot of seasoning. The fries were average and under seasoned. I think they just needed to add some salt and pizazz and a smile on their face. Give it a try. I mean it was featured on diners drive in and dives so it was worth the experience to say you had been there.",

Their sandwiches arent exactly something a sane person would eat during normal hours (check the meat out...it's basically Boars Head quality). At 11-1am, this is a perfect sandwich to soak up the carbs. The sleepers are the vinegar slaw (think Montreal style) and the fresh cut fries which were quite good.

You get a large amount for a super reasonable price. But the food wasn't what i had heard bad things about. The service was very subpar. We waited for someone to even come to the hostess stand for at least 6 or 7 minutes and after being directed to the bar we proceeded to sit down and order waters which we never received until we asked 2 other people for them. We ordered our sandwiches and waited and waited and watched 3 other people who sat at the bar and ordered after us get their food. We finally got the food and it was decent. But the fact that every single employee was stomping around clearly annoyed or mad about something and the lack of customer service made it clear that I'll never come back.",

I tried really hard to be blown away by the experience but in the end it was just \"A-OK\" for me. Nothing really special about it.   First, our server was horrible and I have hard time with poor customer service. Trust me, I'm not a guy with ridiculous expectations either, I rarely (if ever) complain to a manager, etc.. Anyway, she was really preoccupied with this group of young guys who were drinking a few beers and giving her some attention. To say she was train wreck would be an understatement so I'm sure it felt good to have a couple of buzzed construction workers flirting with her BUT I don't want to suffer over her self-indulgence. Just saying.   We both ordered the pastrami sandwich and it came out rather quickly. The bread, which is made fresh daily was amazing; it literally melted in your mouth. The pastrami was just \"ehhh, ok.\" It was lean but it didn't seem to pack a real punch from a flavor standpoint. I prefer mine I little more charred up with some seasoning. I could probably go with out having the fries on my actually sandwich as well. Apparently, that's there big move; they put the fries and cole slaw on your sandwich. I was also a little bummed about the fries; they end up getting really greasy and soggy. I'm a fries \"well-done\" kind of guy so this didn't really impress me from a flavor or texture standpoint. In the end, it didn't add to the flavor of the sandwich for me; it actually made it a big soggy mess.  The portions are enormous and the price is right for lunch. Well under what I think they could charge for the amount of food they give you.   For those Pittsburgh-ians who travel to the Los Angeles area, let me recommend Langers (look it up). The place is a landmark in Los Angeles and their pastrami and corned beef is absolutely second-to-none. In a fight, it would smoke Primanit Bros. like cheap crack. Just my two cents. The neighborhood is a little sketchy though so pack some heat if you have it!",

You can either sit at table inside or outside and eat there or stand in the \"to go\" line. Since there were no tables available and we only had a few hours before the wedding, we opted to go. I ordered the italian sausage sandwich. So side note, we didn't eat the entire day, so in the moment, the sandwich hit the spot....in an okay way. I didn't think it was anything spectacular but the portion was pretty big. I did like the use of coleslaw instead of lettuce, not too keen on the fries, which is like carb overload.  So afterwards I asked myself, if I wasn't so starving, would I go back and eat a sandwich from there again? And the answer was, probably not. But you satiated my appetite, so thank you.",

I was disappointed that the salads are premade; the ones you'd buy at a super market or gas station. I mean it is a casual place, but I was at least expecting a fresh salad.

Get ready for it....deep breath...  I...don't...like...Primantis...  Gasp!  Choke!  Faint!  Yes, yes, I know.  As a born and bred Pittsburgher, I am committing blasphemy by admitting I don't like Primantis.  I don't like their sandwiches, I don't like their nachos, I don't like their soups, salads, wings or fries.  I find the whole idea of a sandwich containing 3,000 calories worth of Italian bread, cole slaw, meat, and fries just too over the top.  The fries are a soggy mess, the slaw has too much vinegar, the meats are cheap, and the bread is...well the bread is actually ok.  I know it's a Pittsburgh institution and it even served a very pragmatic purpose back in the day, but now it's just kitsch that gets the city featured on Food Network on occasion.  I've eaten there numerous times and have done my Pittsburgh duty of taking all out of towners to the (in)famous Primanti's, but always with the caveat that, \"It's not that good.\" and usually an apology afterward.  So there you have it.  I do feel like a giant weight has been lifted off of my shoulders.  I no longer have to carry around my terrible, terrible secret.",

If you're visiting Pittsburgh, it's a rite of passage of sorts to try one of these classic sandwiches. I always bring visitors here and they're usually satisfied. Meat+fries+coleslaw+Italian bread. It's not fancy food, it's not healthy food, but it's yummy food.   My favorites are the kielbasa and capicola. Also can't go wrong with the classic steak.   Pro tip: Hot sauce.  Confession: I don't like coleslaw, so I always order it without. I always get a hard time about it from staff, but they always do it anyways.  Locations other than this one in Market Square include the Strip, Oakland, South Side, any stadium, and a smattering throughout the suburbs.",

    "text": "Primanti's boasts gigantic sandwiches, topped with fries and cole slaw.  The sandwiches were definitely big enough to share, and they had a pretty good variety.  The Market Square location was very crowded on a Saturday afternoon.  We waited in line about 10 minutes to place our order, and another 25 to get our to-go sandwiches.  No one in our party had their preferences honored (no fries, cole slaw on the side, etc.)  We were a little disappointed in the service.  I had heard praises of the fresh bread, but didn't think it was anything special; by the time we got our sandwiches, it was soggy.  There was nowhere to sit, but we were fortunately able to find a table out in Market Square, which was probably better anyway because it was less crowded hectic.  As a Cleveland native, growing up with the similar restaurant, Panini's, I was excited to try Pittsburgh's version.  I was sadly disappointed.  The fries were unseasoned, and the cole slaw wasn't your typical mayonnaise base.  It was a perfectly find sandwich, just not all it was hyped up to be.",

    "text": "Visiting from New York area we decided to try the ever so famous Primantis of Pittsburgh. WTFFFF??? Is this really Phg pride? If it is, it's a sorry excuse. We went to the chain one in Market Square (not the original one on 18th in the Strip). Everyone in our party looked at each other as if to say did that just happen?!? It was god awful. Salads came packaged in plastic to-go containers wih the dressing that came from the small pouch as well. We shared fries with chili,cheese, sour cream on top which was utter crap. Some fries were still raw potatoes and the other half were too soggy. The chili on top was canned, we had a couple bites and left it because it was just too bad to stomach. When our Pitts cheese steak sandwiches came we were starving. Took one bite and it was all over from there. I don't know what the burghs idea of a cheesesteak is but apparently it's a rubbery dog food texture like beef(?) patty with legitimately a half a slice of cheese. The fries on top were soggy again and tasted as if they were once frozen but instead of warming them up in the oven, someone was too lazy and threw them in the microwave. So soggy. The sandwiches were even worse than the appetizer fries that we ended up revisiting those sloppy fries just because they all of a sudden tasted like heaven compared to these sandwiches.   Now, we are not foodies in the least. We don't follow places just because they were on tv (we didn't know primantis was on food network until someone had mentioned). We like to try new things and are not picky at all when it comes to food, but this place was simply inedible.   Here's the part which we don't get: everyone raves about it. Friends of ours who have visited the original store have said it was delicious. Fans we talked to at the pirates game have unsolicited told us how good it was. WE DONT GET IT!!!! Were we at the wrong place? Should we really try the original store? Did we order the wrong thing?? Extremely disappointed none the less as this was our first Pittsburgh experience and impression and it was HORRENDOUS!",

It's a copious amount of food for not a lot of money and Primanti compares favorably in value to most other restaurants in the Pittsburgh downtown area. Only problem I can see is the restroom is a bit dingy and down a flight of stairs, which may be difficult for those with disability.",

(My friends and I were in town for a Pirates/Phillies game, and the PNC Park Primanti Bros was packed the entire game.) We visited the Market Square location, and if you eat on the patio, it's a fun place to hang out and drink some Iron City beers.    I got the Black Angus Sandwich. It was quite large, cut in half, and brought on a piece of wax paper. As it turned out, I'm pretty sure the wax paper would have tasted better. It was really, really, not good. I did eat the first half, but the bread was so tasteless, I thought maybe it would be better if I ate the other half piece by piece. The coleslaw was OK, but the french fries were awful, and the little bit of actual meat had little taste. We had little to no contact with employees, but a cab driver told us about a young couple who dared to ask for a sandwich at another Primanti Bros without coleslaw, and were treated really rudely. Because you know, people being rude is hilarious.   So I guess if you want an authentic Pittsburgh experience then go here. But if you want actual decent food, avoid at all costs",

I walked over to the shop and took a seat at the bar. Looking up at the menu I was a bit dissapointed to see no \"cheesesteak\" but they did have the Pitts-Burgher Steak (our #2 top seller).  I ordered, and the gentleman next to me said the sandwich was good, he was from Illinois and said that he had seen the place on Diners Drive Ins and Dives.  That amped up my expectations a bit.    The waitress who was friendly mentioned that the sandwich was a mess, but that was a good thing.  But speaking of messes, the grill and fryers were filthy, but then again what else should I expect.  My sandwich arrived and it was an impressive quantity of food and utterly unique meal between bread.  There is a rectangular patty, provelone cheese, fries topped by slaw between two slices of italian bread.  The bread was great, but the rest of the sandwich was short on flavor.  The patty was just kinda a brown mass, and the fries and slaw topping the patty were just kinda there.  I found myself adding malt vinnegar to the slaw and eventually dipping in ketchup to add  some flavor.  I got out for $10, tip included.  For good price, good quantity of food, and friendly staff I give this place 3 stars, but no more because the flavor isn't there",

Anywhere from hookers to crackheads. I have been in there several times and atleast 4 or 5 times I watched someone get kicked out for doing something illegal.

    "text": "Kosher Pigswich with Dickfries and Ballzslaw!!!  Ladies and Gents, to comprehend what I am about to lay upon you I feel it's only right that I paint a picture of the womb from whence it came.   Welcome to Da Burgh, Ahhrn City --An old east coast city in Southwestern Pennsylvania, situated on the hills and valleys carved out by the Allegheny, Ohio, and Monongahela.  It rains a good deal here.  The city was built by many Eastern Europeans, some Italian, and some German immigrants who worked their asses off in the steel mills years ago.  Currently, Pittsburgh is much less blue-collar, but it still maintains much of rough blue-collar charm.  People here are genuine, love their football, beer, cigarettes (Marlboros and Camels not Parliament Lights), and facial hair (usually unkempt ones with neck beardage or the cookie duster mustaches often popular with middle-aged men with last names ending in \"ski\".)  Only out of a city such as Pittsburgh, could the Primanti Bros. Sandwich become a legendary food.  A Primanti Bros. Sandwich starts with thick slice of homemade bread, then the usual suspects of meats, cheeses, french fries are put on top, and then sweet & sour slaw is slung on top of that, and finally a tomato, and another piece of thick homemade bread.  The entire creation is plopped down flimsy piece of cooking parchment and shoved across the counter your way.  It's a huge toppling sloppy mess.  The only way to fit the damn thing in your mug is too smash it down before you bite in.  Whatever your modus operandi for eating a Primanti, there just ain't a way to eat it with dignity and still eat it right.  If you're having trouble visualizing this, check out their website. Besides their city menu has the #2 best seller indicated and yet oddly enough absolutely no mention whatsoever of the #1 or #3? <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fprimantibrothers.com&s=5192355a9729b5ae4eeaa2d514e93789f305deb2549dfe434f5ebb5e9f2cc950\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">primantibrothers.com</a>  The True yinzer sandwich option that I recommend is the Kolbassi and Cheese.  The Kolbassi is split open and dropped into the fryer.  Yes, a deep fried sausage topped with cheese, fries, and slaw.  The grease just glistening from the singed flesh as it absorbs into the thick white bread (dignity is overrated anyway). Make sure yinz warsh it dahn wit ah cold ahhrn city, en'at.  (translation: Make sure you wash it down with a cold Iron City Beer and that.)  Primanti Bros. is definitely not diet food, but most definitely a 100% genuine Pittsburgh food.  It is disgusting in all the right ways.  I leave you with the apt lyrics of South Carey. \"Where they don't pour steel, but the kids are real. But why do they all have beards (beers)? It's Pittsburgh, Go Steelers Pittsburgh.\"",

    "text": "Came here with another couple who are from here. We ordered at same time.  We sat at the counter. They got their food after 5-10 minutes. We got ours 25 minutes later.  We saw orders both dine in take out come after our order - they went out while we still waited for ours.  Sitting at the counter,  we saw what we thought was our order on the grill just frying on the there for a long time.  We asked the skinny guy with glasses who was our waiter what happened to our sandwiches- he hand gestures towards the grill and mumbles something while walking quickly away. We finally get our food after the other couple  had almost finished. Sure enough the food that had been sitting on the grill was ours - it was over cooked and burned.  I sent it back - showed the gal my burned pastrami sandwich.  Her response was that the black or burn was my pastrami.  She has an attitude and reluctantly made me a new one in 5 minutes. The ice tea tasted old and we had to wait until we got the bill to get a refill.  In watching this operation from the counter they were more interested in singing the words to piped in music than serving the customers. This staff needs some serious lessons in public relations and social skills. For the most part they were rude and inattentive.  The food was ok.  I felt bad for the other couple who brought us here - they apologized several times for the service and our bad experience.  People make or break a business- too bad a few employees can tarnish a businesses reputation- I will not recommend this place - sorry. One star - should be no star, no tip, not coming back Ever!",

This place is really connected to Pittsburgh itself and Conan even mentioned it in one of his shows as a place to eat at.  Ordered the \"2nd most popular\" item which was the cheesesteak that was very, very plain. Nothing great about the patty. The thing was HUGE and stacked with fries and coleslaw which I found didn't work well (although there are others out there that do it with success!)  You can't deviate and ask for it without the coleslaw either and their menu stated it as \"All of our sandwiches come with...\"  The portions are huge, one order can feed 2 average appetites.    The fries were the only upside of this place.  The service here is horrible.. there was 2 people running the place and our tables werent clean and it takes forever.. I don't blame it on the servers but whoever manages the place.  I don't think I will ever go back again.",

I went to Pitt for 4 years and I have to say I never understood the Primantis hype.  I dont know how you get famous for putting fries on a sandwich when the fries suck.  They are soggy and tasteless, maybe the worst I've ever had.  I will say the coleslaw is pretty good, and I'm not usually a coleslaw guy, but it doesnt make up for all the other shortcomings.    Half the sandwich falls out while your eating.  The \"cheesesteak\" might be the most tasteless sandwich ever.  You have to use a whole bottle of hot sauce just to get a little flavor.    Primantis sucks...go to Fatheads on the Southside or Uncle Sam's in Oakland.",

It may have been that my expectations were sky high due to the hype from the Food Network reviews and my friend raving about it being a must-have in town. The service was quick, and the atmosphere was very casual and cool. We ordered the burger (which I would probably decide against if I ever go back, just to try another) and the fried pickles, which were also just alright (nothing amazing). They serve the sandwich on a piece of paper (parchment paper?) instead of baskets or dishes, which was a little disappointing considering that the city seems to have quite a sustainability initiatives (more than we have in Honolulu--yay Pittsburgh). It also seemed to change my perspective on the sandwich a tad... Overall, our party had mixed reviews on their meals. If I ever make it back to the Burgh, I would give it another shot. Maybe a different sandwich and a beer the next time around to wash it all down.",

All the sandwiches come with fries and coleslaw piled on thick so don't worry about ordering more on the side (or being messy while eating, it's going to be disastrous, so stock up on napkins).

I think it is more of a novelty thing than anything. I would say yes, you should try it if you happen to come to Pittsburgh, but try not to expect a lot because that might have killed the sandwich for me.  The sandwich is packed with great meat, but the fries were pretty soggy and coleslaw that day was a bit too much pepper for my liking. I thought the fries might have been soggy because of the coleslaw so I ordered another order of fries (since I'm generally a fries fiend), but even those were soft and not up to par. I was pretty disappointed at that. However, the meat was pretty delicious. I got corned beef and it was delicious slices and it was cooked well.  I would say overall verdict: try the place but try with an open mind.",

We shared the corned beef and the salami.   The bread was fresh but so think between the bread and the fries with no salt it over powered the small amount of meet.  So sure it's a huge sandwich at a great price if you want bread with flavorless potatoes on it.  No need to go back but glad we finally tried it.   I do give the fried pickles a 5.

The food was great as I was told from several people from the area and back home.  What I was not happy with was the setting policy and service. Just to get a seat here I had to wait standing up watching people eat like a creepy stalker just to see who would get up first and finally when I got a seat no one cleaned our table for a while or even took our order cause no one even knew we had been seated. If we were bad people we could have stolen the check from the last table as they had paid with cash. Once we got a servers attention and got the table cleared and our drinks and food ordered the server forgot our drinks and when we where finally able to flag her down our food came out not even 5 minutes later. In total about a 30-40 minute wait from arrival to food. Don't even think about getting a refill I had to walk in and ask the bartender for refills for me and my family after being ignored several times. When we were done we wanted to leave but couldn't till we paid the bill and because we paid with credit card we had to wait for the server to return with our card. It took so long and with other people looking at us to get the hell up so they could sit we just walked in to retrieve the card at was just sitting on the back of the bar and had not yet been processed so I had to wait again.  Food can only get you so far, so my suggestion is if you want a good Food and can wait an hour feel free and come here. If you don't have the time just go next door to the Subway.",

However, I have to admit was I was thrilled with the idea of French fries on my sandwich, but I have to say me and everyone in my party was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the corned beef and cheese and it was huge, but also was moist and had a lot of flavor.  It was really big, but I made sure to eat it all and I would definitely eat one again if I am ever back in town.",

    "text": "I love Primanti's sandwiches. I'm a Pittsburgher and will always love their sandwiches. If you want to hear more about those, read other reviews. This one is for the service at this restaurant.  It's just bad. The servers are polite, but extremely inattentive. I'm going to go ahead and play my \"I Waited on Tables in High Volume Restaurants for Several Years\" card just so I can say that even during lunch rush, no, that level of absence is not acceptable. They take up to fifteen minutes to even greet the table, which leaves you looking around wondering who will be serving you, or if you can at least have a water. If I were serving, I'd at least pop over and say a quick, \"Hi, my name's Ali. I'll be with you in just a few minutes.\" No matter how busy you are, there are a few things you just don't let slip: greetings, drink refills, and a speedy check. If it's busy, communicate that delay by saying \"thank you for waiting,\" or \"sorry for the wait.\" Honestly that's all it takes. That's it! Primanti's servers were lacking in all of these things, and from the customer perspective, it really does make a difference in the experience. Ok, sorry for the rant, but they either need to better train the servers they have, or hire more so they aren't stretched so thin.",

As soon as we walked in the door the place was jammed back with people who were not interested in seating anyone or telling anyone they would be seated. On one side of the restaurant there were literally two girls working, and one of them was pregnant. You can imagine the chaos. I wanted to have this \"Pittsburgh\" experience that I've heard so much about but honestly I was more than underwhelmed.   After being seated, it took the waitress 10 minutes to get around to actually saying hello to us and in between that time a large group of people decided to squeeze in a booth behind our table making my friend having to get up every time a waitress or another person needed to squeeze back there.  The sandwich at best was mediocre. The coleslaw was a bit too vinegary for my tastes and became sickening after the first half of the sandwich. I needed a lot of ketchup to even finish the sandwich. Not to mention I got a nice souvenier of vinegary smelling hands afterwards.   If you're a tourist, go do it to say you had a colossal sandwich and lived the \"Pittsburgh\" experience. Apart from that, I don't know why you'd return.",

She suggested a Cajun chicken sandwich for my husband  (because he said he liked a little spice) he absolutely loved it! we washed it all down with a local IPA.

I came ahead of my party, and the guy who was hosting was kind enough to seat me without them, but the server got pretty annoyed when my friends didn't appear rather quickly.  I ordered a drink and an appetizer to stave him off of giving up my able and shuffling me to the counter, and I totally get the urgency to turn over tables as quickly as possible when a) you work for tips and b) it's a game night.  But come on, if I got seated, then take it up with the person doing the seating!  I could have done without the attitude. Anyway, I got my usual sandwich and it was just fine.  I'm starting to think that the sandwiches really are just average, and the wings and pizza actually *are* a little more impressive, but hey, I only eat a Primanti Bros sandwich a handful of times a year at most, so I always order it regardless.  Anyway, it's awwwwright.  Certainly not bad, but not blowing me away.",

    "text": "Had to visit the \"Famous\" Primanti Brother's Bar and Grill during my first visit to Pittsburgh, but most likely will only go back if my friends/family really  want to eat there.  Food:  The portions are huge, not very greasy, served nice and hot but over all very bland.  I got the Colossal Fish and Cheese sandwich.  The beer batter fish was a very large piece and by itself was not bad tasting at all (just a little under seasoned.)  The fries were limp and had no seasoning what so ever. The fries were the worse part of the sandwich.  The coleslaw was  very mild, sweet and vinegar base, and by itself it was ok, but put everything together between two slices of white bread and it made for a bland pile of flavorless starch.  The bread was also too soft and did not hold up well at all, and the cheese was nonexistent.  I ended up having to add a ton of salt, pepper and malt vinegar to my sandwich, picked it apart and ate the pieces with my fingers.  Price:  For the size of the portions you get, the price is great!  I got two sandwiches and a soda for about $16.  Their sandwiches range from around $6 - $8 each, and are a good value since you will definitely leave full (I took home left overs.)  Atmosphere:  After reading a few reviews about the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised to see that this place was not packed with tourist.  For being such a small dinner, the place was fairly empty so I was able to sit anywhere I liked (being a solo traveler, restaurants often try to stick me at the bar but I prefer to sit at a table.)  The tables were clean and organized well, and each table had a stack of paper menus to look at.  It felt like a comfy, good ol' local dinner where you can casually relax and eat.  Staff:  During my visit, the staff was great!  There was only one waitress and one cook, but both were pleasant and greeted me as soon as I walked in.  The waitress was attentive and friendly.  The cook also thanked me for patronizing there while I was leaving.  Over all, I basically came here just to say that I visited a famous Pittsburgh restaurant, but I most likely will not go there again.  If I was with friends or family who wanted to go to Primanti's I would go along, but I wouldn't go solo.  The blandness of the food is what kills it for me.  I would rather get a sandwich that is half the size with more flavor, then a huge pile of bland food.",

A colleague is a Pittsburgh native and told me Primanti Bros is a MUST - plus Ive known about this legendary place for years.  I got the steak, and while the meat was GREAT, Im just not a fan of the sandwich with the fries and the cole slaw.  The slaw is vinegar based rather than mayo based and I didnt like the taste of it.  The ambiance of this place was cool to watch the other games before we headed to Heinz Field.  I would come back to try some of the other sandwich offerings w/o the slaw & the fries.  SIDE NOTE:  The dude with the light eyes (Avery, I think) from Greys Anatomy was standing in line behind us (we were sitting at the counter) and when I realized who he was I asked if it was him.  He slowly responded and said Yes like he was trying to be undercover.  I asked if I could take a pic with him and he said after he ate - PSSSHHHHHHHHH, NOT!!!  Its not like youre Idris Elba homeboy, Im good on that.  Later at the game, I saw him on the big screen as he started the waving of the Terrible Towels.  Meh... probably not even a Steelers fan.",

Cool ambiance in market square - it was a beautiful day and being out on the patio section was outstanding.

If you had an elderly man who maybe couldn't climb the stairs, he would have a really tough time, unlike the women's room which is on the main floor. Our seating was a little tight, there were TVs which was nice for the games that were on. The atmosphere was very lively which made you feel at home- away from home, which was a plus. No complaints about our waiter, he was quick and attentive and everything he needed to be. Our food came up really quick. Their style of sandwich is probably different from what you are used to but it makes this place what it is. I definitely recommend the Founders' Favorite, which was what I got. The sandwich was SUPER yummy. It was overflowing with wonderful goodness. It wasn't messy and it was very filling and honestly I don't know how I finished the whole thing, and I eat a lot. Would return, especially to this location because of everything nearby.",

They had a limited menu when I went, which is understandable considering it was 12 and on a busy night. Got the Cajun Chicken Sandwich as a backup choice. Bit into a rock on my third bite, ran to the bathroom to make sure I hadn't broken my tooth. (Still feels not right). Told an employee behind the bar what happened, he was nice and offered to remake it, I declined asking for a refund ( understandably gunshy about biting into another sandwich). The manager was out, waited for him to return (5-10mins). When he returned he was nice but didn't really seem to know the right verbiage on how to handle this situation (coming from a manager in the service industry). Again offered to make me something else, I declined, asking for a refund, he returned with a gift card and again apologized. I'm guessing it's company policy to not issue cash refunds (or I hope so after I asked for one directly) I think that's better when a guess is dissatisfied and not when there was a foreign object in my food. But hey those 2 bites were good though.",

The original is much smaller than the other three locations that I have now been to around town, but the service was unmatched and the food was better. Tough experience to beat.   We came here after a Penguins game for dinner. It was a short and easy walk from Consol to Market Square if you haven't walked between them before. Feels quite safe too. You'll get what you're expecting here, and it is a great, lively location. We had quick and pleasant  service last night at this Market Square location, but it was quite crowded and they really pack you in. I ordered the pastrami and cheese, and I wish there would have been just a bit more pastrami on it.   I love that this location is next to many different bars and pubs, and right around the corner from the ice skating rink.",

Situated in Market Square, the restaurant looks out into the square and affords some great people watching. When we got there we got lucky and got seated right away. But we noticed that folks with bigger parties had to wait for a while. The place isn't all that big, so plan ahead if you have a larger party.  I was extremely skeptical at first because I've never had a sandwich like the kind served at Primanti. I ended up ordering the Pitts-burger Sandwich. Between to large pieces of bread, you get your meat of choice, specially-made coleslaw, tomatoes and fries. The combination is actually pretty tasty! The coleslaw gives it flavoring and the bread is thick enough to handle that much sandwich.   My one knock on this place was the atmosphere. It was VERY loud and due to the chaos our server had a tough time hearing our order (which made it so that the order came out incorrectly) and the tables are VERY close together. But in terms of experiencing some lighthearted atmosphere and good food, this is a great place.",

They're very nonchalant about their schtick (which is putting fries and slaw on your sammich, served on fresh Italian bread) but hey, if it makes you \"almost famous since 1933\" then why mess with it? I thoroughly enjoyed my Pitts-burger with Cheese! I added onions, an egg, and bacon as well as hot sauce per another review and I was so happy with my meal. The burger was almost like a slice of meatloaf, dense and delicious. I knew I would be full so I didn't get a side of fries but I think I coulda done some damage to it if I had because they were goooooood. I also got a red cream soda which ya don't see everywhere. Not sure I'd order one again even though it was tasty. I felt my teeth rotting with every sip. Looking forward to another visit in the future to try the pastrami!!",

After all, that's what friends do.  A Pitts-burger with cheese is a GIANT burger. It's a two-person burger. It's like no other burger I've ever seen. Grilled sourdough bread, a giant thick hamburger patty (at least 8oz), fries, cheese and tangy coleslaw. It was also delicious, drippy and worthy of being on a tv show.  I could only eat half - really wished the husband had made this trip with me to split this. They serve it on waxed paper and will bring more waxed paper for you to wrap it up to go.  I washed the half burger down with a Yuengling, large size. That was a mistake. One, the large is like drinking 2.5 beers. Two, I learned Yuengling (for all it's fame) tastes alarmingly like Miller Lite. Live and learn, friends.  All in all, I would go back here for the atmosphere and another Pitts-burger. I'd just take my husband or a friend to split the burger. And while there, I would order any other type of local beer to try but never Yuengling again.",

    "text": "When in Rome, right? For my first trip to Pittsburgh, I had one absolute must on my list: Primanti Bros!   Before this, my only experience with Primanti Bros has been at home in Charlotte. We always have at least one night at someone's house during the NHL Playoffs (GO PENS!) where my Pittsburgh friends make a homemade version.   I walked over around 11:30am on a Saturday from the Kimpton. It wasn't too packed. I found a spot at the bar and ordered a Woodchuck (I mean, it's kind of like having apple juice for breakfast, right?). I ordered a Capicola and Cheese. It was perfect. And monstrous. There's no pretty way to eat this and that's fine. The way it should be. I'm not a slaw person, but I do like a good vinegar based one like this.   I loved sitting at the bar and watching all the action at the grill. It's crazy to see just how many fries they can go through.  Primanti Bros, you were worth the wait. This is a definite stop for anyone visiting Pittsburgh. My only regret is that I didn't order a big kosher pickle (rookie move on my part).",

The sandwich was terrible. I get that the fries and slaw on the sandwich are their thing, but it was inches of fries and some slaw, with the tiniest slices of meat. Not worth it.

That guy was such a fucking dick, didn't give us what we ordered, and treated us like we were a problem being there. I didn't finish my gross food, not even half of it. I'm pretty sure it wasn't even meat but gross cardboard. It was so hot in there, it was not fun. Warm beers. It wasn't clean, and smelled like actual shit. I slipped on the gross wet floor twice, almost broke my ass. ...Yes, we paid for our food and drinks because we're not dicks, and left without saying a word because honestly we understood it wouldn't be worth saying it. I'm sorry, I really only like writing good reviews, but it's bad guys. Never again. No ty. Good luck if you go. And it's so stupid because we like The Square.",

    "text": "I was given no forewarning except a cryptic \"you don't know what you're in for\" by our Uber driver upon dropping us off in front of the German Market. I looked to Sir Sneaky who merely wore a smirk on his face and had an extra hop in his step as he led me to the end of the line that spanned the length of the restaurant. It was raining steadily. But my hooded waterproof jacket and the expectant faces of our fellow soon-to-be patrons kept me smiling.   I was told the sandwiches were unique and given the opportunity to briefly scan the menu. I saw a few options and was content. As we inched closer to the door, I noticed the hype over their fries. I love fries. I also love pickles. They have huge pickles! With that, I was already in heaven. I then realized the sandwiches are loaded with fries and pickles (and unfortunately The Devil's own concoction, Cole Slaw.) I'm sure I could have blasphemed and ordered a sandwich sans Cole Slaw, but I didn't have the appetite for a giant sandwich. So I happily ordered fries and a pickle while Sir Sneaky ordered a triple meat sandwich that he said tasted entirely of ham and potatoes. I think that was a good thing??  Meanwhile, I ordered one Kentucky mule to his two beers. We sat, drank and chatted until our food came. We then continued drinking, chatting and sitting while eating the scrumptious food. My only regret was not being hungry enough for a sandwich. I'm looking forward to our next visit so I can partake in what clearly was a feast of the senses given the many smiles and messy hands inside the restaurant.   The place is no-frills (no silverware, no plates) and ideal for walking in off the street to warm yourself from the inside out.",

It's a VERY no frills (I'm talking no plates and paper food court cups) sports bar with plenty of patio seating. It appears you can park on Market street right outside the place but I walked down my hotel. Anyway I downloaded the app and got a coupon for a free sandwich with purchase of a drink ($3). I got the ragin Cajun and it was soooo good. I mean it comes with fries on it, and enough fries that you can skip a side of them. I almost asked for no cole slaw bc I hate the southern version that's essentially mayonnaise soup but I wanted the full experience so I left it on and I'm glad I did. It's not really cole slaw, more like the very first stage of sauerkraut (which I also don't like but for some reason this stuff was GOOD). Service leaves a bit to be desired but the food is enough for me to want to come back. Side note: bathroom was very clean.",

Just coleslaw and fries on a sandwich, what's the big deal?  Sometimes the simple things really are the best.  Now I have a reason to go back to Pittsburg!",

I ordered the corned beef and cheese sandwich and the bf ordered the roast beef and cheese sandwich. It comes with cole slaw, tomatoes and fries in the sandwich! It is THE most IMPOSSIBLE sandwich to eat but it was damn good!! I was glad that we decided to choose Primanti for lunch. Plus knowing that Anthony Bourdain had tried it, it makes it more well worth trying!  If I ever happen to be in Pittsburgh again, I'd definitely try the cheesesteak or the Capicola sandwich. OOH or the ragin cajun chicken sandwich.. MMMM....",

I probably have them once a year b/c someone from out of town wants to go there.    Sometimes I forget how much I don't like the sandwiches until that one time a year.  Sorta how you perceive the Holidays to be this joyous time and then reality hits you and realize that's it's completely overrated.  I usually get the Cappicola and Cheese sandwich and it's alot of salty meat, with some bland fries, mild cole slaw, cheese completely hidden by the other ingredients between two slices of bread.  Maybe Primanti's should make up a secret sauce b/c it's always so damn dry.    I think I need to learn my lesson and stop going there.  I would have given it 2 stars but it seems like such a Pittsburgh staple that I didn't have the heart to dock them any stars.  See, this Pittsburgh girl still gives props to her roots!",

It seemed less like a distinguishing gimmick, and more like a move to avoid giving you a plate.  It was just easier throw everything in the sandwich, wrap it up and give it to you.... and it caught on.  Now it's a big deal, I guess.   But, I'm not trying to be negative here.  Bottom line is that I enjoyed my pastrami sandwich.  If I ever go again, I think I'd throw a fried egg on there too.  It seems like the perfect place to grab a quick sandwich before heading to a game.  If I lived here, I'd probably develop an unhealthy obsession with this place, and come here way more often than my cardiologist would want me to.  Recommend.",

I finished it so quickly because there wasn't much to it.   Primanti Bros is packed this 4th of July. There is a line out the door for takeout and you need to stand over tables like vultures for a chance at a seat yourself table. Employees are constantly making this announcement about the takeout and table service. It would be wise to put up a sign.  They are significantly understaffed and our poor server is running around like a headless chicken. That's still no excuse for trying to memorize our order and not writing it down. The order for our group of four was so horribly botched. Cheese was added where it was held off, eggs were forgotten, tomato and slaw were held off where they should have been included. One order was completely sent back to be redone and two needed additions. Three out of four if us received waters initially but I didn't receive mine until he came back with the corrected sandwich. I also ordered a pickle that never came.  Oh and the sandwich. I initially thought they held back my meat and cheese. The meat was so thin that I basically had a fry sandwich. I wish I knew the slaw wasn't mayo based or I would have tried it. In any case, it did not live up to the legendary expectations.     I'd have to say I'm pretty disappointed with my experience.",

    "text": "I went here because Thrillist said I had to have it while in Pittsburgh.  I got the colossal fish sandwich, fried pickles, and smallman fries (i think thats what they were called).  The pickles tasted good (briny and slighlty spicy), but the texture was off. The spears were not crunchy at all, so a bite just pulls the entire spear out of the batter.  Smallman fries were a bargain. Theyre chili cheese fries with bacon and fresh jalepenos. You get enough to hate yourself for less than 6 bucks. This can easily be shared. However, i found that the whole thing gets overwhelmed by the amount of chili, and the chili is a bit on the sweeter side so thats not how i want my fries to taste.  Now the sandwich. I guess the sandwiches are tomatoes, fries, cheese, and cole slaw plus a meat source between two thick slices of italian bread.  The bread is pretty good. It's soft, somewhat dense white bread with a hearty but not hard crust. The fries taste like handcut fries. Theyre soft and brown with little to no salt. The cole slaw is the kind i like: no mayonnaise. It tastes like the mayonnaisy kind of cole slaw without the mayo itself. The fish is sliced kind of thin (but its still a big piece of fish) and its in a crispy batter.  My overall impression of the sandwich was dry and kind of bland. The sandwich doesnt have any sauce in it; the only good source of moisture is the tomato and cole slaw. If the cole slwa wasnt a third of the sandwich's volume, it would be too dry. I couldnt taste the cheese at all; i wouldnt be surprised if they simply forgot to add any. There werent any elements of the sandwich with a dominant flavor, and the ketchup and hot sauce at the table make the sandwich taste worst.  Despite the food not being good (in my opinion), i had a fun time. Its a great place to go with a group and watch a game on tv, and it has a Hooters-like atmosphere minus the degradation of women.  With the great atmosphere but mediocre food, i found this place to be very average. However, the internet makes this place sound like an important place to try in Pittsburgh. Give it a shot of youre in town and looking for something casual and not too adventurous.",

The food itself though has started to taste a bit bland though the bread itself comes from another Pittsburgh icon, Mancini's.  One cool thing- you don't get plates. Food is served on deli paper. Weird, but easy cleanup. Worth checking out, but I'm not sure if it's as good as it used to be :(.",

My wife and I had never heard of this place before coming to Pittsburgh, but several local people told us it was one of those \"must do\" Pittsburgh stops.  Even though the place was packed, we had a real friendly server who took the time out to tell us the history of the chain and explain the food options. We got a couple great sandwiches and some chili cheese fries (my wife got a vegetarian Deluxe Double Egg & Cheese and I got a Capicola with Cheese and an added egg at the suggestion of the waiter).    The sandwiches come standard with a vinegary type of coleslaw (not creamy - almost like a fresh mild sauerkraut) and french fries inside, along with whatever else listed.  It was like nothing I have ever had, but after an initial bite or two trying to figure the flavors out, I dove into the sandwich headlong and loved it!  Doubt I will have anything like it anywhere else, it will always be etched in my mind as a part of Pittsburgh - though I hear they are expanding all over the place!",

    "text": "I claim to be no expert of sandwiches, but Primanti Bros was highly recommended by a colleague as I was down in Pittsburgh for work. When you walk in you get the \"hole in the wall\" vibe. Not the worse hole in the wall, and I've been to plenty. So I felt quite at home sitting down to eat. FYI - my rating is more so a 3.65  For appetizers we ordered the honey buffalo wings and the spicy tator tots. I will say this, the honey buffalo wings lived up to their name. You take a bite and you taste the honey, then the back end of the bite you get the buffalo. I was pleasantly pleased that they were able to accurately get that taste and we enjoyed every bite of those wings. The tator tots were your regular fare. Cheesy, spicy goodness fried to perfection. I couldn't eat the entire serving because it was definitely after 10 pm when we arrived and I did not want to suffer from acid reflux when I got back to our hotel.   For my main sandwich I ordered the Reuben. I believe it had pastrami and corned beef with slaw, fries and some sort of cheese on rye. This was pretty good too. They provided a garlic mayo that I thought was a pretty good addition to the sandwich. And we tried a local beer (IC lite) which I found was just ok due to a taste on the back end I'm still trying to figure out.   Overall, I think Primanti Bros makes a decent sandwich and I'd stop by again if passing through Pittsburgh again.",

I don't know why the reviews are so mediocre for this place, but I thought this was a great location-- pretty small but they didn't have a long wait on a busy Friday night downtown. The service was quick and the waiter was super friendly.  The standard Primanti's menu you can get at any of their locations.    I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich and you get a really large chicken breast on the sandwich.  I do recommend you leave the coleslaw on the sandwich even if you aren't a huge fan of coleslaw, just because this is really the only moisture on the sandwich since they don't use any mayo, mustard, etc.  Is this the BEST sandwich I've ever had in my life? No. Is it an outstanding sandwich that I'd eat every day? Still no.  But it's satisfying on occasion & it does the job.  You won't be blown away by a culinary masterpiece by any means but if you're looking for a greasy, hearty, get-you-through-the-night kind of meal, this is your sandwich!  A great place to stop if you're passing through town or if you're just super hungry and need a good standby meal. Filling, tasty, and super cheap!",

I was thrilled to see the outdoor seating and was ready to settle in for some meats and beer!  Basically - the experience was meh. I had never had a Primanti sandwich and figured *when in Rome* since we only had ~6 hours total to enjoy the city. We split the Carnegie sandwich and it was just fine.  The fries that come on the sandwich were soggy and didn't really add much other than making the sandwich essentially un-biteable. I think there's a lot better sandwiches to be had in Pittsburgh that don't come from a chain and I look forward to trying them on my next visit!  What made the experience a True three star was the less than stellar service. Our server told us from the get go that he was about to leave, and continually questioned our order choices. The on tap list was out of date, so each time we went to order a beer they were \"out\". Our server acted annoyed as though us not having a proper draft list was somehow our fault? Never mind the fact that I might recommend skipping alcohol all together here - $9 for a Blue Moon felt high to me. I'm not sure if it's just this location or if this is the vibe throughout the chain, but I likely will skip out for some of the local sammy options the next time I'm in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "We had heard that this was the place to go for some historic Pittsburgh goodness even before arriving in town. But when our walking tour guide told us a little more about how the \"almost famous\" Primanti Bros sandwiches came about, we definitely wanted to check them out for ourselves. We were told that the original location in the Strip District, home to mills and factories, wanted to make it easier for the local truck drivers to grab their lunch on the go, so the fries and coleslaw became part of the sandwiches. I don't know if that story is actually True, but it was good enough for us!  The outside dining area of the Market Square location makes for good people watching. Our server was prompt and courteous. My daughter and I both ended up having the Cheese Combo - Swiss, American, and Provolone ($6.69) while my husband went with the Kielbasa & Cheese ($6.99) and my son went with the Pitts-burger & Cheese ($7.49). They all were served simply on paper - not plates (which helped to make the \"story\" seem even more believable). They are very messy to eat but all of us were happy with our meals!   We are happy we had a chance to check out a piece of Pittsburgh history! We would definitely go again should we come to town - the sandwiches are unique, tasty and reasonably priced.",

    "text": "My friend and I came here after being told at Home-Depot that Primanti's is a right of passage for all those who move to Pittsburgh. To preface this review - from the way everyone hyped up Primanti's I was expecting some sort of heaven on a plate. To say my expectations were way too high for a semi-fast food bar is an understatement.   The staff is truly amazing. We had to wait less than 2 minutes before someone greeted us at the front door and told us to sit anywhere. Our server appeared after a few short minutes. It would be easy to assume that the short wait time was due to it being Wednesday evening but the place was surprisingly busy so I would like to contribute the fast service on our great server. She was extremely patient and helped us with our menu selection.   The food was not exceptional but also not bad. I was a little disappointed with my Pitts-burger because even with the coleslaw, it was very dry. The wings and cheese fries, on the other hand, were really tasty and I would definitely be coming back just for these.   Overall, if you are not from Pittsburgh, Primanti's is worth visiting just to check off the tourist attraction checkbox but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here now that I'm a local.",

Not as loaded with steak as I thought it would be, but a ton of fries and a scoop of coleslaw. Easy sandwich to share as it comes out on wax paper and is sliced in half. If you're a light eater definitely split one! The service is basic but everyone is super friendly. The place is bustling and the servers work hard, a nice tip is well deserved. I had ice tea but they have plenty of beers on tap and I believe a full bar. A must try while here in Pittsburgh and you will see people lined up to get in. I gave them a 3 star only because the bar where I was seated was quite a mess and no pickle with the sandwich which was shocking to me!",

I settled for the Angus sirloin and cheese topped with tomatoes, cabbage, and French fries.  I was impressed by the size of the sandwich however, the overall taste was just OK.    Unfortunately the sandwich just did not live up to the hype the locals gave it.  Maybe my sandwich wasn't made but love because I'm an outsider, maybe my tastes are not the same as an east coaster...not sure.  I would be willing to try it again if I pass through another time just to see.  Being from the Southwest I think we expect a little bit more flavor add a minimum at least some salt and pepper.",

    "text": "For most people, the first stop on any tour of Pittsburgh's food scene is Primanti's, a small regional restaurant chain born in the Great Depression known for their over-stuffed sandwiches consisting of thick Italian loaf slices, deli meats, melted cheese, cole slaw, and French fries. The original thinking behind this iconic sandwich was to give on-the-go truckers an all-inclusive hand-held meal by implanting the fries and the slaw into the sandwich itself.  My Primanti's order is typically \"capicola with a fried runny egg,\" and then I pour LOTS of Trappey's Red Devil Cayenne Sauce directly into the cole slaw in the sandwich. Without the hot sauce, the sandwich doesn't have enough acid for my taste since the cole slaw is not assertively flavored. Also, the ratio of meat-to-everything-else is low, so the egg helps add some protein without disrupting the salt balance.   There's no great way to eat these without making a bit of a mess, and there's perhaps no food more beloved by Pittsburgh than these messy monstrosities. Despite my personally not being able to understand what the big deal is, I've had a dozen or so Primanti's sandwiches during my infrequent visits to the city. I finish each one thinking, \"that was pretty good, but not as good as people think.\" But then I find myself back in a Primanti's again the next day and inexplicably ordering another, only to then want to dismiss it for not being the best thing I ever ate, while still devouring every last crumb.  Food/Decor/Service: 3.9/3.5/3.1  What To Order: Capicola Sandwich or Pitts-Burger, both of which should be ordered with fried egg and then be subjected to lots of Trappey's Red Devil Cayenne Sauce",

    "text": "No, just no. I do not understand what all the hype is about. I was so excited to try this and review it based on the hype we got about needing to try it. My husband and I are in Pittsburgh for a long weekend from Columbus, Ohio - and Primanti Bros is a spot some friends and all the locals were all recommending. We decided to save this spot for our last day and last lunch due to all the hype.   I will say that this location is really nice and they have a beautiful patio - so that gets them one star. The inside is well decorated and feels like a fun city hang.   What gets them another star is the service - we got our seats, menus, drinks, food, and check very promptly - so this gets them another star.  Now let me get onto the food and they get ZERO stars from me for food. I got the Pitts-Burger, which is the #2 best seller by the way, and it was DISGUSTING. When it came out it looked promising and everything I expected it to look like. I was excited to dig in but a bit overwhelmed by the size - which is fine as I expected that.   All sandwiches are topped with slaw, fries, and a tomato. I thought it was weird not to have any sauce but I figured the meat spices and bread butter/spices would be enough. NO. My first bite was dry bland white bread and an overwhelming amount of cole slaw - the cole slaw didn't even taste like slaw. It had ZERO slaw flavor and honestly tasted more like sauerkraut. I immediately removed mine (and so did my husband after his first bite). I was excited to actually be able to get a bite of the burger the second bite from removing the slaw. The second bite I got fries and the burger - I can't even begin to describe to you how absolutely disgusting the burger was when I bit into it. There's no way it's real beef - I'm not kidding when I say I would prefer McDonald's beef over this sandwich. The beef was SO GROSS. It was not seasoned, not even with salt or pepper. Also the consistency reminded me of wet dog food packed into a patty.  I immediately took it out of my mouth and removed the whole thing. I know it's gross, but see pic attached for what I'm taking about. It doesn't even LOOK like hamburger meat. I added some ketchup and gave it a third bite and no - it didn't even help at all.   So after this all I had left on my sandwich was the dry bland bread with no sauce and French fries and a little bit of cheese. I will say the fries are fine - thank god my husband and I got the loaded fries to share otherwise I would have been starving due to three terrible bites I had of my sandwich. I didn't touch the other half or the sandwich and threw it away.   My husband got the roast beef sandwich and he said it was just ok, but he did finish it and said it didn't taste gross. But he also said it was very bland - no spices or sauces.   I do not understand the hype on this. Honestly steak and shake or McDonald's has this place beat by far.  I would MAYBE go back and try the chicken tender basket or the boneless wings - but never the sandwich. They seriously need to work on quality and seasoning.  If you are an out of towner, do not waste your money. If you want a good burger or sandwich in this area, choose somewhere else.",

    "text": "Great location on the Market Square, with late hours for post ice-skating delicacies.  If you can call a Primanti sandwich a delicacy that is. And yes, I will.  I enjoy myself a good primanti sandwich complete with unnecessary carbs loaded onto it in the form of french fries.  I took a student here on a Wednesday evening, and it was a hockey night.  The Pens were away, and the game was on tv, so what better way to experience Pittsburgh than by going to Primanti Bros?   I ordered a reuben with a pickle.  The pickle was great.  Man do I miss pickles.  I ate that whole thing and enjoyed every juicy sour bite. The Reuben was very good too... the meat is a little thicker than standard deli pastrami, and I will admit that I think there was too little kraut... but the taste can't be beat.  I'm drooling over it just thinking about it now.    We sat out on the enclosed patio which despite the chilly night, was relatively warm.  I did wear my coat the entire time though... so maybe it isn't the perfect place for a date, but our choices were limited because the place was hoppin!  Service was great.  I don't remember our server's name, but he was polite, efficient, and not too involved.  Just the way I like it.  This is also a great location if you're in town visiting, especially during the holiday season.  The holiday market is right there, and over at PPG square, the ice rink offers evening fun for the whole family.  I was happy it was so close so that we could ease our hunger pangs after the physical trial that was ice skating!",

I was also scared; scared it would let me down, like another sandwich place with the same concept in Chicago that was gross.  And well: Primanti Bros is better. It was delicious. I had the pastrami and it was wonderful and had nice crispy edges from being fried on the grill. The bread was soft and easy to bite through and the coleslaw was perfection. Coleslaw is my least favorite, unless it's vinegar based and this was vinegar based. It wasn't too vinegar-y and I could tell there was a little something sweet in it. All in all, it paired well with the rest of the sandwich. The fries were crisp and not at all soggy as well. It was marvelous and I could've eaten another one.  Except that I had two huge yuenglings because I was in pennsylvania. you can't get it here, ok?  Also, the guy working the day we went here was SPECTACULAR. Seriously, it was kind of crowded when we got there, then super crowded and he got everybody out within twenty minutes. That's service.",

So anyways, we came in around 4pm on a saturday afternoon and though it was full, there was no line. We were seated almost immediately. The menu says \"pittsburger cheesesteak\": is the second best.  Dont ask them whats #1 since they will always say \"what you order is\". Okay! that doesnot help! So we ordered the colossal fish, pastrami, double egg & cheesesteak.  HUGE portion sizes. I could barely finish one half of the s/w. LOVED the pastrami. The others were just okay. Infact I didnt like the cheesesteak much. Yumm fries, but they get mushy sandwiched with the coleslaw.  The coleslaw has no mayo - its vinegar based, but delish!

Maybe it was because it was late (11:00 pm), or maybe because we didn't seem like a table that was going to make anyone a lot of money, but we were underwhelmed by the quality of the food and the service.  The stack of bologna, on the Jumbo and cheese, was fried on the outer 2 most slices, and cold in the middle, as were the fries.  I did like the vinegary (not mayonnaise-y) coleslaw, had plenty of black pepper, and the sandwich had plenty of volume.  Can't say I'd recommend them, might try again one day at either a more popular location, or closer to a standard meal time.",

I went around 4 pm on a Saturday and it was pretty busy! Usually a good sign. There were only about 3 people in front of me in the takeout line, so it shouldn't have taken long for me to place an order, right? Wrong. It took maybe 15-20 minutes for those 3 orders to be taken because nobody would commit themselves to working the register. While waiting in line, I got to see all these mouthwatering sandwiches being made. Once I placed my order, it didn't take long to come out...  So I got a Pittsburgh cheese steak, their #2 most popular item (don't ask what their #1 is...the guy will roll his eyes and unenthusiastically say, \"beer.\") Long story short, what I ended up with was a bland, lukewarm beef party with bland soggy fries on top. The cold lettuce and tomato cooled the sandwich even more. I enjoyed the coleslaw on top, which is pretty much all I ended up eating from the sandwich. And a few limp fries. Disappointing.",

I now wish I'd skipped the crab shack and tried these hot off the grill, because the hot pastrami and corned beef were awesome at 1.5hours later in airport, and 4 hours later in ANOTHER airport.  Sure they got a little soggy and the fries were mush, but it was still good, which means I missed out on something by not getting it fresh.    Live and learn, now my generally animal fat free belly has something to look forward to if I ever get to Pittsburgh again.  I wish I had realized they were serving these at the Pirates Park.

Bread not toasted, burger tasted a lot like my morning star black bean burger that I get frozen.  Coleslaw was a lot better with the hot sauce I smothered on it.  The best part was by far the fries which weren't all that great.  I am glad that those were home made.  I picked all the bread off ate mostly the fries and was not very impressed.  The beer makes everything tastes better so order at least two beers before eating.  I'm not a big foodie but I like my food taste better.  I still ate because I was hungry and it's not uneatable, just bland and kinda of boring.  It's still a must do in Pitts so go ahead and do it at least once, but skip the rest of your stay.",

They don't make the bread themselves. It tastes just like two slices of Wonderbread stacked on top of one another. And the fries are starchy and limp.   Limp fries between jumbo slices of Wonderbread. They have some real nerve calling this a \"sandwhich\".

Overall, food is good for a... well, for a sandwich shop... But in the end, I didn't leave with a sense that I really had to come back.   The real novelty at Primanti Brothers is that all of there sandwiches include french fries and cole slaw inside that sandwich. And to that I say... \"who cares\".  I personally didn't care for the fries and slaw inside my sandwich, but I am also not a huge french fry or cole slaw fan. (I like the good ones, but I can easily pass on average,) I will say that their cole slaw, which was vinegar rather than mayonnaise based, was quite good. And there fries were above average, but not as good as somewhere like say, Five Guys.   The ingredients in the sandwich were all pretty good. I had the Pastrami and my friend had the Angus steak. The bread, meat, cheese, etc., were all good quality and were distinct when tasted individually. The sandwiches also seemed to work OK as a package, but for some reason for me--aside from the novelty factor--they didn't stand out. I think that maybe with the fries and slaw in there, there is just too much going on and those two tend to dominate the whole sandwich. It really takes over and you hardly taste the quality of the other ingredients.   On the plus side, the sandwiches average about $7 each, and for that price, your get a pretty decent sandwich. In the end, Primanti Brothers is a definite must try if you are passing through, but I don't see myself craving these babies any time soon.",

The sandwiches are large and the pricing is fine ($6-$9), but what you get is a sloppy sandwich with food service-grade meat topped with lukewarm fries. Good in theory, bland in execution; it's a lot of calories without the accompanying flavor.  We also had terrible service at the Market Square location; I'll chalk this up to a fluke. The patio seating at the Market Square location is wonderful on a sunny day, but it started to rain and they actually retracted the awning, explaining that it wasn't designed to get wet --but apparently their customers are.  The legacy and infamy might tempt you to eat here, but take your money elsewhere and buy good-tasting food instead of kitsch.",

I can see it being bringing back memories of college days to any alumni.  +friendly service. It was day 2 of our cashier/ waitress and I thought she was pretty amazing.  +fries are delicious in general, and this place is no exception.  +cheap. 6 bucks for a sandwich or burger. You're not in San Francisco anymore.  +coke products and not pepsi. Win.   -I just don't eat this type of food if I can help it. White bread, well done cheap meat.  -Fried everything.   So, if you would like a burger with fries, on white bread and are not looking to see a green thing in sight, this is the perfect place and you won't be disappointed. If you are a college student, you should eat here at least 1X per month, if not more.",

And I think there may have been salads and some other stuf fon the menu... but really, it's all about the almost famous sandwiches!!  The sandwiches come with fries and coleslaw (vinegar based not mayo based!!). No, not on the side, but on the sandwich. And as weird as it may sounds, it tastes really good that way!   I didn't get anything to wild, just a turkey sandwich. The bread was fantastic, soft but still sturdy, and there was plenty of turkey. The fries could have been crispier, but they weren't limp and soggy so I can't complain too much there! My husband had a bowl of soup in addition to his sandwich and I stole a taste... Very flavorful!   Service is where a star is lost... We had to flag someone down to get my water refilled and my mother-in-law had to ask for tartar sauce for her fish sandwich twice. Our waiter was friendly and took decent care of us other then those 2 minor hiccups.   I can definitely see why these sandwiches have the following that they do. I can see myself going back next time my travels take me to Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "Subway calls their line folks \"sandwich artists.\"  If those people are considered artists, then the cooks at Primanti Bros are friggin' Picasso.   If you've never sat by the grill, you should, just to see them in action.  On a busy lunch day, it's not uncommon for them to have 15 things going at once, and they keep track of what's what via...broken french fries.  I've never seen or heard them get anything wrong, either!  While I wouldn't call them chefs, as the menu at the end of the day is simple, they definitely have a solid skill set at the griddle.  If you've never been to Primaniti's, here are a few tips from a seasoned veteran.   Tip 1:  Always get fried egg.  Always.  On everything.   Tip 2:  Pick up a bottle of hot sauce and sploosh it on the fries...those of you complaining about bland fries definitely need to try the hot sauce technique, as it makes a definite difference.   Tip 3: The \"cheesesteak\" sucks and is a travesty that people are encouraged to order this abomination, as compared to many other items of deliciousness on the menu.  Tip 4: I'm a  big fan of capicola (with egg) and the colossal fish.  The fish is huge, and you will feel like a fat kid if you finish it.   Tip 5: A 23oz  \"Iron\" is only like $4.  Get one and talk like a Yinzer for a complete experience.  The Market Square location is just as good as the original in the Strip.  Oakland is meh, Southside comes up third in my book.  I haven't been to others.  If you're coming in from out of town though, any of them will fit the ill.",

I've never heard of any place serving ginger ale in a cup, bottle or can in Texas, but here it seems to be everywhere!  Every place we stopped to eat and even a few bars recommended I try their ginger ale and it's really good!  So we all got that to drink.    To start we tried the chili since it was posted on the wall as great chili.  A few friends told me \"don't get the chili, you're there for a sandwich.\"  They were right.  The chili wasn't good.  We don't put beans in chili here, and it should be thick, meaty, and able to eat through a spoon.  This stuff was weak, watery and full of beans and maybe some other vegetables.  Our chili would make people in Pittsburgh fall over dead.  I got a double sweet and hot sausage sandwich, the wife had the Philly, and the kids had corned beef and a ham.  We had seen the hundreds of TV shows about this place and we were finally here to see if the mix of coleslaw, fries and meat was really as awesome as they say it is.   They were right.   The sandwiches didn't seem as big as they were on TV but they were freakin' awesome.  We all enjoyed these sandwiches more than any sandwich we had ever had before.   We had just had a long day of eating tons of bacon and bacon booze, so I didn't think any of us would be able to finish a big sandwich.  WE DID.  It was soooo good.    The only bad part about coming to Pittsburgh and visiting Primanti Bros is that we had to go back home the next day!",

No offense but this place isn't good enough for me to put up with waiters who are mad at the world and/or their life...go find a deli with awesome an awesome Reuben and then we can talk.

The pickles were 5 star deliciousness! I just loved them, and may have pushed my dad out of the way to claim the last as my own. The sandwiches were yummy too! I loved the kielbasa itself, but had to hunt to find the promised cheese. The coleslaw is really excellent - tangy and light, and I personally like it a lot on the sandwich itself. The fries were less excellent. I don't know if they would have been better on the side rather than on the sandwich, but they were kind of cold, soggy, and unsalted. Didn't stop me from eating them, though. I think that if the fries were better, this would be a 4 star establishment.",

When you add potatoes to a sandwich it tends to make it taste bland unless you have a killer sauce.  The sandwich could feed most people for two meals and it's only $7..great value.  23 oz miller lite was only $4..also so cheap.  We enjoyed sitting at the bar and watching the head cook make quick work of 100+ sandwiches.  These people got the routine down pat.

    "text": "I found myself in Pittsburgh one Sunday morning while pursuing the baseball parks of America, and a little bit of preemptive research made it unavoidable to visit Pittsburgh and NOT have a Primanti Bros. sandwich.  When I arrived into the city, I parked my car and made my way to Market Square location, where I was told that it was also where a few scenes of She's Out of My League was filmed, (which by the way, I enjoyed that movie since it so closely hit home to a dork like me), but upon arrival, I was mortified to see nothing but construction equipment and chain link fences.  But anyway, I go into Primanti's, and I'm bombarded by Pittsburgh sports - this does not bother me, but the sheer magnitude was a bit unexpected.  The wall of Clemente, Steel Curtain photos, and my personal favorite, the shoe-string tackle of Nick Harper, which I find amusing to be considered one of the greatest plays in Pittsburgh sports apparently.  The rest of the establishment is clean and well-traveled appearing, and lots of high-def televisions satiates the sports-lover's attention whilst waiting on food.  So being the tourist that I am, I don't really know what to get, so I ask the waitress of \"what is THE food for a tourist like me?\"  With a confident smirk, she simply says \"pastrami,\" and I thank her for the suggestion, and I realize that it wasn't so much \"a suggestion\" as it was \"the order,\" and five minutes later, this monstrosity on a baking sheet is presented to me.  Thin-sliced pastrami, cole slaw, tomato, and I think there was some cheese in there, but a fistful of fries as well - you guys know the drill.  So in conclusion, great success.  I thought the pastrami sandwich was the stuff of legend, and just thinking about it has me kind of craving one again, even after lunch.  In fact, the best part of this particular trip to Pittsburgh was Primanti Bros., because my Braves ended up sending out the D-team, who naturally failed to beat a mediocre Pirates squad.  But the food was good, and that's what's the most important.",

Maybe it's just the fact that we went to the market Square location, but I won't go out of my way for this place again. Also, the so-called \"fresh\" Italian bread isn't so fresh. The end",

They don't take your entire order they only take your drink order and then your good order. It took 10 minutes to get our drink order. After finally getting our drinks she waited another ten minutes to come get our food. When we ordered our food when I asked for light coleslaw she said they can't do that and for me to just take it off. She explained that they just put fistfuls on it. So why can't they just put less fistfuls on it?   Our waitress was very rude and didn't make me feel welcomed at all. She never introduced herself and just treated us like animals.   I would never tell anybody to go to the Primanti Brothers again downtown. The one in Oakland is so much nicer and better quality.   It's really bad management to have only two people serving outside when there are over 20 tables. It's not fair for the customers or for the servers.   While the food was good as always it wasn't worth the wait because it just took to long. The service wasn't nice at all and I wouldn't tell anybody to come here when it's crowded.",

I have no problem with the size or amount of grease, I just don't get the greatness of the sandwiches.  We ordered the Kolbassi & Cheese and the Pitts-burger cheesesteak (#2 best seller).  I had half of each one along with cheese fries.  I thought both sandwiches were a little dry especially the cheesesteak.  The coleslaw seemed to be too dry for my taste or maybe it was the abundance of fries that dried everything out for me.  I am not a big fry fan in the first place.  I would like to see some other options for bread like a wheat or whole grain option.  I would also recommend putting extra cheese on the sandwich as I couldn't even taste cheese.  I like cheese and they need more to help balance the dryness.  Service was a little lame as I barely could understand our \"too cool\" server.  He seemed disinterested in us for the most part.  The pregnant waitress who helped us out once seemed more congenial and helpful.  I like the fact that it is small and fast.  I just don't get the vast appeal.  I need sauces, fresh ingredients, whole grains, and cheese.  I would recommend for everyone to try the place once but I bet there is better options in the Burg.",

I sat at the bar and ordered the pastrami sandwich with the provolone, slaw, fries and tomato. The slaw was exactly how I like it; vinegar instead of mayo is the way to go. The fries were pretty good but not amazing. Not sure if they double-fry the fries but they needed to be a bit crispier in my opinion, especially when you consider that they will get automatically soggy on the sandwich. The pastrami had a nice taste but could have tasted more \"homemade\". The Italian bread was a nice touch, but eat quickly or the bread will dissolve into the meat/slaw.   Two complaints. The sandwiches are not as big as you would think. They are bigger than most deli-style sandwiches but not quite as colossal as I thought it would be. Also, the meal is served on a piece of wax paper... This is probably tradition but I think a plate would better suit. All in all, my experience was good at this tourist-flocking sandwich shop.",

Whenever I go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments, I order the house specialty to best judge the place on its supposed merits. Since it was 11 in the morning, I chose not to order Primanti's #1 best seller, which the waitress told me was beer, but perhaps that would have made my experience better. As it was, I ordered the #2 best seller, the cheese steak. It was heinous.   Think a grimy, mechanically separated Salisbury-style steak with a meager slice of provolone on sliced Italian bread served signature Primanti-style: with coleslaw, tomatoes, and fries.  First, the steak was disgusting: terrible flavor (smelled and tasted like hippie armpit, which I'm not necessarily opposed to as long as it's not involved in something I'm trying to eat) with a gross, processed meat texture. Secondly, the fries easily overwhelmed the sandwich, with their old fryer grease taste. Additionally, the sandwich was unwieldy and threatening to fall apart at every turn--a trait I don't hold against decent-tasting sandwiches, but this lack of structural integrity just added insult to injury.   My dining partners were equally disgusted by their choices: corned beef and ham & cheese sandwiches, respectively. Easily the best part of the meal was the Smallman Street Fries, and those were equally lack-luster. The \"bacon\" was simply bacon bits (oh, the humanity!), the chili was uninspired, and the cheese sauce and sour cream did little but soggy the fries. (Did I mention they tasted like old fryer grease?)    I will never go back and I will immediately disregard the culinary opinions of anyone who thinks Primanti Bros. produces decent food.",

I was ordering for take out and I'm not a native from pittsburg so I was browsing the list for looks most appealing..ya know as we humans who have NEVER been to a place before do! And the guy who greeted me at the door was decently pleasant and directed me towards the register for take out. Once i got there, the white lady with red glasses looked at me and quickly turned away with a scowl on her face... and tried so hard to bust herself with other task...UM! She didn't once greet or acknowledge me until 5 mins in while I was searching up the different sandwiches on my phone. When she finally did she went straight to \"you know what you want..\" I smiled and said \"ah I'm just looking to see which sandwich would be most appealing.\" And she directed me back to the list of sandwiches as if I've never seen a friggin list before. The lady beside me looked our way and cringed in response. Smh I walked out.... YIU WONT GET MY MONEY! WITH THAT PISS POOR condescending SERVICE",

    "text": "Prior to coming to Pittsburgh for a three-week stay, I asked my friends and acquaintances what things I needed to do while I was here, and one of them enthusiastically recommended Primanti Bros.   I'm actually not a big sandwich person, so I wasn't expecting to eat at one of these but when I stumbled across the Market Square location, poked my head through the door, and saw a black bean burger on the menu, I quickly found myself a table on the patio. (The music--popular alternative from the past few years--was also a big draw.)  If this happens to be the first review of this place that you're reading, you should know that they put french fries, coleslaw, and (I think) tomatoes on all of this sandwiches. Yes, you read that right--french fries ON the sandwich. I'm not a coleslaw or tomato person, so I ordered my burger with fries only. (I wanted to add lettuce, but they don't have lettuce.)  Absolutely delicious! Both the burger and the fries were wonderful together and individually.   I might just have to go again one more time before I leave PGH, but I might try a different location. I'm not a fan of the fact that the Market Square location only uses disposable cups, etc., because I don't like unnecessary waste. I did, however, peruse through the #primantibros hashtag on Instagram and saw a picture that had a reusable cup in it, so it seems as though not all locations have the same setup.   Last but not least, the wait staff was very quick and friendly.",

On the evening that we did (a Friday), it was fairly busy; a long line out the door almost turned us away, but it didn't take too long for us to get a seat. We ended up getting a spot at the bar.  I really liked the style of the restaurant, and was so eager to try a sandwich for myself. I ended up ordering the Ham and Cheese, which arrived stuffed with cole slaw and french fries in addition to the meat. Holy cow. I'd seen photos of their sandwiches of course, but getting to have the real thing was quite the experience.  Normally food that size is overwhelming for me, but I dove right into that thing and devoured most of it. I was surprised with how well the sandwich itself stayed together, considering how much is pressed between two thick slices of bread.   We did have to wait a good while to get our check, which is my only real complaint, but I understand that it was a super busy Friday dinner. I would still highly recommend giving this place a try if you haven't been before, but maybe not too frequently for those who live in the area. I mean, a weekly diet of meat, fries, and cole slaw probably isn't that good for you. Sure is delicious though!",

I ordered the sirloin steak sandwich on the recommendation of the waitress. A lot of things looked really good on the menu so I needed a little direction. The meat was juicy and tasty, and was overall delicious. The remainder of the sandwich wasn't anything particularly special, but was good enough to leave me satisfied and full. The slaw inside the sandwich was a nice touch, and I also really enjoyed the fries stuffed into the sandwich as well. Beers were relatively cheap and there was plenty of parking around the restaurant. Definitely could see myself coming back to watch a football game or something similar to that.",

    "text": "I visited Primanti Bros. for the first time during a girls' weekend in Pittsburgh. We were visiting a friend who lives there and wanted the 'full Pittsburgh' experience, and a meal here was a must (in my book). I loved everything about the place: the location on Market Square has indoor and outdoor seating, including seating at the counter (which I highly recommend...), the food is great and and the overall atmosphere, though a little touristy, was really fun.  The day we went it was raining lightly, but the place was packed. The outdoor seating, and a portion of the line, are under cover, which was nice, but if the line was really long, and weather worse, you might be standing out in it. The guy at the door did his best to find us seating but we were a group of 8 and had to be split. Half were going to sit inside and half out, but then seating at the counter came up, so half sat at a table and half at the counter, but we were all close enough to see each other.  The counter service was fantastic. Being right in front of the grill guys not only lets you see their process, but lets you get their attention if you need something - like a beverage, a refill on your beverage, or if you just want to order or pay. The other half of our group who sat at a table felt their table service was slower, and because it was crowded and the waitress had to wind through the crowds, there was time in between their sitting and getting menus, then from getting menus to ordering...they actually ordered before those of us at the counter but got served after...and to pay took forever and we ended up taking it up to the register ourselves. Even with what seemed like slowness, all 8 of us were in and out of there in less than an hour.  In terms of the food, this place is really not for those with dietary restrictions...though they do have salads and other items on the menu that are not meat and/or don't have dairy. I split a sandwich with one of my friends - we had the angus beef with fries and slaw on the bread. I thought the sandwich was tasty and that a half was plenty for me. Portions really are large and because the fries come INSIDE the sandwich there's no reason to have to order a side. However, others in our group felt that the chicken was bland and the burger was also flavorless - so maybe it is better to stick with the more flavorful meats like ham, pastrami, or something marinated or fried. Our one friend who had the fish sandwich thought it was awesome.  I would go back again, and I would recommend, especially for the experience. Immediately after posting my pics on FB, friends were messaging me begging me to bring back sandwiches for them (all the way from Pittsburgh to Rochester, NY), so that alone should tell you something! Last comment - for a foodie city like the 'Burgh, sandwiches here are a great value! Just be prepared to wait in the line and wait a little for your food.",

So I spent most of the meal picking fries out of a sandwich that I ordered as a grilled cheese & fries...it was not grilled but lightly warmed bread and the fries dumped into the sandwich, at the time I just found it strange.  In retrospect, I think it's one of the most brilliant sandwich ideas ever.  Now I regularly make panini sandwiches at home with fries in them.  Go to this place with a more open mind than I did and you'll love it...it will be my first stop next visit to the city!",

Just the right amount of meat (I hate it when the meat overpowers the entire sandwich), yummy vinegary cole slaw that made the sandwich refreshing, tomato, swiss, and of course french fries in the sandwich.  It was a good, ginormous sandwich just not as AMAZING as I thought it would be... If I come back to Pittsburgh I'd probably come back to try a different sandwich.",

This location seems smaller than the one on the strip but in general, all the locations are bustling and crowded. Assert yourself in the line; the wait's never that long. I've shied away from the steak and usually go with pastrami, sweet sausage, or fish. Consistency among all the locations is nice. Even the one in the stadium is great!",

    "text": "One night I was watching the Travel channel, they had a show called Top 10 Places to Pig Out.  Of course I paying attention and taking notes :)  When they mentioned Primanti's and Pittsburgh I was like Yes! I'm there!  I could not wait to get my hands on this giant sammich of all sammiches.  My only regret is that I couldn't get it with a Yeungling :( All the more reason to come back!  Ok, so I went here with my host and we decided to strategize.  I got the capicola ham with provolone and he got the steak and cheese.  We got two sammiches and two cokes for $16, what a deal! We were supposed to share but ended up downing our own sammiches. I forgot to ask if the coleslaw was sweet before I ordered so I was a little worried, not a fan of sweet coleslaw.  Luckily, it was great!  Here's the nitty gritty.  The sandwich bread is two thick slices of soft, white italian bread.  They put at least half a pound of meat on it, plenty of cheese, tomatoes, and a fresh coleslaw (not the mayonaissey type that I was expecting).  It's more like a marinated shredded cabbage, the marinade is tangy and vinegary.  The piece de resistance is that the sandwich also contains a huge mound of fries right in the middle.  The fries taste fresh, reminiscent of boardwalk fries back in the day, only better.  At the table they had ketchup, mustard and apple cider vinegar!  Any one from MD would appreciate that ;-)  All I needed was Old Bay seasoning and it woulda been heaven.  Maybe next time I'll take that in my purse...ssshh! Needless to say I devoured this bad boy and desperately needed a nap afterwards.    I came. I saw. I ate.  p.s. You can get it topped with a fried egg! I didn't see that on the menu until I was leaving! doh! next time!",

I was told to sit myself, which is cool since I wanted to sit outside. But then two waitresses kept coming and going without even looking at me. Finally a third came and took my order. I got my usual.... pastrami, extra cheese, no tomato, add egg. When did she miss the \"no tomato\"? I got my sammich (eventually) and there was the tomato. I immediately wanted to send it back but the waitress was gone again MIA. She just disappeared again. I waited as long as I could but she never came back. I finally carried the sloppy tomato seed-covered bread back into the restaurant myself and told the cook I needed a new piece of bread. He gave it to me with a funny look, then I ate my sammich, and then five minutes later the waitress finally showed up. Until then she was just missing. I was so annoyed, but when she came back it was just to refill my drink. A few minutes later I needed my bill, but guess what, she was gone again! I had to walk inside to get my check and then pay it. I was really annoyed. Love me some Primantis but the Market Square one has terrible service.",

My favorite location of the local chain is this one in Market Square.  Even on a busy summer Saturday evening the service is friendly and caring.  Also: I have a happy Christmas memory of eating a big Primanti's meal in the outside Market Square patio section...and enjoying hot chocolate that they seasonally served which was great in the nippy air and surprisingly great with the sandwiches.  In addition to the famous sandwiches the deep fried pub pickles are also yummy.",

    "text": "In short, my sandwich tasted like the great depression but the service was great.  If you need more info, read on.  Came here after a 5 1/2 drive expecting the best sandwich I ever had.  I was served grocery store-quality \"roast beef\" on stale french bread; their Roast Beef sandwich.  No flavor and a serious lack of saltiness.  I can literally make a better tasting sandwich using Oscar Myer lunch meat and table condiments than what I tasted in your roast beef sandwich.  The sandwich sucked; no flavor, no excitement.  We had to add ketchup, salt, pepper, and hot sauce to make it anything other than bland.  I have had better food from back-woods gas stations in Louisiana at mid night than what I was served here.   And the beer menu was mediocre, at best.  No hard hitters, just a couple local beers and generic bullshit.    On the other hand, the fried pickles were great.  And the wait staff were awesome.  They had some pretty big parties to deal with at really busy times and handled it well.  Wait staff was 9/10 but the food was only good enough for the steel workers of the 1930's who needed to fill their bellies with something for energy.    I'm not planning to go back to Pittsburgh, but if I do, I'm not going to this place.  It wasn't worth the trip, wasn't worth the money, and the food (at the very finest) was mediocre(and that is being gentle),   Also, parking was shit.  Enjoy paying an additional $8 2 blocks away for something my kid could have made better in 5 minutes than the 80 minutes we spent there.    I get it, this place is a local legend, but it's sad when every fast food sandwich I have ever had in my life beat what I got for less money.  I've had better sandwiches at Arby's,  My advice:  Locals must not know shit from their asshole.  There are a lot of other great places around this location, go there.  This place really did suck.",

So, I've been around the food block to know a good sandwich when I see one... and the sandwiches here are off da hook!  It's probably unlike any other sandwich you've ever had (unless you're a Pittsburgher, duhhh).  Who puts French fries on a sandwich?  And piles on the sweet and sour cole slaw?  On soft, thick sliced French bread?  Primanti Bros does!    I was in town for work, and of course had to catch a Penguins game...  and was glad to see how close this place was to the arena!  My co-worker and I came here afterward and were majorly impressed.  The corned beef one is sooooo good.  I seriously was sad when it was finished, haha.  I'm sure it's not super healthy, but it didn't feel unhealthy either.  It wasn't greasy, there weren't too many fries on it (a good thing, it was balanced well with probably 8-10 fries on top), the slaw was fresh and crisp, and the corned beef wasn't too greasy at all.  That soft French bread is the perfect surrounding for it all.    The place itself is cool.  It has a nice patio facing the Square, and the inside has a cool diner feel to it.  Service was great and quick, parking was easy... but probably because it was late on a weeknight.  Metered parking, but it was free at that hour. :)  There aren't that many spots on the street, so during the daytime lunch rush or weekend I heard that there is a parking structure nearby.  Oh and prices?  Very reasonable for the amount of food you get.  One sandwich is around $7-8.  I think my sandwich had around 8 slices of corned beef, so that's a great deal.   Also, for what it's worth... we heard from native Pittsburghers that this one in Market Square and the other one on The Strip are the only two you should go to, as the other locations are not up to the same quality.",

However, I've had an obsession with Jordan Staal since I was 12, I took a college visit to the U of Pitt, and I DEFINITELY prefer a Primanti Bros sandwich over a 3 way anyday.  Chillax, I'm not horny; a 3 way is a Cinci \"delicacy\" featuring spaghetti topped with a very thin chili and cheese. Calm down children.  Anywhoo, whilst making this visit to Pittsburgh, I told my padre it was absolutely necessary we eat here. Why? I've seen Adam Richman, Guy Fieri and every other chubby traveling food dude drool over these. I wanted one. Bad.  When you walk in, it's a dive, for sure. Seat yourself, everyone's in sweats, eatin a big hunk o' meat stuffed with french fries and coleslaw.  An Ohio girl can get used to this.  At the (also very chillax) waitress's recommendation I took Cappacola, which apparently is a Pittsburgh tradition. My dad took the Tuna Fish, and we waited...ten minutes. My food is here. And it looks AWESOME. My first bite was, orgasmic. Yes, orgasmic. This sandwich turns me on.  Sorry 3 way.  But this...sandwich...is...amazzzzzzzzzzzing! It's spicy, it's crunchy, it's sweet, it's salty, it's...hey there's bread too! ALL IN ONE. My dad also enjoyed his sandwich, at least I think he did. I'm not quite sure. I was into this love affair way too much. If this were considered cheating on a boyfriend, I would cheat. Every week. Maybe everyday, depending on how often I can get to this sandwich.  I love this sandwich. You will too. You will also be full. Oh so very full. You will have coleslaw coming off your chin and french fries overflowing your basket after you're done. And if you do not finish, you will take it home, or to your hotel, or to the spirit shop down the street and munch on the leftover french fries while the cashiers aren't looking because you're not supposed to be eating in there. (SSH!)  It's THAT good.  P.S.: I got a pen that says Primanti Bros on it. Yeah. Be jealous.",

If this place is considered good to the locals, then I feel sorry for the people of Pittsburgh.  I ordered the Pittsburgher cheese steak and the Kolbassi & cheese. For both sandwiches, the bread used was extremely bland and borderline stale.  The bread would crumble with each attempted bite, eventually leading to me abandoning them.  The fries were so dry and stale tasting as well that I thought it better to just throw them out. The veggies were about average, not fresh, but didn't taste gross.  All that was left were the cheese and the meats. They may have been the most disappointing because I thought that I could maybe at least enjoy that. Essentially, the entire sandwich was inedible and I settled for Five Guys instead.",

Purists will say the Strip or South Side but this is definitely a contender for best Primantis (also don't be fooled by the standalone chains or stadium varieties if that's all you know, these are the 'real' locations).

    "text": "Have you ever watched them make this sandwich?  It's a special craft for sure.  They take two pieces of white Italian bread.  Pile on your choice of meat and cheese....then the grand finale....cole slaw and fries!  Then the put both hands on the sandwich and proceed to smoosh it all down flat. All this is done with their bare hands, no gloves here, so all you sanitary peeps beware!   I don't know why it's such a fantastic sammy, but trust, it is!  I think it's just the combination of delicious (and fatty) ingredients that does the job.  It's just one more food experience that makes Pittsburgh's dining unique.   If you're visiting Pittsburgh, go here?  If you're new to Pittsburgh, go here! If you just need your fill of a sandwich with more sides on it than you usually order in a regular sitting, go here!",

Make sure to get all the toppings with it- slaw and fries! It's usually pretty busy when you go, so you might have to wait a few minutes before you are seated- but I promise, it is worth the wait!!",

It was a good, fresh sandwich, but I left feeling the thick bread, mound of fries and coleslaw diluted the taste of pastrami. Service was good, atmosphere was lively but overall I left feeling unimpressed and wanting better.",

Sandwiches as tall as children and twice as messy. The prices are fair. The rustic tables and dated photos on the walls make a person feel more welcome. They even have Miller products on draft. As a foreigner to this great city Primanti does food well. And when you visit ask for Glenn. He recommended the Capocola and it's amazing.",

Walking in, I took at seat and there was a young man RIGHT THERE offering me a menu. He surprised me.  He Shared with me his idea of what was best and I ordered a diet coke, a roast beef sandwich with the slaw on the side.    I think what surprised me the most was that the sandwich didn't come on a plate, just wrapped in paper.  The slaw, since it was on the side,was a HUGE serving, and in one of the boats you'd get your fries in.  I was told it's best with a bit of hot sauce, since the hot sauce was only cyanne pepper, I tried it.  It was Ok. The slaw was a vinegar based so it was pretty tasty.  The sandwich was rather large.. I could only eat half of it.  The combo of Italian Bread, cheese, meat, fries, tomato and more cheese was absolutely delish. I'd have eaten more if I could.   Damned fine solid sammy.",

We were having trouble figuring out what to eat that would be safe for our buddy (who suffers from many allergies) to eat. Our waitress, Kaetlyn helped us by giving us many options and suggestions. Service was exceptional and any customer would have a fantastic night out. I ordered sweet heat wings which were the most flavorful wings i had ever eaten. The food was hot and fresh, the service was welcoming and fast, and the prices were very affordable. Definitely recommend stopping by Primanti Bros. if you are visiting Pittsburgh!",

Everything about the sandwiches was amazing! I enjoyed every bite. I also enjoyed a very tasty Kentucky Mule.   Primanti Bros was pretty busy when I was there but the service was actually quite fast.

That sandwich is more than big enough and packed with flavor. I had the spicy Italian with a fried egg!  Woo!   Man oh man!!!  It was an event.  Watched some college football had a great sandwich and hung out with my brother. It was a great night.  If you come to Pittsburgh you got to try it. Glad I came.",

When the sandwich arrived the size alone was amazing. But lucky for me it tasted great too! The bread was fresh, the pastrami was tasty, the slaw added a nice kick and did I mention the fries?!

I asked one of servers what he recommended, and he said Pitts-Burger was the most popular sandwich, so i decided to get it. I waited about 20 minutes to get my sandwich. It was big. I had a bite and was very disappointed because the patty was overcooked and french fries are soggy.  The service wasn't good and the staff wasn't friendly at all.

When I went to pick up my order, there was only one line for people waiting for a table, bar seat, and take out orders. I had to wait behind people waiting for seats on the crowded evening while my order should've already been done. We get into the restaurant around 6:50 and we have to wait at the cash register until someone assists us which took YEARS. Our order wasn't even ready yet!!! We watch one of the employees make our order to go, and all the sudden, the bag tips overs. I watch as I see my sandwiches hit the floor. The employee does not notice and proceeds to step on them. I did feel sorry for this guy because it was a busy evening and now he's behind in orders. He quickly makes our order again and gives me the sandwiches at 7:25. I walk back to my hotel to eat with my friends, and as we open our sandwiches, THERE ARE NO FRIES ON THE SANDWICHES! Isn't that why this place is so popular?? So annoyed with the service and the food wasn't even good. We waited nearly an hour for the sandwiches that were mediocre. Good thing they were cheap. Although, looking at the floors at this place, I was so disgusted and it almost made me not even eat these sandwiches. Would not recommend or come back.",

Given the early time of day I didn't explore their alcoholic offering, but they seemed well stocked. The server was kind but clearly inexperienced and would have needed some more supervision, and possibly a keener eye as regards refills. Overall a pleasant quick stop",

The burger itself was virtually flavorless. The fries and coleslaw was a nice and unique touch, but that didn't make up for the lack of flavor. The service left a lot to be desired. Our waiter was pretty aloof and inattentive. Overall, I am not impressed. I can say I've been here. I can also say I probably won't come back.",

The flavors all worked great together, though I would absolutely recommend jazzing up your sammy with some of the available hot sauce.   I can absolutely see why this place is a local favorite.

I asked what was the best seller if the Pitts-burger was the #2, and she recommended the Capicola. There was a line on a Saturday morning so I decided to get it to go and sit at the square. The sandwich was interesting in that I really did not expect the coleslaw and fries to go so well inside a sandwich. The bread was surprisingly soft, which I really enjoyed. I thought the meat and cheese was a bit too little, you could hardly taste it. It was also a tad too dry and bland, but if you're not a fan of really salty food, then you're good. The whole sandwich was too much for me to finish but I managed a half easily.",

I don't eat beef so I guess if you do then get their burger because I think that's the only special thing.  Customer service is bad. Slow actually that's all. We stood in the takeout line forever and the staff was ignoring us and I had to shout to someone behind the grill to let them know I need to order take out. There were three people standing around that could have asked me instead of me asking.   I had the chicken and cheese and it was really good. The filling to bread ratio was bad though. The white bread just gets all soggy and can't hold the weight of the chicken piece. Still tasted good though not the best sandwich I've ever had.",

The server was able to find us a new table which was nice, as it was very busy and I didn't think he would be able to do so. The only issue was that when he asked for IDs for the drinks, he took the IDs and disappeared with them for a little bit and forgot to give them back. Not sure what all of that was about.

    "text": "I knew I had to make a stop at Primanti Bros a priority when I visited Pittsburgh last August! This review is a bit after the fact, but anyway... I had heard so much about their sandwiches and was really excited to try them. The Market Square location is really nice and there's plenty of outdoor seating with pretty city scenery and people watching opportunities. My dad and I chose the Market Square location instead of the original because we were in town to catch a Cubs/Pirates game and this one was within walking distance of our hotel near PNC Park. There's also a stand within PNC Park, but we wanted to get the full experience of one of the standalone restaurants.  I ordered the Turkey and Cheese sandwich and thought it was pretty good. I guess I was expecting a little bit more from it. By more I guess I mean more flavor. Don't get me wrong, it was a great and filling sandwich, but next time I would probably ask for some kind of sauce on it or something. All of the sandwiches are topped with fries, coleslaw, and tomatoes and I wanted to try the classic without any add-ons. I like a good vinegar-y coleslaw with a lot of bite, and this was crunchy but didn't have a ton of flavor.  My dad got medium wings and they were good and spicy. Being from Rochester, we take our wings seriously and these stood up really well to the wings we're used to. Nice and crispy with a good amount of heat and flavor.  I really enjoyed my visit to Primanti Bros and will be back on my next trip to Pittsburgh. I think the Pitts-Burger is next on my list to try.",

Normally it would be mayo but their slaw was more vinegar based. The hint of spiciness/kick from the capicola was a perfect combo with the zing from the slaw.

And I was sitting right at the grill, so he walked by me about 30 times. I figured things were backed up since it was busy, but I finally spoke up after I overheard him and the cook whispering about how he didn't know what I ordered.  The food sucks. Their \"signature sandwich\" is plain white bread, a tiny serving of unseasoned \"sirloin,\" a single slice of flavorless \"provolone\", a big stack of unseasoned French fries on the sandwich, and the blandest \"cole slaw\" I have ever had, then another slice of plain white bread.   You will leave smelling like cooking oil. And their beer selection sucks. They had one local beer, and it's Iron City, which you can get anywhere.

We ordered chilli fries and The Capone. Nothing significant worth mentioning about the fries; the meat in the Tall Boy had a good flavor to it, thankfully. Service was poor as our server was rough and kept practically throwing things onto the table while serving. Wouldn't visit the Market Place spot again.",

We started with and order of terror tots; to quote my uncle, \"it's hotter in Pittsburgh!\" They were smothered in queso cheese, bacon, siracha and jalapenos. They were absolutely delicious, but not for the faint of heart!   We had an assortment of burgers, everyone of them mouth watering and piled high with French fries and Cole slaw! The only draw back was that the fries and Cole slaw were a little over whelming on top of the burger but overall this place was awesome!",

The sandwiches are very large, and are served on thick Italian bread. I got the capicola and cheese, which one of the chefs told me was one of the most popular choices on the menu. The meat was okay, but overall I felt the sandwich was just a bit too greasy. I also wish there were other options for the bread, as I felt it was too thick. I also didn't like that the sandwiches were served on just paper instead of on a plate or basket - the tables were not exactly clean when I got there.",

Almost like they were striving to be unpleasant. If that was the case, everyone certainly delivered. We weren't even there during a busy time (3pm). Can't imagine the attitude during a lunch rush hour... in my opinion they should simply have an ordering window, open seating, and a to-go pick up window. The service, or lack thereof, is a waste of time, energy, and money",

Just fries & coleslaw added into the burger as opposed to being a side - no parking...   Nonetheless, it's something worth trying if you're new to Pittsburgh. But would I go back? Probably not.",

The servers were friendly and quickly got us some local beer and took our orders. We started with the tater tots, and they were by far the best part of the meal. Crispy and delicious. Served with a horseradish sauce. Yum. Then the lunch quickly slipped downhill. I ordered the Salami and Cheese sandwich which came with almost no meat or cheese (less than 10% of contents). The fries just tasted like a mush of plain potato and made up at least 50% of the sandwich. The cole slaw was tasteless (20% of sandwich). The bread was fresh, but there was just too much of it (20% of sandwich). Nothing was seasoned or salted, and everything about the sandwich was bland and boring. I even salted, peppered, and added hot sauce to my food, but nothing helped. This was a very inexpensive meal considering the portion size, but even so, it was not worth the price.  Sorry Primanti Brothers, but I won't be back.",

Service was great but the food didn't have much flavor. The signature drink, the drunk duck, was very sweet although we kind of expected that. The French fries were very good but overall was just not very impressed. Maybe my expectations were set too high. Also wish they had bread options.

The cole slaw is a vinegar based slaw. It is is a little different but it had a nice tang to the sandwich. Although the sandwich was huge there really is not a lot of meat. You can ask for additional meat for a small charge. Overall it was a good experience but not quite as mind blowing as Guy described.",

It was busy but we were able to be seated immediately. The waitress was running around like crazy but she took pretty good care of us. She did get my order wrong but I was willing to keep the wrong sandwich but she came back within 5 minutes with my correct one and apologized. That is great customer service. I am glad she did get me the correct one because I really wanted the ham and provolone.  So, the thing here that stands out to me (loving the north bread and missing it since I live in Orlando) is the BREAD! So freaking fresh and moist. So fluffy. You make fingerprints in it when you hold it, I love that.   So my concern, the coleslaw... I hate mayo but here they make it with vinegar, win!   Amazing bread, coleslaw, fries and tomatoes with whatever meats you want, delicious.  This is a must stop in Pitt just as everyone knows and tells you so do yourself a favor and listen to them!",

I had to try the Pitts-burger which is their burger with cole slaw and french fries added. Sometimes with tv shows they hype up a place that just ends up being \"meh\". However, Primanti's is one of those places that actually fits the hype.  The place has a nostalgic feel to it, kind of like a renovated bar from the old days. Surrounded by drawings of famous people who have come to Primanti's (this is the original location), we sat at the counter to order. The people behind the counter were friendly and helpful.   We ordered the Pitts-burger which is the #2 seller. The slaw is not creamy but rather vinegary which added a nice sour taste to the savoriness of the burger itself. Of course, adding fries to the burger is a win! It's simple and very good so I can see why our friends who had visited Pittsburgh all told us to try Primanti's. It's a staple in two and has a great history serving some really good food.",

The BLT tots are delicious and the wings are some of the best we've ever tried, especially the maple chipotle bbq and spicy garlic. Service is usually fast and friendly.",

This location is much smaller than the others. There's no good way to get a group of 8+ people together here.  It's downtown near offices but doesn't seem to suit the after-work get together well. The food is still a decent value but that's about all it has going for it.",

I was initially a little skeptical but highly recommend this location over the original!  The sandwiches are just as good, if not better, in Market Square and actually bigger. I attribute this to the mostly male staff here vs. female in the Strip District since they seem to make most of their sandwiches based on \"handfuls.\"  I also enjoy the atmosphere at this location best. Yes, it's still a bit divey, but it's less diner and more bar than the Strip District Primanti. Overall, I recommend this restaurant as a great, inexpensive place to grab a sandwich and beer in Market Square.",

    "text": "My wife and I stopped here on our most recent trip to Pittsburgh. Neither of us had had dined at this Pittsburgh institution before, and we both wanted to try it after being told by our Pittsburgh friends that we had to go here. We ate here on a beautiful Sunday at noon when the Pirates and Penguins were playing, so it seemed busier than normal and we had to wait to be seated. No worries, we were seated fairly quickly inside. The restaurant itself was styled like mid-1900s diner and was really pretty cool. Service was quick and before I knew it I had a Pittsburgher sandwich - the quintessential Primanti Bros meal. It was a sizable sandwich stacked with Pittsburgh cheesesteak, coleslaw, fries, and tomatoes. The coleslaw was tangy but not creamy (a plus in my book), the fries were crispy, and the meat was tender. The meat and bread both left me wanting more. The Italian bread was thick...and that's about all I can say for it. Wholly generic otherwise. The meat also lacked any distinguishing flavor other than \"meaty.\" I really could have used some more seasoning and flavor from the two biggest components of the sandwich. I'm glad we made it out to Primanti Bros, but I'm not sure I'd rush back, especially since Pittsburgh has so much else to offer. Chances are good that if you're visiting from out of town, you'll wind up here. You should try it once, then move on to better local establishments.",

It's a compact, greasy Pittsburgh right.    Yes, the place is small, it is in Market Square, and will remain there, wouldn't you be disappointed if one day you wanted Primanti's and no more Market Square location?  I know I would.  If I were in the downtown region and had that craving I wouldn't want to have to work my way up to the Strip just for a bite of that Pittsburgh goodness.    The 'it's a Pittsburgh' thing comments baffle me.  If you have food shows featuring the sandwich, magazines writing about it, and it's considered the 'Manliest Restaurant in America,'  I think that means it's more than just a Pittsburgh thing.  Why else would Primanti's be featured on such media?  Why else would these people centered around shows and magazines venture to a Primanti's?  I mean that has to show you it's more than just a Pittsburgh thing.  And 'it's so greasy?'  Did you not watch them makes your sandwich, which you picked from their extensive menu, on the griddle in front of you?  Expect it to be greasy, they are frying it for you and melting that cheese on it.  Maybe don't even pay attention to the greasy factor, especially with that crunchy coleslaw and heap of fries placed between those two thick slices of Italian bread.    Better yet, move out of my way, I'm about to chow down on that Pittsburgh grease fest awaiting my attention.",

If you want a semi fast food place where you sit down and actually take time to eat, you can order and eat and be out relatively quick. Prices are great!

THEN I took my first trip to Pittsburgh, took a chance on the real deal... and boy oh boy did I become a Primanti's lover!  Everytime we go to Pittsburgh, we hit Primanti's for lunch.  We have to!!  I never want to start a trip to Pgh out without hitting Primanti's... pronto!  =)    Primanti's is a great little spot to grab lunch, dinner, and even a mid-day snack.  I love the fact that this place is always jammed full of people.  Their food is well worth the wait and the effort it takes to tackle a table before someone else does.

This was my second supremely dissapointing Primanti's experience in nearly a decade of living in this fine little city.  I guess the fascination with this place must be that it it 1. has a bar 2. you don't have to order a side of fries or coleslaw because it's all gonna be slathered on your sandwich.  Bleh!  On my first Primanti experience, I ordered a corned beef sandwich as it shoud be, no fries or coleslaw on it.  So I was served 2 slices of bread and about 1.5 slices of corned beef.  What a rip off.  2nd experience, today, equally as awful.  But as i said... waitstaff was great.  I ordered a \"Pitts-burger\" with coleslaw and fries on the side.  Seriously, the quality of the burger I was served made 7-11 mini mart burgers seem gourmet.  I guess you really see what their overpriced, crappy sandwiches are truly made of when you strip off the fries & coleslaw.  Their fries are also soggy and gross.  Not a whole lot goin' on here except for cutie/attentive waitresses.    If you want a decent, GIANT-sized sandwich and a real PGH experience, go to Peppi's.",

We ordered our sandwiches - I got the Rajun Cajun because I had a Philly Cheesesteak the day before and was trying to cut back on red meat. I kind of regretted it as the chicken was a bit dry. My coworkers had ordered  the pastrami and steak and made me wish I had. Not that the sandwich wasn't good - but red juicy meat would have been so much better.  The sandwich was massive - I got a huge piece of chicken breast with a crapload of coleslaw and fries on top.  My coworker did complain that he got very little pastrami meat on his.

    "text": "Alright, I heard about this chain on Man v. Food and we just had to try it out. And honestly, we were quite disappointed. The sandwich is tasteless unless you douse it with condiments or get a particularly flavorful filling. I got the cheese one and my boyfriend got the colossal fish (both vegetarians--its not so friendly for us...fail). Neither sandwich was impressive--in size or taste. I'm a 5\"4' and 120lb girl and I finished mine no problem. Just incredibly bland. The bread tasted like cheap white bread, the fries were just incredibly greasy, the cole slaw was hardly cole slaw and more like wet cabbage. The cheese on mine was basically tasteless and my boyfriends fish was definitely from a box of something frozen. Very disappointing.",

    "text": "I wanted Pittsburgh food, and the internets sent me here.  Do not be intimidated to walk in this dump.  I went to the take out line and ordered a spicy sandwich something or another.  The bartenders are either overworked or just don't give a shit cause I waited for a while before ordering.  But stay strong, and look them down until they take your order. PS make sure you get sauce in those little packets.  Sammich is at best 6/10 but is comes with fries on the sandwich, fries!! Isn't that crazy everyone, fries on a sandwich!",
