    "text": "The Red Tea House beats the Sesame Inn hands down- it's the best Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The restaurant is located in a minimall at the end of Greentree Road.  The decor is outdated, but don't let these two things hold you back from visiting.  Upon entry we were greeted kindly at each visit.  The menu is expansive yet reasonably priced.  Shortly after we were seated, we got a hot pot of black tea and fried wonton strips for dipping in a sweet or spicy mustard sauce.  The tea was great, but at some visits it's a little stronger than others.  Because the portions are so large, we have taken to getting a sushi appetizer (always fresh and never fishy) and splitting a meal.  Although cliche, the General Tso's is always meaty, crispy and has the perfect amount of spice.  I have also had seafood, orange and seasame chicken and was never disappointed.  We were never charged a split plate charge.  Usually the bill only comes out to $25 for two people and we left stuffed.  Service is not super fast, so I wouldn't recommend going if you are in a rush.",

Delivery is quick and the food always arrives piping hot. They may seem a little pricey compared to other places but the size of the portion and the quality is well worth the few extra bucks. Additionally, they have the best wonton soup I have ever had! It doesn't  look like much but it packs huge flavor. The only down fall is the limited delivery hours. Still a must try.",

We ordered the shredded beef, onion chicken and black pepper chicken. We also got a plate of the Hawaiian fried rice. Chinese food can often be greasy but these dishes took some serious liberties with oil. Flavor of everything was minimal and the sticky rice was dry. The black pepper chicken would rank as the best of the worst.  I can honestly sum up my experience there in one word - bland. I am not sure if this is typical fare or if it was an off day. It was dissatisfying and quite disappointing.",

Each piece was real white meat chicken with some flavorful coating (unlike other places where there is a tiny amount of meat and it's dark meat). The fried rice was very fresh and flavorful as well. Although the outside looks a little sketchy, it's very nice inside, and the prices match that of any other place. I think our general tso's plates (which contained so much food it was like two meals in one) were about $7-8. Also, the sushi was phenomenal (they also draw little designs on the plate if you're into that lol). We made this our \"go-to\" place after one visit.",

    "text": "Eh, I don't get all of the great reviews. My husband and I ordered delivery from Red Tea House on a friday night for dinner. He was fasting for Orthodox Christmas so he ordered Tofu in the general tso's sauce. I decided to try the beef in garlic sauce and we also had edamame. We both noted that the prices seemed a little steep but we were hoping it was because the food was amazing like the other reviewers noted. The delivery arrived by the time quoted and contained our entire order. First, we tried the edamame. We are both huge edamame fans and you can't really get edamame wrong, right? Wrong. Half the edamame wasn't completely cooked and was hard. Next, for my beef with garlic sauce, I was surprised that the beef was in strips. I'm talking like the width of shoe strings and although the menu description did not note vegetables, the container was full of onions and peppers. In fact, the dish was mostly veggies with a side of beef. I was also surprised by the level of spice in my dish. The menu does note that the dish is spicy but I usually ignore the spicy sign because I love spicy dishes and most dishes that say they are spicy I consider mild. Well they were not lying about being spicy. I could only eat about 10 bites before I had to stop because my mouth was on fire. Not complaining because again, I love the spicy but, important to note when ordering a spicy dish, they mean business. I also spent the extra dollar to get the fried rice. This was also a mistake as the rice was cooked with some soy sauce and egg. No veggies, no pork, no flavor. My husband did enjoy the general tso's sauce and thought it had a good balance of tang and sweet. If we go back, maybe next time we'll try the sushi.",

Whatever dough they use, they use way too much of it and it overpowers the pork inside. I wouldn't order it again.",

The restaurant is attractive and comfortable.  The staff, led by owner Chen and his wife, are cordial, gracious, accommodating, always with a smile.  I asked the host to provide corkage for our bottle of wine and he not only did that, but provided an ice bucket which he placed at the side of the table: all of this at no charge. I like that the delicious crispy noodles are brought to the table with hot tea and water to begin the meal. The egg rolls are the most delicious and substantive of any ($2.25) and there are three types available.  My favorite Chinese soup is served here: chicken velvet corn soup, which is egg drop soup with chicken.  It was served piping hot. My fiancee had hunan chicken with broccoli, pea pods, and corn.  This was the first time I ordered Thai food here and it was fantastic: pad thai with fried tofu and chicken, $13.  The portions were outstanding and we both had food to take home even though I am a very hearty eater.  For $36+, we had a feast which will make almost two more meals at home.  Red Tea House puts the well-known and well-patronized Sesame Inn to shame, and it is somewhat less expensive. My highest praise to Red Tea House for the perfect dining experience!",

The lunch deals are all cheaper than $10 with tax and tip. Also, it seems that green tea comes with it complimentary -- at least, we had some and we didn't order it.  It was our server's first day, but other staffers helped cover for her and we were well taken care of.  I ordered General Tso's chicken. It was spicy and flavorful, without being overly sweet. It tasted much, much better than the stuff at a lot of take out places and the mall. You can tell superior ingredients are used.   I look forward to visiting again.",

I subscribe to groupon offers and saw this particular restaurant offered crispy fried beef which up to now I have only been able to get at City Lights in Washington DC.  So it was an easy decision to get the groupon.  We had a fabulous meal here.  The crispy fried beef was better than what I have in DC.  Hubby ordered the special General Tso's that had chicken and shrimp.  Lots of food, tasty accompanied by some kind of chips and hot tea.  The service was attentive, perhaps overly so, but then again our waiter clearly wanted to please.  We often go to San Francisco for our chinese so I am comparing it with some top rated places.  I loved this place and can't wait to return.",

The renovations are awesome and the restaurant is now quaint and up to date. However, the seating is cramped and the atmosphere is now awkward because you can pick lice out of the child's hair at the  neighboring table.   My wonton soup was bland, my egg roll was made of old shrimp and dad's raw meat, and my sushi was mealy and room-temperature. I didn't even use the full value of my groupon and I honestly don't care. I will never make it a point to visit red tea house again.",

We ordered basic Chinese takeout items, 2 vegetable fried rices, chicken and broccoli, and vegetable steamed dumplings. Everything (including price) was exactly what you want from Chinese takeout! The portions were huge, easily having a couple lunches out of it. The chicken and broccoli was just perfect. Fried rice was tasty too! The dumplings were good, they weren't that hot but also I think I prefer egg rolls. Anyway, we will definitely be ordering (through Yelp!) again in the future!",

After sampling Mekong's lo mien on Potomac Ave, I thought it was acceptable, but coming in here I realize that it may have been a notch up from acceptable to fairly okay. I ordered the shrimp lo mien here and it wasn't nearly as filled with the good stuff like Mekong was. Mekong PACKED their lo mien full of veggies. This was just a little shrimp, some cabbage and a ton of noodles. But the noodles weren't very flavorful. I just need a little flava in my life!

I ordered take out a couple months ago after seeing how busy they always are and some good reviews here on Yelp. I ordered cheese wontons, sweet and sour chicken, and pork fried rice. My total was about $18.00 which I didn't think was too bad for the portion size. When picking up my order the restaurant was busy and the man cashing me out was very kind, so I was very excited to get home and eat, thinking this meal would be pretty great. Once I got home, I started off with the cheese wontons. To my unfortunate surprise, the cheese wontons had a stringy type of cheese when I pulled them apart. Anyone with a brain knows that cheese wontons certainly should not be filled with any sort of cheese that's stringy. They tasted awful. I threw the whole rest of the order away and decided to try my luck at the sweet and sour chicken and rice. The chicken was completely mushy and the vegetables were in massive chunks. I suppose ordering a crispy food for take out can have this effect but I was disappointed nonetheless. The fried rice however tasted just plain bland. I thought at least I'd have hope with the rice but it was awful. I threw the entire meal in the trash along with the $18 I spent on it. It was just such a mediocre meal and I was disappointed. Sorry Red Tea House, I guess you're just not my cup of tea.",

After making our monthly Giant Eagle supermarket trip, Kay and I decided that a Chinese meal just felt like the proper thing to do last Sunday evening, and what better, more convenient choice for such cuisine was there than the Red Tea House,  another of many suburban shopping center surprises around the Pittsburgh area.  Damn it if Kay had to go an order the Plum Duck with its uncannily unctuousness that was felt profoundly by both tooth and taste receptor alike. Nearly without bones and awash in a deep, dark, deadly, dulcet, and depravedly delightful plum sauce the menu incorrectly described as \"delicate,\" I was once again overcome with emulousness over a duck dish Kay had ordered, but the bountiful  portions of both our meals was conducive to sharing, even if Kay was understandably reluctant to do so.

    "text": "Stick to the Chinese food here and you won't be disappointed. The egg rolls are great and the portions are what you want when you want to curl up on the couch with takeout Chinese food. I can only give three stars though because tonight I decided to venture outside the Chinese food menu and it was a mistake. I ordered a California roll for my daughter which is a pretty easy roll to get right. It wasn't bad, but was not good either. The 'crab' was subpar even for imitation crab. I have not tried their real sushi so I hate to judge based on this roll alone.   The chicken wings however were so unbelievably bad they knocked this place down quite a bit in my mind. I was hoping for a nice crispy wing with a little hot chili sauce. I knew as soon as I saw these I was in for it. They were drenched in a really sweet sauce, barely any heat at all, but the real crime was the wing it self. I'm not even sure that there was chicken on the wing. There was about 1/2 inch of really soggy breading (soaked in the sweet sauce) and then a bone. I tried two and could not eat any more. I asked everyone else to try them and they stoped after one bite. We sadly threw away the rest.  So I hate to judge a place based on one thing, but when that thing is so incredibly bad, you want to make sure no one else makes the same mistake. Next time I'll stick to the garlic chicken.",

Although it was a bit empty, the people that were there felt comfortable as if they were at home. As soon as you sit, they serve you with tea and some crunchies for you to snack on.   We ordered a hot and sour soup, half a duck, eggplant with chicken and a salmon roll for sushi. Our waitress messed up our order and gave us the salmon nigiri instead of the salmon maki. It wasn't a big deal but I preferred the maki. The food came out promptly after the sushi. I did enjoy the food but it wasn't anything that I was blown away by. The hot and sour soup was good especially with the crunchy wontons that they had given us at the beginning. The half duck was good too but I couldn't taste much of the sauce that it came with. Since we ordered a lot, we didn't finish most of it so we asked for the food to be packed to go.",

It had an odd rubbery taste. We gave the benefit of the doubt and ordered again. We ordered General Tsos and pad Thai. We are stilling the effects from the level of spice. My pad thai was so spicy it didn't even taste like pad Thai. It was so spicy that it numbed out all the flavor. The general tsos had the same effect. We have never had such spicy Chinese food. Like I mentioned before, normally very good food but maybe they got a new cook. Maybe someone is heavy handed with the spice. But this meal was border inedible.",

We did order different items on the menu but over all, we had a better experience. We ordered the general tso chicken and hunan crispy chicken. The food was well packed and hot this time. We also got hot and sour soup which was very good. The chicken was moist and decently flavorful. The portion was enough that I had enough for lunch the next day but my bf ate it all in one sitting. We got 1 big container of rice which i didn't like but we like each other enough to share. It wasn't the best we have had but it was pretty good. The favor of the Tso was not as sweet as like it l. I added some hot sauce to get to get it a lil more flavor.   I think this time was way better than the fist time. They even delivered to us as well. It took about an hour to get everything so we will prob pick it all up next time to save time.   Overall, I think we would come back to try other items because we thought we we ordered was pretty decent.",
