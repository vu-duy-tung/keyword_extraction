The bad: You cannot make it out in under an hour. Hopefully it is just because they are new, however each time I try to go for lunch the line is out the door. I waited once and it took almost 40 minutes. The next time I tried to order ahead online around 12:15, but received an error that due to heavy volume, my order could not be ready until 1:30 - over an hour!  Bottom line: Good food and friendly people, but not conducive to the working crowd or the Oakland lunch hour.",

Ordered from ubereats - all the pictures looked like these big stuffed sandwiches and this delicious colorful pasta and these big parm stick rollups... Well, they didnt have our drinks and never called to tell us. So we had nothing to drink. The cheese rollups were ONE. the pictures look like you may get a few, they'd be big and cheesey... maybe the size of a long fruit rollup and I could see straight through end to end - not a lot of substance. The sandwhiches were awful. They were much smaller than I expected, and there was literally nothing in them! One piece of maybe half a chicken finger, a soggy piece of lettuce jammed in the back, you couldn't even see the sauce at all, or anything else... even the pasta, was just noodles with some olive oil. Nothing else. We were so hungry, ordered $40 worth of food, and didn't even eat half of it because it was just bread and semi dry noodles. Like I said, I hope it was just a new person in the kitchen or some weird occurance... really sucked. And man if you don't have something someone ordered, please tell them! Eating bread and pasta with nothing to drink is no fun.",

I was also pleased with the cannoli chips. As a former New Yorker, I wasn't sure what I would get but, they totally brought me home - the shells or chips were perfect and the filled was superb.

The actual wrap itself was very thin and almost crispy, the filling was very fresh tasting and tasty, I had sausage, roasted red peppers, and artichoke hearts.  I also had the pepperoni roll which was great.  The service was friendly and fast, the entire setup is basically Chipotle but with Italian food instead of Mexican. There was also a very corporate vibe to the layout and decor, quite sterile and over-lit.  The music being piped in was terrible as well. Basically it's a great place to grab a bite to go but I wouldn't hang out in there.",

They brush the wraps with some kind of butter/oil and season it with pepper before filling it, so it's super flavorful. The lobster bisque is amazing too. I tried the seasonal fall piada with sweet potato, arugula, avocado, and thick pancetta bacon and it was great. Everything is pretty high in calories though so definitely not for those looking to cut carbs. But the service is great, very fast and the guy taking our order and prepping the wraps was doing fun tricks with his utensils just for entertainment.",

It's in a nice location, right on Forbes going into Oakland and wasn't too hard to find parking and walk over.   Walking in, it took us a few minutes to figure out what we wanted. The Tusca sandwiches and piada roles sounded interesting, but we were hesitant to try something new. My wife and her mom stuck to salad and my father in law and I had the basil pesto pasta with chicken, sun dried tomatoes, and freshly grated parm cheese. We also spilt a pepperoni roll between the 4 of us as well. We all very much appreciated the fresh ingredients for a very reasonable price. The regular sized pasta was enough to split with someone. The only issue I had was that there could have been more sun dried tomatoes and chicken to balance out the portion sizes. Regardless, it was very good and the pepperoni role was delicious!   I will keep this place in mind when I am in the area. I want to try their piada next time.The Tusca sandwiches will also be on my mind next time I go. Fresh ingredients at a fast food price is very hard to beat!",

    "text": "Currently wishing that there was a Piada's in my area because this place was really good. We were new to ordering here so a little explanation would have been helpful. The basic idea is you order off of their menu, which has a small handful of offerings between sandwiches, pasta, and bowls and then you go through the line (similarly to a chipotle) and customize your order. I got the Mediterranean bowl and added a protein. I wasn't sure if I was allowed to add anything else, some feta would have been nice. But I kept it simple and only added the chicken when asked. Salmon would have been another great option. Everything about my meal was delicious. The dressing was a perfect topping and the quinoa was cooked really well. All the vegetables were roasted perfectly. Other highlights from my parties order included a chef's special with the salmon, the meatballs, and pasta - with pesto. The experience was a little overwhelming when ordering as it seemed a bit chaotic and there are lots of specific sayings the staff have to use. They had a hype man (manager?) who cued the staff along the way. They also have really great drinks aside from just regular fountain drinks. The bathroom at this location is really small though. Like super small.  But definitely check out their food, it's the quality and flavors that stand out.",

    "text": "My husband and I took my parents here after doing some fun things in Oakland, and what a cool experience it was! Just by observing how busy it was, from families to students, we knew it had potential.   Honestly, there were so many items I wanted to try on the menu and of course was limited to one entree. After switching back and forth 5+ times, I settled on the Farmers Market Salad. When going to order, the concept reminds you of a Chipotle or Moe's. You give your order to the first staff member and he alerts the rest of the staff lined up on what is to come. Each member has their specific job and they all worked together so well, with an upbeat, positive attitude.   By just glancing over the ingredients, it was evident that all prepped foods were as fresh as can be. From chicken right off the grill to roasted corn and homemade dressings, the selection was incredible. My salad was crisp and full of ingredients - the staff even allowed substitions when I stated my dislike for feta. It was large enough for two meals! My mother had the same entree while both my husband and father had the Pesto Pasta with added chicken - just as delicious! We topped the meal off with a pepperoni piada and a hibiscus tea drink.   If you are interested in a modern, fresh twist on Italian, give this place a shot. I look forward to another excellent experience here. I will be back for a piada or tasca!",

    "text": "A tastier version of Chipotle At lunchtime, this rather trendy looking restaurant had a line of college students and staff from nearby Magee Hospital that extended out the door. We decided to return for an early dinner and liked the food a lot. A \"piada\" is a very thin wrap, and the assembly-line approach is similar to Chipotle in which you choose what goes into the wrap, but I thought the final result was tastier than Chipotle. I had a chicken piada and my wife had a salmon pasta bowl with angel hair pasta. Both were very good and we will return. Prices were reasonable.",

I placed my order around 11am and selected 11:45 for pick up. I arrived at 11:40am and thought I may have to wait but my order was ready. The gal who received my online order said she made my food right when she got the ticket???? ugh. So my food sat there for a while. It was a salad and thankfully it was still okay when I brought it back to my office.   I dined in for my second experience and it was much better. I heard from coworkers that this place gets a wicked line around 12pm so I told my friends we should meet at 11:45am and it's a good thing we did. The awkward line area was consistently full from 12-1pm.   Ordering the food was a bit overwhelming. They shouted out many questions!!! Thankfully they did so with a smile on their faces. They also must have sensed the sheer panic on my face and guided me along.  I got the BLT Tasca sans the B. It was delicious!!!! The bundle comes with a side and a drink; the street corn and hibiscus lemonade were a great pairing for this delicious sammy.   Very good, will go back.... but not too often, there are a few less expensive/similar quality places in the area.",

I love the spacious modern/minimalist design which gives the place an upscale atmosphere even though it's a fast-food casual eatery. Staff were very efficient, friendly, and professional.  Food: Well-executed \"Chipotle\" of italian food complete with burrito equivalent. Paida focuses on well-executed sauces combined with your preference for starch, veges, and protein. We got the piadas for which the place is named for and they're essentially glorified wraps with lettuce, veges, and we got chicken. The Chef's Favorite was by far the better of the two wraps with a rich slightly-spicy slighty-tangy sauce that quite delicious. The tuscan was more mild-mannered but had a light and clean flavor that let the chicken do more of the heavy-lifting. For $8.50 the wraps were satisfying but not filling. The pepperoni stick was nothing special in the sense that it's a bunch of pepperonis in a wrap and grilled. It was a little greasy but the pepperoni did have a good flavor with a smidge of spice.  Overall we really enjoyed our meal and would gladly come back for a quick bite. Definitely worth a try.",

Unfortunately, I didn't find anything about Piada to be all that special. Basically, your menu choices are wraps, salads, or pasta. For \"Italian street food,\" I didn't expect to see salads and pasta on the menu, but then again, I'm not entirely familiar with Italian street food.   My husband and I both ordered pasta when we came, as it was dinner and we wanted something more substantial. All pasta dishes use angel hair, and I thought my pesto sauce and his carbonara tasted kind of similar. While the pasta was filling, nothing about it stood out.   Overall, just average. Meh, probably won't be back with so many other options for good food in Oakland.",

The line cooks / staff were all very friendly and it was clear that the chef was in training mode and was great to his staff members (something I pay attention to and appreciate when I see it).   I tried the Farm Club Tasca and added the Seasonal Harvest Grain side - plenty of food for lunch, but so good I couldn't stop myself from finishing it all! The Harvest Grain was sweet, spicy, and all around delicious. I will definitely be getting that again!   The Farm Club had great flavor and I loved the spicy balsamic aioli and avacado and the pancetta was cooked to perfection! All of that with buttermilk fried chicken on a light wrap made me a very happy lunch customer! All of that was around $9, so it's less or on-par with most of the other local places and from what I saw, might be a step above!   I'll be back, Piada!",

The Diavolo has a spicy, creamy tomato sauce. You can add your veggies as you please. I tried the Farmer's Salad once and it was delicious, but I can get a salad anywhere. The Piada sticks are very tasty; be sure to dip them in the Parmesan sauce. You can get the sticks with or without pepperoni. They introduced the blackberry lemonade which is delicious and comes in a large cup. I love love love the lobster bisque (it tastes better than Red Lobster's)!   The food is excellent, but I want to take the opportunity to comment on the commitment to quality service. The staff will ask you how your day is going while preparing your order or waiting for an ingredient to complete an order. This is something I noticed in my last visit and really appreciated. This is not a common occurrence at most quick-service restaurants so it's a nice change up.",

The restaurant was heavily staffed and everyone was very friendly. The interior was very rustic modern with lots of wood and white.   I ordered the chef's favorite piada with fried calamari and my friend ordered the spicy diavolo pasta with salmon. Once I ordered the piada, the lady heated up the thin piece of dough on a huge griddle. Then, it was passed down a long assembly line. Another lady put the spicy diavolo sauce and parmesan sauce. Then someone else put the lettuce, peppers, and finally the calamari was put on.   The piada itself was very different from anything I had before. The calamari was cooked well and not too chewy. The sauces added a nice tangy spicy taste. It was also surprisingly filling. My friend's spicy diavolo pasta with salmon was pretty big. The salmon was lacking flavor.   We were also able to sample the sides once we sat down. The lobster bisque was very creamy and tasted great. The parmesan dipping sauce for the cheese stick made the cheesestick. Finally, we had the cannoli chips, which were a sweet delicious ending. Overall, it was a great event",

I have been getting the emails for a few weeks now and the food looks amazing. I liked how everything looked so fresh and so good!   We got there right at 6 PM and it was super empty. There was one other table in the restaurant with a few girls but that was it. BUT boy did it really fill up fast! The place was bumping in about 15-30 minutes. We were greeted right away and the door person was really efficient. We got our tickets scanned and looked through the menu. I thought that possibly the door person could have explained the menu and what we were allowed to get or not allowed to get a bit more. I didn't really understand what a Piada was or if we were only getting one thing or half a thing and half another thing. I went back to her to ask. I got my clarification quickly and we ran back into the line!  We decided to get two different pasta dishes because those looked the best on the menu.   I decided to order the  BASIL PESTO PASTA:Parmesan alfredo, fresh basil pesto, sundried tomatoes, freshly grated parmesan. I added more sundried tomatoes, extra fresh tomatoes,grilled chicken, and extra pesto sauce. One thing I can say is that the portion sizes are ridiculously huge. The pasta was premade but was not stale at all. The ingredients tasted really fresh and I enjoyed the veggies. I will say that the pesto had a strong taste of oregano. I had my friend also try it and we both decided it was slightly overwhelming, not pesto like at all, just more oregano. The alfredo also was not as strong as I usually like an alfredo to be. It just was not parmesan based it felt. It was just a bit dull. The plate was good, but eh.. I don't know if I would get it again.   My friend got the PESTO POMODORO MEATBALL:100% grass-fed beef meatball, pomodoro sauce, fresh basil pesto drizzle, freshly grated parmesan. She loved the meatball, I thought it was just ok. But we both thought that the red sauce was a lot better than the alfredo. I would get this one again, but maybe with a different meat than the meatball.  I also tried some of their Italian sodas, never again. TOOOO SWEEEETTT for me. I had to dump it out and get some water.  We also got little samples of the cannoli chips; yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Give me some more of this for sure. The little bit that we got, yummy! And we got to sample the tomato and lobster soups. NOPE. They were too thick. They needed to really be less thick and watered down. The flavoring was too strong.   I will go back again, I know I will. But this time I might want to try out their sandwiches or those good looking salads!",

I came with a friend for the pre-grand opening as a VIP, I came eagerly and was delighted. The staff was super attentive and knowledgeable. I appreciate that they let me add croutons to my meatball pomodoro pasta dish, as well as veggies to my liking (I recommend the sweet and spicy peppers as well). I've since been back on a \"regular\" day and the staff and food was just as lovely.  My roommate has had the chicken piada (I haven't had anything besides the meatball pasta.. omg so good), but she's a fan. Love this place!!",

I like the set-up (it's very similar to Hello Bistro, Lotsa, Qdoba and Chipotle in how the workers guide you in creating-your-own food down line). They also offer signature menu items.  The food itself was good for a fast-food Italian place. I honestly felt so fancy being there as the interior is classy and clean.  The service there was very nice. The workers were all smiles and suggestions. You can tell they actually put care into your food.  The price is honestly very fair for what they give you.  I definitely will come and try again! It's a nice, but not-too-nice place to go with friends/significant others. A great place to just take-out food as well.",

    "text": "I attended the pre-opening of Piada Italian Street Food in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh. Piada Oakland is defined as, \"a fast casual, authentic eatery serving hand rolled Piadas, Pasta Bowls and Chopped Salads\". Their namesake signature meal, the Piada, is actually a wrap an, \"Italian thin crust dough, baked on our grill and hand-rolled with fresh,  ingredients\". They also offer feature or build your own pastas and salad.  My BF and I were each treated to a complimentary meal, drink, and samples of various Piada menu items. Out of all the delicious menu items I selected the Basil Pesto Pasta with steak including, \"fresh basil pesto, Parmesan Alfredo, sun-dried tomatoes, freshly grated Parmesan\". I was served a huge portion of pasta. It was very good, but a little off on the ratio of pasta to sauce for my tastes. I definitely wanted more sauce and cheese to top off my dish. I still enjoyed it though.  BF ordered the Chef's Favorite Piada of \"spicy diavolo sauce, romaine, sweet & spicy peppers, mozzarella, creamy Parmesan\". He enjoyed his Piada saying, \"It was nice and saucy, the crunchy chicken was delicious\".  We also sampled the pepperoni Piada sticks, lobster bisque and a quinoa & grain salad. We then hunted out the coveted dessert cannoli chips with chocolate chip cream, which were definitely messy but worth it!  Overall I was glad to have been invited to the pre-opening of Piada Oakland and enjoyed the meal. I think that this fast-casual option will do really well in the Oakland location with the hospital employees, visitors and the college crowd there. Great feature and build-your-own healthy & fulfilling menu options sure to please that area's crowd. Find it on Forbes Ave where the Quaker Steak used to be.",

Their technique involves the following: - Scoop a bunch of pre-cooked spaghetti pasta - Stir them around aimlessly in a heated pan (without placing the pan on a stove) - Toss in raw vegetables or cold protein - Apply a light scoop of pasta sauce - Take your money  Other options on the menu include sopping, greasy calamari, and oily \"Piada sticks\". I cannot recommend this place, even for a fast-Italian fix. To me, pasta needs to be generously covered in sauce and served hot. My suspicion is that Piada is patronized by individuals who are tired of the other uninspiring lunch options in Oakland. Nevertheless, please do not settle and accept the food from here as adequate Italian street fare.",

The menu has a nice range of items from a variety of pasta, salads, and sandwiches and you could choose the type of protein to top your pasta. All the pastas and salads were mixed fresh there as you watched and were prepared very quickly once you placed your order.  I got the Italian sausage as my topping on the basil pesto pasta and you could see the sausage being grilled right there.  All the staff behind the counter were super friendly and did not seem overly stressed or overwhelmed by the huge crowds of people which continued well past peak lunch time.  The pastas come in a large and a smaller size which is really nice since the large size is quite generous.  All the ingredients appeared very fresh.  They also had some garlic cheese or pepperoni breads made out of their signature piata flat bread which looks like a crepe.  They also had cannoli chips as a dessert item, which were delicious.  In addition to regular soda they have a few Italian traditional sodas which was a nice together.  There is a nice clean dining area with large tables where people can eat in or take their items to go.  This is right across from my office and I'll definitely be back here!",

    "text": "We went to Piada on a Wednesday around 6:30 - and the line was nearly out the door. By the time we realized that we might not make it to our show on time, it was too late to bail. The line was slow but steady - and the staff were friendly and apologetic for the wait.   I had a summer avocado piada with extra pancetta, the balsamic salad with no red onion, and a blackberry hibiscus lemonade. I repeated this order nearly three times as I moved down the line, yet my piada did not have extra pancetta; and, my salad had the red onions on it. Had we not been running late as is, I would have asked them to remake both.  I will say that I really loved how fresh the food is here - and a unique flavor profile for the right price. It was tasty enough for me to give their customer service another shot. I will definitely go back - and hope to be able to update my review to the 4-star that I wanted to give.",

The regular size is really big and is similar, or more, than the amount that you would get at a sit down restaurant but it tastes more fresh, you can customize it, and it costs half the price. The small is a perfect option if you're not as hungry or have a smaller appetite. I've gotten both the pasta and the salad and have been impressed both times. I get fried calamari on top which is not your usual topping and it's delicious and so fresh. I hope this place expands to more locations I can see it doing great!!",

THE CLIMAX: so i'm partially enjoying my sandwich, until i take a bite of my food, which reveals an avocados from mexico sticker lying on my sandwich. my mom, like all mothers goes up and tells someone who's working there what happened. the \"manager\" (i kinda felt bad for the manager, he looked very sad and depressed) he walks over apologizes, and makes me another sandwich, and gives me a coupon for a free sandwich.  i have not gone back to piada ever since, and it is now a joke between my mom every time we go to The Block, \"you probably wanna eat at piada and find a sticker in your sandwich\"  i leave this review advising you to not eat here, and i'll also leave here saying the best thing at piada was the \"imported\" water from italy",

The Tasca was a layered sandwich (made with a thin Italian flat bread) with buttermilk chicken, creamy Parmesan + a spicy balsamic aioli, sweet pickles, pancetta, arugula and tomato. It was really yummy! I liked the spice, the flatbread was perfect, and the pickles were delicious. The chicken was only okay as it was not very crispy but everything all together was great! The bundle came with a side of corn salad and blackberry hibiscus lemonade. The salad was sweet and the lemonade was tart, just how I like it.   We arrived for lunch at 11:45 and we were able to grab a table and order right away. There was no line. Ordering was a little confusing/overwhelming, but the staff was incredibly kind and helpful. By noon, there was a line out the door and no empty tables. This place gets busy!",

    "text": "Came to piada twice now and the first time I went I ordered the carbonara pasta with the parmigiano reggiano piada stick. To be honest, Piada was so hyped up during the time that I went, which was near the time of its first opening, that my expectations were too high and the food wasn't as great as I expected. I did hear some mixed reviews on the pasta from friends who've been there multiple times before me.   This time around I came for its buy-one-get-one entree event. I ordered the summer lunch bundle which came with the Crispy Chicken BLT Tasca, a side of Roasted Corn Salad, and the Blackberry Hibiscus Lemonade drink all for $10.69. It was a great deal for the bogo because my friend also ordered the same thing.   The Crispy Chicken BLT Tasca didn't look like how it was pictured on the menu but there was a good amount of meat so we let that slide. The crispy buttermilk fried chicken seemed a little bit dry so I wished they gave more of the spicy balsamic aioli sauce. I'm not a big fan of pickles but the pickles in this sandwich were pretty sweet and really added to the flavor of the meal. Overall, the sandwich was pretty filling so I was satisfied with the portion size. The Roasted Corn Salad tasted really fresh and is definitely a summer essential side. The side portion didn't seem as much as it was advertised though. And last but not least the Blackberry Hibiscus Lemonade. Ohmygoodness it was huge!! Definitely True to its size pictured on the menu. AND it was super tasty with a nice balance of sweet & tart. So delicious~~   I'd come back for another tasca sandwich :)",

I normally don't mind taking home leftovers, but felt like passing this time because of the dry taste of unopposed carbs.   I do like the option of getting Italian food chipotle-style and did enjoy their summer avocado/chicken piada at an event where they catered in.",

I asked the other woman for hot peppers and she looked at me like i was speaking a different language and offered me sweet peppers, no thanks! Which brings to mind , how do they make calamari with hot peppers but they have no hot peppers, oh , and they were out of calamari and hot peppers. So where is the parmigiano reggiano, the best cheese in the world, used by every city in italy almost 100% of the time, sad. And the people who work there look very uninspired to work there and seem like they could care less about the customers. I would give this zero stars but thats not possible on yelp If you think this is real italian street food , you are sadly mistaken.",

It reminds me of a more upscale Chipotle serving a different kind of food (for whatever that analogy is worth..). Overall, it has the looks of a trendy/hip place, but the food I ordered was overly salted and not memorable. I would recommend for those in a hurry (although their lunch lines can get long at times) and craving something salty.  Things I liked: -staff was incredibly friendly, walked me through what is a piadina (piada) -fast, easy, lots of options to add -good portion size for the price  Things I didn't like: - I ordered a tuscan piada, and the food was incredibly salty. In fact, all I remember was biting into salt.",

    "text": "I stopped by here recently with my wife for dinner.  We were in Oakland looking for somewhere to eat whenever Piadas came up on Yelp.  Since my wife is Italian and it said Italian Street Food I figured that I would ask her what it was.  She had no clue but we decided on heading over anyways.  Upon entering the restaurant we were at first a little confused as there was a giant menu in front of us with a limited number of entrees. However after watching a few people order we realized that it was sort of like Chipotle only with Piadas or Pasta.  The inside of Piadas is actually nice and feels really clean.  There is the aforementioned line where you order and then a large dining section with lots of wooden tables and a giant illuminated  \"Piada Italian Street Food\" sign in the back.  On this day I decided to go with the summer avocado Piada which consisted of the Hand-rolled Piada filled with roasted sweet corn & tomatoes, fresh avocado, arugula, mozzarella, pancetta, basil aioli.  If you didn't look it up already a Piada is an Italian Flatbread and here they then roll the ingredients in and it looks like a burrito, hence my earlier reference to Chipotle.  In any case I rather enjoyed my Piada as it tasted good and felt like I was eating healthy.  My favorite parts were probably the pancetta which was crisped nicely and gave some salt to the dish and also the basil aioli which made the Piada less dry and gave some good flavor to it.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I enjoyed my meal and now that I've got the hang of what this place is about I think that I could probably make my Piada a little tastier.",

My best description of this place is that it's like chipotle meets Panera ... but Italian food. It's in the heart of Oakland so the staff members were all younger, as expected. But everyone was very nice. We ordered a piada, which is basically like an Italian burrito. We got to go down the line and choose what we wanted in it. And it was delicious. We also ordered a salad that seemed fresh and flavorful and fairly large. We even ordered the cannoli cream and shells for dessert. It was a very decent portion for the price! We did not leave hungry.   I also enjoyed the vibe inside. White brick walls and wood tables. They did a great job choosing the style and everything just worked well for the type of restaurant.   The most negative thing about the place is the location. Parking can be so difficult to find and it's not a quick in, quick out kind of place in the heart of Oakland. But other than that, if I'm looking to grab a decent quick meal I would definitely go back. Its not a gourmet, sit down restaurant, but for a restaurant of this nature I was very pleased!",

    "text": "Piada is one of my favorite new fast foods to go in Oakland. I am often faced with the problem of wanting something light and fast, but not wanting to settle for the typical fast foods that serve really unhealthy and heavy foods like McDonald's, Five Guys, or Popeyes. Thanks to Piada, I now have a place where I can satisfy my hunger with lighter options.   Piada has the modern vibe you find in places like Chipotle and &pizza with cleanly cut corners everywhere and simple decor everywhere. The food is created in front of your eyes, and you have tons of options to customize what you want.   I really like their pasta because it is chewy and also really thin. You get a lot of flavor out of it if you want to with their sauces, but you can also go for a lighter combination by pairing your pasta with olive oil and then adding a few veggies.   What really stands out to me at Piada is their quick service, and their ability to put together a meal so polished with little effort. The only complaint I have about Piada is that their eponymous  dish, the piada, fell short of my expectations. Essentially, it is just an Itailian burrito, except it doesn't taste as good as a Chipotle burrito. I get it, it's a different style but I felt that the piada wrapping was rough, and the things you put inside don't really mix and pair well.  So Piada is really nice for pasta, where you can customize meats, sauces, veggies to create what you are exactly feeling for lunch of dinner.",

    "text": "Ahhh, I wanted to love this place. I really did. I'm a huge fan of the \"create-your-own fast casual Italian\" concept. But sadly, it didn't live up to my expectations.   We went for dinner on a Saturday night, and despite there being only a small line (maybe 8 or so people in front of us?), it moved really slowly. When we finally reached the counter, it was loud and chaotic. I had to repeat my order several different times to several different people, and they still got it wrong in the end (I ordered a small pasta, but somehow ended up with a large).   As for the food itself, I tried the pasta with pesto, grilled chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, and roasted broccoli (for an upcharge). Sounds pretty good, right? Sadly, it wasn't. First, the ratio of pasta to toppings was WAY off (especially the chicken....very few pieces). My meal was like 90% pasta...and since they messed up my order and gave me the large size, I was up to my eyeballs in pasta. Seriously, unless you have a huge appetite or want leftovers, the large is way too much food for any single human. Combine that with the fact that there were very few toppings, and it was just a huge disappointment. The pesto sauce had good flavor, but it was very oily. Everything was also lukewarm. On the positive side, my husband got the pasta diavolo with calamari and loved it, soooo...maybe I just ordered the wrong thing? Who knows?  The space itself is nice (light, bright, and open), but it was a mess. The tables weren't wiped down and there was no ice in the machine for drinks (we alerted the staff, but the issue was not corrected the entire time we were there).  I dunno....like I said, I wanted to love this place and had high hopes (especially considering how good the reviews were), but I just wasn't impressed. Maybe I went on an off night? Regardless, this isn't a place I'm going to be rushing back to anytime soon.",

The Farmers Market salad was okay. Didn't love it but it did taste fresh and is a good salad for summer with the lemon basil dressing and strawberries.

They are genuinely kind, funny and helpful. I ordered the Mediterranean Power bowl with chicken. Ten out of ten. Pickled veggies, garbanzo beans, roasted sweet potatoes, quinoa and cauliflower topped with some kind of cilantro lime sauce- heavenly. I wish I had one closer to me to eat this every single day.    While I didn't have one on this trip, the pepperoni rolls and made to order pasta bowls are also amazing. You can't go wrong here. It has something for everyone and it's all made to order! What can be better.  Parking garage right around the corner off Forbes to make your visit easier :)",

    "text": "Flavorful, interesting, but not amazing fast food. Piada is a deli style food place that brings an American twist to Italian street food. They have strong flavors, sauces, and vegetarian options-- all ranging around $8, with additional charge for protein.   I've gone to Piada 3-4 times now, and found that their piadas (wraps with crisped tortilla) are my favorite item on the menu. Their pastas are tasty but prepared with a strange level of care-- pasta is pre-cooked, and when ordered is placed into a hot pan with sauce and toppings and mixed vigorously without being over heat. Their pasta dishes have a lot of pasta, not a lot of other substance.   In theory, having an online ordering service is great-- however, the pickup shelf is unmanned and a friend has had her food stolen in a previous visit. In addition, the influx of online orders confuses the workers on the line and you end up with frustrating delays --  in my case, I stood at the cash register for several minutes while they tried to figure out what was mine and what was someone else's.   In other words, service is slow, food is tasty, and while I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, it's a place I don't mind stopping by.  Update: Found a butt of a lettuce in my Piada, which was startling and a bit worrying re:their quality control.",

There are many different meat options to add to any piada along with fresh ingredients. I'm hooked on the Fall Avocado which is a speciality item listed on their menu. The pasta options are my boyfriend's favorite and also made to order, generous helpings, and delicious! At the end... make sure to grab a cup of the lobster bisque. You won't be sorry you did!!!!!  Do yourself a favor and go try it if you haven't already. Two thumbs up   from me.",

    "text": "Ugh, this disappointment. I didn't realize from previous Yelp reviews that this was a deli/cafeteria style joint. It plays as if it will be table service in a nice Italian place, but it's fast food.  First off, I stood waiting to be noticed by the 6 people behind the counter for a really long time. No one would make eye contact, all were busy filling salad dressing bottles or sorting bacon, but ignoring customers. It wasn't even busy on the floor. When they did finally ask if I was ready, the gentleman was extremely friendly and got my order started of pasta carbonara with additional broccoli and roasted cauliflower added.  Slopping pre-cooked, mushy spaghettini and some tomatoes that looked like pico de gallo into the bowl, they topped it with the requested broccoli and cauliflower, moving me to the cashier. Then to my utensils behind me, all very cafeteria style.  I sat at a large common table and took a bite. If you were making a hot pasta dish, you would warn the customer if the items on top were not only cold, but had ice crystals on them, right? That would have been considerate. Instead, I had a bowl of ice cold veggies sitting on a coagulated, tepid cream sauce over pasta cooked so long as to become an undifferentiated mass of lukewarm semolina sludge.  No. That meal was revolting and got thrown away.  I give it 2 stars because my colleague loves this place and eats there almost every day, so maybe I just got unlucky.",

The Piada itself was very delicious - perfect balance of crispy and chewy with just the right amount of olive oil (pretty sure?) for that fresh flavor.  However if I were to order again, I would avoid the steak which was dry and salty. I also wouldn't get the lemonade which was too sweet for my taste... But I admit I'm particular where I like to taste the tart and sour of my drink   Anyways - all in all a good and quick place to grab a bite with moderate prices ($10 for my piada) or just drop by to rest and read a book with your meal (totally did that).",

I like that you can pretty much add any kind of toppings for free so mixing and matching the flavors are fun. You can pretty much have a different set of flavors anytime you go. In addition to the Piada, I had the garlic flatbread as a side with the lemonade. It was a quite the satisfying lunch that kept me full well into the evening.

    "text": "Saw that this place had just opened this past Monday and really wanted to try it out as I'm currently on rotation in Oakland. Finally got a chance to pop in today. Unsurprisingly, as this place is currently on the rise (trending since it is new - literally it's still in its first opening week) and I went during the lunch rush (when people are usually on break, either from work or classes), the line was pretty long and translated to a 20-30 minute wait. I do really appreciate that the staff observed this and attempted to make things go faster by passing out menus to those in line and made themselves available to answer any questions customers may have so that by the time you do get up to the front to order, you know what you want for sure instead of standing there taking precious time up to decide. From what I overheard from those in line, this restaurant (chain) has its roots in Ohio and quickly rose to prominence from there. The restaurant concept is mainly based on the piada, a Italian-style type burrito that has its roots in Italy (hence the name), but it also serves other Italian-related options, such as soups, salads, pastas, and so forth. I decided to try a seasonal item called the Fall Steak Avocado Piata, which consists of a piada shell and a rather delightful combo of steak meat, arugula, pancetta, avocado, spicy balsamic aioli, mozzarella, pepitas, and butternut squash. I ended up also adding calamari to it since I wanted to evaluate its quality along with three sticks (Parmigiano Regiatto, Pepperoni, and Garlic Dough Piada sticks). The piada itself was wonderfully made. Ingredients are fresh and the combo that was included in the particular piada was well-thought out. The steak meat was cooked well, fresh, and juicy, which I really liked. I also found the calamari to be of decent quality, not overfried to the point where you feel guilty eating something potentially unhealthy but also not to the point where there is no taste to it. All in all, my mouth felt wonderfully happy and satisfied biting into the piada and all of its wonderful flavors that went well and complemented each other impeccably. The sticks were also pretty good and are excellent sides to complement should you be feeling really hungry. Overall, it was well worth the wait even if the wait was longer than I would have liked. In general, I would recommend going in the early afternoon when not so many people are on lunch break and perhaps the later dinner hours to avoid the dinner rush. The best way I could succinctly describe this place is Chipotle-like Italian style cuisine. Definitely worth a try if you're in the area!",

I got the Chef's Special piada with calamari and added onions & avocado. Absolute perfection! A great blend of spices, sauces, flavors, textures...i'm still dreaming about it now.

We all left very happy with the food we had eaten. Since my mom doesn't have a yelp, I feel like we should want me to mention that the meatballs were really really good. They have a lot of choices for different types of pasta which was cool. I don't have anything like this near me, but I wish I did, which should say something about the place. The place was really clean and to get your food is a line, kind of like Chipotle, but you order immediately when you get there and walk along as your dish is passed down the line. It was really quick as well. I liked how the people there were dressed in the cool chef outfits and I noticed that they were having a lot of fun cooking and being around each other, while serving us, which was really cool because they were all happy! They had a lot of choices besides pasta, but I would definitely recommend getting pasta here. I had pasta with pesto and chicken and it was really good.",

    "text": "Visited piada's for the first time after seeing their grand opening posts on my facebook feed. Had the chef's favorite piada with crispy chicken. I actually liked it a lot! I got a free side of a parmesan stick after showing them the facebook event that you can get a free side. My friend got a small basil pesto pasta with steak. The sundries tomatoes in there were a tad salty but nevertheless delicious. She got cannoli chips as her free side. The chocolate chip cream they gave on the side had like two chocolate chips in there which was to my disappointment. The Parmesan stick wasn't as good as I expected but the entrees were delicious. I loved my piada wrap and I loved the few bites of pasta I snuck from my friend. The steak and chicken were both really delicious. The pastas and piadas don't come with any meat or calamari or anything like that from the start. You have to add it on for a few extra cents or bucks like $0.99 or $1.99, something around there. The waitresses and chefs were all really friendly and the chefs walked around as we ate constantly asking us how we liked our food and if we needed anything we could call them. :)) overall, it was a pretty satisfying lunch and I'd most likely come back!!",

The employees were nice and it's a well kept place inside but this place doesn't have great food. The piada was mostly sauce. Way too salty, any good Italian knows when a food is too salty they should counter it with some sugar or something. Not here. I'm not sure being in Pittsburgh people know what good Italian food is, but this is nothing like what you get in and around New York. Piada falls way shorter than my semi high expectations.",

For some reason even though the base pasta price is pretty cheap, it bothered me that it didn't come with meat and to add any type of protein cost extra. Why not just include a choice meat to the base dishes, increase the price, and offer vegetarian options as well? I also didn't really understand why the piada cost more than pasta when in the end it turned out to be a lot smaller. Even though going here is fast and convenient for a quick bite, so is going to any of the 100 other restaurants located right next door. And for italian food, I'd rather just go to an actual sit-down place anywhere else around Pittsburgh.",

The crispy calamari is very good and is mixed with breaded and deep-fried hot peppers. The hot peppers are delicious, and I would pay for a side of those without the calamari. Overall I was satisfied with the flavors and the quality of the ingredients, but I felt that Piada was overpriced for the quality of food.   I discovered recently that Piada allows unlimited toppings for free. I ordered online and added several toppings, but I was disappointed. They did not add the spinach I requested. I also asked for the calamari on the side, which they have done when I ordered in the restaurant, and the calamari was mixed in. There was also hardly any sauce on my pasta.  Piada is a decent enough place if you're looking for a quick lunch, but I find it to be hit or miss. There are better grab-and-go options in Oakland.",

However, I don't see a reason that I'd go back to Piada with so many other options around.

The pastas, in my opinion, lack flavor and could be better. However, it is pretty good for the price and is made quickly right in front of you. The set up to order is similar to Chipotle as in you tell the chef what you want as you walk and there's a menu right when you walk in. The staff are all very sweet and have been very friendly while I've been there. They like to talk to you and are open to explaining what each item is when debating what to get.",

All the food is made to order which makes it that much tastier.  I had no idea what to get and wanted to try it all. I decided on 3 sides-the side salad, a meatball, and parmesan stick.  The side salad was the perfect size with iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and olives with a creamy parmesan dressing. The have a few other salad options and you can get meat added in.  The side of a meatball was served in a bowl of sauce with parmesan cheese on top.  It was about the size of a grapefruit and delicious!   To top off the meal I got a parmesan stick (basically a long cheese breadstick) served with parmesan dressing to dip it in.  Are you sensing the parmesan theme?!!  They also have many sandwich and pasta dishes to choose from.  The prices are very reasonable and I can't wait to go back.",

You can order from the menu OR you can create your own (like Subway - but way better!!).  I had the Balsamic Salad - it was so good - wish I ordered the large instead.  It had the right balance of ingredients and just enough dressing.  We got the garlic roll - OMG - if you like garlic - you'll LOVE this one.  We were full, but not stuffed when done - although it was so good - I would have liked more.  It was nice to see all the employees who were handling food were wearing gloves, they were friendly and fast.  It is a bit loud but not so you couldn't hear the person sitting next to you.  Will definitely be back!!!",

The meal was made right In front of us, and was made with fresh food. The speed to get out of the line was great as well. With all the workers behind the line they quickly get you to the checkout while offering smiling faces. I would highly recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "I was excited for the opening of Piada because it's different from anything that is in Oakland. On campus, you can get burgers from Five Guys, burritos from Chipotle, and Chinese food from many places, but you couldn't get Italian food. But then Piada came into town. Suddenly, I could get pasta without going through the trouble of making it at home.  When I walked into the restaurant, I noticed that everything looked very clean. the system for ordering food is very similar to Chipotle's. You order step-by-step; first, you choose between pasta, piada (a thin wrap), or salad; then, you choose your protein and sauce; and lastly, you choose your toppings. Personally, I like this system because it keeps the line flowing, and you get to choose specifically what you want in your meal. However, one thing that bothered me was when I was choosing my toppings, the worker asked me if I wanted the suggested toppings, and I replied, \"yes, please.\" She then proceeded to push my order along without asking me if I wanted anything added. I did stop her to ask her for more vegetables in my pasta, but in my opinion she should have asked if I had wanted anything more.  The food itself was very healthy-feeling, and the portions were more than enough. For the price, the amount that I was getting was definitely worth it. I even had some to save for the next day. The pasta to meat ratio could have been a bit better by having a bit more meat. Also, there was not enough sauce for my liking. I found the meal a bit dry as did my roommate and parents. However, when we asked for a bit more sauce, they were more than willing to give us that extra scoop.  Another thing that bothered me about Piada was the lack of seating. With the instant popularity of this restaurant, many people come to sit down and eat here. The kitchen and line take up about a third of the space, so seating was a bit difficult to find. Overall, I would recommend this place to others. Don't be afraid to ask for what you want because they are very willing to accept your requests. Be aware that the seating is a bit tight. But I did enjoy eating at this restaurant for its cleanliness, delicious food, and friendly employees.",

Last night my son, his friend and I were wracking our brains for someplace to eat, an overload of choices makes it as difficult to choose as if there were a scarcity of choices. Someone mentioned Italian. I suggested this place. Italian street food? What does that mean? Pizza? So we walked in the door with the menu right there in front of us. As more people followed in line, it was a quick decision. I opted for the Diavolo Piada with steak, rolled up like a burrito. My co-eaters chose the Carbonara and Diavolo Pasta. All great and tasty choices prepared in minutes in front of our eyes. Diavolo-spicy. Just enough spice. I greedily ate too fast. We were all full after that meal with no leftovers to take home. My son suggested the carbonara needed just a bit more sauce as his only complaint for the pasta he ordered with crispy chicken. The other Diavolo order-just enough spice there too. The dessert was tasty but nothing special. I'd probably pass unless I just wanted to eat the frosting/filling to satisfy a sweet craving. I'd love to have some lemon cream cake or some other choice. The Italian sodas, great. I'd come in just for a drink of one of them. Definitely a fan of this place that Pittsburgh was lucky to get. We plan on trying some more of their choices. Give it a try.",

They're also not as fast as Chipotle so if the line is long, expect to wait around 15 minutes to order. The interior decor is pretty artsy and well-lit so restaurant looked quite appealing. Anyways, I got a small Basil Pesto Pasta (the large is a monstrosity. Immense portions). The pasta was decent, definitely not gourmet though. My only complaint about the pasta is that it had too much garlic. Other than that, I'll definitely try the other options when I visit this place again.",

I wasn't expecting them to give me so much calamari in it since I got it for free, but they didn't skimp at all! The food is flavorful and the staff is friendly and helpful as many customers who have never been to a Piada may not be familiar with the food. Prices were super reasonable. Like many people said, it's sort of like a Chipotle for slightly more unique and casual Italian foods. I'll definitely be back.",

Just go down the line and point at what you want in your pasta.  Once I sat down to eat, the food was a little bit above warm. The flavor was good, but be careful to make sure you get enough sauce.   Portions were not an issue.    The staff was very helpful and pleasant. Really nice of them to help direct the flow for folks that had never been there before.  We'd go back to visit now that we know what we're doing lol   The Hibiscus Lemonade was amazing!!!!",

If you're going in expecting completely authentic Italian food, you'll be disappointed, but if you look past that, you'll realize that it's great!   We went in during an off hour so the line wasn't too long. We got a piada (fall steak and avacado piada) and a pasta (carbonara). With the pasta, you get to customize it, choosing the kind of meat and other toppings you want in your dish. It's kind of like a chipotle where you see the different toppings in front of you and choose. We also got the cannoli chips which were SO good. It's essentially the outside of the cannoli with the filling in a separate container. They were so addicting I couldn't stop eating them.   The price was reasonable and you get a lot of food with what you order so it's definitely worth it.  The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was very clean and designed very nicely.   I will definitely be coming again and throughly enjoyed my experience here! If you're going to go, I would recommend not going at the peak hours because the line will be a lot longer.",

The menu has around 10 basic options with plenty of meat options, as well as side options. The ambiance is very nice and all the employees were very friendly! I ordered the diavolo pasta with crispy chicken and I was very pleased! The pasta is not undercooked or overcooked and the diavolo sauce (while a tad spicy) was delicious. The crispy chicken had great flavor and a nice crispy outside. You definitely get a solid amount of pasta for the amount you pay. Overall, I'd definitely come here again to try their piadas and salads!  **Fun tip: You can also ask to add pasta in your piada!",

My BF and I got the pesto pomodoro meatball pasta with an extra meatball to share. This is more than enough for two people, maybe even three. Pasta was cooked perfectly and the taste was wonderful. We also got the pepperoni sticks which were really good as well. They come with a Parmesan sauce, but I would have rather had the red sauce with them.   I also had some of the berry Italian soda, and OMG. I'm not a pop/soda drinker, but that raspberry soda gets the gold star from me.   I could have used more pomodoro sauce for the pasta in addition to a side of pomodoro for the sticks, but that's just my preference. I also think having some house wine would add to Piada's fabulousness... again just a preference.  I will definitely go back to Piada soon!!!!",

The salad had candied pecans and Granny Smith apples that really complimented each other. My roommate got the diablo pasta which he loved as well as the avocado wrap. That was good but not as tasty as the crispy chicken BLT Tasca. It has crispy pancetta on it which makes it even better. It's a little spicy but so good. The pesto pasta was good too! Nice flavors.

I went with the summer lunch bundle- turkey pesto tasca with the roasted corn salad and the blackberry hibiscus lemonade. The staff were all so friendly and incredibly efficient. I can imagine that they can get through a pretty long line for lunch quickly. The lemonade was really tasty and the tasta was delicious! It was so fresh and just packed with flavor. The roasted corn salad was good as well. I left feeling not overly full, but really satisfied. I would definitely go back for lunch again!",

As an Italian-style Chipotle, I guess the food and service are meant to be inexpensive and fast, with many students and workers grabbing and going during the day. Lines can still get pretty long during peak hour though, so we'll probably try to utilize the online ordering system next time we head over there. But it looks like they have their system down pretty well.  In addition to salads, they mainly offer piada wraps and pastas. Having tried one of each, the pastas are okay but nothing to write home about. Just because of the way that they are made, they still have a \"fast-food\" feel and aren't too filling or savory. The piadas are a bit heavier, maybe because of the wrap itself. They come together pretty well, and it could be the amount of sauce they use to intensify the flavors. I also appreciate how you can pretty much add as many vegetables as you want, while the meats (particularly the steak and meatballs) are done just right.",

I thought that so early I'd be okay, but it definitely took longer than other assembly line type places. I think it would need to be a little faster to really work as a quick lunch place in Oakland, but if you have time, or take a longer lunch than I do, it's worth at least checking out. And maybe some of the crowds will die down once it's been around longer. New places do always get packed in Oakland.  I got the chef's favorite piada with the crispy chicken and did like it. I'd like to customize it more another time, but thought that the food tasted good. Maybe a little bit salty, but it was decent, especially since there aren't many places to get wraps around here. Once everything was put in the wrap, the chicken wasn't crispy anymore at all. It might be different on top of a salad or a pasta, but I wouldn't describe it as crispy chicken. It was just breaded and got a little soggy pretty quickly.  It was meh. I wouldn't be against giving it another shot and trying one of their salads, but I wouldn't rush there.",

The line was not to long and was able to make a decision on my order fairly fast due to the menu on the wall.  The Piada is a custom rolled wrap that is heated on a stone grill.  The wrap was good and I think the cook put some EVO on it as it cooked.  You can also get a salad or some spaghetti noodles/bowl.  The food is prepared along an assembly line just like the auto industry, or Chipotle or Subway.  Anyway, I ordered the Chef's Favorite Piada with calamari.  The calamari was an extra $1.49 which is really reasonably price.  The calamari was a little tough and OK.  The wrap was stuffed with spicy diabolo sauce, romaine, sweet & spicy peppers, mozzarella, and creamy parmesan.  Will definitely try to return and try some other options if in the area.   The staff was friendly and did a good job of answering questions.",

I ordered the chef's favorite piada (vegetarian) and my friend ordered the diavolo pasta. We both ordered a Parmesan stick.   I like how you go down the line and can add whatever ingredients you want, similar to chipotle. The process was quick and easy.   My piada was awesome! It's like a wrap but the wrap itself is crunchy and buttery. So good! And the diavolo sauce they put on it is awesome - spicy but creamy. And the Parmesan stick was to die for!! And huge. We were very pleased with the quality and quantity of our food.   The only reason I knocked off one star is the price. We got two drinks, two Parmesan sticks, one piada, and an order of pasta. But we had a bogo so we didn't have to pay for the piada. And it was still $20! No complaints on the food but I was shocked when I saw the price. I actually made them double check it. Without the coupon, you could get a nice sit down meal for that price.   I plan on returning to try some of their other menu options - and I'd probably return much more frequently if the prices were a bit lower. But overall great experience!",

    "text": "I was pleasantly surprised by this choice of a restaurant for the Oakland scene. I keep pasta to a high standard so I didn't expect too much going in, and it wasn't some crazy pasta delicacy, but it was exactly what you'd want it to be. Fresh ingredients with plenty of quick options that are different than your chipotles and Qdobas. Good when you want to switch up the lunch idea but only pay around 8-9$.   I took a little girl I mentor here and she's usually kinda picky but she liked her pasta a lot and I enjoyed mine as well. Only complaint I have is that I got spinach in my pasta and they didn't mix it up enough for it to wilt at all before serving it to me. I don't like fully raw Uncooked spinach in pasta it needs to cook down at least a little.   But I would definitely go back.",

    "text": "Interesting addition to the Oakland restaurant scene - and much needed I may add.  There is really nothing compared to Piada Italian in Oakland.  It's not fast food but it also isn't a table served restaurant so it really breaks the monotony of the typical 'college town' options. You stand in line cafeteria style but everything is made to order.  The \"piadas\" are a thin type of flat bread and you have several options for ordering. I had the Tuscan Piada which was full of flavor and had a nice creamy sauce.  I could barely finish it and was definitely full when I left.  Other options are salads and a nice array of pastas.  They seem to have nice season choices as well.   I'm glad they came to Oakland and think that people who work and go to school here will appreciate having Piada as a dining option.",

And I'm SO glad we did! From the moment I walked in and saw Italian sodas on tap I knew I'd be in love!   I got the chef's choice Piada, and it was honestly amazing. Like an Italian burrito, but so much better than that even sounds! The peppers were sensational & not something you find a lot at fast food places like this! The little cheese bread thing they add in your bag may have been my favorite part. The olive oil and cheeses were top notch, you could just tell!  Everything single staff member we interacted with was friendly and knowledgeable!  I've literally told 15 people about it already and can't wait to go back!",

The chicken and pasta was a nice addition. Something was very salty for my liking so I had to keep taking breaks. Not quite sure what it was. Either way it was a nice meal, I probably would come back and try the pasta bowls instead though.",

    "text": "Came here for the pre-opening VIP event and would definitely go back.  It's a fast casual style joint that reminds me of Chipotle - except Italian and with fewer decisions as you are going down the line.  They have a few choices each of wraps (piadas), salads, and pastas plus a few seasonal selections and sides.  The standard ingredients for each choice are listed on the menu, so you select what you want, pick your meat, and watch them assemble it - you don't need to provide further direction unless you want it specialized in some way.    The place is shiny and new - modern, but with some rustic touches to soften things up a bit.  There are several communal tables, booths, and regular tables throughout.  Staff members were super-friendly and plentiful for the event.  Smiles all around and a willingness to explain, assist, adjust that you don't find everywhere.     I ordered the fall special piada.  It was absolutely delicious on a seasoned wrap that was freshly warmed and filled with steak, butternut squash, etc.   I appreciated that the arugula was used sparingly - so often, wraps are stuffed with lettuce and little else.  The balance of ingredients was good and it was enough to fill me up without a side or anything.  I also sampled the soups, some sort of cheese bread, and the fall side selection.  The fall side selection was top notch - flavorful and hearty, but not heavy.  I didn't care for the other two, but it could have been that they were samples on a tray that sat a bit.    The other thing I didn't care for was the carbonara with grilled chicken that the boyfriend ordered.  The portion was ample, but I'm not sure \"carbonara\" is really the right description for this dish.  It was more of a bland alfredo with a bit of bacon added.  And it was really dry - the pasta to sauce ratio wasn't right.  Skip that and go with the wrap.  Add some Italian peach tea and you have a meal.",

I ordered spinach and arugula for my base, and the spinach was more of a garnish than anything. Almost entirely arugula.. I added chicken ($1.50), got extra chicken ($2.50), and still there was about 5-6 tiny cubes of chicken in my salad. Not only is this overpriced for a college neighborhood, but the salads are extremely disproportionate would have given 1 star, but I actually liked the lemon basil dressing.",

Piada has a good amount of great Italian options and you get a ton of bang for your buck! For any of you who actually portion the amount of pasta you are \"supposed\" to have; their regular bowl is at least three servings and quite tasty! They do make their \"breadsticks\" and \"pizzas\" with something resembling a tortilla shell so you won't get as much value there but I hear the taste is still worth it.  The lines are astronomical at times because this place is still novel but things move pretty fast. Near the end of the day the \"breadsticks\" (tortillas with cheese and/or pepperoni inside) won't be freshly made which was a bit disappointing but still tasty.  For Dessert, there are cannolis not to die for and don't be fooled by the marketing of Italian Sodas... taste really isn't worth the price.  Overall, this place is a 3.5 for me but rounding up because so much bang for your buck, good service, nice amount of seating and pretty tasty.",

System (and the interior decor for that matter) is very much in the style of Chipotle, Sweetgreen, and the like.  Food was ok overall. Fresh ingredients, though sauces and soups are a bit on the salty/creamy side. You can get piada, pasta, or salad to customize. The piadas are quite nice, though not blow your mind away awesome. The portion is not huge, but your meal can still get close to 1000 calories.  Price is on the high side for a fast-casual chain. Expect to pay $1-2 premium total over national chains.  Overall, this is a place for a slightly fancy office lunch. If my friend or co-worker wants to go, I'd have no problem tagging along. But this isn't somewhere that I'd visit regularly by myself.",
