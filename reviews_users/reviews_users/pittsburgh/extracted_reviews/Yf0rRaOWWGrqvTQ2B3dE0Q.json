    "text": "We went on a Friday to try the fish sandwich. I got mine with lettuce and tartar along with onion rings and coleslaw and a side of 5 garlic parm wings, she had fries with hers.   The fish was not only massive, it was good. A lighter batter than most places, cooked right, not oily. The bun held up to the end and didn't crumble in mid-meal while trying to squeeze that massive sandwich in my mouth. The coleslaw was crisp and tangy with the right amount of moisture. The onion rings were typical, no problems and a good-sized serving.  The wings were good - crispy outside and moist on the inside. The garlic was on the light side, not overpowering. Not the biggest wings I've ever had, but not the smallest either. Pretty typical.  We went a little before 5 PM so it wasn't very crowded initially but by the time we left it was filling up. I was satisfied with the service, didn't have to ask for anything that was forgotten. Didn't try any of the beers so can't speak to that.  It's a neighborhood place, expect to be called \"hon\". Makes you feel welcome. Parking is on the street and not abundant.  Overall a good experience and will return.",

Really flaky, fresh tasting fried fliets (you get two, and they are huge). Batter is light and flavorful. Tartar sauce is great.....old corner bar atmosphere in a stuck in time little hood called Etna. Definitely will return next time in town.",

The configuration is odd and maybe intimidating to a first time visitor with the narrow bar in the front and restaurant way in the back.  Food is good comfort food and portions are plentiful.  Service can be slow on weekends because crowded diningroom and lots of takeout business.  Really enjoy the reubens, fish sandwiches, and salads.  Only serves sandwiches and salads at very reasonable prices.",

    "text": "Came here two Friday nights in a row for their Lenten dinner specials - yes, the fish sandwiches are THAT good. This place was packed both nights, and the number of take out orders leaving this restaurant was crazy! I couldn't believe how much food they were pumping out of that kitchen. I'm so glad this place is close - less than 10 minutes from our house - a solid neighborhood find. The service was friendly (although a bit slow as they were VERY busy on the Lenten Fridays we were there) and our food was good and came out hot. The fish was REALLY good and HUGE portions. The sandwich comes with two giant fillets, fries, coleslaw and a bun to make a sandwich with. I also tried the shrimp platter - it was generous too and the shrimp tasted good, was hot and was crispy being breaded in Panko. It was however, VERY greasy. I think I will stick to the fish as the Lenten dinners go. We tried the fried apps as well - hush puppies, jalapeno poppers and their house made cheese sticks. All of these were just OK - pretty clearly just freezer to fryer stuff, but it wasn't bad for the price. The house made cheese sticks were crispy on the outside - not breaded. They were also just OK. Other sides we tried were the mac and cheese and haluski. The mac and cheese was almost overwhelmingly buttery - more like  buttered macaroni noodles with some cheese, rather than a macaroni and cheese with a cheese sauce that may have had some butter in it. It was just OK - it was a lot of butter for me. The haluski was also OK, but pretty tasty. Definitely worth at least one Lenten Friday trip! We will be back to try their other \"non-Lenten\" dinner options soon enough, I'm sure. Always love a good neighborhood find!",

The best way for me to describe it is like long john silver breading without any grease. This isn't something I would normally order, but I heard they were known for the fish and chicken so I had to try it. I got 5 large pieces of chicken, fries and coleslaw for $7.99. My daughter and I shared it and we still couldn't finish everything. The cost for the quantity and quality is amazing. I will 100% be back to eat the chicken.",

    "text": "The definition of an average fish sandwich. Mild in flavor, big but not ginormous, and not one hundred percent crispy yet not drenched in oil, I don't think this is the \"BEST\" fish sandwich in Pittsburgh or an amazing bang for your buck. The accompanying cole slaw and tartar were both mild and didn't add a particularly tangy flavor or or satisfying crunch.   They do have a decent domestic bar and other  bar type items on the menu like wings and burgers. Street parking outside, a decent local place, not worth a special trip.",

When I asked for cheese sauce they happily brought me nacho cheese and it was OK. A nice beer cheese dip for pretzels would have been better. Still I liked the pretzels. Fries were frozen -not fresh cut- but were OK. I'm a fry snob, so it's hard to please me there. Coleslaw was not good. We will be back and I'll try the wings.",

Fried chicken breast, large green salad with fries and hard boiled eggs.  Wonderful salad.  Definitely check out this place.",

This sounds terrible, but I actually look forward to not eating meat now on Fridays during Lent if it means Etown.    Their chicken tenders are quite delicious.  I've picked up platters of them when entertaining and they are always a hit!  There is never a single piece left, even (especially) when it's just a group of adults.  Affordable and excellent quality.",

    "text": "It's official. ETOWN may very well offer the best fried fish in pittsburgh. While ETOWN is more a bar than restaurant, it is impeccably clean, bright and NS. Service is friendly, several beers on tap and daily specials. But fried fish is their thing, and they do it right. Flat fillets fried in a crunchy batter, drained from excess grease and served piping hot with tasty french fries and a small container of house made slaw. Fish sandwiches are served on a kaiser roll.   I've been searching for Pittsburgh's best fried fish for 25 years.  I've narrowed it down to ETOWN for the traditional and Pipers Pub for the beer batter style.   EAT LOTS OF FISH....",

    "text": "Alright...so either I was here on an off day (twice) or I am ordering the wrong thing!!! Both options are very good possibilities.   The first time we went was around this time last year.  Etown is literally a 3 minute drive from my house and Bobby was interested because he thought they probably used their meats from the butcher (whom he so loved before they just closed up shop recently) and really enjoyed his burger.  I think I ordered a side salad and a burger without the bun.  I assume they were both decent, but nothing so amazing that it left an imprint in my memory.  So last night on my way home from work, I called and ordered a takeout order of 10 wings and their taco bites.  I specifically asked for their wings (which are just skin-fried and non-breaded, yay!) to be cooked well so they were extra crispy.  I got there and it wasn't very busy and the girl had my order ready to go.  I contemplated a six-pack with their seasonal beers and they had a decent selection, but I opted against it.  The taco bites were different than I expected but they hit the spot! good flavor and I didn't even need the salsa or sour cream! The wings (hot ranch) had good flavor and were extremely meaty, but they almost seemed under-cooked which was a disappointment considering my special request.  They were to the point where the skin was unappealingly gummy.  I should have thrown them in the oven on high for a few minutes to crisp them up, but I was kind of turned off by the consistency so I ended up tossing them.  I will say that I have been here to drink a couple times and it is a great little local bar.  It has a good selection of liquors and beers and the bartenders are nice and attentive. I would totally be willing to give them another shot food-wise and definitely try the fish sandwich everyone raves about on here!  I'll update my rating if it is warranted when I do so.",
