The salads were good and fresh & both dressings we tried were good. Both of our pizzas had a really strange charred taste. Upon further inspection, the underside of the crust had a black dust on it. I don't know if something was burned prior to ours or what, but it made the pizzas inedible. The have one of those new freestyle coke machines, which was a nice treat.",

    "text": "Update: Tried Blaze again today and it was better than my first experience. I decided to go crazy with the toppings and get a large amount of them. This made the pizza way better. As expected, the thinner crust had a bit of difficulty holding up the toppings, but the flavor was very good. The sauce had a nice spice and zest, the cheese was creamy, and the meat and veg tasted fresh. I especially enjoyed the caramelized onion and artichoke. The staff here is also very friendly and makes the experience personal. If you decide to come, I would recommend loading up your pizza with toppings because they come at no added cost and improve the pizza vastly.   Original: Stopped in for lunch today, used online ordering which skips the line, but they don't fire your pizza until you arrive and pay. I like this because it keeps the pizza hot and you aren't left wondering when your food will be made if you order online. Takes about 3 minutes to fire up the pie.  The price is right on for this kind of food, about 8-9 bucks for whatever toppings you want. On par with Panera, Chipotle, Jimmy Johns type pricing.   The pizza is alright. I feel like if I took a couple of trips to perfect exactly what combination of toppings made it right for me, it could possibly be pretty good pizza, but still not outstanding. I got a variety of cheeses, meats, and vegetables on top, but the red sauce was the most dominant flavor. The crust is thin, which would probably lead to it not holding up should you decide to get a large amount of toppings. I did enjoy the crispness and chew of the dough. There was a good variety of choice with the toppings with some less common ingredients like roasted garlic, arugula, and caramelized onion.  Overall, the flavor of the pizza is good, nothing to write home about. The reason you would go here instead of another pizza chain is for the amount of toppings you can get without added cost, as well as the speed for which you could get it. Might be back to try the drizzles and other sauces.",

    "text": "Friendly staff, nice & clean (opened 2 weeks ago I'm told)  I had the White Top Pizza (white cream sauce with mozzarella, apple wood bacon, chopped garlic, oregano, arugula).  Sorry but it was very bland.  Couldn't even taste a hint of garlic and couldn't even see, let alone taste the cream sauce.  The first one was burned black on the bottom. I didn't understand that you could get more free toppings (since that was on the menu board under Build your own, I didn't think it applied to the White Top.  I'm told you can get tomatoes and mushrooms which would have been good.  The second re-do came out undercooked and way too much sea salt given it already has bacon.   I got offered a free pizza coupon to come again.  I mixed the blood orange drink with 1/3 lemon at the soda area.  It was perfect.  I was told that the blood orange alone is too sweet.  I also had the Beet and goat cheese salad.  I liked that.  Generous sizes on the salads.  I might go again but there is better pizza out there.  For one, you must like thin crust pizza (so it can cook in 5 minutes).  two people in our party ordered the thick - It is not thicker, only slightly more crust at the edges.  They are very scotch at this location with the amount of sauce.  Max group seating is 6. we added a chair from another table for 7.  If 8 had been able to come we'd have been SOL since the tables are unmovable for rearranging for groups.  There are booths in the back that each can seat 6. That might accomodate 12 - 14 if you were able to et both.  We thought for being a new place it would have been busier in such a well traveled shopping center location next to Panera, movie theatre, grocery, etc. Decor is industrial lighting, seating, orange elements, a bit rustic.  Is that trendy? Average bill with pizza, salad and drink $15",

If that's the case, why did your website let me place an order and why did it charge me a delivery fee and take a tip?

Now that I got that out of the way, It has a chipotle-like feel to me, from the menu to the selection options to the industrial style seating. For $7.95 you can make your own pizza with as many toppings as you want.    If you're the type of person that doesn't want to look at all the toppings and pick what you want, they have specialty pizzas (FOR THE SAME PRICE) already made up for you. They have different sauces, cheeses, meats, and veggies. At first I thought it was a joke, but if you can build it they can make it!  The first time I completely overdid it with the toppings. I want ALL the meats, no veggies, sprinkle that salt and oregano on there and give me a couple of drizzles on that bad boy.  I may have only eaten like 2 slices before I was completely full!  They also have another \"upgrade\" option of getting a thicker crust for $2 more, which I am an absolute fan of!  Thin crust is cool, but the thicker one just tasted heartier to me. Ok, now let's talk size.  My husband and I can share a thicker crust pizza with as many toppings as we want.  I'm serious. There is NO REASON to order 2 pizzas between the two of us (unless you don't like the same toppings and don't want to split one). The three times we have been here we both have NEVER eaten our entire pizzas - NEVER. Oh, and I never thought I'd be a fan of sprinkling a small amount of salt over your pizza before it cooks, but it makes it taste like heaven in dough form!  Drinks - they have a typical soda machine, but they also have various lemonade flavors, which some are absolutely delightful, BUT some do taste like that artificial sweetener stuff, so taste at your own discretion.  I like to mix my lemonade with a bit of sprite to give it some extra zest. I wish they had 7up or ginger ale, but a tad of sprite gives it a nice zesty punch taste.  There isn't any alcohol served here, but it isn't that type of establishment. They want you in and out.  I've tried this place twice in two weeks, and me and my husband have a dinner date with friends on Friday to go again! Yes, I said dinner date, and YES it's going to be at Blaze! The atmosphere is just comfortable and the food is good, so why not?",

The topping line up is also superb, offering 5 different cheeses, tons of veggies, and over 6 different meats.  The lineman was new and was so nice and let me make each half of my pizza different.  Also, the manger was super friendly and the place was very clean. I will be coming to Blaze for a long time.",

The lemonades are very good too! I recommend the original.",

It's nice that they have a gluten free crust and vegan cheese, but the GF crust was lacking. It was very thin and too crispy- I like my pizza crust thick and chewy. The toppings were disappointing, too. They put like 4 tiny pieces of chicken on the entire pizza, a tiny amount of cheese, two leaves of spinach, and a small amount of peppers. The pizza had minimal flavor and was not what I was expecting. I'm sad to say that I didn't enjoy Blaze as much as I wanted to.",

I can't think of a time I didn't get the spicy red...it's pretty awesome and not too too spicy.   If you want cheese, they have it. Want lots of toppings? They have those too. On a diet?

Pros:   you can get virtually whatever you want on a personal pie for around $8.   obnoxious vegans can rejoice as their crust is vegan and they have vegan cheese service has always been most excellent wood fired pizza gives pizza crust the BEST texture (you're just wrong, Chicago)  Cons:  I'm not sure they season anything.  Sauce is bland, toppings are bland, and crust is flavorless.  Sad day.   yes, it's a personal pie for $8 but I always have to get two to feel full because regardless of how much I top that thing, it's never filling.  Double sad day.   On paper, the pros outweigh the cons, however those are two mega big cons.  The food just doesn't have flavor and you walk out of there still hungry if you only order one pie.    This place is great if you're held up in Barnes and noble all day studying and need a bite, but don't expect killer pizza and don't expect to be full.",

The concept is neat, not original, but still fun. Choose your crust, your sauce and then toppings. Or just tell them to make one of their pre chosen pizzas and they'll make it fresh. Process was simple, toppings seemed fresh, lots of veggie options, and decent selection of meats. Price is great for the amount of pizza you're getting. Pizza did take around 15 minutes to fully cook, but it was a fresh pizza made from fresh dough and toppings so it's as expected. Definitely will return and I recommend it for sure.",

Sauce is not sweet, had nice fresh tomato and herbs flavor balance. Nice quality meats and cheese. Thumbs up!  You are in charge of how much of everything goes on your pie at Blaze. I was asked repeatedly if there was enough of an ingredient as the staff made the pizza.   They bake the pizzas in a very hot oven. You can see it all happen and it doesn't take long.   All good. Will be a repeat customer. Great value too.",

They have an efficient process up front in taking your order, assembly, paying, etc. A very loud and nice guy calls your name loudly when your pizza is done so you can pick it up. I say he was nice as he walked around to the patrons to check to see how everything was. Plenty of seating. Most importantly the pizza was good!! Sauce was tasty, dough was excellent-I even ate the crust. Ingredients were fresh! I would highly recommend!",

This is a build it yourself pizza restaurant adding whatever you WANT AND AT NO ADDITIONAL COST FOR TOPPINGS!   The manager Gary assured her they take gf very seriously and would take precautions.  Gary personally made my pizza. He changed gloves, used a clean area preparation away from the other pizzas and baked it in a clean oven area. The topping ingredients used were untouched by the wheat pizza handlers or they were taken from the back that were not in the assembly line yet. He personally was the only person to touch my pizza. They were very friendly taking extra care for gf and cc was not a problem. The pizza was amazing! I did not get sick! While eating I saw another celiac customer place an order and he took special care to prepare hers also. I look forward to eating there again!",

Better yet you get a fresh baked pizza in around 180 seconds. If you like fresh toppings they have it all, I'm talking numerous meats, tons of vegetables, and more types of cheese than any other pizza shop I've been to. Sauces and finishing drizzles to add even more depth to an already delectable self created masterpiece. My pizza was cooked perfectly, crust nice and crispy, and didn't flop over when I picked up a piece to eat it. I'll definitely be back, my wife even wants to do a movie and Blaze for Mothers Day.",

The salt, bacon, and basil were the only noticeable flavors. The rest was very bland. They hardly put any white sauce on it at all. The other toppings were fairly sparse and not distributed evenly. The chicken was pre cooked stuff like you can get at the grocery store. I found the employees to be friendly.

The crust is thin and crispy and the toppings are fresh. They build your pizza right in front of you; you can put as much or as little of anything on your pie. If you're gluten free, they have a gluten free crust for you. You also have the option of ordering online so you can just zip in and out. They have a separate area where they keep online orders, so you can just grab and go. It only takes a few minutes for your pizza to be made anyway though.

We tried the White Top (which had a white cream sauce, topped with mozzarella, bacon and arugula), BBQ Chicken, and the Green Stripe (which was topped with chicken, roasted red peppers, mozzarella, arugula and drizzled with pesto sauce). All of the pizzas are very thin crust but you do have the option of getting thicker crust. The pizza was pretty delicious and for a quick meal, we rated this 4 stars! I would definitely go back!",

Particularly, I love that Blaze offers minced garlic, fresh basil, and ovalini mozzarella as options.   The pizzas always come up piping hot and perfectly baked; the crust is thin, yet crispy.   On a recent visit, I discovered that they offer Matcha Fresca, which is absolutely delicious! The matcha flavor shines through clearly and the drink does not contain too much sugar (it is only 30 calories per serving).  Also, compared to other Blaze locations, I find that the line here moves quickly and efficiently. I'm impressed by the responsiveness of all the employees here: they really work hard to keep the line moving.",

    "text": "#1 tip to my yelpers at Blaze - CHECK IN BEFORE YOU ORDER!  Each time I've been at Blaze, when I check in, I get an additional free pizza which makes it such a great deal!  The pizza here is pretty thin crust and a full pizza is just about right for one person if you're hungry.  If you just need a quick snack then it's also great to split.  There are some already thought up combinations or you can go down the line and add your own ingredients.  You can also start with one of Blaze's topping combos and customize them to your liking.  Here's what I've tried so far... White Top - MY FAVEEE!!!  White, sauce, bacon, mozzarella, garlic...what's not to love?  Highly recommend. Meat Eater - peperoni, crumbled meatballs, onion, mozzarella, red sauce.  Good, but not my favorite.   BBQ Chkn - grilled chicken, mozzarella, red onion, banana peppers, gorgonzola, and bbq sauce drizzle.  Surprisingly good, it may sound like an odd combination but everything together really works.  Another tip is that at the end of the adding your ingredients, have them put a sprinkle of sea salt and herbs on your pizza.  They don't overdo it and it just brings out the flavors that much more.  Definitely give Blaze a try for a quick and casual tasty meal!",

First, let me comment on the interior. It is clean, lovely and there was good, neutral music playing while I waited for my pizza to be finished. The employees--every single one that waited on me from the start to check-out were friendly, accommodating and patient despite this being my first visit. I like how the first guy who asked what crust I wanted said, \"think of this as a Subway for pizza when you build your own.\" Yes!  The pizza didn't take too long at all and it had a perfect crispness that I love as well as a delicious flavor. They offer a good amount of different sauces, crusts, cheeses, toppings and finishes (think olive oil). There are also specialty pizzas you can order that also sound tasty. In addition to pizza, they offer 2 sized salads, a few desserts and drinks. I'll definitely be back! Bravo, Blaze!",

I really like Blaze because their gluten-free crusts are among the best I have had. And the ability to either customize your pizza, or order one of their standard offerings, is great.  In Pittsburgh, I chose the Veg Out option -- fresh vegetables included broccoli, camelized onions and more. It was delicious, ready for pickup at the time I ordered it, and the staff was friendly. When I do travel, I like to check out non-chain restaurants. However, Blaze Pizza will be among the few go-to chains I will visit whenever possible.",

Most of the time they just slap ingredients on all in one spot just to get you out quicker. Wh order the vegan cheese, they put 1/4 of the amount of regular cheese - it's not fun having to keep saying \"more\" just so you have enough vegan cheese to cover the sauce. They never ask if you want to finishing items but will put them on if you ask.  Update: don't offer vegan cheese if you don't want to actually put it on a pizza",

I've ordered the red vine twice and it is amazing!  The bbq chicken pizza is also a good selection.  The drizzle just the right amount of barbecue sauce, so it's not overwhelming and doesn't take away from the other savory flavors.    The crust is always uniform, well done and crispy. It's made fresh, as you can watch the cooks rolling dough in the window when you get in line to place your order.    The menu boasts probably, a dozen specialty pizzas, or you can create your own.  I'm definitely trying the Caesar salad with my pizza for my next trip there.  It looks delish covered in fresh, shaved Parmesan cheese.   We noticed the vegan cheese last time, so they offer vegan options as well, if that's what you're in to.  I highly recommend this franchise. Even if the line is long, the wait is not.  Check it out! You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Came for a weeknight dinner! Had a few hiccups with the service, but the staff was polite and the food was still good!   We entered the assembly line area - there was no line and the restaurant wasn't too busy at the time. Since we were first time visitors, we walked up and down the assembly line to check out the ingredients. We knew the general premise of the BYO pizza but wanted to see what the options might be. After a minute or two, we were confused as to how to order and no one had come out to help us, so we walked up to the cashier area. Someone who had been in the back then came out to greet us and directed us back down the assembly line, where another worker met us halfway at the salads.   We wanted to try a bit of everything, so we picked out a salad, which the employee packaged and took up to the cashier. We didn't realize that the pizza was supposed to be ordered earlier as we had been directed to about halfway down the assembly line. So we were directed back to the beginning of the line to begin constructing the pizza. Luckily some customers behind us were asked if it was their first time (which it was), so they got a summary of how to order and we were able to figure it out from there. Looked like we just had some bad luck in coming in when no one was there to greet us.   Anyway, we built our pizza and went to pay for it and the salad. They told us to take a seat and wait for our name to be called. After a few minutes, we saw that people were actually waiting up by the checkout area for their orders, so my boyfriend went up to wait. After some more time, he noticed that one of the pizzas sitting to the side in a box and and asked if it was ours. Turns out it had been packaged as a pickup by mistake, but we grabbed it to eat back at our table. By then it had definitely cooled off a bit, but was still tasty.   Overall, minus the hiccups, the pizza was better than expected! The dough and sauce were good and the toppings were fresh. A great deal for the size and unlimited toppings! The salad was  also a good portion for $4 - I had the arugula, cherry tomato, roasted peppers, and mozzarella salad and it was a great balance of all ingredients! The concept is once that we enjoyed, although given the hiccups, it may not be our first choice for dining in that area.",

    "text": "Blaze Pizza gets 5 Stars for the combination of quality and value. Thanks to everyone's suggestion, we checked in on yelp for the free pizza with the purchase of a regular priced pizza. Delicious thin crust pizza for two people for less than $10 - that's crazy. One pizza should be enough for a single person if you're hungry.   We chose to go with a couple signatures since this was our first time, but you can certainly BYO (build your own) by choosing any toppings you want. We went with the Meat Eater (pepperoni, crumbled meatballs, red onion, mozzarella, red sauce) and the White Top (white cream sauce with mozzarella, applewood bacon, chopped garlic, oregano, arugula). All of the ingredients were fresh - I loved the tomato sauce, just gave the whole pizza a great vibe.  Their process helps to keep the crust crispy for you as you wait for your pizza. Once the pie comes out of the oven, the pizza is rested on a cookie sheet before cutting. If you hate getting soggy pizza as your first bite, Blaze does a good job of minimizing that for you.  As far as chains go, this gets my thumbs up!",

The kids running the show were more interested in socializing than paying attention to the customer. They would ask \"anything else?\" then look away to talk to their coworker without waiting to hear my response. After a very frustrating trip down the line we finally got out pizza (poorly thrown together and skimpy on the toppings). To top it off both my husband's and my pizza were burnt along the edges. I'm glad we don't live around here because we will definitely be sticking to our Monroevile location.",

Customer service is key and every single employee has given us a positive experience. Epscially the chef (bing) who always makes sure our pizzas are PERFECT. The managers really care about your experience and even remember you as you become a regular (as do most of rhe staff). Pizza, salads, desserts, yummy lemonade, and pop...

I got the spicy sauce with mozzarella, goat cheese, pepperoni, sausage, ham and banana pepper rings, amazing. Then fast fired in their oven to perfection. My wife got a veggie pizza and son got pepperoni. Both also very good, since I stole a slice of thier pizza too. The best part is for how amazing this pizza is, it's only $7.95.

The build your own pizza is my go to because the ability to add a trough of cheese to your pizza without the staff even blinking an eye is awesome.

This past Tuesday I walk in and I am digging the setup. I started my order and they took the coupon and I went down the line adding ingredients. Before they put it in the oven I ask one of the ladies how long it would take because I had to run to the store really quick. The lady told me it takes 25 minutes until it's done. I told them I would be back in 15 minutes (which I was). When I got back I didn't see my pizza. I asked them where it was and they had no recollection of my order. I also want to include that it was not busy. I told them I was told it would take 25 minutes and they straight up laughed at me. I felt so embarrassed and was so upset that I had no choice but to walk out. All in all, after the service I received, I will never go back there. They were disrespectful and no person should have to put up with that.",

Interesting to see the pizza press that presses the dough.  It is cooked for 180 seconds. Had a spicy red with pepperoni, sausage, banana peppers, pesto finish.  A thin crispy crust was good, not soft in the middle and not doughy.  The sausage is a sweet style & not my favorite but still a pretty good pizza that did not take to long for a fast lunch.",

I was impressed with the helpfulness of the staff and the pizza came out really quickly.   The pizza was a great size and really good. It was cooked perfectly and the toppings were great. It wasn't mushy in the middle which can sometimes happen with pizza.   I also had the mint lime agua fresca which was soooo good. It was nice to have options other than classic fountain drinks.   A special shoutout to the manager who checked on us and was super friendly. He clearly cares about the business and the customers and it left a really good impression on my. Prices were also very reasonable for what you got. I'll be back!",

You walk down the assembly line as you tell the folks what you want on your pizza.  They throw it in the oven and call your name when it's done.  All said and done this was a much better experience than my last visit to the Vegas location.  I'll be back again one day.",

They have a large variety of toppings to pick from and that is something I was happy to see. I decided to build my own! For my dough selection, I went with the high rise (which is somehow less calories than the original thin crust). For the sauce, the white cream was a no brainer, as I was going for a mediterranean style pizza. The remaining toppings I added are as follows:  fresh mozzarella, grilled chicken, artichoke, basil, red pepper, kalamata olives and a balsamic glaze. You can add as many toppings as you want and it will cost you $7.95 regardless. The pizza's are also the perfect 6 cut size. This is a great spot to grab lunch if you are in the area! If you see a line, do not let that turn you away. They will have the pizza's out within 180 seconds so you can get your grub on. They also have an online ordering option if you really want to get in and out fast. Also, make sure to check in on yelp to get the buy 1 get 1 free pizza offer!",

I'm all about the toppings and many pizza joints do not have options that please me, but Blaze does!  They even have a vegan cheese option.  My daughter get's a traditional pizza with cheese and pepperoni that looks and smells awesome!  My pizza ends up looking like some sort of veggie dish topped with arugula and balsamic drizzle - awesome to me!  Plus they always have beverage options that are outstanding (not just pop and water).  The beverages change but some have been vintage lemonade, blood orange lemonade, matcha agua fresca, blueberry hibiscus agua fresca and a coconut agua fresca.  You can also order via your phone app and avoid waiting in line.",

Not a single one of the 3 pizzas I got were cut. Without a doubt one of the most incompetent group of people I've ever met, time and time again. Like I should've kept to the first time I said it, I won't be back.  The pizza is fantastic, some of the best I've ever had. The issue is the staff. The owner seemingly only hires unfriendly young adults who manage to make you feel like you ordering is an inconvenience for them. I'm not expecting a \"Hey, how are you?\", but there are a few that won't even speak to you unless it's to swipe your credit card and then they promptly dismiss you. Great pizza, great concept, really poor hiring.",

Sounds wonderful right? Well I had looked up the menu prior to arriving, and had in mind what I was going to order. One of the Simple Salad options was a Kale and Quinoa option. Listed online, however they have removed it from their menu. Say what?? Disappointed from the get-go. Second, I wasn't expecting pre-made salads, especially when this place appeared to be all \"create your own\". The Caesar Salad was nothing to write home about, with large chunks of romaine ribs making up the bulk of the greens. As for the pizza? There was absolutely no crispyness to the crust and the two toppings we got were meager portions to begin with, with several slices not even having toppings on it. On top of it all, the tiny pieces of chicken garnish one of my slices tasted anything but fresh.   Well what saves this place from being a lower rating was the staff. They were exceptionally friendly, thorough with explanation on the process of BYO pizza (we were newbees), and a staff member was ready to clear our table and provide boxes in an instant. I couldn't have enjoyed their hospitality more, except for providing a better product than what they had to offer.   Bottom line- Blaze Pizza is a very cool concept that fails to execute. If a friend requests to go here, I would not say no; however, I will not willingly be back anytime soon.",

We went there on a Friday night and seemed to beat the rush of mostly families coming in to grab some pizza.   The ordering process is similar to Subway/Chipolte but it's a little more intimidating. They have a variety of pre-made pizzas that you can choose to order which is what I ended up doing. Maybe next time I'll create my own but this seemed like the better option for a first timer. I ended up ordering \"The Green Stripe\" it had pesto, chicken, roasted red peppers, mozzarella cheese and arugula. It was amazing! Chris ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and loved his as well. Another thing I loved at Blaze was their drink options, I was obsessed with the mango agua fresca! I will 100% be back to Blaze when I'm looking for a quick and easy pizza!",

I couldn't believe how crazy the crowds were (the lines wrapped all through the restaurant all the way to the back), but I shouldn't be surprised since the pizza price was such a deal.  This place is like the Subway/Chipotle of Pizza.  You basically choose how you want your pizza, pick a crust, sauce, cheese, and what toppings you want, and then it is fired in the oven in a pretty fast manner, and then you eat it.  On the two previous visits I was pleased with my pie, and today was no exception.  Gotta give some kudos to the crew, they kept the lines moving in a timely manner, and every person working the line was pleasant and courteous even though they were super swamped.  On a normal day you get a pizza with all the toppings you desire for $7.95, and today was even better since it was only $3.14.  Happy Pi Day!",

Even better as they had a Yelp special, 'buy one, get one free' when checkin-in with the Yelp app. I was there by myself and didn't need two pizzas but decided it was a great thing to eat one there and take one home for later.   As I ordered the first pizza, I asked the worker if he could confirm they had the 2 for 1 special. He stared at me and said \"I have no idea\". Really? Hmmm, my mouth open, a few seconds go by, I said, \"well, could you check with someone that may know?\". Manager just happened to be behind him, so she confirmed after worker asked what the Yelp special was. We moved on.  When I got to the cashier, I showed her the Yelp special and let her know I would be using that phone coupon. Cashier agreed and everything was fine. I got my two pizzas (which is why I cannot give less than three stars, PLUS I luv Blaze and have always been a big fan!). Well a couple of days later I was going over my receipts and noticed I was charged for two pizzas instead of one. I called and talked to the manager, let her know what happened with the first employee, then again the second mistake at the cashier. I explained due to the mistakes, the two workers may not have been properly trained. It was minimized, no prob. We agreed she would correct after talking to a higher manager working in a different market, took my number and said she would call back. Well I never got a call back, but fortunately I checked my credit card online about a week later and I was indeed credited the amount.   A few suggestions to management: your staff may need a little more training, which is why these mistakes happen. But the bigger problem is you don't want your employees responding \"I have no idea\" when a customer asks a question. It's unprofessional and just another way of saying \"I don't give a sh*t\".",
