I went there (by myself) to watch the pens game. I got a great little table but was pretty much ignored by my server. I had to ask to order another drink and she never brought me water after I asked. I planned to eat and have a few drinks as the game went on but I left before the puck even dropped. I could understand if they were totally crowded but they weren't which made it nice, but the cold shoulder drove me away. The HBK Sandwich and Moscow mules were great though.",

A few menu favorites include the signature Primanti Bros style Cajun chicken sandwich and the baked Italian hoagie, in addition to the chicken salads and fries. Their pizza is also good. Tonight I branched out and tried the Primanti Bros stile colossal fish sandwich and it was out of this world. The fish was twice the size of the bread and the breading tasty and just the right amount.",

    "text": "Primantis is a Pittsburgh iconic restaurant known for it's huge sandwiches that are loaded with fries on soft Italian white bread.  This is not my typical kind of place that I chose for a meal (hence the 3 stars), but my family loves it here, so I gave it a shot.  The atmosphere is loud and crowded!  LOUD!  The decor is very typical chain restaurant/ bar style with Tv's around the bar for sports enthusiast, booths and some flexible seating for larger parties. Nothing fancy. It does have a nice size outdoor seating area which is hard to find in this part of town.  Service was quite slow but very friendly.  It was crowded, but my table of 4 ordered 3 appetizers and 1 sandwich and we were there almost 2 hours.  Not a great place if you are in a hurry (we were not, but the wait did get annoying).  I ordered a beer and found the selection to be pretty good.  If you like greasy, unhealthy, huge portions of bar food, you will love this menu.  There are some salads, but don't even try to stay on a diet here.  This is definitely a \"when in Rome\" kind of experience.  I do have to say that I totally enjoyed my fish sandwich, but could only eat half of it.  Took the other half home.  Would give it 5 stars.  The loaded nachos were not loaded with much of anything.  Some cheese, a little bit of chili and a dollop of sour cream.  I didn't try the other plates that came to the table (cheese fries and boneless wings), but my family didn't take home any leftovers, which was over half of the food.  If you love sandwiches stacked a mile high with meat, slaw and greasy fries, this is a must try in Pittsburgh.",

I've been back tiwce since graduating (one in February from my last review) and once in July, when I brought my bf. He had heard all about the famous sandwiches, so he wanted to try one.  My buffalo chicken sandwich wasn't quite as good as last time, and he was underwhelmed with his after hearing the hype. So, I think we'll leave it with 3 stars.  Not the best restaurant, but not terrible, either.",

But nowhere on the plate to put it all. Ugh. Once I got  to the meat, I found it dry and bland. The sandwiches literally had only 3 slices of meat! Pastrami, capicola or salami sandwiches were very sparse on the meat. Plus there's no Italian hoagie! Nope! Really!? No pizza by the slice.  I expected more than glorified bar food.",

    "text": "So our friends from VA wanted to return to Primanti Brothers, which gave me an opportunity to try their pizza in personalized 4-cut form.   Tomatoes, ham, and bacon filled my required quota of 3 toppings (as per the menu) for the pie, and I found its chunky sauce to be robust, its cheese to be akin to gossamer, and its balloon-edged cornmeal crust to be killingly crisp and chewy. Primanti's excels at their signature sandwiches as well as pizza.   Chaperoning my pie was a salad dressed with a fantastic sweet/spicy clash of a honey dijon dressing, and speaking of salads, I finished massive Kay's Carribean Chopped Salad for her. Grateful for her full stomach, I eagerly ate up the remnants of it. Sweet corn kernels (!), cubed cucumber, roasted red peppers, smoked cheddar, a corned beef-ish bacon, and flatiron-grilled chicken breast cavorted on a UFO-wide plate underneath a terrific and tart mango dressing.   Shared for dessert was their BIG Brownie Sundae. More like a pliable sheet cake than a brownie, it came topped with the usual hot fudge, vanilla ice cream, and a whipped cream that may or may not be Cool Whip (it looked to be piped on). Whether or not this is made from scratch in-house, I don't know, but I at least didn't mind eating it.   Primanti Brothers may be going national, but the homogeneity usually associated with chain restaurants has yet to take hold.   P.S. The funny, personable, entertaining, good-natured, and wonderfully \"nebby\" Michelle provided us with service that was nothing less than outstanding.  P.P.S. This location was previously the Lebanon Lodge and was known as Bimbo's (????) in the 60's and 70's. The building itself was erected sometime in the 1930's. Some of the old design features remain.",

Also, they were some of the smallest wings I've ever seen. Very disappointing. It is a pain to get in and out of this location for me, so I didn't want to have to go back about this.

If I could give it a negative five stars I would.    1) bartender who thought she was straight out of the Jersey shore and too good to wait on people SUCKED beyond belief.  Nothing but attitude the whole time we were there.  Part of my meal never came out and she never checked on things and when I tried to flag her down was ignored. Poor service.  I was still charged for this item and since she would not wait on his, when I paid, I even made note of this... I saw her read it... and still no apology for sucking.    2) with so many TV's, we found it ridiculous that they would not put on the Ravens/Bengals game.  I am a Steeler fan, but their season is over, and since the Ravens and Bengals are going to the playoffs it would have been nice to be able to watch this.  We even asked the manager... we got a NO, that the Steeler game would be on everything minus the one TV that would have Red Zone on.  Why have NFL Sunday Ticket I am asking then?  You have people coming to your establishment to spend money to watch a game, and you pretty much tell them to F off and follow it up with changing the TV's for some other people?  Klassy, Primanti's.    We went here because it was where friends wanted to meet us... we will NEVER be back.  This was the final straw for me.  No matter what, even if I am craving one of these sandwiches, I cannot continue to patronize a place that has such poor customer service, rude employees and is not even that good (with the exception of the occasional sandwich).",

Now, for those few of you who have never been, or are from out of town - this is basically a sports bar for families. We counted something like 18 televisions that we could see, and we couldn't see the whole place.   While our drinks came in glasses, I've been in branches where they came in paper take-away cups.  It's not fine dining, but it's very good at what it is.  I had a bacon, egg, & cheese, which sounds like it would be weird loaded up with tomatoes, that delicious vinegary cole slaw, and fries, but was wonderful.  I also had some fried zucchini which was crisp and zucchinilicious.   With evil plotting, I also ordered two cheesesteaks to go.  Now, they're currently calling them \"Pitts-Burgers,\" which is nuts, because the 'steak' in the cheesesteak is more meatloaf than burger, but whatever.  The waitress said they've always had more than one name, but I've known them as cheesesteaks since there was only the one shop in the Strip.   Anyway. Because I wouldn't be eating them until the next day I asked for the slaw on the side. The waitress also suggested I get the tomato on the side -- genius!   When I unpacked them from the fridge the next day I opened the little tubs of slaw and found the tomato slices on top!  A little nuking, some quick re-assembly, and *poof* almost as good as fresh.    The shop seemed handicapped accessible, although I did not try the restrooms. Staff was friendly and helpful.   All in all, a tasty and pleasant experience.",

The fried were spicy and hot as well they had peppers and melted cheese on the top of it, it had the perfect amount of fries mixed in there.  I ordered the corn beef sandwich for my main course i guess and it was huge and amazing I loved it, it was full of corn beef and had coleslaw loaded with fries and it came out almost immediately after we finished the sides which is perfect time.  For our drinks we both ordered the sunk ducks and it was humongous and mixed perfectly and it came with a small rubber ducky inside of it.  The service was incredible, I believe we she was actually a hostess but she couldn't get the waitress or waiter to serve our table due to it being extremely busy so she took care of us and she did amazing she was fun very nice and she knew everything about the menu which is good for us because my fiance had Aton of questions.  All in all this was a great experience. Great waitress great food and great atmosphere. If we are in Pittsburgh again we will be back for sure.",

We went on a Friday night around 8:30. It seemed pretty busy but we got seated right away. My boyfriend and I ordered a beer and our sandwiches. I always get capicola with cheese. You can't go wrong. But when our sandwiches came out they were not hot. They were only slightly warm. I didn't say anything, though, since I was really hungry and just wanted to eat and get home. The sandwich itself still tasted good but it would have been a lot better if it came out hot. The service was okay, nothing special, nothing terrible. But I'm not sure if I will be back to this location since I have had better experiences at the other locations.",

No biggie since it's Saturday night & there was a Pens game on. They sat all 4 of us in a small Booth next to the bar. It was pretty cramped, as my husband & his friend are both husky fellas.   It took forever for our waiter to come over to say hi and get our drinks..... And such a long time to get our beers! We finally ordered. It took a little bit to get our food... A flat bread and wings. The food runner brought over our food. We finally saw our server and flagged him down to ask for a side of ranch.(which we never do because it's rude, but he had been nowhere in sight for some time.... not even at his other tables). He brought the ranch quickly and asked if we needed anything else. That was the last time we even saw him until it was time for the bill, at which time he asked if we needed anything else and dropped the checks when we said no.   I used to work at a different Primantis and I really feel like the quality of the food has gone down hill & the prices are ridiculous. My hubby got a bucket of 24 wings and they were incredibly tiny and over cooked. We couldn't tell the server that though because he never stopped by our table to ask how everything was! There wasn't a manager in sight at all.   Plus side..... We were in good company.... And the ladies room had framed pictures of good looking actors and models lining the walls, which was pretty funny & great at the same time..... Plus the restroom was clean.   Don't know if I will be back any time soon (I can go elsewhere for better food for the same, if not lower, price).",

I asked for a Miller Lite, as she gave me a sample of a local brew called IC Light, and told me it was the special of the day. I liked it so I went with that. For my appetizer, I got boneless honey BBQ wings. They were amazing! Then it came time for my sandwich. I got the Capone. It was capicola, pastrami, Italian sausage, provolone cheese, Cole slaw, and fries. Normally comes with tomato also but I got it without that. Delicious!! The people who recommended this place didn't steer me wrong! The manager came and struck up a conversation with me about baseball since I was in town for the game. He shook my hand, said thanks for coming in, and made me feel welcome with open arms. I'd recommend this place for great food and great people. Definitely a place I would come back to if I'm in town again! And I hope I can come to this location! Thanks for a great meal!",

I do have to say they have an excellent happy hour with half price pints that goes to 11:00 on a Saturday night. They also have a nice selection of craft beer on tap.  Our waitress was also very friendly.  If I lived in the area I would probably only go back for the happy hour.",

Being in good spirits always goes a long way in having a great time at a sports bar.  And a great time we had!  Two of us had the personal pizza. Their crust is the best. It is simultaneously crunchy and chewy.  The beer went well with it too. Another in our party had a classic primanti's sandwich which he devoured. This is a newer building so the layout is nice with enough room, natural light, and many HD tv's. The noise level was slightly elevated which heightened the sense of good time.  The only downside to this location is getting out onto Rt 19.  Sometimes turning left toward Bethel Park is not possible due to traffic.",

Upon arrival in the steel city, Primanti Bros is always the first place I ask to go to. I always get a Pitt-burger (the classic) sandwich, love the combination of sweet and salty between the cole slaw and french fries. I went to this particular location yesterday when I was in town for a family reunion. We had a large group of 10-15 people and had to sit at separate tables. There was a fantasy draft going on, and the restaraunt was packed. Our waitress, Michelle ROCKED! She was outgoing, quick to take our order and refill our glasses, and able to split separate checks between a loud group that was composed of several families at three tables. Thanks for the excellent service!   Also, this time I tried adding egg on my sandwich and it was BOMB!",

A thick layer of almost warm fries and about one ounce of pastrami. Seriously took the sandwich apart to try and find the meat with no success. I cannot believe this could be the norm but the Mt Lebanon location was a True bust. If you go order pizza unless you desire a greasy, meat free sandwich",

My cousin came from Toronto and I wanted him to experience Pittsburgh! Lucky for us, the pigs fly sandwich was back for a limited time. We ordered one of those and a Pittsburgher (#2 best seller). If you're wondering what #1 is, I was told that it was the beer. The food came out pretty quick.  We really liked them, I preferred the pigs fly over the Pittsburgher due to the egg and bacon. All their sandwiches come with fries and coleslaw on top. One thing that I wasn't a fan of was the coleslaw.  Although I love coleslaw, their coleslaw is a bit sour and I prefer them a bit sweet. Their sandwiches usually run around $7 which is pretty affordable. Overall,  we had a good lunch as our waiter was friendly and the atmosphere made us feel as if we were in a cabin.",

For the low price of $7.99, one receives a delicious half pound burger with choice of cheese and toppings, plus a generous order of Primanti's great french fries.  Couple this with the 9:00 p. m. to 11:00 p. m. happy hour where one can receive a glass of fine house wine for a mere $2.38, and the case is made to come to Primanti Brothers virtually every time my wife and I dine out after a Pittsburgh Pirates game (as well as coming here at other times). The restaurant excels with service as well.  Server Michelle, who took care of us on Saturday, September 13, 2014, is top-notch in every respect as is our good friend, Matt R.  The servers are somehow able to hear the diner above the frenzy that one can count on at the bar on Saturday nights. It is rare that one does not receive attentive, friendly service here. Residents of the area are fortunate to have an exceptional restaurant like Primanti Brothers in their backyard!",

However, I went here on a Saturday evening with some friends for dinner and drinks and I experienced the absolute worst service I have ever encountered at a restaurant in my life.  We get a table and wait about 20 or 30 minutes before we decided to be proactive and find a staff member to wait on us. Mind you, in this time I waited for a waitress the time on the drink special ran out which is why I was there.  One waitress finally comes and she doesn't even says nothing about our wait she is just cold and rude.  She puts our food order in and gets mine completely wrong and didn't even bring out my friends order, we had to ask someone to go get it for her.  Once we get our checks, she ignores my friend who is practically waving a credit card in her face every time she walked past.  She had to get to work and looked around the whole establishment trying to pay her bill!  When I  was ready to leave the cold and rude waitress comes a sing us about our friends bill and made us wait for an extra 15 minutes so the staff here could deal with the problem.  I finally speak to a manager who apologized and bought us our drinks he was cute and nice.  But bottom-line I waited in this restaurant an hour longer than I intended because every aspect of the restaurant was broken for my visit.",

There's a variety of sandwich options: salami, roast beef, pastrami etc... but all of then have fries with a coleslaw salad inside. Most sandwiches are really inexpensive. Around $5-$7. The wings here are also really yummy. They aren't breaded but are pretty meaty.   I love this location especially since there's plenty of parking and good for families. The inside is a typical dive bar. There's a bar in the middle where you can watch the Pens game or whatever sports game is on. There are larger tables/booths inside.   It's not 'fine'' dining but definitely good food if you just want to grab a bite to eat at a casual restaurant.   I ordered a sangria here and it was HUGE. However, the taste was just so-so. It felt like the ice watered down the wine too much. I wouldn't order cocktails here.",

First, they were very responsive to emails about reserving space for about 25 people.  Management helped me negotiate any dilemmas, including calling ahead a partial order so some food was ready for the kids close to our arrival.  Also, they allowed me to drop off a large Costco birthday cake the day before and hold it in their fridge for nearly 24 hours.  When we arrived, they had set things up in a back room to be \"party ready\" with a special table for the appetizers, and later, a special table for the cake.  The two waiters who worked with us were very attentive and rolled very well with the chaos that can come from a 4-year-old birthday party!  Finally, the whole experience was VERY affordable.  Let's just say I have spent almost as much taking my girlfriend out to The Cheesecake Factory as I did making 25 people happy here.  While the food here (and generally all Primanti Bros.) is always a solid 3-4 stars, the experience they provided my family and our guests hit 5 starts yesterday.  If you are looking for a good place for a kids' birthday party, I suggest here!",

I check for any specials to see if something new is interesting. Sometimes they do have something neat to try and then I get it until they stop carrying it. My favorite thing to do though is to get a regular lamb gyro. But instead of getting it on pita bread I have it put on regular Italian bread like the rest of their sandwiches. It tastes SOOO much better this way.  The greeters are always really nice. The servers are usually really good too. Casey is a doll and real sweet. A few others do great jobs too. One, really, really tries, and is really nice. I have a couple of problems with one order one day and have heard a couple of complaints about them. But they normally make things right when it is all said and done. But I did hear one customer who was really upset about it and talked to the manager to get their meal for free. I understand their complaint but think they made FAR more of it than it needed to be and they should NOT have asked for the manager to cover their meal. It just was NOT that bad at all.  Some days I catch them at the right time and my food comes out really quickly and is always quite tasty. Other times the wait seems to be about average for the staff and customers there at the time.",

I had the Pittsburgher, which they list as the #2 most popular item. This is a burger on their signature bread with slaw and fries in the sandwich. I got double meat, so there were two big pieces of beef. The sandwich doesn't come with anything, but it is so filling you don't want anything with it.

On entering we stood at the door way for almost five minutes as a lady kept walking past with no greeting. Finely a guy comes over who was maybe a manager or someone other than a normal server seats us in the back corner right next to the kitchen doors. So next we wait another ten or fifteen minutes and again finely someone decided to approach us and greet us after walking past a couple times. And he's not even our server he says he's running other tables and gets us drinks and forgets straws and lemons but takes our order and walks away so then we wait for that. Waiting still to meet our actual server as we wait almost twenty minutes for our food. As we are sitting here I can see directly into the kitchen and a cook behind the line with his green hat backwards and headphones in and a navy blueish shirt on is clearly eating food with no gloves on while cooking. Like how is that ok? That's a huge issue with food safety and health regulations but clearly no one seems to care as he continues. Our server ended up being a lady named Casey. She came by twice once to give us food and once to give the check. I'm so disappointed in the service we received during this trip and it's disappointing and a huge turn off with the staff eating behind the line while cooking. I really hope another guest has to sit in that spot and watch like I did.",

Fans love the fries and coleslaw on the sandwich. I opted for the Caribbean Chopped Salad which was fine but not something l'll be dying to come back for. Pretzel app basket comes with nacho cheese and 2 different types of mustard. The pretzels were nice because they weren't fried and actually not bad.   Our server was quick and polite. Prices pretty cheap. Three of us are for $40 including 4 beers (during happy hour). Cleanliness was average with nothing terrible but we did walk through spilled fries to our seat on the way in.   The atmosphere is nothing special and just reminds me of any chain restaurant. There is nice patio seating though, TVs with sports on and lots of beer options.   If you love the sandwiches or think you might, then definitely check it out, otherwise, I think there is better places to eat.",

We got the bacon & cheese sandwich and the salami and cheese sandwich. We both ordered sides of fries with cheese. Everything was great, service was quick, and food was amazing. We never get tomatoes on ours, but the slaw and fries combo is perfect with basically any of their sandwiches!   Ps.. the Primanti size fry is huge!

Our waitress was so good and on top of everything.  She even stepped away as our kids gave their Mom a card and present.   The food was good and is the standard Primanti's which we enjoy but I do realize not everyone wants fries on there sandwich.  We started with some wings that were good and piping hot.  I had PB Rueben, that was really enjoyable and not to many calories, lol.  All in all, a fun place to celebrate.",

We waited probably a half hour and nothing. I didn't think Primanti's took that long but you would think our wings would've came out first. Nope. Our waitress never checked on us or gave us any updates about our food. People that came in after us got their food and everything.   Finally the kitchen staff brought our food out - all at once. Literally everything was luke warm or cold. I'm not even exaggerating. It had to have been sitting back there the whole time. I have no idea why it was so hard for the waitress to not wait on us - as I said before, it wasn't busy! There were four tables being used and everyone else was at the bar.    We were extremely disappointed, as we were looking forward to this meal. We will most likely not be back to this location.",

    "text": "Every time we visited Pittsburgh we had to go to Primanti's. It's tradition right?!? Now that we live here we figured it's no different.   The first time we went, we had a horrible experience, however the new manager James (I think) was super cordial and took care of us. What surprised me the most is that our food runner of all people was the one who stopped back to check on us and made sure everything was ok. When we expressed our concerns she was apologetic and eager to remedy our situation. If it wasn't for her professionalism and her going out of her way to assist us and demonstrating superior hospitality, I'm not sure we would have gone back any time soon. We didn't see our server much and he seemed too busy to be chatty, so at the end of the meal we had a conversation with the food runner and found out her name was Legacy. She told us she was a server and we vowed to ask for her the next time we came in.   Well, unbeknownst to me, I ended up back at Primanti's the very next evening when my Aunt called and invited us to meet her and her family for dinner. I of course asked for the sweet girl who helped us the night before. There were 6 of us and we were high maintenance always needing a drink refill, more food or something. She handled our table with the utmost ease and never missed a beat. It's SO nice to find a server on top of her game like that. She singlehandedly created a table of regulars!   Also the food was amazing! It came out fast, hot and cooked to perfection! I really enjoyed the nachos and wings! I am looking forward to all the weekly specials and happy hours in my future, not to mention games! Go Steelers!!!!   Thank you and keep up the good work!!!!!",

    "text": "This place is a solid 3.  I've been here several times, and I'll probably visit again.  Here's my take:  GOOD: - It's quite big.  Lots of tables.  Bar is huge. - It's got a neat feel inside.  It's a very old lodge, converted to a restaurant, so there are big, wooden beams in the ceiling, a giant stone fireplace, and some cool animal heads on the wall, staring at you while you eat. - The food is consistent and good.  The big sammies are just like the ones in the Strip District. - The menu is LARGE, with lots more stuff than they offer at the original location (e.g., entree salads, wings, pizza, nachos, burgers, etc.).  NOT SO GOOD: - The parking lot is not quite large enough to accommodate the large size inside.  And given the location, there are no street-parking or other alternatives.  If you can't park, you can't eat. - The floor and some of the booths are just a little STICKY!  Is this place really that clean?  Mercifully, it's dimly lighted, so I can't really see what might scare me under good lighting... - Some of the servers act like they'd rather be elsewhere.  Others are good.  Hit or miss on service.",

    "text": "A great Primanti Bros. to go to if you don't want to drive into the city! I absolutely love the atmosphere in this location - it has almost a cabin feel to it. And the best part, there is rarely a wait to sit!  The staff at this location is always super friendly and quick. I actually enjoy the food at this one over other Primanti Bros. locations. I usually just get the bacon & cheese sandwich with an egg.  The only downfall to this location that I want to point out - it is noisy and a little cramped in spots. The last time we were here, we were sat right by the front door, with their arcade golf game right behind us as well as the bathroom. People kept walking past and a group of 5 kids decided to play the arcade game, so it wasn't ideal seating.  Overall, I 100% prefer this location over city ones. No wait, great tasting food, and the staff is quick. No complaints!",

    "text": "So (and I'm probably going to be stoned for committing a sin after admitting this) I still have not eaten at the original Primanti's. Sorry, guys! But I have eaten at the one in Oakland, and now, I've eaten at the one in Mt. Lebanon near where I live. The last one is the one I'm reviewing today.  And, well...it's certainly not bad. I'm probably a bit biased because there were some major problems the night I was there. In fairness, the restaurant itself is quite nice. It's spacious (MUCH more spacious than the one in Oakland), clean, and most notably it's decorated in an odd and interesting manner; for example, there's a Steelers scarf wrapped around the neck of a mounted Elk head in there. The scarf I get, but...really, an elk head? In Pittsburgh?  The food is delicious, of course, although not something I would eat all the time - way too much fat and salt. (Would we ever expect anything else from Primanti's?) I would definitely prefer to have all of my Primanti's meals here, though, due to the additional seating space. Plus, there's the extended menu that includes foods like gyros and other sandwiches, which I know aren't typically available at other Primanti's. I definitely prefer the expanded menu here - I even ordered a gyro off of it during this visit. Sure, I get that Primanti's is all about the french fries and coleslaw covered sandwich, but it's still good to have the other options, at least to me. I think it can make a first-time meal at Primanti's a lot less bizarre and even more enjoyable, especially for out of towners. In this case, my friend wanted to eat at Primanti's for old time's sake since she used to live here, but I didn't particularly want a Primanti's sandwich that night, so I got my gyro instead; my friend got her sandwich, and everyone left happy.  Well, mostly happy. There's a reason this place is just \"a-ok\" to me. My problem has more to do with the fact that the service my friend and I got during our dinner was very mediocre, and this is a complaint I've heard from other critics of the place as well so I doubt it was just me. Our server failed to bring us the water we ordered when she brought our other drinks, and we ended up eventually getting it after asking a third time - long after our food and alcohol had been consumed. She then never came back to check on us after that, and so after an hour of just chatting (which admittedly my friend and I didn't mind, we were catching up after not seeing each other for four years), we ended up grabbing another waitress so they could find ours.  I'd give the place 3.5 stars if I could because they're better than \"a-ok\" but they're not quite at the \"yeah I'm definitely a fan\" level, either. It's worth going here if you're nearby and you have the time. The food is definitely what you'd expect from a Primanti's, and perhaps it's even better thanks to the menu additions. It's just the potential service delays that may put a damper on your experience here.",

    "text": "What can I say about Primanti Bros?!  This is the place that most chefs, restaurant owners, bar owners, management, and servers need to study if they truly want to work and SUCCEED in the restaurant industry.  If you're in doubt...  Try to park - the parking lot is usually overflowing.  But you will still get seated faster than any other place with a line.    We come here when we are sick of Pittsburgh's (really just South Hills') jackass attitude on customer service and low-brow outlook on food quality.  Primanti Bros relaxes us with ICE COLD BEERS - no matter bottled or tapped, and treats us with BIG sandwiches that are CHEAP but never lacking on quality nor quantity, and provides the absolute premium example of FIVE STAR service worth our time and money in Pittsburgh.  We leave loving Pittsburgh every time (that good!).  GO STEELERS!  GO PIRATES!  GO PENGUINS!  I would go as far as to call Primanti Bros the In-N-Out of Pittsburgh, a must for every visitor.  On one occasion, we went two nights in a row, almost three!!  Heck, I am going to go again this week, because I am craving the experience after another shitty day of smart ass attitude and zero help - this time just trying to get my damn bicycle fixed at a \"Pro\" Bikes.  A week to replace chain, tape, and tires for a 30 minute to 1 day job (if busy).  That would be an equivalent for waiting a week to replace your windshield wipers at a dealership.  Pittsburgh.  South Hills.  Yuck.  But no waiting nor BS servings of poor attitude is to be found at Primanti Bros!!    Primanti Bros doesn't just have daytime beat.  The bar at night still scores just as high as daytime hours with excellent service and top quality food, past most other \"bars\" kitchen closing times.  The Walnut Grill for example was our first choice - went in and ordered drinks - the chairs were raised onto the tables hours before actual closing time - kitchen closed although the wrap-around bar and a few booths were seated with many parties - we had to go get the server to serve us and go get the server to pay even though it was not busy at all - and then we left, walked back to our house and went to Primanti Bros to actually eat and drink more!! Walnut Grill lost a lot of money on us and will continue to lose money to Primanti Bros because of that lazy, late eat-out night.  Not to mention the food quality is super inconsistent there - how hard is it to make edible nachos and serve them hot every time!!?!  Very hard apparently.  What do I order every time I go to Primanti Bros?  The Pittsburgher, because I can not get enough of it - go for the double to really satisfy your needs to be nurtured by your food.  We have brought guests here and sure they were not happy with an order or two for whatever reason that annoys them, but guess what?  NO ATTITUDE, servers take it with a smile and a new sandwich comes out, and they return with a smile!!  And the guests return to having a great time.  PERFECT.   You want a sports bar?  YOU GOT IT.  A TV at every angle for you to comfortably watch TV.  The only thing I don't like is the fact that they sell t-shirts like it's Joe's Crab Shack!  I shouldn't have to go to a touristic place to get good, basic food and ice cold beers in Pittsburgh, but I do and really do not mind one bit!  TAKE MY MONEY!!",

Service has always been good/very good to both my wife and I. Either at a table or at the bar. They have a pair of twin sisters that work behind the bar who are very good at what they do and are always friendly. We choose to sit at the bar at least half of the time because of them. Considering some of the patrons they have to deal with sometimes, it's remarkable they maintain their consistently good service to their customers at the bar.  The restaurant is almost always very clean, and that includes the bathrooms. Parking is great, although pulling out onto Washington Road is a little tricky when leaving while rush hour traffic is still in affect.  Overall, a four-star place for us. Remember, it's Primant's, not Eleven in the strip. You're in, you're out, and if you get there on the right day of the week, the bartenders are great. What else do you want from a beer and food hangout??????",

Ask to sit far away from the bar if you want to actually focus on your companions, not on the score. Great place to hang out when the Home Team's on!",

Primanti's is known for their sandwiches which have coleslaw and French fries ON them. It sounds weird but tastes delicious. You have the crunch of the coke slaw and the saltiness of the fries which gives the sandwiches a lot of flavor.  Primanti's also has pizza and wings. The pizza is really good with a great balance of cheese and sauce.  If you are visiting Primanti's is a must try!",

The waiter we had (Matt) was an awesome dude who explained everything to my sometimes picky parents to a T. He gave some solid recommendations and wasn't overbearing or intrusive.  Anyways. We got some wings as appetizers, 5 Spicy and Hot, 5 Buffalo Ranch - both solid. Recommend. Wings were good, had enough meat to them and the sauces were both on point.  We ordered a Roast Beef and Cheese, Cajun Chicken, and Pitts-burger. All were fantastic and more than enough food. Fries and coleslaw on a sandwich is what made me leary of Primanti Bros at first, but it really made the sandwich.  Couldn't have been more satisfied with the waitstaff, the kitchen staff, the food, or the atmosphere. Great first Primanti Bros experience, I hope it carries through the other locations!",

We took friends from Virginia here last weekend, and they loved it and can't wait to come back! I tried a sandwich with fried fish on it, and it was actually pretty good! This time the fries were crispy, and the slaw was a little sweet as well as tangy.   The insides of this one are really cool and resemble a hunting lodge. It's clean (especially the restrooms) and spacious also, very much unlike the Strip District version.   Our server was polite (also unlike the one in the Strip) and was very patient with my friend who has lupus and comes to Pittsburgh for treatment (her illness makes her lethargic and her brain foggy at times).   In addition to the sandwich, I liked the pecan pie which came with awesome whipped cream (it wasn't from a can), vanilla ice cream, and was served in a large portion. They even have really good dill pickles. You get a whole one cut into fours per order!   Give me this family-oriented version of Primanti Brothers anyday.",

    "text": "As a Pittsburgh transplant, the fascination with Primanti's always seemed a little ridiculous. The sandwiches are okay, but they're hardly good enough to overcompensate for their lack of quality service, and pure arrogance that I've experienced from their staff.  This particular location is the perfect example of how Primanti's thinks that living on \"Pittsburgh legend\" status is enough. Why should they provide decent service when your seat will just be replaced by some other fool looking for a sub-par meal because it's \"famous?\"  We only agreed to meet our friends at Primanti's because they advertise that they have NFL Sunday Ticket and we assumed that they'd actually show a variety of games...you know like every other bar that pays for the service. With our group made up of two Steelers fans, one Ravens fan, and one Eagles fan, we were hoping to be able to watch all of the games, but despite this location having a ridiculous abundance of televisions, we were denied the ability to watch the Eagles/Giants or Ravens/Bengals games. We were told that the Steelers would be on all of the televisions, and one TV at the bar would be turned to RedZone, and that since RedZone shows highlights of all of the games, that should suffice. This was coming from the manager, nonetheless! Thanks, man...thanks for not even trying to help your customers out. God forbid, not every one of your customers cares about the local team. Especially at a touristy spot. We saw 3 Ravens fans, and a Texans fan...all roaming around trying to find a TV with their games on. But, hey, they can't possibly change the channel on one of their 50 TV's.  Meanwhile, I look across the bar and we realize that one TV was turned to the Falcons game for ONE fan in a corner booth. Another TV actually had the Giants/Eagles game on it, but that, too, was in a corner booth and the only person who seemed to be watching it was our friend...who was forced to squint to watch from across the bar.  So, in the end, the manager and bartender both contradicted their \"policy\" of only showing the Steelers game. Too bad we couldn't get any reasoning for their decision.  As if that wasn't enough, the service at the bar was laughable. The bartender acted like customers were bothering her when we wanted a drink or to order food. She didn't get our order right, either. So to round off a horrible experience, we didn't get to watch our games AND we didn't get what we ordered, despite being charged for the things they didn't bring out. No apologies, no positive customer service, and nothing but arrogance coming from both the manager and the bartender.  It's a good thing their name will keep the money rolling in, because any other restaurant would be out of business with Primanti's level of service. We definitely won't be back.",

Let me just say, for the record, carb on carb action is not really my thing. Frankly, french fries and sandwiches aren't really my thing. So together it was definitely scary.   I sat at the bar for a late lunch. The staff was fine but mostly disengaged. I had an order of wings with the garlic parmesan sauce and a pittsburger (get it?) with an added egg. The wings were actually pretty good. I liked the sauce and it was fun to try something totally different compared to regular wing sauce. They had many other options of sauces that I would consider returning for.   When the sandwich came out I could barely see the meat as it was overwhelmed by coleslaw and fries. Once I'd scraped off half of each of those to make it more mouth acceptable I noticed that the meat was pretty small compared to everything else going on here. And that it bore a concerning resemblance to a mcdonald's 'meat' patty. Hmm...  Frankly, even if I liked french fries or sandwiches I don't think I would have liked this rendition. The french fries were, weirdly, simultaneously soggy but also a little undercooked. The patty was gross. I ended up leaving much of this behind. I even tried to drown it in ketchup but it still left me feeling kind of gross. The rest of the day I felt a little queasy. Not really a good experience.",

    "text": "My love affair with Primanti's goes back to my first visit to Pittsburgh. After a red-eye with a stopover in Detroit in the middle of December and a devastating 4-1 loss to the NY Rangers, I made my first ever visit to Primanti Brothers for a sandwich and beer. The little restaurant in Market Square welcomed me with open arms, beckoning my southern self out of the snow and into the world of their signature sandwiches.  A few years down the road, I made my second visit on the way back from a job interview. Primanti's greeted me like an old friend, tempting me with Yuengling (I was living in Texas at the time) and cheese-filled comfort. Upon my move to Central Pennsylvania, the visits continued and the locations expanded. My order never changed (hello, one vegetarian sandwich!) and the quality never waivered.   Soon after I started dating a Pittsburgher, we discovered a Primanti's only minutes away from his house. It was fate. Yes, definitely fate, if not fortune. It has become a weekly ritual for me to roll into town Friday evening after a 2-hour drive and ease my troubles at a wooden table with a big mug of beer and a slaw-filled sandwich. The service is always great--every single server and bartender I've encountered at any location has been laidback, genuinely friendly and attentive. They don't even judge the boyfriend when he burns his tongue on hot-out-of-the-kitchen pizza/fried zucchini/fried mushrooms/you name it.  Service was a little slow on our last visit--a busy Saturday night with lots of sports on (forgive my ignorance--I only follow hockey.) Drinks came out quickly, so I had no problem with the wait for food. Our fried mushrooms arrived and my date and I glanced at each other uneasily--they were still cold in the center. No worries, though, we'll just ask them to stick 'em on the fryer for another minute. The manager was on the floor helping out the servers racing around to serve an abnormally large number of large groups and caught wind of the slip-up. He had already stopped by to apologize for the wait and bring more drinks, which was more than kind as it demonstrates the high standards of the restaurant.  Sandwiches came out and we devoured them as usual. The manager surprised us by comping both of our rounds of drinks--totally unexpected. We would have gladly paid for everything since we were not upset or concerned at all about the mushrooms or the (not too long) wait, but he and our server assured us that they were committed to making sure guests had a great time and making it up to them if they didn't. WOW! Way to show customer appreciation!  And that's why I love Primanti's.",
