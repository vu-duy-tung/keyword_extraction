I do agree that the interior can be crowded, and that the majority of the patrons are typically affixed to their laptop screens.  I give 61c props for outdoor seating (in the spring/summer), delicious homemade granola, and the best blueberry cheesecake that you've ever had. The blueberry variety is made in-house, and is incredibly substantial (I am a total whore for cheesecake). Remember, 61c is cash only!",

It is named after the bus route which stops outside the front door (the 61C bus route...).  They have a large selection of coffees and loose-leaf teas. They have lots of great home-made baked goods. The Ginger Snap cookies are the best I've ever had. It is the only coffee shop where the DEFAULT is \"for here\" mugs...people who get drinks \"to go\" are looked at strangely. Go with your laptop or a newspaper and get out of the freezing (I mean FREEZING!) cold of the Pittsburgh winter and enjoy this place.",

The only downside is that they only accept cash, but in case you forget, there are atms down the street (or just go to Giant Eagle). Metered parking is available nearby, but you might find some free spots farther out in the neighborhoods.Or just hop on the 61C bus - it will drop you off right in front of the shop!",

Yes, the cafe may seem a little hipster (it is), a little grad school (it is), and a little granola (it is). But don't let stereotypes deter you; 61C is a pleasant experience.

People talk their shit about Starbucks, but they've at least some structure and a higher level of customer service (most, not all).  It was raining on this particular day in Pittsburgh. It was humid but I was still in the mood for a delicious mocha! I yelped local coffee shops and came upon 61C Cafe. It was a cute joint - everything you'd imagine an independent coffee shop to be. Cute and quaint.  The barista, however, was incredibly rude. I had greeted her myself, and all she could muster up was, \"yes?\" I ignored it and ordered an Almond Mocha. She quickly steamed up some milk on the counter (not from the fridge, mind you) and POURED in the mocha and almond syrup into my cup. What happened to all your pumps? Talk about inconsistency! I should have asked for two pumps each to really have messed her up!  I don't know how she did it, but she made no eye contact with any of us throughout the whole transaction (and we ordered 2 more drinks on top of the almond mocha!). What's wrong girl? You need me to pet you?  I was so exhausted with this girl, I couldn't even enjoy my beverage. It only takes one person to really mess up the whole experience.  61C Cafe, have some standards and check up on your staff. The beverage quality is abominable.   And BTW, your cookies are awful, too.",

Coffee is about 50 cents cheaper than Starbucks and they have the cream and sugar out so you can help yourself to as much or as little as you want. I've recently started trying their fresh juice. It's really cool, they cut the fruit right in front of you and squeeze like 4 or 5 pieces into your glass. If you don't like pulp stay away from the juice though, because being fresh squeezed tends to lead to lots of pulp. Kind of expensive though, $2.75 for a small glass.   The crowd seems a little hipster-like, but not really pretentious or engaging in ridiculous discussions that make them sound smart, but in reality they know nothing about like hipsters are sometimes known to do. Pretty chill crowd here and everyone has always been friendly.",

But, I had to share my experience here because I've never experienced something like this before. I have been to the 61c once or twice for the smoothies cause I think they're tasty. Each time I ordered a smoothie I got a lot of attitude from the barista. When I went earlier today the barista literally rolled her eyes and scoffed while making the drink. She seemed overwhelmed by the amount of people coming through the door and I am sympathetic to people being overwhelmed or stressed out- but don't make people feel uncomfortable. As someone who has bartended and served tables, I would never give someone attitude for ordering something. Like I said, I've never reviewed a place before, but the barista that was so rude to me today prompted me to review. I don't have anything against the establishment as a whole, but the baristas are often flustered and unfriendly and I think that is unfortunate for the owners of the place that may be well intended people. I understand people have bad days and have things going on outside of their job, but being overtly rude to a customer is not going to help your day get better.",

It's definitely on the more affordable end of the Squirrel Hill coffee shops, and is much quieter than either of the Starbucks or the center-of-the-grad-school-universe Commonplace Coffee, so it has that going for it. It also has a huuuuge assortment of different coffees that they get from all over the world. The house blend, the Sumatra, and the Ethiopia are delicious, the Brazil decidedly not.

Each small table was occupied by one person with a laptop or a book. I came in with a friend and felt slightly uncomfortable just talking. It was just dead in there.  I went to the counter and said that I wanted a smoothie but I wasn't sure what kinds they had. The girl behind the counter stared at me. Ok, so I found this board that had smoothie ingredients on it and tried to figure out what I wanted. I ventured to order and was told that I had to pick something from each column. At this point the girl behind the counter actually turned her back on me. What the hell? Why do I feel like I'm taking some kind of smoothie aptitude test. Just tell me what is going on. So, to the back of this girl I say, \"apple\"... Apparently this completes some requirement that my previous order hadn't fulfilled and another girl starts putting apples in the machine.  At this point, I think that while I don't plan on coming back, at least I'll get a nice fresh treat to take out and ponder the wackiness that was my experience. Nope. The first girl opens the fridge only to tell me that they are out of the other ingredients I had asked for. Whatever. I'm actually glad I got out of there without spending any money.  I don't know if she just didn't like the look of me or what, but if you don't like serving food to people you probably shouldn't work at a cafe. Also, if your smoothie ordering process is even slightly unclear, it wouldn't hurt to help a customer out.  I don't doubt that other people have had better experiences here, but the dark, solitary atmosphere and terrifying service won't be bringing me back in the foreseeable future.",

I would not put them in the same class as those in Portland, but in the context of a city Pittsbugh's size and located in the mid-Atlantic, I'm impressed.  Came to 61C based on a couple recommendations.  Very cool place.  Seating is a bit tight, but then, coffee shops struggle sometimes with relatively low turnover and low priced items, so I don't mind the sardine-packing atmosphere.   The positives: decent number of wall outlets; nice selection of teas, sustainable to-go containers; good selection of sweets; friendly barista; great location on the Murray Ave strip in Squirrel Hill; fresh veggie/fruit juice available; very cool music.  The negatives: Lighting could be much better, especially in the back away from the windows; no design to speak of, very plain tables/chairs, and a ceiling badly in need of painting and repairs.  One hopes that the 61C bus line doesn't get relocated or cancelled...",

    "text": "Awkward but okay.  61c is a cafe with an identity crisis.  The seating, a blue grid of cramped narrow paths is awful and totally fills the space, I mean, seriously, get a couch or maybe a table with more than two seats.  Just weird.  I feel like getting to my seat is a game of pac-man.  Given 61c's utilitarian, classroom, look, I assumed that the angle was that it was a no-nonsense wifi type cafe, but really, if there are no outlets, where do i plug my computer in?  It seems like there were once outlets but maybe they have been passively aggressively covered with blank wall plates?  I don't get it.  The coffee and other pastries are acceptable and slightly above average, but seriously,  do something about the awkward room.",

    "text": "So I hosted a little 1-hour Facebook battle of asking my friends one simple question:  \"Who has GREAT Coffee?  And if you say Starbucks, I will smack you!\" A lot of great suggestions came up; however, a friend mentioned 61C Cafe and because of it's close location to my apartment and was the one place I hadn't been to before, I chose this place.  However, before you go - CASH ONLY!!!!  That being said, on with the review! What a great suggestion 61C Cafe is because of my one criteria:  GREAT coffee, was met!  I do consider myself a Foodie, but I consider myself a Coffee SNOB!  Yes - I like my coffee hot and black, without the bastardization of sugars, creams, syrups, and foams. When I pulled up - I immediately liked the exterior as it looks like an old coffee shop from the 60's.  But upon going inside, it's very warm, cozy, and simple.   No schticky decorations or fake histories on the walls.   When I ordered a large cup of Dark Roast, they were actually at the bottom of the caraffe, so the barista asked if I wanted it, or if I would be willing to wait for a fresh pot.  (Duh!  Coffee Snob!  Wait for a fresh pot!) I took a seat and started reading a book while waiting for my coffee, when the barista brought my coffee over to me a few minutes later and said with a genuine smile, \"You can pay when you're ready!\"  I paid $2 for a LARGE CUP OF COFFEE!!!  $2!!!  AMAZING!!!!  I tipped him another $2 for being so awesome! Another great thing about this place, the clientele are awesome too and are not pretentious, too hipster, or too trendy.  Just people drinking coffee, passing time, and reading books.  When I asked my table neighbor to watch my bag while I went to put another quarter in the meter, when I returned we actually had a great conversation! I didn't get a chance to taste the biscotti or the baked goodies, but definitely on my next stop.  Great coffee.  Great Atmosphere.  Great People.  Great Prices.   JUST BRING CASH!  :-D",

    "text": "I'm so relieved that someone else noticed the fact that the tables are arranged not like desks in a classroom. I thought I was going crazy...coming in I saw maybe 15 people sitting down at 20 little identical tables, *all* in front of laptops...nearly all facing the same direction. All I could think was \"This must be what coffee shops in re-education camps look like\". (It's not *that* bad- and they have more traditional seating in the back; I think this is just how they've had to adjust to crowding.) Because of that, it took me a few minutes after taking myself to really feel comfortable.   I had a tasty (and cheap, albeit small) pot of tea and sat down facing the opposite direction, just to be contrarian. Their wifi was free, which is a big plus, but they didn't have good power outlet access, which is a big minus. The staff was friendly, the selection of teas was phenomenal, but the music was just a bit too loud (and at some times, flat out awkward) for my tastes, and all in all, it just didn't quite click. I had gone there to get some reading done - I was able to get it done, which was good, but I didn't feel the desire to linger around once my work was done, which was bad. All in all, asi asi.  I did see someone there reading a seminal paper in ubiquitous computing, so I have to vouch for the crowd (sorry, nerd pride). And the desks are actually well suited to getting serious work done (I imagine a big plus for a lot of people, given the number of laptops). But for me, I was really hoping to find a cozy place to escape the world while being productive - and for that, I'll have to keep looking.",

The name of the shop and the facade was intriguing. It seemed like a cute and cozy place to enjoy some caffeine.  The employees were all young college students. They were working on school work at a table next to the counter and it took a few minutes to be acknowledged but after they did realize we were there they were very friendly! Two of them helped us out, rather than just one, which I thought was surprisingly efficient of them. And the interior is gorgeous, minus the dark lighting.  Now, onto what matters. I ordered a simple vanilla latte and a peanut butter chocolate chip cookie. I'm not sure if they make their baked goods on site or if they get them from somewhere else but my cookies was delicious and pretty big for the price! But the latte was a different story. It was very small and although I ordered something simple in hopes that it would come out fantastic I was let down. My latte was burnt and I don't even think any vanilla was put into it. My boyfriend got a small coffee, which turned out to be a very very very small coffee. And no refills.  All in all it was an okay experience, but who burns a latte?",

If it is nice out sit in their sweet little outdoor courtyard and enjoy the wildflowers (beautiful sunflowers sprout every year) and watch the bustle of the heart of Squirrel Hill.",

This made me wonder - it's pc to support local indie businesses over chains, but chains seem to get the customer service thing down. They also accept credit cards. Is pc correct?   Still, 61c is just 2 adjustments away from cafe stardom. Hope they're adjustable, b4 my next Pgh extravaganza.",

The cranberry oatmeal muffin is my secret hangover cure, but all of the muffins are the best-in-class. The scones and chocolate croissants are excellent as well. If you want something healthier, the smoothies are always great. They are made from straight-up fruit: you pick one that will be juiced in front of your very eyes, one blended in frozen, and a thickener of banana, yogurt, or granola. There is no ice added, no syrup, no extra sweetener. Fantastic. An all-around great place to stop in for a quick coffee before work, or to hang out with a pastry and a good book.",

Plenty of table space and outlets, free wifi, and late hours (open til 11pm on weekdays, 12am on weekends), which makes it a great place to work - probably the best place to work in Squirrel Hill besides the public library.

I liked to come work on my thesis here, and at night there were generally seats available, but not very many outlets. The fruit smoothies they make are great, and the cookies are good here. They have a decent tea collection, and I've never tried any of their coffee.  Good for groups or flying solo. There is lots of seating inside, and there is a really cute patio outside for when the weather is nice! It has a nice feeling inside, and the atmosphere is generally very enjoyable.  Cash only! There is an ATM at a bank about a block north on Murray if you need to stop by one on your way in.  My only real main complaint is that a couple of nights before 11:00 closing when I was there it would get REALLY loud. There was sometimes a large group of homeless-y looking people (I have no idea if that's an incorrect judgement on my part, and if so, I apologize) that would come in and hang out with the barista and be really loud and chaotic. It was pretty disruptive so I stopped going as often.",

My biggest problem is with the shop itself. The tables are tiny and outdated, the chairs uncomfortable, and it's not a good place to get work done. Even though the coffee and food here is much better than Starbucks, I'd rather go there to study because it's comfortable, clean, and more modern. 61c is dated, and it shows- I remember it was always packed to the brim when I was younger, but have barely seen more than a few tables filled recently.  All in all, a fine stop for a quick coffee or treat, but not the best place to anchor down for a few hours",

The barista who made eye contact with me when I came in the door didn't say Hi, or even when I was waiting in line to be served. If there's anything I've learned in the customer service business you always greet your guests, and when you're occupied with something, you apologized once you greet them. This was not the case with the blonde haired female I encountered. I was craving a scone and with their many assortments I thought I came to the right place. Wrong. The blueberry scone I purchased had no flavor at all. It was extremely bland, as if a major ingredient was missing... Sugar? Anyways after going here once and having both a flavor-less scone (threw it away after two bites) and poor customer service, I've learned there is plenty of other coffee shops within the area to go to besides this one.",

If it's busy or even remotely trafficked, be prepared to hear multiple conversations stacking upon either your own or the music pumping through your headphones.

They have a nice selection of pastries and granola as well to snack on. Another customer ahead of me got a smoothie and I was pleased to see fresh, whole apples going into the blender along with scoopfuls of their granola. Will definitely need to try a smoothie one of these days!   Outdoor seating is pleasant if the weather is nice, otherwise the inside is simple and clean - standard tables & chairs.

    "text": "While on my first visit to 61C I questioned its merit, this little coffee shop has really grown on me for a variety of reasons.  First, while it looks meager from the outside, the inside is fairly large, bright, and clean.  I have never had to fight for a seat, unlike the delicious but packed Commonplace up the street.  There is also a little outdoor seating area, which is lovely in the warm weather.  Yes, they are always out of about half of the fruits for the smoothies, and paying $5.62 with tax for a smoothie that may not be exactly what I wanted does not thrill me.  But the baristas are really great about helping anyone find a combination that goes well together.  Blueberry, apple, banana is always good, and I just tried a yummy blackberry, pear, banana one the other day.  I love smoothies and seeing them put all of the fresh fruit into my drink makes me so happy.  I actually like their coffees and hot chocolate too, but I do favor Commonplace up the street for these things.  61C is a better price and larger portion, but they haven't won me over for those things yet.  Additionally, the baked good are yummy, and there are always so many to choose from!  They definitely have the market for most options of baked goods with your drink of choice.  Probably the best part about 61C is the hours.  They are often open when no one else is, and it is nice that they are open until 10:00 PM.  Now if they would just get Square...  Cash only.",

I was expecting a steaming hot coffee instead of the lukewarm coffee they offered. Also, the bitterness is dominating when compared to the regular mocha Cappuccino I usually have.",

    "text": "I think 61C is a little-underrated for the area, possibly because it is low-key.  It thankfully lacks the sterility of the chains available around up street without having any hints of pretentiousness.  I went midday on a weekend and it was quiet and spacious.  I felt welcomed by all the space.  I'm a shy person, but I'm working on asking what's in drinks before ordering them.  The barista on staff at the time was totally into that, and answered all of my questions.  From his answers, I decided on a smoothie made with cow milk and real fruit (I chose banana and mango).  To his credit, when I asked for milk, he confirmed what type of milk I wanted--that would have been a good save had I meant something else--good job.  I do hope he ate the extras that did not fit in the glass he served me!    This was a 4 star smoothie.  It was simple and very good. It was also thick enough for my tastes--I only like smoothies thick.  It is not in the same league as the $8 smoothies down the hill, but I wasn't expecting that.  I'm glad that there is another decent smoothie option that I know about in Squirrel Hill.  What 61C deserves 5 stars for is the looks of their baked goods.  Nothing turns me off faster than baked goods wrapped in plastic wrap.  I don't know what does it, but all desire to eat goes out the window for me.  So, conversely, in 61C with their long counter of beautiful glass jars of perfectly round giant cookies, long thick biscotti, and platters of muffins and other goodies, really made me salivate.  I had my eye on a specific blueberry muffin and asked the barista for it and he confirmed which exact muffin I wanted--good job.    The free water was easy to find.  The wifi password was in a good location and the wifi worked well for me during my visit.  The muffin was a little different than expected as it was more like a bread than a cake, meaning that it did not crumb when I pulled pieces off.  It was enjoyable, just different.  It was a good combo with the smoothie, although I have to say it was still a bit sugar-licious for lunch...I felt the effects later when I crashed.  I want to come back and try more yummies...and try coffee with the other half.  My sense of their menu is they take it seriously enough (without doing ballet with it).",

Coffee was good (and affordable..) and the cookies/pastries aren't bad either.   Staff was very friendly, but can be a bit slow. There was only one when we went, and each order took forever. Saw a few people leave seeing that it was taking so long for the people in front of them.   If you're not in a rush, it's a good coffee option.",

I think I like this location because it's not trying too hard, I usually can find a seat, and it attracts regulars.  I will be honest sometimes the baristas leave a little to be desired. There have been times where I feel like they are annoyed by my presence, which is why I wouldn't say this place is superb. However I wouldn't say they are coffee snobs like you can experience at some cafes.   This location is really good for studying, they have simple tables that can fit multiple books or laptops. Most of the patrons are there to get work done.   There are typically lots of pastry options including homemade granola.   I will warn you though; they only take cash here.  If you stop by then you may see me in the corner working on my differential equations homework or writing a review like this one.",

    "text": "I hate to do this, but based on my experience last night, I feel that I need to write an update and decrease my rating.  First, the positives: The baristas last night (both female) were very helpful and upbeat, unlike the baristas I'm used to dealing with here.  One of them made me an awesome smoothie consisting of blueberries, pineapple, cherry, and pear (see photo), and it was amazing.  My only complaint is that I noticed there was some left over from the blending, and it would have been nice to have offered it to me (though I didn't notice until too late).  I also ordered a mocha cappuccino that was pretty good, and well-caffeinated, as my friends can attest by my high-energy talkativeness after drinking it.  Despite these positives, we encountered several issues.  First, one of my friends ordered a red velvet biscotti, and tasted a moldy flavor when he bit into it (I confirmed the odd taste).  He informed them of the problem, and they did credit him for it, but I'm not sure if they discarded the rest of that type of biscotti.  Second, when I went to use the bathroom to wash up, the toilet seat was sporting some pretty gross stains (please pardon the graphic image).  Third, when we returned our dishes when we went to leave, I noticed that one of the \"clean\" water cups had some serious residue from some other drink.  I grabbed it and placed it with our dirty dishes, but still, the baristas should eyeball them before placing them in the clean stacks, so that obviously dirty cups don't end up there.  In general, I still like the 61C and most of what they serve, and my friends and I will probably be back, since it's convenient for them and a great hang out spot.  I'll give the benefit of the doubt of half of a star due to the friendly service and delicious smoothie, but they really need to take care of the blatant issues I mentioned to avoid scaring people away.  3.5 stars.",
