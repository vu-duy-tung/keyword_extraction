I've never had a bad meal here.  The menu changes periodically, but they keep certain dishes on as standard. I'm always excited to try their different seafood dishes, and the Iovino's appetizer with sweet italian sausage, tomato, basil, and tempura mozzarella is to die for. The homemade deserts are wonderful.",

    "text": "So happy I finally gave Cafe io a try!  Was in the Mount Lebo area for business and needed to grab a late lunch with some colleagues (~1pm).  After avoiding a potential chain-restaurant fiasco, we agreed to give io a go.  Simple, well-executed, darn good food.  I don't know how else to describe it.  My crab cake sandwich was fantastic (no significant filler, perfectly toasted bread) and my coworker's chicken BLT was apparently knock your socks off simple good.  I had debated ordering the fish tacos, and after seeing them come out to a few tables around us, I'll definitely be going back to give them a go!  The staff is well-attentive, and unlike a lot of the reviews, we managed to walk right in and grab a seat (likely due to the time of day).  While I was there, I also found out that they host monthly beer pairing dinners, which definitely has been added to my list of 10,000 other things to try!  If you're in the area, do yourself a favor and grab lunch here.  While I wouldn't give it a solid 5 (prices may be a little high for the suburbs...  just barely), I would say that this place just works....  can't really exlain it in any other way!",

Service was very friendly and we all had very good meals.  It would have been a bit better if they had some noise dampeners - it was very loud and difficult to have a conversation (especially with a person that was hard of hearing).  Looked like they had dampeners on the ceiling but they were painted over to match the walls, which I believe eliminated their dampening ability.  Overall, a nice place with good food.  Will definitely return if in the area, but I know the 'rents will definitely be back.",

    "text": "After a long hiatus, I decided to give Cafe IO another try. My first trip to Cafe IO left me hungry and disappointed. I ordered the city chicken knowing it was actually pork but was quite surprisd by the fact that it was served medium rare. I was not asked how I wanted my pork done and would never have ordered it medium rare. I only eat pork that is medium well to well. When I told my server this, I was told there is nothing they could do about it. Needless to say, I didn't go back for well over a year   This time, I noticed that the menu had changed and the place had significantly increased in popularity. We arrived at 7:30 and were told we would have to wait a half an hour. After convincing my husband to stay and wait, we made our way to the back of the room to the bar which is quite small and crowded. NOTE: They are no longer BYOB. You can bring your own bottle of wine but there is a corkage fee. I believe it's $10. Within 15 minutes, we had a table. Th menu consisted of sandwiches, burgers, salads and homestyle favorites. I ordered the turkey with mashed potatoes with bacon on top. Delicious. My dinning companions ordered a variey of sanwhiches/burgers and really enjoyed their meals. For dessert, we shared the Ghiradelli chocolate brownie sundae. Chocolate decadence!   Overall, I think that Cafe IO has made some significant improvements over the last two years. The menu is more appropriate for the location and clientele. The service is good and the drinks are reasonably priced. However, if you go on the weekend expect to wait 20+ minutes. They do not take reservations.",

The crispy green bean appetizer is awesome; the beans are still al dente with a light breeding that does not overwhelm the vegetable. I had the veggie grilled cheese with tomato basil soup. I would have liked grilled instead of toasted bread and more melted cheese to prevent the vegetables from making the bread soggy on the bottom, but the flavored were great and the soup especially good. My companion had the orrechiette, which was flavorful and simple. We were both happy with the experience and especially the excellent service. The menu has a bit of something for everyone - from higher end specials and entrees to pastas, sandwiches and burgers as well as salads. If you haven't tried what is apparently a new model for Cafe Io, check it out.",

After quickly looking at the menu, we decided to start off our evening by sharing the crispy green beans.  They ended up being green beans coated in panko and came with a horseradish dipping sauce.  While the green beans were seasoned nicely and were very tasty, I was sad the the sauce that came with it did not have any kick to it at all and seemed to be more like a sour cream than a horseradish.  For my dinner entree I ended up ordering the tomato cream fettuccine which came topped with spinach and shrimp.  Whenever it came out I thought that the size of the pasta looked a bit small, especially for the price.  I did end up enjoying it though as the shrimp and pasta were cooked nicely while the sauce was fairly tasty.  I only wish that they would have given the table or me some bread to eat with the pasta.  The bottom line for me is that I might head back here again in the future.  While nothing was bad about the place and the food was solid, nothing really blew me away.  Due to that I feel like I could have gotten better value for my food at many other places.",

    "text": "I came to cafe io on a Saturday for late lunch. The place was pretty empty and we were allowed to seat ourselves. The decor is classy and welcoming, although the space is a little cramped. The bar is jammed into narrow hallway that leads to the kitchen. I would not want to sit there, but they made the best of the space they had.   This place is expensive for a cafe-type lunch atmosphere, but I was expecting this. I hoped that the prices reflected a higher quality dining experience, but I was disappointed. I ordered the french mushroom soup to start. This soup was so close to being awesome, but employee incompetence ruined it. My soup was very nearly cold. The cheese on top was not melted, as I'm sure it's supposed to be, and the cool temperature was a surprise. The soup itself was actually very good, and I was starving so I started eating it anyway. By the time our server reappeared (much, much later), I had already eaten most of it so I decided not to complain.  My mom and I decided to split the fish tacos. Another disappointment. They were dry, flavorless, and cold--again. I just ate them anyway.  They had a sauce on them that I assume was supposed to add flavor but I couldn't taste it at all. The tacos also came with fries on top instead of on the side, which wasn't really clear on the menu. I wouldn't mind, except there were only 3-4 fries on each taco, so the sum total of fries was significantly less than if they were a real side dish. Bummer, because I was splitting with my mom and more food would have been better. Luckily, we also ordered a side of sweet potato fries. My mom really liked them, but I wasn't impressed. They didn't have any seasoning on them. This is what my mom liked, because she generally doesn't care for sweet potato fries, but loves sweet potatoes. I was just not impressed with these unseasoned sticks of sweet potato.   Overall, there was nothing terrible here, but I wasn't blown away by anything either, and the prices were too high. The cold food was probably due in part to the time of day (between lunch and dinner shifts), but I still don't excuse them for it. I won't be back.",

My daughter's pasta was dry! There was not enough sauce to even touch all the noodles. She is shy and won't complain. So she ate very little. Service was disinterested, Ask if all was okay but not wait for answer. Never questioned why we left so much food untouched. $53 is a bit steep for such mediocrity",

They were pretty busy and because it's small the place seemed a little loud but it wasn't a deal breaker just can make dinner chat a little difficult. She did forget our appetizer but I have to chuck that up to either she didn't hear us order it or forgot because they were so busy, but no big, we got our food in a timely fashion and everything was good.

Ordered  the butternut squash, sausage and can't-remember-what-the-other-ingredients-were  soup, which was a special that day.  It was exceptional.  It had flavor upon flavor upon flavor.  Mmmmm!",

The Mediterranean Bronzini on a parmesan polenta was perfectly cooked and very tasty.  Of course SWMBO ordered the crispy Green Beans to start, that are so much fun to eat.   As always, the service was good.",

I couldn't afford to pay a $1.50 tip and the waiters, waitresses and owner proceeded to scream at me, a 13 year old who has always tipped before.  Afterwards, they banned my mother and family from the establishment claiming that we stole from a girl's college tuition for not paying a tiny tip if $1.50. If it's that important, they should include the tip within the check as a service fee. My mother and I have never been treated so poorly by a restaurant where we knew the owners and servers. Think twice before ever going there again. I have never cried after a restaurant going experience. Also, I DIDN'T EVEN EAT. Those people have quite the nerve to yell at young girls scrapping their pennies together to pay for a meal. Never again will I eat there, And I suggest that nobody else does either.",

Let me also tell you that you must get the French Mushroom soup!! Think FO soup only way better. It comes with a little shaving of parm cheese on top that is the perfect amount.  I crave that, I want more. They also serve alcohol which is always a plus in my book. I've only been in for lunch twice so far, but I am really looking forward to trying other menu items!",

    "text": "Definitely looking forward to checking Cafe Io out given the positive reviews. Unfortunately there must be a lot of people whom live in the Dormont/Mt. Lebo area that have no idea what good food is supposed to taste like. I had the poutine app to start, which was a bust. The gravy was watered down and they served it with beef slices which wasn't what I was expecting. Needless to say, the beef was on par with something I could get at Arby's.   The Pittsburgh Crab Cake sandwich was such a disappointment. Nothing about it was unique and I've had better quality of crab cakes from Giant Eagle. One tiny crab cake between two pieces of generic white toast. The bread it was served on was certainly not homemade. Tasted like toasted Wonder Bread to me. Fries that were placed on the sandwich were nothing special. Didn't seemed seasoned at all either  Overall, nothing at Cafe Io is something special and you're better off saving your money and making whatever is on their menu at home. I won't be back.",

We started with drinks from the bar, an amaretto sour and a makers mark old fashioned, both were outstanding and for $7, a great value. Then we ordered the crispy green bean app, which if you get anything, get the beans!!! Then I had the angus burger with the minestrone soup, both were outstanding! My wife had the special which was a salmon BLT and sweet potato fries, very good, fresh and tasty. My son, the vegan, had a delicious veggie pasta with fresh mushrooms and gluten free pasta! A great place, if you're in the south hills stop in and give it a shot!",

It's incredibly adorable inside, and we were lucky enough to sit in the best seat for date night, a cozy little set-up right in the corner by the window.   I started off with a delicious manhattan, which makes me wish they had a bigger bar area to grab some casual cocktails at with friends. But I'm okay sticking with a dinner cocktail for now.   We started with the Lovino ($10 - tempura mozzarella, Italian sweet sausage, marinated tomatoes, basil, organic mixed greens). You can't deny the power of tempura mozzarella. I kept repeating how much I enjoyed the balsamic too. Probably too much actually, much to the chagrin of my hubby.   Next I had the Mediterranean Bronzini ($22 - grilled fillet of Bronzini, crispy parmesan polenta, wilted spinach, marinated tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, extra virgin olive oil). Good thing it also had the balsamic on there so I could rave some more! There were two large pieces of fish too, so it was hard to finish the whole dish. Plus, the two fried polenta pieces gave it just the right amount of carby goodness that I craved.  I'll note that they have a large grilled cheese menu, which makes me want to come back again for lunch and also brings out the families for dinner. So know you can bring the kiddos!",

    "text": "Note: Strongly consider making a reservation due the Cafe Io's popularity and diminutive dining room to avoid enduring a wait (15 minutes) as we did.   Along a short but lively business district along Mt. Lebanon's Beverly Road exists a compact (cramped?) restaurant that shares its name with a priestess from Greek myth, a moon of the planet Jupiter, a programming language, and a genus of freshwater snail among other things. In actuality, Cafe Io is named after its proprietor, Jeff Iovino, who revamped and rechristened his own restaurant, streamlining the name as well as the menu.   A strikingly simple logo of almost glowing letters seemingly carved into grey gunmetal ingot is the only prominent feature of the restaurant's exterior. Inside, framed, generic paintings hang from bare, alabaster walls. The mundane sparseness of the decor, however, belies an interesting and eclectic menu that isn't shy of serving upmarket takes on burgers, sandwiches, and diner fare (Open-faced Turkey and Gravy anyone?) alongside maki, Orecchiette, and Jambalaya.   Sandwiches, however, were what our stomachs and wallets (they tend to run a little cheaper than the entrees) told us to go with, the gastro-financial zeitgeist putting us on a path where the familiar and homey are dressed-up for an elegant night of gadabout mischief.   Like a number of other reviewers, we (well Kay, my boss, to be honest) found the Crispy Green Beans hard to dismiss as an appetizer. The horseradish-laden, sour cream (?) based sauce could have gone well with any finger food, and the battered ejotes played the part of Everystarter and condiment vehicle (in these instances, we all know what the main attraction is here, folks) superbly, leaving us wanting a little more, as all first courses should.   Kay ordered the Hot Ham 'n Cheese Pretzel Which while I took on the Pittsburgh Style Crab Cake Sandwich. Envy and curiosity compelled us to switch plates after we consumed exactly half of each.   A full-bodied crab cake with a minute amount of filler made up the bulk of my aristocratic Primanti's-inspired classic. Toasted sourdough escorted it out of the Rolls Royce as a Napa cabbage slaw, a citrus aioli, and astonishingly crisp (aged?) tater shards kept it grounded thoroughly in the Steel City. As I reveled in every bite, I couldn't help but wonder how much fun its creator had as he conceived it. This was a jazz musician sneaking a Jimmy Page riff into a performance for the guy in the back who looks bored.   Eyeing up Kay's sandwich and longing to redeem myself for being tricked into the Redhead's latest marketing ploy, we enacted our plan, our pact if you will, neither of us regretting it one ounce. The Pretzel Which's bun was an 100% authentic pretzel complete with the required brackishness and chew factor. Contained within it were egregiously thick cuts of country ham, a drape of gouda, and a fantastic, housemade honey mustard.  A dandy Caesar Salad punctuated by a exemplary creamed, tart dressing seconded my sandwich.   Yet another astonishing incarnation of that dessert I continue to be infatuated with finished my end of dinner: A Fudge Brownie Sundae. Permeated and garnished with Ghirardelli chocolate as well as caramel, vanilla ice cream, and pecans, every morsel was a step into hell, and like the AC/DC song, it wasn't a bad place to be. Moisture met hardness, heat rubbed against cold, evil reconciled with the divine.   Topped off by a very genial, accommodating clientele (a fellow diner alerted a server to a recently vacated table next to her once she spotted us waiting near the entrance for seating) and a cool, capable, canny cutie of a server named Stephanie (we loved ya!)  with whom we couldn't stop gabbing, Cafe Io is the type of restaurant that makes the South Hills, and Mt. Lebanon in particular, unsung hero of a community that it is. Shadyside, eat your artichoke hearts out.   P.S. Some people apparently had issues with the noise level, but we barely minded it. To us, it was merely chatty (the tables are close together, thus one can hear everyone's conversations, which were not unpleasant to eavesdrop on) and never strident. It's not as if the latest Lamb of God album was blaring at 11, and you know I probably wouldn't have been put off by that. \\m/  Go, go, Cafe Io.",

I've brunch-ed with a girl friend here in jeans and a hoodie when we craved yummy grilled cheese as well as enjoyed a nice birthday dinner with some friends! The crispy green beans with the horseradish sauce is my favorite appetizer and the tomato hummus never fails to disappoint. They've a decent wine and cocktail selection. Today I was craving soup and the tomato bisque was just what I needed for the cold I was nursing today! I love that this place is one of the few that always has multiple vegetarian soup options, each of which have been pretty fabulous I must say. The spicy veg head is the loaded version of the \"plain Jane\" grilled cheese sandwich which I'd definitely recommend if you think you can handle the spicy kick is gives you with each bite. The hot Ham n Cheese Pretzel wich is also really good! 'Real' ham and great quality bread always makes a great sandwich. Cafe io has grown to become the \"trusty\" neighborhood restaurant that I love going back to whether by myself, or with a friend or even in group!",

This place is perfect; a casual cafe/cozy room, albeit very tiny, but not so small that you are sitting right up on someone. There are no tables right next to each other (hate that awkwardness where you are practically sharing a table with another couple). Lots of cute shops on this street to browse in after lunch or dinner.   The service is great, very professional, attentive, and down to earth. The food taste like it belongs in a 4 or 5 star restaurant, but its served in a cute little cafe. The food could easily be sold for 2 or 3 times the price if it were served in a bigger restaurant. Everything is home made, divine.  Appetizer: try the fresh hummus and pickled veggies, never knew I liked pickled veggies! Best hamburger I've ever had.  Everything from fish tacos to steak to pasta. Great salads served with fried onions on top. A nice little bar, good martini selection.   The amazing thing is the price. Most meals around 15$, great value and atmosphere.",

I asked for the fish tacos without onion, and the waitress said no. When the dish arrived, there were a few raw onions on top, and I just plucked them off. It wasnt like they were mixed in and impossible to remove. On a second  visit, i asked if I could substiture rice for fries with the fish tacos, an option that was available on all other sandwiches. When i asked why, the waitress said \"no\". Why? \"Because that is an entree\". I offered to pay extra. Still no.  For an  otherwise lovely place, this seems kind of \"soup Nazi\" to me, espcially when there are so many options in Mt Lebanon.",

I love walking into a place that feels cozy and intimate, with a small staff and lots of personal touches - and that's exactly what happened here. I was meeting a colleague for dinner on a weeknight after a very long day of travel (and dealing with Pittsburgh's never-ending terrible traffic). I found this place thanks to Yelpies and invited him to meet me here.  As I arrived early, I sat at the tiny little bar and ordered a cocktail. Holy. Cow. I can't remember the name, but I'll never forget the flavors of the gin martini with grapefruit and lemon juices and agave nectar. I knew I was off to a good start. When my colleague arrived, we were immediately seated. I ordered the orecchiette and he a burger. We were both very impressed with both the timeliness and flavor of the dishes. My pasta had the exact right amount of sauce, sausage, and veggies to make each bite perfection. We ended the meal with dessert drinks, and I have decided to start making the Nuts n Berries drink myself at home, it was so dreamy.  It pains me to say that I had one sad experience when I took some dessert to-go. While the substance of the berry/custard pie(?) should have been spot on, it was so dry that it crumbled each time I went for a bite. Either the dessert had been sitting awhile or there isn't enough moisture in the custard to keep this cohesive. I'm guessing that the former is the case.  All in all, I would really recommend this place for a casual but impressive dinner.",

My husband and I came here on a Friday night and it was packed and we figured they have to be doing something right. Looking at the menu, it's hard to identify their signature dishes as their menu has quite the assortment of cuisines. They have grilled cheeses, pastas, fried rices, jambalaya, tacos....identity crisis or jack of all trades? The hubby ordered the Chicken Marsala and I ordered the Fish Tacos and French Onion soup. I thought my soup was ok; definitely have had better. The fish tacos were good, but again, I've still had better. They were huge though. However, the chicken marsala was delicious. The pasta was cooked perfectly, as was the chicken. And the sauce! Perfectly sweet, savory and earthy, with hints of wine and garlic. So all in all, it was a hit and miss so we hope to be back to try other items from the menu.",

My boyfriend had the Thai butternut squash soup which he really liked. He also got the mushroom Swiss burger and he was not impressed. The burger was dry and the onions were not caramelized; they were just cooked onions. Additionally, we did not particularly like the atmosphere. We sat at one of the high tops in the back and it felt like we were in a high traffic area. I will say there were a couple of families there with small children and it is nice that they are accommodating in that way. We will definitely give this place another try at some point.

The grilled cheese has the perfect amount of cheese & bread (it's not greasy) & the tomato soup you can tell is made from scratch.  Also, the fish tacos are awesome!  Good service, the food comes out fast & good prices. You can't go wrong, Cafe io is a must try!",

    "text": "My visit to Cafe io it's a perfect example of why I love Yelp. With dozens of reviews, and a solid 4 stars, I decided to venture to this place to give it a try. And I was completely blown away by the amazing food, exceptional service, and homey feel of this little restaurant.  Let's start off with the exceptional service. I like how it wasn't just our waitress waiting on us (filling our drinks and serving our food to us). Everyone on the service team pitched in and provided service. That quality of customer service makes me really happy!  Now on to the food. Wow. That's all I can say. I had the French Mushroom Soup and the Chicken Marsala for my dinner. The flavor of the soup is something I cannot explain and I highly recommend giving it a try! The Chicken Marsala rocked my world! I think it is the Marsala sauce that made the dish. It was a perfect combination of sweet and savory. It was so good I had to steal my companion's french fries to pick up the leftover sauce on the plate!",

    "text": "This place is EXCELLENT.  I do not go five-star very often.  This is an unassuming, humble, little place on Beverly in Mt. Lebo that vastly exceeded my expectations.  Here is what I like:  1)  The setting is nice, classic, and cozy.  There is lots of glass at the front, admitting good, natural lighting.  The tables/chairs are efficiently spaced, so there is elbow room (not always the case in a smaller restaurant).  They have one of those \"air door\" things that really keeps the cold out in Winter, as guests walk in/out from outside.  2)  The FOOD is great.  I've had a steak, a crab-cake, two of their fancied-up grilled cheeses, entre salads, side salads, and homemade soups.  All of it has been fantastic.  The grilled-cheese with the BBQ on it is amazing, especially with the sweet-potato fries.  3)  Service is good and unobtrusive, matching the setting with efficient service that works.  Food prep. times are very reasonable.  This place makes a great date-night spot, and my lovely wife likes it, too.  Go and give these folks a try.",

    "text": "How did I not know this place exists for so long? Seriously, it's a 5 minute walk away from my house - HOW?  Cafe io may be my new favorite local spot to eat. It's cozy, it's comfortable - it's everything you want in a cafe with that little extra something that comes with a restaurant. The staff is great and the cooks specialize in well-done comfort food. Tomato soup, grilled cheese, burgers, those sorts of things, with daily and weekly specials that add a little extra flair to the menu and gives the adventurous folk some extra options. But really, comfort food's the way to go here: what's better on a Friday than eating your favorite soup or sandwich while sipping on a cocktail?  I personally highly recommend the hummus and vegetable plate, and the veggie sandwich was really yummy as well. My first visit was the day after Halloween so they still had a Pumpkin Pie martini that was wonderful, and I can't wait to see what other seasonal beverages this cafe may offer. Hopefully one of them goes with a crab cake sandwich, because that is next on my list of things to try!  Oh, and as if the food weren't enough of a reason to go, it looks like they often give donations to and do partnerships with local nonprofits. Comfort food that helps benefit a local cause - now really, how can you say no to that?",

The only slightly negative thing about this place is the acoustics. It gets very loud when the restaurant is full, making it hard to hear the people at your own table, but it's fine if there are only a few other diners. Highly recommend this place to everyone!",

    "text": "Yummmmmm! So happy I finally tried this place out. I stopped here with my mom for a spur of the moment lunch. We were really craving soup, and the menu looked delicious, so we were in.   We went on a Friday afternoon at about 1, and it was packed. People were pouring in left and right, but luckily we got there just in time to grab a seat. Side note: if you are claustrophobic or don't like loud spaces, I would avoid this place at their lunch rush. Maybe it was extra crazy because everyone is off for the holidays, but I'm not entirely sure. Things were a little crazy and disorganized at times.  We tried ordering the crispy green beans, but unfortunately they were out of them. I will definitely be back to try them because they looked so delicious. We ended up ordering grilled cheeses with tomato soup, and they were fantastic. The tomato soup was thicker but packed with flavor. Obviously, the grilled cheese was the perfect compliment.   We definitely ordered one of the cheaper items on the menu. I believe each of our meals was only $8, which is awesome for the high quality. However, things can get pricey. I'd say meals can range from $8-$25, so just know you'll be able to find something on the menu if you're on a budget, but you have the chance to completely splurge too! Highly recommend giving this place a try. Next time I go will probably be at a less hectic time of year.",

Everything was quick and fresh--this salad was the perfect option for a speedy lunch while still getting the benefits of a sit-down, served meal. The garlic shrimp was very flavorful and a great addition to the classic combo of cranberries, goat cheese, and nuts that topped the greens.   My only negative was the way some of the ingredients were added to the salad. While the plating looked lovely, the large wedges of apples had to be cut up before I could get a perfectly balanced bite on my fork. While this is a small thing, I think it would go far to have the apples diced so that they could be fully incorporated into the salad.",

I didn't even get a picture of my salad because it was so delicious.   I arrived around 11:50 and the place was almost completely empty, but by 12:15 the entire place was filled completely. We had a snug table in the back corner and got to catch up with our girlfriends.  The tomato soup and Greek chicken salad caught my eye today, and I'm so glad I tried them both. The tomato basil soup didn't even have any flour in it - yay for gluten free soup! The soup was comforting and warm on a chilly November day. Then I had the Greek chicken salad that was perfectly dressed with thinly sliced chicken.  It wasn't too filling but just perfect! I'd certainly come back here, but it didn't look they had gluten free bread for all the delicious sandwiches that they had.",

The food is mostly of homemade quality, fresh and always consistent. The entire staff is always super friendly. I really like their crab cakes, sweet potato fries and their soups are all homemade and delicious. Their salads always contain the freshest ingredients and are filling and delicious. The only con is in the winter, the draft of the front door can hit you if you're sitting at a table along the isle. I love visiting Cafe IO! Thanks for the yummy food, Cafe IO!",

    "text": "Cafe Io sits in the middle of part of the business district on Beverly Road. They also have a small cafe next door for takeout purposes. I arrived at the restaurant shortly after it opened and could virtually sit anywhere I wanted.  Within a matter of half an hour the place was nearly packed with people. They have an extensive menu. Two prominent choices on their menu include their tomato bisque soup which is very good and a selection of various types of grilled cheese sandwiches. I later learned from my waiter that their fish tacos are also popular.  I decided to stick with a spinach salad with cranberries and goat cheese. For a small uncharge I was able to have garlic shrimp added to my salad. I got my salad in no time. It wasn't altogether huge but was delicious. The shrimp was very flavorful-you get 4 added into the salad. My waiter was very friendly and attentive to my needs.  Hopefully when I return I will try the fish tacos. The only downside in this area is that there is limited metered parking and I just learned that they are currently building two other restaurants in this same complex.   It is my hope that they will expand parking so that it will be easier to get to. The place is small and as I noted they do fill up very quickly. Unless you plan to get dessert elsewhere I'd recommend go with the soup and your main course. They do have other soups if you are not a fan of tomato bisque and they also have a soup of the day.",

The others in my party had a filet on mashed potatoes with a tasty sauce, a flank steak with mashed sweet potatoes, and pan seared fluke on quinoa.  The menu changes frequently, so check the website for the latest offerings.  I don't go to Pittsburgh very often, but I'll certainly be visiting Iovino's again.",

The crab cake appetizer was a huge disappointment; the overcooked crab cakes looked like something produced by a machine straight from a freezer case and served with very old cabbage slaw.  The lettuce used in the Caesar salad was not fresh.  The price for Cod, a substitution for Chilean Sea Bass, was not adjusted and the presentation was unremarkable, as was the taste.  The Bronzini was overcooked and over salted served on a bed of cubed potatoes and not crispy ones as written in the description.  Nothing special about the ravioli or the dessert and again the presentation was unimpressive! The dinner, the music, and the absence of concern was inexcusable and overpriced.",

We each had trouble deciding what to get only bc there were so many different menu items that sounded delicious. The crispy green beans were a great starter with a rich and tangy horseradish sauce. My wife had the French mushroom soup and loved it. I had the chicken and sausage minestrone, loaded with veggies and meats and very tasty. For entrees she got the crab cake sandwich and I got the grouper special. She gets crab cake sandwiches basically everywhere but quickly deemed this one of her favorites. The crab cake itself was moist and booming with flavor and the crunchy sourdough toast was the perfect compliment. My grouper came grilled over jasmine rice with chopped celery and peppers in a spicy Cajun gumbo type sauce. The flakey fish was great with the crunchy vegetables and the sauce had the perfect amount of spice for me (but a little much for my wife's taste). We can't wait to go back and try the other things from the menu we wanted.  Well done cafe IO.",

The Crispy Green beans with their creamy horseradish sauce are a great app (it looks like everyone else ordered it too on Yelp). I had their Hot Ham N' Cheese Pretzelwich which is stuffed with thick cuts of country ham, gooey gouda, and has honey mustard on the side. The bun is a legit pretzel. Soooo damn good. Darren wanted to switch between halves so I got to try his Pittsburgh Crab Cake sandwich which was pretty good, even if I liked my pretzelwich better. For dessert it was the dreamy, fruity Limoncello cake. The ambience is very chatty. Our server Stephanie was a doll. I recommend dinner here since the food is good and offers something for everyone, including those on a budget.",

Disco music (yes, disco) competed with table conversation. Too loud, especially for such a small place.  Food, bleh. One of our party didn't get what he ordered.

The food here is interesting and innovative, and focuses on local ingredients.  I had a PLT sandwich - shaved and deep-fried pieces of portobello mushroom, lettuce, and tomato, on perfectly toasted white bread and accompanied by sweet potato fries.  It is a delicious sandwich that I have craved every time I've been in Pittsburgh.  The space itself is very minimalist and therefore can get loud, I've heard.  I visited with four friends towards the end of their lunch hours and received excellent service.  I would highly recommend it for a quick bite to eat while completing shopping or banking on Beverly Road.    My only gripe is the fact that they are closed Sundays and Mondays.  Since I am usually in town on weekends, this really limits my ability to visit.  However, the food was great and more than enough reason to set aside my minor gripe.  I hope to return soon and try more of Iovino's wonderful food.",

I had also had the best Tagine I have ever had back when it was Iovino's.  So I was surprised when we looked at the menu that things were under $20 and much more casual.  I guess they decided to revamp the menu when then changed from Iovinos to iO.  I had the braised beef chilli over a parmasean polenta, which was a special.  It was fantastic and super filling!  My BF had a burger which he said was cooked to his medium preference and good.  Our server was really nice, very attentive.  It wasn't busy for a Wednesday.  I'm glad they changed their set up to a more casual neighborhood eatery.  They do serve wine and beer now, but you still can BYO.  So moral of this story.....if you are avoiding this place because of the old expensive menu from its Iovino's days, its time to revisit iO.",

None of the 4 of us could communicate with one another over the tinny clatter. Unfortunately, one of the members of the party had ordered a martini. The same member  of the party decided he could not tolerate the noise. We rose to leave and informed the host. He informed us that we would have to pay for the ordered drink, whether we drink it or not. Fair enough. It was made. Those around the seemed to be enjoying their food. It looked appetizing. No matter how appetizing the food, it is of doubtful appeal  in such a cacophonous dining room. Unless you plan to visit on a slow night, be prepared for a jarring experience. Update- I increased my review to 3 stars. It's probably closer to three and a half. It is still jarringly loud in this restaurant. But I think the food,  the service, and the excellence of the cocktails make this place worth visiting",
