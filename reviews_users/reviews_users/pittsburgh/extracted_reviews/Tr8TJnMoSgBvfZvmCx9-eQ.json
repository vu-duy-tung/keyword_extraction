I tried to stir it up with a spoon, and it stuck literally straight up in the solidified \"queso\". Ugh!",

I find the food there more variable and more enjoyable than the chain restaurants.  The margaritas are quite good and reasonably priced, especially if you get a pitcher. It is crowded on Friday nights but you can hang in the bar and sip your first margarita while you wait.  Overall, I think it's very enjoyable and will definitely go there more.",

The beef tacos are no different than an Old El Paso taco kit...beef seasoning, shredded cheese and cold thick flour tortillas...All the same as or worse than a kit...The wings were passable, we had to ask for menus, then to order, then chips, salsa, silverware, and napkins...most of which (or at least some of which is provided within a reasonable amount of time.) After we finally choked down as much as we could (we had been there for less than 45 min and ordered several drinks) a hefty blond lady came over and asked \"you done\".  I grew up in the service industry and feel for individuals who are having a tough night. This wasn't one of those evenings. There are at least 4 better Mexican options in the Wexford area. Go to one of them...or go to the grocery store and buy a taco kit",

No sauce!! The bean burrito was slightly more flavorful with blackbeans and FETA cheese.  Apparently, they knew there was some sort of white cheese in Mexican food but never heard of queso blancho, so they figured Greek feta would work. It doesn't. If you're in the area and you're looking for a place to grab a drink, this place would probably do, but don't go there expecting good food.",

Their rice was not like any kind of rice I've ever ate at a Mexican restaurant.  It was loaded with garlic and not tomatoey at all.  It was disgusting!   Yes, they do give you big portions but I fix better enchiladas at home!  The service was slow and are waiter was goofy acting.

See if you recognize it. :) It's up in the North Hills and despite it's country name - it's actually a Mexican restaurant. The food is cheap and pretty good. There aren't any \"great\" Mexican places in Pittsburgh, so don't expect that Neither is it always the best service on busy nights. Nice, just not \"fast\". HOWEVER...and this is where the 5 stars comes in...in my opinion, the BEST no-frills Margarita in Pittsburgh. They have a separate bar that's almost the same size as the dining room. There's also a big front patio so you can camp while you wait for your table. Chances are, if you have an hour wait in front of you like we did one Friday night - 20 minutes with your new best friend the Mason Jar Margarita will make sure you really don't care how long you wait. They are available in two sizes (Stick with the smaller one if you don't want to be seeing double enchiladas at dinner).",

Margarita was decent, kinda like the Jose Cuervo pre-made jugs. The chips were nice and crispy but the salsa was similar to Pace. I ordered the lunch taco salad with beans instead of meat. It was a cute small taco shell, a good portion for lunch. The only issue with my salad was that it had vinaigrette which did not mix well with the refried beans. The inside of this place was definitely authentic mexican too bad the food wasn't. Service was slow but it seemed like there was only 1 waiter in the whole place.",

My husband and I ate here and he ordered the special that day, which was a pork burrito. They were unfortunately out of the sauce to make it but the owner came up to our table and made it up to us by offering to make him a different burrito AND he brought us extra complimentary salsa when he saw that we didn't have much left at our table! My husband said it was the best burrito he ever had. My one and only complaint about this place is the size.. it's a small place so if you go around dinner time, there is usually a wait and the bar area gets very crowded but their huge margaritas of any flavor you can think of make up for it! I highly recommend this restaurant the next time you're in the mood for Mexican food.",

But before I get into that I do want to say the margaritas are out of this world!   Bad experience number one was dramatically dry beans when I went with my sister and we didn't think too much of it because typically we had a great time. The salsa portion with our chips was very small too.   Number two I ordered the mole and it was sickeningly sweet, even for my sister who has a sweet tooth. I had her try it to make sure I wasn't insane. Anyways i didn't eat more than one bite and the bite my sister took. Waiter comes back he was a bit sketchy seeming definitely a new hire and asked why I haven't eaten that much. I told him it was too sweet for me and I have had mole in the past it was never that sweet. He said mole is always sweet and did not even ask if I wanted to order something else. It wasn't until he asked if I wanted a box that I asked to speak to the manager because obviously I didn't want a box for food I wasn't going to eat! He said he would get him and forty five minutes had passed still nothing. He claimed he was in an interview and told him about the situation and said he would deal with it after. At this point my sister and I were annoyed and ready to leave so we decided we would wait fifteen more minutes so this would be an hour of waiting just for that. He never came out and the waiter said he couldn't do anything about the situation for me. So I paid for a meal that I did not even eat or enjoy and never went back. I used to love this place though.",

I called a week ago and asked if they took reservations - the answer was No, that they were on the \"no wait\" app. At 5:40pm today I checked in on the app.  It said we had a 38-55 minute wait. We waited outside with drinks and chips and salsa.  After multiple complaints to management now that we had been waiting for 80 mins they insisted we were next in line to be seated!  Another 25 mins go by and we still hadn't been seated - they asked us to go to the bar and place our food order.  Insisting that there wasn't enough seating to put 5 of us together and gave us the option to sit apart - there were several empty tables through the restaurant - for heavens sake just put them together!!!!!  Once we we finally seated - the waiter was very nice and accommodating.  I will say this was a rather disappointing evening especially when it's a farewell dinner to friends you've been working with for 10 years.  The parking lot needs some serious work!  The bathrooms literally have one stall.  While the food is good ,  I will likely choose elsewhere the next time I want Mexican food!",

Overall, I feel like The Franklin Inn is a neighborhood restaurant for the surrounding neighborhood more than a destination restaurant for those living further away, say, in the city. The food is average, but probably tastes a lot better if you're local and it's the closest Mexican-inspired food nearby, and the service is spotty unless you sit at the bar. Our latest server was decent, but only after she noticed us sitting at our table for what felt like ten minutes. She then forgot the little requests, like \"no sour cream and no guac, but add lettuce.\" It wasn't the biggest error, but one which meant that the restaurant just wasted food that we didn't eat, and showed that she didn't pay close attention. It's not the first time that's happened there, but at least the servers are always quick to fix forgotten requests.  The margaritas are pretty decent, and I enjoy the touch of the mason jars they're served in, but they're a little too sweet for me. Of course, I'm typically more of an eater than a drinker, so the food usually needs to be the high point of an experience. Sadly, that's where The Franklin Inn has always left me underwhelmed. The one thing I do enjoy is their queso. It's so incredibly thick and rich that you better REALLY like cheese if you order it. Of course, that also means that it's so heavy that I feel like I should've run a marathon before ordering such an appetizer.  I've tried the wings, quesadillas, and tacos. Some of my friends really enjoy their chorizo, but I've always felt like it was incredibly dry and overcooked. The shrimp fajitas we had, while having good flavor, seemed like they were shrimp out of bag of precooked and frozen shrimp. They came out waaaaaaay overcooked. You also only get 8 little shrimp on a giant skillet of peppers and onions. Don't be surprised if you run out of shrimp by the third tortilla shell and enjoy a third tortilla of just peppers and onions.  As far as vibe, it's okay. If you're not from the area, it's easy to feel like an outsider. It seemed like many of the patrons were regulars based on the interactions between them and the hosts, bartenders, and waitstaff. That's not a bad thing, but adds to the neighborhood feel. At one point I said to my wife that it felt like the Mexican version of Breadsticks from Glee. The bar is small, but there are some nice TV's if you want to stop in and watch a game. It's a small space, but if you can get a seat, i'd always recommend the bar over the dining room.  Ultimately, I'm still willing to go back, but it'll likely always remain in the easy-to-ignore category for us since it lacks crave-worthy items.",

The staff is clearly overworked, service was glacial, and we were ignored for most of the evening. One of the margaritas was basically watered-down unflavored tequila. The chips were good and the queso was satisfactory, but the entrees were served barely warm and not particularly appetizing--one dish was unseasoned and dry, another was served in a sauce reminiscent of paste. Will not pass the recommendation on.",

My dinner arrives with red enchilada sauce ALL over the enchiladas and under them too! Mind you these have NEVER come with any hint of red sauce on them! NEVER! So I ask the waitress what's up and she says she wondered why there was red sauce all over them! Then the acting manager Chris comes over and asks what's wrong. I tell him that these do not come covered and bathed in the red sauce. He says to me, \"Do you want me to remake them?\" Seriously? Yes please. Make them like they are suppose to be like. Insert eye roll here. He takes the plate and after 20 minutes return with them. They are COVERED in red sauce and are still sitting in a pool of it as well! That was it! I have been coming here for years and have always defended this restaurant when people said bad and unkind things about it but now I understand why people do that! Sorry but no more for me. You have lost a great customer bc of your inability to produce food like it was suppose to be made.",

    "text": "This place came highly recommended as the spot to go in the North Hills for Mexican food. I was really excited to find a potential go-to Mexican hotspot in my backyard but was rather disappointed after the experience.  Three of us went on a Wednesday afternoon so it wasn't overly busy. The waitress sat us in a corner table despite having other more open tables available. The first thing I noticed was how cramped the floor plan was. If it had been busy, you would be bumping into people just to get in and out of your seat.  The waitress brought us waters and the complimentary chips and salsa. It was strange that the menu stated you only get one basket of chips and bowl of salsa but our waitress kept bringing more and we weren't charged so that was a plus. I've never seen a Mexican joint specifically say only one basket before. We placed our orders quickly and I ordered off of their lunch menu. I got the Taco Salad with chicken and their cilantro dressing. It took a longer than normal amount of time for our food to come out for a typical Mexican restaurant in my opinion. When the food did make it out my friends were missing their salads. They had to track down the waitress to ask about them and she admitted that she totally forgot to put them in with the order. While my Taco Salad looked amazing, the taste was awful. First of all, the cilantro dressing was great! I will say that! But the chicken on the salad was like the stringy chicken from a can that was like warm and place on top of the veggies which made them slimey. The dressing helped mask the blandness somewhat but ultimately I only ate about a third of it. The waitress came to clear the plates and asked if I wanted a box. When I declined I expected her to ask if everything was okay because it was obvious I hadn't eaten much at all. She just took my plate away and brought the bill. I'll also note that she tried to carry too much and spilled salsa on my friend's lap and didn't even notice.  Both friends seemed to like their meals well enough but said they didn't think it lived up to the hype. We also didn't get any offer for refills on our waters the entire meal. We had to ask at he end after the plates were cleared.  Like I said, I was not impressed. The service was poor and the food was just south of so-so for me.  The atmosphere while decorated very nicely was far to cramped and a little dingie. I did like the look/presentation of the food and the cilantro dressing was a plus. They do sell that by the bottle. Perhaps I was there on a bad day but the experience definitely doesn't make me want to go back. I'll force myself to try it a second time to be sure but not before trying out some other local Mexican spots first.",

Fallbrook, CA and Brawley, CA has some of the best local Mexican restaurants bar none.    Franklin Inn will do for now; the flavors come very close.  It must be the absence of guacamole in the dishes.  Guacamole is standard in most plates in the west.  We will ask for it next time.    The portions are just right for Franklin Inn.  Not like Taco's Tomas in LA's famous Farmers Market where you need a full days fasting before eating their portions.  This is the best Mexican restaurant in the Burgh so far.  Now if you really want fish tacos.  Read my review of Juniper Grill.  I would compare their fish tacos to the Ensenada MX fish market stalls any day.",

I am not sure if maybe it was just an off night, or if things have changed, or if my tastes have changed. I would still call it good, though I may be biased, but a little bit closer to the \"fine\" end of the spectrum.   It's a cute place heavily decorated with Mexican souvenirs, artwork, masks, etc.  The waitstaff was different from those I had gotten to know when I was younger but everyone is very nice.  I was a bit confused about the wait for a table even though there were clearly a few empty tables in the dining area.   They seem to change their chips every time I'm there, but they were good. I have gotten them alone to go in the past.  I got the taco salad (as I almost always do-I love the fried tortilla bowl!). The proportion of chicken(you could also get beef if you preferred):lettuce ratio is -always pretty heavy on the meat (getting my money's worth). I think it was the dressing that didn't taste the same as I remembered. I also got a margarita, which was just as good as I remembered :)",

With regards to the food, the chips and salsa were fine, but nothing special. We ordered tamales as an appetizer. They were overly dry and stuck to the corn husk completely falling apart. We all ordered enchiladas. Sauce on all of them was very tasty making up for what seemed like totally unseasoned chicken on the inside. The Mexican rice was about the worst we have had ever. It was soggy with little flavor. Seemed like it had been boiled into oblivion. Margaritas were tasty, but they needed to stay in the blender longer as they more resembled \"on the rocks\" with tiny ice cubes rather than frozen. Given the typical long wait, it is doubtful we will be back as the food does not warrant such a wait.",

Ordered 12, and wow they tasted even better than we remembered.  I have to say the consistency of their wings is mind boggling.  I've been eating at this fine establishment since the late 80's, and I've always ordered the wings.  I'm happy to report they are still as good as they always been.  I did not get a chance to order their margaritas this time, but saw they were still pouring free hand on the heavy side.  I'm sure they are just as strong as they have always been.  Now as far as the rest of their food goes I have to say it's so so, but honestly their wings and margaritas are worth the trip here!  You won't be sorry.  So glad this place is still going strong in my old neighborhood!",

We were ok with that because we just sat and talked.  After quite a while of waiting, the very person who took my sister's name asked if we were on the wait list.  My sister said yes, of course.  The server checked the list and said her name was not on it.  She was the very one who took the name!  She asked if we had been waiting long and I said yes, quite a while!  She said she would get a table for us right away.  Of course it was the one right by the door where everyone bumps you as they walk in!  We asked for another table as the place was clearing out since it was now about 3:15.  We moved to the other room.  We had our drinks from the first table but no chips.  After a while, the server came to take our order.  Still no chips.  They finally arrived a few minutes before our lunch.  Everyone's food was ok, sort of.  I ordered 2 things from the mini combo.  One was very hot and the other was just lukewarm.  My niece's lunch was completely wrong.  Not what she ordered.  Of course it took quite a while for her new lunch to arrive.  We were all pretty much done eating when hers finally got to the table.  They were nice enough to not charge for her lunch.  I have to say the food is not quite as good as it used to be.  Service is definitely not good.  Our server seemed so hurried and aggravated.  Maybe she was having a bad day.",

The interior is nice and warm, the beers & margaritas cold, and the staff friendly.  I've been coming here for years and never had a bad meal.  The poblano peppers mole is outstanding, and the nachos & fajitas never disappoint.  There's always more than enough food per portion, so your money is well spent.  Do yourself a favor and try it out.  I bet you come back.",

There are only two drawbacks to the restaurant and they are that the bar is too small and frequently standing room only and that they do not have enough glasses. Nobody wants an ice cold beer poured into a hot glass straight from the washer. Don't get me wrong a cold beer in dirty glass would be worse. While I understand that you just can't add to a building overnight it wouldn't be too difficult to up the amount of glasses in circulation.",

As a North Hills resident, I actually feel bad for having recommended this restaurant to people so many times in the past.  Two weekends ago my family was visiting from out of town, so we decided to take them here.  We used the NoWait app, got there, and the app said our table was ready.  The hostess said that because we had six people, our table wasn't quite ready yet.  No problem, I've used NoWait many places and it can't always be \"exact\" on your wait time.  Well, an hour and a half passed (we had two young boys with us, so we felt EVERY minute of it), and party after party filled in while we waited (even a party of 5).  We asked why they couldn't just put two tables together as we had been waiting so long, but they insisted that there was only one \"big\" table they could put us at, so they had to wait for those people to be finished.  No apologies or even acknowledgement (meanwhile, three other parties had experienced similar issues with the app and walked out).  When we finally sat down, it took 20 minutes to get drinks, was virtually impossible to get refills, and the food was nothing like it used to be.  I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because this place used to be a go-to of ours for Mexican in the North Hills and might still have the potential, but somewhere along the line, something's gone wrong.  If you sign up for the email club you do get a free entree on your birthday...I'd most likely go back for that, but don't see myself ever returning to pay full price again.",

The food was bland,things that should have been cooked well undercooked and then things that didn't need to be cooked as much were overcooked. Service was so-so and we were no there at a busy time so I can only imagine how it would be when the place is packed.  I don't know what people rave about - I got the southwestern salad with jalapeno vinaigrette dressing and shrimp - my shrimp was hard and overcooked (or possibly freezer-burnt?) and the dressing was bland while the cheese on the salad tasted/looked like it was Kraft Mexican Cheese blend - I would have expected some authentic Mexican cotija cheese at the least.  We also ordered the guacamole which we all love and it was just \"ok\" - bland and nothing special - we actually didn't even finish the small portion between the three of us which is unheard of!  My friends got the wahoo fish tacos and the chorizo quesadilla.  The fish on the tacos was dry and flavorless while the chorizo quesadilla lacked that special kick that chorizo sausage usually has. I would recommend any number of mexican restaurants in the Pittsburgh area over The Franklin Inn such as Casa Reyna, Las Palmas, Cafe Verde or even El Campesino, Patron's and Emilianos would be much better choices.",

The tortillas were served in a warming container but the tortillas were cold to the touch.  My other family members complained about their meals, saying the refried beans tasted like they were from a can and the rice was served cold.  I was there for lunch and the only server was the bartender, the tall guy with glasses.  We had to listen him loudly talk sports with the cook during our entire meal.

When we entered the establishment it wasn't very busy, but this is due to the time we visited the Franklin Inn which was around lunch time.   The restaurant did not seem very clean--the table behind us,  which was empty had food scattered all over the floor and the environment was kind of stale.   We were approached by a teenage girl who imediately took our drink order.  When we placed our order,  my husband ordered the taco meal.    She had to ask twice how many tacos he wanted when the menu clearly stated how many tacos you receive with the meal.  Once she walked away with our order,  within minutes she had to come back and ask again what sides he picked with his order.   We received our food and it poor at best.  The pinto beans obviously came from a can and the ground meat was terrible.  You would had received a better tasting meal going through the Taco Bell drive thru. To their credit,  the guacamole was very good,  but that was the only good tasting thing out of the meal.   It was difficult to get our drinks refilled and to get our check because our teenage waitress was too busy talking to a group of her friends that were also visiting the restaurant at the same time and was taking selfies with them!   Once her friends left,  she still did not acknowledge us and walked away.  I had to approach her with my credit card to pay the bill.  At that time,  she was texting. Poor food and service and I would not visit again.",

Try the mole enchiladas. Lot of seafood for the Lenten season. Daily specials. Try the hot wings. The salsa and the wings are spicy.  Also, the chef comes out to explain the menu to you and make suggestions. It makes you feel important. He is very nice and he explained why some of the reviews were bad, despite the long wait. He smiled and said well we are jam  packed everyday. He said a lot of things are being made in house. Seems to me that he is in control of the kitchen and fixing things.  I encourage everyone to at least give this place one try and ignore the reviews. What have you got to lose? All of the other Mexican places in the area are so so at best.",

I'm going to describe my latest trip there two weeks ago since it is most current. We used the no wait app, which malfunctioned that day yet Franklin Inn still had a table waiting for us. For that we were really grateful since it was a busy evening. That's where the enjoyment ended.  We waited a really long time for anyone to come to the table. She finally did & took our drink order. Then we waited a long time again. I nicely told her we were ready to order when she was. She turned around really angry and said that she was waiting on our drinks and couldn't wait on us until they were ready which made no sense especially since she kept going to all the tables around us. She finally brought our drinks and took our order 20 minutes after sitting down.  The drinks were not good. I had a classic blue margarita that had an awful flavor. My husband had a Moscow Mule that also was horrible.  I had the chorizo burrito, which I had in the past and was good. This time the chorizo was way overdone and had too much filler in it. Not good at all. The fajita veggies were underdone and disgusting. My husband had an enchilada that was also awful. We didn't bother to tell the waitress because she was mad I asked her to take our order and ignored us all night because of it.  There are too many good places in Pittsburgh that have good food and service to go back here.",

It took 10 minutes before our waitress came to our table to take our drink order. Ok, it was getting busy around that time, so again, no big deal. Chips and salsa took another 10 minutes, and another 5-10 minutes for guacamole to be brought. We had to wait for another round of drinks for another 10-15 minutes. Service makes or breaks the experience, and it's not our first time at the restaurant, but this time it was so bad that we aren't going back anymore. It is a nice neighborhood restaurant with decent drinks, a ok food and hit or miss service. A very disappointing experience for us. At another mexican chain restaurant one at least gets their water refilled in a timely manner.",

I was excited to try The Franklin Inn after hearing all about it. My friends parents ordered a margarita and I thought about ordering one until I tasted it. It was almost inedible with the amount of tequila in it. So we asked for another one and the waitress brought back the same margarita topped off with mango syrup and no ice. It was even worse than before. I was enjoying this place until the waitress tried to be sneaky with putting some syrup in an already gross margarita.   I ordered a chicken burrito. It was mediocre at best. I enjoyed what I had ordered but there was no flavor or seasoning. It was a tortilla, chicken, some cheese inside, and pico. Then melted cheese on top and my two sides. The sides were the black bean corn salad and fajita vegetables. The sides were also average. The prices are a little high for what you're getting.   For Mexican American food it was a poor attempt. The menu and chef could use some revamping. This is a place I'd come back to for chips and salsa and I'd try some tacos. I would have given them 4 stars if the waitress had not given back the same warm drink.",

We always thought that was a bit much and end ended up at a secondary restaurant!    Move over North Boro Mexican Restaurants, 10/10!!! Used Yelp Line Service, which I joined before I left home with 50 minutes and 10 Tables before me! Half hour drive and touch base with the Receptionist, and we had no more than a 15 minute wait!   Because it was so crowded, I expected to get a table and wait! Not so; Our waitress was taking our drink order within five minutes! We looked over the menu and our drinks were served! Was she going to come back for our food order? Nope, pen in hand, she was ready now! We had three different items and relaxed with our drinks! Best House Margaritas in the North, unless a family member makes it! Nice Surprise! Complementary Chips and Salsa! Large basket of chips, and salsa that our table of three did not finish, because food was brought to our table!   Piping hot, I mean smoking! You could seriously get burned on the fajita plate! Use caution, don't be a moron and enjoy! They give you fresh, heavy portions and four soft tortillas! I made them plump and still had a fist full of food that I couldn't finish!   Drinks, food, portions, and service was EXCEPTIONAL! Plan accordingly and you won't be disappointed! Well worth our wait and now looking forward to being a regular!    Our ordered items were Margaritas, Fajitas, Chimchungas, and Quesadillas! Recommend ALL of these items! Crowded for all, but it works! Enjo",

The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because the waiter was less than attentive. He took care of a table in front of us that was ordering a lot of drinks etc. and I could barely get a refill of my coke. The food though, very good! Highly recommend the chorizo burrito (a little spicy but great taste). My husband ordered the chicken chimichanga, also very good! A lot of people recommended the queso dip on here, so we tried it. Not worth 8 dollars, but it was pretty good. Probably would stick to just the chips and salsa given out next time. Overall, really fresh ingredients. Make time for drinks and waiting because you will wait!",

    "text": "I met here with some friends for dinner on Saturday night. My friends got here about 15 minutes before me at 5:30 and were told the wait would be 20-25 minutes. We had no problem with this!  Fast forward to 6:30... We are still waiting for a seat. We've asked the hostess multiple times, you know in case we got lost in the shuffle somehow, but no our table is supposedly next. At this point we've debated back and forth about just ordering food to-go and going back to someone's house to eat or just leaving and going somewhere else, but when told there is just 1 party ahead of you and then you are next to be seated it doesn't really make sense to leave at that point when you've put the time in. And we were by no means a large party, we were a table of 4 with a high chair and we had told the hostess if it would get us seated quicker we'd skip the highchair and just hold the baby.  About 6:45 our party of 5 went to 3, the baby was just too tired. And we finally got seated at 7:15. The wait was absolutely ridiculous. I completely understand a wait on a Saturday night, but don't quote us less than 30 minutes and it end up being an almost 2 hour wait. Over estimate the wait in the future, so you have customers who are pleasantly surprised when the wait isn't as long as told.  The food itself was very good, but I also could have been delusional from hunger. We had the cheese cilantro and an order of wings to start, because we destroyed the basket of chips in minutes. The cheese cilantro was much better then basic fried cheese sticks, the Monterey Jack cheese is extra gooey. The hot wings were delicious! The spiciness was like a slow good burn. I completely understand why our one friend ordered 2 full orders of wings for dinner.  For dinner I had the pineapple poblano pork burrito. The salsa was delicious, so good next time I would if I could have extra salsa inside the burrito and on the side.",

Try the empanadas -- especially the pork if they are available. They are so good and they sell out fast.

After a short wait, we were seated in the main room off the front of the entrance. There was a good and bustling vibe for a Thursday night, tables were full and bar was packed. It is an eclectic mix of Mexican decorations, but makes for a charming and warm atmosphere!  After being seated, our drink order was promptly taken - the margaritas are delicious! To accompany we had fresh chips, guacamole and a delicious salsa (house made). We placed our order for dinner, and despite the place being busy and packed, we received our order in a very timely fashion. My mother and grandmother ordered the enchilada special, my sister ordered the chimichanga, and I had the chorizo stuffed portobello mushrooms. Everything was delicious, hot, and had were nice portion sizes. The plates all had nice garnishes or accompaniments!   While we ate the Chef Ramirez came out and was not only checking on the diners, but was helping clear tables, etc. - a True team player that creates delicious food.   For dessert, we had the flan and the sopaipillas. I highly recommend both! The flan was nice and creamy, not too sweet. The sopaipillas were still warm, dusted with cinnamon sugar and drizzled with honey, and came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. A great finale to the meal!   I wish I wouldn't have waited so long to come here, and will definitely be back with family and friends soon!",

We had a great woman waiting on our table. I'm not even going to mention her name because she's not the reason it was a horrible visit. She was great. I hope she finds a better place to work.  Why this was so bad: the food. Plain and simple. The food is horrible. I had an enchilada which is (traditionally) served in a red sauce. There was something painted and dried on the outside of the enchilada. It was reddish, but it was DEFINITELY not sauce. This is not Mexican food. This is what the Midwest might think Mexican food might look like. Everything was limp. There was no color in the food. Real Mexican food has color! This was bland, dull, mushy food.  I will not be back. Horrible.",

Why not? We live pretty close. Got there and didn't have a wait at all, different story by the time we left. Love the vibe. Small, cozy, neighborhood restaurant,  terrific! We got a basket of chips and salsa. The chips are fresh and warm.  The salsa light and not too spicy. The hubby got the steak fajitas which smelled absolutely amazing, oh the pepper and onion smell,  sizzling goodness making my mouth water.  I chose the grilled mahi tacos which were light and fresh. Seasoned nicely not too spicy. Rice was good too. I have to say the margaritas,  though, they were FAN-FREAKING-TASTIC! I got pineapple infused. The hubby got coconut and all I have to say is, I wanted to take a vat home for later. Just, wow! For dessert I got Peanut butter pie which tasted like a peanut butter cup. Who doesn't like a peanut butter cup?? And the hubby got their hot fudge sundae,  also terrific with homemade hot fudge. And our waitress,  Kristie (Sorry if I spelled her name wrong)  was spot on. She was friendly and attentive.  I don't know why we waited so long but we will not wait that long again!!",

Unfortunately, we had the worst table in the house - immediately inside the door, and pretty much in every single person and server's way. I'm honestly not sure why a table is located there at all, and would highly encourage a rethinking of the seating layout, in my humble opinion. The service was impeccable, but the food was...well, not great. I ordered the shrimp/chicken fajita and both items were well overdone and the vegetables drenched in oil. I think I'll stick to the other Mexican offerings in the 'Burgh, but try it for yourself, especially if you're local!",

Franklin uses the No Wait app, so I put our name as we drove there. The parking lot was packed when we got there, but luckily we got a spot. Once we checked in, we had to wait another ten minutes before we were seated. We got a table in the very back of the restaurant.   Our waitress was very friendly and asked if we wanted to started with some margaritas. I ordered a small frozen strawberry margarita - heads up.. their margaritas are strong. They put a least a few shots tequila in.. so I asked for half the tequila. My friend ordered a small lime margarita on the rocks.   They provide chips and salsa for free - the chips are delicious - but we ordered their queso, because I had never it before. It was interesting to say the least. We got the cheddar cheese - you can also get pepper jack cheese or add chorizo to it. It was good, but not like anything I've had before. It was unique and I liked it.   For my entree, I ordered the mini combination with 3 smaller portions and two sides. I ordered a chicken enchilada, a shredded beef enchilada, and a chicken taco with double rice. I asked for the Colorado green Chile sauce for the enchiladas, but they gave me a red sauce. I wasn't a fan of the sauce - a little too spicy for my liking. The rice was a little too bland.   Our waitress was prompt and asked us if we needed anything. I asked for more napkins and a side of sour cream- she brought them right away. She also asked us if we wanted more margaritas with our meals. Of course, we got them. It's 5'oclock somewhere right?   Overall, I enjoyed my evening at the Frank - but would definitely try something new next time around.",

Everything on the menu is frozen, highly-processed garbage that comes from a microwave oven.   They serve canned refried beans, bulk grade seasoned beef in the tacos and don't even have queso blanco. They don't serve authentic Mexican rice and have a laughable limited selection of staple Mexican dishes.   For the extreme poor quality of food and marginal service that they offer, your money would be much better spent at Taco Bell.",

You know what I mean, it's the difference between your food being separated on the plate and not too saucy -vs- saucy beany cheesy delicious mess on your plate.  It is worth the trip to the North Hills, even if you prefer the sloppy stuff. They also have amazing margaritas and sangria.",

I had grilled fish tacos, which are served un-assembled. Loved that I could make my own! The fish was flaky and mild. The rice was good but the best part was the slaw - the perfect mixture of spicy and sweet, and a great compliment to the fish! Hubby got a special \"pot pie\", which was loaded with fresh seafood and Mexican spices - and covered in a light, flaky biscuit-type shell. So different and tasty! We were too full for dessert, and were sad to say no to the homemade ice cream. Can't wait to go back! It's small, and we were there in between lunch and dinner so got seated right away. I'd guess there'd be a long wait at normal lunch or dinner hours.",

    "text": "The Franklin Inn is easy to describe in one word, bland.  It's basically exactly what you would expect from a \"Mexican\" restaurant located where it is.  I should have known what I was in for when most people at the bar were eating wings.  Wings at a Mexican restaurant?  Seriously?    Anyway I love Mexican food and was excited to finally go there, well I doubt I'll be going back.  First off we had a party of 9, they refused to take reservations even for a party this large which is a rarity.  Their advice to us?  \"Call us an hour before you want to come to see how busy we are\", yeah thanks.    I ordered the Chicken Enchiladas, with rice and corn and bean salad as my sides.  When I say that nothing on my plate had any taste, it's not an exaggeration.  It was cheese, chicken and a corn tortilla.  I tasted no spices, and really no effort at all.  It legitimately was just those 3 ingredients on a plate, that's what it tasted like.  The rice and the bean/corn salad followed suit by being completely bland.   There was nothing to say that these enchiladas weren't purchased from the frozen food section at a grocery store and thrown in the oven.    If you are 90 years old, and like bland, tasteless, effortless food then this is the place for you, or apparently if you like wings (which I did not try).  If you actually want good Mexican food, where they put effort into their dishes then don't bother.",

Hub ordered the chorizo/potato stuffed poblano. It was blanketed in what looked like American cheese slices and the potatoes were raw. We each took two bites. Waitress was oblivious. Kept asking if we wanted \"to go\" containers. Never, ever asked why we didn't eat anything. Took our 10lb plates to throw away. THIS IS NOT MEXICAN FOOD!!!!!!",

Though I grew up in the 'Burgh, I now live in Philly; And yes, the restaurants there are more \"authentic\".  However, \"authentic\" doesn't always mean tasty.  But, the Franklin Inn is ALWAYS tasty!!!  You may recognize it from it's famous, though small, part in movie \"Dogma\". That wonderful \"cheese\" vibe still prevails.  The service is always great and the margaritas are some of the best that Pittsburgh has to offer.  Note: If you are going on the weekend, expect a wait.  The things they do best: * Chili Rellenos - My Mom always orders this dish.  She says it's the only thing that has ever come close to her Mexican rellenos experience (and, my parents are foodies).  Stuffed with cheese and batter fried to a golden brown, these mild peppers are a treat! * San Carlos Fisherman's Dinner - Crispy, flavorful cod that you fashion into the perfect soft taco = YUM! * Chicken Enchiladas with Pablano Mole - Their mole is BY FAR the best mole I have ever had!!!  The flavor is to die for!",

The line is long on Saturday which is not unusual for a popular restaurant.  What was unusual was the way their wait list was managed.  Our party was passed over a dozen times during a 2 hour period by groups of similar size.  The only difference was the groups being seated  seemed to know the greeters.  The conclusion we reached was that newcomers are not welcome.  Don't even try this place on a busy night if you aren't a regular.  It was terribly frustrating to be passed over.  No matter how good the food may be, it isn't worth it.  The disrespect we experienced tonight was unprecedented.  Just awful!",

For a while, we felt like the quality of the food was headed downhill, but I am writing this review because over the last 2 months, we feel like the quality and presentation is again on the upswing. The plating is better, and there is a sense of freshness to some new menu items. We want to encourage whatever is happening in the kitchen to continue happening.   The service for us has always been on the very casual side, but friendly. This is a pretty small place, so if you come with a large party, you may have to wait a while, as there are not that many tables.

I'm not sure why people expect 100% authentic Mexican cuisine in western Pennsylvania. I find the tiny atmosphere and friendly staff to be the most charming aspects of the place. The food IS GOOD. (Note: good, not five star, mind blowing, best Mexican ever. I've been to Mexico several times so I know the authentic stuff) I personally love the salsa and chips. The margaritas are great too! Original on the rocks with salt is the way to go. The Franklin Inn must be doing something right if the lobby is packed Thursday until Saturday for dinner. I will never get sick of the place, but maybe that is my bias that developed from being brought here since I was a child. Once a again, great atmosphere, great drinks and great chips.

I have been there on a Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday.  The restaurant is small which doesn't help.  When you enter you are greated with a smile from the hostess who normally tells you there is a 20 minute wait...lol.  The bar area is also small and if there is a wait that probably means the bar is full.  You can order food at the bar as well.  The waitresses are always friendly as well.  They usually look like chickens running around with their heads cut off but they do not ever seem to forget anything.  There is also a bus boy that provides salsa, chips, and will refill your drinks.  The food is authetic which doesn't mean everything you order is spicy.  I even love their side salads with the jalapeno vinaigrette.  The vegetables are fresh and the dressing is delicious.  I also enjoy the fried ice cream as well.  they offer it with chocolate or caramel sauce.  So let's get ot he good part, the margarita's...they are delicious.  You can get a variety of flavors and tequila.  They come out in a mason jar for sharing.  Be prepared to have a driver if you are going to try several different kinds.

Their Margaritas are by far the best Margarita you will have anywhere. The mason jars of them is the best way to go. But make sure you have a designated driver. These margaritas will give you a punch even if you only have one. The nachos they serve to everyone but fair warning we were told awhile back they use peanut oil. Thus the reason my daughter never goes with us here. The only problem is because of the small area it is extremely noisy and very hard to hear and the tables are so close together. Which is the reason they are not 5 star. I often wonder why they have not expanded or at least added a deck for the summer that they could enclose for the winter. Next time you want some great Mexican food and Margaritas head on over to the Franklin Inn.",

    "text": "When being seated, you are given free chips and salsa. Now, while this may seem like a minor detail, these chips and salsa are gonna tell you a whole lot about your experience here....  See, people either despise or adore this salsa, and whichever stance you take on this spicy tomato deliciousness will most likely be inductive of your stance on the restaurant as a whole.  If you couldn't tell already- let me just say that I love me some Franklin Inn. It may not be the best or the cheapest, but I'll be damned if it isn't some of the most satisfying grub in the North Hills.  Location is right off Oakleaf Lane, a smallish odd looking little building with a gravel parking lot. Honestly not too impressive, decor revealing it's hole-in-the-wall status. This place gets BUSY weekend nights, and is a local hang out, if you're from the area you are guaranteed to see at least several people you know on any trip.  Menu is exactly what you would expect, typical Mex-American fare, nothing too outrageous or notable. The Mexican Burger is about as original or inventive that any of the dishes get, so don't expect bold new strides in culinary artistry.  Recommended item: Fajitas of any variety (steak, veggie, chicken, shrimp, etc). The dish comes out sizzzzling hot, the meat is well cooked and seasoned, and the peppers and onions have that ever-so-slight crunch intact that adds so much satisfaction to the dish.  As for rest of the food, it's nothing much to write home about really, save for a few dishes that stand out from the crowd. This being said, no matter what item I order, I always end up leaving full and satisfied. There is definitely some kind of weird force at work there, but I always leave feeling great about what I just ate.   Also of note are the margaritas. Definitely give them a shot. They taste like the firey slurpee mix of a Mexican sun devil. In all the best ways.  Overall, it's a fairly polarizing place with it's fair share of love and hate. You're not going to know which side of the spectrum you fall on until you give it a try yourself. Either way with absolute confidence I can say \"I told you so!\"  Franklin Inn 4/5",

My sons beef burrito was almost as bland.  Also we had to listen to staff complain about new servers, and make inappropriate comments in regards to females. The bathroom was filthy as well.  Our server was pleasant and attentive, but that was overshadowed by the above. My family will not return which is a real shame since they used to be the best Mexican food in the North hills.",

Chris was extremely professional and easy to work with and prices were very reasonable. I'd definitely recommend them for your next event!  Also an awesome place to go sit down and eat.

    "text": "It's totally Mexi-cheesy decor and has that \"You come here as a regular and love it or you come here as a one-time thing and hate it\" attitude.  I enjoyed  Franklin Inn much more as a child when the only other benchmark I had was Chi-Chis and much more as an adult of legal drinking age.  I guess I haven't been here in a few years to experience their margaritas, but I was craving one on Saturday and didn't feel like hauling my cookies down to McKnight Rd for a Big Azz Marg at Mad Mex.  Their margarita got the job done.  There were about 8 different flavors that you could get in 16 or 32 oz mason jars; I went with a traditional on the rocks, no salt.  It was zippy but I missed the fresh lime tang and heat from good tequila that I've come to expect at other places.  It came with a basket of chips and salsa.  Salsa was nice, but more like salsa soup: partially watery with chunks of veggies here and there.  The best part was listening to the manager(?) explain that a Troegs Nugget Nectar is dark and not too hoppy.   #rly?  One of the bartenders said to another customer, \"If I drink beer, I go for a Miller,\" so their beer selection is definitely not where they focus attention.  I didn't get anything to eat, but I have been here for lunch/dinner and can say that it's \"American Mexican,\" but nothing fantastic (unless something changed since I ate here last, which I doubt).    We got a margarita, a Dos Equis, and a Troegs and the bill came to $18.  I guess that's comparable to Mad Mex.  It's getting 3-stars because it's \"a-ok.\"  I like it because I grew up coming here and probably will come back around happy hour, but if I want a trendier place with fresh, spicy offerings, I'll go elsewhere.",

    "text": "WTF?!?!   The menu claims everything is prepared fresh, which I'm sure it is, back at the restaurant supply distributor where they order from. If that's not bulk GFS or Sam's Club Salsa, then I'm Donald Trump and you should elect me for president.   Then came the entree. I ordered a beef burrito with refried beans and rice. The rice was cold to the touch, the refried beans were the consistency of spackle with a crust of paint chips  (and also cold). The burrito shell was doughy and elastic, and the shredded beef filling inside was lukewarm to the touch, and had zero seasoning. There was also a little container of black liquidy stuff on my plate which looked like it was wrung out of a dirt mop in the deep sink of the janitor closet. There were some chunks of stuff in it, but I don't know wtf it was, and I didn't want to find out. Since I was starving, I dug out my bland shredded beef from the cold husk of dough that resembled a burrito shell and picked at that while I watched my table companions politely nibble at their equally cold and bland entrees. Someone at the table ordered a \"sangria\", which we determined must have been cranberry and apple juice with a splash of maybe Boone's Farm wine. I had a Dos Equiis Amber, which came with a little lime wedge, which was by far the most flavorful food item I received all evening.  It was crowded and loud in there, so I guess the locals must come here just to get sloshed on margaritas before heading out to Taco Bell for a superior Mexican dining experience. This must be what prison food is like. If that's the case, it should be enough of a deterrent to scare anyone straight.   Bleh.",

We started our meal with cold beers with the happy hour discount. Chips and their salsa were enjoyed while waiting for our main courses, loved the fresh taste of the salsa. Chips were thin and crisp. We bother enjoy their enchiladas with rice and refried beans. I had the Aztec winter special enchiladas and love the bits of onion through out them and they were covered with gooey cheddar cheese. My cousin had the shredded beef. Atmosphere was great and not too loud, so allowed for great conversation.",

There's a reason why it's called Franklin inn and they serve Mexican food- worst Mexican I've had in my life. The food was bland, the salsa was sour. My husband asked if they can make this meal spicy and the waitress brought over Chula sauce. Service was okay. All the workers there seem to hang out in the back of the restaurant and drink. Thought I would try this place because co workers said it was good but I Would never go back.",
