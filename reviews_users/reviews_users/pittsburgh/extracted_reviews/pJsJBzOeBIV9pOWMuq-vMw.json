    "text": "I pass by here daily and one day I saw they had their open sign on. On a whim I went there with my wife to check out the new place. The decor was a very cool mix of vintage chandelier with modern furniture. The bar looked amazing especially the 22 taps with custom steel sign. There is also an upstairs balcony and outdoor enclosed courtyard with gas heaters. We are vegetarians and we had the jalapeno pierogies and the artichoke bruschetta. Both were amazing, especially the bruschetta was the best I had ever had! The service was excellent, and quick. One of the owners even came by and chatted with us for awhile answering questions about the restaurant. They have several large TV's which would be nice for watching the game - but not with a sports bar feel. Overall I love the addition of Dorothy 6 to Homestead and will definitely be back.",

The chef nailed it! I got the special; crab stuffed salmon on tomato risotto with lemon drizzled green beans. It was full of flavor. My party of four all really enjoyed their time and food! Pretty nice selection of drafts to chose from as well!",

    "text": "Although I was somewhat underwhelmed with the decor, it's refreshing to see a non-chain place pop up in Homestead. To put it simply, this place is ideal for a laid-back lunch/dinner. The drink selection is extensive and the entrees (while not especially inventive) consist of sturdy, comfort foods. Myself and my friend both went with the perogie entree. (I'd give two thumbs up for the standard cheddar perogies, but can't say I recommend the bacon/beer flavor.) The meal also came with a delicious side of brussel spots, and I added on a side of tender corned beef as well. Given the casual setting, I expected a smaller bill, but the delicious food and friendly service will likely make me a repeat visitor.",

    "text": "I've been waiting for this place to open for quite sometime.  I work in Homestead and drive by frequently and was tickled to see the \"Open\" sign lit up in the window a few weeks back.    Last night, I accompanied my mom to dinner here and was delighted the moment I walked in the door.  The ambiance has a mixed feel of comfort and flash.  The warm greeting we were given by the bartender set the best tone.  Taking in the large glittering crystal chandelier above, contrasted with the bare bones brick walls was a great touch.  It felt warm, inviting, and still hip enough to make me want to return.  We discovered they just had their grand opening last night.    If comfort food is their goal, they reached it.  I like fine dining, but also enjoy the staples - and again - Dorothy 6 seemed to mix the two.  We split a large beet and arugula salad and was the kitchen obliged by plating it beautifully on two separate dishes for us - with no extra charge or fuss.  I wish I had taken a picture, because it was presented so nicely.  Sliced beets gave the foundation to a mountain of arugula, dried cranberries, and sliced toasted almonds.  I chose the 8 oz strip with bacon brussels and mashed potatoes, mom had the salmon croquettes with the fall vegetable hash.  My strip steak was juicy, and prepared perfectly rare.  The brussels were also great, and my mouth watered with the flavors of bacon interspersed in the veggies.  The mashed potatoes seemed a bit flat though, and I had to add salt, and they could have been a bit more savory for my palate.  But in all, it was a perfectly comforting dish.  Mom really enjoyed the salmon croquettes and made a comment about the colorful display of the veggie hash.    We did NOT have room for the dessert - apple pie was offered by the very friendly wait staff - but I think I will be back to sample that at another time.   The service was very attentive, friendly, jovial, and knowledgeable.   I ordered a Moscow Mule cocktail, and asked it to be returned to add a splash more ginger beer, and they chided the bartender playfully about it.  The wine selection was just enough...sometimes restaurants can get a bit too much with their choices, and the array was diverse enough to give us options, but not overwhelming to the point where we had to take a half hour to study it.    In all, I was very pleased by the experience as was my mom who said she was shocked such a place existed in Homestead.  I am thrilled to see more locally owned establishments coming into this area!!  Its a welcome break from the flash of the big chain eateries across the tracks.  I will indeed return, and also tell my coworkers and friends to visit as well.",

They served us our soups and salads before they served our appetizers, and then from the time they cleared the appetizer/soup/salad dishes, it was almot 50 minutes until the entres arrived.  I had the meatloaf, and although it could have used more gravy, it was good.  My guest had a steak and it was done just as ordered.  The apple pie wasn't the best I've had, but it was good.

The atmosphere is nice. Good textures wood floors, brick walls, tin ceiling. Beer selection looked good with a lot of draft beers on tap. Our waitress got us water and took our drink order shortly after seating. She took our food order and another round of drinks. The four of us all got sandwiches. About an hour and twenty minutes later we were served our food. That seems to be the issue this place has. They can't get the food out. The sandwiches were good. No problem there. But if you have anything else to do that evening this probably isn't the spot to eat. The manager who I believe also to be the owner did stop by the table.  Seemed to have an attitude. Offered no apology or reason and walked away from us. Not good! Our waitress took $5.00 off each of two checks which was nice. Management has to have a better feel for service though and most of all get the kitchen to turn out tickets faster. I wish them good luck here. Not a bad place. Just needs a little more.",

    "text": "After visiting Dorothy 6 cafe twice in the last 5 months, I am thoroughly confused as to how most of these reviews are even talking about the same restaurant. As a Munhall resident, I was really excited when Dorothy 6 opened to have somewhere \"different\" to try, instead of the same old waterfront restaurants. The first time I dined there was in December 2014, not long after they opened. We had a group of 7, and we were very impressed by the decor. Cozy and unique, beautiful bar area, large beer selection, etc. The staff seemed friendly as well! Our service was extremely slow, which i attributed to the fact that they had opened very recently, and maybe weren't used to having many \"large\" parties yet, and also because we were seated upstairs (the staff had to walk up alot of steps to reach us). My sister and I both ordered the french onion soup, which was cold when it was served to us (not hot.. not even warm.. ICE COLD). We also both ordered the french dip sandwich.. Mine was OK at best, but very very bland. My sister's meat on her sandwich was so undercooked she couldn't finish half of it. A couple people got the pirogies, which they said were good. But overall, we left disappointed. We decided to give the restaurant another chance last night, and brought a party of 15-20 to celebrate my fiances birthday. We were again seated upstairs, which was completely empty. I was impressed how cooperative the staff was, since we had such a large party with no reservation! However, the food service was again TERRIBLY slow. I have worked in the food industry in the past, and I fully understand how difficult it can be to wait on such a large group.. but there was literally only ONE waitress attempting to take care of us. I don't understand why they wouldn't send her up any help, especially since we were spending a significant amount of money that night. I ordered the soup, pirogies appetizer, and a fish sandwich. My soup and pirogies took (no exaggeration) AN HOUR AND A HALF to come out. Some people in our party even had their entrees before i had my soup (which again, was ice cold). The pirogies WERE good (but very greasy and cold).. but my fish sandwich (which was served 2 hours after I ordered it) was DRY and COLD, along with my fries. When the waitess brought the checks, EVERY SINGLE PERSONS was INCREDIBLY wrong. It was overall (again) a really bad experience. I really wanted to like this place, but after giving them a second chance, I definitely won't be returning to Dorothy 6 cafe (and neither will the many people who were there last night).",

Well, service started out great and first round of drinks were quick.  Then approximately one hour later we were still without food and had no follow-up drinks or visits from our waitress.  When we finally received our food, three out of three burgers were overcooked and even after letting the waitress know, nothing was done to fix this. The waitress asked how the food was and even said sorry for your bad experience, but did not help fix the experience.  First and last visit, food and service were worse than Applebee's with a higher bill.  Love the decor and wish it could have been better.",

We were seated quickly and served efficiently with a warm reception.  What I really liked was that the food was prepared from, best I can tell, real ingredients that were not frozen and processed like I experience in many restaurants in this price range.  I could tell the difference!  I have eaten at many fine restaurants around the world and what I look for really is, was the food fresh, hot and tasty and appropriate portions. The other things I look for is having my water filled up and my beer served cold and not having to wait while I am enjoying my meal.  I have come back a few times and have experienced the great service, tried different courses and have become more enamoured with Dorothy 6.  I will NEVER eat at the Waterfront chain restaurants again.  The times I've been at D6 I felt welcome, but not like I was intruding on a neighborhood bar.  I have written 3 reviews in all my years using Yelp.  One slamming a restaurant, one for a services company and this one.  Stop at Dorothy 6 on your way into the Waterfront, on your way out, or if you are looking for a great restaurant it is worth the drive.  i like unique places and great food and a great beer menu, D6 fits this bill perfectly.",

It's a good addition to the developing Eighth Avenue scene in Homestead, and I genuinely hope they outlast some of the other places along Eighth Avenue in Homestead that had to close down over the years due to the stiff competition from the mainstream chain-heavy Waterfront across the tracks.  I've never been here without enjoying a good meal.  The brunch is especially worthwhile, though I've been there for lunch and late-night drinks as well.  Once, not long after the masterful Purple One passed away, I went and drowned some sorrows in a glass of wine.  They had an amateur band playing upstairs who did a somewhat odd cover of a Prince song as a tribute.   Nice touch to have live music on weekends, but 1) they merit higher-quality performers, and 2) I wish they'd soften the lighting or fancy-up the second floor. It seemed a bit \"unfinished\" when I was there, particularly compared to the ground floor that is so finely attuned to the stated theme of the restaurant.  Interesting decor, and a really cool chandelier that graces the area near the entrance.",

    "text": "Back at the Dorothy 6 again...  Beautiful decor and comfortable ambience brought me back. I sat at the bar and was greeted cheerfully by the bartender. I got a beer (impressive beer selection), and reviewed the menu.   Every entree I've had here has been excellent. My first time in I got the meatloaf and it was delicious... Bacon on top and smothered in gravy. You could tell the mashed potatoes were real (not out of a box) and even the green beans were special. Since then I've had the flat iron steak and the salmon croquettes. Never a disappointment.   Tonight I decided to try a few appetizers for something different: reuban bites and pierogies.  It didn't take long for my order to arrive. To be honest,  the reuban bites were a bit dry for my liking but they weren't horrible and I still ate them (who knows,  you might enjoy them that way). The pierogies, two cheddar and two jalipino, may have been the best pierogies I've ever had.    I just really like this place.  The service is good, the atmosphere is comfortable and the bartender is hard not to like.  I still enjoy the Blue Dust, but this place is going to give them a run for their money and the competition between the two can only benefit the foodie and \"beer snob\" consumers in this area.   If you find yourself in the Homestead area I would highly recommend that you stop into Dorothy 6.",

    "text": "This place finally opened! Have been waiting for quite some time. They were still in soft opening stage, but had most everything together.   Atmosphere: Gorgeous. Industrial feel with a warmth that a blast furnace would give. Minimalist decor with the light fixtures being the attractions and they are varied in style. Plus...OUTDOOR SEATING.  Such a rare commodity in Pittsburgh. Three TVs which is plenty...if I want to watch a game, I'm going to a sports bar. I don't want this place to be that...should be a chill place to drink, converse and relax. Touch tunes juke box.   Drink: Great tap selection and bottles, too. Also a pretty extensive and eclectic liquor choice and just the right amount of wine. I like the display of it mixed through on the large gears on the wall.   Service: We sat at the bar and the bartender was great to offer suggestions, tastes and take notes of what we like to drink.   Food: Tried the spinach artichoke bruschetta. This was really good. Good twist on the all-party appetizer that wasn't too salty. Reuben balls were pretty damn good. Stuffed meatballs were okay...a little overdone, but I imagine they could easily be if you have to make them ahead and keep warm. Not crazy about the marinara with it. I know they'll be playing with the menu a bit.  I hope it stays simple. You don't need a lot of choices, just really good ones.   Overall....this is probably going to be my new hangout. I want this place to make it. 8th avenue needs it and Homestead does, too. Tell your friends!",

I got the gin cocktail with the pickled ginger, which I was very excited about, but it was disappointing. The drink didn't have any cucumbers, ginger, or anything else in it....it must have just been muddled together and then strained. I would have preferred pieces of ginger and cucumber to remain in the drink. Overall, it was bland and didn't have the spicy kick I love with ginger cocktails.   Definitely go for the Reuben and Brussel sprouts, though! That meal, especially at $10, is well worth the visit. My partner deemed it the best Reuben he's ever had.",

There were a decent amount of people in the place with a Hungarian band walking around playing music. The bartenders seemed scattered as I waited for awhile at the bar for a drink. At the table, the server sat down on the booth and apologized for being lazy. No silverware, out of small plates, one of four Hungarian dishes were sold out... My table ordered the remaining three dishes-perogies, stuffed cabbage, bacon and toast. The bacon was very small pieces sprinkled on toast. That was sad. Overall, the food was mediocre and the service slow and unprofessional. I will not bother to return.",

It would have been a wonderful experience if it weren't for the bill. The prices in my opinion are much higher than they should be, perhaps if the portions were larger it may justified.

Waited 15 minutes, then I actually had to lean over the dirty dishes that were still there from the previous bar guests, and ask for a drink. Got the drinks, no suggestion for us to even see a menu. I thought this place might give Honest Johns and 8th & Hays a run for their $$, but there's no way this place can touch the experience the other two local establishments provide.

It was a gorgeous day and we were happy that we didn't have to wait for a table but we were not able to get a table with an umbrella since there are only a few of those. I had the choco zuke french toast sticks as did my friend. We both loved them. So chocolatey and decadent, it was basically eating a dessert for breakfast...which is fine with me! Husband had the potato pancake benedict and he gave it 5 stars. The potato panckes in this dish were perfect. We can't wait to go back and try more brunch dishes because the entire brunch menu looks delicious. Dorothy's patio is dog friendly and they have special dog dishes made with natural ingredients available every day. We ordered the small \"burger\" patty for the dog. It was full of veggies and fresh ingredients and our dog ate it in the blink of an eye! Service was fantastic and friendly. Our drinks and a dog bowl of water were brought promptly and frequently refilled.  We had an excellent meal and service and can't wait to enjoy a great restaurant again.  We know the dog will want to go and get a special treat again too!",

Service was fine and the waitress was pleasant and paced the meal well.

    "text": "Service. It's all about the service, folks...or the lack thereof. I've been anxious to try this relatively new establishment. After all, when I was a kid this area of town was hopping with steel mills, thriving shops, and even a once regal theater. I am always thrilled to see someone trying to do something positive here. But it takes more than the hook of memories.   Nostalgia lines the walls, the rafters, and even the bar. Artifacts of glorious steel days gone by are the backbone of Dorothy's decor. The spot is both warm and gritty, a nice vibe.  We sat at the bar to enjoy a quick cocktail and a salad before heading to Homestead's Carnegie Music Hall for an evening of acoustic Frampton. When we got there, there were plenty of seats both at the bar and surrounding tables. It took a while for our bartender, Lisa, to take our drink orders. She told us she was new and was just learning the ropes there, but the bar manager was overseeing the making of our drinks. Fine by us!   And that's where it all went downhill. We couldn't get her attention to place our orders for dinner...repeatedly. Once the orders were taken - a beet/arugula salad with hangar steak and a wedge salad with chicken - we waited again. And waited. Again.   After waiting approximately half an hour, I asked Lisa when our salads would be ready. Two women to our right gave each other looks and said to us that the kitchen is notoriously slow. I was getting nervous about making the show at this point. But we waited. Again. Another 10-15 minutes later and our salads still hadn't arrived. I asked Lisa to cancel our orders, we had to make the curtain. The tirade I endured from Lisa was inexcusable. She stood there and argued that it couldn't be cancelled, we hadn't been waiting all that long, stomped to the kitchen and came out with our salads. Freaking salads, not a Michelin starred dinner.  I should have just paid for the drinks, but foolishly didn't want to endure any further abuse from Lisa, so just had her box up the salads and left. I have no idea how to rate the food, it's still in my fridge. We barely made it to the concert on time.   Bottom line, don't waste your time or money until the kitchen learns to make a salad in less than 45 minutes and the staff learns how to treat a customer.",

    "text": "TLDR:  potentially cool. Not ready for prime time yet. Owner hates money apparently. Come here in a few months maybe if they can unscrew themselves.   Review:   They get two stars for effort for being in an area that could be so cool and desperately needs some innovative businesses.   Sadly, not yet ready for prime time.   I stopped here with The Wife after Mandatory Shopping. We were looking forward to what we had heard was a new and dynamic eatery.   We walked in. The hostess lady sat us outdoors.  Then three millennia and a couple major client changing  environmental events happened. During this time we never once saw what appeared to be the single server. I told The Wife we should have sat at the bar.   This place has an intriguing menu and a couple decent sounding cocktails. I have no clue what they taste like because after we were seated NO ONE EVER SPOKE TO US AGAIN.   We waited twenty minutes without any contact, beverages or anything. The single sever is single minded. She went to one table and talked to them. Then she went inside. The she delivered something to the table. Then she went inside. Then she came out and talked to another table. Then she went inside and a few minutes later brought that table whatever they discussed. Rinse and repeat.   The hostess lady who I think may be one of the owners did nothing this entire time except talk to the bartender. No other customers came in.   She couldn't be bothered to actually talk or do anything with a customer other than seat them.   I got the impression that these were people who ran a shot and a beer bar for the horribly depressed and desperate when this section of town was at it lowest economic point.   When we eventually got tired and hungry and thirsty enough to leave we walked out and realized that the single sever was being tasked with taking care of the interior first floor, second floor, an outside courtyard while hostess lady did squat.   Maybe if they get enough bad Yelp reviews and find someone to sound out the words in the review for them the owners and managers will unscrew themselves.   In the meantime I sat for twenty minutes and sampled nothing and gave them zero money.   People like this are why everything we buy these days is made in China. Gross American incompetence and laziness.   These people make me sad.",

Usually not the type to complain... & don't get me wrong the bruschetta was delicious (even though i originally asked for  spinach & artichoke dip), but my \"medium well\" burger came out crisp and completely well done. Will never be returning.",

I had heard about it just a week earlier and was dying for some new scenery.  I was also excited to check out a place with some history. I read that much of the bar was created from pieces of metal from Pittsburgh's past.   I absolutely love exposed brick and this place brings it on in the best way possible. Brick, steel, concrete, chandeliers, and pretty string lights. At first glance it looks pretty upscale but after a few minutes you start to realize it's not uptight and in fact is actually very chill. It's a nice change of pace from the nearby chains in the Waterfront or the college-kid filled bars of the South Side.   We had a few other stops planned so we decided to keep it \"light\" and split two apps. We shared the pierogies ($6) (both the cheddar and jalapeno) and the crab cakes ($10). The pierogies were absolutely delish! The crab cakes were good too, good consistency and crab content.   They had a pretty expansive draft list, the bartender was very attentive although there were only 2 other tables in there at the time. The courtyard was absolutely adorable. I love string lights, made it feel whimsical and special.   I think this would make a good date night place as well! Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "I didn't read the reviews for Dorothy 6 (I mainly glanced at the pictures) so I guess I can take some of the blame for deciding to check out their dinner menu two hours before a movie was scheduled for my group. Long story short- We were seated, waited a bit for drinks, waited a bit to order, and then saw our server once to order another drink, the check, and more bread (because we were panicking and starving due to not having any food brought to our table in the hour and a half we had been sitting there.) We also all ran out of water. Womp womp womp.   We eventually got the food, but also arrived to the theater so late that we had to get our prepaid tickets exchanged for a later showing. So that was annoying, but partially my fault for taking us to the restaurant and assuming it would take under two hours to get food and eat :/   I think they need to hire another server. Or develop a different system. Or I just can't go to Dorothy 6 if I have something planned afterward.  But anyway- Whatever flavor making is going on in the kitchen is on point. The bruschetta was amazing. The crab cakes were actual crab and the hash that came with was delightful. My friends seemed to like their dinner and the breakfast food I've had there has been good as well. The only issue I've ever had with the food is that the portion sizes have been on the smaller side.   I like Dorothy 6 and will hopefully make it back to the restaurant again soon, but I definitely won't do it if I'm in a hurry.",

Traveling on business, I found this gem thanks to other Yelp users and decided to give it a try. The service was phenomenal, and the food was a bargain.  I had the special, a generous filet with polenta and the bacon Brussel sprouts. The plate I got was simply presented without fanfare. The filet was perfect, the polenta was great, but the best flavor was the sprouts. I will most definitely return to this locally owned spot in a town that needs more places like this.",

Despite the fancy pants decor, the vibe was laid-back and casual, so I wasn't the least bit self-conscious in my columbia fleece and yoga pants. Note: Stretchy pants are essential if you plan to stuff yourself with pierogi.  We arrived around 6:30 on a Saturday and there were only two other parties in the downstairs area, so we got seated right away.   We ordered a sample of the pierogi for our appetizer ($6): One cheddar, one jalepeno, and one bacon. These pierogi are legit. All were delicious in their own way, but the jalepeno really stole the show.   The Reuben I ordered was a solidly good sandwich ($10) and my husband's flat iron steak was melt in your mouth tender ($17). I also really enjoyed my husband's brussel sprout side dish ... to the point where he had to defend his plate with his utensils.   I don't know why anyone would opt for a Waterfront chain restaurant when there is a place like this just over the railroad tracks. We'll be back for sure.",

This is the 2nd time we have been to the restaurant before a show at the music library theater. Each time we had a reservation at least 2 1/2 hours before the show. It took an hour and a half for our food to arrive. The first time we had to take our food in boxes as we would miss the show. This time after finishing our food we were relaxing, talking & having good conversation when our server asked us to leave as they needed the table. We were astonished as there were tables available & very few people waiting for a table. We were very disappointed to say the least.

Great craft brews on draft and a friendly bartender serving them. I ordered the pierogies and they were really tasty.  However, the pricing seems off here.  I can't remember the exact prices, but it was cheaper to order more pierogies from the appetizer menu than it was to order it as an entree.

Even the bread with butter.. the butter is whipped with honey and it pairs well with the warm bread. I would buy it by the gallon if I could. We ordered the cheddar pierogies as an appetizer. They had a nice peppery kick and were perfectly cooked, served with a side of herbed sour cream. Our appetizers, the meatloaf and the crab cakes, were delicious.   I took away two stars due to the ambience. This place doesn't know whether it wants to be fancy or your neighborhood bar. The beautiful chandelier when you walk in is a nice touch alongside the more rustic elements... but I could have done without the jukebox blaring Creed and Ke$ha for the entirety of our meal.

Now for the important features of this bar restaurant. They have a great rotating craft beer selection on tap. The menu is not huge but representative towards most tastes. The crab cakes and meatloaf come to mind. My wife and I are small eaters and we usually get a small beet salad with a piece of salmon on top. For ten bucks you'll not find a better salad of mixed greens and yellow and red beets. I don't who their fish supplier is but we have never got a better piece of salmon anywhere.

    "text": "If you're like me, you are looking through the reviews for Dorothy 6, seeing the mix of 1-2's and 4-5's and wondering why there is such a mix of opinions.  After taking my boyfriend, Dale, to Dorothy 6 for his birthday last night, here is my insight:  Food & drinks:  5 stars Value/Affordability:  5 stars Atmosphere:  4 stars Service:  1 star  The food and cocktails were wonderful.  We started with the Spinach & Artichoke Bruschetta, which was fantastic - topped with goat cheese, balsamic, bacon...mmm bacon is a key ingredient at Dorothy 6!  We followed the appetizer with the Crispy Chicken Parmesan for me, Dorothy Flat Iron Steak for him.  The breading on the chicken was delicious, as was the marinara sauce and pasta.  Dale ordered his steak rare, and it came out perfectly done.  He subbed in the brussel sprouts for the veggies that typically come with the flat iron steak, and what a great decision that was - topped with bacon and deliciousness.  To accompany our food, we each had an Old Fashioned, which were well made.  Dale also had a draft (the Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Stout - a great beer from the restaurant's reasonably diverse offering of drafts) and I had a Smokestack Martini (dessert in a glass) to round out our evening.  The atmosphere is good.  It seems like the restaurant hasn't fully decided \"what it is\" yet, as there is a little bit of a clash between the cool brick walls and art, the fun chandeliers, and the kind of cheap banquet hall-style chairs and tables.  I suspect that as the restaurant develops, the style and atmosphere will evolve further.  The pricing is very affordable.  Our bill came to about $75 - for an appetizer, two entrees, three craft cocktails, and a decent beer, it doesn't get much better than that.  Here's why you see the 1-2 star reviews:  The service is abysmal.  The restaurant was not busy while we were there, but the wait staff was not attentive.  It took a long time just to get water after we were seated.  When our food eventually came out, we ultimately grabbed sets of silverware from a nearby table as we did not have any and our waitress didn't return to our table for another 10 minutes or so. Asking for additional water for another drink throughout our meal was a challenge, as our waitress returned our table very infrequently and spent a lot of time with her back turned to us, talking to the bartender.  I think next time we will sit at the bar in hopes of better service.    If you are not in a hurry - perhaps you're looking for a place to relax and eat a good meal or have some cocktails after some time in the Waterfront, I would highly recommend Dorothy 6.  However, if you have a deadline (e.g., if you are planning to see a movie within the next hour at the theater), I would probably choose another place.    Overall though - let's revisit how awesome the food and drinks were.  The food truly was outstanding, the cocktails were well made, and the prices were very affordable.  If Dorothy 6 improves on service, this could easily be a 5 star restaurant.  It is a great addition to Homestead, and I am looking forward to returning.",

I've been a few times now and everyone I've taken with me has had the same reaction - \"when can we go back\"  Bill at the bar is fantastic - he's incredibly creative with drinks and the beer selection is great as well, something for every preference.  The pierogis are authentic and delicious and the Brussels sprouts with bacon - just yes, you need to get them.  My boyfriend who does not eat Brussels sprouts has ordered them every time we've gone.  The Reuben is possibly the best I've had - the dressing just out of this world and the steak is one of those steaks that you don't want any type of sauce anywhere near it because the meat and seasoning speak for itself.  It's a hidden gem in Homestead and you'll want to try it out.",

    "text": "I don't like flowery, long winded, pretentious reviews by hipster wannabe food critics so I'll get to the brass tacks.  Ambiance: decor and music was perfect Booze: great selection of beer and cocktails Food: I had an 8oz strip steak with mashed potatoes and caramelized baconized Brussels sprouts. I ordered my steak med-rare and it was tender and delicious but a little more on the medium side but really that was okay with me, the Brussels sprouts were cooked perfectly--firm and not squishy but they could've used a little salt, there was something kind of off about the mashed potatoes though, they sort of reminded me of the ones I had in my high school cafeteria but my husband loved them. My husband had the pierogies, also with the Brussels sprouts and they were awesome! Like the best pierogies I've ever had, actually.  Service: We sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and attentive, I saw him creating custom cocktails for other patrons and if I had not already been drinking beer I probably would've asked him to make me one. I feel that if I had been upset about the steak being a teensy bit overcooked and not liking the mashed pots, he would've done something about it cheerfully.   Overall, the experience was pleasant and any kinks are small and will be smoothed out over a bit of time, I'm so excited that they've opened in my neighborhood.",

Their happy hour is a solid offer especially since it spans into the weekend. Two issues prevent it from becoming my go to place. 1)Lack of True veg options. Besides salads and perogies, there's no solid veg entree/main course options. If this were a bar food place, that'd be an easy pass. However, it's a deal breaker for me for newer places. 2) staffing. The bartender is running most of the tables but I see at 2-3 other staff members standing around in a huddle while tables are clearly looking to place food and drink orders.",

    "text": "Let's talk about Homestead for a second before I get into the review. I love it. Lots of history, and it's an area which is clearly going to be changing in the next few years. It's taken longer than most, but with places like Dorothy 6, Honest John's and the new brewery which is in the works, things appear to be looking up. This is a good thing.  Dorothy 6, where to begin? We called ahead and asked if they were busy and could take guests, we were told to come on in. We parked and we were greeted promptly. We were asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside on their patio. We chose inside as it looked as if rain was coming. Next time we go we will definitely be sitting on the patio as it's awesome. There's a brick wall covered in ivy, what more can one ask for?  Dorothy 6 has twenty beers on draft and they clearly rotate. I wasn't a fan of a majority of what they had, but I did find a winner. My girl had a Moscow mule and it was really damn good as well.  We decided to try the bruschetta appetizer, which is a bit different than your standard bruschetta, but it was good. Maybe a little salty due to the goat cheese but not bad. The whole grain bread that it was on was awesome however.  We were told the specials by our server who happened to be the bartender as well. I ordered the special which was cabbage rolls. I love a good cabbage roll. She ordered the perogies, 2 jalapeno, three cheddar. With hers came crispy Brussels sprouts with bacon. She loved the Brussels sprouts and so did I. They were top notch. She also tried a side of their house made corned beef. She didn't care for it because she could taste the pickling liquid. I personally loved the corned beef.  Back to the cabbage rolls...they never made it to the table. They had actually oversold them and I missed the boat. I was asked what I would like in place of it and they offered to buy. I chose the meatloaf. It arrived in less than a minute. They had an order come up and sent it out immediately. I'm glad I did. It was probably the best I'd ever ate. The gravy was excellent. It wasn't over cooked and dry. The bacon which wrapped it was a bit flimsy but that's not a big deal. The mashers were good which accompanied it. The veggies were fresh green beans with fresh halved tomatoes. It hit the spot.  Very seldom does a restaurant recover from a blunder like that, and they did it effortlessly.  Will absolutely return!",

The service is good and you can sample the different beers before deciding which one you want.   There is music coming from somewhere and there are three or more TVs on the wall showing sports.

My bf ordered steak and eggs minus the eggs (the psychopath hates eggs, like a psychopath). The steak was cooked well and it came with tasty potatoes. All around delicious!",

    "text": "Three strikes, it's out for me.  The first time I came, I was with a big party and the wait for food was over 40 minutes. Since we were with a bigger party, I was completely understanding. The second time I visited, my boyfriend and I had dinner here. Again, longer wait, and I was a little annoyed at that point. However, when I saw a Facebook notification for their \"Jazzy Christmas Eve Brunch\", I thought it sounded wonderful and that we should give them one more try. I made our reservation for 1:00 pm, however, due to the nature of the busy Christmas holiday, I called around 11:00 am that morning to see if there was any possibility that we could arrive earlier. The woman on the phone was hesitant (although she did not explain why) but told us we could arrive at 12:15. We arrived a little early, as it literally only takes us around 6 minutes to drive here from our house. It wasn't that busy and we were sat right away and ordered our meals by 12:13. The jazz musician was wonderful- very friendly and he played wonderful music. Had it not been for him we wouldn't have been able to wait the 50 minutes it took for our food to come out. Again, the place wasn't that busy. I ordered a typical breakfast- two eggs, white toast, home fries, and turkey sausage. Brendan ordered the Eggs Benedict with home fries. We also both ordered drinks- Brendan had iced coffee (which tasted old) and I had a bloody mary (not bad- but nothing special at all- completely opposite of how the drink menu describes it). Now, it's not just the wait that is frustrating. If I had to wait 50 minutes for the best meal of my life, or close to it, ok. But waiting for 50 minutes for less than average food is a waste of time. The portion of home fries Brendan received was embarrassing- maybe 10 little pieces of fried potatoes. It looked like they were just dropped into a deep fryer, they were dry and there was no veggies like peppers or onions with them. The Eggs Benedict was even more embarrassing. I wish I had taken a photo, but frankly we were starving by the time our food came out and we were too disappointed in our experience to take a photo. The Eggs Benedict was served on English muffins- tiny piece of ham on each one, over done poached egg and barely any hollandaise sauce. It was the poorest excuse for Eggs Benedict that I have ever seen. My breakfast was below average as well- the white bread was so incredibly dry that I didn't even want to eat it, the home fries were bland and dry, the sausage was fine though and my over easy eggs were cooked correctly. We just wanted to get out of there, but I decided to talk to our server and inquire about the wait. The server was obviously disappointed in the establishment and informed me that this is a reoccurring problem. The kitchen here is too small to serve a large amount of people, yet the managers insist on booking many reservations. The result is incredibly long wait times on food and food not being prepared the way it should be. The server was great and attentive the entire time, as much as she could be, as she also had a table upstairs. Not one aspect of our below average experience has to do with the service we received. After paying, I decided to speak with a manager to express my disappointment in our visit. I talked about the 50 minute wait time, and the below average food. The manager was not surprised at the wait at all, and mentioned their small kitchen problem. I informed him that this should not be a reoccurring issue and should be taken as a learning experience for the restaurant. Especially on a holiday weekend, people should be warned about the long wait time before making a reservation or even being seated. Speaking to the manager did not change my feelings about this place at all.   I really love the new business scene in Homestead and do my best to support these businesses as often as I can. However, I will not waste my time and come to Dorothy 6 again.",

    "text": "We came here for Brunch this past Sunday.  Dorothy's has been one of those places I have been wanting to try for some time now, but we just honestly don't make too many trips to Homestead.  The brunch menu caught my eye and I am happy we tried it.    We sat in the downstairs bar area at a high top.  Our servers were the two lady bartenders.  Once seated we received menus right away, but it took our waitress a little longer than expected to return for drink orders, especially since the menu is one page.  I went with the Hail Mary while my husband was feeling some tequila sunrise.  The Bloody was one of the tastiest ones I have had in a while.  The house made mix was a perfect balance of citrus and spice and they garnish the drink well.  I really enjoyed my drink.    After our drinks were delivered we ordered our entrees.   I went with the eggs benedict with crab, and Matt decided on the potato pancake eggs benedict with bacon.  We kicked back and continued to enjoy our drinks until our food arrived.  I felt the time between ordering and receiving for food and drinks was a tad on the excessive side, but both waitresses were wonderful and very helpful when they did make it to our table.  We had completed both our drinks before our food was served, so we waited a bit to order another.  I went with an Irish coffee.  I was a bit disappointed in my Irish coffee as it only had Jamison in it.  I am used to ordering Irish coffee's that come with Jamison, Bailey's and whipped cream.  Now after I ordered I asked for no whipped cream, but I guess their idea of an Irish coffee is whisky and black coffee.  It will put hair on your chest!  Lesson learn, always ask never assume.  I added a decent amount of cream to make it drinkable and our food arrived.  My eggs benedict were delicious, and I am so happy I went with the crab.  If I had to make one comment it was that the one egg was slightly over to medium hard poach and I missed that yummy egg yolk flow over my English muffin.   Everything was seasoned wonderfully and they potatoes that accompanied my meal were quite nice.  My portion was perfect for me but for my husband seemed to be a little on the smaller side.  You may want to think about ordering some additional sides to accompany your dish depending on your order.  We would definitely return for brunch and maybe dinner sometime.",

The Waterfront is a great shopping area, but it lacking in the restaurant vibe (chain, chain, chain).  Head a few block over the train tracks to a little street called 8th Ave.  There is a quaint eatery called Dorothy 6.  The interior is unassuming with little relics of the steel industry placed throughout:  the tap handles, the small framed art.  Look around and there is some real history there. Industrial and hip meet and make a great pair.  Don't overlook the great patio in the warm days.  We started with the pierogies.  My advice, just get the jalapeno for all three, they have just the right amount of kick...a little zing at the end but nothing too spicy.  We ordered the Firehouse Burger, the Meatloaf and a side of Brussel sprouts.  All had great tastes and the gravy on my meatloaf could have been poured all over my plate.  What a great flavor.    The best part about the evening was the service.  Prompt, kind, (but not fake).  Our food was timed perfectly and drinks were made with the quickness.  (A pretty stellar beer list, I might add)",

We were promptly met at the door - offered inside or outside seating.  Chose outside since it was a nice evening.  Nice set-up.  Tables with umbrellas; well spaced.  While service was a tad slow - the server was nice and hard-working (he had a few other tables one of which was a table of 12).  The drinks were well made.  Appetizers were presented nicely and tasted great.  Had the stuffed banana peppers and crab dip.  Everyone in our group enjoyed their meal - Fireman's burger, Rueben, French Dip and Flat Iron Steak.  All were fantastic.  Made the wait well worth it.  Two in our group ordered dessert - they were raving about the Apple Cake.  We prefer small local places like this versus all the chain restaurants that are in the area.  We will definitely come back.    Very impressed with Dorothy 6.",

They were friendly and accommodating, seating us right away and adjusting an errant spotlight that was pointed right at my head.     Service was great all the way through.  Drinks came promptly and she offered samples as needed.   She even came around and asked if we wanted another round before happy hour ended.     Food was great as well, though I'd definitely have ordered differently if I'd know how big the portions were.   We started with the mozzarella stuffed meatballs.  They were good on their own, but the side of sauce really finished the dish - could have used a bit more of that.   The boyfriend ordered the meatloaf and loved it. The gravy was a reduced French onion, which was really good, though we both wanted to experiment with the meatball sauce.   I ordered the pierogi dinner.   After the appetizer and a glass (or two) of wine, I actually struggled to finish it - the portions are decent sized.   I'd either skip the app next time or order the smaller plate of pierogis.  I sampled all three varieties of pierogi.  Cheddar was the best, followed closely by jalapeno.  The beer one was my least favorite, with a bit of a bitter aftertaste.   I'd order the other two again as well as the brussels, which were very good.    A little pricey for Homestead, but the food and service stood up, so I didn't deduct a star.",

    "text": "I need to begin this review by stating: I hate Brussel sprouts.  As a child, my father would serve them to my brothers and I, but we did whatever we could to avoid them... hunger strikes at the dinner table, temper-tantrums, or simply slipping them into a napkin and pretend to have finished our meal.    As I grew older, I was open to trying them again since my taste buds evolved to enjoy vegetables like broccoli and beets.  Unfortunately, Brussel sprouts left me wanting to scrub my tongue with a toothbrush and mouthwash in order to rid my mouth of the flavor.  When ordering at Dorothy 6, I saw that Brussel sprouts were serves as a side to most dishes.  My burger came with fries, but my boyfriend's meal came with a side of Brussel sprouts.  My burger was simply perfect - juicy, pink, and filled with flavor.  I couldn't have asked for anything better.  Perhaps that's what made me feel adventurous... I grabbed my fork and sampled my boyfriend's Brussel sprouts... I was in love!  How could this be?  My entire life I have despised Brussel sprouts.  The thought of them would make me gag in horror.  Now after trying the sprouts served at Dorothy 6, I crave them!  Where have they been all my life?!    I would go back to Dorothy 6 Blast Furnace Cafe for many reasons: great beer, amazing burgers, pierogis... Now Brussel sprouts are added to that list.  Thank you, Dorothy 6 for changing my mind and mouth about Brussel sprouts.",

    "text": "This review is going to have a lot of qualifications in it. I wanted to be able to give Dorothy 6 four stars, but my first visit to this cafe was on what I am gathering, at least hoping, was \"a totally off night\". I'd still give them 3 1/2 if I could, although I know there would have been patrons (especially if they were in a hurry) who would have left before eating & gave this place one star if they'd had my actual experience.   I went on a Sunday evening around 6:15pm, thinking it would be less crowded & it was, maybe 5 tables & 3 bar patrons when I entered. I was immediately asked if I wanted a table or to sit at the bar & since my friends ended up not being able to make it, I chose the bar. I did notice the server seemed slightly flustered by my choice of the bar. Within 10 minutes I knew why. They did not have a bartender that night. I sat for 10 or so minutes, did not receive a menu, no one asked if I needed one or if I wanted a drink. Odd. Luckily I wasn't in a hurry, but I did consider leaving at one point. Then a group of 3 people came in & sat next to me at the bar. I noticed they received menus right away, and wondered if I was perhaps invisible? But it was probably another 15 min before the server came back to take their drink orders and at which point I blurted out \"I'd like a drink too!\" She then said she thought we were together. I also asked for a menu. The server seemed extremely flustered. Another server came to help her get our drinks since the first server disappeared after taking our drink order. But not being a bartender, I am sure mixing cocktails can be an issue. But I only ordered a bottle of Miller Lite, so that should have been easy.   Anyway, the folks next to me were very nice & we chatted amongst ourselves and soon found out from server #2 that the bartender didn't show up tonight & on top of that, everyone else that worked there was over at Kennywood for Pierogi Fest! So short staffed was an understatement. We started to feel sorry for server #1 who looked like she was ready to cry she was so overwhelmed. We told her to relax, it wasn't her fault & none of us were in a big hurry.   So, eventually we got our orders taken & received our food & a second round of drinks. I had ordered last & received my food first because there was also a kitchen snafu! But the food was good & hot, I had the D6 burger which was cooked medium as requested & was fresh and tasty.   I spoke with the owner, Tom, when he got back from Pierogi Fest and he told me that actually 2 employees called off this day. He explained that he secured or hand made much of what was in the cafe, all related to the steel mills of Pittsburgh. The decor is great, there are 3 beautiful stained glass windows in front, a poured concrete bar with inlaid with company logos of various mills, artwork by Pgh artist Rick Bach (think Mad Mex art), a huge crystal chandelier, exposed brick walls. There is an upstairs area for private parties or overflow seating and a cute outdoor patio with string lights and a fire pit.   Anyway, I liked the menu choices, I liked the look & vibe of the place & my food was good & my bottle of beer was cold. They also have a cocktail menu & the folks beside me loved their apple cherry mules. There are many craft beers on tap. Two TV's above the ends of the bar to watch the games.   They did give us all our first round of drinks on the house for waiting, which was nice. By the time I left I felt so bad for our poor server having to wait tables, bartend & play hostess that I way overtipped her, gave her a hug & told her to have a good night. It really was not her fault. My motto is \"If you can be anything, be kind\". So, I hope to give Dorothy 6 another try so that perhaps their 3 stars will move up to 4 or so based on my next experience.   It is definitely a place to try when on 8th Ave in Homestead & definitely more unique than any chain you'll find at the Waterfront.",

Menu online looked small, but selection in the restaurant was better... some additional choices. Pierogi appetizer was fantastic; great flavor and perfectly cooked. Everyone also loved the food. It seemed to take awhile between the appetizer and entrees, but the quality of the meal made the wait seem okay. Will be back. Waitress was great too. Friendly enough without overdoing it.",

    "text": "I'm knocking Dorothy one star for the service during my one experience there. Let's get that out of the way now. Everything else was so good that I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and I'd be easily persuaded to come back. When we came in, the hostess told us up front it would be half an hour before we'd get our food (spoiler alert: it took longer). So we kinda knew it was probably an off night for them right from the jump. I can't get too mad about that since we were warned in advance and still proceeded to sit down. What struck me as odd was that after our drink order was taken it was almost half an hour before they arrived. Our server mumbled something about it being the bartenders fault, but she was mostly MIA during this and we struggled to get her attention when we did see her. Maybe they were just short-staffed across the board, but it wasn't that busy, and we were waiting on two drafts, not a round of seven unique and intricate cocktails. So mistakes were made. Let's move on.  As you probably expected, Dorothy 6 was an old blast furnace, and the restaurant pays homage well. The interior is visually impressive with a modern industrial feel. They have a private bar and event room upstairs you can reserve and outdoor seating in the summer. This place would feel right at home in Lawrenceville or the Strip District, but you can get the hipster vibe here with less of the crowd.  The beer selection is solid. They have twenty taps and a few specialty cocktails. For my meal, I ordered a steak. It was cooked as requested with a side of glazed brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes. We had an appetizer of pierogis that we enjoyed.  I'd love to give this place four or even five stars, but I just can't based on my first trip. If the issues were an anomaly and I came back to have a great meal without any hiccups, I'd gladly change it. For now, I'll just say this place has the potential to be better than anything the waterfront offers.",

    "text": "Ordered: Potato Benedict + Zucchini French Toast Price: $10 + 7  Ambiance: Wife and I say on the patio since it was a nice day out, the tables were spaced generously and our server set up an umbrella so the sun wasn't an issue for us. Service was friendly enough but definitely on the slower side, especially considering the inside was completely empty and there were only 4 other tables seated in the patio area. Food took ~30-40 minutes to come out.   Food: This is where Dorothy's excels. There aren't a lot of options for their brunch menu but what they do, they do well. The potato benny was on the grey side (sign of pre-cut potatoes oxidizing in air) but the outside was excellently crisped and the insides well-seasoned. The fat from the sausage links I ordered with it saturated the potatoes with delicious salty and savory fat which was awesome. The hollandaise sauce was very light and thin which just added moisture without making the dish excessively heavy. The zucchini french toast was also excellent with a very rich chocolately flavor and light airy crumb, it was like eating fried cake for breakfast. We didn't even use the maple syrup provided with the dish.  Overall we were glad we have Dorothy's a chance and really did enjoy the food but we'll be cautious to allow time for food to arrive.",

The meatloaf could easily serve two - it's a huge chunk of meaty goodness a little heavy on the garlic but enjoyable nonetheless.  Our server, Nicole, was very nice and kept up with our needs by stopping by every so often.  The Cafe is a nice addition to the strip.",

    "text": "My wife has mentioned a few times that she wanted to go here for brunch and we finally got to come here.  There is street parking here but it can be a little difficult to find parking during prime time hours here.  We made reservations ahead of time.  We didn't actually use them because we just walked into the bar area and found a small table across from the bar.  I still recommended reservations for brunch here.       We got here at 1pm and we hadn't eaten yet for the day so we were quite hungry.  The bartender was a little busy but she greeted us right away and she said she would get to us in just a second.  She gave us their brunch menu that we had already checked out a head of time but we looked over it again.  They have a nice brunch menu.  There were 3 or 4 things that I wanted to try.  I was hungry so I wanted to try something that would keep me full throughout the day.  I wanted some pancakes too but I didn't want to be too full for our Sunday Funday!       We ordered our drinks first.  My wife got an Irish coffee and I got a tequila sunrise.  I usually don't get drinks like that but I just felt like I wanted that type of drink.  It was a good drink.  Not strong but it tasted good.  I actually didn't have another drink after this one.   Carrie ordered their eggs benedict with crab and I got the Potato Pancake benedict with bacon on it.  We waited a long time for our food.  That is probably my only complaint here but getting food that is really good but takes awhile to make isn't a bad thing and I think that's what happened here.       So our food came out and they both looked great!  Carrie's eggs benedict was good but her poached eggs were dry unfortunately.  My poached eggs were perfect so I let her use some of my yoke.  The crab that she added to her order looked so good and she said it was a great combination.  My potato pancake benedict was so good.  The bacon was crispy and worked great with my runny poached eggs.  It just wasn't enough for me.  I needed another potato pancake or something to go with this meal.  (You were right Carrie I should have ordered those Pancakes too!) I'm sure we will be back again and I will order more next time.        The atmosphere here was nice too.  The bar is open and the floors look great and they have a really nice chandelier to look at.  Overall it was a great brunch date with my wife and we are looking forward to coming her again for brunch or dinner.  Thanks Dorothy!",

The service was also very good...server was super friendly and attentive and everything came out quickly.   The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because of the prices. It was almost $50 for 2 entrees and a cup of soup. No drinks, no dessert, no alcohol. For a casual bar/restaurant their prices are about 25% too high, in my opinion.",

They have a nice outdoor patio but since Pittsburgh was being incinerated by a solar flare over the weekend, we opted to stay in the blessed A/C.  Pros: *Our server was friendly and smiling. Our server explained the daily special AND gave us the price. I don't know about you but I feel like I shouldn't have to ask the price of any specials. It should come with the description of the dish. *The beet & arugula salad was delicious. Truth be told, I have always detested beets - especially pickled beets - but I loved this. The salad had thinly sliced red and golden beets, creamy Feta, dried cherries, and crisp sliced almonds. My husband and I couldn't get enough! The small portion was perfect for a starter. *The cajun seared salmon was juicy and not overdone. Sides of shredded roasted Brussels sprouts were good (could have used a little more seasoning) and the mashed potatoes were buttery and decadent. *Cool art on the wall, gorgeous chandeliers, and vintage steel mill artifacts make it a unique environment *On a super hot day, lots of water refills without asking were much welcomed  Cons: *Parking can be tough - might have to drive around a bit before you spot a spot - but it's worth the effort! *An expanded dessert menu would be nice - only two items at this time  We'll definitely be back for more.",

The stuffed meatball appetizer was ok but I wouldn't say it was really memorable. The crab cakes dinner was better and an enjoyable experience--everything tasted fresh and of a reasonable quality. They were also able to answer a few questions I had to avoid some allergies etc. I sampled the pierogies, which also tasted good. Service was good.  So, definite thumbs up.",

My son told me that he won't be coming back again (and either will I) after having the worst mother's day lunch experience EVER.  The manager was loud and rude, and if I were one of her employees, I'd be tempted to punch her right in the face because of the way she was treating them. (Right in front of the customers, no less...)  OK lady, I get it.  You're stressed and you suck at your job, so maybe you shouldn't be working in the hospitality business.  The place supposedly has really good food, but the lunch buffet we experienced was overpriced run-of-the-mill crap.  We were told that we couldn't order off of the menu, so it was the buffet or nothing.  It's understandable that on a busy lunch holiday that a restaurant might have a limited menu, and I might have come back to try out food from the regular menu if it were not for the awful experience our party had on mother's day.  There are plenty of places around town with nice taps, but I'll give this place 2 stars for the solid tap selection.",

I started with mozzarella stuffed meatballs that were succulent and dripped melted cheese when cut in to. Dipped in a traditional sauce, they left nothing to be desired.  Main dish was crab stuffed herb crusted salmon with fresh green beans and cubed potatoes.  I'm so glad I didn't add salt or pepper before trying everything because the beans were seasoned and cooked to melt in my mouth; the potatoes were just the right amount of crunchy without being offensive; but the piece-de-resistance was the crab stuffed salmon, so tender and yet crispy at the same time.  But don't take my word for it, get on in there if you're in Pittsburgh.",

Homestead is so close to the city that it's really convenient to swing by whether shopping at the Waterfront or just out for a day of exploring. I will see that they can get super busy with brunch so reservations may be a good idea.  The industrial design and decor is fantastic with everything from paintings and sculptures by my friend Rick Bach to tin ceilings, antique crystal chandeliers, repurposed pieces from local (now closed) steel mills and more.  They have an amazing selection of local and craft beers on tap as well as your traditional mainstream beers.  We really love having brunch here but stopped by the other day for a flight. The service was friendly and I look forward to our next visit.",

We had a show to go to up the street so my trusty sidekick went to yelp and found this place close by to eat before the show and wow everything was great!    Loved the interior - felt warm and inviting - we were downstairs at a high top and were able to appreciate the beautiful chandeliers and eclectic artwork hanging on the walls.  Our waitress was a doll - so friendly and attentive and kept things moving so we wouldn't be late for our show.  We ordered a round of specialty drinks and holy cow were they delicious.  Sometimes things sound good on the menu but when you get them they're awful - all 3 of our drinks were amazing!    As for food - loved both the beet salad and the Brussels sprouts (it had bacon in it!!). Our table ordered the meatloaf dinner (total comfort food) and shrimp and cheesy grits.  Thee was a light coating on the shrimp that made it so light and crunchy it was delicious.  We had a really great time here and the food was super tasty.  The owner came over to check and make sure everything was good (it was!) and told us they've been there for 4 years!  How did I miss this place for so many years?  Will absolutely be back!",

The ambiance is a fun mix of historic steel mill items and items, and for some reason there's this crazy huge crystal chandelier. My husband got the beer flight and appreciated the wide variety of beers on tap. I had a cherry apple mule, which was quite tasty. We both had the flank steak, which came with roasted green beans (delicious) and mashed potatoes. I thought that the potatoes were lacking and quite bland- no creaminess. The flank steak was nicely cooked- a good \"crust\" but still deliciously medium rare inside. Our server was good and friendly, but he had too many tables. Overall, we were very pleased with our choice. Good to avoid the chain restaurants in the Waterfront. Prices were also quite reasonable.",

Unfortunately, tonight was not the right circumstances. We had 5pm reservations before a 7pm show right up the street at the Carnegie Library of Homestead. I was there early but they wouldn't seat us until the whole party arrived. Not really a problem as I sat at the bar for a drink. The draft list was impressive. Or at least I believe it was because I didn't recognize a single beer on it! It took a very long time to find someone to order from. From my count, there were 5 people working divided between hosting, bartending and waiting tables both upstairs and downstairs. My party arrived at 5:15 and our table wasn't ready because another party hadn't left. At that point we were told that it would be 45 minutes for food. We just wanted to get to our show on time. They then sat us upstairs. We waited about 15 minutes before anyone came to the table. When she did she was very nice, apologetic and clearly overworked. We gave our food and drink orders together. We all split meals so that made everything move faster. It came out timely, less than the 45-minutes we were warned it would take, and everyone enjoyed their food. I split the fish sandwich and fries. It was very good and half was quite filling.   The decor was great. Downstairs atmosphere cooler than upstairs but I imagine upstairs would be great for a private party if they rent it out or reserve it. The drink list was good and food that I tried was too (everyone seemed happy with their food). If they can hire more staff I think this would be a great option for food and drinks in Homestead.",

This place is what gives the city of Homestead it's heart and soul, and should not be taken for granted.  Chain restaurants are a dime a dozen in the area, and certainly led to the revitalization of this former steeltown.   However, it's as equally important to recognize and support family-owned and operated establishments whose heritage traces back to the very families who worked in the local steel mills. In fact, if you wish to experience a small taste of what makes this place so special to this town, plan to come here on Hungarian Night to feast on a menu that features olde world recipes.  The night also features live music provided by The Gypsy Strings.  Well worth the trip to cross the bridge!",

    "text": "A group of us went here for my birthday last weekend to try something new. There is street parking and we easily found a spot and headed over to meet the rest of our group.  We were seated upstairs at a large table off to the side...I believe they said it seats 12. The restaurant has a huge chandelier and tons of artwork giving it a very cool vibe.  The service was not very good but the food was...that is why I gave it 4 stars. The server seemed overwhelmed and the whole experience took 2.5hrs which was fine cause we weren't in a hurry but still waited a long time for food.   My boyfriend and I ordered the banana peppers...they were out so we switched to the crab dip but were brought the bruschetta....when she asked if that was correct and we said no she did not offer to correct it. That being said....it was amazing and we were happy with this minor error. We then ordered the burger and butternut squash ravioli....when our food came out I was given an asparagus and mushroom ravioli...not a huge deal but she sat it down and never gave the opportunity to ask what happened with the original order. Because we had waited so long I dug in and was again pleasantly surprised with a dish I was not expecting.  They allowed us to bring in an outside cake and even helped to take some pictures. All in all it was a great place...next time I am just looking forward to trying some of the food I order haha.",

You'll feel the artsy vibe as soon as you walk in the door. The art work, brick and huge chandelier tie the whole place together.   We were the only party in the upstairs loft space. Plus side, we had the entire thing to ourselves. Downside, service was super slow and not attentive at all. After placing our orders our server told us they were out of several things. We reordered and then waited.... we chatted the entire time so I hardly noticed how long it was taking until one of our group members brought it up. When our orders did arrive several items were incorrect. We waited so long we didn't care so we ate everything.   I really wanted to love this space, but the service was so low and most of our orders were wrong. I can't see myself going out of the way to visit again.",

There was only one other table of people there so they weren't busy at all. My husband was ready to leave and go to the place next door when someone finally came out of the back. When we sat down it took another 40 minutes for our food to come. It was 1pm. They had opened a couple hours before. It wasn't like they were just firing up the kitchen.  I ordered the crab cake sandwich. It had pickled onions on it which were delicious. I had fries as my side and the sandwiches come with a crisp pickle. My husband ordered the meatball sandwich because it was a house special. He was told there were no meatballs. Interesting. So then he ordered the reuben which he said was really good. The food itself was excellent. 5 stars. I bumped down because the service was so bad. It really was a disappointing experience after reading all the great reviews.  There is metered parking out front. You get 30 min for a quarter. If you plan to come here for lunch, plan to spend a lot of time as it takes forever.",

The bar looks to be mail with rails from tracks and, of course, the chandelier is beautiful.  The food is normally very good. I love their proper Rueben. The butternut squash ravioli is delightful. The pork schnitzel is delicious. The prices are very fair for the sandwiches. Some of the entrees and beer are a bit pricey.  My only suggestion for improvement would be the service is sometimes in need of improvement. Regardless, great addition to Homestead and I wish them continued success!",

My peach old fashioned was nothing special. There were enough interesting items on the menu that we will have to come back to try them. Parking was easy one block south of the restaurant.",

I wasn't able to see the upstairs section at the time, as it was closed, but was told that it should be available for parties in the future. The bartender was very pleasant, and took me outside and showed me their outdoor space. He told me of places for a firepit, and seating/tables in the warmer months. The draft selection is very good - I believe that there were about 16+ craft beers on tap. The food was the highlight of the night, tho. I got salmon cakes, pierogies, brussel sprouts - all of which were cooked perfectly, and the brussel sprouts were amazing. Quite possibly the best that I have ever had. I am so happy that Homestead has another quality place in main strip - this establishment will definitely help in Homestead's revival.",

The Reuben Balls were a very good appetizer.  Our table also ordered the spinach and artichoke bruschetta which was a bit overly dressed and became soggy.  For our entrees, I had the chicken club which was delicious.  My husband and another ordered the french dip sandwich which had good flavor but the bun was inappropriate and not crusty to hold up with the au jus.

The host was exceptionally friendly as I waited for my party of 6 to arrive. We were seated right away and tended to by a nice server. I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Crab and it was wonderful. The remainder of our crew ordered a combination of the house specialty Triple Chocolate Zucchini Bread French Toast and the Potato Pancake Eggs Benedict. Everything looked incredible and everyone left very happy and satisified. Checks and drink refills took awhile, but we weren't in a huge hurry, so that's forgiven. Also - I recommend opening a window for some fresh air - it smelled a bit of cleaning fluid (again, not a huge deal, but worth mentioning). At an average of $10/entree or less, Dorothy 6 is one of the more reasonable brunch deals in town!",

Long story short, service at our table was off to a really rough start and took over a half hour to  just get an appetizer in. Once the ball was rolling though, our server was very attentive and friendly.  Menu looked awesome and we had a hard time choosing! We settled on pierogies for an app and they were amazing! Shared a plate with 2 cheddar and 2 jalapeno; not greasy, nice and crispy on one side, and not overly doughy. I had the beet and arugula salad with added steak (cooked perfectly and very tender) with a house made orange/mint vinagrette and my friend had the flat iron which was also very flavorful and cooked right.  I'm sure will be back for more pierogies, to try more of the menu, and give the service another shot :)",

You step inside and look up to see a magnificent crystal chandelier.  Our group went for Sunday brunch and were pretty much the only ones there.  The service was so so and it took a long time to get our orders taken, food delivered, and checks handed out.  The bloody marys they have looked tasty and there is also a very nice draft list. The menu prices are very reasonable and they have a nice mixture of sweet and savory options.  I usually stick with the sweet and was not disappointed by their amazing chocolate zucchini bread French toast served with strawberries and whipped cream. It was tremendous and my only complaint is the portion was small and I left still hungry.  Others in my party ordered the eggs benedict which came with two very small pieces and no sides.  I would consider going back to try lunch or dinner.",

They even let you taste the beer before they served you a whole one .. just to make sure you liked it .. The BEST part is that it wasn't PACKED to the WALLS with people and nobody rushed you to leave.  We stepped out on the patio where they had a heated torch lamp to keep you warm .. The seafood POT PIE was amazing and the fish sandwich I was told was excellent too. This is a TRUE BREATH OF FRESH AIR to Homestead and MUCH NEEDED..

Fro $8.00, my husband got 2 eggs, breakfast potatoes, an excellent marble rye toast and sausage.  For $10.00, I got 2 small potato pancakes topped with two slightly overdone poached eggs with a small amount of hollandaise sauce (the included sausage patty I ordered on the side for my husband to eat since I'm a vegetarian. ) While everything tasted good (and I am someone who is turned off by huge portions), my husband had a large platter of food for the price while mine was a quite small breakfast.  Fortunately, my husband shared his rye toast with me so I left feeling pleasantly full.  (Shouldn't potato pancake Benedict come with one piece of toast?) I would probably return if in the area but wouldn't make a special trip.  A bonus was that it's in the same block as Annex Cookery so I was able to pick up a kitchen utensil that I've wanted to try (they also have an adorable selection of kitchen clocks!)",

    "text": "My friends and I ate dinner at Dorothy 6 last night prior to a show. Initially, we were all very impressed by the downstairs atmosphere, great beer selection and decor. We got there around 6pm and had to be at the show down the road at 8pm. There were six of us so we were sat upstairs, which was a bit awkward as we were the only people up there for the first 20 minutes or so. Nevertheless, we were attended to quickly at first and we were not in a hurry given that we had an hour and a half or more for dinner. After our first round of drinks, we ordered food by 6:30pm and that's where it started going wrong. The waitress didn't come back for almost an hour. She left one of the drinks we ordered with the meal on the bar and when she brought it up 45 minutes later, all the ice had melted but she served it anyway and gave no apology for why it took so long. In the meantime, our friends had to go downstairs to order more drinks at the bar. Two other groups were sat upstairs after us and both were served much sooner than us. Our food finally arrived at 7:40pm, again with no apology or even excuse, and we had to scarf it down and then run to the show. I will say that the food was good, though none of us got to enjoy it. I don't think they can handle having tables upstairs and downstairs, so I certainly wouldn't go back with groups of more than 4 and only if you can sit downstairs.",

We started with smokestack martini's - De-Lish! The pierogi's for an appetizer, very good. Everyone enjoyed their entree's, flat iron steak, crab cakes, Reuben sandwich. My husband ordered pierogi's for entree, which were good, but felt they were overpriced, could have had a steak for a few dollars more. I loved the atmosphere and our service was good. Looking forward to going back again, especially when weather warms up, as they have a nice area for dining al fresco!",

Today was sitting at a high top table with no service from anyone, even the hostess (who I think is the owner) walked past multiple times and did not acknowledge us.   Then we snagged two seats at the bar close to the service bar area. The clean cut blond male bartender who was working service bar did not have the curtesy to clear the glasses or check from the previous patron. He looked us right in the eye and continue to pour beer and make drinks w/o acknowledgment. I swear he was a mute. Then the other bartender who's 2nd day was a Saturday night tried to save the night. (Was clearly in the weeds)   However when my fiance ordered a $7 Moscow mule and it was poured with jacquins vodka, come on at least Smirnoff or skyy. The night was over. I chugged my Kentucky bourbon barrel ale and off we were.  Also as we were leaving, we saw the feature for the night. Beer & bacon pierogies for $16. Who the hell is gonna pay $16 for pierogies? They may be the best pierogies in the world, but it's just dough. All the pieces are there to be a great place, please I beg you D6 do things right & have a better menu selection than only things that are apps served as dinner entrees.   Thank you! & please consider  PS the 2nd star is only because off decor and beer selection.",

Yesterday was my first visit and the service and food was nothing short of great. I ordered a Thirsty Dog 12 Dog's of Xmas Ale (very delicious) at only $2. They offer a decent list of specials in addition to roughly 25 beers on draft, a rotating craft bottle selection, and a lengthy wine list.  On the food front: I ordered their in house made peirogies as an appetizer; a sampler of beer bacon, chedder, and japlepeno fillings. The sandwich selection all looked promising and I settled on the reuben as per sever recommendation. The beef is corned in house- a perfect blend of thickness and tenderness, not stringy at all. The house fries were a bit lack luster; the only food item that left me undersatisfied.   The atmosphere is relaxed and modern, with an industrial meets classy feel. The dining space is cozy and the bar seemed very inviting. I also noticed an upstairs, unsure of what it offers. I didn't notice any TV's.  If you're looking for a quick, high quality meal at a fair price close to the Waterfront I would definitely stop here.",

Tonight. . . Not so much. We didn't realize you had to have reservations. Most restaurants don't take them anymore unless it's a very upscale or higher end. We were told with no reservation it would be a 20 minute wait. It was more than half an hour. We were seated and because we had perished the menu we were ready to order. Our waitress took our order, brought us bread, brought us food and we didn't see her again until she spotted us sitting with a table full of empty dishes. Instead of entrees we ordered a few appetizers. I had the meatballs and the wedge salad. I didn't care for the strips of fried red pepper and I had 2 specs of bacon. He cucumber slices were small but nice. The tomatoes brought color to the plate. My other appetizer was meatballs. It was four meatballs and a small cup of marinara. The meatballs were a little over done. The marinara was ok-nothing to write home about.  I'm not taking Dorothy's off of my list of places to go but will definitely make sure it's a weeknight.",

We got there kind of early on a Saturday night (around 5:30-6), so that might be the window for good service as it was busy but not yet packed.  Our server was great (I forgot to catch her name) - attentive but not overly so.  We sat in the outdoor area and it was cool and breezy (the patio lies between 2 buildings which block the sun so it's not roasting out there) and quiet- they were playing some blues/jazz music which was a good volume so that it wasn't overpowering but you still didn't have to hear other people's conversations. Though the metal chairs out there aren't super comfortable, that would be my only complaint.    We had the spinach and artichoke bruschetta which was to die for.  It was a really hearty size, but we could have eaten several more plates of it it was so good.  I had the flat iron steak. I asked for it medium and it came out medium and was perfect.  Hubby had the perogies with jalapeno and was happy.  I had a nice glass of house pinot noir, hubby had a beer on tap.  I feel the prices were reasonable - an appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 drinks came to $50 which is not bad for date night.  I would definitely go again next time we're in Homestead.",

    "text": "I visited last Sun. for dinner after seeing a movie at AMC Loews theater in the Waterfront.  Because I visit the Waterfront now and again to see movies, I keep a list of non-chain restaurants nearby handy, and Dorothy 6 was at the top of it.  I don't know if the bells on the door failed to jingle when I walked in, but oddly, nobody came to greet me and my dining partner. Because it was empty except for maybe one other customer at the bar, we took the liberty of choosing a table.  Before we sat down, a waitress emerged from the kitchen and handed us menus.  Because their website doesn't seem to be functioning, I wasn't able to look up the menu ahead of time, which would have been nice.  As it were, I found the prices a bit higher than I would have liked.  The waitress mentioned the special of the day, crab-stuffed salmon, which sounded amazing, but I balked at the price ($20). Instead, I went with the pierogi entree ($16), and my dining partner went with the reuben sandwich ($10).  When the food came out, after about 10 min., it looked good, but I was a bit surprised by the presentation of the side dish, which was described as caramelized brussels sprouts with bacon.  I was expecting whole brussels sprouts, but this was more of a salad (see photo).  Nevertheless, I found the taste quite pleasant.  As for the pierogis, it was obvious that they were made fresh on site.  The exterior had a satisfying crispness, and the filling had just the right amount of cheddar flavor, and was soft but not mealy.  The caramelized onions served on top of the pierogis added a hint of sweetness, and the sour cream had a pleasant tinge of seasoning.  I was only able to eat half of the pierogis and brussels sprouts, so I took the rest home, and they were just as good the next day.  I didn't taste my dining partner's reuben, so I can't comment on it myself, but he enjoyed it, finishing it and the steak-cut fries that came with it.  In general, I found the quality of food here to be quite good, but I found it to be a bit overpriced.  I don't have any complaints about the service, and the ambiance, as others have mentioned, is quite interesting and beautiful.  I'm not sure if business is normally as slow as it was when I visited.  I hope not, since I'd like to see this place succeed, esp. in a town such as Homestead, which has few shopping and dining options outside of the Waterfront.",

    "text": "First of all, I'm very excited that all these new places are opening in Homestead! I'm so excited to try them all. Recently my husband and I ventured to Dorothy 6 Blast Furnace on a down night. The restaurant only opened in November. We'd read the reviews the restaurant had gotten already and figured it was worth a try.  The interior of the restaurant is really nice. Brick walls with a steel mill theme. There's even a guide to warning whistles behind the bar. There's also a gorgeous chandelier in the entrance. The space has two levels, although they're currently only serving on one. I'm guessing as they begin to get more service they'll expand to the second level.   We got the jalapeno pirogies as an appetizer. They were delicious. I'm not even a HUG pirogie fan. I usually find them to be a little too buttery/greasy...but these were perfect. They still had that comfort food deliciousness but weren't laden with butter.  For dinner I had the meatball sandwich. It was very good. The meatballs are actually stuffed with cheese and spices, and I really enjoyed the marinara they use on the sandwich. All sandwiches come with steak fries. They're on the softer side, which I like but I know a lot of people aren't big fans of. My husband got the steak. He said it was good, but he could tell it had been sitting for awhile.  It did take us a little longer than expected to be served our entrees...almost an hour (reason for 3 stars instead of 4). You can definitely tell they're a new restaurant when it comes to service. Everyone is very nice, but it seems they aren't up par yet as far as checking on tables and getting meals out. However I know these are growing pains that come with opening up a new place.   The food definitely makes this place worth the visit. I'm looking forward to stopping back in the future once they've established themselves a bit more.",
