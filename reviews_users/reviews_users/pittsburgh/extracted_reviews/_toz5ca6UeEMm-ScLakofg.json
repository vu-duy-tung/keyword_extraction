The natural casings deliver that wonderful snap as bite into it. The fries are also hot and fresh. And the beer! Oh, the beer! So many wonderful varieties. I can't even begin to describe what wonders their beer cases hold. Go. Eat. Drink. Enjoy.",

While the hot dogs are of good quality, they honestly have the blandest, odd tasting chili I have ever had.  First off, I don't like beans in hot dog chili.  Second, it didn't really add any flavor.  It just gave it an odd texture.  They are also overpriced.  Their onion rings weren't all that good either.  Lots of microbrews makes one hope for beer battered onion rings.  Nope!  Just crappy almost store bought low quality breaded onion rings.  And change your fry oil once in a while!  So to sum up, beer: good.  Food: sucks.",

We went up the Duquesne, walked up to the Mon to find a spot for lunch, and then down the Mon Incline. But after the walk along the street overlooking the rivers, we were cold and in need of lunch warmth :)  First off, the beer selection is amazing. And Mr. L and I are one to always try new beers, but they had a ton I had never even seen before. Very exciting! and incredibly reasonably priced, even on the specialty beers.  And the dogs were excellent - mom and I both had the German Shepherds (sauerkraut & spicy brown mustard), and Mr. L had the Bulldog (same as ours but on a kielbasa). The hotdog was delicious, but I think if I got it again, I'd go w/ the kielbasa. And we had onion rings which were a hit, although the coating was more of the crumbly coating, and I prefer the puffy coating, but they stayed crispy. And I had the cheese fries (naturally), and I found them to be excellent! Molten fake cheese and yummy fries = how I love them.  Mr. L said if we had one of these near where we live, he'd be there all the time!",

The fried pickles (with tiger sauce), pub fries (with yeungling cheese sauce), and the loaded mac n cheese are all highly recommended.    Service was also very good. We had a party of 13 including 8 kids and did not want for anything.  Beer selection was also superb.  I'd stay away from the sandwiches though. The chicken sandwich and Philly cheesesteak were mediocre at best.  Overall, very happy though. Highly recommend!",

I've heard from others they are pricey, but I guess that is what is expected from a place that sells craft beer.    I was really pleased with their selection.  Most of the bottles I purchased were around $2-3 which is expected when buying speciality beer.  My six pack ended up around $14.  I don't understand the complaints about the price, really.  Next door at Redbeards you can buy $2.50 drafts?  For the same price, I can get better quality and more selection of beer.  Sure, there are beers for $7/bottle, but I'm pleased to find cherry wheat for the same price.  Haven't tried the food, but I did notice it's all dog themed, which is novel, but kind of cute.

With a robust menu of hot dog options and sides like Motz sticks, they offer an simple, easy to please option for everyone. My Chihuahua dog was decent. I really like the bun- It was like a thick Hawaiin Roll. My complainant is with the cheese- it was like Kraft shredded cheddar cheese that wasn't melted yet and kept falling off in little pieces.  As for drinks, I can picked the Sweet Baby Jesus Chocolate Peanut Butter stout (which tasted like a tootsie roll). Had I not drank so much the day before, I would've like to keep going at this place to try all the different varieties. I can see why this place is a local favorite for beer variety.",

Look no further because Packs & Dogs awaits.  It's not a matter of IF you can find something good. Rather, it's deciding on WHAT to get. Multiple shelf lined cookers make that decision rather difficult. That and the fact that this shop also has six or so drafts to choose from at the bar in the back...and hotdogs, of course.  Booths and tables line the one side of the indoor seating area and chairs and couches line the other. Want some fresh air instead? Grab a table at the outdoor seating area.  As for me, I bought a bottle of O'Fallon Cherry Chocolate, plopped down on one of the comfy chairs and watched the last 20 min of Rambo: First Blood, Part II on the corner TV.  Stay in or take out; you can't lose!",

Hot dogs, hamburgers, chicken tenders, fries, onion rings and chicken sandwiches. But they are all fantastic! I have never had a bad experience here. Their food always comes out hot.  Along with great tasting food there are also tons of selections of beer for those 21 and over.  Packs & Dogs is one of my favorite places for a quick bite to eat or just to hang out with friends.",

    "text": "Hot Dogs aren't just some tube full of meat byproducts....well, they are, but not all meat tubes are created equally!  And not every corner shop can hock their wares in the way that Packs and Dogs does.  As a long time lover of sausages, wursts, and such, I've been around the block with the meaty objects of my affections, and I have to say, Packs and Dogs always keeps me coming for more.  The secret to their success is simplicity.  Natural casing dog, an All beef Silverstar dog, a veggie dog, and a kielbasa.  That's the 4 dog options and, really only the All beef and Natural casing get a workout.  Packs keeps with the standard fare when it comes to dog options, with the Chihuahua being the nom de plume for the chili cheese dog.  But what a dog!  Home made chili that is well seasoned, though not spicy, big chunks of white onion, and shredded cheese.  The bun does all it can just to keep the ship from sinking.  And while it often turns into a knife and fork kind of dog, its worth every bite.  The rest of the menu is just as good, which includes a personal favorite, the Irish Setter, your standard slaw dog, as well as a take on the Chicago Dog, and a make your own variety.  And make sure you plan on eating on site, since Packs and Dogs has a beautiful diner style counter, complete with swivelling, circle chairs and booths.  Though, the addition of comfy couches and a mounted 42 inch big screen tv add a bit of a living room atmosphere.  And we can't forget the beer selection!  There is a constantly revolving and improving selection of foreign and domestic craft beers, along with your standard session favorites, all at reasonable prices.  A six pack to go, a draft at the counter, or a bottle in a booth, Packs and Dogs is a nice place for a hot dog dinner.  Now, with all good things, there is some downsides, though none have to do with service, selection, or quality, luckily.  Being that Packs and Dogs is located right on Shiloh in Mt. Washington, sometimes you'll get groups of smoking stragglers hanging out on the pretty tiny outdoor wooden patio, which has a tendency to bottleneck the foot traffic.  And parking is always at a premium on the Mountain, so be sure you're ready to walk from the downstairs parking area, connected to the adjacent lot.  But over all, you won't find a better place for beers and beef links in the Burgh.",

We went there this week and were very disappointed. We went to pick up some dogs right before the pens game but figured we'd get a draft and watch the first period as we waited for food.  We walked in and only one other person was there which was weird. The guy waiting at the register had to ask to be checked out for his 12 pack because the employee was 5 feet away facing the wall looking in his phone.   We ordered our food, sat at the bar, and asked for the employee to put the game on. THEY DID NOT HAVE THE CHANNEL THAT THE PENS WERE ON. We were honestly shocked. Packs n dogs has always been a busy sports bar on game days!  We waited and watched the game on our phone and literally no one came in the entire first period.... apparently we haven't been there for a while and everyone else has already gotten the message that packs and dogs is not the same. We were really sad!  Not to mention we got home and had our food- dogs are the same (delicious) but they changed their shredded cheese to nacho cheese and their chili recipe which didn't taste bad but we were glad we weren't eating it in public because it was so runny and messy. Also the fries here used to be our favorite- thicc and crispy- they were kinda soggy and the side of ranch was half full.   Overall we are really disappointed and will not be back.",

Pennsylvania's archaic alcohol laws make it difficult to find stores with a wide variety of beer without having to buy a case, so coming here was refreshing. The mix and match six pack deal is nice because they take $4.50 off the total of the individually marked bottles. Beers vary a lot in price, but are mostly are in the $3 to $4 range.  I had been to Packs & Dogs before, when I lived in Mt. Washington about five years ago, but hadn't been back until I met a few friends there recently. Since then they've expanded their menu to include more apps and sandwiches.  Ordered a beer, a six pack (which you can't drink there), and a soft pretzel served with Yuengling beer cheese.  I'll save room for a hot dog during my next visit.",

The selection has decreased drastically, the draft beers taste as though the lines haven't been cleaned in months, and everything was very slow despite not being busy.

I'm new to the idea of just grabbing individual beers (oviously I include paying for it), and going, but I'm so into it now. I had my own personal beer tasting party! Individual beers will run you around $2-3 and the fancy schmancy type Framboise's up to $5 .   Some of the ones I choose were Blue Point Toasted Lager, Blue Moon Spring Blonde Wheat Ale and Fort Collins Chocolate Stout. I was super into the Fort Collins and the Blue Point was ok. Blue Moon was a little too....predictable Blue Moon.   I feel like this is an adult candy store. Minus the candy and plus the alcohol content!",

    "text": "Too hungry to make it all the way home the other night, a drained, hungered, athirst Kay and Darren made their way to Mt. Washington for refreshment and comfort on a scalding, congested day.   What we found was the illegitimate son of D's Sixpax and Dogs from Regent Square. Upon entering, our ears were assailed by stridently played-to-death selections from AC/DC and Motley Crue. The music was blaring so much that the gent taking our order at the red-and- silver, diner-style counter could hardly hear my words. I should have brought my earplugs.   Like another reviewer, I too ordered the Golden Retriever, a Steeltown take on a Chi-Town classic complete with all the appropriate accessories (radioactive relish, dill pickles, tomatoes, celery salt, school bus-yellow mustard, and sport peppers). The frank itself was grilled immaculately, its natural casing snapping like bubble wrap with every breach of my incisors, its juicy beef essence permeating each chomp, the accompanying toppings only enhancing and never distracting from the proteins at hand.   And the fries were ochroid spud cudgels par excellence with their coats of outer crispness and plush insides.   The bacon cheeseburger might have been a winner had it been cooked to medium rare instead of well-done. Judging by the dense texture, I suspect it may have been in a freezer a bit too long as well. The bacon was very crisp, however, and the other fixings, including the bakery-quality bun (used for the dog also. did they both come from Grandview Bakery?), were plentiful and fresh.  Packs and Dogs has an odd mancave/greasy spoon/bro-bar vibe about it that I'm not sure works. As I alluded to before, the music was entirely too loud, especially considering that this was an early Thursday evening and that attendance was scant; it was as if a kegger party was being held and hardly anyone showed up. A MMA program could be seen on the flatscreen telly on the wall, but due to the noise (and I love loud, heavy music, just not when I'm trying to eat at a restaurant) we couldn't hear anything uttered by Joe Rogan or the muscled, deformed-of-ear fighters he was interviewing. Leather couches, a jukebox, and a dart board populate the front, which I suppose is intended to create a comfortable ambience, but I cannot imagine that being the case at P&D's on a sultry, intoxicated Saturday night.   While quite obviously a copycat of the East End's version, Mt. Washington's Packs and Dogs misses the bullseye in terms of atmosphere despite making mighty fine hot dogs and french fries. You can relax at D's. Here? Not so much, I reckon. At P&D's busiest, you may have luck getting into a fight, finding a liason, drinking yourself into the gutter, or simply garnering attention to your tanned, scarcely-garbed self.    P.S. Packs and Dogs would be an effortless 4 stars if it was just a hot dog stand and nothing more.",

    "text": "With a great beer selection that's reasonably-priced, chill vibe, and their simple, but pleasing meat-in-casings menu, there's simply little to complain about!  It's definitely no D's, but that's actually a good thing in this instance! You get to ditch the busy crowds and long waits. I mean, seriously...a long wait to eat a hot dog? I'm not sure if that's justifiable. Ever.  They have a ton of beers in their coolers and quite a few on draft. Seriously, if you go to Packs & Dogs and can't find something worth drinking, your level of beer snobbishness must be on a level even hipsters can't latch onto, and I'd hate to be your taste buds.  The Smith's natural casing dogs are excellent, and while their menu seems limited at first glance, you can always conjure up any custom dog you'd like with their solid list of toppings.  The service is friendly and fast, and the food is exactly what you'll want to down with your cold brew(s)! I'll plan on going back...a lot!",

    "text": "Packs & Dogs has quickly become my favorite neighborhood spot. Maybe because there isn't much else around in Mt. Washington or the fact that I just love the idea. Either way...  I have to first say that I am no beer kings. I drink beer, yes, however I'm not one to answer your question on IPA's and stouts. What's nice about Packs & Dogs is there is such an enormous selection of beers to choose from. I do get nervous though because I feel like it would be quite easy to pick something up that I don't like. They have a variety of different 6 pack prices depending on which beers you choose. You can also get 12 packs to go which is great for game day. They have a decent draft selection and in talking to the owner/manager the last time I was there (today) he puts out I guess what you'd call, \"sale\" beer to get people to try beers that normally you would never consider buying before. He doesn't do it because the beer doesn't taste well, he really wants people to expand their palette.  Now my favorite things: the food. I love their hot dogs. I'll let you drink while I eat one or two all beef hot dogs. I have yet to venture off of their $6.00 meal which includes one hot dog, fries (which are amazing) and a small drink. With a wide variety of complimentary topics, why not? They also feature many different varieties of hot dogs with a variety of toppings. One day I'll even try a hamburger, but I'm too addicted to the hot dog.  Thank GOD Pennsylvania doesn't have food laws like they have alcohol laws or I'd be in trouble.",

    "text": "Visited here twice this year with friends, & I'm not sure what happened...possibly new management? The first visit we had to ask for menus twice. As we were enjoying our German Shepherds (so delicious) & shared jalapeno poppers, the server brought over a basket of chicken tenders & said something that we interpreted as, \"on the house.\" So we were confused but excited, but it was way too much food. The server came over later & asked if we ordered the chicken tenders, he mistakenly gave us someone else's order. By that time we had already tried them...so we were charged for them. Needed a doggy bag, had to ask for it twice...I could understand if they were busy, but we were the only ones there. But, yesterday's service was legit awful...we were the only ones there, very exhausted & hadn't eaten all day. Had to ask for menus twice, & we gave it a good 25 minutes, since we were enjoying 2 sample flights. I was the 2nd out of my group of 3 to order & the server behind the bar started walking away after my cheeseburger order...my friend called him back & said he would like to order food too. Our chili cheese fries came with 2 of our orders. By that time a few more people rolled in. Luckily my friend had the chili cheese fries to munch on, because we scarfed down our burger & dog. There were 2 servers behind the bar & when one came out, walking towards the door, my friend got his attention & asked if he could have a cheeseburger. The server admitted he forgot about the order & rushed it. The cheeseburger finally came & my friend scarfed it down & we tallied up & left.   Selection-smection. If the customer service isn't your priority, then you're in the wrong business. There are far too many options in Pittsburgh, even on the Mount, for craft beer & bar food. If there's a next time, it'll be a dog & a 6'er to go.",

Very few beers in the cooler and none of the drafts are priced.

This place is one of my favorite new discoveries about Mount Washington. Packs & Dogs sells regular 6 packs, but also allows you to create your own 6 pack, which is really one of the highlights of going here. Not only do they have a great variety of beers (including seasonal favorites), but they also have a decent amount of ciders, which I am a personal fan of! During holidays, I have been pleasantly surprised by the amount of seasonal beers that are available (i.e. Halloween, Christmas).  I love that Pack and Dogs encourages you to try new stuff that you may not have had an opportunity to try before, without worrying about not liking a whole case. Some beers are around $2, whereas others are upwards of $5.   This place also has sandwiches, hot dogs, and fries that are all pretty decent. If you place an order for delivery, there is a $10 minimum food charge so you might as well go all out! I recommend a sandwich and definitely the chili cheese fries!",

    "text": "I love a good hot dog.  Nothing better than an all-American food that is quite convenient to eat, who doesn't like 'no plate required' food?  What makes a hot dog really good are the toppings you can use.  Packs & Dogs matches the two so perfectly that they create return customers without even trying.  The menu is pretty simple.  Honestly, it's one of the smallest menus I have come across in the Pittsburgh region.  The thing you have to remember is that this is a place that provides hot dogs, it's in their name, so think about that.  Now just because I said it like that doesn't mean they only carry hot dogs, they actually have sides like onion rings, fries and chicken tenders.  They also offer burgers, but seriously stick to the hot dogs here.  One of the things I love about this place is that they refer to their dogs with actual names of dog breeds.  I decided on the Chihuahua which is nothing more than a chili cheese dog with onions.  When I got my order I was floored almost.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that although I ordered only one hot dog, it was more than enough for a single meal.  The way they piled the toppings on here actually kind of made it an all in one meal.  The hot dog itself is delicious.  When I bit into the hot dog it had that snap you want when you go to a hot dog shop.  The casing makes for a good hot dog here.  The chili was rather good too, not overpowering at all and taste combination with the dog itself was amazing.  The onions added a bit of sweetness which offset the spice of the chili.  But what was trying to steal the spotlight from the hot dog was the mound of shredded cheddar cheese on top of it all.    I know I referred earlier to hot dogs as being a 'no plate required' food, but I was so happy I had that basket to catch any and every thing that fell off this monster of a hot dog.  I didn't leave anything in that basket after I destroyed the hot dog, I did not care how I looked when I was devouring that dog.  I used my hands to pick up every last stray that fell off and shoved it in my mouth.  It was carnal and satisfying.  So satisfying that I had no appetite for the event I attended afterwards, but totally worth it.  The packs part of this is pretty solid as well.  There is a humongous amount to choose from when you are looking for you alcoholic sidekick for the hot dog.  A suggestion to you is to pick out your beer first before you order.  This could turn out to be a longer task than you imagined.  I had a nice Russian stout that I had never heard of before my visit here.    Customer service is top notch here.  They definitely pay attention to you and make you feel welcomed here.  I noticed that they have regulars and I have seen the proof as to why.",

    "text": "I live up on Mount Washington and love coming here for a quick six pack or bomber. Walked in today to grab a six pack, got what I wanted (which were some of the better stuff they had I'll admit) and went to the counter and WITH the mix and match discount it was $30+. I was told the new manager raised prices. As a customer review, I just want to let you know that they are a bit too high. Compared to other bottle shops around the area.   Grapefruit Sculpin 5.50? I can get a pint of it for $4-$4.50 somewhere else let alone a bottle of it. Unfortunately unless I hear they lowered their prices again, I will be driving a bit further to other bottle shops instead of going to packs and dogs.   I was told I wasn't the only one who mentioned they probably won't be back. I want to come back, please re-think the prices",
