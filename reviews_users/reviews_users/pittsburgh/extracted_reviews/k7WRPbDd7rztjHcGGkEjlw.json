I've been here several times recently, and plan to keep going! The service is friendly and efficient and the food is good.  I wouldn't say its the best Italian food I've ever had, but it is definitely well above the average around here.  The pasta sauce is like nothing I've had before, but I really like it.  The decor is a little outdated, but I don't mind as long as they keep up the food and atmosphere!",

    "text": "I would like to give a rating for 3 catagories: Food, Service, Atmosphere.  The Food: 3 of 5 stars While expensive, it doesn't look like much on the plate when first served. I ordered the Lasagne Dinner with a choice of soup or salad. I chose soup, and it arrived as a tiny cup of wedding soup that was very salty to taste, much like chicken broth. The lasagne came on a plate and was gigantic, it made me happy. The lasagne had a nice mild overall flavor, slightly bland. Could taste the meat and cheese and the sauce that was poured over it, was hoping for more italian flavors. I was hoping to taste a bit more. It was a nice size, perfectly cooked lasagne. Would have been nice if there was something more given for presentation. Parsley, or something nice for garnishment. The Service: 4-1/2 of 5 stars. While it was not slow, our waitress did take a bit at first for refilling drinks or asking any questions, but was not impersonal or too personal. She was able to catch up to watching drinks and bringing what was needed when she could. I couldn't have asked for better. The Atmosphere: 2 of 5 stars. Upon entering, your ushered to your seat to what looks like dim lighting and a normal entrance. However when you see the flipside of where you came it looks like a double door closet. The doorway that your ushered from has a camera, granted for security purposes, that protrudes into your head/shoulder path. The top corners of the dining areas have black speakers against white walls with loose cords strung.  The bar area is not far from the dining areas but also isn't your typical loud and obnoxious bar, which was a relief. The booth we sat in has seen some many years of usage and in small need of vynal repairs. The table top had crayon marks from the previous children seated before us.  Overall review:  Food was average, but only just so. Happy with service, but would not want to pay New York prices for average experience.",

It may seem a little beat up but that is just the soul that comes out in the food. It is great the soup, the pizza, the pasta. Anything you pick will be good. The menu is not huge and it is a little eclectic but what they do they do really well here. My family stumbled across it one night and it has become a staple. The portions are large and if you go you should know that there will be leftovers in the morning. Staff is really nice and the food is really good.",

    "text": "I am so sad to say anything bad about this place.  This is the kind of place I usually love to find.  You know they are not going to be cutting edge, but they usually know well how to keep a customer happy.   We visited on Valentines day, having decided to dine out at the last minute, we decided to try to find a good local place.  My wife and I had been to Tillies years ago and decided to see if a table might be available without much of a wait.  We arrived at 8:00 and were seated immediately.  I really didn't think much of it, but perhaps I should have.  Our server was great. Very friendly, helpful, and efficient.  We all ordered the homemade spaghetti because the menu seemed to feature it.  My wife had the marinara with a meatball, my son, the aglio olio, and I had ordered the meat sauce, which had a very enticing description.  I forget what it said, but it reminded me of Mom.  We also ordered soup, salad, and wine. The waitress brought some bread that, I must admit was very good and very fresh.  Things started to turn with the wine, or should I say that the wine started to turn?  I could not decide for sure what was wrong with it. It tasted a bit like some very poorly made homemade wine I had, but finally decided that it was just on it's way to becoming vinegar from a really cheap bottle of wine.  One sip was all we drank. The salads were OK, the soup was good. We got our pasta, and we're all disappointed.  Mine came with the wrong sauce (marinara with a meatball) and I immediately sent it back. Yeah, I know that is not too much different, but it was a far cry from what was written on the menu.  My son said his tasted funny, and this quickly growing boy who is eating us out of house and home ate about 1/3 of his.   My wife had the marinara, and it tasted burnt. The waitress returned with my dish REALLY fast.  No I am know culinary expert, but I am smart enough to see that she came back with the same plate with the meatball cut in about four pieces, then covered with another ladle of the marinara.  One half inch of bad sauce is not enough to make me forget that I still did not get what I ordered.  In any case, I tasted the pasta, and dug around looking for signs of this heavenly meat sauce, but had now more than two bites.  After waiting for quite a while, I started to wonder if this waitress was as well trained as I thought.  When she finally came back, she said nothing as she took away our full glasses and my full plate.  I then realized that she probably was well trained to ignore potential problem customers.  I know I should have said something but who wants to sound miserable when taking their family out for Valentines Day? As I was leaving, I wondered how this place stayed in business for fifty years.  It occurred to me later that this may exactly be how they stayed in business.  Sell cheap stuff to regular customers and don't try to please everyone.  Even if they don't come back, they are still dumb enough to pay the bill.  I regret that I was.",

    "text": "My family and I ate at Tillie's for lunch a coupe weeks ago after attending a funeral.  We noticed that everything we order was made with very fresh ingredients and thought that maybe things had turned around.  We all enjoyed our meal.  Tonight, my husband and I went there for dinner and were extremely pleased with our food.  Our server was someone who waited on us 20 years ago when our daughter was a little girl.  She remembered us and we talked briefly.  Our food was terrific.  It was the homemade sauce, pasta, etc. that I remembered.  I had the chicken parm with a side of homemade pasta.  I remembered to ask for my sauce on the side because they tend to drown everything.  The chicken is a full chicken breast cut in half, breaded, fried, served with mushrooms (they ask if you want them), and parmesan cheese.  Cooked perfectly.  And I have always loved their homemade spaghetti.  My husband had something new on the menu - a trio of chicken parm, lasagna, and fettucini alfredo.  He enjoyed it all,.  I had minestrone - it was good, but I [refer it without meat.  He had wedding soup and aid it was very good.  We also had an order of breaded cauliflower.  Just like 20 years ago, only a bigger portion.  The best we've had anywhere.  Almost all the tables were filled with couples and families - large groups.  Everyone was upbeat and happy. It's always a good idea to give a place that might disappoint you a second chance.  My last review was not favorable, but this one is.  I love Tillie's and we will go back.",

I find that it has consistently offered one of the best dining experiences in the Pittsburgh area or anywhere else! It was a Christy Park institution when I was growing up, and it remains so today.  The food, from pizza to more high-end traditional (and authentic!) Italian fare, is of high quality and typically in ample portions. A wide range of selections are available from a variety of styles, each with its own merit. Service is typically very good, even when the facility is full and quite busy.  The location is neat and clean and comfortable, quite appropriate for the nature of the business. The adjoining lot offers ample secure parking.  For a restaurant to attain and maintain such a consistent, high quality level of service for so many years is impressive!  I look forward to future dining opportunities at Tillie's!",

The salads are also excellent; the red wine vinaigrette is very good. Let's put it this way; if I ever become president, I'm having my inauguration party here.

The staff is very friendly and patient. The food is amazing. Lots of options for pasta and other Italian food. The price usually is very reasonable and not too expensive. The only thing I can think of is the location. The area is McKeesport, so it isn't the safest place in the world. But, really, it's a very nice place for a very nice meal.",

Two of us had the *BARRAMUNDI*, marked as a chef specialty and it certainly was special - Creamy tomato basil risotto, topped with sauted spinach topped with the lightly cajun spiced fish with three nice sized cajun shrimp on the side.  Our gnocchi girl did not disappoint and she reports that the gnocchi was pretty yummy.  Hubs had the spaghetti with meatball and sausage and was very happy as well.  Salads were fresh and crisp, bread was plentiful and soft.  We had one minestrone with sausage soup and it also was declared very good.  Their iced tea was different, not brown, but black and naturally pretty sweet.  I liked the variation very much.  Not sure why the lapse, but not going to Tillie's is a definite lapse in choosing your Italian dinner destination!",

The service was a real bummer too. Our waitress was rather unwelcoming and not very helpful.

    "text": "Excellent pasta, pizza, and well everything.  The preparation can be hit or miss at times but the ingredients have made up for this on every occasion in my opinion.  This place has been around for as long as I can remember and it has always been excellent.    The restaurant has a 50's or 60's mob like feel, this is likely due to that it has been the same for countless years.  I always feel like Goodfellas or some other mob classic could have been filmed here.  On a week night, you may be the only one in the place which is sad for the restaurant.  I personally find this to be a plus as I feel as though I am in on a secret no one knows about.  Service is slow but not in a bad way.  I think this is an Italian thing not to be rushed into eating quickly.  Dinner salads are absolutely huge and can be shared with a date adding romantic touch to the meal should that be your goal.  Pastas are homemade and the lasagna is the best in Pittsburgh Area.  Pizza is different than anything else I have ever had but absolutely excellent.  Warning: you will crave this stuff after eating it.      At any rate, I highly recommend this place if you want quality Italian food at a great price.  Tillie's don't change a thing, I'm sure Matilda (the founder) would be proud.",

    "text": "Seven of my 'hangry' family members came here for my grandmother's birthday. We stopped in around 1:30 and the first thing we noticed was the table was still dirty; I was willing to overlook this, as our waiter was pretty decent.   Our drinks came out without err and we had a great time on the second level just talking and laughing. I ordered a dirty martini and our waiter brought me extra drink, which was mixed, but wouldn't fit in my glass at the time, which was awesome.   We placed our orders and since it was now approaching 2pm, we were still on the lunch menu. The food took forever to come out- when I finally looked at the time, I realized it was now close to 3pm.   Upon arrival, I noticed my fettuccine was about 2 bites of pasta; I wanted so much more. It tasted homemade and I wondered if it was. I noticed the garlic in my dish was minced and from a jar. The 25% Italian in me was really disappointed and hoping for fresh-cut. To me, this just ruined the dish. You take fresh pasta that tastes almost like it's homemade and then you throw some jarred garlic on it- blech!  The rest of the family got dishes of similar size and I was displeased to see the amount of shrimp on a plate for an adult (maybe 6?). It looked like a child's portion.  However, I will note the calamari appetizer was to die for and extremely abundant. It came with a sort of ginger sauce that had a sweet tang and had me coming back for more.   Be aware, the parking lot that you would think is for Tillie's, isn't for the restaurant, and I was told by a local that you will be towed for parking there. It wasn't hard to find street parking on a Saturday afternoon, though.   If I'm in the area, I might stop again to experience dinner, but wouldn't go out of my way to come back.",

She was a wonderful old women that was always nice to me. Her picture hangs in the dining room, a beautiful tribute.  As a family, we have used the side room many times for family dinners or occasions. The room is nice for small to large families. Call for reservations for large groups. Service has always been friendly. We have had to wait for large orders, but on the whole it comes out in a timely fashion.  I highly recommend the Homemade Spaghetti with plan or meat sauce, it's personal preference.  I love the Homemade Gnocchi with meat sauce and a meatball. It is also good with a piece of hot sausage. I like the cup of Wedding soup as a side dish. The cup is a small taste, just enough to complement the bread that comes with each meal as well.  I used to like the salad, but it has change in time and not as good as it used to be.  Drinks from the bar have always been a bit pricey for my taste, again personal preference as to what you're willing to pay.  I do not recommend take out. We have tried to take out several times. It is best to dine in. The take out menu is the same price as a regular dinner served in the restaurant, except they do not give you any side dish, no soup or salad. I never thought that was a good deal. We don't take out. We do carry out left over's.  Despite my negative comments, it is a nice family Italian Restaurant that you should consider for dinner.  Parking has never been a problem for the time we dine. Parking on the street or in the lot beside the restaurant. I did read that the lot is not owned by the restaurant. I am not sure, but everyone parks there.",

We didn't send it back, because, for some reason, we feared that they would just give a microwave boost.  The 3 available red wines went well with the Italian food, although they were sweeter and heavier than a typical Napa or Italian wine.  Tillie's deserves credit for managing our disparate group and getting our food out at almost the same time.  I've never been to Tillie's before, but would go back if I were nearby.",

After reading all of the reviews, it seemed like you needed to have grown up in the area to really appreciate Tillie's, but we decided to give it a shot anyway.  It wasn't super busy, but the beer selection was great and our dinner was too. I got a great pasta dish was spicy sausage and MAN it was spicy.   Overall, Tillie's was great, but it's pretty average in terms of Italian dinner. If you're looking for some really good Italian food, I'd recommend checking out Pasta Too in Bethel Park.",

    "text": "Until recently, Tillie's was one of those nagging loose ends for me on Yelp. I'd been there a number of years ago, long before I'd created an account and took Pittsburgh by storm (heh). Since that amicable visit, I'd been itching to return.   A quaint canopy, a bird bath,and potted plants decorate the exterior. Upon pulling  into the gravel-coated parking lot with my mother, I felt as if we were visiting an older relative who still lived in a declining community, defiantly refusing to move, meticulously keeping up appearances.   Upon entering, our attention was immediately trained on a portrait of the restaurant's matriarch, Matilda \"Tillie\" Smith, who founded the establishment in 1962, her spirit remaining very much intact, reassuringly watching over the place while her son and daughter-in-law continue to keep tradition alive and running.   As my own mom and I lunched together on a Saturday afternoon spent dropping in on my sister who lives nearby, a child's birthday party, complete with an army of guests, happily went on. For an eatery in a neighborhood many people avoid, good cheer was abundant, few booths, tables, and chairs were unoccupied. Balloons floated clumsily to the ceiling like drunks wearing Legion Flight Rings, adolescent girls whispered and giggled, wrapping paper was torn, burly men carrying packages with bows on them entered and bear-hugged other burly men carrying toddlers, all while Frank Sinatra's vocals permeated the room. Tillie's was alive. She is alive.   Hell, I feel her pinchin' my earlobe as I write this. Okay, Matilda, the food, the food, I'm gettin' to it...  Not being able to remember what I devoured here 7 years ago, my sister recommended the incredibly edible Prime Rib Pizza. A Boursin and Mascarpone spread coats the bottom of the pita-like crust, which is then liberally coated with chopped prime rib, caramelized onions, roasted red peppers, provolone, blue cheese, and fried arugula.   I could have folded each cut of this shareable pie and convinced myself I was eating some sort of exotic sandwich. The clash between the smooth, sweet cream of the Mascarpone/Boursin blend, the sharpness of the Provolone, and the strength of the blue cheese was alone a gastronomic symphony. The prime rib provided savory heft and depth, while the red capsicum and onions amplified the sweetness, the arugula kicking the entire pizza further into the stratosphere with its peppery essence. Each bite was an amusement park ride, a funhouse jaunt, a carnival, a cavalcade of flavors and textures.   Before hand, the Lobster and Crab Grilled Cheese served as an entertaining opening act. Within triangles of brunch-worthy toast, lump crab meat and chopped lobster claw crawled out of a magnificent Alouette/Gruyere mire, the former's brie-ish lard melding with the latter's nutty, earthy, somewhat briny profile, both serving the rendered seafood well like a congealed chowder or dip of sorts  Garnished with arugula (Mama Smith must have loved it), a serving of Tomato Basil Bisque was an expected and welcome companion to the sandwich, its inherent zest and cream compelling dunk after dunk after dunk until only the soup remained. This upscale, gourmet take on a lunchroom classic delivered comfort, bliss,and culinary smack with every bite and sip.   Dessert was a pair of cannily crafted cannoli. Amply filled with a sugary, whipped Ricotta that was riddled with chocolate chips and pistachio shards, the twin cookie ducts were dressed with chocolate syrup and powdered sugar. Vaguely similar to ice cream waffle cones, careful chomps unveiled chilly, milky, saccharine lusciousness, contrasting textures playing a crucial part yet again. I kept fearing that a mess of confection would run down my fingers, the cannoli tricking me into thinking I was standing in front of Page's Dairy Mart on a 90 degree day.   McKeesport may be a town that last saw its banner days 2 scores ago, but if you've ever dined at Tillie's, you'd never be aware of the local steel industry's departure and the dreams and quality of life that collapsed with it. Tillie's doesn't just hang on, she sits on her porch in a recliner, prospering like a daffodil sprouting from a crack in the pavement.   So, let me pose some questions to the audience: Are you frustrated? Are you pining for an old-school, casual dining experience in which flash, pretentiousness, and trendiness are uninvited?   Eat at Tillie's, silly.  P.S. The service was world-class.",

The restaurant is named after the old woman who used to run the joint...her picture still hangs in the front room as a reminder of days gone by.  I was told back then you could get a huge plate of pasta, and the food was amazing!!! I don't know if grandma took the recipes with her when she passed on, but both my fiance and I were not impressed with the quality of their food. We ordered the homemade spaghetti. Sounds simple enough, but what we got looked and tasted worse than a can of Chef Boyardee. The sauce was bland, and the noodles weren't right. I always joke about how bad of a cook I am, but I swear I could make better than this.  I loved our waitress Tia. She was awesome. Very friendly and attentive. I just wish the food was better than it was.  I think they need to reexamine what recipes to use for a restaurant that was known for their fine cuisine. And keep Tillie's memory alive by serving nothing but the best.",

Timing was acceptable,  no rush.  Impressively,  the calamari was not greasy or over cooked to leather.  A nice compliment of red sauce and a smattering of cheese baked on top; not drowned in sauce and cheese,  thankfully. The spaghetti was nice and dry,  not dripping with water pooling pink sauce in the bottom of the bowl.  Sauce was very nice,  not too sweet or too overwhelming and clinged nicely to the noodles.  Soup was light and well supplied with crab.  All in all,  a surprising and enjoyable lunch.  If up this way again,  I'll definitely be stopping in to try some other menu items.  Price is very reasonable,  service was friendly and efficient. Try it! Bill was $13.35 + tip.",

    "text": "My family and I have been coming here now for the past few months about once a week, and we really enjoy coming here.    One of the most positive things I can say is that the service has been spectacular every time we have come.  The food, for the most part, has been great, too.  We've had some issues, but they were handled swiftly, and without any problems.  I can't hold that against them, though, because everyone has a bad day every once in a while.  Who can complain about a place that normally does a great job any other time?  Plus, as I stated, they handled it.   So now, the fun part:  recommendations.  I will start by saying that when it comes to sauce, I am a meat sauce fan.  I have NEVER been a fan of marinara, or plain red sauce.  Tillie's is one of the only places where I have no problem ordering the plain sauce--it's that good.  I was a bit leery when I read that they were known for it, before we started coming here.  Well--this time, the word on the street really was True!  It's awesome!  Pair the red sauce with their homemade noodles, and its a win-win!  Big, big, big, big fan of their \"Milanese\".  The Chicken one is so good...that I can't even find words to describe it.  I crave it, to say the least. They bread the protein in a parmigiano cheese and paprika coating, and cover it half and half with their ridiculously good red sauce, and a garlic butter sauce that is so good I have been found to be scooping it off of the plate and eating it when nobody is looking.  Ugh.. just writing the review is making me hungry.  We've also found their soups to be great.  While their wedding is good, as is their pasta fagiole, I found the one they do with spicy sausage to be AMAZING.  They've only had it once since i've been there, and I pray each time we walk in that they have it again.  It's another thing that I crave all the time...  While I find them to be extremely pricey, we all really like their ravioli, too.  They are big, but I don't think 2 of them cut it for dinner.  I'm always left hungry still, and wanting more.  I've also found the Marsala to be very good.  It's not the \"best\" i've ever had, but its really good!      We found the fried cheese to be \"okay\".  I was not really impressed with the \"Parm\".  It may have just been a bad day for it (as this was the visit we had issues with).  I found the breading to be entirely too thick and just not tasty.  It was dry, and hard as a rock.  Again, though, this was our \"bad visit\", that they made right with us.  I will have to be adventurous in the future, and order it again, just to see if it was just a bad day.  I've read others say the Parm is good, so I will take the risk and will update accordingly, when I can break myself away from ordering the Milanese each time I go...    I also am not a fan of their Tiramisu.  I found this to be very dry, and just not what I am accustomed to.  It was almost like what is normally the delicious mascarpone, was really thick, and tasted like cream cheese.  It was on the level of I probably would not order again.  I just didn't like it...  Overall, though, there are so many things here that are so amazing.  We continue to go back, and I look forward to eating our way around their sizable menu!",

    "text": "My friends and I drove from Dallas to ride The Great Allegheny Passage and on our first visit to Tillie's we arrived 30 minutes before they closed to be told that the fryer and oven were both turned off. The waitress couldn't offer a menu or make a suggestion on something to eat. We were hungry and not familiar with the town, and this place was already our second choice (Woody's is permanently closed) so one of the locals recommended spaghetti.  My friend asked if we could get some bread while we wait and I saw the waitress pull a wad of bread out of the bag and put it in a basket and bring it to us. No toasting (not surprised, the oven was off supposedly), no buttering, no seasoning (garlic, salt, parsley, etc) ... Just plain bread out of a bag. There were packets of butter found under the mound of bread. Even olive garden cooks, salts, and butters their frozen bread sticks.   The food was bland. I like my pasta al dente and this was undercooked. The sauce had no seasoning, no garlic, no basil, no red pepper, no roasted tomatoes, no olives, etc... My friend guessed it was canned or jarred. The ground beef hadn't been seasoned nor browned. $14/serving for that is the only thing that left a taste in my mouth. I would have given them 1 star based on my first visit.   On the second visit (someone else drove), it became obvious that very little is actually made there and about the same effort goes into what is made there. The service was a little better (hostess was clueless but waitress was knowledgeable and attentive). We got the same bland bagged bread with nothing on it and cold butter packets under the bread. My friend's pizza crust was obviously frozen (no flavor), covered in the same tasteless tomato sauce and I'm certain it was pre-formed/stretched (pan shape) before being frozen so you can be assured they buy it like that. My other friend got the chicken milanese and ate almost the entire thing. I think he liked his, and it did look good... But more of that bland sauce.  I got the hot sandwich, knife and fork roast beef. The meat was a little dry and had no seasoning on it... But finally, they toasted the bread... I don't guess a lot of people order that and the bread was stale from the bag the kitchen uses for it. You couldn't cut through it with the knife, otherwise the meat was tender and plentiful. I only needed the knife for the bread which I skipped after the first bite. It was covered in brown gravy with no seasoning.  Definitely never eating here again.",

    "text": "Old school, in all the right ways.... it has been quite some time since I was young and came to Tillie's with my family. Despite it being right off the main drag in McKeesport, it's not often I find myself driving through town so I guess this has been a case of out of sight, out of mind.   I was, however, recently going through McKeesport to a funeral home and since my boyfriend is not originally from around here I decided we should stop in for dinner to see if it was as good as I remembered...and now I'm wishing I had reminded myself how good this place truly is a lot sooner.   If you're looking for high scale ambiance, this isn't the place for you. Tucked away along a brick street with a gravel parking lot in the back, what this place lacks in curb appeal and high class decor it TOTALLY makes up for in service and food quality.   The dining area is still old school, but clean and adequate in size with old world, cozy comfort. The waitress greeted us with a basket of Mancinni's bread and butter and promptly got our drinks while we looked over the extensive menu.  This is what authentic Italian looks like... homemade pastas, gnocchi, ravioli etc and multiple homemade sauces to choose from. Chicken, veal, fish... all can be served different ways from Parmigiana to picatta to Marsala, Milanese and more. They have this awesome \"trio\" where you choose 3 with options including chicken parm, lasagna, gnocchi, ravioli etc. They also have a sandwich and pizza menu separate from their dinners, but more on that later.  My boyfriend chose the Trio with chicken parm, meat ravioli, and lasagna and I got the chicken parm with a pasta upgrade for gnocchi for a few bucks (well worth it) more. They have the best gnocchi I've ever eaten-dense, but light and pillowy at the same time. All dinners come with either soup or salad. My boyfriend says he had the best Cesar salad he's ever had there. My dinner salad was great too with onions, tomato, cucumber, olives and a peperoncini.   The portion size is extremely large so come hungry. My chicken parm came with two large pieces I couldn't even finish the first. The Parmesan also comes with mushrooms if you like or they will keep off if you don't. This is the first time I've had chicken parm made with fresh mushrooms and it was amazing. Their homemade tomato sauce is absolutely the same as years ago and is to die for... they definitely don't skimp on the sauce either. To be honest, I would be happy with the bread basket and a bowl full of sauce.  The prices can seem a little high until you see how much food you actually get and that it is absolutely the best quality... this place makes you realize going some place like Olive Garden or Bravo, which may be a few bucks cheaper, is a complete waste of money. For the two of us, full dinners we managed to get out the door under $50 with enough leftovers for another meal for each of us!   The service was fantastic... always full drinks and friendly. We couldn't wait to come back to try the pizza, which was actually around since 1947 (before Tillie's even opened). We literally came back a week later to try the pizza... and the second trip just reinforced the first... this is an awesome, off the grid place.   We got a large pizza with hot sausage crumbles, pepperoni and mushrooms. The crust was soo good.., homemade and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. And the service, once again, top notch. I think we may have just found our new go-to Italian restaurant!",

I got the chicken Milanese which was moist and excellent.   The wedding soup was just ok. I would suggest Caesar salad because the dressing was out of this world. ( I picked at my husbands)   Their sauce is very good and a little sweet.",

    "text": "My family has been coming here for as long as I can remember. It's tucked away in a neighborhood setting in McKeesport. Because of that, parking can be interesting... and the inside of the restaurant is quite dated, but who cares it is worth it!  This is some of the best Italian comfort food in Pittsburgh. Their homemade tomato sauce is out of this world - the meat sauce is even better.  I usually get the homemade pasta w/ meat sauce, but since becoming vegetarian, I opted for the plain tomato sauce this time. It is NOT plain/boring whatsoever, and it truly does not disappoint.   The entrees come with a nice side salad and also thick sliced Italian bread in a basket. Both are delicious and fresh- though the bread is not made in-house, but rather top quality Mancinis bread.  My boyfriend got the pizza with meat sauce instead of plain sauce (DELICIOUS!) with pepperoni on top. It is a thicker crust, which gives it a very homemade feel to it. He absolutely loved it and had half of it for lunch the next day.  We also got one order of tiramisu to go- it was delicious and a good sized slice for the money.   Service was great on our most recent visit. We were very pleased!  Tillie's is truly a hidden gem of Pittsburgh. If you haven't been, you need to go. It is not fancy, frilly Italian food- it is old-world, stick to your ribs Italian-American comfort food with incredible flavor! Check it out!",

My mother ordered the Parmesan crusted chicken, it looked amazing and tasted even better.  Again, the service was great and food wasn't bad - it just lacked flavor.

My youngest daughter and I ordered the lunch portion of Homemade Spaghetti with tomato sauce and meatballs, and my sister ordered the Chicken Filet - Parmigiana style. My eldest ordered the fettuccini alfredo.    My favorite food we had that day was the salad - the house dressing is delish. I also loved the homemade tomato sauce and meatball. The homemade pasta was a bit overcooked, so next time I will try regular pasta - but even so - I really loved it. The Chicken Filet and Fettuccini also got high marks from our table.  Tillies really puts you in the mind of someplace you might have eaten in the 50s or 60s - and I mean that in a good way. It was the decor with the music and just that good homemade italian food vibe. I can't wait to go back.",

Everything was cocked to perfection and the food came out piping hot. It was very tasty. 4 stars because I was a little turned off but the salad. The dressing was good, but unfortunately the lettuce had old wilted bits all through it. I will be back but I will probably try the soup next time instead of the salad. They have a great menu, organized very well. I definitely want to try more of their dishes but I loved the eggplant so much I might have to get it again next time.",

We wound up getting sat immediately for dinner at 5. Our server came over shortly. It took a little while to get our drinks, and Matt's first drink was missing an important ingredient, the rum. I digress.   The bread came and we inhaled it. It was good. Then the salads showed up, and mine had an extra special ingredient, a long, black hair. Nope. No thanks. Back it went. A second loaf of bread came out, topped with a fly. A dead one at that. I was flabbergasted. This review originally would have been a five star; just as it was before. But tonight something was bad. Our server was a little slow.   Fortunately the manager tried to save the day and give us dessert. The only thing that made that $88 dinner worth it...if I can even say that.   I will not be back.",

    "text": "Something is wrong and no one cares.   Dressed in a suit and tie (very overdressed for Tillies) I was basically ignored.   First the salad which sent back. First, how many people send a salad back? I was not asked why nor offered something like a soup in its place. The 2 layers of greens filled basically 1/3 to 1/4 of the usual salad. There were croutons just thrown all over the top, probably 3 times the usual amount. The waiter just took it and said nothing.  The scampi arrived with a lukewarm dish. That means it had to have been sitting for a long while.....the dish was touchable with your hands. Secondly the scallops were drenched in 1/2 inch of some liquid with a smattering of butter floating on whatever the liquid was. It need two doses of salt to have much of any taste and the scallops were borderline overdone. There was zero wine taste, little garlic and little butter. Again when I commented, the waiter said he would tell the chef. No offer of any price change. I asked if the staff ahd changed and he said it is same people for the 5 years he has been working there ( i have never seen him before, but don't go on Fridays a lot either.  The manger at the bar was never told about my complaint and sat totally silent as I stood right next to her while waiting for a tee shirt for an out of town friend. Any decent manager would have struck up some hokey conversation with a customer standing around for 5 minutes. This lady spoke not one word to me. How hard would it have been to say, \"how was everything, why you all dressed up in a suit, thanks and come back again.  Tillies has enough locals to keep it alive for a while.   With this type of disregard for an unhappy customer, who knows how long they will last though. Uncaring staff is sure way to lose business.  I have cooked and eaten scampi since the 70's and this was one of the poorest examples I have ever seen. How hard is butter, garlic, salt and pepper, and finish with white wine and parsley?   I could go to Eat 'n Park and get better than this and pay 1/2 of what I paid.",
