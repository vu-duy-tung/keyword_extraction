As a lesbian it seemed cauttivo was my only bar option and I really didn't like it.  So I'm glad I found this little gem that has a good mix of guys and gals.

Good atmosphere, no more cigarette smoke, gotta check it out gay or not.",

Even if you need to get away from the crowd- the patio is it!  The bar itself is spacious, there is one on the first floor, and one on the second. On the first floor, there is an iTunes electronic juke box, which is awesome to play some of your favorite hits, even the ones that you normally wouldn't be able to find on a top 10 list! There is a decent space to dance to the hits you just picked and paid for and everyone is doing their own thing, so it's not like people are staring at you. There are also bar stools around this area where you can throw your stuff on and dance the night away! The nacho appetizer was really good and the drinks aren't too expensive! On the second floor, you can sit at booths, play darts, or enjoy the spacious area around the bar! This is, by far, one of my favorite places to go and enjoy the night!",

The drinks are good and people will openly come up to you and dance and say \"hi.\" It's dominated by men mostly, but if you just want to meet friends or you're a guy looking to meet another guy, this place is perfect.   It might not be a New York bar or whatever, but this isn't New York last I noticed. The guys here are well-dressed and the bar is classy.  It's always pretty packed on the patio out back, and they play up-to-date music and remixes.  The only negative thing is I can say that one of their male bartenders hit on my one night, even though he knew I was with my fiancee (who's a girl btw). I went to buy a glass of wine and ref-fill my fiancee's drink, and he kept asking me questions and was really blatantly flirting and it was awkward...he told me that I was cute and he wouldn't let me pay for my own drink! That was the only time I went to that particular bartender that night, after that I stuck to the bartender on the patio and everything was fine.  Overall though, really fun bar. Never went and had a bad time. It's classy and although not filled with an equal ratio of men to women, it's really easy to meet people.",

(and they all kind of look like they were rejected from Los Angeles)  The music is the worst,  typical gay pop remixes blare from this place. When will gay bars realize that we aren't in the late 90's anymore?  The interior is decorate and reminiscent of a Radisson hotel lobby. (Which isn't good) The bartenders are neither pretty nor polite. I don't recommend this place at all.",

First, our server, Mahogany, could not have been more patient with a group of 10-15 who showed up on a Long Island Iced Tea night ($3.50 a pop every Thursday on the daily drink special rotation), wanted separate checks and a million appetizers, and lingered until close. I'm sure we were very annoying, and service did slow a bit as happy hour picked up, but overall, it was great. All of the appetizers range between $3 to $5, and while they are slightly-above-average bar fare kinds of dishes (sweet potato fries, red pepper hummus, mac & cheese wedges, etc.), they were all very satisfying and well portioned for the price. We happened to be there in fair weather and stuck to a corner of the patio, and it felt like we had our own private area. I'd definitely go for happy hour and snacks again.",

They usually have drink specials. Outside on the patio is where 5801 really becomes something special. Lots of space and seating, but with all of the tiki torches and paper lanterns around, after a few drinks you'd swear you were at a summer block party.   The staff has always been nice, the drinks have always been stiff, and I've never run into any drama at 5801.

It has changed (aesthetically) quite a bit recently, and the newest addition in the upstairs / patio area is gorgeous. It has a new, lodge type feel, which I'm all about.   Unfortunately, nothing has been done to vent the smells. It's the only bar that I still reek of cigarettes and regret when I leave and my clothes (really annoying with your coats in the winter) forever hold the smell until washed well. This alone almost always makes me not want to go there, but I think it has become a very comfortable, \"everyday\" bar for the lgbt crowd, and I find that even a lot of non-lgbt people don't mind the atmosphere as well.  Stick with beer here, too. I don't mind the mixed drinks, but I've never been a big fan. They seem to use cheap mixers (especially sours) and I often do not enjoy the drinks as much as other places ---- but they are usually affordable and larger, so I guess it's a trade off.",

I LOVE the cocktails, especially for their names, like \"Platinum Blonde\" and \"Smurf Cum\" - absolutely delicious, and you can't taste the booze at all. the \"upstairs\" bar was not too loud so best friend and I could actually carry a conversation without shouting, which seems a bit backwards considering the lounge bar is smaller and more intimate, but the music (while great) is BLARING.  each bar has a different atmosphere, which is also pretty cool. I'm also glad that they welcome all genders, so that my best friend could walk in with his token straight girl with no trouble ;)",

    "text": "\"580-1309\"  This place is enormous.  I am not actually sure I saw the whole thing!  Suggest doing a lap before you commit to a location.  As a NY'er I was shocked you could smoke inside!  Unfortunately this was where the cute guys were.  So I had to invest in Febreeze.  Fine.  Fun place, and easy to go with a group of friends.  Many spots to hide if you need to.  The patio was such a pleasant surprise, felt like I was back in NY.  P.S. this place def has its regulars and if you're from out of town they sniff you out like a bad gallon of milk.  Not sure where the video part comes from but wasn't a deal breaker.   The vodka came out of a soda gun which was worrisome, so don't expect a jacked up drink, its to the measure.  Bartenders were all super sweet.  That being said I don't know why almost everyone here was WASTED but me?",

With a large space, fully equipped with 3 separate bars (1 on a fairly newly reconstructed outdoor porch venue), dart boards, and a small dance floor, it meets the needs of almost anybody who stops in for a good time. 5801 has a poker night, darts league, and is just a place for the gays to feel comfortable and have a good time at. I would say that this is the gay bar with the most diverse crowd in Pittsburgh- gay mens, lesbians, straight men and women, etc. Smokers enjoy the downstairs bar, while upstairs is non-smoking. Pretty good music, good daily specials and pretty nice bartenders- this is not a bad way to spend a night out.",

I've been here in all kinds of circumstances....straight from work at 5 pm (when we were basically the only people there), and also at 2 am on the crowded dance floor.  The music is great, the patio is expansive and comfortable, and the bartenders are really friendly.   Their happy hour actually doesn't start until 6, but I like that because that gives me time to actually GET there - usually when bars have happy hours that start at 5 pm, I've already missed half of it by the time I arrive.  They have a creative martini list and the bartenders are willing to make you surprise creations if you aren't sure what to order.  I've only had a little bit of food here - spinach/artichoke dip, hummus, sweet potato fries, buffalo chicken dip - all were perfectly tasty, a step above regular bar food quality.  Everyone is comfortable and welcome here.  My boyfriend and I had a fantastic time dancing here late one night, and we love how they play music videos!  Sometimes we'd just stop talking, drift off, and watch the videos.  I'll give it 5 stars just because it's been consistently great, service is super friendly, clientele is awesome (this is the kind of place where you make new \"best friends\" in 5 minutes), and it's good for both a chill drink and a crazy dance-off depending on when you show up.",

    "text": "In short, bartender steph selectively provides very terrible customer service to some customers but the managers are understanding if you have an issue. Here's why...   I go to this bar very infrequently and generally have an okay experience but the above rating is due to very terrible customer service we received from two of the bartenders (Steph specifically) on the same night.   Started with ordering a shandy. The drink tasted nothing like shandy but my friend drank it anyway just to not cause any trouble only to find out later from another employee (steph) that they actually don't have shandys. Rather than simply saying they don't have the it, they proceeded to give us something that \"tastes like\" it without even letting us know. Bartender's response when I confronted him was \"it's the closest we got\" while rolling his eyes. Since when is this acceptable?  Long story short, I calmly requested a refund for that drink since they clearly knowingly gave us the wrong drink... In return I get zero apologies, an angry bartender (steph) starting to scream asking me if I wanted a shot and telling me to bring the drink back if I wanted a refund. I tried to deescalate her incivility and she immediately started to not acknowledge that I was even there or that there was an issue. At this point, I asked her name, which she lied about and told me was \"samantha\". I spoke to the manager who seemed understanding of the ridiculousness of the situation and terrible customer service provided by his employees and refunded my drinks. Otherwise the atmosphere is just ok. Lots of smoking etc. I probably will not be going back for a while.",

We were greeted warmly on arrival by a very nice woman named Alexis (i believe) who gave us all the information we needed about the bar (where the smoking and non smoking areas were, where the bathrooms were located,  the dart area, outdoor bar, etc).  The bar is much larger than it looks from the outside.  It was nicely decorated for Christmas.  Our waiter was super friendly and checked on us often.  Better service than we've received at most restaurants.  We had already eaten dinner but it had been a few hours so we decided to order a few appetizers (garlic knots and zucchini planks), both were really good. As were the drinks.  A video DJ started around 10 and the music was good and has us dancing in our seats and out.  Lol. Wish we had a bar like this in our hometown.  I would highly recommend..",

I would say come here if you want to have a conversation with your friends, for a beer after work, or to pregame your night out. There is a downstairs bar, an upstairs bar, and a patio bar. There are booths, bar stools, hightop tables, and standing room. I always get a little nervous around the combination of drinking and darts, though.",

But you must never go there. Nope. Because the secret must never get out that 5801 has some of the most DELICIOUS and CHEAP bar food in Pittsburgh. Those capitalized words? They usually don't go hand in hand. Not so at 5801. They have found the magic formula for quality bites that won't hurt your wallet. The menu has something for everybody. Eight types of dips/chips to share, wraps, salads, even pizza and wings! Everything I have had there is large portioned and yummy.   As for the environment, it varies according to day of the week and area of the lounge. As others have said before, smoking is still permitted downstairs. However, 5801 is so large that you can avoid the nicotine by either going upstairs or enjoying your drinks and watching the game on the large outdoor patio and bar.   Stay away, though! I don't want crowds getting in on my $3.75 long island Thursdays and daily happy hour specials (6-8 pm).   ...  Ok, fine. You can come. I hope to see you all there!",

The thing I love most about this place is the space. It's actually pretty big! The first floor is the smoker's bar as smoking is allowed. They have bar seating as well as high tables and a jukebox with any song you could imagine. I tend to stay away from this area because of the smoke. The second floor (non-smoking) consists of a bigger bar, booths and dart boards. Their latest addition is the spacious outdoor patio which is accessible from the second floor. Half of it is outside and the other half is indoors with the bar in the middle that separates the two.   Drinks are always very good! I never had a bad one. My favorite is their Long Island which is on special on Thursday I believe. Bartenders are usually very friendly as well.  If you're hungry, they have a kitchen that's open till around 11. I've only had their nachos, but they were very good and loaded to the brim. You won't find a steak and potato dinner, but a classier type of bar food.   Weekends are usually busy here and they do have decent specials throughout the week to get people in the door. They also hold bingo games once a week hosted by a drag queen. Crowd is usually mixed as well.",

At the time I went, there was some music but no dancing yet, and the pens game was on which could have been why dancing wasn't happening yet.

Don't get me wrong, I love being there on a busy night when it's crowded and you can hardly move, but I've come to embrace the off nights where there is hardly anyone there.  It has come to be my place to go when I just want to get a drink and chat.  That is what most *insert my day of choice here* have become (I truly don't want to say what day it is for fear that it may become crowded on that night).    And the remodel, can we talk about the remodel for a minute?  It's wonderful!  I'm so happy that they finally got rid of the doorway that divided the upstairs room, talk about bottle necking in a bar, now no more.  It also feels brighter upstairs and bigger.  Could be that they got rid of some walls, maybe that had something to do with it.  I cannot wait for warmer weather.  Not because everyone is going to be out in shorts and sleeveless shirts, but because of the amazing remodel of the deck.  Where the bar now resides, it feels like a ski lodge.  You walk in and you can smell the wood.  This little addition also adds more seating for people during hours they are open for food.  During the summer months looks as if they have the garage door openings to open the bar to the deck...away from the door openings to the deck, best part about the remodel I think.  And for those that complain about the cigarette smoke, with all the complaining you keep doing I'm sure you'll have this as a smoke free place.  Smoking is now restrained to the lower bar, away from the door.  No smoking in any other part of the building.",

I visited the 5801 Video Lounge on Saturday, August 31, 2013 during Labor Day weekend.  80% of the bar's patrons were straight - heterosexual couples.  There were a few Gay people scattered throughout the bar but in no way would I call this place a Gay bar.  The place looks good but not all that special.  It kind of reminded me of Applebee's for some reason. It could use a good cleaning. The carpets for example were dirty and even sticky in some places.  At the upstairs bar, for 20 minutes, I tried unsuccessfully to get a drink from any of the bartenders there. They were ignoring me. It was as if they were avoiding myself and my partner.  We don't smoke and really were trying to avoid the downstairs bar because they allow smoking but since we were being ignored by the bartenders upstairs who were too busy serving the straight couples we reluctantly went to the downstairs bar to try and get drinks.  At the smoky downstairs bar, the bartender did approach me but when I asked for Black Velvet, they didn't have it. So then, I asked for Canadian Club and again they did not have it.  I really felt as though this bar did not want us there and weren't going to serve us.  Black Velvet and Canadian Club are both fine Canadian whiskeys that are staples at almost all bars and I found it unbelievable that they did not have both of them.  The bartenders ignored us or told us no. I never want to walk into an establishment and hear the word \"no\".  They should always say \"yes\" and that did not happen for us.  I also observed the bartenders using those automatic shot measuring devices.  I absolutely hate that.  How do I know I am even getting a full shot of booze with those things.  If they need to measure, I want to see them use a shot glass so I can see what I am paying for.  Anyway, after seeing the automatic shot measuring devices, I was pretty sure the drinks were very weak.  There is a patio on the backside. It is not a beautiful patio as described by some of the reviewers.  When I was there, it was jam-packed with smokers and there was standing-room only.  The patrons were not friendly in 5801 either. AND, worst of all, because of inaccurate reviews on Yelp, Urban Spoon and Gay Cities, I ended up visiting this bar and wasting my valuable vacation time on a Saturday night when I could have gone somewhere else.  There is no dance floor. Other reviewers mention that there is a dance floor. I could not find one anywhere. Perhaps, it used to be located where the dart boards are now.  I was ignored by the upstairs bartenders.  The drinks they do make are weak.  I was unable to get my drink in this bar.  The bartenders and the patrons were unfriendly. It is not a Gay bar.  I do not recommend it.",

    "text": "It was my first time visiting Pittsburgh and I was in the neighborhood, so I stopped in shortly after they opened for a drink and something to eat. It was somewhat quiet inside, as they had just opened (it was around 5:00 pm) but the manager and bartender were both incredibly friendly and welcoming and fun to talk to.  I also appreciated the fact the bartender and other staff made an effort to talk to all of their patrons - both young and old. Sometimes, I feel like the older customers get ignored. The bartender I spoke to the most (I forgot his name) but he was blonde, in his early 20's and worked the middle area bar. He couldn't have been nicer and more accommodating.  The place also has a really nice, large outdoor patio area with an outside bar and the whole space, in general, has a pleasant, modern vibe to it.  Sadly, I could only stay for a short while as I had to run, but I will def. come back next time I'm in Pittsburgh!",

    "text": "Because Pittsburgh's Queer scene is small, I have come to this bar a lot over the last few years. As a Queer person, I want to like and support this bar. They've been around for a while and they've been making a lot of improvements (great outdoor area, new bar top, better bathrooms). The door woman is AMAZING! Their garlic knots are the best.   Unfortunately, these are the only good things I have to say and this PRIDE weekend reinforced everything I've ever felt about this place. There is no dance floor. The beer on tap seems to always be the same. Most of the food is terrible. The 'first bar' when you walk in is smoking. The worst part is regular year-round crowd is white, male, and gay. If you are anyone else, you are ignored to the point of invisibility by the bartenders and patrons. There is no diversity and little respect/inclusion of differences.  This PRIDE weekend the bartenders were completely understaffed - a failure on management. That being said - there is no excuse for ignoring femme looking women and then yelling at them when questioned about it. There was one side of the bar that was completely femme looking women who hadn't been acknowledged for 7-10 minutes. I'm not mad about not being served, that place was packed and understaffed. But not looked at or told they'd be with us in a minute then yelled at when asked about it is ridiculous. I however wasn't surprised and left immediately. That is the status quo at this place - unwelcoming if you aren't white, male, and gay.   Trust me - I get that this a gay bar. I had hoped it was the modern definition of gay bar(LGBTQIA+) - not the 1980's version(gay men).",

Funnel cake in the form of easy to eat \"fries.\" The only think they're missing is chocolate sauce, but I continue to order them with just the powdered sugar and I am always happy.  The other reason I keep coming back to 5801 is the happy hour. 6-8pm with buy one, get one free classic appetizers. I personally love funnel cake fries (duh), zucchini planks, mac and cheese wedges, any type of fries, and the pretzel sticks. And even with that extensive list, they have at least 5 more options that make the cut for the buy one get one list.   The 90s music that is always playing on all the TVs is pretty awesome, and the device is consistently good. I recommend sitting on the patio if possible.",

I am really allergic to cigarette smoke, so for that reason I usually sit up at the bar on the 2nd level, right before you go outside.  The thing I like about this place is that you'll like it not matter what you're in the mood for, patio, or usually in my case finding a quieter spot in a wooden booth.  They have a good selection of beers, and they make a damn good bloody mary.  The bartenders, waitstaff and clientele are all warm and welcoming.  I have never had a bad time at this place!  The outdoor patio is really nice, but the last time I was there people are smoking, so it was no bueno for me.  It's beautiful since its been remodeled.",

It's got three separate bars on different levels. They just completed renovations on, and opened the patio, which is great. There's an outdoor heating lamp for when it gets cold.   A lot of people don't realize, but 58 is also a full restaurant with waiter service. Sometimes it takes them a while to get to you if it's busy, but this is probably the only one of it's kind in this city. The food is a step above typical greasy bar food, and they always have interesting specials that usually run for a week or so.
