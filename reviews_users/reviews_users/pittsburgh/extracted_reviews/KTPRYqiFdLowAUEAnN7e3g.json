Cons are long waits and the seats at the \"tall tables\" are very narrow and uncomfortable. I have been recommending it to all my friends. But don't be boring...get a crazy different mix of toppings, rubs, etc. Make it worth the wait by getting something that you can't get elsewhere.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I have dined here many times.  The first time we went the wait was 2 hours.  Since we were not exactly close to home we waited it out and that first time and only time, the service and he food met my expectations; hence why we returned way more than anyone should.  This place is progressively getting worse.  The staff is overly sure of themselves since the waits are always 1.5-2.5 hours.  As I mentioned we do not live close to here so we started to call before we headed out to see if we wanted to wait that long.  (They refuse to take reservations nor can you call ahead).  The last time that i called the man that answered the phone was very snotty and said very rudely \"You know you can check the time on-line.  You should do that.\"  Aside from the progressively rude staff, we still enjoyed the quality of the burger we ordered until... They suddenly raised the prices on many of the build-able items.  I would not necessarily have an issue with that except they put less and less actually on the burger!  My boyfriend ordered his with the hot sauce and there was literally a drop on it.  He asked the waitress for some more since there was hardly any on the burger and she actually charged him an extra dollar for it!  We have stopped going there and have begun to go to wingharts.  They keep up their deteriorating service and quality and they will be shut sooner than later.  You cannot have people wait 2-3 hours for food and service it poorly!",

Service was good but in all honesty, she didn't have much to do.  I ordered a custom burger, pink center on a brioche with lettuce, tomato, pickle, mayo and ketchup.  It was above average but overcooked and not anything special.  The accompanying chips were also overcooked and not particularly tasty.  I really wanted to love the place, but for my money, I'll walk up the street to Murray Ave Grill for an exceptionally juicy, tasty burger that is actually cooked to order.",

    "text": "We didn't wait at the beginning of Happy Hour and quickly got a booth for 4 in this small yet trendy bar is central with some booths and tables.  As it was Happy Hour - Yes - we quickly ordered a selection of the half off appetizers and drafts. Quite a deal  Beer - Yes - ever-changing selection of 12, some unusual.  Sliders - Yes - 3 - chicken, bison, beef - on delicious brioche rolls. These were the best thing we ordered. I would have wished each to have a different personality but they all had cheese and a pickle. We liked the chicken best and though the other two were slightly different we couldn't (nor could our server) tell which was which (note to Burgatory - put a different marker on one of them). Sadly they were a bit dry which may not reflect on the regular size burgers that we didn't try. I'm a toppings person when it comes to burgers to that decreased my enjoyment of the selections. A homemade pickles/toppings bar like Michael Symon's B Spot would be welcome. We should have stopped with just these.   Mushroom Fries - No - as other reviews highlight the large battered portabello fries and I love mushrooms I was looking forward to but disappointed by these. I was pulling the batter off and then wiping copious grease off my fingers before trying to enjoy the plain mushrooms. Perhaps leaving the gills/underside of the large pieces makes the coating wet when it goes into the frier? Not sure but a mistake. And I love peanut sauce and could discern some peanut-y flavor - maybe from peanut oil - in the dip but I'd call the black thin sauce Asian or Soy or something other than peanut that I expect to be thicker and more peanut-y.  Side of fries - were fine.  Wings - these were okay. The skins were a bit rubbery but edible and tasty. We were disappointed though because they were called Siracha Wings which sounded awesome. We expected a spicy, hot and red wing. These were natural colored with a thin Asian style sauce and a sprinkle of sesame seeds and scallions. Far too mild for us.  I would go back if I were in the area to try the bigger burgers, the veggie burger, milkshakes and more drafts but I would not drive across town to go here.",

Got there around 7:30 and told there was a twenty to thirty minute wait which was fine with me because I can always shop, but we were seated within ten minutes.  No one was super starving, so we skipped on appetizers.  Solid beer selection which pleased our group.  They also have alcoholic milkshakes.  One person ordered the granddad.  Holy booze - this shake was delicious, but there big and strong so be careful!!  BURGERs:  You can choose from organic, free range beef, bison, chicken breast or a veggie burger for all of the burgers.  I don't eat a lot of red meat, so when I go all in when I get a burger!  Two of us got the Monty; peppercorn rub, horseradish cheese with a Cabernet sauce and onions... SO GOOD.  Ordered medium rare and they were perfect.  Other side of the table did the custom burgers and they were extremely happy as well.  Burgers come with homemade potato chips, but you can also substitute fries and coleslaw too.  Chips were great, and the fries were good too (they had some kind of rosemary seasoning).  By the end of dinner, everyone's plate was empty.  Service was great too!  Bottom line: Check it out.",

As a fan of Uncle Sams, I had been keeping my eye on the progress of the location. I finally went last night, and to my suprise, I was very disappointed.   I ordered the standard burger, thinking it would be hard to mess up something so original. The burger was over cooked and weet (maybe next to a burger that had some sort of spice rub on it?). I liked the white american cheese rather than cheddar, but overall, I was disappointed in the taste and the ability of the chef to cook an adequate burger.   The dinner partner had a bison burger, which was, to be nice, extremely overcooked. In fact, if you pulled it off the bun, the bun was black from charring and burning. It was so dry it was falling off in pieces when he bit into it.   I did like the idea of buidling your own burger, which he did, and liked, again, minus the ability of the chef to adequately cook a burger.   Other problems: had the onion rings, which looked fabulous, but definately undercooked. There was so much batter on them (not bad) that it didn't cook the whole way through. This equals mushy onion rings!",

The build your own burger is a great idea with a ton of unconventional condiments that you wont see at just any burger shack. I recommend the all natural beef burger on brioche with spicy ketchup, onion straws, farmhouse cheddar cheese, arugula, and the angel dust rub.  If thats not enough reason to go then lets talk about their milkshakes. Spiked or not they are excellent. I had the pretzel milkshake which gives you that sweet and salty combo and then stepped up to their banana foster milkshake spiked with banana liquor among other ingredients.  Burgatory is like Pittsburghs version of Burger Bar in Las Vegas. The only thing I would like to see on the menu in the future is an option for kobe beef.",

This place is the real deal and a must-go!  They have a little burger form (best form you'll ever fill out) with the biggest variety of sauces/patties/freebies/additions/anything you could ever want.  My perfect burger: - a brioche bun  - an angel dust rub on my beef (salt/pepper) - arugula (they have at least 3 diff spins on typical lettuce-iceberg, arugula, romaine, etc) - tomato - bacon - fried egg - guacamole + crispy homemade potato chips (and bbq flavored too)  This was a very tall glass of burger.  You can also have it different ways as my other friends did - topless ( no bun on top), full monty (no bun at all), or with a salad (healthy!).  The chips were perfect, crispy, warm, and flavorful.  Have never been to this \"wingharts\" place that everyone else seems to rave about but right now I couldn't imagine anything better than Burgatory!",

The space is really nice--and both evenings it was pleasantly crowded but not oppressively so. Burgers were great. Good choices for beer/ drinks. We visited twice and really loved the salads - as they were fresh, crunchy and robust.",

    "text": "Burgatory, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.  Come on, it's a build your own burger bar, and it's fantastic. Add-ons on top of add-ons for those with poor self control and little regard for what makes a sensible burger (you mean I can put a fried egg on top AND have 2 kinds of cheese AND bacon? it's a good thing I don't eat like this all the time) means it could cost a pretty penny, but the entire experience is so worth it. If you have a love/hate relationship with your intestines, go for the milkshakes as well. The waitstaff has always been nothing short of friendly and attentive and seem pretty genuinely jazzed to be there, and so should you.  I can't say for all days of the week, but the wait is usually ~45 minutes in my experience. Troll around Barnes and Noble for a while, and let the spirit of the Waterworks wash over you.  They've opened up a new spot at the Waterfront, and it might be a bigger space, but the OG location has won my heart.",

We just check in before we leave the house.   They usually have a good selection of beers on tap or you can start with a milkshake. Love the caramel pretzel but it's so rich you need at least 3 people to drink it.   The sriracha wings are ridiculously good and we always get an order I start. Don't love the blue cheese but honestly you don't even really need it.   They recently added the potluck dinner and I am obsessed with it. It's over the top and so good. Before I found the potluck I would build my own and loved the variety of toppings. Morty's steakhouse is another good one. I usually upgrade my chips to a salad or fries. Love the salad their house dressing is good and it has sunflower seeds, parm, and roasted tomatoes.   Service is usually pretty good. Just plan ahead and use the no wait app or you'll have to wait 1.5+ hours on a weekend night.",

I had the Meet the Maker burger and didn't change a thing, napa slaw and iced tea. Delicious flavor but the bun fell apart at the end so I fork and knifed it. Not a huge deal because it was scrumptious. The place is a bit loud for dinner and we had a 45 minute wait. We are from out of town and visiting friends so we were committed to waiting. It wound up only being a 20 minute wait.  Service was really friendly and hip waitrons with ink and personality, totally my kind of place.  If we visit the area again we will surely make it back.",

It was happy hour, so I enjoyed the house margarita (yum) but my husband went straight for the apple pancakes & bacon milkshake (sounds awful but is tasty).  Our waiter didn't tell us apps were half priced, or we probably would have gotten one (we only knew about the drink special because I saw it on yelp).  Probably a good thing though...neither of us were able to finish our dinners anyways :)  I went with the build your own creation (buffalo burger on brioche with buffalo cheddar, buttermilk ranch & some veggies)...my husband went for the meet your maker burger.  Both were delicious...though I didn't love the ranch (I'd probably go for something more interesting).  I subbed my chips for fries (loved 'em)...the chips were decent but I wanted more potato.  Reasonably priced...decent service...if we lived in Pittsburgh, it would be on our regular list :)",

    "text": "My friends insisted we go here, so we checked it out. I must say, it's a hidden gem in the Waterworks strip mall. We were lucky to get seated right away because we went in around 11:45 on a Sunday morning.  First, the entryway decor let's you know they're serious about their restaurant, and once you're inside, you can tell that it's going to be a great experience. The decor is sort of like a barn/pub with its dark wood. During colder weather, they have standalone heaters that shoot flames through a tube, which were blowing my mind. The theme of Purgatory was kept through the menu design, and I liked the succinct but varied options.  Service was great and helpful. Our waiter walked me through the \"create your own burger\" option by explaining different menu items when I had questions. He also was helpful in getting me a plain vanilla milkshake that is not listed on the menu. By the way, the milkshakes here are awesome. I'm glad to pay $6 for one because of the quality and quantity. They topped it off with a large mountain of fresh whipped cream and a Nilla wafer. Anyway, back to the burgers. I had a whole bunch of things thrown onto my burger (sauteed mushrooms, red onion, whole grain mustard, organic greens, etc...), all held together in a brioche bun. The ingredients they use are very good quality (the flavors came through for everything), and the beef patties are generously portioned. Oh, they also get style points because they use organic grass-fed beef as the basic burger option. The accompanying chips are pretty good as well, and I like that they also throw in sweet potato chips into the mix.   Overall, this is a great place to get your gourmet burger fix. The experience is a good one, and it's worth the slight premium. It's a bit out of the way of normal places I go in Pitts, but it's well worth the short trip out if you want to get away from the normal stuff.",

    "text": "Holy SHIT! I like a good burger, but  this was a different level. Everyone in a while 5 Guys or In 'n' Out will do, but this is in a league of its own. Just like in college when you drank what was cheap but when you graduate and make real money you drink what is quality. This is you quality burger.  5 senses review: Sight: 5- Nothing extraordinary. But you aren't going for the sights anyway. Sound: 5- It is an open space with a bunch of people, but it isn't awfully loud. Smell: 7- Lots of great smells.  Touch: 3- This depends (clearly) on what you order and how your burger comes.  Taste: 9- QUALITY! Meat, sauces, shakes!  If it wasn't for the great meal this rating would be lower. Only because of the damn popularity of this place. The wait would have been one hour to an hour and a half. When you have a 3 year old, that kind of wait is toooooo long. However, my wife and son went home to relax and my friend and I stayed, so we went to the bar and bypassed the wait.   I think the greatest thing here at Burgatory is the diversity. If it is your first time, please get a burger! Even then, the choices are plentiful. If you are someone trying to maintain a \"healthy\" style of eating, you can do that. If you want to go way off the deep end of Guinness proportion calorie intake, you can do that. Choose a burger or create your own.   I wanted an in-between experience. So I went with the topless (no top bun) grass fed Elk burger (with one of the rubs, spicy ketchup and cheese) and a Fluffer Nutter shake. The meat was amazing. Super lean, cooked perfectly and did not make me feel like I was going to fall over after eating. The shake, however did put me over the top. But it was blissful.   Service was quick!!!   The best tip is to make a reservation or sit at the bar. For as great as the food is, nothing is worth 1-1.5 hours of waiting.",

    "text": "My husband discovered Burgatory several years back while on his lunch break. He could not stop raving about it and insisted on taking me there. I'm sure glad he did! The shakes are what did it for me. I'm not much of a burger girl, but let me tell you, the meat they use is so tasty and it's always made to perfection how you request. We have never ordered anything off of the actual menu (aside from shakes), and always get our burgers made to order. In my opinion, that's the best way to go since there are SO MANY combinations you can try. If you don't have the caramel pretzel shake on your way out, you're truly missing out on dessert. My husband goes on Saturdays when there is game meat. He's tried antelope, alligator, and probably others in the past, but sorry to say that's just not my thing. He used to get the burger of the day mailed to him......complete fanatic, but unfortunately, I will say we have not been there for a while. I think too much of a good thing killed it for us a little. Every now and again I will still crave a shake. There fries are nothing spectacular, though (although the chips are tasty)--I'm a fan of beer battered and these fries just don't cut it for me. They remind me of primanti's fries. Check this place out for sure...it's a great place to stop for happy hour too, if you're not trying to gorge yourself :)  P.S. The mushroom salad they used to have is TO DIE FOR. I mean how good can a salad be, right? The answer is insanely good (maybe it was the dressing?). Unfortunately, I don't think they have this anymore, but hopefully they bring it back!!",

    "text": "Obviously, the gourmet burger joint concept has taken hold in Pittsburgh.  From reading most of the reviews, it seems like BRGR is the \"cool\" place to go and Burgatory is the \"lame\" one.  Is it because BRGR is located right next to Spoon in the middle of the East Liberty renaissance (which is terribly in danger with the huge derelict Borders festering across the street)?  I can't say, but I can tell you that Burgatory does an insanely tremendous business.  If you don't get here around when this place opens, you're in for a long wait.  This Sunday I joined a large group for lunch here at 11:30am.  The place was a madhouse by noon.  There's a variety of \"named\" burgers with set ingredients, but my favorite part of Burgatory was the ability to customize your burger.  Literally from the bun to the rub to the cheese to the type of meat to the sauce to the vegetables to the cooking time, there are millions of possible combinations.  My salt/pepper/garlic rub, Gouda, house sauce, scallions, red onions, tomatoes, and baby spinach medium rare burger was excellent.  The house made sweet potato chips were tasty as well.  I didn't roll with any of the insanely creative milkshakes (including the much discussed apple pancake and bacon vodka one), but everyone in the group said they were great.  Someone next to me got the S'mores one that actually had a toasted S'more on top.  Although we were sitting inside, Burgatory has the ability to open a wall to the outside with outdoor seating.  Great place to hang out in the summer (if you don't mind the scenery of the Waterworks mall).  This is a solid place and I'm not surprised that it's mobbed.  I'd recommend getting here early.  Don't believe anyone who says that it's in a lame location.  There's tons of free parking and after dinner you can drop by the Fox Chapel State Store (a little ways down the mall) which has some of the best wine selections in town.  Finally, as at least one reviewer already mentioned, the music they play is excellent, best I've heard in Pittsburgh.  Any place that blasts songs from Elbow's new album is definitely my kind of place.",

Two: what's up with the chairs? metal, no padding, with two tubes really constraining my butt and I am not the biggest person! Balance chic with comfy please. Positive: The best hamburger I have had in a long while. I had their traditional burger. Fab! My son piled all sorts of stuff on a chicken burger. That came out even more fabulous! I recommend going their in off peak hours. It took them longer on a previous occasion to get us seated and even longer to bring the food which was NOT the taste and quality of our burgers this time. I guess if they are not busy, they put their hearts into it.",

    "text": "Burgatory is awkwardly (awesomely??) located right in the middle of an outdoor shopping center. The internet informed me that the wait here is ridic on weekends, and when I called at 6:15 I was told there was a 2 hour wait and had to come down in person to put my name in. After some aggressive driving, getting our names in, and shopping at TJ Maxx (next door!!!), 90 minutes passed and I was TXT MSG'd that our table was ready. I replied with a winky robot face ;] but the flirtation was not mutual :'[  Before I go any further, I need to state that Xzibit is to Pimp My Ride as Jason J. is to burgers. Another simile to follow. Allow me to describe the ingredients and reasoning that I believe made the perfect burger off of the Custom Creations menu:  Bison meat: I shouldn't need to explain this, but M Bison was a force to be reckoned with in the Streetfighter games. He would have wanted my burger this way. Brioche roll: Gotta impress the ladies with my worldliness and shit. Angel Dust rub: Admittedly, I had no idea what was in it before ordering, and still don't, yet it was critical that it be all up in my bison patty. Angel Dust rub is to happiness as Angel Dust / PCP is to tripping balls. Bam. You've been double similed.  Horseradish cheddar: I was about to get the whatever cheddar then happened to glance at this wondrous combination of unlikely foodstuffs. History made. No going back. Truffled shallot aioli: I literally would have hated myself forever if I did not get this. Fried egg: You know who doesn't get fried eggs on their burgers? Assholes. And vegans. On their vegan burgers.  Applewood smoked bacon: Standard decision. I need some sort of control ingredient on all my burgers anyways. Romaine lettuce and pickles: Because sometimes I like my salads on top of my meat. Blood: If a burger isn't rare / medium rare, we have a problem.  The adorbz girlf inhaled a Meat Your Maker burger (dry aged Wagyu beef with sweet onion crust, aged Gruyere, roasted tomatoes, organic field greens and truffled shallot aioli) and my tastebuddies approved of her selection. We also ordered the truffled Gorgonzola fries which was obviously the best decision regarding fried food selection that evening. Liquid accompaniment was handled by a shake with the namesake Grand-dad's Secret (Old Grand-Dad bourbon (THE KEY TO MY HEART), caramel, ice cream, and whipped cream). Zounds.  Why does this estabilishment not exist in Boston?",

It's usually the temp of the burger - I like mine really rare - but it is also often the toppings, which is kind of a bummer when you build your own.  Regardless, even if to me it wasn't perfect, everything I've ordered there has been tasty.  (Pro tip: sure, the burgers are good but the chili is wonderful and the nachos are among the best I've ever had.  Get the nachos.)  The cocktails are really good (especially that grape/basil thing they have going), but the wine list is and has been terrible.  The beer selection is also good, and changes frequently.  As for the service, it's what you would expect from a hot spot.  The men are aloof and the women bitchy.  Ignore them.  Eat nachos.",

    "text": "Because my PIC (Partner In Cuisine) and I had our first date at Burgatory, this place holds an extra special place in my heart, but we don't simply keep going back out of some misguided nostalgia.  We keep going back because, quite simply, the place serves kickass burgers and shakes.  They not only serve beef, they serve chicken, wagyu beef, bison, crab, and veggie.  After you pick your meat, you have a ploethra of bread to choose from.  I only wish they had some type of pretzel bun.  Hint, hint if anybody at Burgatory reads these...On Saturdays, they have a wild game burger of the day in which they've been known to serve elk, bear, alligator, ostrich, etc.  If you are into trying \"exotic\" meats such as those, get there early because the wild game doesn't always last.  Burgatory's burgers come with home-made potato / sweet potato chips that are awesome, but for a slight upcharge, you can get a delicious salad made with real greens and a vinagrette.  Yum Yum.  If you get the salad, then you can balance out the awful healthiness of the salad with one of their many hard or non-alcoholic shakes made by a milkshake \"artist\" with ice cream they make in-house.   The only downside is the ridiculously long wait for a table - on a Friday or Saturday night, prepare to wait upwards of 2 hours for a table (even on a weeknight, expect at least an hour wait).  In cases of long waits and since our gluttony knows no bounds when it comes to Burgatory, there have been times with my PIC and I have gone to have a pre-dinner while waiting for a table to open up at Burgatory.  It's ridiculous actually.  I don't even know what else to say.  If you live in Pittsburgh and haven't been to Burgatory yet, you live under a rock!",

They do have some really good shakes and I think that those are the highlight of the restaurant.  Reminds me of red robbin.

I mean, who am I to create my own burger? I didn't even know what half the toppings were. That said, once I calmed down and picked all my toppings, I was rewarded with an incredibly tasty burger. I also was a bit doubtful about the milkshakes that everyone had hyped. I was happily proven wrong. My shake was delicious as well. And the nachos: they were an absolute treat.  My only complaint is that there food is so good, and they give you so much, that it's almost impossible to eat it all!  Also appreciated that they text you when your table is ready. We were able to do a little shopping at local stores including Barnes & Noble while we waited.  A must try for anyone who like burgers or shakes. Even better if, like myself, you like both!  I can't give it a 5-star rating until I prove to myself that it is consistently great. At this time, I've only been here once.",

My family not being from the city have heard me talk about this place so much that when they came down they insisted on me taking them there.    Of course when we arrived there was a wait, I told them that most likely there would be, not only because it's so good, but because we were going at a busy time.  I informed them about the system they have where they text you when you table is ready.  Walked up to the podium, gave my information and decided to check out the shops nearby.    Good thing we were only right next door, because what happened next totally floored me.  When I first went in and gave my name we were told that our wait would be anywhere from 30-45 minutes because we had a party of 5 adults and a child.  While we were browsing the racks in the store my phone rang, not knowing the number I did the typical thing and ignored it.  My phone than rang again and I told my family that I should answer it.  Burgatory went the extra mile here.  It was them that called me and told us our table was ready, not even ten minutes into our wait!  I mean I heard of having to wait longer sometimes, but never under-waiting (is that a word?).  Of course our food was delicious, my little niece was definitely digging the Salty Nutella Crunch shake we ordered.  And who can argue with those crispy mixed potato chips they give you?

While there are several standard types of burgers you can order from the menu, the burger \"money\" is to use the order sheet and choose from the many selections of buns, condiments, and cheese.  One of my friends dining with us has a cheat sheet he brings with him so he can recreate the amazing burger he made on a previous visit.  It's that good.

If atmosphere is one of apathy and not caring about the customer the food isn't even worth trying.",

    "text": "I just recently went to Burgatory and I have to tell you that I was extremely pleased with our service.  I think that I'm a little \"burgered out\" due to the proliferation of burger joints in Pittsburgh and the surrounding areas.  In order for me to give high praise, you really have to do something outstanding with your menu, service, decor, etc....  Burgatory provides a nice environment, solid menu options and great service.  However, when you compare their offerings to other burger joints, it's just equally appealing to the other burger restaurants.  We went during their \"Happy Hour\" last Friday where you can order their appetizers and beer at half off the menu price, as well as $5 well drinks.  Great deal if you can get there between 4-6pm.  Because of the price, I decided to go with appetizers for my meal.  I ordered the Fire kissed Sriracha wings, Moo Better Blues sliders, Sea Salt and Herb Pommes Frites and the Bangkok Steak Fries.  My daughter and I split the apps and my sister and niece ordered individual customized burgers.  Additionally, my daughter, niece and sister ordered milkshakes and I ordered Mike's Scratch Margarita.  The fresh cut fries were exactly as I expected them to be: hot, crispy and well seasoned. That may not seem like much, but I can't tell you how many times I've been to a restaurant that specialized in \"burgers\" and then the proprietors screwed things up by serving wishy-washy frozen fries. Ugh!  The wings were well done and the sliders were tasty.  Additionally, the $5 \"Rita\" had some mojo behind it. (You know how \"some\" restaurants water down their well drinks on special...  This was not the case.  Whew-wee!)  My only compalint was that the Bangkok Steak Fries (actually tempura fried portobello mushrooms) were on the greasy/heavy side.  Good idea gone wrong because of a leaden tempura batter.  Tempura batters should be light and extremely crispy which allows the food being fried to shine through.  This did not happen.  All in all, a very pleasant visit and a very reasonably priced meal.",

Seeing some of the burgers coming out of the kitchen, I opted for the smaller lunch burger, the Jucy Lucy. It was simply fantastic! Great brioche bun, crisp lettuce, savory garlic mayo and crunchy bread and butter pickles. The burger was perfectly cooked and featured a white American cheese center (caution here - the cheese was molten hot!).  And while the burger was really good, the house made chips were amazing... almost equally split between regular potatoes and sweet potatoes, lightly salted. Delicious! Great combo.  Cool place. Neat decor and funny twists on biblical passages like 'honor thy burger'.  Definitely going back to Burgatory the next time I'm in Pittsburgh.",

They do not skimp out on the cheese. We enjoyed every part of this appetizer. For our burgers we ordered the Elk Burger and the Meat Your Maker Burger. Our favorite was the Meat Your Maker burger. It had great flavor and was just perfect. It was made with dry aged wagyu beef with sweet onion crust, aged gruyere, roasted tomatoes, organic greens and truffled shallot aioli.

    "text": "Maybe it was because I was famished...or maybe it's that good. Either way, this place is great option for a burger if you're in the area.  VENUE: As to be expected with most popular restaurants, the place was packed. It's got a sports bar vibe to it. Expect a lot of people, expect noise, and expect Sports Center to be on (woot woot).   FOOD/DRINK: I ordered the ELK GONE WILD, Medium rare. The meat is lean but flavorful. The rub gives it a great amount of flavor and the veggies and sauce don't overpower it. Even though it's a sizable piece of meat, you don't feel like you're stuffing yourself since the meat is less fatty than a regular cow beef burger.  CARAMEL PRETZEL MILKSHAKE. Just do it. There are bits of pretzel in it and it's not too sweet. I can't even. SO GOOD.  SERVICE: Our server was pretty nice and attentive - or as much as he could be given the amount of tables he was serving. We came around 2 PM on a Saturday. Not sure if it was because of the Holiday (MLK) but it was PACKED. Expect some sort of wait unless you're magic and get there at a time when there's less people. We waited 30-45minutes and they give you a notification via text so you can walk around the area. I recommend walking two minutes to the Barnes & Noble down the way. The time goes by much faster when you're reading and being an intellectual of sorts...or at least pretending to do so.",

    "text": "I feel like I've been waiting forever to go to Burgatory. I was reading reviews like some people read trashy romance novels. Lusting over descriptions of meaty juicy burgers and grown up milkshakes. Let me rephrase that DECADENT grown up milkshakes.  I don't know when I became so impatient, but the 75 minutes wait felt like ETERNITY. I think my biggest issue is that now that restaurants use a text or call to your cell phone, it often times seems as if people are just walking in and being sat before us. The weather was mild though so sitting outside on the bench was nice.   The interior, while small is very hip and clean. Great signs and branding through the space. Concrete and brick floors and high ceilings. It does follow along with the current trend of very dark eateries though, I don't want buzzing fluorescent lighting but I would like to see my food when it comes out.  My all opted for Build Your Own burgers. Two of us getting beef while the other two got veggie burgers. I ordered mine red inside and it was mostly pink. I would have been surprised if it had come out red inside though as most places don't want to accommodate that. Everything about the burger was great from the flavor of the meat (no rub) to the huge slice of pineapple, to the sharp provolone cheese, and Bourbon BBQ sauce.   Honestly, even this morning all I can think about is the red velvet cupcake milkshake with cake infused vodka in it. I can still taste it. Topped with whipped cream and a red velvet cake lollipop dipped in  chocolate and a cherry pie filling type drizzle.  Our waitress was very attentive, the food came very quickly, and while our friends who had the veggie burgers didn't seem stoked on the mushy texture, I couldn't have been happier with my meal.",

    "text": "Still on a quest to find a tasty burger in Pittsburgh, my boyfriend and I brought an out-of-town guest to Burgatory on a Friday night.  I knew there would be a wait, since people mention that in all the reviews, but I figured it was one of those things where they say it's a 90 minute wait, but really it's 45 minutes, you know?  Yeah, not so.  They said 75-90 minutes, and I believe it truly was 90.  Wowza.  The place was packed with people waiting.  If it wasn't so cold out, we'd have gone for a walk or something - they have a great text message alert system so they text you when your table is ready.  We just got some beers at the bar - they had Strongbow cider on tap! - and jealously watched everyone else sitting down to eat.  After forever, we got to sit down.  Service moved pretty quickly after that.  We all did the build-your-own burger option, feeling slightly overwhelmed by the decisions.  All their beef is hormone-free, which is nice, so I had no qualms about getting the regular beef burger.  I got a whole wheat bun, cracked peppercorn rub, farmhouse cheddar cheese, roasted garlic mayo, applewood smoked bacon, avocado, arugula, and caramelized onion marmalade on mine.  Also ordered fries instead of the usual potato chips that come with, but since I was so hungry and had consumed 2 beers, I can't say whether there was an extra charge for that or not.  Probably.  But I wasn't paying attention.  I did pay attention when I took my first bite of the burger - wow.  Juicy and flavorful, perfect medium rare, leaps and bounds above any burger we've tried yet in Pittsburgh.  The roasted garlic mayo was great, the avocado was fresh, and the bacon was perfectly crispy.  There was a generous side of small, crispy fries which were the perfect accompaniment.  Everyone loved their meals - I know my cohorts got fried eggs on theirs, which they enjoyed - and we all agreed it was a meal worth the wait.  I'd love to come back here - it reminds me of The Counter in Chicago, another great custom burger joint - but that wait is seriously killer.  If I return, it'll have to be on a day when I'm really in no hurry at all.  90 minutes is a long time to stand around, watching delicious food go past.  But there's a reason this place is so popular - whoever is cooking the burgers and sourcing their ingredients really knows what they are doing.",

I kept trying to drop in on the place before and after movies and the place consistently had at least a 45 minute wait to be seated. So...it took a good long time before I actually got to sit down and eat there.  So did it live up to the hype???  NOT AT ALL.  I ordered there most basic burger, hoping to taste the quality of the meat and how well it was cooked. Just like most red blooded American Males, I'm very serious about my burgers. I was disgusted with this burger and the fries. Note: I did not order any special rubs or hoopla of any sorts. I wanted to see what they were working with. The burger itself was disgustingly sweet. The only thing I could compare it to was Nutmeg. YEA, a meat patty doused in Nutmeg. It was gross. Same for the fries, they were also dusted with this foul concoction. It was an unpalatable mess.  People are still raving over it. I don't get it. There are better places to get burgers in the city.  The place is straight-up unimpressive.",

Just to give an idea of what you can expect to spend, a \"build your own burger\" and a Yuengling was about $13. Also if you are getting there during the dinner rush expect a 30-45 minute wait, fortunately there are plenty of things to keep you occupied near by.

The atmosphere and the decor were relevant to the theme. My burger; a buffalo bison on toasted foccacia with romaine, sun-dried tomatoes, sharp provolone, house ketchup, and whole grain mustered was spiced with \"angel dust.\" I am not exaggerating in saying that it was the best burger I've ever had.  My only gripe was that the waitress was somewhat forgetful but I chalk that up this being a new joint rather than anything detrimental. She was otherwise very friendly and did a great job.",

    "text": "One of the best burgers in the Burgh!  This place is always packed and so glad they keep opening more locations. They do not take reservations but are on the NoWait app. We used this app on a Saturday night and were able to get seated right away once we arrived.  Our waiter had an attitude but oh well.  The shakes are amazing and reasonably priced.  I love the salted caramel pretzel-topped with whipped cream and caramel and mixed with vanilla ice cream and pretzel bites. I also recommend the Nutella crunch.  They also have a nice list of beers including many options for a draft or bottle.  We then started with the shredded pork nachos. They were spicy with jalapenos, guacamole, cheese and olives and more than enough to share amongst 4 people. . Next up were the burgers! I love the build your own with so many options.  They have a sheet that you mark with the type of burger (I go with the beef but also options for bison, chicken, veggie-which is really good for a veggie burger), then pick the bun and I enjoy the whole wheat option.  You then pick a rub for your burger-I went with the sweet onion this time.  Cheese is an extra dollar but they have lots of unique options. I choose the buffalo cheddar. Out of the veggie toppings you get to pick 4.  You can also add on almost anything from bacon to avocado for a small extra charge.  Then pick the sauce-I went the mustard-nothing too exciting. They burgers come with chips and for a small fee you can upgrade to other sides such a salad or fries. Write your name on the sheet, pick how you would like the burger done and turn it in.  The burgers come out cooked exactly how you like marked with your name in a pitchfork marker in the burger!",

Since it was late on a Monday night there was no wait and we were seated right away, which was great. The staff were friendly, helpful and took their time with us...but I don't know if thats because it wasn't so crowded.   The menu looked really interesting with plenty of options for finger foods, sides, burgers, and sandwiches. I would have liked to try more things but I HAD to order a spiked milkshake. I ordered the almond tort and it was SO GOOD. There was a ton of whip cream but I didn't think that was a bad thing. You could taste the liquor but it wasn't overpowering and I really enjoyed it. My friend got the non-alcohol nutella milkshake and that was delicious too.   For my burger I ordered the Jerk Chicken one. I would normally just get a regular beef burger but this just sounded very interesting to me. It had jerk seasoning, pineapple, banana ketchup, and other toppings on a whole wheat bun. It was messy but pretty good. I think next time I would go for a beef burger. There was the option of building your own burger, which my friends took advantage of. Their burgers looked delicious and they had nothing but good things to say.   I would go back and explore the menu a little better.",

They were advised of a 25 minutes wait, they took our number so they could text us and sent us on our way.  We got a table in the \"patio\" area.  Our server greeted us right away and I went straight for a Monkey business shake.  The shake wasn't very thick and I was surprised by the weird pieces of banana and the mountain of whipped creme.  But still, very yummy.  I am a fan of the build your own burger.  Loved their whole wheat buns.  My burger was very thick and perfectly cooked.  I got the angel dust and bourbon barbeque.  BJ got the Crab Shack.  Not exactly jumbo lump crab meat, it was very flavorful.  I really wanted to try the What-A-Jerk chicken burger, but was advised this isn't wasn't all white meat.  The only downside was the potato chips.  They were just taking up space on my plate.  We didn't like 'em.   We really liked it here and will visit again.",

    "text": "My trip to Burgatory got off on a bad start because we were given a 45-60 minutes wait for a table on a Monday night. And once you're way out in Timbuktu (the Water Works), it's not like you're going to change your mind and hop back in the car, so we wandered the soulless shopping plaza for at least 45 minutes before being given a table.   I understand a wait on a Friday or Saturday night, but on a Monday night? This place is clearly too popular for its own good. And needless to say, my stomach was growling with sky-high expectations by the time we sat down.   I love that the restaurant attempts to simplify the meat-ordering by asking you what color you want your meat to be (red, pink, slightly pink). But when I ask for pink, and I get brown, it's a lot worse than a misunderstanding of what \"medium-rare\" means. And that's my biggest gripe. Everyone at the table asked for different colors, and we all wound up with the same blah brown.    Aside from the actual burger cooked level, the shakes were lovely, the beer selection varied, and the toppings were outstanding. But if you claim to be a burger place, you have to do your burgers right. If I end up back there, I'll insist on \"RED\" but I won't go out of my way to wander around the Water Works aimlessly for another hour of my life when Tessaro's and Winghart's are closer and better.",

I like a restaurant that dictates their dishes and stands behind them 100%.  The spiked milkshakes were massive and pretty strong, but ridiculously sweet.   Don't get me wrong, the food and drinks were all fine and dandy, just didn't have that WOW-factor I look for when a place gets so much hype and rave. Also every time I went there was a 1-2 HOUR wait. WAY TOO RIDICULOUS. Too much effort in my opinion.   Rather go to BRGR for a closer, faster option. Same thing.",

I actually stopped my hubby from going a third time in a month because, as a dietitian, I don't think it'd be right if I became a regular at a burger joint!  Their burgers are definitely delicious. I'm taking off a star because I ordered mine medium (I like a little pink in the center) and mine came out overcooked. The second time I went I asked for mine medium rare, and I'd say it was a perfect medium. Although I'm not a huge fan of chips, their side of chips is a tasty accompaniment. We always order a side of fries as well. Also, their milkshakes are worth checking out!  I've tried the caramel pretzel milkshake and it was delicious! Never thought I'd like chunks of pretzel in my milkshake, but it created that perfect blend of salty and sweet. My only recommendation with the shakes is to pace yourself (or order it as a dessert). My hubby and I barely had room for our burgers!   Both times we went around 8pm on a Sunday night and had no issues getting seated right away. Service was great. Our first waiter actually remembered us the second time we came and stopped by our table to say hi (see why I couldn't go a third time?!). Don't be turned off by the location of Burgatory. Although it's in a strip mall setting, the inside atmosphere is completely different. All in all, Burgatory is definitely worth checking out if you're in the mood for a good burger and shake. I have no doubt that my husband is counting down the days until our next visit!",

    "text": "Ever since I learned to make Juicy Lucys, I haven't been tempted to try out the high-end burger joints like BRGR or Burgatory.  Doesn't paying $13 for a fancy schmancy wagyu burger seem akin to paying $100 for designer jeans?  Well, I actually have a couple of Lucky Brand Jeans, so let's get this review going!  I had a great meal!  A bucket of truffled gorgonzola fries?  Yes, please.  \"Unbelievable,\" was uttered.  The Meat Your Maker, a wagyu burger, was as advertised.  I was pretty skeptical of the Make Your Own Burger approach.  I thought it was a gimmick: No, sir, if I wanted to make my own burger, I would have stayed home! But, there are 5 to 12 options for meat, buns, cheeses, rubs, sauces, and condiments .  These are all high-end, gourmet condiments (e.g., Kona Rub, truffled shallot aoli, aged gruyere, avocado wasabi) and you can really create a fantastic burger to your liking.  I shared, reluctantly, the Nutella milkshake.  It is enough for two, and it was a great desert.  There's nothing like an old-school, new flavor milkshake.  So how many calories are we at now? 5000? No worries, I just took an extra Lipitor and Aspirin when I got home, after I popped the button on my Lucky Brand Jeans.  Burgatory exceeded BRGR in terms of tastiness, ease of parking (at the Waterworks Mall), kid-friendliness, and overall service.  If you're deciding where to go, choose Burgatory (Lipitor and Aspirin not included).",

The bar is also very contemporary and sits nicely in the restaurant.  The burgers? Good--but I have to report (sadly) that I was a bit underwhelmed. Perhaps it's because there has been so much hype about these places and from my friends that I thought that the burger would have just blown me away. I had a milkshake for desert. Spiked was a little too rich I thought.  Is it worth it? Sure, but not for a 30 minute plus wait. Come check it out for yourself!",

I got the new item the Elk burger, I 100% forget the name, and it was waaay better than expecting.  The gamey taste took me by surprise the first bite, but after a few more and the flavors hit my taste buds I gave in.  My buddy got the Meat you Maker burger and gave me a slice.  The Wagyu beef was delish!!! It literally melted in my mouth.    And of course we had to be glutons and get shakes to top it off.  I got the Caramel Pretzel, and the salty/sweet flavor really meshed well.  I loved the chunks of pretzel in it also, and the straws were big enough to not get clogged by them.  They were like mini tubes.  I liked the option to \"spike it\" and you can do it with any of the regular shakes, my girlfriend got the choco taco shake spiked and she loved it.  Needless to say it was the best burger I've had to date and i can't wait to go back.",

The chili was amazing, and I've never been really into that either before.  The S'mores shake was to die for, definitely above par from any I have gotten before (get the chocolate vodka in it! It's good with and without!)... And the service was fast, friendly, and attentive.  Best experience at a restaurant I've ever had.  Amazing.  Amazing. Amazing.

BRGR offers a pretty good burger, but it's not on the same level as Burgatory.  The burger itself was thick and juicy, and came cooked perfectly medium rare- something that's easier than you think to mess up as I've had numerous other places over or under cook mine.  I created my own burger instead of going with what's on the menu, but that wasn't because the menu didn't have things that really appealed to me- I just wanted to pick a bunch of my favorite toppings.  I went with applewood smoked bacon, crispy onion straws, and Gorgonzola cheese on my dry aged wagyu burger, and the toppings were a perfect match for the great burger.  Then I added one of their interesting alcoholic milkshakes, the Rice Krispie Treat one, and have to say that was also very impressive.  Even the decor gave you plenty to look at.  My trip had a long wait but it was well worth the wait and the slightly higher than average burger price to have the best burger experience of my life.",

    "text": "I wish you could give half stars, because I would give this 3 and a half stars.  But I'm bumping it up because it is MUCH better than BRGR AND because their shakes were phenomenal.  I went there with a few friends one evening for dinner.  It was a weekday, so we were surprised to find that the wait time was about an HOUR!  One nice thing they do here, though, is put you on the waitlist and then take your cell number -- and TEXT you when your table is ready.  I thought it was a nice way to get past those little pagers that more restaurants give you -- because you're not tied down to some small range.    We killed a little bit of time shopping while waiting to get our table and it made the wait a lot more manageable.  The decor of the restaurant is cool -- it is winter so they had their patio area screened in and they had these AWESOME fire-looking heaters.    Our server was very friendly and prompt with taking our order.  I tried the Espresso Love milkshake and my friends had the Monkey Business and the Guiness Float.  My milkshake had a great flavor, but I found the chucks of espresso beans to be a bit off-putting.  My friend LOVED her Monkey Business shake and was kind enough to let me try it -- and it was DELICIOUS.  Our other friend said the Guiness float was... interesting, but not his favorite.  The shakes were HUGE and came with a metal cup with \"overflow\" shake in it -- neither of us could finish the whole thing!  We ordered the truffled fries -- so tasty!  I think I am in love with truffles!  I probably ate a few too many fries because between those and my shake, I was nearly full by the time our burgers came.  Each got a burger.  A Morty's Steakhouse for me, Farmer Brown for my friend, and a custom burger for my other friend.  The burgers took a while to arrive, but overall were flavorful.  Not the best burgers I've ever had but they were solid.  Maybe it is partly because I was pretty full from the milkshake and the fries, though!  Us two girls couldn't finish our burgers and chips, but our guy friend did finish his. I agree with one of the other reviewers that it would have been nice to have more sweet potato chips.  I would even be willing to pay a bit extra for ALL sweet potato chips, but they are kind of an obsession for me.  Overall, a good burger, but I wouldn't personally drive out of my way for it when there is a GREAT burger joint close-by in the city.  I would def. meet friends there for a burger or stop in for one if I were in the area.",

Average burgers, nothing exciting and seriously lacking in flavor with a side of chips that could have chipped a tooth.  Based on the descriptions, it seems like they are trying. Just not succeeding. I ordered the What-A Jerk Chicken and hubby got the Morty's Steakhouse. Both sounded like they should have had flavor for days. I detected no jerk seasoning whatsoever on my chicken burger - which is actually ground chicken, not a chicken breast which was explained by our server before I ordered. The grilled pineapple was the only flavorful item on the bun, but unfortunately 1/2 of it was the hard inside core that you can't bite through. The whole wheat bun also started falling apart on my first bite and I didn't know there was banana ketchup on it until I reread the menu description afterward.  If I had ordered an actual burger would I feel differently? I tasted my husbands burger and other than the meat itself, it was equally flavorless. He was in total agreement. His was served with an enormous mound of onion straws that try as we might we couldn't find any onions, just fried squiggles of batter.  We went there for lunch, so we didn't try the shakes. Based on our burger experience, I'm guessing we won't be coming back for them.",

They have a selection of free toppings which you can put as many as you want, and they also have some paid toppings for 1-1.5 each. Each burger comes with crispy  Sweet & Russet Potato Chips. They stick a little fork through the burger with your  name on it.   I haven't tried their already made burgers, but apparently you get more for what you pay than the custom ones, but I always like choosing what goes in  my burger.  Most people also come for the shakes and they are HUGE. They not only give you a tall glass, but they give you a large silver cup with the extra milkshake that couldn't fit in the tall glass.   Definitely worth coming here. You'll leave fat and content. The only negative thing is the wait can be long since they don't do reservations, but they are accommodating enough.",

Why doesn't a burger joint toast or warm the buns?  Big miss in my book.  2.  Service is okay, but some of the servers seem a bit too proud to be working here, for some reason, like I, as a patron, am really lucky to finally get to eat here...  Not very becoming.  3.  The milkshakes have too many little chunks in them for me.  They're weird, and would be better if they were a bit more normal, a bit less cute.  4.  It's kind of pricy for what I get.  So it's certainly not bad, and overall, my burger was pretty tasty. They are a few, glaring misses away (well, four misses) from being really good, so I am pulling for them.",

    "text": "Burgatory is one of the better burgers in Pittsburgh, when cooked well. I've always gone the custom route which includes some variety of avacado, lettuce, tomatos, fried egg, grilled onions, and chipotle sour cream (which is no longer on the custom menu, but you can still order it). And I always get the black peppercorn rub. When I do have room for a shake, which isn't often, I really enjoy the peanut butter shake (fluffer nutter? I can't remember off the top of my head).  In comparison to other burger establishments in the area, they really lack on their sides. Chips are \"OK\" but always seem to be rock-hard and you usually only get 1 or 2 sweet potato chips. Fries are sub-par and try as I might, I do not like their \"organic\" side salad option.  Some of my bigger complaints is how they prepare your burger. It doesn't matter what temperature state you order your burger (pink, some pink, no pink), it ALWAYS comes in-between pink and some pink, which means blood soaking up in the bun. I was even advised to order \"no pink\" on my last visit, to which I did, and it still was almost rare.   And from a custom menu standpoint, I don't understand some of their pricing - the burger is certainly big, but $1.00 for grilled onions? Especially when they are just purple onions that have barely been sauteed, let alone caramelized.   Staff is hit or miss, and I won't forget the time their Twitter rep argued with me about an experience I had with slippery floors, odd as that sounds.",

    "text": "Yummy, yummy, yummy I got Burgatory in my tummy is what I was singing in my head my last trip here...  I should preface that this was the first time I have eaten in at Burgatory, as other attempts were halted due to extreme wait times.  In the past my office has ordered takeout from the Waterworks location.  The take-out was still yummy, but through transportation and whatnot the burger arrived pretty messed up.  So eating in is my preferred method.  Last time there was a real treat as I usually don't get to go out to eat for lunch due to time constraints and this chain they have on my leg attached to my desk, however I was in luck this day.  My Operations Manager was in town that week and asked if he could take me out to lunch to talk about some things.  I happily excepted and strongly suggested Burgatory, so off we went.    When we got there we didn't have to wait for a table, which is something I had yet to experience with other attempts to eat here.  Seated I looked at the menu and decided on the build your own burger...  I went with the Dry Aged Wagyu, on a wheat bun, with Diablo Dust, Smoked Gouda, Sriracha Remoulade (on the side) with lettuce tomato, onion, and jalapenos.  I like my burgers cooked medium rare, I think Burgatory cooks closer to rare in the middle but that doesn't bother me, but as a tip I would suggest most people would like it a little more cooked.  I on the other hand was extremely pleased.  The burger didn't take too long to come out so we spent the next 10-15 minutes in complete silence as we ate...  Oh so much better than takeout!  This is up there with one of the best burgers I've ever had, and since it's on the boss it was also the cheapest, meaning free.  Can't turn that down ever.  Can't wait until they finish their new location east of the city, 3 miles from me : )",

    "text": "Clearly a place with several hundred glowing reviews doesn't need another thumbs-upskie from me, but I'm going to give it one anyway.  I adore Burgatory. And it's weird that I would love a place called Burgatory, because I don't really eat any meat except for chicken. But the beauty of Burgatory is that they don't just cater to the traditional beef burger eaters. Their handy build-your-own option gives chicken and veggie lovers like me the ultimate burger freedom! Hooray!  My favorite combination as of late is a burger made with chicken breast dusted in cajun seasoning, topped with farmhouse cheddar, BBQ sauce, and onion straws. That's it. Very simple, yet so, so, so, so, so yummy. The ingredients that they use are so high-quality and fresh that you can really TASTE them. The farmhouse cheddar is perfectly sharp and tangy, the spice from the cajun coating on my chicken really pops, the BBQ is sweet and smokey, and the onion straws add a nice salty and crunchy bite. All of these flavors manage to simultaneously stand on their own while working in perfect harmony together. It's truly chicken sandwich bliss.  Of course, you can't have a helluva burger without balancing it out with a heavenly shake. And their shakes live up to their heavenly moniker. My favorite is the S'mores, with chocolate, micro-marshmallows, and tiny bits of crushed graham cracker throughout, topped with a giant toasted marshmallow. The salted nutella crunch shake is also amazing (though really, have you ever had anything with nutella that WASN'T amazing?!), and I love their specialty shakes too. Around Easter time they had a Peeps shake that was out of this world. Their shakes are huge and easily enough to put anyone into a diabetic coma, so split one with a friend (sharing is caring, after all).  The only thing I don't like about this place is their high-top table chairs. I know they're trying to go with the ultra-modern decor, but those high-top metal chairs are ridiculously uncomfortable. I'm a tall drink of water, and I just don't fit right on them...my legs dangle and there's no comfortable place to rest them. I just end up feeling like an overgrown toddler when I'm sitting on those chairs, I don't know why. It's quite odd.  This place does get really, really crowded, and not just during normal weekend dinner hours, but sometimes at completely random times as well (there was once a wait at 2:00 on a Tuesday, WTH?)  However, their wicked wait times have gotten a lot more manageable with the No Wait app. Click a place in line in the app, and they text you when your table is almost ready so you can start heading over. Unbelievably convenient, especially for me since I live within walking distance of this place. Now I can wait at home and just walk over when my table is ready instead of having to putter around outside the restaurant with a huge crowd. Fantastic!",

    "text": "The first time that my husband and I ate at this restaurant, we sat down, looked around, took a bite of our food, and determined that if we had ever created our own restaurant, it would be like Burgatory.  I had the opportunity of not only going to this restaurant a couple times but also going with a large group of people who are very open about passing food around for others to try. Needless to say, I've had the opportunity to try a lot of different things from the menu!  My favorite menu items? The Truffled Gorgonzola Pommes Frites were delicious and are a great item to share. Last time I went, I split the Farmer Brown burger - simple egg, ham, cheddar, lettuce and mayo burger - and could have definitely eaten more than half. Finally, most importantly --- THE SHAKES! My favorite is the Salted Nutella Crunch followed by the Caramel Pretzel and Espresso Love. I also enjoyed Grand-Dad's Secret because the bourbon flavor is very pronounced. Plus, even though a shake may be listed on the Classic menu, Burgatory will happily spike any shake for you.  Least favorite menu items? Really, only a salad (not sure which one) that my brother-in-law and his wife ordered. They said it was positively drenched in dressing and was practically inedible.   Not only the food but also the marketing impresses at Burgatory. I've worked in retail for the last six years, so how a retailer or restaurant attracts a consumer is always forefront in my mind. Burgatory has fantastic marketing covering the walls of the restaurant and on the tables. It's not the sort of place that you leave and can't remember a month later what the name of the restaurant was....  All that to say, I love Burgatory, would recommend it to anyone, and will be going back very soon!",

I had average expectations because of the hype that often puts a restaurant (or anything for that matter) in the predicament of having to live up to such heights, but Burgatory didn't let us - or itself - down! The hype is warranted, and this location is probably my favorite for it's smaller, warm vibe.  Great burgers, and dare I say, even better shakes! The service has typically been really good, and the quality has maintained it's consistency despite their slow, but steady openings of new locations.  I'm not going to dive too deep, as my write-up on the food experience was already noted on my review of their Robinson location (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/burgatory-pittsburgh-5?hrid=KHuofFy5VCPpXPv0FbZv4A\">yelp.com/biz/burgatory-p...</a>), and there's little difference, aside from restaurant size (the wait, food, and atmosphere are basically the exact same).  You might enter Burgatory, but your tastebuds won't be staying long...they're just a few sinful bites or sips away from \"heaven.\" Haha. Enjoy!",

    "text": "So this is one of the burger places that has seemed to get some buzz among a few other good burger focused restaurants around Pittsburgh (namely Brgr and Wingharts). So I just tried this place and had high expectations to go with the the great reviews that I have heard.   I love their text to be seated system, so we got to spend our wait shopping at TJ Maxx next door. We get seated in about 30 min, which was pretty good considering the time we went and the popularity of this place. We said that it would be OK to sit at one of the high-top tables. BIG MISTAKE. It's as if they ordered the stools for those tables online and never sat in them to test them out. I am definitely not a fussy person about seating, but these stools were so uncomfortable that it actually affected my dining experience. I would not eat there again if those chairs were the only seating availability and that made me drop a star.  Ok aside from the seating, the food was really good. Not the best burger in town, so I had to drop a star. I started with a side salad which was excellent. The greens were very tasty and it was topeed with sundried tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, sunflower seeds, fried onions and delicious vinaigrette. I got the Morty's Steakhouse burger because I wanted to try one of their creations, rather than the create-your-own option. It was very tasty, the meat and sauce combo went really well together. The homemade chips were tasty and I think they were better than the fries (that my brother got). My burger wasn't formed well, so the meat fell apart, which didn't affect taste too much (a bit more cooked in some parts), but it made for a much sloppier dinner.   All in all i liked this place and would go back again, as soon as the crick in my neck from those chairs goes away.",

    "text": "Wow, we finally got to try out this gourmet burger craze!  What an experience!  We went to Burgatory for a friend's birthday.  First things first, they don't take reservations, and if you go on the weekend, it is CROWDED.  We had a big group, so they told us to get there around 5:30, which we did, so we were able to get a table together.  The good news is, if you get there early, you get to take advantage of happy hour!  There are discounts on booze and appetizers up until 6pm, so hold off on putting your burger order in until you've had a snack first.  We got the nachos, which were huge and slightly overwhelming.  If I had to do it again, I'd ask for the chili on the side, because it kind of made the chips lose their crunch along the way.  But the flavor of the chili and guac was really good, and it was just the sogginess of the chips that took away from the dish.  When it comes to ordering your burger, you can choose from a number of pre-determined options on the menu, or you can do a 'build your own' from these sheets at the table.  You choose from a checklist the type of burger (and they've got a wide variety, from beef to chicken to veggie or crab), the type of 'rub', type of bun, and then pick from a list of cheeses, condiments, and toppings (some of which are free, and some of which cost).  Finally, you check off how you'd like to have the burger cooked, hand it over to your waiter, and anticipate the arrival of your burgerly beast.  I got a beef burger (hormone-free, woo woo) with mozzarella cheese, garlic mayo, onion straws, chives, and grilled mushrooms.  It was gigantic and delicious and pretty much the most perfect burger of recent memory.  All burgers come with a side of homemade seasoned potato chips, which were delicious as well.  The burger will be huge, so get ready for it.  After dinner, if you've got any room left, feel free to enjoy one of their many creative milkshakes.  As we had a birthday at the table, they sent over a birthday cake milkshake, which we passed around for everyone to sample.  It really tasted like birthday cake!  They also have a selection of 'adult' milkshakes with alcohol in them, but after my happy hour margarita, I was trying to stave off a food coma and stay awake!  Overall, the only thing we didn't like about Burgatory was the other patrons.  Yes, we were a large group, but we'd called ahead and done the process as the staff recommended, and we weren't just sitting around taking up tables after we were done eating.  Despite this, two middle-aged guys with attitudes thought it was appropriate to ask us questions like, \"When the f*ck are you guys going to leave your table?\"  So, you poor Burgatory servers, I assume you must have to put up with a parade of douchebags on a regular basis.  It was REALLY crowded, but we weren't the only large party there, and although our server made us feel super welcome, I felt a little awkward with some of the other customers.  So, that said, get there early, and plan to eat fast, if you don't want people eyeing you up the whole night :)  However, these burgers were meant to be savored, and it's probably worth a staredown from a jealous hungry  dude in order to make your burger last as long as you can.  Prices are quite reasonable: for two drinks, an appetizer, and two burgers, we paid less than $40.  I also can't say enough good things about how attentive and accurate our server was, attending to a table of 8 guests, plus his other parties.",

The next night I went with the Crabcake burger.  Unbelievably good.   Tasted like a True crabcake instead of filler and peppers.   Huge portions too.    Go with the Brioche bread, its a burgers best friend.   An hour wait on the weekends.

As for my burger, I decided to build my own: PCP-laced Bison cooked med-rare; topped with bacon, gorgonzola and roasted peppers.  It was excellent and all I could do was lament the fact that this place was not located downtown.  I cannot recall what my friends ordered, but perhaps worth noting that this was their 3rd or 4th trip.

    "text": "Full disclosure:  I love Tessaro's, they make a mean, mean burger, so when a friend suggested we go to Burgatory, I thought I would be disappointed.  I was not!  We ended up going late in the afternoon on Christmas Eve.  Despite the fact that the Steelers were playing, the place was only one-third full so we got in right away.  While the menu burgers all sounded great, I decided to do the \"meat your maker\".  I had the black peppercorn rub on ground sirloin topped with field greens, tomato, red onion, and cheddar with their homemade mayo.  You can choose three \"doneness\":  bloody, pink, and none.  I'm a medium-well girl so I just noted that on the little card you use when you create your own burger (since I didn't know if that fit into pink or none category).  The burger for me was done perfectly:  just enough pink in the middle and mega juicy.  The bun was freshly made and since they buttered it and then grilled it on the flatiron, it was similar to texas toast (yum).  The rub was a good complement to the meat, and the toppings were fresh and wonderful.  The burgers come with homemade chips, a mix of russet and sweet potato.  At first, I thought I'd spring for fries, but honestly the chips are really, really good:  lightly seasoned with a bit of pepper and sea salt and went well with the burger.  Service was prompt and efficient and she did a great job explaining the menu and all of the variations/options.  For what you get and the quality of the ingredients, the meal is quite affordable.  I (as it turned out wisely) thought that a milkshake and a burger would be too much.  I think the next time I go I'll split a milkshake with someone to have with my meal.  They all looked fantastic.  How does this compare to Tessaro's?  The burgers at Tessaro's are a tad bigger (maybe by a healthy ounce) and while the meat quality is similar.  You can taste the smokiness from Tessaro's wood fired grill.  However, Tessaro's does not use a rub, so you get a different flavor from a Burgatory burger which is a different taste, but to my pallet, just as good.  Tessaro's home fries edged out Burgatory's side of chips.  So the verdict for me is that Tessaro's is just a hair better--but Burgatory is also very, very good.",

    "text": "Tessaro's was closed yesterday so we were in search of an alternate place to grab a burger in spirit of the spring weather. Even though Burgatory was a 20 minute drive, we were on a mission for dinner.   The location of Burgatory is surprising - it is tucked inside an outdoor mall- so you wouldn't just stumble upon it. But when you walk in the decor is hip and trendy with black and red colors branding the spot. The waitress told us that the wait would be about 45 minutes if we wanted a table but luckily two chairs opened up at the bar.  The burgers we ordered were brilliant - one was custom made and the other which was mine was the buffaloed bison with a side of fries. My boyfriend took a bite of his burger and exclaimed \"holy s*%$ this is a good freakin' burger!\" and I more or less had the same feeling when I had mine (though the bison patty could have used a little bit more seasoning). Fries were delicious - no salt needed, and the sweet potato chips were devoured. Bartender was friendly and informative of our questions.  Yum. I want some more fries.",

It was good but I feel like their other burgers were probably better. It's basically a big crab cake made into a burger, so if this is your first time, try something else is my recommendation.  We were too full to try the shakes, but my friends and family won't stop telling me how good they are.",

Add a decent beer selection & the best onion rings I've ever had, and I'm sold. It can be crowded, especially on weekends, but I've never had a hard time finding a seat at the bar.  Probably the only reason to ever visit Waterworks Mall.",

    "text": "A friend recommended this for my Pittsburgh visit, and it sounded like the perfect Pittsburghy thing to have: luxurious burgers, luxurious shakes, crafty beers, gentrified and post-industrial. We were a group of 5, and we had to wait 90 minutes on a Saturday night - fair enough. They texted us when the table was ready, and in the meantime we could enjoy the fun and sights of Waterworks (well, Barnes & Noble and Bed, Bath and Beyond).   We shared 3 shakes (pretzel-caramel, PBJ, and s'mores) - all three magnificent towers of milkshaky perfection. My personal favorite was the pretzel-caramel, which was salty-sweet (also, caramel-salt is very hip right now with my local crowd, so I had that added bonus of feeling trendy... EVEN WHEN I EAT). I got the Farmer Brown burger. Despite the whole place feeling abundant, the portion wasn't overwhelming. Okay, after a fried tempura portobello mushroom (with delish peanut sauce), 3/5 of a shake and my salad, I couldn't finish Mr. Farmer Brown. But so be it! I'll just have to plan better next time. It was glorious.  Limited craft-ish beer selection - I wouldn't come here for that, but it was a good layover while we waited for our table. Overall: definitely returning here on my next trip to da burgh.",

    "text": "We simultaneously looked at each other, having just taken our first bite, eyes widened, and we said, \"we're never going to BRGR again!\"   You can build your own burger, ordering each component from a pre-printed sheet, kind of like ordering sushi. Choose a meat, a rub, a sauce, cheese, and toppings (some free, like organic greens; and some $1, like onion strings), and cooking temperature. Alternately, there's several pre made options available, including one I definitely plan on trying that's topped with an over easy egg.   We also ordered their Buffalo wings, and, of course, spiked shakes. Buffalo wings were great-- nice and crispy with a nicely spicy sauce. The spiked shakes might be where BRGR wins. I got the salted nutella shake, and added vanilla vodka. The shakes come topped with a *a lot* of home-made whipped cream, and there are big chunks of chocolate candy in the shake. Both of those things tasted good, but I wanted a smooth shake, and there was just too much whipped cream for my taste.   Also, on Saturdays they have exotic meat burgers, and they update their website each week so that you can know when you can get that Python burger you've been craving!",

They are huge and then crust does not fall off/ the onion doesn't all come out at once. I would come here any day and be pleased just getting the onion rings.

Our service was great; nice beer selection; and I'm a big fan of the menu: creative burger choices and other great options for us not-so-burger-lovin' people.  And the shakes? They require a three syllable da-a-amn.  I didn't have one to myself, but took a sip/spoonful of my date's Pittsburgh Strawberry Pretzel Salad shake and it was deeeelicious.  My sandwich was a juicy compilation of mushroom and melt-in-your-mouth gouda complemented with a really nice batch of seasoned (what IS that seasoning - I can't quite figure it out) fresh french fries.    The only sad part of my visit was that I neglected to take the red plastic pitch fork that held my sandwich together with me when I left.

But, gosh darnit, those shakes are killer!  I just had my second one today, the S'Mores, and it was beyond amazing...  They bring it to you with a huge seared marshmallow in a large 20oz glass, with a tin of the extra inside.  It's supersize American all the way, and I love it!  It's made with vanilla ice cream and chocolate liquor, with tiny graham cracker crumbs inside.  The first milkshake I had was the Almond Torte, which is made with Prantl's Burnt Almond Torte with vanilla vodka and amaretto.  I'd have to say this is a close call between which one is better.  Either or are gonna satisfy your sweet tooth.    Okay, so the burgers.  Still good.  Still a lot to decide on!  They give you a whole sheet of options to make your perfect burger.  Seriously, any way you've ever thought of making your burger, I'm sure you could get it here!  I always go with the whole wheat bun (to make myself feel better about that shake) and my only gripe is it falls apart as soon as you pick it up.  So I usually eat the burger with a fork.  I had come here when the place first opened and I wasn't too into the chips they server with the burger.  They were a little limp.  Now they're nice and crunchy, still with the mix of sweet potato and regular.    I just hope they bring a Burgatory closer to town...although that boozy milkshake will be calling for me!",

    "text": "In my opinion, nothing beats the combination of a perfectly grilled burger and a delicious milkshake.  It is truly the classic American meal, and a popular burger joint called Burgatory is bringing new life to that traditional combo.  This place backs up its slogan, Helluva Burger and Heavenly Shakes, by providing its customers with an array of burger choices and an inventory of creative and delicious shakes.  Though Burgatory is located the Waterworks Mall in Aspinwall, after dining here once, I came to the conclusion that it is definitely worth the forty minute trip.  One of the main themes of this burger joint is customization.  They do provide a burger list consisting of about eight premade arrangements, but to truly satisfy a craving, one can indulge in a completely custom burger creation.   The customization goes as deep as choosing the particular rub you want applied to your burger before it is thrown onto the grill top.  Also, choosing how well-done you want your burger cooked is as easy as picking a color from a crayon box: red, pink, or no pink.  For me, the decision to order a custom burger was easy; however, deciding what kind of creation I wanted to build was a much more time consuming process.    After staring at the vast variety of toppings and choices on the custom burger sheet for about ten minutes, I finally decided on my burger fate.  I chose to upgrade my meat to the dried, aged Wagyu beef.  Yes, the prime piece of Kobe beef totaled to a four dollar upcharge, but it was worth every penny.  I also concluded to top my burger with Amish Gorgonzola cheese, roasted red peppers, caramelized onions, sauteed onion, roasted tomatoes, and mixed greens.  Be careful when adding the gourmet toppings to your burger because they can make the price for your meal go up very fast.  The total price for my towering creation came to a whopping seventeen dollars.  Indeed, it may have been the most expensive burger I have ever eaten, but it was also the best.   My burger came delivered to my table with a pitchfork pierced through the center of it, and a piece of paper with my name on it was positioned between the prongs of the tiny, red weapon.  The burger was magnificent.  As I cut through the center of it, the juicy, red liquid from the medium rare beef oozed out all over my plate.  Packed between the two ends of the brioche bun was my perfectly cooked red piece of meat with all the fixings I had ordered: it was absolutely perfect.  My first bite of the burger made my brain signal to my mouth to go in for more, and before I knew it, my plate was empty, and my belly was full.  Although my stomach was already satisfied, my brain told me I wanted more.  I needed to order a milkshake.  The flavor options ranged wide from PB&J to a caramel pretzel blend.  I opted to make my decision easy and order the weekend special.  To go with the season of Valentine's Day, the crew was spinning a chocolate covered strawberry shake.  The pint glass full of deliciousness came topped with a massive serving of whipped creme, and the usual cherry on top was replaced by an artfully decorated chocolate covered strawberry.  Slurping up every last drip of the heavenly shake was the perfect way to end my flawless meal.  Burgatory takes the cliche fast-food slogan of \"Have It Your Way\" to a whole new level.  By combining mouthwatering menu items with a one-of-a-kind dining atmosphere, this place creates one hell of an experience that will have you coming back for more.  If you are in the mood to spoil you stomach and satisfy your sweet tooth, I would highly suggest venturing to try Burgatory's sinful spin on the American classic.",

For people who appreciate this, the Burgatory menu is a thing of beauty.   It's like sitting down with a skilled artist who has laid out all sorts of materials--oil paints, watercolors, pastels, charcoal, googly eyes--and you get to choose all of your favorites for them to create a masterpiece. Charcoal with deep red paint. Pastel pinks with glitter. Except, you know, this involves food, which is the actual best thing ever.  Caramelized onion marmalade, truffled shallot aioli, angel dust rub, cabernet sauce, bacon jam. Literally anyone can be made happy with meat choices including elk and bison, regular beef, chicken, crab (!?) and veggie burgers. Traditional white bun, whole wheat, or no bun at all--among other options.   If you're not up for trying to pair BBQ with sriracha and horseradish cream and just want food in your mouth stat, there are some predesigned burgers that are their own works of art. Help yourself to a Monet. And it's always possible to get a regular burger on a white bun with lettuce and tomato.   But then there are the shakes: s'mores, caramel pretzel, apple pancakes and bacon, Nutella crunch. Some are spiked. This arrangement is actually too ridiculously wonderful to exist, but there you go. Show up, eat beautiful things. Die happy.  \"I think everything in life is art. what you do. how you dress. the way you love someone, and how you talk. your smile and your personality. what you believe in, and all your dreams. the way you drink your tea. how you decorate your home. or party. your grocery list. the food you make. how your writing looks. and the way you feel. life is art.\" --h.b. carter",

    "text": "Wow.  I didn't think I would find such a great burger joint in Pittsburgh on my first try, but this place may end up being my favorite for the Burgh.  To start, I love the ambiance of this place.  I was skeptical parking in the strip mall, but the low lighting, dark atmosphere, and chic decorations transport you away to...well, Burgatory.  Our waiter was very nice and helpful in explaining some of the different options on the menu.  He didn't seem to mind at all that we were taking our time.  We started off with the Gorgonzola fries, which were awesome even without the yummy cheese.  They had the perfect crispiness if you ask me.  The Gorgonzola was delicious and complimented the fries well.  They were careful in making the dish not to put too much of the strong cheese over the fries.  Nicely balanced Burgatory (+1).  I ended up getting the \"Meat your Maker\" medium rare as per my waiter's recommendation.  Let me tell you, he was right.  This thing was awesome.  At first, I was a little disappointed--expecting the greasy goodness that I sometimes demand from my burger--but this one was different.  This one was...divinely refined.  All of the subtle flavors started to come to together and sing in sweet burger harmony.  The dry aged wagyu beef started the chorus with its sweet onion crust playing the harmony.  The beef alone had amazing flavor and texture.  It wasn't before long that the roasted tomatoes and Gruyere joined in the delicious melody.  Then, out of no where, the truffled shallot aioli burst on to my taste buds to steal the show.  It's like a choir of angelic burger fairies were dancing and singing on my tongue.    Ah yes, Burgatory, you have raised my bar on what I can expect out of a delicious, refined, perfectly conceptualized burger... I shall return.  Perhaps to raise my bar a bit higher ;-)",

    "text": "I stayed at Pittsburgh for 5 days, and one of my most memorable experiences was eating at Burgatory. When you look at the menu, you must start off with the shakes, and I will guarantee that you'll have a hard time deciding which one to get. They also have hard shakes with amazing descriptions, but sadly I am under 21 :( It didn't really matter because the salted nutella crunch (nutella with nestle crunch bars) was ridiculously addicting and I could have been happy at the restaurant just eating the shake.  However, this place is a burger joint so we obviously have to mention those too. You can either choose a burger from the menu or you can make your own by marking off on a paper menu the kind of meat, bun, rub, cheese, sauce, and toppings you want for your burger. You should try the truffled shallot aioli sauce and add avocados to your burger if you like them! The burgers were juicy and the beef was a perfect medium rare. Because there are so many toppings, they are stabilized with a mini pitchfork, which is so suitable because my whole meal was just really sinful. The burgers come with regular and sweet potato chips on the side but trust me and order the truffled gorgonzola fries to eat with your burger.   We didn't get our burgers for a long time, but my boyfriend and I didn't really notice since we were talking the whole time and were distracted by how good the shake was. It must have been over 45 minutes though, and the manager came out to apologize and reassure us that the burgers were coming right away. When we got our check, the prices of the burgers were subtracted from the total so we basically got them for free. I was floored by the manager's gesture and the great customer service.  I will definitely hit up Burgatory again when I return to Pittsburgh and get the chance to go.",

    "text": "Burgatory was one of the burger places on my list when we moved to Pittsburgh. We had heard pretty good things about his place. So far they have continued to live up to the hype.  My go-to burger is the grass-fed patty with Angel Dust, bunch of veggies, whole grain mustard, and bacon. Sometimes I go with a bun and sometimes bunless. Just about every time it is cooked perfectly. I really enjoy the Angel Dust. When I specify \"Pink\" interior, it is pink; not rare or well-done. They have a great set of toppings, including cucumber which I really like.  Their chips are very good, a mix of sweet potato and regular potato. Fries are pretty good if not overwhelming. I often get a field greens salad instead of fries or chips and it is a nice change of pace:  mixed greens with pickled tomatoes, shaved parmesan cheese, and pine nuts.   I generally don't get a shake, but my wife does. When I've tried one, each one has been very good. They have a small but well-thought out craft beer selection that seems to be rotated frequently.  There tends to be a long wait at any of their locations, so do yourself a favor and get the NoWait phone app. it lets you put yourself in-line for a table before you get there. Overall the interiors are basic but every server we've had has been terrific, particularly with our young daughter.  Burgatory is definitely in the top-3 of our Pittsburgh burger list.",

Then came the biggest, best onion rings ever. I cut one of the 5 rings into 8 bite size pieces of deliciousness. Finally my \"standard\" burger arrived and wasn't disappointed with this either. I was only able to finish half. Ended up taking the burger and leftover shake out the door with me.  My boyfriend had similar experience with s'mores shake and the bison burger.

    "text": "After months of waiting - I've finally gotten to experience Burgatory!!! IT waws so difficult to decide on a burger or create my own, but I ended up going with the Meat Your Maker burger. It was a dry-aged waygu burger with a sweet onion rub, roasted tomatoes, field greens, truffled shallot aioli, and smoked gouda. I swapped the gryuyere for the gouda. The burger was delicious! An amazing combination of flavors that all popped - especially the roasted tomatoes. I was a tiny bit disappointed because even though it was waygu, my burger was on the dry side....so I think it was slightly overcooked.   The hard shake I decided on was the Burnt Almond Torte and it made my eyes roll back in my head! Spiked with amaretto and vanilla vodka and swirled with chunks of Prantl's Bakery burnt almond torte. The shake was also topped with a dense whipped cream which held up candied almond slivers. As delicately as I could, I inhaled it!  The truffle-oil and gorgonzola fries are perfect! The truffle oil really stands out and the gorgonzola crumbled on top gives it that extra zing of flavor....a must try!",

    "text": "I ordered the make your own burger with chicken, gorgonzola, mixed greens and tomato on focaccia.  It was extremely filling and delicious!  My dining companion, who's not a vegetarian, ordered the veggie burger with farmhouse cheddar and told me it was excellent.  She's gluten-sensitive, so she appreciated the gluten-free bun option (which she took advantage of), as well as our waitress asking about the acceptability of small amounts of gluten in other items.  We ordered the gorgonzola truffle fries to split to go with our burgers, and they were a great accompaniment.  In addition to the burgers, we ordered the salted Nutella crunch shake (one of two shakes without gluten) and split it, which was the perfect amount for two people.  Although the burgers were great, the milkshake was the star of the show!  It was incredibly thick and creamy, and the salty and sweet flavors of the Nutella and Crunch bars melded together wonderfully.  There are so many interesting and creative milkshakes on the menu--I look forward to returning to try the others (without the gluten restriction :-) and figuring out my favorites.  (Sign up for the mailing list and they'll send you a free milkshake coupon for your birthday!)  Service was good, and we used the NoWait app to cut down on the time we had to wait to be seated.  Personally, I'm not a huge fan of the sports bar-like, strip mall atmosphere. For burgers, I found it on par with BRGR; Burgatory wins for milkshakes, and BRGR wins for atmosphere.  I can't comment on the beef burgers or doneness since I don't eat red meat. 4.5 stars.",

    "text": "Burgatory.  Some have crowned it as the best burger in Pittsburgh.  Four months living in Pgh, several visits to other Pgh burger joints, and a recent revisit to Burgatory, I might have to agree with this...at least for now.   Food (9.0/10) = They have several pre-designed burgers on their menu, but I always opt for the custom creations option.  Here's the recipe for the burger I always create.  I have named this burger \"Noah's Ark 2013\":  \"Noah's Ark 2013\" 1) Meat = \"Natural Bison\" ($11) - juicy, moist meat from an ungulate 2) Bun = Brioche - buttery, fluffy, absorbing any of the juices oozing from the meat, the aioli sauce, and velvety egg yolk 3) Rub = \"Angel Dust\" (salt, pepper, garlic) - I keep some aspects of my burger basic, while others aspects with some jazz 4) Cheese = Aged Gruyere ($1.50) - a cheese with an essence of nuts. 5) Sauce = Truffled shallot aioli - genius; this is a life hack; GG no re 1337 6) Toppings (cost extra $) = Caged-free egg ($1.50), Applewood bacon ($1.50) - why have one animal in between two pieces of brioche, when you can have three?  My brioche is like Noah's ark, and I am like Noah ushering the animals inside it. 7) Other Toppings (no extra cost) = Arugula, cucumber - natural pepper essence of the arugula, with the refreshing crisp of a cucumber.  Here I provide the green grass for my animals to lay on inside my \"ark\"  The burgers come with warm potato chips.  Chips are not my thing.  But does one really come to Burgatory with prime focus on the chips?    Appetizer menu: Truffled Gorgonzola Pommes Frites = $6.50 = pretty good fries. Definitely taste the truffle flavor.    Shake: Grand-dad's Secret = $8.00 = bourbon, caramel, vanilla ice cream; thick richness of the caramel and creamy vanilla; bourbon...yea bourbon!  Other: Veggie Burger = Came with a vegetarian friend once.  She said it was the best veggie burger she's had.  Never tried it myself, but maybe this might give those who abstain from animal meat a reason to go to a placed called Burgatory.  Beer: great list of bottled and draft beers.  I would've subtracted one star from this Yelp review of Burgatory, if I couldn't pair my burger with beer.     Service (9.0/10) = Service has always been great.  Always attentive.   Ambiance (8.0/10) = cool set-up for everyone.  Booths, tables, tables outside, and a bar with several flat screens.  A place for the family.  A place for the kids.  A place for a close group of friends.  A place for those who want to enjoy an American meal while watching sports.  Overall opinion = So far...yes the best burger in Pgh.  This place is more of a 4.25 star place to me, rather than 5.   It just hasn't blown my mind away, like the other restaurants that have received 5 stars from me.  Maybe it will blow yours away.  Make your judgement.  Judgement day.  Judgement day at Burgatory.  Be like Noah.  Be Noah.  Build \"Noah's Ark 2013.\"  Note, this place is usually crowded and requires patience to get seated.  Not sure if you can make reservations.",

I have a feeling that people either love it and are regulars or tend to visit once and find it a little overrated.   I had no complaints with my burger, except that they forgot to put something that I ordered on my burger (you can custom-order a burger by filling out a paper scorecard in the center of your table) and I was too timid to mention it to my waiter. I would return here, it's also conveniently located by the cinema, with a little walkway that cuts through the strip mall, so if carefully scheduled, dinner here and then a movie would be a good night out.",

    "text": "I remember once upon a time--about, oh, five years ago--when I lived in a typical New England college town.  A few months before I graduated, the most fabulous, incredible, mind-blowing restaurant showed up (or at least the most fabulous, incredible, mind-blowing restaurant since the cookie-&-doughnut delivery place Sugar Jones).  It was aptly called Fatso's, the premise was custom-built burgers & fries (and oh, the fries...), & it forever ruined me by giving me the ultimate discriminating veggie-burger palate.  No more bland TVP patties for me.  I demand the best. Thanks to Fatso's, every single veggie burger I've tried in the 'Burgh has been a disappointment.  D's is good, but not great.  Double Wide: consistently a letdown.  Even Quiet Storm couldn't cut it for me.  But Burgatory rocked.  My.  World.  Maybe it was the two half-price drafts I downed in 30 minutes to take advantage of the awesome happy hour special ($3.00 Rogue!!!!!).  Maybe it was the mere thought of the grilled mushrooms & fried egg on my burger to come.  But after one bite, I was smitten.  Well-textured with added flavor from nuts, balanced spices, & the fantastic grain mustard & garlic mayo topping my roll, this veggie burger now holds a special place in my heart as my favorite. All in all, great veggie burger, great happy hour, good shakes, & leaps and bounds better than the other restaurants (Fuel & Fuddle, Uncle Sam's, Joe Mama's) owned by the same purveyors.",

We came with nine people and all shared a bunch of appetizers and then moved on to our own burgers.   Appetizers We tried the onion rings, sriracha wings and bangkok steak fries (made of mushrooms). The bangkok fries were awesome, big juicy slices of portobella mushrooms served with a peanut sauce. These were fried but not heavy and just awesome. The onion rings rocked my world. These were obviously sliced in house, fresh fried and served with two great sauces. The peppercorn cream was my favorite and I saved it to dip my chips into later. The wings had just a bit of spice, despite the name. There was a nice sweet note in the sauce.   Burgers I had the Farmer Brown, a burger with ham, egg, cheddar and lettuce. The meat was juicy and well seasoned. The toppings all melded together well. It was quite a burger. The next time that I go, I want to build my own. They have these cute menu tablets on the tables with pencils where you can build your own burgers. It looks like so much fun!   My mom got the What a Jerk Chicken burger. It was super yummy. The banana ketchup was surprisingly good. I wasn't sure it would be my things, but soooo good. The cilantro on the sandwich made it sing!!",

It had a bit of heat, but not so much that the crab was lost. There was something slightly sweet going on with the creamy coleslaw that worked very well with the remoulade. I can't really recall the roll, but that is a good thing. It didn't overpower the filling of the sandwich and it was soft.   Also a \"yea!\" for the nice wine pours.

Customize your own burger of you want - and there are A LOT of ways to customize. All natural hormone free beef, organic bison available. Awesome beer menu, too! The location is the worst thing about this, but as someone who came from the south hills, I'll splurge on the gas to make it back.",

The create your own burger allows you to experiment with different combinations and ultimately allows the customer to never get the same thing twice. The pre-designed burgers are also good for the indecisive and the salads are also tasty. But you can't go to Burgatory without getting one of their creative shakes, but I suggest getting it to go as a treat for later.",

Were told a 45 minute wait so we roamed around the shopping area until they texted us our table was ready. I think that's so awesome and love when restaurants text or call you so you can walk around.  We were seated and our waitress came over to grab drinks. It was difficult for her to hear us a lot of time as it was really loud in there! We had a few create your own burgers that everyone seemed to enjoy. I ordered the Buffaloed Bison burger which was good and was my first experience with Bison. I liked it a lot and the ranch as the sauce was wonderful. My boyfriend got the Farmer Brown with ham and a dippy egg on top. He was in love! We both substituted fries instead of chips and they were crispy and had herbs on them. For the shakes, the table ordered 2 Peppermint Pattie, 2 Espresso Love, 1 Monkey Business and 1 Apple Pancake Bacon.  I loved my Peppermint Pattie, it was delicious and I was the only one who sipped mine casually throughout the meal. Everyone else ordered them as dessert and couldn't finish theirs they were so full.  I didn't like the apple bacon milkshake, something about the apple flavor did not do it for me.  The Monkey Business was too rummy for my boyfriend but I thought it tasted pretty good. The Espresso shake was a hit as well. We had a great time, expect a wait, grab a drink at the bar, and be prepared to loosen your belt.",

The burgers come with homemade chips but I opt for the sweet potato fries. Although known for their burgers, they also have nachos, salads, soups, and more.   Burgatory is also know for their shakes. You can get shakes even made with alcohol. The non-alcoholic shakes are only $6 and they have a bunch of different flavors with a rotating weekly shake flavor.   On this visit, Burgatory was having an Apple Pie shake. I was leaving the area and once I found out, I turned back around just to go get it. I ordered my shake and asked for the leftover shake they usually give you when dining in. I've asked for this several times before. However, thus time I was told that the to-go cup is larger than the dine-in cup. I said, ok and didn't press the issue. However the bartender didn't seem that interested in providing service. I was sitting there ready to pay but she kept her back to me and cleaned cups until my shake came. She also never asked my mother if she wanted to order anything. This isn't my normal experience there but I was disappointed.   I still enjoy Burgatory and would come back, but this definitely put a damper on my experience with the restaurant.",

    "text": "4.5 stars! This place is super awesome and I was glad I decided to check this place out on my last night during my recent Pittsburgh trip. The place was slightly further away from Shadyside but it's worth a dive. It's located a mall area, so the good part is, you can always find a parking spot! I love that they serve high quality of both milkshakes (they even have spiked options if you want some alcohols in them!) and burgers and their atmosphere and service were both superb. Both my SO and I REALLY enjoyed our meals and experiences there there.  My SO ordered a Caramel Pretzel shake and I ordered the Salted Nutella Crunch shake ($6 ea). I actually tried my SO shake, in addition to finishing my own, so I can attest to the fact that you can't go wrong with any choices you made! I felt like the flavors that they offered are interesting and were so well balanced that no matter what you choose, you simply are just going to enjoy them anyways. I also appreciate that they bring the extra portion that they couldn't fill into your milkshake glass for you to finish, too! :D~~~ I was happy that they didn't throw that away...because that would be such a waste!  I ordered the Piggy Butter Jelly burger because I thought their ingredients (like candied bacon and habanero jam) sounded interesting. I  was pleasantly surprised how well they went together. I forgot what my SO had, but ...at the end..we both finished our meals completely as well. I think that showed how well we loved our meals here.  Another thing to like is that the atmosphere of this place was great. It had a good energy, lively vibe to it. We stopped by this place around 9pm and it was still crowded! The service was great, too. The waitress brought out one wrong ingredient in the burger for the table next to us. When the customer informed the waittress about the mistake, she graciously took the comment, promptly apologized...and within the next few minutes, the restaurant manager came out with the correct ingredient/new burger to personally apologize to the table! :) So, yea, I was impressed. I get it that mistakes can be made..but how they handled it..was really professional! :)  Next time I'm in Pittsburgh or if anyone asks for recommendation for a good, fun or for a burger place, Burgatory would be my answer!",

I ordered the hard Espresso shake ($8.50) at 11:00 in the morning because I wanted to try it.  The shake was quite good.  It wasn't an overpowering amount of alcohol, nor negligent.  If you do order a shake, they are large, and you will want to be prepared to take some burger home with you.  I tested out a fairly standard burger.  I ordered a Standard Deluxe Burger ($9.50), which came on a Brioche Bun with Smoked Gouda, Lettuce, Tomato, and House Sauce.  The burger wasn't overly memorable but tasted good.  Is it worth waiting hours in line to eat at Burgatory?  Absolutely not.  But if you want a quality burger and the wait isn't too bad, check it out.",

    "text": "I love that Pittsburgh has so many local burger joints that all boast having the best burgers in the city. However, I was only visiting town for a short trip so I knew I'd only get the chance to try one burger place during my stay. The general consensus on Yelp was that Burgatory was the place to go, so that's where I decided to check out.   The best thing about my meal at Burgatory was hands-down the milkshake. I ordered the Grand-Dad's Secret which contained Old Grand-Dad bourbon with caramel and vanilla ice cream. This was easily the best alcoholic milk shake I've ever had. Generally, hard shakes try to hide the alcohol from the drinker. That was not the case here. The bourbon was front and center and the ice cream acted as the perfect chaser to the initial strong taste of the whiskey. I'd highly recommend the shake.   The burger was less impressive. I ordered Morty's Steakhouse burger. While I think the burger did indeed live up to the description of being a \"steak dinner reincarnated as a burger\", the burger itself was pretty dry, especially considering that I requested it to be cooked to medium. On the plus side, the burger was well-seasoned and was nicely complemented by the onions and cheddar cheese. I thought the burger could have used more of the Cabernet sauce to provide some more sweetness and acidity. While the burger was really good, I have my doubts about it truly being the best burger in Pittsburgh.   For my side, I had the mix of sweet and Russet potato chips. There was nothing really special about these, and I'm not a fan of having chips over fries.   The service was not that great either. We spent a long time waiting for our burgers, and the restaurant wasn't very crowded.   Overall, I enjoyed eating at Burgatory but I think I'll try a different burger place next time I'm in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "This was my second trip to Burgatory, after falling head over heels in love with this place during my first visit. Second trip? I'm still loving Burgatory!   My friends and I decided to make this place our dinner stop recently. Most of us had been to a Burgatory before, so we had a pretty good idea of what to expect. The four of us were seated immediately. Much to our surprise, It wasn't very busy in the restaurant. We all fully expected it to be packed.   Once seated we immediately reached for the create-your-own-burger forms. Because what's better than creating your own burger? I really enjoy all the options. For my burger creation, I choose the \"fiddy-fiddy\" burger (half beef, half pork) on a brioche bun, with angel dust rub, topped with farmhouse cheddar, roasted garlic mayo, organic field greens, bread & butter pickles, and slicked red onion. It was super tasty! To be completely honest, I don't think there is such a thing as a 'bad' burger here. My friend created a wild crab burger with diablo dust and he raved about it. I was going to order a shake, but my burger left me so full I couldn't bear to think about consuming anything else.   So after having a delicious meal, you might be asking yourself, 'so why only a 4 star rating?' Truth be told, I had to give only a 4 star rating because our server wasn't all that great. She checked on us very few times. It seemed as though she was constantly reaching over or in front of one of us. The most awkward part was there was never an excuse me or pardon me. Overall just really awkward.   Besides the server, it was a delicious dinner! I'm very much looking forward to my next trip to Burgatory.",

And after an overeating type of holiday I figured my food coma was driven by leftover turkey and the massive milkshake I got here.  So my plan of attack for my second visit was to have a light breakfast and steer clear of the delivious milkshake options.  The first part of the plan was followed, what happened after I blame on the restaurant.    We sat at the bar and got some really good drinks.  Mine was the Deuces Wild Lemonade.  Incredibly refreshing and had that nice good kick to it (this means it was nice and strong). After a nice short wait we were seated at a booth.  I was on cocktail #2 at that point.  Our server was Sara(h?) and she was really good.  Very friendly and had some good reccs.  We had to kids with us and she was helpful with them too.  I had the Morty's Steakhouse Burger and it was really good.  After another cocktail, our meal was complete.... oh except one of the kids did not finish their shake.  Guess who had some of it.... yup.  Needless to say the rest of the day was pleasantly unproductive.  Yeah that's a good description for it.    Seriously... next time I won't get a shake.

    "text": "Burgatory has become one of those places where I take my friends when they come to Pittsburgh from out of town. Wow. That list is selective and Burgatory made it. Organically. They deserve it.   My recommendation: Make your own burger. They have a completely customizable burger option where you can choose everything from the meat to the bun (or the lack thereof!) to the cheese to the rub to the toppings you want on it! Also, if you have room in the inn, try a milkshake. They're all good. I mean, you have to get a milkshake, right?  The quality of these burgers is great. It's like BRGR except better and cheaper (I said it). Every once in a while they have gotten my medium, medium-well . . . But no harm.  Burgatory is set on making that burger right.   Decor inside is awesome. This restaurant was actually ahead of that design curve when they first opened in this location (what a glorious day). I respect them for that. They have this cool garage area where the windows open to the outside. There are also many Tvs lining the walls to watch any game you care to see. It's great for a night out with your lady (or fellow), your friends, or kids. Versatility like that is hard to come by.   Do your tastebuds a favor and eat a dang good burger from the place made famous preparing what it claims to make best . . . Burgatory.",

    "text": "I ordered a custom beef burger with \"No Pink.\" The burger shown in the attached photo is what I received. Unquestionably, bright pink.   I called the waitress over and told her about the error. She told me they could take my current burger and throw it back on the grill or they could make me a new burger. I asked for a new burger because I had already cut into the other one and it was covered in messy toppings. About 5 minutes later, the manager comes over to the table and apologizes for the burger being \"slightly pink\" and informs me that my new burger will take 17-20 minutes to make, which totally threw me off guard. The waitress never mentioned the ridiculous amount of time it would take to make the new burger - if she had I would have just thrown the old one on the grill.  My husband had already received his meal at that point, so I asked the  manager if there was any way to cook the burger faster than 20 minutes (considering there was no one waiting to sit down and several tables in the restaurant were empty). The manager told me she could \"fly\" the burger, but it might not have all the toppings that I originally asked for - basically, I wouldn't get what I ordered for the second time.  My husband had cleaned his plate by the time I received mine and I was forced to ask for it in a To-Go box because we had somewhere to be. The restaurant comped my burger, but the experience was so frustrating.",

    "text": "This is the location where I was introduced to Burgatory a few years ago and I've been back many times.  I've been here for no wait and close to 2 1/2 hour waits.  I was skeptical at first when I heard those wait times but after that first experience I was sold. If you have a wait, go next door to Barnes&Noble to hangout. If you don't like waits, maybe try a different location as this one is pretty small. Or you can try sitting at the bar. It's first come first serve.  They have a pretty decent craft beer selection.  I've had several specialty burgers like alligator and duck but typically build my own with either Wagyu or Bison.  I love the Diablo rub, onion straws and horseradish cheddar. Those typically find their way onto my burger but I'm always switching it up. My advice is don't overload it because then you miss out on flavors. 4-5 toppings aside from your cheese and rub is probably good.  The fries can be hit or miss sometimes but I typically get a side of Sriracha Romulade to dip them in. The Chips that come free with the burger are excellent!  The Jalapeno Cornbread is a must try! Just make sure they warm the butter for you.  I normally get a shake to go (I can't eat a burger, fries, cornbread and shake in one sitting...I tried once and was miserable after)and really like the Fluffer Nutter Butter. You can always ask what their special is. I've had a few hard shakes and like Gran-Dad's Secret.  I was disappointed my last visit to find that they got rid of banana ketchup and Bangkok Steak Fries. They were both 2 of my favorites but didn't see them on the menu anymore. The waitress suggest I try the honey habanero sauce instead and it was pretty good. But those Bangkok Steak Fries and Thai peanut sauce were to die for!  Most of the time the staff is quick, attentive and friendly but like anywhere, sometimes you get a bad one. I've never had a major problem at this location. Not enough that it ruined my experience and I wanted to complain at least.  It's always been clean and looks well taken care of.  This place isn't cheap if you go all out.  You might have to wait a decent amount of time for a seat. If either of these two things turns you off then save yourself the frustration.  If you want a truly unique experience with gourmet burgers then do yourself a solid and get to a Burgatory right now! It is my #1 place to get a burger these days!",

    "text": "I love burgers. Love them. I've had them all over the US and the world! From  Alaska and California to prime cattle country in Alberta to the american heartland and NYC and beyond. Had them in Asia, South America, Latin America, all over Europe, Africa and Mexico (don't ever recommend them there). In fact, if I can be so bold, I'm gonna lay claim to being a burger EXPERT. So when I hear about how great Burgatory is, I'm intrigued.  And when I go to a place like this, I'm ordering burgers -not exotic milkshakes or truffle fries or some distraction. Nope. Gimme the burger.   Now, with that said, these are just not that good. I know, you're appalled. But Gary, you say, how can that be? Look at all the rave reviews!! Here's a clue. Check the reviews more closely and you'll note that people mostly rave about the spectacular shakes, not the burgers. And I'm just not interested in shakes - pretty much anytime.   Sure the menu is cool, build your own or pre made options like the  Morty's steakhouse I ordered or even the jerk chicken one my wife ordered. The beef is a \"succulent blend\" of angus sirloin, brisket and short rib. Sounds like it should be full of flavor. Sadly it's not. In fact it was uniquely bland and uninspired. Morty's says it has horseradish cheddar ( no evidence), Cabernet sauce (no evidence) and onion straws. Tons of straws but I couldn't detect an onion particle in any of them. So I'm profoundly disappointed. My wife's burger was equally tasteless. There are far better burger options throughout the city. I suggest going elsewhere. Unless you want a shake.",

You can create your own burger - tons of toppings and options. Chips are yummy but definitely need ranch or something to dip in.  Tip: order your milkshake half way through your meal because they take a little while.  Cons: The music was really loud. Our waiter smelled heavy of smoke, was awkward & barely checked on our table. God forbid we had needed something because he never came back after he dropped off our plates. Charged me for a side of ranch. We ordered one of the burgers with Brie, but when it came it didn't cover the entire burger. If you're going to change $1.50 extra - make it worth it.",

    "text": "This place is amazing. They start out by using the nowait app which allows them to text you when your table is ready, so you don't have to stand there in the restaurant waiting, you can go shop around the plaza. It is a nice change of pace.   One suggestion I make is if you are going to get the Shakes, share with someone else because a shake and a burger from here is just TOO much. SO DELICIOUS though.   I typically make my own --- but the last time I was there I had the crab cake sandwich and it was, I'm fairly certain, the best crab cake sandwich I have ever tasted.   They have a different list of beers on draft when you're there so that's always fun. They recommend asking the waiter, but when a friend of mine asked the waiter what the sangria tasted like her response was \"idk, i'm not 21 so i cant drink it\" as if that was somehow our fault. Tip to any waiter or waitress, if you don't know... find out the answer, because it caused my friend to then not order a drink and just get the standard free water. It was a very rude way to handle the question. Our waitress was not polite and when we were ready to free up the table and move to the bar to finish watching the hockey game, she was nowhere to be found.  (I'll tell you, though, this isn't the typical service I get at this restaurant, the wait staff is usually VERY VERY helpful and friendly).   Their onion rings are to die for. They used to have a buffalo chicken dip that was really good too -- though I didn't see it on the menu when I was there last.   Overall- you won't be disappointed. The atmosphere is just like any other bar-type restaurant. Everything on the menu is delicious, I've been with multiple different people and have never heard a bad thing about it. Give it a try!",

If you want a generic burger theres plenty of so so places around.   Everytime I go to Burgatory I do a build your own burger. I highly recommend going with bison as your meat choice. They cook it medium and it is so tender and delicious. As an fyi, my bf always get the standard beef and raves about it as well. I love the bayou cajun rub because it gives it an almost blackened flavor. I have tried several of the different unique flavors and the horseradish cheddar is my favorite. The whole grain mustard and spicy ketchup are great twists on your basic mustard and ketchup. There are tons of toppings to choose from as well!  The homemade chips on the side are a mix of regular and sweet potato. I dont even like sweet potatoes and I eat these chips. The service is great and ambiance is neat. We have also ordered to go and surprisingly, the quality remains even taking it home!  Definitely a must try if you love burgers!",

    "text": "Since it opened, Burgatory has grown from an imaginative and delicious purveyor of patties to an absolutely stellar and complete burger-eating experience.  In fact, it's gotten to the point where this is the only burger joint in all of Allegheny County that I'd even consider going out of my way to visit (which I do quite frequently).  Earlier problems of inconsistent cooking seem to be well in the past, and the entire staff's obvious devotion to superior burgercraft is evident at every turn.  The waitstaff is friendly, helpful, and extremely knowledgeable.  Whether answering questions about the finer points of grilling a burger to specific temperatures or suggesting a milkshake pairing to best match your burger choice of the evening, even the most die-hard burger fanatics (such as myself) can feel that they're in very good hands.  My most recent visit was for my birthday, and our waitress Meredith provided better, friendlier and more enjoyable service than did the entire team at Le Bernardin during my last visit there (the #18 restaurant on the planet could learn a thing or two from Burgatory).  The burgers are likewise a grand achievement, and the stunning number of choices and possible combinations a diner can create makes the consistent quality of every ingredient and every burger preparation all the more impressive.  Burgatory honestly boasts the best array of build-a-burger options I've seen in a lifetime spent eating hundreds upon hundreds of burgers all over the state and country.  The selections of meats, buns, toppings, and sauces comprise an embarrassment of riches for the hungry imagination.  The rubs are especially imaginative, offering a unique way to enhance the flavor profile of any custom-creation.  The Burger of the Day (the B.O.D.) often highlights ingredients not normally on the menu.  Sundays tend to feature brunch burgers, while Saturdays are the day for off-menu meats (Wild Boar, Alligator, Elk...)--but they've been known to run out of the more popular Burgers of the Day, so go for lunch if you have your heart set on a particular patty (I learned that one the hard way a few weeks ago).  Their milkshakes are also worthy of note, but this review is getting long enough--and let's be honest, if you need a milkshake to talk you into visiting a burger place, you're probably not serious enough about your burgers to require Burgatory's special touch, so why don't you eat someplace else and shorten the waits for the rest of us.  It is only my geographic distance from this location, combined with passing concerns about my own longevity, which prevents me from eating here 5 or 6 times per week.",

They made us wait 2 hours, thinking it might be shorter time we gave it a chance. The staff is not friendly add they don't even have the Decency to give out snacks while you wait. With a pregnant wife and a 2 year old we waited because we wanted to have these amazing burgers yelp recommended. Yeh their average at the best.  2 hrs later when out seats were finally available we were seated. Our friends ordered the shakes before the burgers. I didn't because I wanted to eat the burger. In hindsight I should have orders the shake instead. The shakes have actual chunks in it. I tasted the shakes and they were nothing like I have had before... So the place should be called shakatory.  When the burgers finally arrived, they lacked flavor and substance. Mildly juicy. Again the standard was the 4 stars. Unfortunately the burgers disappointed. At least the meat burgers. Te chips sucked really bad. Don't be shamed into tying the fries it the chips.  If you want VEGE burger though... That's another story. The best place for a vege burger period.  Long story short for a meat burger place it's a flop. Try a 5 guys instead.",

With the NoWait app we were promptly seated (highly recommend using this app) The music wasn't too loud and we really appreciated that.

The manager, Kirstin, came out and let us know that the deep fried portobellos we ordered were gonna be a little delayed. She said the portobellos were on the house! That wasn't necessary but we really did appreciate it. Then Chris came out and said they forgot to give us one of our portobellos and gave it to us! WOW! At this point we were very blown away by the attentive and friendly staff. Thanks for an amazing dinner to Chris and Kristin!

I've had the bison and a regular burger there before (please get a fried egg on top). The place has good ambiance and is great for going with groups.  The one thing with a place that is so great is that you should be prepared to wait, close to an hour to an hour and half.  I always get the bourbon milkshake when I go there which is also quite tasty and filling.  Go with an empty stomach and leave happy",

But every time, despite what weird concoction I've created I am always happy with my burger.

Maybe because every time I visit, I experience a food coma and when I awake can't remember anything that happened while I was there...  The food here is great.  We like coming here because the husband is a big meat fan and their veggie burgers are homemade and fantastic, which I like.  I feel like I can't give a comprehensive review because I think I've only ever ordered \"create your own\" versions of the veggie burger!  All their shakes are amazing, but I was especially a fan of the vegan one they offered as a special a few weeks ago...keep 'em coming, even if it's just on veggie Tuesdays!

    "text": "I actually came here initially because they were doing a special cookie dough milkshake I heard about on the radio, where $1 of the proceeds from each milkshake sold went to a hockey program for underprivileged youth.  So, that tells you something about the restaurant's priorities!  The milkshake turned out to be absolutely decadent.  I've since gotten the caramel-and-pretzel milkshake too, and that was as amazing as the first one had been.  The fiance was very happy with his s'mores milkshake too.   But, this isn't a review of Shake-a-tory.    And the burgers absolutely live up to the hype.  Now, the fiance has had bad luck with \"build-your-own\" burgers here, but I have been gobsmacked by each and every burger I've ordered off of that menu, especially the big, juicy Morty's Steakhouse Burger.  Highly recommended!  Get the nachos...and the truffle fries...and the parmesan peppercorn fries...!!  It's True that there's a long wait, but it's worth it.  Go check out some books at the nearby Barnes & Noble, indulge your feminine side at the Bath & Body Works, or just sit at the bar.  The atmosphere and service are just right: there's not too much noise or distraction, but it's not so quiet you feel like everyone can hear your conversation; and the wait staff is attentive without being intrusive.  Seriously, I love it here.  It's a great casual dining option for the weekends.",

I had a chicken burger, which was perfectly cooked, and the organization of the toppings was excellent. The second visit was good but not as good; the burger just seemed rushed. It still tasted pretty good but was a little dry and toppings were added unevenly.  The shakes are delicious and come in large portions. I wasn't a big fan of the hard shakes, but that's probably personal preference.  The wait times can be kind of long, and afaik, you can't make reservations ahead of time.. I suggest you come in between traditional lunch and dinner times for the shortest wait. I came at around 4-5 pm and was seated fairly quickly.",

The menu is very creative but the execution is awful.  The steakhouse burger with the Haystack Onions came out with about 3 onions on it, hardly stacked which would have been fitting, welcome and delicious.  The Jerk Chicken burger seemed awesome with Banana Ketchup.  The ketchup was non-existent and the chicken tasted like it was rubbed in a think layer of nothing but nutmeg.  Even the accompanying chips or fries were underdone.  The Crab Shack burger which has Sriracha Remoulade tasted nothing of the flavor.  I agree with other reviewers that the menu is creative but if you don't get any of the flavors then it doesn't matter.  Service is ok, albeit I have only eaten at the bar.  The shakes are good and the beer selection being only micro brews is nice for the area.  I have been there a number of times and I for one just don't get it.  The only thing they have over BRGR is presentation.  I hate that BRGR serves the burger in a deep basket.  That's it.  The food is much better.",

The combinations of both meals probably took years off my life so I hope you appreciate the sacrifice I've made to finally settle the question, where is Pittsburgh's best burger?  The definitive answer is without question, burgatory!  It's food at burgatory is more creative, more freestyle, more flavorful, less greasy and just more fun!  All the quasi religion of burger branding is amusing and well thought out, the staff was extremely friendly, and you can choose from their amazing premade burgers, or assemble you're own from a virtually endless list of toppings.  All this is a nice contrast to Brgr which only offers a few premade burgers, and allows no customization or substitutions, all while charging a higher price tag for smaller portions.  I got the snookie italian burger with a PB&J shake, both were sinfully delicious, but surprisingly non-greasy.  Both their alcoholic and non-alcoholic shakes are truly creative and incredibly good.  For non-carnivores there are many vegetarian and fish burgers as well.  I love the style and attitude here, and they really give you a chance to have it your way!",

So after killing time they finally texted us that our table was ready, our server was excellent, very knowledgeable and curteous. We decided to get an appetizer of the Bangkok Steak Fries, which were actually tempura fried portebello mushrooms, they were excellent to say the least. I ordered the buffaloed byson burger and the wife ordered the phat patti's veggie burger. We received our meals pretty promptly and everything was what we expected, but I have got to say that in my opinion this place is a bit \"Over-hyped\", I mean don't get me wrong the food was good but maybe I just set my expectations a little bit too high.  Maybe next time we will go at a different time of the day when it isn't as busy, we would try it again but it won't be anytime soon as I know of alot of burger places that surpass Burgatory as a premier \"Gourmet\" burger joint.",

I give Burgatory an A for effort in that they definitely have some interesting choices with how to create a burger and their burgers are pretty good.  However, beers are overpriced and the wait is usually pretty long unless you can get there around 5-530 for dinner.  Plus it is in a strange location in a shopping center tucked back in a walkway area and it is a pain to get to if you are coming from town.  BRGR is very similar if you are in town and looking for a chic burger bar.",

    "text": "Positives: The burgers are truly awesome.  I loved mine. Where else can you order a bison burger with your choice of extremely weird toppings.  It was divine and the portion size was just right.  The shakes, made with their own ice cream and served with an industrial-sized straw are thick and completely off the hook!  Order the burnt almond torte shake and you won't be disappointed.    Negatives:  My husband, on the other hand, ordered the Burgatory version of a french dip and was extremely disappointed in the quantity of meat and the size of the sandwich--it was like ordering a sandwich and getting a child's portion of meat.  This menu item needs to be reconsidered.  Likewise, the inclusion of house-made potato chips with every meal.  The chips are nasty-- too thick, too hard and generally inedible.  I had requested sweet potato chips only and was told this was not an option because they mix them with the russets.  Honestly, they were so bad you couldn't tell which was which anyway.  The noise level in the place needs to be brought down.  Having a table conversation is like trying to make a phone call at a rock concert.  This can be easily remedied by turning down the volume on the speakers.  When you have to shout to place your order and the waitress still manages to flub because she heard inorrectly, it is a sign that something should be done.",

I had the farmer's burger and she the vegetarian. Hers was alright, mine was less so. The vegetarian was good, but lacked proper texture for a veggie burger. The farmer's burger, which has an over-easy egg on it, came out brown and not pink with an over-hard egg on top. It was just dry, thankfully I had a boozed up milkshake to wash it down with.  The service was great, if a little amusing, kept leaving our drinks at the bar for two minutes then apologizing profusely.

    "text": "I can totally get on board with the concept here, especially since snobby BRGR doesn't allow customization of their burgers at all. Burgatory, by contrast, embraces customization to the extreme with cute build-your-own sheets that you can fill out with a pencil. Gotta love that.  They have almost everything you could ever want on a burger (except brie...hint hint). Be careful not to get overzealous with your toppings though, or it will be impossible to eat. Just definitely add their truffle-shallot aioli because it's easily the best thing on that list. And they definitely put BRGR's fries to shame, although if you decide not to upgrade and stick with their homemade chips, you won't be disappointed either.  What you may be disappointed in is their idiotic doneness scale that goes by color. I like my burgers rare, so of course I circle \"Red.\" That usually gives me about a medium, a little less than medium if I'm lucky. I get that they're trying to be quirky, but there's a reason the current doneness scale exists--it allows customers to order their meat at a specific temperature, yielding consistent results no matter where they eat. Well, in theory anyway...we all know this isn't True in practice, so why does Burgatory feel the need to complicate things further by making us learn a new scale that, based on my experiences, doesn't even go as raw as I'd like? The always overcooked burgers are what makes this place not my favorite, but since you can cover them with a ridiculous amount of toppings, it's not the worst thing ever. And of course if you like your burgers medium to well done, you'll be happy.  The boozy milkshakes are pretty great, and again, way better than BRGR's. I love the Bacon-Apple-Pancake, but it's literally a meal in and of itself. I wouldn't attempt this with a burger and fries again, unless I had the sudden urge to go into cardiac arrest. The best thing to do is to come with a friend and split one of the shakes, that way you'll still have room for the real food!  So I know a lot of people are in love with Burgatory, but I'm not about to marry it. I'm already in a committed relationship with Winghart's, but I have to admit I'll sneak away for a hookup with Burgatory every once in a while. Shhh...don't tell!",

We both agreed the baked beans were spicy and had an odd vinegar taste, along with the slaw. The fries were tasty though.  Guess the next time if we chance it I understand that Wagu beef is the best.  In the end the bill was $29.50 for 2 burgers,1 f/f , coleslaw  and baked beans.

I got the cereal shake, which was really good.  However, I came for great food, not a milk shake.  He got a burger.  I don't remember which one.  It wasn't great, wasn't horrible.  In all reality it was not memorable.  I guess I would try it again, but only if someone else were to suggest it.  I will not be going out there again without some encouragement.",

    "text": "Gourmet burger places have been popping up around Pittsburgh for awhile now. Given the fact that I have heard great things about Burgatory, I figured it should be my first outing into the Pittsburgh's version of the fancy burger restaurant. Unfortunately, it was not worth the hype.  We went on a Saturday night, arrived at 730 and told we would have an hour and a half wait for a party of four. That's fine; given the restaurant's popularity a wait that long is to be expected. It gave the group time to peruse the menu and decide on our luxurious burgers before we were seated,hopefully getting the food out quickly. We drank at the crowded bar and talked as the Pittsburgh Pirates game played in the background on every TV. While understandable for a sports bar, I wish there was something else to watch or keep us occupied. Variety is the spice of life, as the saying goes.  We were finally seated at 9pm. The first order of business was to order hard shakes. I ordered the Monkey Business, while others ordered the Apple Pancakes & Bacon, Grand-dad's Secret, and the Peppermint Pattie. They weren't exceptional, but what put them over the edge into awful territory was the lack of description on the menu of their consistency. Shakes are traditionally thick and smooth ordeals. I believe they should reclassify the Apple Pancakes & Bacon and the Monkey Business as \"Chunky Shakes\" since they have chunks of bacon and banana, respectively, in every sip you take. If you don't want to be chewing vigorously after every swig, then you might want to go with one of the other milkshakes. The best of the four was the Grand-dad's Secret, but even then it was nothing to write home about.  As an appetizer we ordered the Fire Kissed Sriracha Wings. They were probably the best thing we had all night. You could taste the unique tang, but it wasn't overwhelming.  Finally, we get to the burgers. Oh the burgers. If you're going to make your namesake one food item, they better be damn good and Burgatory missed the mark. To be honest, most people probably go here for the create-your-own burger, but since we were in a hurry we decided to order some of the pre-made burgers off the menu. I figure, if you can't even get the burgers you have specially made correct, then why bother venturing further? I ordered the Buffalo Bison burger the meat was good, but wasn't cooked the way I ordered it (more on that later) and everything else about it was incredibly bland. The lettuce wasn't crisp and the buttermilk ranch dressing was so bland and didn't add anything  that it could have not even been on the burger. I've had better buffalo burgers at diners and dives. My fellow diners ordered the What-a-Jerk Chicken and the Morty's Steakhouse and were also not impressed. Seems to be a trend.  So, back to the fact that the burger wasn't the way I ordered it. The last nail in the coffin for Burgatory: the service was awful. Our waiter called to question almost every thing we ordered and we didn't even make changes to the menu items. If it isn't good as is, then why is it on your menu? The service was slow as molasses. The whole dinner took about an hour and a half to two hours. In that whole period of time the waiter never came back to fill up our water and would leave plates to stack up on the table. Plus, no one got their burger cooked the way they wanted it. All the burgers were well-done when we wanted them either rare or medium-rare. The one plus side (and the reason this is two stars instead of one) is that when my friend spilled his mostly empty beer he had been nursing from the bar, they gave him a new, free one. If only they could have kept that level of service and class throughout the dinner.  Burgatory isn't worth the wait or the struggle. You want a similar experience? Go to Eat n' Park and bring a flask.",

Great server - attractive, knowledgable, and personable. I love a drink and this place knows their stuff. (My reviews are super lackluster without my peppered swearing, but you'll deal.) Bison burger!!! Duh! Not exactly heart healthy but you can stick your toothbrush down your throat if you feel so inclined. Ginormous cookie? Creaming myself. Oh, and if you don't ask for Marie to serve you then don't exist. Eating at her boyfriend's place next, Meat and Potatz. Seriously worth waiting.

They are so ridiculously good.  BYOB-(Build your own burger?)-I had the veggie burger which was surprisingly super good! The only complaint I really had with it was it kind of fell apart-but flavor-wise I would get it again. I would definitely get the truffle aioli on whatever you order.   Don't bother ordering a salad-meh. The hub got a buffalo burger which was also just meh. Our friends ordered the regular hamburger patty and I would say that and the veggie burger were my favorites.   We didn't try any shakes because we were too full (wamp wamp). Beer was good, but I would pass on the mixed drinks-they were not anything special.",

They tell you that the fries aren't vegan...they make sure you don't have nut allergies...so why not inform people about your breads? To top it off after finding out that there are only two vegetarian breads, they are out of the vegan option (whole wheat) so I settled for the cheese bread...when I got my food there was bacon on my plate.

    "text": "This place is unique. A great collection of burgers, shakes, beers. The burger portions are large and filling. Burgers are said to be all natural and hormone free, and they come with some OK sweet and not-so-sweet chips. You can make your own burger, too. If burgers+shakes+beer is you sort of thing, this is a very good experience. Not a purgatory, but heaven for burger lovers... They have salads, small plates, and big plates, too.  We got two burgers: the veggie and the crab shack. Both were of good size. And, tasty. We were more than full after finishing everything and the fries. The crab shack was like a crab cake (a good one) inside a bun. I got the whole wheat bun, which was good. My gf's veggie burger was one of the juiciest veggie burgers I have had so far on earth. Goes well with the Paulaner in a bottle.   We had three minor-ish complaints. First, some of the chips were soggy. Second, our waitress was somewhat slow in reacting to our needs or recognizing that we might have some needs. This was not terrible, but delayed our second beer order for longer than it needed to be delayed. She was overall nice, though, when she attended to us; the place was packed on a Saturday afternoon. And, they forgot to call us after a table became available. No dealbreakers, but Burgatory can become closer to a Burger Heaven if they fix some of the service issues and make their chips more fresh.     The ambiance is more of a dim bar+restaurant mix, with dominant colors being black and red. There are many TV's, showing sports, around the bar. This place can get packed, so be prepared to wait.",

    "text": "The burgers at Burgatory are good - there, I said it. The shakes are usually pretty awesome. But I have to say that the service usually stinks (flippant server attitudes are the most oft-encountered problem), and the place seems to have been designed with college crowd in mind instead of the yuppie families the restaurant tends to attract. It's difficult to be seated at a booth in this place, but seats at hi-top tables are plentiful - not an ideal situation when one is dining with children, elderly adults, pregnant women or really anyone who's uncomfortable not being able to put their feet on the floor (Not to mention, who wants everyone in the restaurant to be able to stare at your crotch while you're trying to eat since it's much closer to eye level that way?)  The wait-list system used to be fairly generous when the place first opened - patrons were given 15-20 minutes (or maybe even more, I can't recall) to get back to the restaurant once they received a text that their tables were ready. Within the past few months, it was changed so that the limit was only 10 minutes. When my friend and I arrived back to claim our table, we were informed that our booth was \"gone\" because we had just missed the 10-minute cutoff were offered a hi-top table instead. Since we were both pregnant at the time, it goes without saying that we were frustrated and uncomfortable with the seating situation. If you're going to rely on neighboring stores to act as your waiting area, you need to anticipate that customers can't drop everything and run as soon as you summon them; they need time to check out first!  I was also disappointed on a recent visit to discover that they'd discontinued my favorite appetizer, a buffalo cheese dip. The waitress unceremoniously (and somewhat unprofessionally) informed me that they'd taken it off the menu because they were losing money on it during happy hour. I would have thought there'd be other solutions to that type of problem (a limited happy hour appetizer menu, for one) rather than eliminating a popular item altogether.",

They have really good burgers and even though it's becoming the \"it\" thing to do they have spiked shakes.   The difference between this place and other places that have burgers is that Burgatory does is right. Everything they do seems to have a purpose a place on their menu. They don't do things just for the sake of doing them or having them on the menu.  Their spiked shakes are awesome and the execution is really cool as well. The S'more shake has a giant toasted marshmallow on top, and likewise the Oreo shake has the biggest Oreo I have ever seen placed right on top.   Everything about their decor is right on point. If I had a cool burger joint this is exactly how I would have decorated it. I love everything about this place other than the sometimes long waits to get a table.",

At first, I thought maybe it's the kitschy name and overall concept.  I want to know why Burgatory? What does purgatory have to do with burgers?  What is the relationship?  And I don't really want to make a burger, I want a chef to combine great flavors that I didn't think of.  And lastly, I reallllly don't like the Red, pink, not pink options for doneness.  Why? Because this is food for dummies.  And in my case, food that made me feel awful within 30 minutes and had drive to a restroom.  It was partially my fault for ordering \"Red,\" but I want my burger to be medium rare like it was intended.  Real restaurants use the normal meat doneness chart used by every other restaurant, excluding the child menus.  Now let's talk about the meat.  The meat is simple and somewhat flavorful, but overall not full of taste in any way.  I know a great burger when I take the first bite,  this was not one.  Your burger is your calling card and this is your best effort?  Sadly, PIttsburgh has made great strides in food, but gourmet burger joints have not kept up.  BRGR and Meat and Potatoes have the only worthwhile burgers in the city.  (I've not been to Winghart's.)  The fries were slightly above average, but not great for a burger joint.  This is your Robin to the BurgerBatman.  And if Burgatory was a comic, it would be on the clearance rack.",

The atmosphere is great for going out with friends or family and getting chatty. The waitstaff is incredibly competent, and always willing to offer input and suggestions. The drinks are pricey, so I usually pass.  Now to the good stuff. The food is awesome.

This location is kind of weirdly placed in a strip mall, but the layout is nice and it has cool decor. It is a hip spot, and I like the design.  Each time I have visited the service has been great; the waiters check on you frequently and are attentive, but are not clingy or overbearing like some other locations. They also know a lot about the menu, so they are a great help.  The burgers are outstanding. The premade burgers are good, custom burgers are good, all  of them. They routinely have non-menu specials that are a great choice. All of the ingredients are top notch, from the bread and toppings to extras. I haven't had one I don't like.   The sides are good; the fries are especially good. Truffle and Gorgonzola fries will change your life. My only complaint is heat level; things marked as spicy are decidedly not so. The milkshakes are unbelievable; the Caramel Pretzel and the Coffee and Donuts are generously portioned with great, unique flavors.   I only have one real complaint: the wait. If you go on the night of a sporting event it is a wait; if you go on Friday or Saturday night, expect a 2 hour wait. There are cool places to shop at nearby, but the wait can get onerous. But with good food, that is bound to happen.",

They mess up the take out orders quite often now, especially when it comes to getting the correct side, and not to mention they are usually lukewarm or cold. The last experience I had in the restaurant was easily the worst. The waiter barely paid attention to our table, and that was problematic because my vegan burger was completely burnt. It was blackened on both sides. By the time they were able to redo the burger, everyone at my table was finished. I ate part of the burger and tried the get a box for the salad I paid extra for, since I was the only one left eating, and after getting a hold of the waiter and asking for a box, he never came back to the table. He walked past our table several times tending to other tables, but I couldn't grab his attention. I left infuriated, without my salad and the leftover food I had just paid for.  I've also noticed they tend not to pay attention to you if it's just two people at the table and the servers tend not to know exactly what's in your food--something important when I order vegan friendly food. The bean side wasn't labeled that it contained meat, and the waitress (whom I told I was vegan) happily served me the beans. It wasn't until I dug in that I realized there was bacon in the beans--probably the furthest thing from vegan friendly.",

    "text": "Burgatory (greater than) BRGR (greater than)  Tessaros.   Yelp won't let me use the 'greater than' symbol. You get the picture. Seeing that I don't eat meat patties, ya'll can take that equation with a grain of salt based on strictly either pescatarian or veggie burger selections.   Burgatory was hands-down-in the top 3 of all-time-deliciousist veggie burgers ever. I did the \"Custom Creation\" with the sweet onion crust and it was a perfect, crunchy exterior and well-blended (not goopy or mushy) composition. The whole wheat bun was pretty fantastic too. I typically remove half of my bun (the top part, for those of you curious). This is due to the \"Bun to Meat Ratio Dilemma\".   Truth Bomb: Inner fat kid could eat the truffled shallot aioli on anything   We tried (clean plate clubbed) the Six-Napkin Nachos to start. The chicken chili on top was pretty awesome. They do the chicken chili by the cup/bowl, which I can imagine would be perfect on a cold winter day.   Good selection of drafts/bottled brews. I had a refreshing glass of sangria. They change the ingredients on the sangria pretty regularly too. If it wasn't in such a weird location, it would be a good spot for just drinks.    Why no 5-star? The fries were not very impressive. It does take an hour even on weeknights to get a table (even though it doesn't appear crowded, because they text you when your table is ready and people just leave - which seems detrimental to the bar business). And they put 5 of us clearly at a table for 4. Eeking a 5 star outta me would require a little more menu exploration; one of those milkshakes is likely the tipping point.",

    "text": "Having been a little disappointed in our go-to burger joint near Shadyside during our last few visits, we came to the Burgatory, and it far exceeded my expectations. We started with the truffle oil and gorgonzola fries - AMAZING. I also started with the Burnt Almond Torte shake since I love Prantl's Burnt Almont Torte. This was very good as well. As my entre, I tried the Phat Patti's Vegie burger. Between the fries and the shake I was pretty full at this point so I didn't eat much, but I enjoyed what I had. As you can probably guess, the shakes are filling so if you plan to get one, come hungry or consider passing on the appetizer (although I know I will never be able to pass on the truffle fries).  My one complaint is that there was way too much whipped cream on the shake (the whipped cream took up 1/3 of the glass), but it came with a \"refill\" cup so there was still plenty of shake to drink if you could make it through the whipped cream.",

    "text": "When I came home for winter break, I tried this place out with my friends. It was fairly crowded, but because there's a lot of other stores around the place, it went by fairly quickly.  One thing I really liked about this place was the clever signs. \"Blessed be the burgers.\" \"helluva burger + heavenly shakes\". Kind of blasphemous, but funny. There are more signs in the restaurant as well. I also liked the small towers of fire.. it was fairly cold when we went so it was very nice and good at warming you up!  Okay, so I like the inside, but I didn't really like the burger.. I really liked how you can choose everything and make your own burger and what you want in it, but the actual meat itself was only eh. The meat tasted funny.. maybe it had something to do with the all natural + hormone free thing. Oh, it was also HUGE. So hard to eat. Everything spilling out, bun breaking, burger breaking.. it was more like a huge ginormous salad in the end. Filling though.  The milkshakes are really good too! Friends got the caramel pretzel (it actually has pretzels!) and it was pretty good but I found it way too sweet and too thick for my taste.  We got the giant cookie and ice cream for dessert. I found the cookie to be \"eh\", but the ice cream was SO delicious! Home-made ice cream was real good stuff.",

I'm not sure what part of tomato allergy they didn't understand. Then it took us another 20 minutes to get our check after I said I couldn't eat it. They weren't busy and now I know why",

    "text": "I have been here many times and the burgers are really good. I always build my own burger. The prices have gone up since the last time I was there. Not a lot, but you only get three \"no buck\" toppings like tomato or pickle instead of four. I got a fourth one and it was only $ 0.75 more. The base burger price went up as well. I got the lettuce wrap instead of the bun. I expected the lettuce wrap to be like a lettuce bun that other restaurants have. It was just two pieces of lettuce. I ended up eating the burger with utensils. However, the burger was very good and was \"pink\" as ordered.  The milkshakes are also very good. They are fairly large, but they can provide a to go cup for your leftover milkshake. The server was attentive and refilled drinks in a timely manner.  The only main issue is that they don't seem to be using the Yelp app to reserve tables anymore. At least they weren't using it when I was there. We usually put our name on the list on the drive over. This time it said \"0 minute wait\" and wouldn't let us add our name. I wasn't concerned since there was no wait. When we got there, there was a long wait and we gave our number for a text when our table was ready. When I asked the girl about the Yelp app, she had no idea what I was talking about. I would recommend removing that feature if you are not using it as it appeared that you had no wait. I am also letting anyone know not to trust the wait time listed as it may not be accurate.",

I would not have even been bothered by this so much, especially since they took half off his meal, if our waitress hadn't dumped my plate on me when she was clearing the table. I had potato chips in my lap, and my mayo covered knife slid down my arm.  She said \"oops, sorry\" and that was it. Never got refils on my drink either.

I think that the only problem is the wait, but that could more so be because so many people want to come here. I recently was here for happy hour and I was pleasantly surprised at their happy hour specials. I would say that happy hour might be the way to go if you want drinks and appys. I have had a lot of their burgers but these are the ones that I recently tried out.   Drinks: Strawberry Basil Shag: Vintage Vodka Cocktail with a tasty combination of Fresh Berries & Basil. This one goes down way too easy. This one does go down super easy. It was delish. I would love to just have it in a water bottle and take it on a nice tropical vacation. Yum. It was fresh and not too sweet. Perfectly paired with appys and burgers!  Southern Charm: Bourbon, Vodka & Black Tea muddled with Fresh Mint & Lemon. Finished with Peach Bitters. I love a good tea boozy drink. Tea's are my thing and this one was no joke. YUMMY. I think that the fresh mint and lemon were a great addition to the drink. I would order this one again, and again, and...again.   Appetizers: Honey Habanero Wings: A great combination of sweet & heat. Buffalo Sauce & Bourbon BBQ available for those more traditionally minded. These were fried to perfection. I would have liked a little more sauce on them but now I know to ask for extra for next time. They were hot, so do not be fooled. I hate when some places say habanero wings and they taste like cayenne, these ones are hot so just watch out.   Pommes Frites: Cut Fresh by Hand All Day, Every Day. Truffled Gorgonzola. A must have addition to any visit to Burgatory. Do not skip, do not pass, do not think eh, not today. Just order them and be done with it. They are great and you will be messing up  your entire experience here if you do not order them!!  Burgers: Piggy Butter & Jelly: Cajun Dusted Ground Beef & Ground Bacon Burger with White American Cheese, Candied Bacon, Bread & Butter Pickles, Peanut Butter & Habanero Jelly. As disgusting as this sounds this was probably my favorite burger on the menu. It was so weird it was good. I loved how the taste really melded together to make something wonderful. Try it out, even if you order it for the table and everyone takes a bite. Just try it out and go from there. You will not be disappointed. And if you are at least you can say you got to try out a burger that has pb and j on it!  Elk Gone Wild: Diablo Dusted Grass Fed Elk Burger, Smoked Gouda, Caramelized Onion Marmalade & Bacon Jam with Roasted Tomato Vinaigrette tossed Arugula. This burger is spicy! The diablo dust is not a joking matter. The only thing I can say is that while this burger was good, elk is super dry because it is so lean. I was not thrilled with the taste of it and thought they could have cut it with something else to bring a little moisture in. I would probably not order this again. While good, it wasn't so great that it is on my must try again list.   I like it here and you should too! This is a great place to grab drinks or a quick meal before a movie or to go on a nice date. I would highly recommend coming during happy hour and taking advantage of all the good deals. Maybe I will see you here!",

I would go back just for these milkshakes.   They also sell a dry-aged Wagyu burger for really cheap - only $14.50! For those that may be unfamiliar (because I definitely was until a few days ago), dry-aged Wagyu is particularly expensive not only because it's a high quality marbly type of meat, but because of the extensive way it has to be prepared. Dry-aged meats are hung to dry and effectively lose a great deal of volume during this process and then are trimmed, causing an even further lost in weight. However the end product is a delicious concentration of rich flavor with a smooth buttery texture - how can you not love that. Unless you don't eat meat... Then I'm sorry. Their Portobello burger is pretty good.  Tl;dr -- Quick, casual, reasonable prices, and great food... what more can you ask for?",

The shake (coffee and donut) was great other than than the chicken sandwiches were mediocre and somewhat burnt tasting. As we don't eat beef, I ordered build your own chicken sandwiches, 2 veggie sandwiches from the menu and one chicken sandwich from the menu. But except for the build your own, others were simply not worth the money. I felt like it was a complete waste of my money for just the shake. Would not suggest if you are not a beef eater (not for vegetarians)",

The toppings we're generous and flavorful  The brioche bun was soft and almost buttery and redeemed/balanced the intense filling flavors within it.  The meat was slightly too dense yet had signifant savoury flavor. It lacked a string maillard crisp exterior. The burgers flavors were sharp, though not poor. The sauce was a bit strong and bit too much Cabernet.   Burgatory is a good choice in this area. I'd head back if I wasn't in the mood to fight downtown Pittsburgh traffic.",

The salad serving was huge and the waitress kept the water refills rollin'.   If you live by the saying, \"A moment on the lips is forever on the hips\" I don't think Burgatory is your go to. All self proclaimed meat eating, deep fried, food bloggers step on up!   There was an issue with my salad (the gross kind no one wants to discover when chompin' down on some greens) and my waitress quickly brought me out a new salad. The service is quick, the ordering process is different and fun.   Good place to try out. The other bonus is the bathroom is dark and play loud music. No need to worry if your intestines start to blow smokes like a diesel truck. Cheers!",

    "text": "Finally made a trip to the famous Burger bar mini kingdom, with my family.... Expecting to be a little more blown away than I was. The atmosphere is nice nouveau night time feel yet comfortable minus the huge bar stealing all the seating from drooling patrons.   Down to business the burgers: high quality beef which I appreciated nice bread, but overlooked outside of my burger was completely blackened which took away from other tastes for example I could not taste the cheese. The point in having fun non traditional burgers is flavor but you lose some of that if you cook it too fast. At the risk of sounding like a pretentious foodie jerk I preferred my own smoked salmon wasabi burger, and made them for the same price.   On the bright side I love the beer selection excellent range and FIN DU LA MONDE!!!! Belgian lovers I urged you to check that one out! But other options await you too from stouts to lighter beers.   Last note the do not take reservations.... This just sucks it does. The average wait is an hour Friday nights but it could take longer. They expect you love walking around a strip mall to wait.... I don't love strip malls. They offer no indoor seating area for you to wait in and waiting in the cramped entrance area is Just awkward sauce.  Your other option is to dive into the bar and grab the first empty bar stool. Yea no thanks not for a party of three. If they changed this way of doing things I would eat here again I am curious to try a better reviewed location and see what I think.   You can make a custom burger toppings add $$$ quick and pray tell why do they not you know of this while you're spending an hour plus waiting? I could have been creating my meal vs browsing for slippers :(  So far it's just ok and like many places here overhyped for quality of food they offer.",

I started with a vanilla shake w/o cookie garnish and it was fantastic! Followed with the farmer's burger (ham+sunny side egg). While the menu states \"if severely sensitive, avoid due to preparation method\", the waitress explained that the ham and egg are prepared on the same surface as the toasted non-GF buns and that the chef could prepare those in a separate pan. The burger did not disappoint! I loved every bite. My husband got the honey-habanero wings and liked the sauce so much, he asked for additional sauce to dip his burger! Daughter got the cookie shake and actually closed her eyes to savor the first sip. Overall, great experience!!",

You have a wide ranger of pre-designed burgers that you can choose from, however what I have always found to be enjoyable is the build-your-own burger option.  You get to choose everything from the type of meat they use to the rub they put on it, the type of bun and all the toppings.  You could easily spend a large portion of your visit here just trying to come up with different burger choices.  If you are someone who does not like that much freedom or choice, I would suggest sticking with their pre-designed burger menu.  Another option they have is milkshakes - both alcoholic and non-alcoholic.  They come in a variety of flavors and all of the ones that I have tried have been stellar.  They do also offer choices for the non-meat eaters in your group.  Veggie burgers are on the menu, as are a number of fish choices.    So far, the only disappointment I have had with the menu is that I get too full too quickly, and don't always have the opportunity to try everything I wish to eat.",

The onion rings were huge, by the way.  Finally, the Smore's Shake.  Quite simply it was the greatest milkshake that I've ever had in my life.  It was chocolatey and had ground up graham crackers in it and it just made the greatest and most flavorful texture that I've ever experienced in a milkshake.

I was excited that it was a build your own burger bar with a veggie burger option, since I'm a vegetarian.   I love barbecue anything, and it's rare that I get to experience good BBQ as a non-meat eater. I decided to get the veggie burger with a BBQ rub, farmhouse cheddar, BBQ sauce, and grilled onions. Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed in the flavor and texture of the burger, I guess I should have guessed that their BBQ wasn't that popular because none of their suggested burgers combinations featured barbecue sauce. I also ordered a s'mores (non-alcoholic) shake that, to me, was just okay.   My boyfriend got an actual burger that had similar rub/toppings and was also pretty disappointed.   I think next time I go I will get an already-recommended combo of toppings. I think Burgatory has potential to be delicious, my expectations were just a little too high for my first time.",

When we arrived, we were told the wait would be 30-40 minutes.  At about an hour, we checked in with the hostess who admitted accidentally giving part of our table away (we had 8 people).  We continued to wait, patiently, not complaining, just hanging out having a beer (two of us in our group had many years of restaurant experience, so we know that shit happens sometimes).  The bartender offered us a round on the house and the manager offered us a free appetizer with our meal.  Jimmy and the staff that night were great and definitely made up for the mistake and our delayed dinner.  This place is owned by the same guys that own Fuel and Fuddle - one of my favorite Pittsburgh restaurants that holds many great memories from my college days at PITT.  As with F& F, the food at Burgatory was killer!  We'll definitely be back the next time we're in the Burgh!  Thanks again!",

We didn't get the beers, but the bar looked active.   It was freezing cold and I wish I had a jacket. Seats were pretty comfortable and gave a good view of the restaurant. Lots of families and seems like a good date place. I would take a wife or girlfriend here. Not sure if it's cool for large groups. Unless you sit outside, there was not a lot of room for more than 5 people.   My elk burger was spicy but good. There was a lot of break, so I might try the salad next time. There was a lot of meat, but not much cheese or sauce. I guess that's what you really want in a burger. Also, as I ordered it well done, it wasn't dry or bland. You'll taste the meat! Cool place to go and hang for a while.",

The burger itself was a little small but fine but when it came to substituting my side, I picked \"organic greens\" which I also got on my burger and were simply pieces of lettuce. But when it came on the side for an additional $1.50 it was a side salad with cheese, tomatoes and dressing which I can't tolerate. When it arrived to asked to have just the burger and for them to take the salad back. There were no other acceptable side items and the up-charge was not removed from the bill. It was the point of it really - the menu is misleading and such a small charge not removed when I can't eat the side.   For my husband he ordered a burger off the menu. It was too raw in the middle so he stopped eating it before he finished and he actually got sick in the middle of the night which delayed us heading home from our trip.  I would not necessarily recommend.",

The chili has big chunks of chicken and a subtle spicy kick the blend of the sour cream, cheese and onion is are perfect toppings. The warm Jalapeno & Cheddar Cornbread on the side is a heavenly accompaniment to the chili.   I was glad the chili left room in my stomach for the milkshake. I decided to get the featured milkshake for the 4th of July holiday: The red, white and blue. I believe it was made with vanilla ice cream, chunks of white cake, blueberry & strawberry sauces topped with whipped cream and red, white & blue sprinkles.

I had the elk burger and while it was a pretty thick patty, it was overdone and had pieces of cartilage throughout. Taste wise, it was bland. I ordered their menu burger instead of making my own. The sauces did nothing to enhance it. I also had the almond torte shake. I miss the days when they would leave almost half a container of leftovers for you instead of the two tablespoons I received. The shake was really heavy on the whipped cream. Otherwise, it's pretty tasty and I will probably get it again.",

Their signature milkshakes are delightful and well worth the price. You get a large amount (more than enough to share between two), and the mixes are sweet but well balanced.   Burgatory allows you to make \"custom\" burgers, and have a huge amount of customizability. It's a great option when you have mixed dietary restrictions (e.g., no pork, no fiber, etc.) and want everyone to have options.   Other items on their menu are more of a miss for me. Their version of poutine is extremely salty and oily, and their farmhouse salads tend to be overdressed. The slaw they offer as an extra side to your burger is overwhelmingly peppery.   Overall, a great spot to come after a movie or if you're looking for a burger, but I'd come here more for the shakes.",

Some of the worst service I have had in years, red flag when the server wrote my order on the back of my son's order.     Drinks took FOREVER to arrive, a milk shake arrived first then ten minutes later a mixed drink.  Burgers took over thirty minutes to arrive then only two came, one of which had the wrong toppings.   Five minutes later, \" yours will be right out sir\"    They forgot to make it.   Forgot to make it because it was written on the back of another order.     Oh, thanx for the cold and greasy chips while I waited.  NOT ....    it finally arrived, luke warm, soggy bun, slimy.     They took it off the bill, luckily or the review would be worse.

A person who follows these eating practices may not want a burger that bleeds, has a pink tinge to it or even tastes like beef.   I've been a vegetarian for 15 years and bitting into that burger horrified me. I spit it out and had a family member check to make sure it was actually fake. We even had the waiter come over and he seemed annoyed that I asked.   So this is my warning to all vegetarian/vegan community - ask questions, stick with the salads (those are actually really good) or try their vegan veggie - if you dare.",

    "text": "I've been to Burgatory quite a few times with my daughter and her friends. I almost always order a burgers even though I rarely eat red meat. These are just too good to pass up! You can order different condiments, cheeses, vegetables (lettuce, tomato, avocado, etc), sauces, etc., and really customize your burger. They also have veggie patties if you prefer to skip the meat. I can't remember what is in them, but they are a tasty alternative to a red meat burger. They also have great salads. We shared a peppercorn caesar salad and the contrast between the hot kick of the peppercorns and the smooth, almost sweet dressing was fabulous. The chicken chili is another good option for something lighter than the burgers.   Besides exceptional burgers, this place is known for its milkshakes. I've never tried one with alcohol but my friends raved about them. I've had a few of their non-alcoholic milkshakes and they are super thick, rich, with lots of flavor--the chocolate milkshakes are especially yummy!   If you try to get in here on a Friday or Saturday evening, be prepared for a very long wait. I'm not a big advocate of waiting long for a table, so I try to hit this place during less popular hours.",

It was soooo deliciously sweet and salty. Who doesn't love that combo?!   I chose the \"meet your maker\" burger. I wasn't looking at the prices, this just appealed to me the most.  I mean, as soon as I saw truffled aioli, that was my obvious choice. I was so happy with this decision. The burger was juicy and tender, and you could taste the freshness of the toppings. I'm not one to be wowed by tomatoes, but whatever tomatoes ended up on this burger were flippin GREAT!   5 stars for service. Everyone was overly friendly and we got a run down of the menu since it was our first time.",

Burgers are a favourite food for me so I liked this place and have gone many times, never having a bad experience. The service has always been quick and attentive and when I order a burger rare, it actually comes out rare (this is more uncommon than you'd think and I am happy if I get a medium-rare burger when I order rare).  One thing I wish they'd add to the menu is a spicy burger, I know they have one burger with a bit of peppers but it really isn't spicy. For me a kick-in-the-ass burger would be a welcome addition to the menu.",

Again, on a trip with the fam, we stayed across the street from this joint and i love to visit off the chain places.  And this place is just that! It seems they thought of everything! The decor! The slogans, the garage door patio, the milkshakes, the burger menu, i mean...what don't they do!?!  I didn't have an adult beverage, but I would imagine they were good too!  The little had the hot dog and deconstructed it and still loved it.   I got the Steak/Morton burger and it was good. It was even good 3 hours later on the highway! Lots of onion straws. I could've used maybe a little more cheese.  DH made his own burger and thank God that was an option.  An to end it...I got the Carmel pretzel milkshake. Like...how do the pieces of the pretzel stay whole an not soggy in the glass (and a half) you get of it. My daughter said they use special \"permenant\" prezels that never get soft. She may be right!  The fries were actually the BEST thing on the menu to me. I need a week to just try stuff from this place. But the fries...perfection.  I miss you already Burgatory. Being bad never tasted so good! (is that they're slogan because I seriously just made that up).",

We went on a Friday night and the place was packed! We had a 25 minute wait but it went by quick. (thank God for Angry Birds!) So the hostess came and took us to our booth. FYI walk slowly or you will bust your ass. Their floor is extremely slippery. I don't know if there's grease on the floor or what.   We looked over the menu and started off with the Berry Lemonade and the Bourbon BBQ Sriracha Wings. They were both delicious! Next we both had the Standard Deluxe Burger. It's a burger with White American Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion and their House Burger Sauce. It was huge and outstanding! The homemade potato chips are really good also.   I also like the fact that you can build your own burger in 7 steps .   Step 1. Pick your burger.   You have a choice of beef, chicken, bison, sausage, lumb crab or veggie patty as a burger.   Step 2. Pick your bun.   Next you pick your bun with Brioche, Wheat, Baguette, Focaccia,  Topless or Full Monty Style as choices   Step 3. Pick your rub.   Choose from Angel Dust, Kona Crust, BBQ, Kingston Jerk,  Cracked Peppercorn and Bayou Cajun   Step 4. Pick your cheese for $1 more   Choose from Cheddar, White American, Horseradish Cheddar,  Sharp Provolone, Gorgonzola, Mozzarella, Smoked Gouda and Buffalo Cheddar.   Step 5. Pick your sauce.   Choose from Bourbon BBQ, Dijon Mayo, Banana Ketchup, House Sauce, Spicy Marinara, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Roasted Garlic Mayo, Sriracha Remoulade, Buttermilk Ranch, Spicy Ketchup,  Whole Grain Mustard, Avocado Wasabi, Bleu Cheese Dressing,  Buffalo Sauce, Relish and Chipotle Sour Cream   Step 6. Pick a topping for $1 more.   Choose from Fried Egg, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Avocado, Chicken Chili, Caramelized Onion Marmalade, Grilled Pineapple, Sauteed Mushrooms, Maple Cured Ham, Onion Straws, Roasted Tomatoes, Grilled Onions, Brandied Peppercorn, Cabernet Sauce and Roasted Red Peppers.   Step 7. Pick a free topping.   Choose from Iceberg, Romaine, Field Greens, Baby Spinach,  Arugula, Red Onion, Tomato, Poblano Peppers, Cucumbers, Banana Peppers, Bread & Butter Pickles and Jalapenos. Lots of choices and ways to customize your burger.   Burgatory is my new favorite burger place!",

Little messy to eat... maybe that is why they brought extra napkins. Very good burger cooked just as requested: pink center. Sticky fingers were justified by the delicious bun full of goodies.  This is not something you shovel down in a couple of minutes. You eat it slowly and enjoy each bite.   Chips didn't do anything for me, but I did not visit for the chips.

I also prefer the truffle Gorgonzola frites over the cheddar jalapeno- although if you order the latter ask for a side of ranch. They recently added a gluten free bun! I was excited, I've been eating \"naked\" burgers for quite some time. The bun itself is a little cold and hard. But it is a bun nonetheless! I was happy to see it on the menu. I'm also happy that they consistently offer a cider on their draft list. My favorite cocktail is the grapes on, vodka with muddled grapes and basil I think. When it's busy the service is slow, so I would not recommend going during peak hours (11:30-2, 6-8:30).",

I went back with my boyfriend this past weekend on a Sat. night.  Mistake.  We were told it would be a two hour wait.  We were really looking forward to eating here again, and it was a bit of a drive, so we browsed some stores to kill the time.    Two hours later we were seated in the heated patio area, which was cold despite the heat lamps.  Our waitress was pushy, not giving us enough time to order.  Nor did she refill our water glasses until I asked at the end.    Not the best experience.  If you go, go at an off time.

    "text": "So Canadian friend of Joe (CFOJ) came in to visit his old buddy before heading off to Philly on business and he calls me from the hotel and says \"I need dead cow meat! I want it on a fluffy bun and I want it rare and I want a side of home made chips to scarf down my gullet, eh?\" Okay I added the \"eh\" part, because oddly CFOJ never says eh, even though he hails from Vancouver. And he really didn't call saying I want dead cow, etc. He basically said \"hey let's go have a burger somewhere\". I needed a good intro as an attention grabber, my bad yo!  So a few minutes later I'm searching frantically on Yelp to find him a great burger joint and quickly remembered a new place in waterworks mall called \"Burgatory\". So I pick him up at the hotel and off to that place we go.  It's 6pm on a Friday night and the place is hopping like 4 frogs on a hot frying pan. I walk up to the desk and leave my name and cell phone number and they promise me in 75 minutes I'll be seated. Good thing there is a Barnes & Noble, TJMaxx and 5 Below close to shop at while your table waiting. Well in the time we went shopping, I got three texts from Burgatory giving me updates and believe it on not on the 75th minute, a text came and the table was ready, how do they do that???  We are seated, I order a Sam Adams, and the waitress explains to us to grab a worksheet and check off what we want our burgers to look like when they come out. Let me explain, you pick the type of meat (beef, chicken, crab cake, bison, or vegan) bun (white, wheat, foccocia etc) then there are different dry rubs, toppings, veggies, etc. It's pure genius! And for those of you not enterprising enough to grab a little bowling pencil and build a burger, they have pre existing burgers in the menu you can order. I love this place!  I order a veggie burger, with Cajun rub, fresh spinach, Spanish onion, grainy mustard, and horseradish cheddar. CFOJ decided he wanted a plain cheese burger with good old American cheese and bacon. But he was as giddy as an ugly school girl with prom date to see the long list of milk shakes on the menu and ordered the s'mores shake. It came with a huge toasted marshmallow on top of the whipped cream, it looked better than it tasted. He loved it, I wasn't impressed because to me a milk shake should be creamy, where this shake was gritty with ground up graham crackers in it. I'll stick with Sam Adams.  One thing about restaurant made veggie burgers, they all seem to fall apart, and no surprise here, Burgatory's did too. Great flavor, a bit dry, seems like it was mostly grains (oatmeal, onions, herbs) I wish a restaurant would try tempeh or vital wheat gluten as a base to see if it will stay in one piece. The plate was also piled high with home made potato and sweet potato chips, not the least bit greasy and great crunch, almost like kettle chips. This place has great atmosphere, it can get a bit loud, and because it's new it may take awhile to get a table, but it's all worth it (yes, even driving the death trap called RT 28) so give Burgatory a try, this maybe the funnest time you have at a burger joint.",

    "text": "This Burger Bar turned Haute cuisine presents meticulous preparation and careful presentation of food, at a minimal price level, accompanied by a great beer selection. Although the potato 'chips' given with every order are less than desirable, other side options are available. The Malt Shakes provided are a perfect compliment to any meal, and are eachly unigue. The service is fantastic! Waiters/Waitresses are well skilled on the menu and all of it's resultant combinations.  ...It is in your best option to make reservations ahead of time, for an average dinner wait could set you back a good 45 minutes, but it is well worth it. Many people try to compare Burgatory with BRGR, which is a similar burger joint in Pittsburgh. Let me first say that Burgatory is alike only in the fact that it serves gourmet meat patties, but BRGR definitely surpasses the Haute quality on many levels. Overall, if you are desiring a good buger with the availablility of countless toppings, Burgatory is the best bet. The only gripe I hold, is that they do not have Blue Cheese or a Buffalo sauce, nor an option of a crispy grilled Foie gras. 8/10 ...Go Steelers..",

    "text": "Ah, gustatory Burgatory.  Outside of the State Fair of Texas, I've never seen so many grams of fat in so small a meal (not a True story).  There are so many wonderful things to say about Burgatory: the drinks are awesome (try the spiked milkshakes), the burgers are excellent (ask your server about the burger of the day and remember Saturday is wild game day), and the fries, while very salty, are excellent.  Burgers come with house-made potato chips that I don't particularly like, but they'll gladly substitute fries for those.  The bland strip mall that serves as Burgatory's location does no justice to the amazing service and food you'll find inside.  The one thing that brings this down from five stars to four is the wait.  I'm not sure *any* burger is worth a two-hour wait, so I tend to hit Burgatory later in the evening, at which point I'm nearly starving, the servers are visibly worn out, and the wait is a mere one hour instead of two.  At least there's a Barnes & Noble a few doors down.",

    "text": "Pro's: - If there is a line, you can put yourself on the list over the internet. It saves a few minutes.  Con's: - No waiting area at all, minus a bench on the outside, which is useless since it's not covered and it's currently winter. You feel like a cow on the way to the slaughterhouse with the way people are packed in at the restaurant. You also have to try to avoid the doors and running into people eating. - It's always packed and I couldn't imagine going there on a Friday or Saturday. - No yellow American cheese. Their version of American cheese is not as good. - They have a habit of burning burgers bad. They went 2 for 2 in my 2 visits in burning them. - They make you fill out a sheet stating what you want for your burger. It takes too long to fill it out and then they screw it up anyway because no one can understand it. Writing down what you want is the waitress' job, not the customer's. - Want fries with your burger? You're paying extra.  - The service is slow and you might as well be playing \"Where's Waldo?\" when its time to find your waitress. - Everyone who works there looks really weird. Tattoos, piercings, hair dye, strange attires, the works.  Overall thoughts: Not sure how this place got the best burger in Pittsburgh, but obviously, they paid someone off. It's okay but not on the level of Red Robin or some other great burger places here. This place is an expensive, hippie filled mess and they need to get their act together if they want to grow. The number one thing they need to work on is the waiting area, as you are either packed and trying not to run into people or you're gonna be sitting in the cold outside.",

    "text": "I've visited twice, once on a Friday night and once on an off-peak week night. Going on a Friday night is/was a mistake. The place is packed, you can't make reservations as I understand it, and they have an odd procedure for putting your name down. We witnessed people being given upwards of 15-20 minutes to return once they were informed there table was ready. Frustrating. But I knew it was gonna suck as far as wait being Friday night. I'm a firm believer that NO meal is worth waiting for, expecially for for waiting over and hour - for a burger. But as I said that one is on me for going on a Friday night. My other visit was much more pleasant and prompt.   Out of all the new burger joints in the 'Burgh. This place is the winner thus far. Portion sizes up to par. Tasty food. Ability to create your own burger. The only improvement would be the one I make for just about every restaurant - please stop using vegetable oil for frying. It tastes like crap and it's horrible for your health. Lard, bacon fat, butter, etc. All far better options.   Burgatory has offically been added to the rotation, I'll be back.",

    "text": "I struggle with deciding whether to give it three or four stars.  The burgers blow every other burger joint in the county, out of the water.  Hands down.  But little intricacies here and there made me raise an eyebrow on more than one occasion.  But, the burgers make up for it; so I'll go with 4 stars.  -1/4 star for pointless TVs  on the walls (I really hate the American need for constant brainwashing.  And all that was on was the ESPN sports ticker) -1/4 star for Heinz not being the ketchup of choice in their red squirt bottles (I'm Pittsburgh born and bred bitches, I know my condiments! I almost took a whole star  for this alone, but I changed my mind after I finished my entire burger) -1/4 star for mediocre service (I had to ask for a water refill?  And the kitchen over-cooked my burger.  I wanted pink, I got it well done.  They're lucky it still blew me away in flavor.  Plus our waitress was rarely to be seen on the floor.  Probably too busy flirting and distracting the grill cook in the kitchen ;-)) -1/4 star for uncomfortable metal chairs.  We went on a Friday night and only had to wait 45 minutes.  I didn't think this was a big deal on a summer Friday evening.  Plus, the hostesses take your cell phone # down on an iPad and call you when your table is ready.  45 minutes is enough time to mosey and walk around The Waterworks to window shop and kill time; however, most people choose to wait and hover around the front door.  Going in, the ambiance is pretty badass for a burger joint.  It makes more sense than BRGR's ambiance (sleazy bachelor pad meets grease monkey).  A LOT of design work and detail went into the space, the lighting, the menus, the table caddies, and the \"create-your-own\" burger pad; that we appreciate.  The owner definitely spent a pretty penny on a sweet branding theme.  The ironic thing about Burgatory and their \"devil\" like setting is that the majority of the clientele is *bigger*...and well, probably in a health purgatory.  There are ZERO healthy options.  ZERO.  If you're health and super food conscious - just don't go here. U won't find anything modifiable enough besides a plain piece of chicken.    But we put in a killer workout 6 days a week to eat the way we want and this was our one day a week cheat meal.  And so glad we picked this place to do it!!!  The burgers they offer are all way more inventive than BRGR.  They're creative, they're named less offensively, and you can substitute (thank the lord!!!  We have allergies to some foods).  But truly, the way to go is to create your own masterpiece.  Tim W. Breaks it down in his review (Thanks dude) how to create it.  There are soooooooooo many options.  You could go back 100 times and try a new combination every time.     I ordered a beef burger, on an herbed foccaccia bun, peppercorn rub, with sauteed mushrooms and onion straws (no cheese - allergic to dairy).  My boyfriend had the bison, with whole wheat bun, peppercorn rub, with sauteed mushrooms and roasted red pepper.  I got the chips, he got the rosemary and sea salt French fries.  The first thing we noticed when we picked up our burgers - THEY HAVE WEIGHT AND MASS!!!  These are dense ass burgers!!!  And, I didnt have to pull off half the bun to find my burger!! ( BRGR ). Truly, after my first bite I said, \"Ok, I have to go edit my BRGR review and take away ANOTHER star.  They shouldn't exist compared to here.\". My burger, even over-cooked, was phenomenal.  So much flavor, I didn't even need ketchup all that much (so I didn't mind too much THEN that it wasn't Heinz because I didn't NEED it).  The chips were awesome (but Buffalo Blues still wins the battle for homemade chips).  But the rosemary and sea salt French fries?  I'll go back for THOSE!!!    In the end, this is THEE place to go if you're craving a to-die-for burger.  It helps that the sin going down my gullet is too good to even think of the horrible things that are going into my body.  We left very satisfied, very full, and already thinking about what we would order the next time. Skip BRGR, drive over the river, and indulge in Burgatory.  Worth the price and experience!!!",

    "text": "My first overall experience at Burgatory was pretty amazing.  My friend and I arrived on a Tuesday evening and were told to expect a 20-30 minute wait but we got in after less than 15 minutes upon receiving a text message that our table was ready - a feature that I LOVE and I wish more restaurants would incorporate.  I decided to order a custom-made burger and my anticipation for my food to arrive was pretty intense.  To distract myself as I waited, we split an order of the truffle gorgonzola fries.  The fries were so-so, but the cheese was really delicious.  Our burgers arrived after a slightly longer than usual wait, and it was definitely worthy of a foodgasm.  I got a hormone-free beef patty, herbed focaccia bread, buffalo cheddar (which tasted just like nacho cheese - not quite my fav), sauteed mushrooms, onion straws, sour cream, and a fried egg.  We decided to nickname my burger The Escape Artist because as I was eating it, my egg kept trying to rapel out of my sandwich, despite my repeated attempts to seal its fate by stuffing it back in my sandwich.  I later discovered that the egg's repeated escape attempts were just a distraction to allow my onions and mushrooms to jump ship, because despite me finishing my huge burger with all the fixings, I had enough leftover onions and mushrooms to make my own plate of sliders.  Needless to say, they don't skimp on the toppings.  The side of sweet potato chips we received were also really nice.  Not at all greasy, they were a really nice, subtle compliment to that flavor monster of a burger.  We wrapped up our meals with a caramel pretzel milkshake.  Absolutely amazing.  The milkshake had actually hunks of pretzel in it, so it comes with a rather wide straw.  The milkshake was nice and thick but wasn't overly sweet.  It was a great way to end the meal.  The only con I have was that we were seated at a tall table accompanied by tall chairs, and the seats of the chairs were definitely on the small side.  It took a bit of adjusting to find a comfortable position, and I'm definitely requesting a table or booth the next time.  But overall, the food was really fantastic and I can't wait to get back there to create my next burger masterpiece!",

Only slight complaint is meat usually too done for my liking, but I prefer my beef walk to the table after a quick tatoo from the grill. Flavor still topnotch. Nice to stumble on a place in the burgh that cares about quality. They could hold their even own in Houston & Austin.",

With each bite I asked myself \"What have I done?\"  Had I come up with a challenge too great for even my stomach? The soft baguette, a kind that differed from the chewy, crispy baguette I am used to, contained the innards of the burger as well as an aristocrat's hoagie bun could.   Another lightning bolt epiphany struck me from the open skies as I gorged: Bison is the blood-red meat of immortal warriors, the kind served to the victorious on the battlefield and to the fallen in The Hall of the Slain. Its leanness, tenderness revealed a connection to the Earth and the ancient hunter-gatherers that once brought these behemoths of the plains down with arrow and spear. Its sweetness, richness made it fit for celestials.  The clash was grueling, the divinely homemade potato chips crunched beneath The Doomburger, conspiring to prematurely snuff out my bellyfire, but endure I did! \"IF I AM TO YAK THIS DAY, THEN MAY IT BE IN BATTLE\" I cried, channeling the dialogue of Stan Lee!   And before I could comprehend it, the meat was gone. Only a few bites of bread, egg, American-and-Cheddar-usurping Gouda, and onion shafts remained, the sturdy, flavorful chips reduced to particles. Thus ended a battle that could have only been depicted justly by the late Jack Kirby in a 64-page comic book annual.   The fog of Brimstone parted and two roads appeared to me. One promised milkshake pleasures of various kinds. The other was  guarded by The Ginormous Chocolate Chip Cookie Sundae and The Angels & Demons cupcakes.   Feeling impetuous, invincible, I would take both roads.   For days I had mulled over my milkshake choice, and the Campfire S'Mores won over the Caramel Pretzel. It came before I could gather my wits. A massive graham-cracker dusted marshmallow turret, one that couldn't have been bagged and had to have been made in-house was what I first noticed. I pulled it off and daringly devoured it. I sampled the whipped cream, which also tasted fresh, unprocessed. The ice cream itself was golden, hand-turned. The straw was hard plastic with a wide opening to allow for the s'more debris. Additional milkshake came in a large metal cup. I finished it all, ignoring my stomach's signals to walk away and marched towards the Cookie Sundae. The soft-baked cookie yielded to my fork as did the same vanilla bean ice cream. A few bites later, and I sensed defeat. I scooped the ice cream into a plastic cup and the cookie into a box. This fight would conclude another day.   Knowing that my limit had been sufficiently taxed, I avoided Kay's cupcakes. The Burgatory logo had been drawn onto the plate in strawberry puree at the feet of an Angel Food/Chocolate Buttercream and its opposite number; Devil's Food/Vanilla Buttercream.   Bourdain is a prophet. The top-heavy Angel Food collapsed upon my angry gaze! Hah!   The arcane individual mentioned in Part One met us on the way out. He revealed himself to be The Owner/Adversary. When I mentioned that I nearly ate myself sick, he replied \"Gooood\" while rubbing his hands and grinning, seemingly impressed that I survived his machinations and his engines of temptation and indigestion.   Kay and I made it out to the parking lot.   *Caution. The following passage is graphic. The circumstances are entirely my own fault.*  I tried to fight it off. This hadn't happened to me in ten years and never before due to overindulgence.   I vomited ice cream, cold ice cream, onto the asphalt. I had become a human soft serve dispenser. The Owner's cacophonous cackling deluged the lot and tormented my ears. I had finally eaten myself nauseous. I had been made into a glutton.  Kay just giggled, and I felt fine afterwards. No one else saw me spew. From there we made our way home. The next morning, I quietly finished the sundae. The ice cream had since hardened in the icebox. The cookie, after being nuked, reached the consistency of a pancake. I didn't mind and ate slowly. It was Sunday morning, and the nightmare was over.   Pit your soul against the most lightless powers of cookery fathomable. Confront the horrors that lie within Burgatory. You will emerge from the ordeal a stronger being.  P.S. I forgot to mention that this song was playing on the Liquid Metal satellite radio station as we searched for Burgatory. I SWEAR!  Eerie foreshadowing?  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DHqcOVzx4CqY&s=b3984dc9cf0c300c19f60c876ba1a86b18e16dbc8956562dc5b51e9c694a691f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=HqcO...</a>",

    "text": "I suppose I could have seen it as an omen, that when I searched for Burgatory on my Yelp app, it asked me, \" Did you mean \"purgatory\"?\". Despite that glowing recommendation we hit this eatery on our way out of Pittsburgh, after a day trip there.  My traveling companion had stumbled on the place, while perusing Yelp reviews from Steel City, and thought it looked promising. I was a little wary about trusting a restaurant tucked into a suburban strip mall but without a better suggestion, I acquiesced .   It had a sparse but inviting decor. I loved the idea of the large Venn Diagram mural in the Lobby \" Do you like burgers? Yes? No?\". This was a weekday around 5pm, so it wasn't at all busy(yet) and we were sat immediately.  I wish I could say that we were visited immediately ( or even within 10 minutes) by a server but it took someone entirely too long to greet us. By the time a server did show, we had already decided on our whole meal.  The menu was short and sweet, which was a plus for me. You can choose from a selection of their specialty burgers or create your own. For my Philly friends, it's very similar to our PYT right down to the spiked shakes.  Their beer selection was tremendous! I chose a Rouge Chocolate Stout on draft , which was 1/2 price for Happy Hour( $3). I was more than pleased.  Our server was pleasant and efficient but nothing special. My biggest problem was that because we ordered all at once, the food came out all at once. We had our apps for all of 2minutes ( without side plates) before the burgers came out. As you can imagine, a loaded burger is messy,we needed extra napkins, and it took her awhile to come back and check on us. While not damning, the service we received keeps this from being a 5star review.  The food was exceptional. We shared onion rings and \" steak fries\" as apps. When the o-rings were dropped down, I thought there was a mistake. I didn't order a plate of cake donuts. Those rings were the biggest and most meaty onion rings I'd ever eaten and they were good. I can think of 2 words wrong with our \" steak fries\" ...\" steak\" and \" fries\". The steak fries are actually portabella mushroom strips, seasoned and lightly battered and I was amazed at how much they actually did taste like steak fries. Another winner.  Again I'll supply my Philly friends with another comparison. Their burgers are comparable with those you can get at The Institute. Same whispy fries, similar bun and burger ratio. Similar great taste. My friend and I both ordered the Morton Steak burger. I was too tired after an exhausting day touring Pittsburgh to choose my own ( the choices are endless, but I like option of the sheet at the table that you can mark off and hand to your server.). The Steak burger had most of what I like anyway, horseradish cheddar, onion straws, a tasty red wine sauce. I thoroughly enjoyed it.  We were stuffed but we had to try a highly recommended shake. I wasn't driving so I chose the Grandads Secret ( caramel+ bourbon...I always suspected this about pop pop) and my friend got the Smores one, complete with a toasted marshmallow on top. We agreed that they were fantastic and I totally appreciated the extra wide straw.  Overall I'd say that it was a great experience and that the good far outweighed the bad. Not sure if this is a chain restaurant ( it seems like one) and if so, they are welcome to penetrate the Philly area. So we were filled up, boxed up, and ready to make the long trip home. I have to say though, that Burgatory didn't occur while we were in the establishment. Burgatory happened about an hour later, with 2 gassy guys locked in a small mini Cooper for 5hours, headed 70mph east. We will never be the same.",

The owners own uncle SAMs next door by now they should have fugues out they aren't getting over flow they should figure out away to use part of uncle dams for burgatory on weekend nights to increase table capacity and finally have the landlord give them permanent outdoor dining. JJ gumberg is too cheap to permanently make their outdoor dining area permanent.  If they left this space JJ could never replace them!!!  Although the food is good a 2 hour wait is obscene I have found many replacements",

This way you don't have to worry about your order coming out wrong (especially if you're a picky eater). Also, there are A LOT of options in case you feel like gettin' a little crazy.   I wasn't a fan of the chips that come with all of the burgers. They were crunchy but had no taste. It's good if you put them in your burger to create a little texture variation. Also, the burger patty was HUMONGOUS! So big that it made it hard to taste the other ingredients in your burger. My gf had the veggie patty and said it had a good taste but was a little mushy (it did end up falling apart as she was eating it).   The Gorgonzola truffle fries were a little too greasy and heavy for me. The herbed fries were delicious!   All in all I would come again but I wouldn't go out of my way or dream about this place.",

They liked their meals, but I did not, and sure enough, not an hour later, I already feel sick. I had the bison burger with Cheddar, mushroom, and the focaccia bread bun. The mushrooms were cold and there were about 10 tiny cheese shreds on the burger... that's all. I asked for and was given a little dish of more cheese, and that was nice, but come on. It's a cheeseburger and I am paying extra for cheese. Put some on my burger. The waitress was very pleasant and the fries were still good, but this time, my burger was SO not worth the way I feel now.",

    "text": "A week or two ago, I posted a small complaint on their facebook page regarding the taste and way they modified the bangkok steak fries since the first time I tried it, three days after their opening.  As you can see from my first review (and picture), the bangkok steak fries didn't have the most picture perfect presentation, but were lightly battered, and fried just right, so that the taste of the mushroom came out and wasn't overpowered by the batter.  after that first time, however, they started overwhelming those poor mushrooms with batter: some of the batter towards the inside wasn't even fried, and part of the batter wasn't even mixed well enough, leaving patches of raw flour, which tasted terrible and, obviously overpowered and destroyed the appeal of the appetizer.  They did answer my facebook post very quickly, offering a complimentary order the next time I went.  Before my next visit yesterday, my friend, who I usually go to Burgatory with, visited the restaurant before I did with his friend, and was pleased to report to tell me that they had reverted back to their original way of creating this tasty appetizer.    when i proudly got to show this pittsburgh establishment off to my girlfriend yesterday evening, we were greeted by the same friendly staff, and very shortly after being seated, by the owner.  he immediately mentioned that he was ready to serve us an order of bangkok steak fries, but was very gracious when I kindly asked whether i could defer it to my next visit (which will be soon, i assure you all).  my girlfriend had ordered a caramel pretzel milkshake, and given how much of my milkshake i could finish the last time i ordered one, i knew that she wouldn't have space in her stomach to enjoy the bangkok steak fries.  the caramel pretzel shake was delicious: as my girlfriend said \"pretzels in a milkshake is genius!\"  be warned though, don't drink it too fast, despite its deliciousness. the pretzel bits can fly down the wrong tube pretty easily.  just savor the flavor. :)  my main reason for giving my 2nd update review for this joint is to mention their supremacy in creating the best \"standard\" burger i've ever tasted.  despite its simplicity in construction - beef patty, crisp iceberg lettuce, tomato, one whole onion slice, and their house sauce which i can only liken to a liquidy version of in n out's \"special sauce\" - the taste of every ingredient comes out so incredibly cleanly and potently.  the strong punch of the onion, the texture of the fresh lettuce and tomato, the milky white american cheese on the perfectly seared-in juicyness of the beef patty. my goodness. i've already ordered this cheapest non-custom burger twice in a row now!  so don't be turned off by the lack of complexity in this burger, assuming that the taste won't be as satisfying as a morty steakhouse. i assure you that you'll be just as satisfied.  my girlfriend also wanted to try the japapeno cornbread; when she ordered it, the waiter asked if she'd like to substitute it in place of her potato chips.  this was only 1 dollar extra.  so if you're not super obsessed with the chips and want to try their other sides, try asking for a substitution, and they may very well allow it!  by the way, the same 1 dollar extra sub works with fries as well.  thumbs up, as always, for great service and great food.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed Burgatory. We came in at about 6:00 on a Friday night, and while it was really busy, we were seated in the time frame that they initially told us we would be.  I had a bison burger on a whole wheat bun with mixed greens, arugula, smoked gouda, onions, whole grain mustard, and bread and butter pickles with the side salad instead of the chips. The burger was incredible, and I was really impressed that the side salad was just as amazing as the burger.  My friends both got the Phat Pattie's Veggie Burger with the fries, which they loved.   We shared two milkshakes among three of us- one peppermint pattie hard milkshake, and one caramel pretzel. Both were divine.  I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Came here because of the raving reviews of friends, and even people I don't know just hearing Burgatory in the conversation. Unfortunately the place did not live up to its hype... At least for me.    I came here with a friend as we were in the area, it was probably around 9 or so and the restaurant was empty, just a few people at the bar watching the Penguin game.  Looked over the menu (obviously getting a burger) looked at the selection and was impressed with the types of meats, decent toppings but not as unique as i imagined they would be.  So i got the \"Meat You Maker\" mostly due to the Wagyu beef. Came out pretty quick, probably because we were the only people eating.  Now there was nothing wrong with the burger (was a bit on the dry and over cooked) but it was not good enough to rave about endlessly like everyone in Pittsburgh loved to do. Asked my companion and she was not wowed either.  Food aside the waitress clearly wanted to get out of there and left the bill a minute after our burgers arrived... Then kept coming around to check if we had paid, even though the restaurant want closing anytime soon.  Overall i give it a 2.5 stars rounded up to 3.  Is it good yes but it is not worth all the hype that is associated with it.",

This will include every little detail you can imagine including the type of meat, rub, etc. If you aren't up to it, I don't think you can go wrong with any of their own burger options.  The milkshakes... you can get them spiked! They are so flavorful and the perfect pairing for your burger. I never seem to be able to finish my burger and a shake, but it will leave your taste buds happy. Now for the 'underdogs', their fried and nacho appetizers are equally as good. My boyfriend and I had gone for shakes and appetizers and that's enough for a full stomach!  All in all there's multiple ways to enjoy your Burgatory experience and not leave disappointed! Enjoy!",

I ordered the \"Meat Your Maker\" burger -- aged wagyu beef (whatever that is) with gruyere cheese and some roasted  tomatoes.  it was big, juicy, and oh so yummy.  Really a great burger.    Cons:  What???? I couldn't get cell reception -- 1/2 a bar and no data connection.... What???? I'm dining solo for gawd's sake.... I'm supposed to be checking emails, FB, etc, etc, etc while waiting on my order.  Argghhhh... good thing that burger was so good.   Oh, and the other con -- I  noticed after I ordered mine medium that servers were asking \"red, pink or no pink\" not \"medium, rare, well done\". Hmmm, my \"medium\" seems to have been translated RED, RED, RED... Ok, I didn't notice unti 3/4 the way thru so seemed pointless to point it out then, especially since if I hadn't noticed, I wouldn't have been worse for wear.  But ooooooh, noticing made the last few bites difficult....   Price for a burger, side of cole slaw, and a soda, plus tip was $22.  A little steep for a burger outing.",

I loved the build your own checklist that had available, but went with the Elk Gone Wild burger!  The presentation of the burger was great and the flavor was even better!  The mixed potato chips served with it had a great crunch and flavor.    I ended with a smores shake and don't believe I could have made a better decision!  The ice cream was extremely creamy and tasty.  If your looking for a good burger in the PIT area, definitely add this place to the top of your list!",

    "text": "\"Honor they burger and they mother.\"...That's the sentiment on the wall at Burgatory, and it's clear they live by it. 'Cause yeah, they honor their burgers there!  Let me start by talking about the Truffle Gorgonzola Fries, because OMG -- they're so freakin' good. The truffle flavor is prevalent, and they don't skimp on the gorgonzola. The serving is fairly large, so if ya wanna finish your burger, you should def split this with someone!   I've gotten the salted caramel pretzel milkshake every time I've gone. It's just one if those things that's so delish, I am not even willing to risk trying something else that may not measure up. The lil chunks of pretzel swimming in the creamy caramel ice cream... Perfection.  All the burgers I've had there have been delish, too. And large. They're big. I haven't finished my burger once.   Oh, and if you're going on a weekend day, be prepared to wait, because you very well may have to -- especially if it's later in the day/evening. But, it's really not so bad because you just give them your cell number, and they text you when your table is ready! Since they're in a plaza, there are stores galore that can occupy your waiting time. (I recommend the TJ Maxx next door!)",

I got the expresso one. my husband the caramel bourbon and the 8 year old got the Smores. The Smores one comes with a roasted marshmallow on top! You get your glass of shake with tons of think, almost Fluff-like whipped cream on top plus the metal container that the shake was made in with all the extra that wouldn't fit in the glass.  My husband got the Farmer Browns' burger and enjoyed it.  I got the Hot Chick sandwich and it was incredible! The perfect combination of flavors and amounts of sauce, cheese, etc. Chicken was perfectly seasoned and grilled.   The Bonus Daughter got the grilled cheese and for an extra $1 (only homemade chips come with the sandwiches) got the fries. She did not care for the fries. The fries were a bit overly salted and also had pepper and I want to say rosemary on them. I loved them but did try to scrape off some salt.  The waitstaff was very friendly and we got to eat in the outdoor covered area. Great spot. Wish we had something like it close to home.",

Sides - fries, union rings (huge), and the potato/sweet potato chips that come with the burgers are good options. We weren't huge fans of the baked beans, a little too spicy and BBQ'y for our liking. By far my favorite topping to get on my burger is the shallot truffle aioli; it is so good I could eat it with a spoon.",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about Burgatory.  I'm the kind of burger fan who has \"bun issues.\"  Issues w the bun, and issues w my own 'buns.'  I really hate it when either set of buns are too large and Burgatory buns are too large, and they make my buns too large as well.  This can easily be solved by ordering your burger open faced, and then cutting the single bun in half.  So many burger places have huge buns.  \"Here's your loaf of bread with beef pattie...\"  Do they do this so you think their burgers are bigger?  I don't know.  One thing I do know is that Burgatory Burgers have NO size issues whatsoever.  They are so huge, you may want to fast for two days before eating at Burgatory.  Or you could be a normal person and take half the burger home but I never have that kind of self control.  The first time I went to Burgatory it was a Wednesday night and i was surprised there was a long wait.  I browsed Barned & Noble for awhile, the strip mall location gives you a lot of options while you are waiting for your table.  One of the things I like about Burgatory is they do have a fairly diverse menu, including vegetarian options that (I hear) are really good.  I ordered what can only be described as the 'Sodium Burger.\"  It had red wine sauce and carmelized onions on it and basically, it tasted like salty onions.  Don't know that I'd order it again.  The beef they use is so nice that I'd urge you to go with a plainer burger.  I'll come right out and say it:  the burgers are just 'meh.'    The kitchen also tends to over cook the burgers so unless you want your burger \"Joan of Arc\" style, order it medium.  Everything here is super salty and I am convinced they do this to sell more beer and it works.  Their beer selection is pretty good.  We also had the truffled french fries and the first few fries were good but the fries were so soaked in truffle oil it became almost inedible after awhile.  Oh, it tasted good, but it was just too rich.  I really think I dislike truffle oil.  ...White people problems...  anyway,  I was *that person* who ordered the mixed veggies at Burgatory and they were awesome.  Roasted red peppers and sugar snap peas.   Whatever you order, make sure you get a milk shake!  I would knife fight my own mother over a Burgatory milkshake, they are that good.  My favorite is the almond torte.  This place isn't cheap, but it's not expensive and they'll give you enough food to feed your family for a week!",

These were delicious; however, the service was awkward. Our server would walk by our table, slowly, as if he was going to check in with us....but would just end up walking away. Lol! I also got to try a milkshake. The amaretto one had good flavor but the texture was off since the pieces of almond were a little large for a drink.

I stopped in for happy hour during the week and was able to sit at the bar and get a burger.  This place serves a great burger - cooked perfectly with the all the right ingredients.    I also ordered the truffle fries on the side (not served with the meal).  I ordered a Banana Milkshake with booze (not sure what it was called - some reason I want to call it Chunky Monkey (Ben and Jerry's) but afraid that I am describing myself sitting at the bar eating a Cheeseburger, fries, truffle fries, and a liquored up Milkshake) - whew I feel the need to do a push-up.  The food was awesome and the milkshake was a novelty to try once.  Even though this will exceed your Weight Watcher points for the year - you MUST try this place.   (I still will not wait for a seat) but it is good to check out for availability.  Food - Burger was awesome - a high recommend Prices - Burger was about $10, overall bill for my little buffet was about $25 - liquor in your milkshake is expensive :-) Service - Awesome - the bartender was great and provided good recommendations and explanations  Enjoy!

    "text": "I've never had a bad meal here. The crazy thing is that the burgers are a close second to their salads. I ordered a salad for takeout one day and after I got back to work and devoured it, I realized they are no joke.  On my most recent visit I had the burger topped with pot roast and gravy. I normally order my burger med rare but here it's red center, pink center or ? In any case, what I received was more leaning towards well done. I'm not going to knock them for that because it was still juicy and had good flavor. The gravy, cheese, onion curls and horseradish cream was the True icing on the cake so to speak and the flavor of the roast was just ahhhhmazing.  I'm not a person who loves fries but I found myself eating all if them here and looking for more...thank God I have girlfriends who share! ;)  The $8 tiny margarita was sooooo tiny but it was refreshing. I enjoyed the fresh juices they used and it was a standout from some of the other margaritas made from prepackaged mixes which are served around the area. I capped off my meal with a nutter butter fluffer (whatchamacallit) shake to go. It was good but I will say the texture of the crushed cookies got to me after a couple sips. I think it could do with less cookie and still be very good. It started to get a bit gritty.  So, why 3 stars? Well, our server was a tad bit tacky. For example, reaching over our foods right in our faces in mid conversation. No excuse me or pardon me and it was weird/awkward. We needed takeout boxes and she put them down in front of my friend on the opposite side of the table and almost took off her face when she did it. The other issue is their floor. It's not just this Burgatory either, I've been to the one in Robinson too and it's the same. It's slippery as heck so don't wear heels. Thank God I didn't wear them today. Even in flats I had to be extremely careful.   It's been over a year since my last visit to Burgatory prior to the other evening. While I can't say I will never visit again, there's nothing making me want to immediately visit again.",

A lively atmosphere, a lot of groups out for lunch on a Friday, and several families with kids like us.  The food was hot, quickly served and the waitress was very helpful and friendly.  I created my own burger and the burger itself was cooked exactly as I like, and the choices for toppings-condiments, cheeses, rubs/coatings-were varied from the basic to the slightly adventurous.  Homemade chips with the burger were good.  Everyone around us had milk shakes and the options on those were interesting and they all looked good.  Looking at the reviews/photos now, wish I would have tried the six napkin nachos-maybe next time!",

A few issues I have encountered at this location was when I was given chewy sweet potato chips that were not the freshest and the long waits.  A 40 minute wait is not something I particularly enjoy, but it's no wonder there is such a long wait because of the variety of milkshakes and burgers!  Other than those issues, Burgatory at The Waterworks has outstanding food paired with great service!",

But sometimes they get it right.  At Burgatory, it's right every time.  As a result it continues to be my favorite \"fancy\" burger place.  I've sampled the Morty's Steakhouse, Elk Gone Wild and created my own creations as well.  I'm never disappointed and appreciate the fact that I know when I go to Burgatory and order a burger cooked medium it will be beautifully delicious.  Fries aren't bad and the onion rings are massive.  I also enjoy the shakes, but mostly I go for the burgers and the homemade chips.    With over 200 reviews, though, I'm not sure mine is really necessary.",

I like how they offer a variety of burgers with different types of protein and you can even build your own burger. I tried the Elk gone wild which was full of flavor, especially with the bacon jam! My husband ordered the Meat your maker, which I thought was equally as good. For an appetizer, we ordered the seoul tacos. It was pretty scrumptious, the meat was so juicy and tender. We also tried the expresso love milk shake, which is great for all the coffee lovers out there! I liked how there were bits and pieces of the coffee bean in the milkshakes so you still have some crunch with the milkshake. Good food and nice lively atmosphere. Would definitely come back to try the other burgers and milkshakes.",

He guided us through the menu and was able to thoroughly answer questions I had about the menu. Moreover, he was friendly and attentive which made dining here a great experience.  Now for the heavenly shakes. I shared the Espresso Love and the Burnt Almond Torte; both were excellent! They were rich and creamy; I'd consider sharing one next time because of how filling they are.  Finally, the burgers. I decided to create my own burger and opted for an elk burger on herb focaccia with bayou Cajun dry rub, arugula, tomatoes, and red onions. I had it cooked to 'red' which is comparable to medium rare; I'd say that it was slightly more rare than most restaurants' medium rare which is great for those of us who enjoy juicy burgers!  If you're going shopping at the Waterworks, then plan on coming here for lunch.",

    "text": "Burgatory is hands down my absolute favorite. For years. Like, I come here for my \"family\" birthday.  Weird.  Oddly, I have never actually had a traditional cow burger from here, but their chicken burgers are a thing of beautiful mystery.  I might be getting carried away, but generally, this place is quick, customizable, and always delicious.  I've never once had a bad time here.  Granted half of the wait staff are disgruntled, leftover-angst-filled kids, but your server will be awesome.  The place itself isn't much, but you're not here for the decor.  It's casual and cool, and what's wrong with that?  You're going to want to do the \"create your own\" option with the little notepads in the center of the table.  Cute, right?  Get one of those tiny pencils and pick anything you could ever want.  Personally, I do the chicken on focaccia with truffle aioli, provolone, arugula, and cucumbers, but that's just me (the pickiest one of them all!).  It gets crazy messy, melty, and for once, there is no amount of (Yelp traditional) hyperbole to explain myself. Most of my dinner partners choose the typical burger or get real crazy with some buffalo or elk.  How do they have buffalo?  I hope that the headcount at South Park hasn't gone down.  I also want to note on the truffle fries; they're greasy, smelly, and SO. GOOD.  It has that awesome truffle gorgonzola aspect of \"this smells like feet, and it's delicious\".  Everyone wants to exclaim about the milkshakes immediately (Prantl's almond torte shake! Booze shakes!), and I know they are incredible, but don't toss your little drink menu aside.  The sangria is more or less a new age hooch of different non-explicit ingredients made in house for which I am typically not brave enough.  The gem is the strawberry shag.  Complete with your strawberry slices and basil, this thing is excessively easy to drink.  It's simple, but always a staple.  The location itself is small, and you cannot make reservations; I have to mention the NoWait app though, as sometimes you can be given up to a two and a half hour wait (I've seen it!). I know it sounds chintzy to get dinner in a strip mall, but this is still my favorite location.  Original is always the best, unless you're creating a burger that is going to be better than anything you can order off any menu.",

The Robinson location might be a little bigger?  The burgers are always good, shakes are amazing, service is good.    I think it's cool how you can make your own burgers and they have wagyu beef, which is delish and if you have an adventurous palate, they also have elk and bison burgers, both of which my fiance said he loved.  He said the elk was lean.  He had it cooked medium and liked it that way.  They also serve them with these homemade chips that are so tasty!  I love the shakes here and they give you both the glass and the ones in the tin, so they give you a lot compared to the ones they serve at brgr.  You can take the rest to go aa long as it doesn't have alcohol of course.  Burgatory hands down beats BRGR at milkshake battle.  My fave is the salted nutella crunch, which they can spike with chocolate vodka.  I'm drooling just thinking about this shake!  The only downside is that they don't take reservations, and it's really crowded around happy hour time to close, One time my friends and I had to wait 2 hours.  We went several times during lunch time at the one in Robinson and never had to wait, but at the Waterworks location, we went on a tuesday afternoon around 1:30 and there was a wait, so luckily the bar had room so we just chose to sit there.  Definitely one of my fave places!",

I ordered my burger pink, with romaine lettuce, tomatoes,grilled onions, and bbq sauce.  The burger was TASTELESS.  Onions were non existent, as was the bbq sauce.  Fries were average. Got a refill on my coke without asking, then was offered a milk shake as a dessert (why oh why didn't I get a menu at all though?).  Don't know what the attraction of this place is.....personally when you walk in and stare at this big walk in freezer staring at you, you figure it is going to be reheated, microwaved crap.  These people figured out how to make it look nice, but it is a far cry from the burgers at the Squirrel Hill Cafe or Tessaros.  Not impressed. And I would hide that walk in cooler if I was designing the room, especially if what I want to eat is FRESH food, not FROZEN.",

My other options are essentially limited to the Whole Foods salad bar and Chipotle (if I'm seeking convenience, cost-efficient, and easy to manage options), and Burgatory is easily the most bang for my buck.  I follow a paleo diet, so navigating main dishes is sometimes difficult. Here, I choose a sustainable source of meat, a lettuce bun, no cheese, and whatever toppings I'd like. I love the option of receiving greens on the side instead of chips. I feel satisfied without having to make two-three substitutions or sacrificing the volume of my food while paying more for extras like guac (i.e. Chipotle).   In my opinion, this is the most health-conscious sit-down restaurant in Pittsburgh, and I'm glad there are multiple locations. I'm a Burgatory addict.

The bread was soft, the beef was seasoned well and made with only top notch all natural good stuff and the maple cured ham adds an extra element of flavor which was unexpected but much appreciated.  The potato chips were pretty good but I know they can do better. Throw some more salt and pepper on those boys and lets call it a day. I read all of my fellow Yelpers talking about the shakes here so I couldn't resist picking up a Fluffer Nutter Butter and its in the running for best milkshake of my life. It is jam packed full of flavor, they actually use cookies to make the shakes legit but the one downside is they need to work on a better consistency so you can actually use a straw without using excessive force.  I got a TO-GO order and it was ready when I got there as expected. They checked me out quickly and the girl who took my order was sweet. If I visit again, I'll be sure to come back and get me a second helping of burger and shake heaven.",

We hadn't been there in months and frankly I'd gotten a little tired of it but acquiesced.    We placed our reservation using NO WAIT app (the very best for Burgatory) and by the time we'd ordered drinks at the bar our table was ready. I really didn't know what I wanted to order so I asked the Excellent server for her suggestion. And the burger she suggested was A-MAZ-ING.  Truly, I told my husband I wasn't going to be able to talk very much because I was taking the time to let the flavors dance on my palate.  I mean it was wonderful.  I don't remember the Name of the burger, but I know the protein was \"50/50\",  that is 50% beef and 50% ground bacon.  And it had a rub on it.  Sorry I can't be of more help there.  But I wanted to write the update in case you, like me, thought you'd had all that Burgatory can offer.  Let me say for the record that they CONTINUE to add new dishes and tastes.

However, much like the Build-a-Bear workshop, having a million options doesn't make a cool looking bear.  It usually ends up with a bear that has a paw where his wang should be, and is dressed like a cross between a policeman, a princess, and the devil himself.  It was my own fault that I built the most structurally challenged burger in the universe, but I feel like our waiter should have stepped in at some point and said, 'just because the toppings are free, doesn't mean you have to put them all on one burger you jack ass.'  One hilarious bite later, and I had squirted every topping I had right into my basket.  This left me with a hang dog expression, and a naked burger.  The burger itself was really good (pepper crusted bison), but my recommendation is give one of the pre-made one's a shot.  Morty's steakhouse was the one that my friend raved about.  We also got the mushroom tempura and some crazy fries, both of which were relatively good, but seemingly had been sitting on the warmer for a pretty long time.  They also have alcoholic milkshakes, but ours were so thick, that it felt like I was being punished for ordering them.  I will definitely go back once the crazy crowds die down to get a better sense of this place.  There really are a ton of burger options to be explored.",

The poutine wasn't that good though I thought, the beef on top and the watery gravy didn't do it for me, especially when the beef had chunks of fat and bone in it. I might come back, but doubt it. For the drive from my house to this place I'd rather drive to Cleveland and eat at BSpot, it's half the price and a better burger in my opinion.",

They are full of all kinds of crazy ingredients and are some wild recipes.  I especially enjoy the burnt almond torte milkshake.  It's made with burnt almond torte from Prantl's, amaretto, and ice cream.  So good!  We tried this at home but it wasn't quite the same.",

I also appreciate that they have a delicious vegetarian burger - it's made mostly of lentils, which I enjoy much more than black beans (most other restaurants do black beans).  The fries are great as well!    The only reason that I give them a 4 instead of 5 is due to their policy on reservations.  We live about a half an hour away, so it's really irritating to drive all the way out to Waterworks only to wait for an hour and a half (seems to be the typical wait time).  Yes it's nice that they have the texting system, but I still think that we would visit more frequently if we could make reservations and be seated promptly.",

And I love it!!! Most delicious burger ever!!! There was a sweet taste with a spicy sensation. Very unique taste!   Also our server was friendly and helpful; however, the service was a bit slow since it was very busy and packed.   Overall, I highly recommend everyone to try this place out.",

    "text": "Best burger I have EVER had.... in a restaurant!!   Atmosphere/decor: (5/5) I LOVE the decor and the whole atmosphere of the restaurant. It was very modern and definitely a place to hang out for any age group.  The crowd is very eclectic which made me like the restaurant more. Its not everyday you would see college kids, a group of little girl blowing bubbles in their milkshakes, biker dudes, and super old people in the same restaurant and none of them look out of place. I was kind of upset when I found the place because I'm in Aspinwall all the time and I never noticed Burgatory before. It was like a hidden treasure. Now I understand why Barnes and Noble's parking lot is always full! You know that feeling when you realize you are the last one to find out something... that's how I feel right now! lol     Service : (5/5) Initially it took a while for our waiter to take our orders but that was because of a mistake he made with another table. Even though he couldn't help us right away, another waitress was there to order our drinks and he kept checking in just to let us know that he wasn't neglecting us. After the problem was resolved, he was SUPER attentive. Our food took longer than expected but that was my fault... I ordered my burger VERY well done a.k.a burnt. lol   Random but I also like to add that pretty much all the staff were very pretty/handsome... kudos to the hiring manager. My waiter was ridiculously attractive but he was gay so I didn't feel guilty for staring instead of listening when he was talking to us. lol I swear if Brad Pitt had a brother it would be him! Ok, I'm done...  Food: (5/5) First of all they had there own style of fries which was great! They sprinkled garlic salt over the top of them. I absolutely hate thick burgers but this was definitely an exception. I got the custom burger  - hormone free beef ( the name kinda gross me out), avocado, pickles, lettuce, apple? bacon, and Cajun rub. The seasoning of the burger was excellent! It taste like a burger I would have at a bbq. It really made me curious what the other seasonings taste like. They put several pieces of thick bacon on the burger so that was great.   My husband got the special which was a ANTELOPE burger! My husband likes eating strange meat so he was very excited about it. He loved it! Any place that is able to put antelope meat, blue cheese, beets, herbs(instead of lettuce) together and make it taste good is 5 stars worthy in my book.   Oh yea... I really want to go back for a milkshake because they looked amazing!",

I didn't quite enjoy my Morty's Steakhouse burger... I prefer simpler burgers with no condiments where you can really taste the meat. The meat itself was perfectly pink and juicy but I didn't like that the bottom bun was soaked with grease. Also wasn't a big fan of the Haystack Onions (I've had better onions that style, from Flour in Boston). Overall, it was fat overload, especially with the shake.  I would like to try a custom creation next time, without any sauces or fancy toppings (and no shake - that thing is a meal of its own!) I actually enjoyed the cracked peppercorn rub a lot - flavorful without being overpowering - and I'm curious about the other rubs, too.",

I made my own burger and it was delicious, but I have to say I'm about to rave about my drink and side much more.  My friends and I started the night with milkshakes. Maybe we should have saved them for desert (they were more like a meal to themselves), but these milkshakes were delicious. I went for the spiked Monkey Business shake. I love anything banana, but I was pleased from the whipped cream down to the subtle, but definitely there, flavor of rum.   My absolute favorite part of the meal, however, were the truffled gorgonzola fries. Could there be a better combination of flavors than truffle oil and gorgonzola cheese? Oh yes. Add fries. Amazing.  The burger I created was a thing of beauty as well. I think next time (and I sure hope next time is soon) I'll go with a combination created on the menu to see what they really have up their sleeves.",

    "text": "So apparently the whole gourmet burger and milkshake thing is a NYC fad that's trickled it's way down to Pittsburgh. Though as far as food fads go, I hope Burgatory can manage to stick around after the hype has moved on to artisanal Russian butcher shops or whatever.   As a vegetarian, I can say that Burgatory has some of the best veggie burgers is Pittsburgh. And since I do eat seafood (which technically makes me a pescatarian) I can also vouch for their crabcake burgers.   The menu does have a few pre-planned burgers, but you can also build your own with a choice of burgers, buns, spice rubs, cheeses, toppings, and sauces. And considering the size of these burgers, Frankenstein's monster is not an inappropriate analogy.   And last but far from least are the milkshakes. Each a meal unto itself, and the boozed-up shakes packing a heck of a whallop, these should not be attempted solo without an iron gut and a designated driver. But one sip and you'll be hesitant to share this nearly perfect blend of booze and house-made ice cream.  This is not a diet friendly establishment, but if you're going to cheat on Jenny Craig a bit, Burgatory is the place to do it.  Pro Tip: Spring for the the french fries in place of the normal side of chips. Totally worth it.",

They have their own creations but  if your not feeling it, create your own burger. You choose how you want it cooked. These burgers are just plain juicy, flavorful and worth the price. Popular place it seems and great spot for lunch. Didn't try the shakes but they look awesome and you can choose from alcohol or non-alcohol shakes. Friendly waiters and nice atmosphere.

    "text": "Wow. If I were a burger joint around here, this would be my biggest fear.  If you ask anyone that knows me, I am an incredibly fast eater and I always have been with any food. Not these burgers.   After constructing the burger from the extensive list of toppings, buns, and meats I anxiously waited for the food to come. I have heard many things about this place From co-workers and friends so I had slightly high hopes, Wow.  I had no idea that all of their food was made on the premises from burgers to ice cream but boy can you tell. Each bite of the burger screamed fresh and tasty and I didn't even get to the milkshake yet. After the first bite of my burger I actually sat back and looked at the burger to try and take in the flavor. The Peppercorn rub ads some hell of flavor that I haven't experienced with other burgers, it made me ashamed to think that Five Guys burgers were so good.  As for the milkshake, I have to disclaimer this with the fact that I am a milkshake connoisseur and very picky about my milkshakes to the point that I cannot stomach the garbage that place like DQ and Chic-Fil-a try to pass off as shakes. The milkshakes here are incredible. Due to the ice cream being homemade they are real milkshakes tithe core and you can taste that with every sip of the shake. I got the s'mores shake and it was the tastiest drink I can remember having in a long time.  My only fear for this restaurant is the fact that the menu and customer service are so top notch I will find myself here very frequently and my future potbelly is a scary thought. It would be very difficult for me not to recommend this joint as a place every Pittsburgher and tourist should visit; in fact I condone the notion that every Pittsburgher should try a price of this amazing Hometown delight. Every aspect of the meal was nailed and executed perfect. Careful of a wait but come hungry and you won't be disappointed. Be prepared to make a second trip due to the extensive menu to make sure you get the best that Burgatory has to offer.",

    "text": "I just docked a star from my review of BRGR.   There's a new sheriff in town, and he's telling BRGR to suck it.   My brain is still spinning from so much awesome, so I'm going to have to enumerate everything I love about Burgatory.   1. Someone at Burgatory stole my iPod and hit 'shuffle'. I spent as much time singing along as I did chatting with my friends. Either my taste is becoming progressively more mainstream as I get older or there are some very cool (and aggressively non-hipster, I hope) people in charge of the music.  2. Spiked milkshakes. Spiked Milkshakes. SPIKED MILKSHAKES. Heavens, what was I thinking when I foamed at the mouth over BRGR's? I wasn't thinking. I hadn't yet experienced Burgatory's Apple Pancake and Bacon shake. Did you absorb all the Awesome in that shake's name? Again: Apple. Pancake. Bacon. There's also alcohol in there, but it's almost secondary to the chunks of apple and bacon floating in the heavenly swirls of Happy. The whipped cream tasted homemade and worked surprisingly well with the slice of bacon (A SLICE OF BACON!) adorning the side of the glass. Oh, heavens. I'm having heart palpitations just thinking about how amazing it was. My friends' milkshakes were equally swoon-worthy: the bourbon and caramel soaked Grandad's Secret and the rummy banana goodness of Monkey Business.    3. The menu burgers were insanely creative, and unlike BRGR, you can create your own masterpieces. A little gouda here, some Kona rub there; Cabernet sauce here, applewood bacon there. The possibilities are endless... and DELICIOUS. The only area Burgatory seems to fail is with well-done burgers. A little too dry. But not enough to take away from the overall experience. And even if the burgers totally sucked, the milkshakes would've made up for it. Seriously. I would go to the restaurant just to drink myself into ice-creamy oblivion.   Word of warning: because Burgatory is still in its infancy, it gets packed very, very quickly. We waited over 75 minutes for our seats. And every minute was worth it.",

We started with the Strawberry Basil Shag cocktail (dangerously smooth and not too sweet) and then moved onto Brandon's secret small batch sangria; they were both delicious and, surprisingly, both complemented the burgers well.  We both chose to build our own burger. This was unlike any other custom creation experience- starting with your choice of meat, bread (or naked, if you prefer to eliminate those pesky post-holiday carbs), RUB (try the angel dust- a mix of garlic, salt, and pepper), gourmet cheese (horseradish cheddar was subtle but delicious) and sauce (mmmm truffled shallot aioli), I was able to build the beefy delicious concoction of my dreams!I If you're a beef lover, the dry aged wagyu served pink is amazing:)  Although I love some of the other Burger Staples in the Burgh, I think Burgatory tops it for me :)",

    "text": "i had been waiting sooo long to come here after i saw a friend post a picture of their gorgonzola fries, and alas! the time had finally come. well... after an HOUR AND A HALF / HOUR AND FORTY-FIVE MIN wait to be seated. (you'd think they'd learn to either take reservations or expand by now).  well, at least after getting a table, i'm happy to say that burgatory definitely did not disappoint (and i definitely went  home in a massive food coma).   ordered the onion rings & gorgonzola fries to start / on the side. boyfriend ordered their crabcake sandwich & i made my own bison burger. the gorgonzola fries were heavenlyyy. the onion rings were also thick and crunchy, though i would probably hold off on ordering them next time and save room for a shake (which i heard are quite delectable).  and of course, i enjoyed both the crabcake and bison burgers.   took the side chips in a to-go box. still crunchy and delicious the next day. can't wait to come back here, though i'll probably try to come on  a tuesday afternoon or something.",

(Burger purgatory= Burgatory LOLOL) and the waitresses were really nice. The wait was super long though-- I think an hour and a half. But the food was definitely definitely worth it. Soo good. You can customize a burger exactly how you want it! I'm coming here again!",

Finally decide to build my own.  A custom burger. Can't wait. fill out the form. 5. Waitress stops back to see if we are ready. 6. Not quite ready.  Order drinks. 7. Finish my build your own...decisions, decisions, decisions. 8. Waitress brings drinks and takes our order.  Grabs my Custom Creation sheet and she is off. 9. Not to long and our burgers come out.  Mouth watering scrumptious looking. 10. Start eating.. this is one of the best burgers I have had in years.  Good beefy flavor, Yum, Nice rub flavors from the rub and other creations that I choose including cheese and condiments...Yum! 11. Waitress stops by to see if done or if we need anything.  Most are still enjoying our burgers. 12. Waitress stops by to check. 13. Still enjoying my burger. 14. Waitress stops by to check. 15. Still enjoying my burger. 16. Finally finish.  It was sooooo gooooood I took my time to savor the flavor.  The burger was beautifully cooked, juicy and flavorful.  The chips that came with were very good.  Love the options for Custom Creation.  So many choices so little time to eat!",

    "text": "Four of us went during the first few days this restaurant opened. we ordered the fries (delicious, with rosemary and salt) and each ordered a burger. I had the steakhouse which has a red wine sauce and was really very good it came as I ordered medium well. The other three people who were in our party all had a problem with the way the burgers were cooked. Everyone else's were too overcooked, my parner's burger was cooked to a crispy well done even though she had ordered it medium.   Our waitress was happy to send my partner's burger back and have it made correctly. Our waitress also seemed very nervous and seemed on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  Overall I liked my own burger but was unimpressed that 3 our of 4 burgers that were ordered at our table were cooked incorrectly. I will likely not be going back to this restaurant. I felt it was also a little overpriced.   For a great burger I will continue to go to Tessaros",

Considering their portion sizes, you can fill up real quick and have to pay almost nothing for it! We had the nachos, truffled Gorgonzola fries, a strawberry shag and a few drafts.

We have never had to wait and our last visit together was perfect to \"wait\" for the start time for a movie we wanted to see on a rainy day. The portabella mushroom (Bankok Steak Fries) appetizer is great and our daughter, who is not a big fan of mushrooms, likes these. My wife and daughter have created their burgers each time. They have gotten shakes both times and I got one this last visit...it was one named after the Samoas girl scout cookie and was very good. I have ordered MORTY'S STEAKHOUSE burger both times and enjoyed it both times. Sha got the smores shake this time and it was great. The large marshmallow on top could used as a pillow ;). We all look forward to our next visit.",

It was a Saturday afternoon and this placed is tucked away in the corner of a very busy strip mall. It took us about 10 minutes driving up and down the aisles until someone left to park. It was well worth it. It was packed when we walked in, however, we quickly grabbed 2 seats at the bar. The decor was really nice. We of course ordered burgers. I liked the fact that the beef is grass fed. There is a difference. The choice of building your own was incredible. We got pretty creative. One of the best burgers I've had!! Also liked the beer selection, sorry, I don't do shakes. We recommended it to some of our friends who were in town for the same event. They thought is was awesome as well. Our server/bartender was great. She answered every question we had. Well informed. Thanks for the meal. We will be back.",

Love all the different shakes and the flavor twists!  My son tried the mini-cheeseburgers and LOVED them.  I had a bite and was very impressed how the kids burger tasted - not a dried out round orb that they normally serve to children.  Burgers were cooked perfectly as requested.  Loved that you could build your own burger with really different options.  This will be our go-to dinner spot from now on!",

    "text": "I really like this place.  As a vegetarian, I've only had a couple of items on the menu:  the veggie burger and the portabello mushroom sandwich and both were excellent.  The latter comes with a side salad of mixed greens including arugula and roasted tomatoes with a really intense flavor that are to die for.  The portabello sandwich is very nicely seasoned and grilled and comes on a foccacia bun so you can't hate that. We shared a milkshake -- it was big enough for two but I probably could have had one to myself -- that was sweet and salty as it had crushed up pretzels in it -- very tasty indeed. It is the new \"hip\" place in Waterworks so there is usually a line but they will take your cell phone number and send you a text when your table is ready.  They usually over-estimate the wait by a significant amount (we've never had to wait nearly as long as they said.) A warning about the chairs at the tables and the flat tops:  I found them to be extremely uncomfortable.  Try to get a booth, if you can.",

    "text": "Finally! I made the trek out to Burgatory for what is supposed to be one of the best burger experiences in Pittsburgh. This place has what it takes to be the best but our meal fell a little short.   We had to wait 45 minutes to be seated, I have no problem because they have a bar with some great beer choices at reasonable prices. What I did have a problem with was that they use a computer based system that will text you what your wait time is once you arrive and give them your telephone number. I waited exactly 45 minutes until I received a text that my table was ready. Not 40 or 50 minutes but exactly 45 minutes which is what I was told by the waitstaff upon arrival. I find that interesting, is it a scam to get you to go to the bar and spend more? Something to think about. The few wines they offer(2) they will pour a generous $6 glass.  Once we were seated at one of their high top tables. We were sweating our tails off because they had the garage door entrance to the patio area wide open. It is 95 degrees out and if I wanted to dine outside I would have asked to be seated in the patio area or stayed home and grilled my own burger. The burger was A-OK for this reason, way overcooked. Was by no means moist or juicy. It did have overall good flavor but, to have a truly awesome burger int needs to be both seasoned properly and also show that some skill and care was taken to actually heat that hunk of meat to perfection. The ingredients burgatory have are obviously top notch but honestly what's the point if you cant cook the the meat properly.   Service at Burgatory was very quick and my order accuracy outside of the burger being overcooked was right on.  Will I make the trek back out to Burgatory? Probably not but I will stop by if I'm in the area and there isn't a wait.",

If you go and there is a wait, don't fret, you can always go shopping since it is in a strip mall or you can chill by the magazine racks in Barnes & Noble so the time goes by fast!
