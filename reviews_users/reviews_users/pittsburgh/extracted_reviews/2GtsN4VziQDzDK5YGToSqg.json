    "text": "An interesting old building - it was once a brothel! - from the outside it looks tacky, with signs all along the road causing local cyclists to swerve out in to the road to get past. It tries to be upscale - it says on its web site that it's in Fox Chapel, a posh area, but it's actually not, it's in the next township along. Lying to make yourself sound good is never a good start. However, the prices reflect that they think they're a cut above. Some friends got as far as the door and decided against those prices. The room on the right as you enter used to be, under previous owners, a nice place to sit and chat and have a drink. Now it's crowded with inappropriate tables.  Staff were OK - neither good nor bad. We started with the flatbread which was fine but too much. I ordered Grilled pork tenderloin, balsamic apples and carmelized onions with mashed potatoes and broccolini. Thought it sounded mellow and autumnal. When it came I couldn't taste any of the flavors because it was so highly spiced. I told the waitress that it should have said on the menu that it was quite fiery. She shrugged and said that was how it came. My husband's dish was fiery too but it had said it had pepper so he expected that. As someone else has said, the music was bad and intrusive - and really unnecessary. Not hurrying back.",

    "text": "My family had dinner last Thursday night at Andora.  We have liked the ambiance and location of this local historic restaurant in visits under previous ownership.  We were disappointed with the food.  My surf and turf was bland all around and the meat was rare not medium-pink as requested, my son's sauteed chicken breast with sherry gruyere sauce should have been much more flavorful and all of the food could have been presented better.  My husband wasn't particularly impressed with his filet mignon and my daughter didn't comment about her pork tenderloin but took most of her dinner home.  The appetizers, however, were delicious (flatbread, calamari--nice and light and not overdone, zuccini ribbons) and we all agreed that the best way to experience this restaurant is probably with drinks and appetizers in the cozy social room near the bar with a fireplace.  The quality of the entrees did not live up to the price.  The service was adequate.  Our server was willing to take my steak back but I preferred to bring the rare portion home to heat up as leftovers.  Also, the hot tea served was an inexpensive bland brand rather than the Tazo or comparable better quality teas served at most restaurants of this level.",

Unfortunately, the food was not anything extraordinary, and definitely not worth the price. The asparagus salad sounded so delicious on menu but when it arrived it was underwhelming and I couldn't even taste the lemon honey dressing on it. The main entrees (especially the fish dishes) were under seasoned. Few of their dishes were delicious though, and if you plan on visiting I would suggest the Andorra chicken (probably their best dish), from the appetizers - shrimp in Thai coconut red curry sauce, lobster mac n cheese and the shrimp bisque.",

When we arrived, the entire staff was standing in the parking lot because no one had a key to get into the restaurant. Then, my kids and I watched as a waiter took a large rock and broke a glass window to the kitchen and climbed in to let us all in. He then had to continue the day serving with bandages on his arms from getting cut. As a result of no one having a key, nothing was ready and no food was prepped. My family member who planned the party was even asked to reschedule her party (as the guests, who came from hours away, had already arrived).  The wait staff was helpful and apologetic but the food took entirely too long, since nothing was prepared prior. Half of the guests were kids and were complaining that they were starving. Then...the kids meals didn't even come out before the adults' meals did. The food, which is typically their strong suit, was sub par. Burgers were burnt to a crisp and were brought out well after the other adults had almost finished their meals. To top it all off, we were over charged after having the whole menu/prices pre-planned with the staff! All in all it was an extremely disappointing experience and the whole thing was very poorly managed. This used to be a favorite place to visit but we will not be returning.",

Last week the seared tuna appetizer was cold in the middle. It is obviously purchased pre-prepped and frozen. This week I tried the calamari. It tasted like it was also taken from the freezer and put into the deep fryer.  They came out luke warm in the middle. The Chile sauce was something straight out the bottle that they probably purchased atrRestaurant Depot or from Sysco Foods. The people next to me sent their scallops back to the kitchen because they too were cold. I really want to like this place but the consistently sub standard food makes it impossible. I like the physical space but I think may be limited to the salads.",

The smashed potatoes were cold and dry. I was very disappointed, as I had hoped to treat Mom to a really special meal. Instead, she had to gnaw her way through overcooked and undercooked food. I had previously had lunch here and had an excellent salad, so I may try again. But Mom won't go back.",

She told us that the pork entree had been a recurring problem (clearly the issue isn't the pork) and she offered us free desert. It was as if we were eating at a family buffet instead of a nice restaurant. It was noteworthy that the manager was busy hanging coats and hauling firewood, but didn't have the time or inclination to take care of customers or deal with real issues at the restaurant.  Afterwards, an attempt to tell her that we had recommended Andora to many people and discuss our displeasure was met with a debate. We can't in good conscience recommend this restaurant any more.

A restaurant I haven't tried? Sign me up! The location is a bit different, as it appears to be in the middle of a neighborhood and if you aren't looking for it, you may just drive right past it. It looks like a house! They have a beautiful outdoor dining area that I am completely smitten with. It's quiet, cozy, and has a water feature and fire pit for the evenings!  Their lunch menu has a little bit of everything but I settled on the lobster roll. It was divine! I asked for a side of coleslaw instead of fries, but the coleslaw left a bit to be desired and didn't have much flavor. I picked a few fries off of my coworker's plate and good lord are they good! Definitely getting the fries next time!   Service was great and they even fulfilled my coworker's request for a beet salad, which isn't on their lunch menu but it IS on their dinner menu. I left here pleased with my meal and overall experience. Prices range from $6 (soups) to $15 for lunch items that range from salads to sandwiches and a few entree choices as well!",

When we arrived for our 6pm reservation we were told that we would be seated upstairs.  When my mom told the hostess that  she reserved a downstairs table she was told that they overbooked and if we wanted to sit downstairs we would have to wait until 9pm.  By the time I made it up the stairs I was exhausted and ready to go home.  While our waiter was very nice, the kitchen was unable to accommodate my dietary needs.  We knew that I wouldn't be able to order off the main menu but the plan was that I would order a baked potato.  Apparently they do not serve baked potatoes but offered mashed potatoes.  When we asked why I could not get a baked one, the waiter whispered the the mashed potatoes were powdered.  In a restaurant of this caliber I would have expected the potatoes to actually be real potatoes.   My mom and grandmother ordered the salmon which was overcooked and rubbery.  The only highlight of the night was that my aunt ordered the ahi tuna and she said it was prepared excellently.  Needless to say we won't be returning.",

Can't remember the name of the guy who helped me, but I explained that I was trying to treat my lady to a nice romantic evening. He immediately suggested sitting outdoors and that he would make sure i got a table by the fire. And he delivered! The table was perfect, literally right by the cozy fire. This service alone earned my praise. The restaurant is set in an old building up in the rolling hills of Ohara/Fox Chapel, so for us urbanites it is remote and rural-feeling while still be close to the city.   The dinner was very good. I had the seafood linguine, which comes with shrimp and spicy sausage. The shrimp was very fresh and delicious. My girlfriend raved about her salmon and her Moscow Mule was excellent.   All around excellent. Will be back for sure.",

    "text": "We have been there many times before with experiences going from decent to good.  Our most recent visit was unfortunately horrible. Reservations at seven, seated at 7:15 and ordered appetizers and drinks shortly thereafter.  The appetizers showed up quickly and we're good, but one hour later the manager stopped by and asked what we were waiting for and we told her we are waiting to order dinner.  The waiter showed up soon after and apologized and took our order but it was almost another hour until dinner showed up.  And when it did they only brought three of four dinners.  The fourth dinner didn't arrive for another 15 or 20 minutes.  My Ahi tuna was flavorless and cold, the other dinners were Ok, but 3 of us were done eating before the 4th dinner showed up. The waitress then said that we'd get free desserts, but we were full and didn't want any - to which she replied that we had to have one or she wouldn't \"be able to sleep tonight\". So we ordered a dessert to share 4 ways.  When they delivered the dessert I asked for a coffee with Frangelico, which took too long again and when it showed up it was a cup of coffee with no cream or sugar and a snifter of Frangelico - not at all what I wanted (which was a coffee drink) and her answer was to bring me another coffee - to split the Frangelico between - and then charged me for both, despite the horrible service, offer for free dessert that we didn't want, and the lousy service.   We left there and went to another place - ran into another couple who coincidentally was at the table next to us - and we all agreed that it was the worst experience at Andora ever.  And they had a different waitress - so that at least wasn't the whole issue - beyond disappointing!  We were trying to take friends out for a nice dinner who have been having a hard time - and by the end of the night we could only laugh about how bad things had been.  Over 3 hours total for dinner, with LONG gaps in the middle...",

Definitely a place I would feel comfortable having a formal dinner in as well as drinks after work.  The outdoor patio isn't open yet (still too cold), but it looks great and I would definitely want to come.  2). Service:  4 stars. We sat at the bar.  The bartender was very attentive and personable.  The hostess was accommodating when we came in.  No complaints.    3). Food:  2.5 stars.  When everyone in the room -- including strangers-- laughs and comments on the appearance of your food when it comes out, there is a problem.  I had the fried eggplant.  It was ridiculously huge and ultimately not attractive .  It was piled on top of a giant pile of pasta that was overcooked.  Didn't taste good.  Not a winner.  Much of the food was kind of over large and not presented well.  Overall, a good place for drinks and outdoor seating.  Will try the food again in the hopes they work it out.",

I like to think of myself as a bisque pro. But this was not really a bisque. It was way to oily. You had to stir it each time as not to have an entire bite of oil. You could even see the separation of oil and cream. The shrimp were small but ok.   I had the crab cakes which were great but a little on the smaller side. But the mashed potatoes and veggies were delicious. Plus the plate was filled with them helping to fill the plate.   Had a nice plate of Pinot noir which was a house choice.   Also had a brownie dessert which was amazing.   Overall a great dining experience and looking forward to going back.",

The food is eh but the old Cross Keys building is nice and close to home.   The last time we were there we ordered a dish to go for our daughter.  When we got home we realized they screwed it up and sent us the wrong thing.  We called but didn't want to go back so they sent us a gift certificate for $25.  Ok great.   My wife left it in her wallet for like a year then finally decided to order a couple of lunches to pick up.  She went in to pay, presented the gift certificate (who uses old fashioned gift certificates anymore?) and someone from the kitchen came flying out saying the gift certificate was expired, even though it didn't have any date on it and said \"to be used anytime\".  The jerk argued with my wife for around five minutes and even claimed that she might have STOLEN the certificate.  All this for a $25 lunch that probably cost them $2 worth of food.  The finally relented when my wife refused to back down (good for her ) and basically pushed the bags at her and stormed away.  Not only is this guy a jerk but a moron as well.  Who treats customers like that and chases away business, especially with average food.  Nobody is busting down the doors to get in there as it is.   We will find another place,",

However the staff were friendly and answered our questions. We had a baby with us. They do have high chairs. The textures and spicing of the entrees was creative.

As it turned out, it seemed like our waiter was also working at the bar and we only got to see him at certain times.  When the food finally arrived, the sides on the plates were not correct but we decided not to say anything.  Finally at the end of the meal we were asked if we wanted refills on our drinks.....no thank you we are finished.

She really liked the sole, it was simple and nicely done and the sauce that went with it made it fantastic.  I had the green salad and the ahi tuna, mainly because I wanted the Brussels sprouts!  However both salad and tuna were good, the tuna was rare as advertised and nicely done.  I had a glass of white wine which was good, she had their version of an Old Fashioned, which she liked very much.  The ambiance was great, historic hotel as others have stated.

    "text": "Andora was just ok for me which was disappointing given the price tag on our meal.  I made reservations for Father's Day this past weekend for 5pm and when we showed up, the place was nearly empty.  The interior is nice and classy and the patio is beautiful. Our server, Patrick, was really accommodating and nice and it made for a great experience.  I ordered the crab cake dish, my dad had the seafood pasta, my mom had Andora chicken and my brother had the special which was a surf and turf with filet topped with sauce and crab, a crab cake and sides.  We started with the rolled zucchini, shrimp bisque and fresh baked bread.    My brother ordered the filet medium rare. It came out completely well done - brown all the way through.  While he is not one to complain or send food back, we did end up mentioning it to the server and he was quick to remedy the situation and have a new steak brought out for him.  We were already there for an hour and 15 minutes at this point, and the new steak took another 20.  This time, the steak came out bloody and raw in the middle.  At a $56 price point (the price was not mentioned at the time of hearing the specials and we only saw it on our final bill), I would expect the chef be able to cook a proper piece of filet.  Everyone had finished their meals, so my brother just boxed his food up to take home and said he would heat it the rest of the way through later.  Other than that, my side of veggies was unseasoned and the rice pilaf was just fine.  My parents enjoyed their food and our apps were good.  I probably wouldn't order the bisque again.  Overall, I think there are better places to have a dinner, but I wouldn't be opposed to come back and have drinks and apps on their pretty patio. Plus, it is close to home for me.",

    "text": "I found a coupon on Living Social for this restaurant which is near to our home. Hadn't been in years, probably decades (since it was Cross Keys). And, after our recent meal, won't be going back. I had the crab & lobster pappardelle. My husband had a chicken dish with grilled corn. The meat in my dish had little or no taste. Probably from frozen. The pieces of lobster were like biting through styrofoam. I couldn't taste the crab although I could see the pieces. The sauce was good. May have been from a jar but it was good. I asked our server for pepper. She brought me the shakers like you'd find in a diner, not fresh ground or cracked. The chicken on my husband's plate was small, thin and dry. Looked like it was from a Lean Cuisine microwave dinner. He didn't go into details but said it was not very good.  Our ticket: two glasses of house wine, two draft beers, the calamari appetizer (we were hungry; my hub hadn't eaten since breakfast) and our two entrees. Our total bill after the $30 coupon and including tip was $85. ??!! Will not be returning to Andora.",

    "text": "Very disappointing visit. Seated in the Library. Larry was our waiter. A very good guy, just significantly over worked. Larry is responsible for the bar service as well as customers in the Library. WAY TOO MUCH! Impossible to provide expected service. We are talking about an upscale venue! This establishment is like going to a \"pot luck\" dinner. You just don't know how things will turn out. At times very good, at other times a near disaster. Last night a big bill but VERY SAD SERVICE and food quality. NOT WORTH THE RISK. We love this place but the risk is TooGreat. There are more reliable venues. Try Hartwood restaurant, very consistent food quality and customer service.",

As stewards of an historic building with beautiful interiors and with a reputation for good food, what gives with the tacky town signs????? Ok we get it, you have gift cards available!!! I pass by this place every day on my way to work and couldn't believe what I saw! One or two signs would certainly do the trick. What a shame! Take a lesson from The Hartwood restaurant or il Pizzaiolo and get your class back.",

My girlfriend and me were at the bar after dinner talking about the economy and how I've been able to hire an employee and how my girlfriends retirement gained thousands in a week thanks to the economy under President Trump and Deb who was listening verbally lashed out out at us in front of all the bar patrons and called me an idiot etc etc. The conversation got pretty heated. She needs to be unemployed #1 because she should keep her mouth shut and #2 because she has no respect. She likes her free healthcare that us republican business owners provide. She should have been fired on the spot and had I not been paying with gift certificates the bill should have been credited.   I will be calling the management in the morning. If she's working go elsewhere.",
