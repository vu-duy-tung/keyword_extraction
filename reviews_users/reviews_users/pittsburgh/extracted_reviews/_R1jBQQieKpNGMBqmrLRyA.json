    "text": "I just don't understand how this restaurant had such good reviews. I went with 4 colleagues (one of whom is my wife) tonight (Wed. night) and just about everything about this place was terrible.    We were originally a party of 10, but due to a whole lot of problems, we went down to 5. We told the restaurant ahead of time, but somehow they still put us at a large table for 10. No one could hear each other talk. Half the restaurant was empty and we asked them to move to a smaller table but they said they were all reserved. After enough complaining, they moved us, and not a single one of the tables filled up at any point during our meal (we, more or less, closed down the restaurant side of Nola).   We ordered red wine which came hot. Not warm. Hot. We trudged through the first bottle figuring this was a fluke, but when the second bottle came, we had to ask to put it on ice for a while to cool it down. Where are they keeping these, by the oven?  The appetizers were actually okay. The fried artichoke was tasty and the lamb ribs were flavorful. The raw oysters however were chewy and bland...a sure sign of them not being fresh at all.  No one liked their entrees. I had the Creole Tartiflette and it was way too creamy. Imagine a big bowl of heavy cream with some potatoes in it. That's the Creole Tartiflette. My wife had the scallops, which the waitress pushed. Imagine bland Mac & Cheese with 4 scallops on top. Two people got the jambalaya which was nothing special. And one person got something else, which I can't recall right now.  For dessert we had the bread pudding, which was okay and the beignets. Has the chef ever been to New Orleans? The beignets were tough, not soft and fluffy like they should be. They clearly left them in the deep fryerfor a bit too long.  This restaurant failed. If you want the New Orleans experience, buy a plane ticket and skip Nola.",

We had explored a lot of the city at this point, and had enjoyed several great restaurants and bars. Nola took the cake.   The place was beautiful. Different. Alive and cozy at the same time.   Everyone's food was delicious.   The cocktail list was to die for! I had the New Orleans Milk Punch, which I still talk about, and one of the hot drinks a bartender had recommended. I forget the name, but I believe it had: Brandy, Grand Marnier, Cacao, Cinnamon, and Butter?! It was fantastic.  The servers and bartenders were wonderful and kind.   And the manager was dressed to the nines when he came by our table to check on us and thank us for coming in.   We return to Pittsburgh the first week of December. I will definitely be visiting again.",

Eat at Nola's but save your $$$ on dessert pick this up elsewhere (dunkin doughnuts next door would be better)!!!",

    "text": "We tried this spot over Memorial Weekend. The waitress was very friendly and described the menu thoroughly. In her words, this was cajun creole inspired food \"with a Pittsburgh twist.\" I'm not exactly sure what that means, but I think that gets them off the hook with some of the Bayou Purists here.  We tried the frog legs and fried artichoke appetizers. I really enjoyed the frog legs, but I'm not much of an artichoke guy. I had the gumbo for a soup course while my mom and wife had salads that looked fresh and green.  For the main course I had the shrimp and grits. The shrimp had nice size, texture, and flavor. The whole dish came together well.  For dessert, I ordered the beignets.  These beignets were heavier or more dense than I was used to.  I did not enjoy them as much as I have at the famed Cafe du Monde, or even at a local church fair. However, even bad beignets are still pretty good.   We were seated near the kitchen, so it provided some nice entertainment and distraction as we waited. We took our meal very slow, enjoyed some drinks, and ordered each course individually.  We were waiting for a friend and never felt rushed by the staff -- but weren't ignored either.  I like their mixture for the hurricane cocktail. The fresh juices add a lot.   The bar scene up front was very busy and very loud, but it is quieter in the back and more fit for conversation.  The bar crowd was young, hip, and attractive.  They have valet parking; I think it might even be complimentary, if I remember correctly.",

    "text": "I guess this place is still working out the kinks. I took my parents here on a Saturday night for a delicious Cajun fiesta and left wanting more. They were out of three signature cocktails (Sazerac, Creole Julep and Le Bon Temps Roule) and the service was friendly yet glacial. I realize they are relatively new but I don't get how you can be 'out' of cocktails on a Saturday night. I settled on a Hennessy Sidecar which was slightly watered down but still delicious.  As for the food, the appetizers were alright. We started with the fried artichokes and Pissaladiere flatbread. While the artichokes were divine, the flatbread left something to be desired. Despite the rich ingredients it tasted bland and lacking. I was also seeing a LOT of black, charred edges on the flatbreads that hit the other tables. There's a difference between a bit of burn and way too much and this fell well into the latter category. My Dad loved his French Onion soup which was rich and sweet and apparently made with three types of onions.  Things improved vastly with our entrees. We had the filet mignon special, shrimp & grits and grilled catfish. Portions here are HUGE and big enough to share. I have to say I was pretty happy with the quality and seasoning of my catfish. My father's filet was so tender and wonderful that he cut it with a butter knife and my mom's shrimps were the size of my hand and super tasty. I am a huge fan of grits and the chef did a decent job with these. They are super chunky and gritty though so if you're not a grits fan, this is not the place to try them.  For dessert we split the chocolate hazelnut torte which was a rich, creamy sweet rather than sugary sweet but again, something was missing.   We sat in the back room which was much quieter than the front bar area and offered a view of the kitchen which I'm a huge fan of.  In terms of service, I have to give props to the manager. I called around noon to make a 6pm reservation and although he said they were full, he squeezed us in. I would come back here for a cocktail but will be sure to call first.",

    "text": "The shuttle guy from the hotel recommended this place. I realize I am from Texas, so getting good, authentic Cajun food isn't hard. With that said, this place is awful in terms of food. I ordered the crawfish andouille flatbread, and it was terrible. Firstly, it wasn't a flatbread; it was a pizza. Secondly, there was brown oil dripped from the andouille, which made the pizza soggy. Thirdly, because the pizza was soggy, it was hard to eat. I was picking at it so badly that the waiter and the owner talked me into getting another dish.  I decided on the Scallop Mac Daddy. It was better, but not by much. I've decided seafood and macaroni & cheese probably aren't the best combination. The scallops were big (see picture), which was good, but they gave the mac & cheese a weird flavor. I realize the two dishes I picked aren't True NOLA style, but there's no crawfish etouffee on the menu (blasphemy in my book)! In fact, most of the dishes aren't really indicative of NOLA, in my opinion.  The long island was terrible. The bartender used spiced rum instead of normal rum, and this always makes a long island un-drinkable. I had already sent back a dish, so I didn't want to complain about the drink too, but I only took two sips. I left a full drink behind.  The only good thing from the meal was the caesar salad. I don't like anchovies on pizza, but I do like anchovies in a caesar salad. The salad had fresh ingredients, was crispy, and light. But after spending $45, including tip, the meal was not worth it. I will not come here again.",

We asked to be moved and since it was packed they just moved us to a different table, still outside. I could not eat my food because of the gnats. I know they can't help the outdoor elements, but I mean, seriously a big issue I had to leave the restaurant, my wine glass ended up with 3 gnats floating inside it. It was gross.",

    "text": "I moved to Pittsburgh a year ago, and have been a solid fan of NOLA until last night.    I had out-of-town guests and wanted to show the city off to them, thinking that a dinner at NOLA would be a great introduction.  Well, I failed to reckon that it was Friday, and, further, did not know that the live music was starting during prime dining hours.  What an embarrassment.  We were somewhat removed from where the singer was but, still, it was so loud that we were not able to attempt conversation.  We had much to talk about, but NOLA clearly was not the place.  I know that there are fans of ear-splitting music, but it completely ruined our evening.  After exiting the restaurant, it took us a while to stop shouting at each other to be heard.   And NOLA, as you may know, is not cheap.  At the risk of setting off the  If it s too loud, you are too old\" crowd, I wonder if NOLA would consider postponing the music until after the time when people are normally eating their meals.  Or toning it down a bit.    As usual, the food was delicious, the service was great (I have forgiven the restaurant for the time I asked for a pepper vodka martini that came with a layer of ground black pepper on the bottom of the glass) but any enjoyment was destroyed by the painfully loud music.  I would like to come back, NOLA, but...",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I visited the Holiday Market this past Saturday and afterwards  we wanted to get our grub on so I decided we would try NOLA since I had only been there a few times previously for drinks and wanted to taste their food. We arrived around 1:15pm and immediately noticed, while it was crowded, there were 2 seats at the bar so,naturally,we snapped those up. Service began horrendously, and honestly, that is being quite kind. There were 2 bartenders, a male and a female, who were much more into their own private conversation than any of their patrons. Once they decided to start doing what they are paid to do (and I worked for 5 years in the restaurant industry as a server so I am quite patient and understanding but this was just pure.awful.service.), each one of them had to have walked by my boyfriend and I a minimum of 5 times each. I made eye contact multiple times with the male-and he also made eye contact with me more than once-but we never got an acknowledgement of \"be right with you\" or, even better, \"what can I get you to drink?\" After, and oh yes I timed it, 13 minutes, the female and I finally made eye contact, and she put down two napkins and said \"I'll get you waters and be right back\". I'm sure she could read the look in my eye when she finally did notice us because she immediately went over to the male bartender and reprimanded him for not getting us drinks and menus. Service did get slightly better after this point, however, I already had a pretty sour taste in my mouth from not being acknowledged for 13 minutes.  We both ordered Stella drafts and were given menus quickly. For some reason, although we made it clear we were going to order lunch, the male bartender dropped off our tab for the two drafts. My mouth nearly dropped-$14! Since when has Stella ever been a $7 draft beer?! We only ordered those 2, thank god, so our beer portion of the tab was not going to be any more than that. Now we were given lunch menus, obviously, and I was disappointed that some of the items (like the alligator) were not on the lunch menu. I did like the option of soup (or salad) and half of a sandwich though. I had been wanting to try their gumbo for quite some time so I decided to go with a cup of the gumbo and 1/2 of a turkey cuban sandwich. The gumbo ya-ya was served at the same time as the sandwich, which was also served with voodoo fries. The gumbo contained chicken (I could tell it was dark meat just FYI),andouille, Okra, File, and Steamed Rice. Honestly, I did not taste any andouille in my portion and there was, in my opinion, too many ingredients to not enough broth. It wasn't spicy but was a decent flavor-better than canned gumbo at least. The turkey cuban is described as being on a Baked Baguette with House-made Pickles, Creole Mustard, Jarlsberg, and Sweet Pepper Jam. I really enjoyed the creole mustard-it had a nice kick to it but was not overly hot. I did not taste any of the sweet pepper jam on the sandwich so if it was present, it was in a very small amount. The bread was extremely hard and almost difficult to chew, although I could tell it was not stale tasting. The pickles were delicious but I have a thing for pickles.....the best part of my meal,honestly,were the fries. There was some type of seasoning salt with a cajun kick on them and wow-they were so,so yummy! It's kind of sad though when you say the fries were the best part of your meal.   My boyfriend ordered the Creole Pulled Pork Po Boy, described as being served on a Fresh Baguette with Pulled Pork Shoulder, Slaw, Onion Rings. It also came with the same fries. I was originally leaning towards this sandwich but I'm glad I chose what I did. His sandwich, in my opinion, did not look appetizing at all. The pork looked really dry and the two onion rings on top were about the size of a quarter each. He ate most of it,however, he will eat nearly anything. He was in agreement that the fries were the best part of his meal too.  This experience was rather disappointing as I have wanted to try the food at NOLA for quite some time and was highly looking forward to it. Although I only gave NOLA 2 stars, I do want to come back and try it for dinner when there is a bit more variety on the menu. I just hope when I do come back both the service and the food are improved for that visit.",

They have a starter and entree special for $18. I got the beignets as a starter and the crab cake benedict. The beignets were divine. I wish there was more than 2! The crab cake benedict was good. I usually love Cajun food and seasonings, but I feel they over do it a lot. We got the marghertia pizza as an appetizer and it was just okay. I'm not a fan of green tomatoes, and they sort of put a lot of Cajun seasoning on it. But my dad enjoyed it. He got the catfish po boy, it was huge! But he said it was very good. Overall a good experience. I definitely want to go back and try something different.",

    "text": "Good Cajun food in the heart of Pittsburgh Market Square. It's cool how they've tried to recreate a NOLA French quarter-like look for the exterior, and a NOLA Bourboun street-like electrifying atmosphere inside. I hadn't imagined the place would be so huge before entering, but thankfully that meant there wasn't any wait for lunch on a busy Christmas weekend.  Loved the ambience and the decor inside, cool yet classy. Our waiter let us know that they were out of a couple of the menu items due to the Christmas craziness. No issues, the menu still had a number of tempting options. I stuck to classic Jambalaya, while my husband opted for the NOLA burger. Both of them were spot on. I loved the complex flavors of the jambalaya and the generous portions of meat and shrimp.  So what's not to like about this place? The service. Well, I'm not sure if it was a one-off experience for us, since other Yelpers seem to be happy with the service. I understand that it was Christmas weekend, but the painfully slow service when the restaurant was half-empty is not quite acceptable. The waiter came to take our order minutes after we arrived, and when we said we needed some time to look through the menu, he went on a mini-vacation. Once he finally took our order, he went on a world-tour..our food took forever to arrive. No explanations for the delay, not even an update, our waiter seemed to really hate our table. I had to ask others for water, ketchup, etc. I could see the staff all around us very lively and sociable, and if I could interact with any of them, this could have easily turned into a much better dining experience.",

Once a month my friends and i do a couples dinner night and we came here. The service was mediocre, the staff wasn't very accommodating, but what saved them was their food. The chicken and dumplings was really good and the alligator is the best thing on the menu, although their portions are the same! My girlfriend ordered the same thing as me and her portion looked like a kid size, she was disappointed. When it was time to order the dessert the waiter took our order only to come back 25 minutes later and tell us that the kitchen was closed, what a huge disappointment being as though there was only 2 other people in the restaurant and nothing slowing the waiter down from putting in our order.",

We ordered fries and mac and cheese for our little one. He enjoyed the fries. They're definitely much better than Primanti's! The mac and cheese was a nice take on the traditional kid friendly item with corkscrew pasta in a creamy cheese sauce.  Onto the good stuff, my pork tenderloin was heavenly for lack of a better description. Ok, it was tender and flavorful in a sweet potato puree. It was delicious to the last bite. My wife had ordered the grilled chicken and dumplings. That was light and delicious and was complemented with grilled carrots and peas. The flavor and seasoning of the chicken was spot on. I had asked for hot sauce. Both entrees didn't need any additional seasoning or condiments!  For dessert we had the beignets with ice cream. It was made to order and a good complement to a great dinner. Service was friendly and on target. The food was brought out quickly. All of the waitstaff was friendly, attentive and on their game even though they were closing within the hour. We never felt rushed, and everything was timely.  People watching on the square is a whole other thing to do while you dine.",

I honestly couldn't imagine a cajun/creole restaurant with a better feeling. Nola is as close to New Orleans as you can get in our great city.  As far as it comes to signature cocktails, I sampled two. A Gin Concoction that looked more like a white russian, but was very refreshing at the same time. And since I, myself, felt like such a amateur (girly) drinker, I had to order something with bourbon in it after. So, I went with something that tasted and looked a lot like a Manhattan, but had a much smoother aftertaste.   For an appetizer,  we delicately chose the crab gratin, which came with six perfectly toasted pieces of french baguette. The gratin was perfect with melted cheese on top, and it wasn't filling, like some other gratin based meal that makes one feel full after a few indulgences. You could see the gigantic lump crab meat on every bite.  The entree was a bit expensive for a filet mignon at $33 for a plate of glorified steak, asparagus, and mashed potatoes. But damn, it was amazing. The steak was the best cooked medium-rare filet mignon I've ever had.  The mashed potatoes were just like something your grandma would make.   For desert, my date and I went with a chocolate mousse, with a chocolate cake middle layer, and on top was a roasted marshmallow, which was the size of a softball. After taking two bites, my mind and stomach threw in the towel.   The whole entire meal was perfect from start to finish. The only reason I'm giving Nola four stars and not five is because of the price. I definitely felt like Nola charges way too much for the type of establishment they portray themselves to be when you walk in and sit down. Just a thought.",

We had the entire back room to ourselves. I did like being so close to the kitchen.   We started with the fried alligator. It was good and would have again.   I had the jambalaya. It came out steaming hot that I could barely eat it. It had a nice variety of seafood in it. It had two large scallops, a few grilled shrimp, a few pieces of chicken and a good red sauce that had a little heat.   I nearly finished the entire plate.   Nice to try a new place and really liked the new place.   Service was fast and friendly with some southern charm.",

I got the fried chicken and waffles with chorizo gravy, and it was exactly what I'd hoped for. My friend got the club and she enjoyed it, but I don't think it was anything to write home to mom about. However, we shared the beignets and they are AWESOME. I didn't want to share after I tried mine. They were like fluffy little pieces of heaven, floating around in a sea of powdered sugar dreams. Seriously, get the beignets. Will be back for sure.",

The ingredients listed on the menu made the salad sound amazing. It was absolutely tasteless. The lettuce was ice cold. It literally tasted like ice cold lettuce with a drop of dressing on it. I then had the crawfish flatbread. Once again the Ingredients on the menu made the flatbread sound delicious...... Once again tasteless.  The service was okay but the price was outrageous for how tasteless the food was.  My fiancee had the jambalaya.  The jambalaya was good.  But it definitely was not good enough to pay $29 dollars for a small bowl of it. I would definitely not go back to this restaurant.  There are many more over priced restaurants in Pittsburgh that serve much better food. Thumbs down!",

The decor was lovely and our waitress was nice but that was all that was good. I ordered the Crawfsh Mac Daddy and for such a promising name the actual dish left so much to be desired. For starters, rather than a rich, creamy cheese sauce that coated the noodles and the seafood I received a thin, vaguely cheese flavored water that sloshed at the bottom of the cast iron dish. And rather than well seasoned seafood and tender vegetables, I got rubbery, nearly to the point of being inedible seafood that had no seasoning, much less anything that could even begin to bring to mind Creole or Cajun flavor, and raw vegetables. I didn't even finish it even though I was pretty hungry. There was hardly any flavor at all. For $26 dollars I expect actual seasoning and something that I, as someone who doesn't cook for a living, could not do better. I'm sad to say you'd  get more flavor at Popeyes.",

    "text": "After another couple of visits here, I have to give this place a downgrade. I was excited when it first opened, and may have been a bit overly enthused after my first visit. The food is good...A-OK is actually very apt...but not of the caliber that you'd find in New Orleans. The waitstaff likes to let you know that the chef spent 5 years in New Orleans, and some of the food coming out of the kitchen here reflects that. There are just too many misses for it to be 5 or even 4 star.  We were in for their Mardi Gras celebration last night, and they were offering a few specials for the occasion, which I took advantage of, as the regular menu is not large, and I've had most everything that I want to try on it already. The duck and oyster gumbo was very good, with tender duck meat as well as delightful cracklins, and whole oysters swimming in a full flavored broth with long grain rice. Thumbs up on the gumbo. I was delighted to see crawfish etouffee as a special, as this really belongs on the regular menu of any Creole restaurant. When you get this meal anywhere in New Orleans (I know, I know...I keep harping on the whole New Orleans thing. But this place is claiming that badge, so I feel justified in making the comparison), it comes as a kind of saucy stew served over long grain white rice. Maybe a sprinkle of parsley. The chef here served it over puff pastry with asparagus and house cured tasso. When I saw that description, my heart sank a little, but I ordered it anyway. I understand that he was trying to dress up the dish a little, as people outside of Louisiana might not think the simplicity of this dish warrants a $24 price tag. If I base my review on just the etouffee alone, it was not very good. Not enough creamy sauce, not enough flavor. The addition of the puff pastry and aspargus pulled it down more. The puff pastry was just in the way, and the asparagus, while perfectly cooked, did not belong with the other elements on the plate. The house made tasso lacked depth of flavor, and seemed like just strips of ham that they had put some dry rub on and aged. This whole dish needs work. We skipped dessert last night as we had 2 on our last visit, and they were both disappointing. The NOLA cocktail, which is bourbon, simple syrup, absinthe and lemon juice, had not enough bourbon flavor and too much lemon. I also need to mention service. We had three servers come to our table and say the EXACT SAME THING. One would greet us, let us know that they and another two servers would be taking care of us, ask us if we'd been here before, and get a drink order. By the third time it was beyond annoying, and my vocal partner let them know. I've said it before...team service needs to be three different people doing different tasks, so the customer isn't burdened with repetition. Again, some things here, like the redfish, flat breads, gumbo and the porkchop, are very good. Others need work.",

    "text": "Last night my husband and I had a very short baby sitting window to grab a few bites and drinks. After stopping next door at Sienna for a drink and app we decided to head over to NOLA next. I have been there once before a few years ago with a girlfriend and I had the best oyster stew I have ever had. That is why I gave a two star review. Unfortunately this time we didn't get to try anything to eat.  We sat ourselves at the bar after alerting the host that we were there for a drink and an app. It seemed fairly busy. Not crazy, but decently busy. We sat and waited for anyone to acknowledge our arrival. Down the bar we saw a barback polishing glasses. A couple employees farther down chatting it up with each other. So we decided to give it a few minutes before making any rational decisions.  Another minute or so goes by. The manager walks right by us with glasses without even looking at us or any of the other guests at the bar. At this point we realize that we think there is only one bartender for the whole 20 person bar. My thing is if you only have one bartender and barback maybe help your employees out a little bit?  So another couple minutes go by. We decide to give it another 60 seconds. And alas, nothing. So we missed out on our stew and drink we were looking forward to and decided to get up and leave.  I don't know if anyone noticed the two people sitting at the bar got up and left. I honestly hope they did. We are both in the restaurant/bar industry and the first thing you do when you are in the weeds is at least aknowledge to new guests that you will be with them shortly. We may have been more forgiving if someone at least said hello to us.  Maybe one day we will try to include NOLA into our downtown restaurant hop date-night again. But probably not in the near future.",

First things first, you can't come here and not try the alligator.  Our waitress recommended it, and I'm so glad she did.  Imagine a cross between popcorn chicken and fried calamari with a spicy aioli dipping sauce: that's what the alligator was like.  We also loved our entrees, but be warned, they are gigantic portions.  I got the cajun pork chop, which was easily enough for two meals, and my husband got the scallops mac daddy, which looked like two pounds of homemade gourmet mac n cheese.  Flavors were great, and I loved the little bit of spicy kick in everything.  NOLA also has a sizeable specialty drink list, so we tried a few New Orleans-inspired cocktails from that.  They were healthy pours, and a decent price.  I'm not much of a bourbon drinker, but their Bourbon Street Blues cocktail was pretty good.  Finally, you have to spring for dessert, and you have to get the beignets.  They're like a donut and a funnel cake all in one, loaded with powdered sugar, and served alongside a trio of yummy sherbets.  I mean it: no matter how much you eat beforehand, save room for this dessert!  NOLA also hosts live music and special events (like an upcoming Mardi Gras celebration).  They're located in Market Square, but they also have free valet parking if it's crowded and you can't find a spot for your car.  We loved it, and we'll definitely be back (for more alligator).",

    "text": "Oh where to begin.  I have been to Nola's three times and have had three different types of experiences.  The first time was for lunch in 2012.  From what I can recall it was decent.  The next time I went to Nola was for brunch over my birthday weekend.  The Big Y Group, in case you didn't know, offers birthday dinners/lunch or brunches around your birthday if you sign up online.  You should sign up it's a good deal and you can use it at most of their locations.  So on to Brunch.  We made reservations.  Not needed, I believe we were the only people in there at 11:30 on a sunny Sunday in August.  We had a waitress who was training another girl.  We ordered some beer and OJ to make beermimosas , try it if you haven't.  It's not just for hipsters kids.  I ordered the Eggs Trivette, Toasted Challah Bread, Crawfish Tail Meat, Black Pepper Bacon, Crystal Bechamel, Over-Easy Eggs, Served with Fruit Salad.  The wait was a little on the long side being that we were dining completely alone, but not over-the-top long.  Our food came out and I did enjoy the eggs, but didn't taste much crawfish.  The sauce was rich but nothing said Cajun to me like I would have expected.  Still a tasty dish, but the fruit salad it came with was pathetic.  There was a mix of pineapple which was mostly core, =inedible, some dried up pieces of cantaloupe and honeydew and a few slivers of watermelon.  Who put this together?  It was clearly old and really disappointing for a restaurant that is supposed to be more upscale.  However, overall it wasn't bad, and had I written my review 3 months ago they would have received 3 stars, but I didn't.  This leads me to our last visit, which occurred over Halloween weekend approximately 5:30 in the evening.    We headed to Nola's this time for drinks.  I was really in the mood to have some rye whisky or bourbon as I enjoy the finer things in life.  We secured a spot at the bar and was perusing the drink menu.  My husband really likes German style beers, and I noticed they had St. Pauli Girl on the bottle menu.  Mind you this is listed under their beer list and priced at $4.50, I encouraged him to order it even though he never had it since I've been known to dabble in the sampling of fine wines and beers and found it enjoyable in the past.  I went with a SAZERAC $10 BULLEIT RYE OR HENNESSY | HERBSAINT | PEYCHAUD'S BITTERS | ESSENTIAL LEMON OIL.    Side note.  This is Halloween weekend and everyone working there is in costume.  For the love of God I don't know why places encourage or make their employees dress for Halloween but I am off topic.    Anyhow, there were a couple of bartenders and waiters and waitresses kind of loitering at the bar, I am assuming since it was early and there weren't many people in the place yet.  I get the male bartenders attention and we order the pre-mentioned drinks.  He makes mine first then sets a non-alcoholic beer in front of my husband and walks away. Said husband notices a few moments after that this is not what was expected.  I was kind of upset, because I feel that drink had NO business being listed on the \"BEER\" menu if it is not alcoholic and doesn't come out and clearly say that.  Listed next to its name it says n/a.  Well I don't know what n/a meant maybe the restaurant should spell out Non-alcoholic, or put it in the section next to where you order soft drinks.  I was pretty upset, feeling that the bartender should have said something to warn us and just really wanted to get him another beer.  Well now the bartender is at the end of the bar talking to Donald Trump (waiter) laughing it up and I am yelling over excuse me.  Well bartender makes a half assed attempt at coming down to talk to me.  He starts to walk toward me as Donald must have said something that beckoned him back as I was only in mid-sentence of explaining that we weren't aware the drink was not alcoholic he dips back and turns to Trump laughing at whatever line came out of his mouth.  I said quite loud oh that's nice walk away while I am talking to you?  He just kind of looks at me and Matt says never mind I'll just drink it it's not that bad.  It was that bad and I am not only upset that the bartender didn't alert us of the non-alcoholic (in my world N/A means not applicable, but in this case is very applicable) drink, but that he found it more important to laugh with the other employees than speak to a customer talking to him.  To top it off I heard him insult a female employee about what she was wearing to a very negative tune when another female employee told her to ignore him.  It was very disrespectful.  I fumed the rest of the short visit and asked for the check from the female bartender.  I didn't want to tip anything but knew they probably all split tips so I did so sparingly.  Epic fail, can't think of a reason to return.  I will use my birthday coupon at another Big Y Group restaurant next year.",

    "text": "ow, I was really blown away at NOLA at Market Square. This place was recommended to me by a work associate complimenting the food. I walked in to a busy bar that seemed lively. Come to find it was a pub crawl that stopped crawling. I ordered the squash and pumpkin soup ($6) with the Shrimp and Grits ($27).   I Thought is was very pricey but I don't mind if the quality is up to par. The atmosphere is very authentic to NOLA but that's where the similarities stop. The soup arrived in seconds and was bitter and salty, obviously it had been reducing for days, which was upsetting because squash and pumpkin soup is usually sweet, warm and delicious. The bartender offered to get me something else so I tried the french onion soup. It took 10 minutes, the cheese was nicely baked but the soup had little onions, it was very salty, and the bread was a gel.   At this point I was scared to see the shrimp and grits. And as expected the dish was unrecognizable from my Cajun experience. The grits were served as a cake bar which was not seasoned topped with a watery sauce that had congealed under the lamps. The celery was raw and crunchy. This was garnished with inedible garnish \"to offset the color\". Which is sorely needed as the color was disgusting.   I spoke to the manager who apologized but was unwilling to try the food and didn't seem interested in my opinion. He told me this was a Pittsburgh take on shrimp and grits. And he assured me others like it and removed everything from the bill. I left hungry and unhappy with the managers attitude. If they cared about quality or service the manager would have addressed the poor food immediately.  I feel sorry for everyone there that has to stomach that blemish on Cajun cuisine. In the future listen to customers and if you're going for Cajun in Pittsburgh keep it authentic!",

Absolutely amazing jam that could go with a number of items. The shrimp was a good size and tasted fresh. The seasoned fries were also very good. I'll definitely be returning.

But keep the receipt as we were ticketed by Pittsburgh for not parking .... even though we paid the valet service....   NOLA refused to allow for reservations in the \"bar area\" for watching/viewing bands.  We used to go about 2 hours early to wedge our way forward toward the performers.  But the management's view is not conducive to getting decent seating.  We have been there before and told to \"wait\" at the bar, then others come in and get band row seating.... (secret handshake?).  We used to call the manager over and ask for decent seating.... \"maybe.\"  My party of 8 decided, after this call to reservations today before 1 pm, to go elsewhere as we told there could be no assigned/reserved seating toward the band(s).  But others come in and are seated....   Sigh.  There are so much better Pittsburgh venues for appreciating music, and having seating/reservation service.    Amusingly, BJ's in Wexford doesn't take reservations per se but puts one on a priority list for seating depending on traffic.  And they discuss the options and timing of arrival.  Stunningly different customer experience.    Fred.",

It wasn't one of those situations where a customer eats the majority of the meal then sends it back. I was only a couple bites in. My wife said her meal was okay but nothing special. (I think she got the voodoo pasta). In the end, my meal was removed from the bill, my wife had no complaints but no praise, and our waiter was so extremely nice.

The color scheme is all purples and greens, and there are many historic touches such as a beautifully detailed ceiling. You almost forget that you're still in Pittsburgh!  The staff here is fantastic. My boyfriend and I enjoyed our waiter who was very personable and talkative with us. He even gave us pointers for some of his other favorite restaurants in the city that we should try out.  We started with the red beans and rice as an appetizer, which were so packed full of flavor I couldn't even believe it! You won't find a bland dish on the menu here. I had the shrimp and grits for my entree, and they were the best shrimp and grits I have ever had. The presentation was stunning (see the photo below), and I talked my boyfriend's ear off about how delicious it was for basically the entire time I was eating it. For dessert we shared this phenomenal chocolate and caramel cake that was also expertly decorated. I highly recommend the food here. It is on the more pricey side, but in my opinion is absolutely worth the price. This is a great place for a date night or special occasion. I have always wanted to travel to New Orleans and have never been able to, so I'm thrilled that I have such a delicious and authentic creole restaurant right here in Pittsburgh!",

Of course we didn't complain since we wanted to sit there, but others further back did.   Unfortunately, the quality of the food and drinks were bad. We ordered fried green tomatoes, frog legs, brisket sliders (on special), and crawfish flatbread. The tomatoes came out first, well before anything else - they were very bland. So about 20-25 minutes later the other appetizers came out with an additional plate of tasteless tomatoes. They advised the additional plate was on the house for the wait. Now for the frog legs... They were prepared differently than describes on the menu. Instead of being breaded, they came out in a broth... This was also very bland. The crawfish flatbread was soggy/slimy, but the brisket sliders were okay. They were dry, but the only decent item that we had. For a Cajun/Creole restaurant, the food was disappointing. The drinks were also very disappointing. We were going to order actual entrees, but given the quality that night - we opted out of that.   At least the service was good. The waitress brought us everything we asked for, and came to check on us often.  The last time I was at Nola the food was very good, but that was a couple years ago. Not sure what happened, but I won't be visiting Nola again any time soon...",

The place was packed, and I was worried we would have to go elsewhere, but, no, NOLA was up for this challenge. We were assigned a feisty, diligent waitress who was everything you want in a server and were treated like royalty. 5 stars.  The food was not as sensational but agreeable. I started with the alligator tail appetizer--it was compromised to a certain extent as the batter had too much chili pepper--made it difficult to taste the meat. Once I pulled off the batter, the alligator was tender and of good quality.   We all shared our various main courses a la family style--so got to taste a lot of NOLA's entrees in one visit. Steak marchand de vin was excellent; blackened catfish was respectable; chicken and dumplings was below average; and seafood jambalaya had way too much heat (and was even ordered less spicy). Also partook of the NOLA salad and the smokey caesar salad and both were just okay. Nothing jumped out at me in terms of the desserts.  It's a fun spot with lots of charm and gaiety. There is live music, and that is a very nice feature however it was almost too loud for us. Perhaps reducing the decibel level during peak dinner hours might be a consideration.    NOLA is a place where \"laissez les bon temps rouler\" is for real.",

That was a huge portion, big enough for two to share. They were still warm when we got home. Four, palm-sized, light beniegts coated with powdered sugar, served with sorbet. My husband ordered a cup of gumbo and the featured dinner-blackened kobia (fish) with roasted peaches, chantrel mushrooms, and corn served on endive leaves. (see  picture) Service was excellent, tables were available inside and on the sidewalk out front. Had to wash it down with an Abita brew. Looking forward to our next visit.",

I went up to them about 30 minutes in to see if they had forgotten us and got a confused look and finally a yes, we have you on the list.   They never seated us and never came around to offer alternatives or anything.  There were open tables.  Finally, we left and ate elsewhere.  Beyond the service, there was loud music--too loud to talk--blaring in the dining area.  I like music.  I like restaurants.  I don't mind when restaurants have music.  But when you cannot hear what the person you are eating with is saying to you and the bartenders cannot hear what you are ordering, the music is too loud for a restaurant.  I go to restaurants to enjoy a good meal and have a nice conversation with whomever I'm with.  I would guess most people share that belief.  If I want it that loud, I'll go to a bar, not a restaurant.    Oh, and the beer from the taps tasted funky.  They either aren't cleaning their taps or are cleaning them improperly.  I tasted both an IPA and a wheat beer.  Both were weird.  Sorry, NOLA, but nothanks.",

The atmosphere is also quite nice, feels a bit fancy and the space is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside. For lunch, I always get the soup and half sandwich duo (with fries, of course) because it's a little bit of variety. I've tried the gumbo and french onion soup, and the shredded beef po boy (which I think they took off the menu) and the muffaletta. All have tasted great, a few steps up from an Au Bon Pain lunch. The voodoo fries are seasoned pretty well, a little spicy, so you might not even need ketchup. Nola gets a crowd for lunch, though, so if you plan on coming here, call and reserve a table ahead of time. In terms of drinks, their drinks are pretty great too. The cocktails are a little pricey, but around $10 is the going rate for most drinks downtown anyway. Overall, I think this place is pretty good and my coming back soon is very likely.",

I had went during their grand opening phase it was not what I anticipated at all, however, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience this week.  As a person with a sensitive stomach I am nervous to try many different things with unknown spices or possible ingredients I could get sick from. I did try the red beans and rice which were amazing. I definitely would get that again. And it should be good. I mean. If a New Orleans inspired restaurant cannot make good red beans and rice, why is it open?  Since I was there for lunch I knew I wanted a flat bread. The waiter suggested I try the eggplant and chevre. I like it but would not run back to order it again. The flat bread itself was good, I just was not feeling the flavor. In the past I have had the pissaladiere which was very good. I also stole a few of my coworkers voodoo fries which were amazing. Honestly I'd go back just for the fries. The sandwiches all looked great and I really like their lunch combination ideas and the way they are presented.  It is just such a neat place inside. I hate describing things as neat, but it really is. I wish it were more voodoo decorated, but that is just me. I think for it's location (being in the north), it does New Orleans justice. I cannot wait to go back and get the shrimp po boy!",

We were seated pretty quickly considering the size of our party and the fact that it was approximately 12:30 or so.   Our waiter had the personality and friendliness of a rock.  So despite our pretty quick and good start things quickly went south from there.  After taking our order they began bringing out the food roughly 20 minutes later.  That is food for 4 out of 6 of us.  After 10 minutes our waiter realized that two of us didn't have any food and came over to ask \"what ya order\"?  Apparently the cooks 'lost' our order.  A couple minutes later one more of our party had their food but the last person still did not.  10 minutes after that the manager greeted us, apologized and said that the last person's meal was on the house, and offered him a free soup in the mean time.   Everyone was now free of guilt to eat their food as the last member had some soup.  The food was pretty good, but nothing great. The icing on the cake... our bill was wrong and we were over-charged by roughly $30.  We had to speak with the manager to get that sorted out as well.   I will not be going back.",

    "text": "I have dined here 3 times now so I feel like I have tried enough to give it a fair shake.  To be fair, this is a 5 star restaurant in Pittsburgh but I have actually left the city limits unlike some of my neighbors and dined in cities all over the country.  I would not visit this restaurant if it were in New Orleans.  I own a house there and am there quite a bit so they have a pretty high bar to reach with me.  It might do ok in the touristy part of the city on Decatur St but would certainly close if it were out in the neighborhoods.    The service has been pretty good.  Although last night we had 3 members of the waitstaff try to take our drink order and give us the spiel.  I was pretty irritated by the 3rd person and had to tell him to stop and tell the others he was duplicating service.  The rest of the night, blessedly, they left us to enjoy our meal.  I like the flatbreads.  I had them the first time I visited.  I also think the pork chop dish is really good.  I don't love the beans and rice.  They've missed here and it's a serious offense for someone who loves this food.  There's too much grease on the plate and there's chili powder or something in there.  It should just taste more like beans and andouille.  I fear they've tried too hard on this one.  I had a perfectly cooked redfish and I like the slaw.  The duck and oyster special gumbo was good but is missing the umami of a terrific gumbo and if it were my first one I would probably have thought it terrific.  The food all the way around is solidly good but I am not a 4 star fan.  It just misses for me.    If you've never had this cuisine and live here you should definitely go and check it out.  It's a lot of fun and I am sure you'll have a good meal.",

    "text": "We hit NOLA a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday night.  We got there pretty early and were part of the show crowd.  The place is misleading, size-wise from the outside - it's pretty large inside, with at least three distinct seating areas.  It also seems as though there should be one table removed from the area where we were seated.  While understanding that table turn $$$ is why every restaurant is in business, it was like dining in a NYC subway car at 6pm.  Seasonal House Sangria was tasty and different.  Of course it included bourbon and also sported a bruised rosemary sprig instead of fruit - Yum!  It indeed tasted like the perfect winter sangria - we both loved it.  Fried Green Tomatoes are an obsession of mine so I couldn't wait to sample NOLA's version.  While they were good, the tempura was overpowering and left me still wanting fried green tomatoes. Two entrees were enjoyed.  I had the Wood Roasted Quail which was served with the best prepared asparagus ever - nice and firm.  The quail was well done and flavorful with both the rice and cranberry sauce complementing the bird.  The oyster dressing was not great; mushy describes both flavor and texture.  My companion had the Scallop and Shrimp Mac Daddy which was served in a cast iron pan and had great flavor.  I would go back only to try out the sandwich side of the menu, as it also looked tempting.  They were very busy, but I feel like if I go in with diner expectation I would be better satisfied with the loud atmosphere, tight quarters and rushed staff.  Muffaletta or Po'boy... sangria can make the jump!  Also - made reservation through Yelp - how much easier can things be???  I wish more restaurants used this feature!",

The alligator was disappointing not because of the tastes, it was extremely delicious.  It tasted like a mix of chicken and calamari with a spicy seasoning.  Heavily breaded and heavily spices.  The sauce that came with it tasted almost like the onion petal sauce from the Outback.   However it was so small and it came on a long plate.  There were 12 small pieces of it.  There was more sauce than alligator and it was $13!  Never again.    His gumbo wasn't particularly spicy and it had too much tomato sauce but it was close to New Orlans.  Can't complain too much considering how far away we are.  My pasta was extra saucy and small.  The dish it came on was huge too.  Why the excessive presentation?  Biggest complaints?  No po'boys, no ghost peppers, and no jazz through the speakers!  Plus the decor looked as if they were getting ready for Mardi Gras.  Nice artwork though and the waiter was a sweetheart (thanks Miles!).  He was attentive and polite.    All in all I probably will not go back for dinner.  Granted we tipped Miles well the cost was just excessive for how little we got.  Will try again for lunch one day.",

I highly recommend the Duck Mac Daddy, which is duck Mac & cheese. It was very rich and filling but my favorite menu item. We also got the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer and they were cooked perfectly, and were topped with a very delicious Cajun cream sauce. I would definitely save room for dessert. Kira was our sever and she was attentive, charismatic, and fun, but she never once was overbearing or got in the way of us enjoying our meal. Overall, I would say a great dinner place or just to get drinks and apps!",

Is that too much to ask? None on the menu. None available off the menu. Zero. Considerable disappointment. Oh, ok, you can get excited about the novelty of alligator bites. I've had alligator in every form (including ribs) all over the Gulf states and in a dozen restaurants in New Orleans, and these are nothing special. They're good for an experience and to tell everyone you ate alligator but how much joy do you get from that. You won't order them twice.  I'm a jambalaya afficianado. NOLA's is complelety unremarkable. Wait, I take that back. It's remarkable in it'soddity - they use 3 whole chicken wings for the chicken component. Messy and not a good call. And where's the mudbugs? Jambalaya needs crawfish!! And where's the ettoufe? Nowhere, that's where.   I love Abita beer and they have  a good selection. But that's about the most positive thing I can say about the place. Sure, it's a novelty. Yeah, it's a great place to take your out of town guests for someplace new and different. But if you ask me, it's not a place I'd recommend. Go once. You'll agree with me.",

Being a Louisiana native now living in Pittsburgh, you rarely find any cajun food anywhere and if you do, it's not what it should be.   Everything I had was delicious, the chef was more than helpful with preparing an item I had requested and then just went ahead with making the entire meal an amazingly delicious experience that reminded me of home.   The bartender did make the oddest version of a Hurricane I had ever had. I don't think that particular person knew what they were doing, but my review is for the food, not the bar.   My only other complaint, would be that the waitress didn't seem to know much about the food. She served my husband and I a tasting of etouffee, but never brought the rice to go with it and had not come back to check on us so we just had a few bites of it by itself. It was good, just not served properly. Being in the service industry myself, it really makes me a lil picky about how I get treated when I dine out, and I was turned off that a place this unique to this area, where especially most people here don't know this type of food, should have servers who know what they are serving.",

On walking up I was confused by the store front making it blend in as I was expecting it to be \"poppy\". It was a Sunday so on entering it was dead maybe two other tables dining. We where greeted and seated in the back by the grill. It was much different than I was picturing in my head with a name like \"NOLA\" thinking New Orleans and it's colors and liveness. But that's ok because it did have a few cool art pieces. Now for the menu I can say it's a bit updated from what's on yelp and there site. I was disappointed to see there was no frog legs on the menu like I've read about from past reviews. It was much smaller than you would expect from a place like this but maybe it's a good thing cause they can focus more on there main dishes. I decided to try the \"gumbo ya-ya\" for a soup starter. I was impressed with the taste and the large chunks of okra and the meats. The rice was great not over cooked at all. Overall for the soup the flavor was nice I just wish it had a kick of heat. For my main dish I decided on the \"country fried pork chop\" and I'm very happy I did. Now for this  it was so rich with flavors and blended so well it really was a New Orleans style dish. It was a large portion pork chop that was still juicy with that crispy breading coating. The andouille mustard greens where out of this world so delicious and packed with flavor. As for the white rice it was sadly kinda cold and it was noticeable cause everything else was so hot. But the gravy really pulled everything together! A side note and I think it was a mix up because it says the dish comes with a side of \"apple butter\" but I got a side of cranberry sauce. The service was very nice and the waiter did answer questions about the menu. Overall I would return again to try a few other things on the dish.",

This time we had a party of 10 and they could accommodate us without a wait which was the only reason we were there.  We ordered 2 bottles of a cabernet off of the list and after about a 15 minute wait they returned to say they were out of the one we had chosen.  We chose another but it was very watery so we refused it.  They returned with another suggestion which we took, but declined to open the second because it just wasn't worth the $70 price tag.  All of this took 30 minutes before we could actually have a sip of wine!  Several people ordered cocktails from the bar and that took over 20 more minutes to arrive.  Overall the service was slow.  The burgers which some ordered came out rare when they were ordered medium or medium rare.  The catfish po-boy was greasy and soggy, obviously cooked at the wrong temp.  The one person who ordered chicken got violently ill later that night. it was obviously undercooked or spoiled.  So between the issue with the bar, the slow service and the food quality there is no way I would patronize them again.  It's a great location, I hope something better eventually takes over the spot!",

For a place that emphasizes New Orleans cuisine, the pierogis were fantastic, don't miss them. They were everybody's favorite. The po-boys were really good, the fresh baguettes are the best. Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. Very enjoyable meal.",

At 6:30 on a Saturday, we were the only patrons at the bar.  I ordered a cosmopolitan and my husband ordered a Moscow mule.   The bartender was efficient and made wonderful drinks.   The cosmo was perfect and very cold which I love.   The mule was served as it should be, in a copper mug, and also the right mix of ingredients.   Since I liked mine so much,  my husband asked the bartender how he made it, so hopefully I can have one at home now.  We did see some of the entrees and they looked and smelled yummy.",

Second our main dish seafood pop pie was mostly potato and crust with peas and a small amount of seafood  I think I had a total of four pieces of seafood in mine. Needless to say I won't be back.

    "text": "Going to the Cultural District to see a show always brings up the opportunity to also explore some of the fun restaurants that cater to the people who work and play in this area. We've not been to Nola on the Square before, so thought we should... and we did.  The building is quite colorful on the outside and the storefront itself is quite narrow. Once inside, the decor is on the dark side with a long corridor between the bar and some table. However, it widens out towards the back (where the kitchen is) and also has an upstairs, so there is actually quite a lot of space there. We were there early, so we saw the staff doing their prep work and watching TV...  Our server did treat us well and came to check on us periodically, so the fact that we were one of only three parties on hand meant that the did not take lesser care of us for watching TV!  The menu is slanted towards either Creole or Southern cooking. In addition to the New Orleans dishes that you might expect to find in a place with this kind of a name, we also saw Fried Green Tomatoes; Chicken and Dumplings; and stuffed Mushrooms that used Pimiento Cheese!   We ended up ordering the Fried Green Tomatoes and the Mushrooms for our appetizers; then we went with the Voodoo Pasta and the Seafood Jambalaya for our main dishes, and some Beignets for dessert. We also got a bottle of wine and were quite pleased with the price of about $70 per person - which is not high considering the quantities of dishes.  The food quality was somewhat variable, unfortunately. The Fried Green Tomatoes actually needed to be salted, but they came with a yogurt sauce which was fantastic and made the dish! The Mushrooms were disappointing in that was so little of the Pimento Cheese that you could not really taste it. The Voodoo Pasta was supposed to have Bucattini, but I swear that what came on the plate was Spaghetti! the sauce was supposed to be spicy (hence the name) but reminded me more of an Italian Arrabiata sauce than anything else. The Seafood Jambalaya was a study in contrasts: The shrimp and scallops were expertly prepared, but the chicken was charred and overcooked. The sausage was good. The star of the evening were the Beignets that came covered in powdered sugar and also with a small dish of Mango Sorbet (our choice). This dessert made the dinner!  Our waiter was highly knowledgeable about the food and steered us to the appropriate combinations for our taste. We also some saw dishes being take to other tables, and they looked very nice. I would definitely come back here as the cuisine is not the normal Pittsburgh offering and perhaps some of the faults I noted were temporary.",

The restaurant is much larger than it appears from the street. We were greeted by our fun and efficient server (Lauri), and presented with menus. The food is less expensive than most Cajun/Creole restaurants outside of Louisiana.  We began with a flatbread (prepared in a stone oven). I had a gumbo followed by jambalaya (which I requested they make VERY spicy.) The gumbo was authentic and delicious and the jambalaya was perfectly prepared with large shrimp and andouille sausage spiced as I requested. My partner had chicken and dumplings (and an odd choice for him) and he thought it delicious. I ate one of the dumplings: he was right!  I requested to speak with the manager to let him know how pleased we were with the service and the food quality. He, too, was delightful. He sat with us and chatted about the restaurant, plans for the restaurant's future, etc. We left very pleased with the NOLA experience. I give this restaurant a near perfect review and recommend it highly.",

First, it took at least an hour to get our appetizer and soups which I'm pretty sure were only brought out because we reminded him... his response was, \"oh I thought you wanted it all out at the same time.\" Not sure where he got that idea.. we ordered the soups and appetizers in addition to our full meals.  Next, of course after we asked, he brought out some rolls. The rolls were hard and so was the butter. Spreading wasn't even an option.   Mind you we also ordered drinks when we got there. They came out timely, however in the 2.5hours we were seated in our back booth (a table of 6... large enough to have the potential to get a decent tip, but not too large that we were at all hard to handle) our waiter never asked us if we wanted more beverages. He checked on us a total of 3 times throughout our time at Nola and never asked us if we would like to see a dessert menu. We also had to flag him down to get his attention in order to pay for our meal.  The fried green tomato appetizer and French onion soup was the only good part of the entire meal. The portions were small for the price and not anything earth shatteringly delicious.  We will definitely not be going back for dinner. Maybe for lunch if we aren't in any hurry or aren't very hungry.",

The po' boy is usually beer battered but because I can't have certain fried foods, the server checked with the kitchen and suggested that I get the catfish blackened. The salad was great, I always get it in my combo meal, and the fries were hot and perfectly seasoned. The blackened catfish on the sandwich was so good, exactly what I wanted. I enjoyed the sandwich overall but I think the sauce on it was just mayo and this made it bland. If there was a spiced aoli on there that would have made it outstanding. This is why I rated this meal as a 4 instead of a 5. Service was great and I really enjoyed my meal.",

They really try to give you a New Orleans feel here.  And I give them props for trying to do that in downtown Pittsburgh of all places.  But....the food was ok. There wasn't a whole lot of unique to it.  I mean, one of the specials was a New Orleans styled salad.  Salad.  As a Special.  It's just lettuce and some \"stuff\" in it right?  That's the special?    Adding cajun fries was nice, but it's not what's bringing me back.  The French Onion soup was good, but salty.  The burger I had was very greasy.  The service, outside of the initial promptness was slooooooooow.  I think the waitress forgot to put in our order.  We waited a long time from order to delivery.  The people behind us didn't even get waters for the longest time, and they weren't that busy.  The watress apologized, but still got my mom's salad wrong, as she asked for no onions, but gave them anyways.  Either way, nothing here from preventing me from going back, but I'll probably check out the other restaurants in  Market Square first before going back.",

I had the Brie and leek pasta because it isn't a very common dish to see served at restaurants, and although it was certainly a large enough portion, I found myself wanting more of it!

I chose the gumbo and the pulled pork. The gumbo was pretty tasty, especially when I accidentally dumped a buttload of habanero sauce on it. I thought it was going to be way too spicy to ingest after that snafu, but I think that made it taste better. The sausage in it was absolutely delicious.  The pulled pork sandwich (with onion rings on it, oddly enough) is the best I've had in Pittsburgh thus far. Which is not really a compliment to NOLA as it still wasn't that good and I wouldn't order it again.   The meal also came with voodoo fries. Yum-my. I would order a side of those at any time, they are so good! I don't know what spices they put on them, but they're great.  We ended lunch by sharing some sorbet, mixed berry and peanut butter. The peanut butter one was great, but I am a big lover of all things peanut butter-flavored. It also came with some fried and sugar powder bread that I cannot recall the name of (and can't find on the website!). It was all delicious.  I also upgrade the rating one star because our waiter was kickass. I wish I could remember his name. He was friendly, humorous, came back and checked on us often enough.",

From the poor wait staff, to the over cooked porkchop and sad jambalaya, ending with a 35 minute dessert delivery and silverware washtubs being carried through the dining room I've had enough.   I came into work today and told everyone about how awful is was and how upset I was just to hear they had the same experience a few weeks ago.   The service- I've had good people before however this girl was slow, didn't know the menu, left all of the wine glasses on the table even though I was drinking a martini and the others beers. She didn't check on our table so I had to get up and request a manager to address the over done pork chop. (ordered medium came wayyyy past well- replacement chop was great)   The Jambalaya- just a cheap version of something that used to be amazing. Made with no attention to detail, so much chicken and not enough seafood and andouille. This dish used to be two small chicken wings now they use huge grilled tenders and cut down on the actual meat you're interested in. Something else about the way it tasted was just off-- I feel like they are just cutting corners.   Those are my thoughts--Sorry NOLA but you lost your touch",

A jambalaya that isn't spicy?  That makes as much sense as calling white chocolate chocolate.  They get an extra star for putting in the effort to have frogs legs and alligator on the menu, though the alligator was so drowned in aioli that all you can tell is you're eating fried...something...in aioli.  I got the distinct impression they only have these things on the menu to seem edgy, which is a huge disappointment.  All this with New York prices make for a fairly lame experience.  Granted, this is right in tourist central, but for some reason I was hoping to get more than the usual tourist razzle dazzle and sky-high prices.  I was very wrong.",

They don't know how to shuck them--they were all shriveled and mangled and there was no water in them. On top of that, they were warm, so I have a bad feeling they were not stored correctly. I'll update in two days if I get sick.",

That was where the service ended. It took forever to get our drink order and even longer to take our food order. It was not busy and there appeared to be plenty wait staff. If you have never been to real New Orleans, you probably think that the food is authentic .... not even close and the quality of the preparation was poor.  Even though we commented to one of the waiters that the service was slow, no one even tried to make us feel better about our dining experience. Maybe they don't need the business. Won't be back.",

Interior was honestly pretty gaudy, I understand embracing the New Orleans feel but the sheer quantity of decorations was distracting.  Service was excellent, we were seated and served quickly.  Po' boy sandwiches were good, but dry.  Excellent fries and slaw with the meals.  Soups were among the better choices at our table, especially the oyster stew.  I was a little underwhelmed by spice usage in all of our dishes, I expected more of a punch.  Prices were reasonable considering the location, and the drink selection seemed fair enough.  Pretty tasty food, worth a try if you're hankering for some Cajun, but be cognisant of other options in the immediate area.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for NOLA.  My boyfriend's family lives in New Orleans, and we visit yearly.  When I first walked into NOLA, my first impression was that this is kind of like the Disney World version of New Orleans.  It is over the top, cliche, and kinda cheesy.  That's fine, I can deal with that.  Cheesy can be fun, and the music was great.  I tried to keep a positive attitude.  I ordered a Sazerac, a classic New Orleans cocktail, and it was served warm.  It was also very heavy on the absinthe rinse.  Friends have told me they've had great Sazeracs at NOLA, so I'm hoping this was a fluke.  Next, I tried the alligator appetizer.  It was pretty tasty, but the presentation was not great.  The tiny nuggets of fried alligator were dwarfed by the huge rectangular plate they were served on.  It just seemed like an interesting choice. The red beans and rice dish was pretty awesome, but it wasn't as good as those I've had on the Gulf Coast.  They weren't as thick and creamy, and they were lacking in spice (a bottle of hot sauce fixed that).  Overall, NOLA did not do justice to the awesomeness that is New Orleans cuisine.    I love New Orleans, and I want to love NOLA.  I'll definitely give it a second try.  Some perks:  live music, $5 valet parking after 5 (for all of Market Square), good service, fun ambiance",

Been to NO many a time, and I know what authentic Cajun food tastes like. The food was okay, but I've had better.  Even so, I'd still rate this place fairly high. As I said, authenticity issues aside, the food is okay. The service was definitely over par, so if you're not hung up on the fact that it's not quite what you'd get in the French Quarter, then go there and you'll probably have a good dining experience. The decor and ambiance are definitely high on the cool meter. I'd probably go back.",

    "text": "Ups and downs.  Went on a Saturday night relatively early.  We were excited to get some fried alligator appetizers.  They were out.  Ok, stuff happens.  We were with a party of 10 (pay attention...that'll come back up) and warned that they would add automatic 20% gratuity (ok, no biggie) and would not split the check -- no problem.  A bit tacky, but ok.  We brought a pen to split it ourselves.  Everybody was happy with their entrees, and the soft-shell crab on cucumber (?) gazpacho was OUTSTANDING.  All's well.  Server brings the check -- we're ready!  Pen comes out!  Paying with 4 cards, we split the bill and give her the 4 cards -- put the balance on the last one to cover the tip.  Not sure what the problem was, but there was a minor meltdown.  She ended up grabbing the bill saying \"Ugh, forget it...I'll just split it\" and then came back and threw each of our bills back down on the table.  No exaggeration.  I've never had a bill envelope slammed on the table in front of me.    Guess she got her 20%....so who cares, right?  Look, it's not that hard to split a check for a group.  It's basic restaurant etiquette.We would have let you know up front.  But it wasn't \"allowed.\"  We left slightly offended with a bad taste in our mouths.  I'm....not sure we'll be back.",

While the food is alright, I definitely never feel its worth its cost  [for ~$12 you can get a lunch combo (choose 2-2 of soup, salad, sandwich, fries, etc.)].  In addition, the consistency is definitely not there and every time my food comes out, it looks and tastes like it's sat under a head lamp for at least 10-15 minutes.  The one consistent item I landed on was the Chicken Po-Boy, but alas, on my last journey here they updated their menu and did away with it!  Haven't had a chance to come in the evening for live music, etc., but it seems like it may have some potential for a decent date spot.",

    "text": "I just...wow. It isn't often that I get to enjoy a meal that leaves me content to the point that I don't have the words to describe the level of nirvana I've reached. But my long overdue first visit to Nola managed to do just that.  It admittedly took me way too long to finally eat at Nola's - when they opened I was a broke college student, when I graduated I was a broke graduate, and then for a while I honestly was more in the mood to try the many other new eateries we've seen in the last few years. But finally, they were open and I was craving something different. So a meal at Nola it was.  I came here with my family, and between the four of us we sampled a decent chunk of the menu as we traded a couple appetizers and meals between us. After that I'm pretty convinced you can't go wrong with anything here. I loved absolutely everything I tasted. Our appetizers set the perfect tone for the meal - the Catfish Croquettes simply couldn't contain any more meat or stuffing, while the Fried Green Tomatoes were the freshest and richest I've ever tasted. And my Gumbo Ya-Ya struck me as one of the most unique foods I've eaten, and was full of rice, chicken, and okra - yum!   Even better, after salivating over the appetizers the main courses continued to impress - we sampled the chicken and dumplings and Pork Tenderloin. The first dish contained dumplings that had to have been made fresh and by hand, they were so good - although they paled in comparison to the flavor of the tenderized chicken that came covered with butter and vegetables. But my favorite dish of the night had to be that Pork Tenderloin - the meat practically melted in my mouth, and every bite of marinated pork gave you an amazing explosion of flavor, especially when you piled your fork high with the vegetables and sauces served with it.   What I'm about to say is probably the understatement of the month - but Nola = YUM. And for the most part, the service was just as fantastic; while I wouldn't have minded a faster pace at the end of the meal as we waited for our checks and boxes, they did provide us with plenty of water and kept our tables clear of empty plates throughout the meal itself. It's probably fair to attribute the slight slowdown to the fact that Nola is just very popular and always busy. I'll admittedly have to remember to give myself plenty of time to enjoy a meal at Nola in the future, just in case, so that I'm not late to my post-dinner plans - but it'll be extra time well spent as far as I'm concerned!",

    "text": "I have to rave about this place. A friend and I were out and about on Saturday around 2pm and I really wanted to check NOLA out. We walked in and were seated near the bar at one of the high tables. The first thing I noticed is how much bigger it was on the inside versus what it looked like on the outside. Nice little surprise. I instantly wanted to bop my head to the music and enjoyed looking at the art on the wall. The atmosphere was perfect.  The hostess brought water over and then we had a waitress by the name of Stasha who talked to us about the menu (my first time there) and asked if we were interested in drinks/appetizers. I ordered the Abita Mardi Gras Bock beer and for an appetizer I got Zapp's Potato Chip Crusted Catfish. I was blown away by the flavor/spices of this catfish. It was delicious! Perfectly crispy and a nice, tender flavor on the inside. We were informed that our waitress had a big table she was tending to so we had someone else who came over, introduced themselves, and took our order. Then our lovely waitress came by to make sure our orders were in, which was then brought over by the manager (I believe that's who it was). I ordered seafood jambalaya and let me tell you how much I was in love with it. It had big pieces of shrimp, scallop, sausage, rice, and the spices...ohhh the spices. It was definitely spicy though not overpowering. I loved every bite.  While we were waiting to ask for a to-go box, one of the bartenders walked by and stopped to ask if we needed a box. Good timing. Then Stasha came over and asked us about dessert/got the check. She was so sweet, fun, and had great knowledge of the menu. I definitely appreciated her enthusiasm and interaction with us. One of the great things about this place was the customer service. I mentioned a few different people who came over to help us and they all made our experience that much better. It was the team work that I noticed and loved. You had the hostess, waitress, another waiter, the manager, and a bartender all pitching in for each other, which was so wonderful to see and experience. They did a wonderful job and I'd be more than excited to come back to try other items on the menu.",

    "text": "This is a tough review. A friend and I went to NOLA for dinner this weekend and we had the pierogies for appetizers and I had the jambalaya while she had the shrimp and grits. The appetizers were great but our entrees were SO spicy!   Both my friend and I love spicy foods so it's not a matter of us having a low tolerance for heat. Both of us have eaten at numerous restaurants in New Orleans before and the entrees we both had were so spicy that it bordered on uneatable. That said, it had the *right* spices, just too much of it.  My friend had been craving shrimp and grits and she said while she was managing with the heat, she found the portion of grits to be lacking. Most people would expect a bowl of grits with the shrimps in the center but NOLA makes a grit cake in the shape of a rectangle for its presentation. There was some kind of bacon over the top that did look good. My friend said there was way too much of whatever sauce the shrimp came in so when she finished, there was still a significant puddle of it left over that felt wasteful but she thought it did taste good.  My jambalaya was tomato-based and came in a small cast-iron cassoulet-type bowl. A hearty serving and piping hot temperature-wise too. Flavorful shrimp and scallops were on top while embedded in the rice were sausage and chicken. Trust me, this was a good dish but someone went seriously overboard with the seasoning. Even the next day I ate some and it was still spicy to me and it gave my friend heartburn. I wanted to be a fan of this meal but unfortunately I'm not.",

I was very excited to try this place from what I heard from friends but I was underwhelmed by the food I had. Although the catfish was cooked well it wasn't as flavorful as the name of the dish. It didn't have any kick to it for something described as cajun. I was able to try the grits too and thought it was bland. The aligator bites were good though, very tender. I've never had alligator and it tasted just like calamari! I unfortunately didn't get to try the gumbo that Yelpers rave about.  They had a very enticing menu of special cocktails and I ended up ordering the Bayou royal tea. It was described as having lavender and honey but I couldn't really taste the lavender. It was pretty pricey too imo.",

While I expect fishiness to some degree on crawfish, it was too much and distracting.  I couldn't even eat another slice of the flatbread after the first few bites.  For lunch I got a vegetarian sandwich b/c this was a few weeks after my hh experience and I didn't want to deal with another bad fish ordeal.  So while the sandwich was fine, it was lacking some flavor - granted there's probably only so much you can do with veggies, but come on let's flavor it up a bit, this is supposed to be New Orleans inspired.  I will admit that the fries were delish and perfectly seasoned.  That was the only highlight of my meal and my experience at NOLA.",

The only enjoyable dish here, in my experience, has been the eponymous 'Nola Salad.' It's really a lovely salad - the candied walnuts, arugula and fresh goat cheese are definitely a winning combination.  Unfortunately, everything else suffers from the too much salt, too much grease or too little taste malaise that seems to be the defining characteristic of Nola. Even the jambalaya - their signature dish - was one dimensional and salty.   So.  Long story short:  Is Nola conveniently located in Market Square? Yes, BUT that shouldn't stop you from going to the other excellent restaurants that are in the same area or nearby (Eleven, Sienna). Extra star for the yummy salad.",

I also never felt as though the restaurant was over-crowded, as some restaurants feel when there is a line out the door.  Also, Market Square is a great place to be on a nice afternoon in the Burgh too (or before a show at the theaters nearby).  The menu is more of a northern version of Cajun food than authentic, but there are some interesting appetizer and entree choices, both for the timid and the daring.    My table ordered fried zucchini and alligator apps, and I had the quail for dinner, which was cooked perfectly.  The portions were very generous, and I was not able to finish my entire entree.  One of my friends had the scallop entree, and while it was a bit heavy and rich, it was also fantastic.   Definitely worth a try if you have never been here before.",

Get there and snag a table outdoors  for people watching, this place is frequented by ridiculous drunk middle aged women. I saw a woman take her shoes off grab onto a parking attendant and start running across Market Square.",

I annihalated that sandwhich.  Oh, it came w/ a side of voodoo fries, which were yummy.  Hubs had the salmon and loved it.  We will definitely be back.",

We were quickly greeted by our waitress and learned that brunch was still in session.   My wife ordered the French onion soup and Nola salad and I ordered the pulled pork po' boy sandwich. The salad was amazing (all ingredients complemented each other well and the amount of dressing was just right)   and the soup was average. My pulled pork was juicy and the voodoo fries were delicious though the onion rings topping the sandwich could have been fresher.   With tax & tip we were out the door for $25.",

I've been wanting to get down to NOLA on the square for some time but other places and circumstances put it off until tonight.  I'm not sure if they had a head chef change or leave or what....but this was abysmal by every definition of the word.  The place seemed cool enough on arrival, even though the music at volume level 11 in a place that's acoustically similar to a bathroom made my ears bleed.  We were seated in the dining room directly adjacent to the kitchen and the place was completely empty.  The carpeted floors, decor, and desolate room made me immediately depressed...but hey, I hear the food is Amaze- with a capital A.  Onward and upward.  God do I love fried alligator, yes please, I'll have some.  Fried green tomatoes, MMmmmmMmmmm.  Well, it turns out, the fried gator is rubbery, slightly fishy, and disgusting.  I had 5 bites.  Nothanks.  Ok, fried green tomatoes; can't mess that up right?  Well, they weren't awful, but I can name 5 dive bars with better at half the price soooo.  Main course was the voodoo pasta.  Damn that description sounds delicious, lets recap:  \"Creole Sauce, Garlic Butter, Red Peppers, Spinach, Wild Mushrooms, Parmesan Cheese, Bucatini Pasta\"  Let me put the real description:  \"Can of crushed tomatoes, pasta, no flavor\"  This food would have been bad if it was free, yet it cost me about $70.  I would suggest just going to Eleven or driving to NYC for a better joint.  OH, worth saying, our server was absolutely perfect!  What a shame.  :)  -This review was brought to you by Mr. BlueJay and the letter N",

I am not a major fan of this type of food as it turns out which is disappointing so I'm probably not the best judge of that. That being said, I do like shrimp and grits which I tried here. I thought the grits were a little bland but it was otherwise okay and I would give it another shot if I came: Also, I have had their flatbreads which I did really like and would try again. I'd recommend it to anywhere coming if you don't really like creole. I have had better food in the real NOLA though of course but this isn't bad.   Everything here seemed sort of average to me so while I'd come back if someone else wanted to but wouldn't pick it myself.",

The music was some sort of strange 90s/2000s station where they were playing blink 182, self esteem by the offspring, I just wanna fly, and some other odd tunes to hear at a place that was charging $19.00-$30.00 per dinner entree.   The other reviews were right. Don't come here unless for lunch, its way overpriced for what you get, and it's not that novel.   They're often out of the thing you want, for example, my friend wanted to order stouts, they were all out, he then tried to order two other beers, all out. My other friend wanted the sidecar cocktail.  All out. It was disappointing.    We had a big group, but it took over an hour for our food to come out.  One of the 3 main servers that was helping with our group was nice, the other two were visibly angry that they had to help our group, so it felt like anyone in a group shouldn't eat here unless you want to be resented by the staff.    The food was subpar. Not awful, just not great. I got the $19 chicken and dumplings, where the crispy sage leaves were the best part, overall, just some charred bird in the tiniest bit of gravy. My partner got the margarita flatbread, which had lemons on every slice. It was interesting, but not great. My friend who got the catfish wish the cornbread souffle let me have some, I thought it was very good, decent seasoning and flavor, but small portion.   The gendered bathrooms also didn't seem well tended too. The stalls were out of toilet paper.   All in all, there are better restaurants in the square that'll treat you well with good food and good service. Go to them.",

Service was fine, but the voodoo pasta I got was basically just spaghetti sauce with hot sauce. You could make it yourself with exactly those three ingredients, and not spend more than $5 on them. My boyfriend got the pork tenderloin and sent it back because it was very... very dry. Management replaced it with the andouille flatbread which was ok. Then they gave us a complementary dessert which was, again, ok.  I cannot recommend you go here to eat.  NOLA deserves 2 stars instead of 1 only because of the redeeming quality of the waitstaff's service and management's attempts to make it right.",

So we made brunch reservations to Nola so we could have a few drinks and some good food before we walked over to the baseball game.              We weren't sure if it was going to be busy or not so we made reservations just to be safe.  They opened at 11am and our reservations were at 1115.  We were the first customers to arrive that morning but I'm still glad that we made reservations.  Soon after this it did start to get busy.         We were greeted right away and taken to our seats.  Our waitress was training somebody so we have to girls waiting on us.  I felt a little rushed with our drink orders and looking at the menu.  They gave us a minute to look it over and came right back.  This is usually fine but we really needed a few more minutes.  We both ordered Beermosas!   We used Miller lite and mixed it with our orange juices.  It was a good combination for the morning and a perfect drink right before afternoon baseball.       My wife ended up ordering the Eggs Trivette.  She said it did sort of remind her of an eggs benedict.  She liked it.  I really wasn't hungry for breakfast food right then so I ordered their Nola Burger.  That really hit the spot for me.  It's a big burger with cheese, cornmeal fried green tomatoes, and onion marmalade.  It was juicy and delicious!  My hamburger came with their Voodoo fries.  They were seasoned very well and I enjoyed the fries.  This early lunch was really good and it was the perfect combination right before the Pirate game.       Overall we did have a good brunch.  I wasn't that big of a fan over their brunch menu but my wife did like hers.  The lunch and dinner menus are probably more for me which is why I really enjoyed my burger.",

I should've known when our waiter in training (who greeted us with \"how are y'all doing tonight\" on Easter Sunday morning) said it was his favorite....  hubby liked his fried alligator po boy (but commented that bc it was so breaded he couldn't taste the alligator (which to me may have been a good thing?), and girls were satisfied with their french toast and vegetable cheese omelet.  The fruit that accompanied it was standard cut up melon and pineapple and grapes, like what you might get at a hotel's free breakfast buffet (aka institutionally packaged). Beignets were lukewarm and underwhelming, as was my coffee.  I chose this place at the last minute from a short list of available open brunch places for Easter... so I was grateful they were open but bottom line disappointed in the food and wouldn't recommend it.  Positives- reasonable prices, big space, and lots of tables.",

We went with a large group which sometimes means dinner can take a long time, but I didn't feel like we were a struggle for the restaurant.   A bunch of us tried the fried alligator which was very delicious.  I'm a huge fan of duck and pretty much get it anywhere we go, and NOLA was no exception.  It was cooked well and they even made the swiss chard taste good.  I ate everything.  The sweet potatoes were legendary.  I would love to figure out how to make my own version of these.  To finish we all ordered beignets with ice cream or sorbet and they were delicious.   We definitely left with a hefty bill, but the food was worth it.",

    "text": "NOLA is a can't-miss for all you adventurous diners. There are definitely some unique options on the menu. I was skeptical, but any restaurant that offers a vegetarian/vegan menu earns some brownie points automatically. The decor exudes an upbeat, jazzy atmosphere to complement their New Orleans vibe. I'm a sucker for unique restaurant themes, no matter how corny.   They provide lunch specials where you can mix and match soup, salad, and sandwiches, but unfortunately, the vegetarian selections are not included in this deal. I ordered the Spinach Summer Salad to start and it was delicious. Fresh and fruity with a nice crunch from the almonds. After cleaning off the salad, it was time for the Vegan Rice Creole. Amazing!! It's essentially rice mixed with a tomato salsa topped with carrots and peas. I know it sounds a bit off, but trust me, it's phenomenal. The portion is also big enough for a second meal which is always a plus.   Oh, by the way, the voodoo fries are a must! I'm not sure what dark magic they use to season the fries, but I couldn't stop eating them until every last one was gone. Insanely addicting!",

We started with the sangria and it was the best I've ever had!  So, my wonderful date and I had a few more of those smooth wonders. Then for the appetizer:  The fried green tomatoes were amazing. Not sure what the sauce is that comes with them but it makes them pop.  A wedge salad was very good then for the main course I ordered the trout and he went for the jumbalia (can't spell it, but you know what I mean). Totally hot and spicy, it was almost too much for me! My boyfriend and I like to share dishes so we switched mid dinner.  The trout was mild and the rice with it was a great contrast to the hot hot hot Jumba- you know- the Brussel sprout side dish that came with the trout was the only disappointing part of the meal. An odd horseradish sauce made them just not good enough to finish.  A server with a less than sweet attitude was okay but provided good service.  The fun artwork added a nice touch. We definitely recommend this place and will be back again! Thanks Nola.",

My latest foray to NOLA was for drinks before a late dinner. So let's move on...   Atmosphere: Love the atmosphere at NOLA, it's why I continue to come back! I've been to New Orleans and it definitely takes me back. It has all the pomp and circumstance that I expect of the Big Easy. The one downfall was when I was visiting they had a jazz musician singing and while the music was fantastic, it was so loud I couldn't hear or talk to my date unless we were screaming at each other.   Service: Our bartender was fantastic! He chatted us up and answered questions we had about the drink menu. Made and muddled my drink in front of us. The drawbacks were the one drink is actually hard to drink bc there is so much stuff muddled into it, and then when I ordered wine they were out of wine glasses for a solid 30 minutes. For a busy downtown bar / restaurant, how do you run out of wine glasses?! Needless to say, neither ruined my experiences with our night, just minor inconveniences.   Drinks: Solid beer draft choice. Drink list was very interesting, but like I said above, it was hard to drink one of their cocktails because there was so much in it. Wine list was solid.   All in all, I'm always going to make NOLA a stop.",

    "text": "We visited Nola on Saturday night for a late dinner with friends.  Overall, I was incredibly impressed with the service and the food.  My husband had the jambalaya which was appropriately spicy but I thought the tomato sauce was a bit to acidic.  However, the chef did accommodate my husband's request to substitute more scallops for shrimp (he doesn't like shrimp).  My husband also tried the frog legs which he said were OK but not great.  I tried the sauce and the sauce was spicy and very tasty.  I had the filet mignon with swiss chard and squash puree.  The steak was perfectly prepared and the squash puree was creamy and delish!  I didn't eat all the greens because I'm not a big fan of swiss chard - however, the greens were appropriately prepared and not overcooked.  We also tried the butternut squash soup with crawdad tails.  I felt it was under-salted, but otherwise tasty.  Our friends really enjoyed the duck pasta and the mushroom bread pudding.  They had ordered the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer, but it didn't appear until our meals had arrived.  Our server was gracious and had it removed from our bill.  The creme brulee is amazing and the panna cotta was outstanding!  One thing that impressed me the most was that the manager came over to check on us several times.  He also had a very thorough knowledge of the whiskey selection and was able to give our friend several very good alternatives to suit her palette.  The beer selection was decent if you're a hop head (which I am).  However, if you aren't into hops, you might find yourself unable to find a suitable beer.  I asked for a table that was near the band but not too close as to preclude any conversation.  I'm happy to say that our table was close enough the music for us to enjoy it and still be able to hear our friends.  Overall, I was incredibly impressed with Nola.  The inconsistent Yelp reviews made me squeamish about visiting, but I'm very glad that I did.  The restaurant is pricey, but the portions are decent and the food is quite good.  This is not the place to go if you have some place to be.  However, if you're in the mood for some music and a leisurely meal, I would recommend Nola.  One thing to remember, don't expect to show up on a weekend and get a table.  Reservations are a must!",

It was simple but delicious and huge for the price. I had the jambalaya which was also very good. Our server was very courteous and made some good recommendations. My only complaint is that they were out of quite a few things- such as scallops and the fish of the day- and the kitchen seemed to be annoyed at our substitutions for the out of stock seafood. We heard one chef or cook admonish our waitress for allowing us to substitute catfish for scallops in jambalaya. If you are out of multiple menu items, it is only reasonable to allow some leeway with otherwise inappropriate substitutions. We did get our catfish but the chef could have been a little more accommodating to the server's request. Overall though, it was a really great meal.",

    "text": "Three stars for our waitress, alone! She was absolutely amazing! But the food took entirely too long to come out, was really expensive, and REALLY mediocre. We came because of their \"vegan menu,\" but they only had rice available for my vegan coworker. Both of my boss' steaks came out overcooked. The jambalaya tasted spicy, yet lacked flavor (think El Monte canned tomato paste mixed with raw peppers). My other coworker had the shrimp and grits and had to force herself to finish, as it was over-seasoned. I hope our phenomenal waitress takes her talent somewhere that deserves it! I would not come again, at these prices.",

This used to be one of my favorite lunch/dinner spots for memorable and delicious cuisine. However; ever since the menu/head chef was changed, the menu appears to have nose dived. The frog leg appetizer portion has been cut in half and covered in an unnecessary sauce. The soup cups were so shallow, I only got a thimble's worth of broth. Lastly, my pulled pork sandwich was 60% un-chewable fat. I had noticed that the appetizers were lacking during a recent happy hour, and I had written it off as a one-time fluke. Sadly, it appears that the menu quality as a whole is not what it used to be. Can't say I'll be going back.",

The sauce drizzled on the lightly battered, crispy pieces of alligator tail meat has the right amount of kick to make you close your eyes and go, \"yummmm\" and secretly wish that your dinner buddies that you are sharing this with would disagree and not eat a lot of the crunchy, fried alligator bites and so you can devour them all.  Well, that ain't happening! It is THAT good! I got the quail as dinner. I didn't want a piece of blackened fish or something that I could make myself! So quail it was! The bed of wild rice and oyster dressing is delicious. The quail itself is juicy with a crispy skin.  One of my friends raved about the gumbo. Another had the cornmeal crusted tilapia (special) of the night. The cooking here is done very very well. The cornmeal crust is just perfect, crusty, yet juicy fish on the inside. The experience is truly great and kinda unique. The bar is crazy busy, the seating area is vibrant with people of all ages enjoying their food. A happy crowd is always a sign of a great restaurant.  The portions here are more on the Pittsburgh portion side. The place has valet parking, I didn't know about it until I parked, so don't know the details. There are quite a few garages around Nola.",

It needed a bit more of a kick, so they provided hot sauce, but that's really not the same. As mentioned in the other reviews, the red beans and rice was amazing, and the quail that my brother got was awesome. My problem came with the ambiance, the price, and the beignets. Even though my group was seated in the dining area, the jazz music overwhelmed any conversation that may have been had. We also got the beignets for dessert and they were more cake-y and dense than any other beignets I've had, resulting in a really underwhelming desert. On top of that, the price was a bit high for the quality of food. I would recommend this place more for the bar and music than for the restaurant end.",

Fortunately for them, the lack of New Orleans authenticity didn't take away from the fact that the food was tasty.  I'll definitely go back  to indulge in some Abita (since it's not an easy find in Pittsburgh) and perhaps the alligator, but I think I'll leave the other dishes for when I go back to New Orleans!",

The other plates I could see around me looked generous, big sandwiches, lots of fries, or a big bowl salad and half a sandwich on the side.  My entree was more expensive than the sandwich plates, and  it came with ... nothing.  I got a gigantic plate-bowl with about half a cup of grits and four shrimp in the bottom.  An appetizer sized portion at best, and no bread, crackers, salad or anything else.  The grits were bland and runny, and the shrimp was overcooked and too salty.  Basically, this \"main course\" was a small cup of mediocre soup for $20.",

Thats ok, I ordered the craw-fish... waitress said, I am sorry, we are out of craw-fish. Again New Orleans based restaurant without shrimp nor craw-fish. I then ordered the pulled pork sandwich that stated it came with onion rings on top, literally, one onion ring. The sandwich was cold, the bun was hard. Ohhh and when I tried to go healthier with fruit cup. Sorry, we are out of fruit cup, I went with the fries, please change your oil more then once every six months please. We also ordered the Gumbo and flatbread. Those were not to bad, but we had to ask for silverware and napkins. The restaurant was not crowded at all, there was no reason why we needed to ask for utensils. So disappointed. Please try another restaurant before stopping here.

    "text": "I went for the first time for an early dinner around 4:30 PM on Sunday prior to going to see a show at Heinz Hall.  We opted to sit inside instead of outside to avoid the cigarette smoke coming from people smoking outside the restaurant but nearby to the outdoor seating.  My cousin has been here many times and loves it and we've traveled to New Orleans together around 20 times over the last 15 years so I was excited that she recommended it so highly.  The restaurant has a fairly extensive cocktail, beer, and wine list and my cousin ordered a beer but I ordered a glass of wine and felt that the pour was very small for the price.  For our appetizers and main courses, she ordered the gumbo and the BBQ shrimp (from the appetizer menu) and I ordered the Cajun chowder and was torn between the shrimp and grits and the scallops and shrimp mac daddy, but upon our servers recommendation and because I'm a sucker for shrimp and grits, I went with the shrimp and grits (which at least another reviewer mentioned that it is really overpriced at $27 - believe me, the quality of the grits and the amount of shrimp that you get for the $27 is far from worth the money).  My cousin tried my chowder and I tasted her gumbo and I found the flavors of both the be tasty though I felt that the gumbo was a little under-seasoned while the chowder was flavorful but overly salty.  Our main courses arrived and again we shared a taste of each other's dishes.  The BBQ shrimp was very flavorful but again overly salty and the shrimp and grits were a mixed bag in my opinion.  The sauce on top of the grits with the shrimp was the same as the sauce on the BBQ shrimp plus it had the addition of very salty bacon yet the grits on their own were rather bland and even mixing them together to mingle the flavors did not cut down on the excessive saltiness in the dish.  I am someone who actually prefers my food on the saltier side so the mere fact that I am actually complaining about how salty everything was means that it was quite over salted.  I could feel my ankles swelling as the meal came to a close.  We also shared the beignets for dessert.  The trio of sorbet that came with the beignets was delicious and refreshing and but the beignets were a little flat and dense compared to the beignets that I've had in New Orleans but tasty.  Overall I would go back but I would probably keep to the lower priced items because I feel that much of their menu is overpriced for what you get.",

We were there for almost two hours since it took  so long for food and she came to out table three times.  We had to ask the manager where our food was after an hour.  It was a Sunday and the restaurant was about a third full. The 'bone-in' short ribs was a fatty pot roast (literally sitting in a clear pool of fat on my platter) there were no bones or flavor.  The grits had a dried layer on top from sitting under a heat lamp. I used to frequent Nola when it opened. It was great and I don't know what happened.",

I live in Atlanta and theyhelped me execute my Dad's 75th bday party last weekend even while planning from a remote location!   We used the speakeasy upstairs and It wasan event for 30 close friends and family.  The setup was awsome, service was fun and lively, food reviews were very good.   Our menu consisted of Crab cakes and Fried green tomatoes, Crab Bisque, Salad, Lemon Catfish, the Filet, and the Pasta. Everyone loved the fish and the filet. The pasta was a little spicey for most to finish but they still said it was good.   As far as the service, Joyce and Matt were AMAZING and formed great connections with my hostess crew. They also helped us transform the room to a True harlem rennesance type of look and made our set up and breakdown smooth and easy. We brought, in our own desserts bar and Nola supported with brining out the birthday cake. We had music in room and people could flow downstairs for the live music if they chose. Lukily we were fun enought that no one did. :-)   I do wish they had free wii fi to facilitate the music but that was a minor issue since I have a mobile hotspot.   Overall I'm very excited at the end results and Truely appreciate Jackie, Jen, Joyce, and Matt for helping me give Daddy an awsome memory! Go team Nola!",

We should've braved the cold...drinks were ok, I liked my Cajun Martini which had a little kick of jalepeno, that's why it gets two stars instead of one...the catfish appetizer was tasty but very small portion to share, and I was really looking forward to the Shrimp Po Boy since I haven't had a good one in years (in Pittsburgh)...well, it's mostly bun...and slaw/tomato 'filler' ...the bun was tough and cold, and the 4 shrimp on top were heavily breaded and not too tasty...I ate one off the top and sent it back.  Definitely not a $14 sandwich.  My friend said her burger was just \"ok\"..and she was never asked how she wanted it cooked...it came medium rare.  So with four drinks, a burger and appetizer our bill was $70.  With lackluster service (waiter was not very friendly), and the kitchen's inability to get even a simple 'signature' sandwich right...I'll never return.",

There was a live band playing, and they were decent, but very loud to the point where it was pretty difficult to hear my date.  I got the salmon etoufee as my entree - I asked them to cook it medium rare, because so often I find that my dishes are slightly over cooked.  When it came out, it was definitely very rare - basically just quickly seared on both sides.  Now, I love raw salmon/sushi - so this actually didn't bother me as much as the average person, but both the seasoning and the sauce that it was in was very salty - and I love salty foods.  Though enjoyable, I don't think that this would be a destination for me, unless I happened to be in the downtable/Market Square area.",

    "text": "Big time Bummer.  This would have been my fourth time going to NOLA for lunch and the first time that I have eaten at the tables as opposed to the bar-top.  We got in before the lunch-rush hit and were seated quickly and in a friendly manner.  Our waiter was quick to ask about out interests in food, take our drink order and walk is through the menu.  Service was good, so that wasn't the issue, the issue here was the food.  I ordered the Chicken Po Boy Sandwhich with a fruit salad instead of fries.  The whole meal was a disappointing, I only ate it because I was hungry and I didn't even do a good job at finishing my plate.  The chicken on the sandwich was dry, not oops it was grilled too long fry but oh dear me this might get stuck in my throat dry.  From there it was a series of unfortunate events.  The bread wasn't up to par with past sandwiches had and I stand by the thought that the bread to content ratio for the particular menu item is skewed in the favor of the bread.  The sausage was good but there was not enough kick to salvage the palate.  I can't remember if there was tomato or lettuce or any other veggie in it mostly because the biggest bummer overpowered the whole entree--the mustard.  It was there in dollops and it wasn't good in its own merit adding to the dryness of the whole sandwich.  Lastly, I chose the fruit salad in lieu of fries ... it was warm.  Now I understand if it's at room temperate in an air conditioned setting like the dining area ... but it was hot kitchen room temperature and biting into it didn't release cooler juices that might have survived the onslaught of the ambient heat in the back.  So that was a big bummer.  I hate that I didn't like the food because my first three times were very good experiences.  When I do return, I'll have to try a different lunch entree since I don't want to risk another Po-saster.",

This is made up for by the amazing band that was playing and the general ambiance of market square. Many people stopped to take pictures of the restaurant, patio, and band. This restaurant really adds to the market square environment.   We were told to grab any open seat on the patio since the indoor seating area was unavailable due to our lack of a reservation. This did not bother us and they were polite. The draft beer selection was good and their \"house\" IPA was decent. The alligator starter is crispy and smothered in a zesty sauce. Good stuff! The pork chop was huge and worth the price. Overall we loved this place due to the good food, service, and environment. Check it out while it is still warm.",

The crawfish & sherry soup was tasty, more of a bisque with chunks of crawfish.  I had the fried gator tail.  Panko breaded chunks of tail with a beautiful creamy, but spicy sauce - the meat was fresh and sweet.    For our entrees we had the Scallops Mac Daddy - Beautifully prepared and the scallops were huge and perfectly done. I had the wood roasted quail. Two complete quail that were again perfectly done although my wife thought just a  tad over salted.",

Waited a full five minutes for the server to come after a food runner delivered apps, he never showed. Had to get up and go looking for him so we could have some plates.  Server took our silverware after we finished the appetizers, didn't give us new. Had to take them from a neighboring table because he went MIA again. The menu is heavily overpriced, the food is nice but definitely not worth the prices. Disappointing in that regard.  This place could be really fun and cool, it's trying so hard to be upscale and it's just so not. It's a Cajun/creole place, to me them atmosphere should be all about that. Fun, good zydeco music.....something?? Service was poor at best. We won't be back, too many great places downtown to eat that get it. We wanted to like it!",

Great music too, and the drinks were very good as well. Unfortunately, the food didn't blow us away. It was above average, just not great. Personally, I would have liked to see the catfish cooked a little more (you can't be too careful when it comes to undercooked seafood), but it was flavorful. Overall, I'd rate the total experience at 3.5 to 3.75 stars if Yelp would let me, and would give NOLA another shot if in the area.",

I had the chopped salad and added chicken to it.  Such delicious flavors!  And it was topped with a HUGE chunk of blue cheese! Plus had hush puppy croutons.  One of my friends had the French onion soup and was full about halfway through it.  The other had a flat bread pizza, she customized it a bit, but the waiter forgot that when he put the order in.  Told us that he goofed and had sent it back, and promptly brought out the corrected order.  The service was wonderful.

From the front (and even in the bar area), it appears fairly small, but once you enter, there is a large dining room way in the back.  We visited on a Friday night without a reservation, so we waited about 15 minutes before a table in the bar was available.  Despite being very crowded, service was fantastic and friendly.  The downside was that it was VERY loud.  Especially once the band started.  We had the gumbo and rice and beans as our appetizers.  Both were fantastic and had a little bit of a kick.  The grit cake and the shrimp and grits were both amazing.  My one complaint is that the prices are quite high.  The food is high quality and the environment great, but $25 for shrimp and grits did seem a bit extreme.  I will be back!",

I hadn't tried cajun food before so I was super excited to try this place. I came right after lunch rush hour so we got seated right away. The waiter was quick and made recommendations. I ordered the Jambalaya which had shrimp, scallops, chicken, and sausage! It was super yummy with its tomato spicy sauce. I recommend this plate when the weather is NOT hot. The plate was super hot so it was hard to enjoy. Either way I recommend this place.",

    "text": "The food would have been a 2, but the service and management were a 5, so I settled for 3, and hope to let them redeem themselves.  Here goes... First, we were seated early on a busy Friday night, and they did it with a smile.  The waiter was prompt and efficient.  Our appetizer was boudin.   Now, we are truly Cajun food foodies.  We throw a Cajun food fest every year in our town, and we have dined in some of the finest shacks in NOLA.  We KNOW from Cajun food.  This was not it.  First thing I said was, \"how do you eat boudin without saltines?\"  All jest aside, though, it wasn't right.  The boudin was in ball form, which is fine, but it didn't have enough liver.  It didn't have the good boudin funk.  It was sweet, which was weird, and not very flavorful.   I asked for hot sauce, and they brought me Tabasco ....crystal would have been better, but, whatever.  Second course for me was red beans and rice for me.  Serviceable, not great.  I like big hunks of andouille in mine.   This had none.  It was listed as an ingredient, but I couldn't find it.  Phil got a \"smoked \" Cesar salad with white anchovies.  The dressing reminded me of a creamy dressing you would get at the Colonnade in Atlanta....a rich southern old white guy's restaurant....creamy and flavorless.   Finally, I was very excited about the main course.  The special fish was wolf fish which is an eel-y type thing that has terribly flavorful flesh.  Unfortunately, I finally had to complain (which, believe me, I never do).  I think Lot's wife would have become human again next to this dish.  It was so salty that Phil, who LOVES salty food, said it made his mouth turn inside out.  I tried to make it work by eating the fish with the greens, but the greens were just as bad.   It was inedible.  The side of mushroom and crab Mac and cheese was ok, so I ate that.  Phil's Mack daddy duck had an excellent duck confit on top, but the pasta was really sweet.   He ate all the duck, but the pasta was just kind of gross.     So, they get up starred because of the service.  When I finally broke down and told the waiter that the food was inedible, he was quite apologetic.  I explained that we didn't want anything, but that we felt the chef should know that the fish special was terrible.  It was early in the night, and it could be fixed.  He then brought the manage over, and he apologized.  Again, I explained that it was fine, we just wanted to let the chef know.  Eventually, they actually comped my meal.  That gesture by the waiter and manage,net is enough to make me think that it's worth another shot sometime.   Anyplace that is willing to listen and cop to their mistakes is a place that I'm willing to revisit.  Hopefully next time I'll have a better experience.",

That's not to say that the food isn't good - it is good.  It's just not as Cajun/Creole as it should be.  I started with the Abita Amber (which they have on tap!).  We then ordered frog legs and the alligator to start.  Both of these were solid.  The frog legs seemed fresh, and the gator was not chewy.  The sauce that came with both of these dishes were tasty with a little zing.  I had the seafood mac and cheese, which had lobster, crab, and crawfish in it.  The flavor of this dish was great, and the cheese bits that got darkened under the broiler were to die for.  Please note, though, that the locals down in NOLA don't eat lobster...  I'd love to see an etouffee added to the menu.",

It feels quite European. Anyway, we wandered around looking for a lunch spot and found this place. The lunch price looked pretty reasonable so we decided to just go with it.   Both my coworker and I decided to get the half sandwich with fries and a soup. I had a French onion soup and the pulled pork sandwich. Sometimes with these lunch deals the sandwiches are so small, but not in this case. It was a good portioned half sandwich, plus a full side of fries. Oh god their fries are so good, like the Cajun fries at Five Guys since it's covered in spices. My French onion soup I didn't like much though. All the cheese kind of gooped up together in the bowl and it was hard to eat. I hate having to bite down on stringy melty cheese like I'm eating noodles. My coworker had the gumbo and the turkey cuban and he said it was really good, and filling.   Being a New Orleans food, the food wasn't very spicy. But our waiter told us that they don't do it as spicy as True Cajun food, because I guess most of their customers aren't used to that amount of spice.   Great lunch spot with their lunch deal. I was definitely way too full after this lunch. I just can't resist them fries.",

We thought NOLA was New Orleans cuisine and didn't realize it was a very tame version of everything they have listed on the menu. The jambalaya wasn't very flavorful and the \"blackened\" catfish didn't have enough blackened seasoning and was actually charred/burned on the edges, so only the center was edible. The voodoo fries were good, but also didn't have enough cajun seasoning on them.  The wait staff and manager were wonderful. The manager sent out a dessert to make up for it and explained that everything is made to order, so next time we'll ask them to make it spicier like real New Orleans food.  If you go there expecting real New Orleans food, I recommend you ask them to make whatever you order spicier.",

Its surely the only place that I know of in the city the offers it, and every time is just like the first time. Today we stopped in for happy hour and we're delighted to find a handful of appetizer items for $4, small sides for $1 and half off flatbreads. Get the Peato Crawfish flatbread if you can.

For food, I tried the soup or salad, voodoo fries, and sandwich pairing. WOW. The voodoo fries blew me away, the alligator po boy was exotic and delicious, and the gumbo ya-ya was incredible. For such a cheap price, it was a lot of high quality food. The wait staff is incredibly attentive too. For the live performances, NOLA lights up market square.

If a drink is going to cost $9-$10 I would love to be able to truly taste the liquor in it.   I ordered the shrimp Poboy with voodoo fries (which are fries that are seasoned). Honestly, the sand which was average - there wasn't anything that made me go \"wow!\" Or that it stood out. It still was good though!

    "text": "I came here on the day after my birthday because I am on the mailing list for this restaurant group. And as part of that you actually get a $25 certificate to use at any of the restaurants that they have. I mean, how good is that? I have been on the list for a few years now and have never used this perk. Am I an idiot or what? Anyways this year I thought, well, lets start 34 off a little different and use a coupon. We took an Uber down to Market Square. I suggest everyone who is trying to go here to just get an Uber or Lyft and not worry about parking. There is nothing worse than trying to find a parking spot when you know your reservation is soon. Yeah, they have valet and parking garages, but why spend the money and have to drive yourself home (aka no drinking) if you can just request an Uber. Seems like a no brainer to me.   Sadly I did not indulge in a drink, but after the two weeks of celebrating my birthday, it wasn't that big of deal. The table was ready right when we got there and the service was top notch like usual. Our hostess was really nice and even indulged us a bit when we considered sitting outside instead of inside. We opted to sit inside, as a side not, I am not a big fan of sitting outside usually, especially in the dark, so, we sat inside near the kitchen where we usually head to anyways. Another sad part of Sunday was that there wasn't any live music. I would have liked to hear some fine tunes while I ate.   Starters: Oysters: A foursome or dozen; wood roasted bbq or raw half shell. I of course ordered this and of course ate it all myself. Yeah, my partner is not really into the whole raw oyster thing and I absolutely love them. I will eat them each and every day if I could. I will say that they had a little bit of a different take on the cocktail sauce which I do not know how I really feel about. And they then had some sort of red pepper jam cocktail sauce that I liked, but it wasn't what I was used to. While good, I think that they were a little bit small in size for the price. I may not get them again, but that night I was happy I did.   Salad: Cajun Cobb Salad: Romaine, Tasso Ham, Edamame, Cucumber, Radish, Point Reyes Blue Cheese, Hard Boiled Egg, Tomatoes, House Made White Balsamic Vinaigrette. I wanted a salad but not a large one and the server suggested that I just get a side salad of any of the salads that they had on the menu. While smaller it was also just $3 less than the original price for the usual portion. If I knew that I would have just gotten the regular sized salad and brought some home with the dressing on the side. The cobb was good. Nothing out of the ordinary or outstanding. A solid salad for sure.   Dinner: Seafood Jambalaya: Cajun Rice, Chicken, Wild Caught Shrimp, Sea Scallops, Andouille Sausage. So the server asked if I liked spicy food. My answer was, sometimes. So he suggested that instead of the cajun rice I get the white rice. He said that the cajun rice had a lot of the spice in it and if I was not in the mood for a 6 on a scale of 1-10 then maybe to skip it. I took his advice and I think that next time I might ask for a mixture of the white and cajun rice. The dish was good but it lacked something, maybe the spice? It just needed a bit more to make it a real mouthwatering moment. The dish also came out so hot, its in a skillet, that it took a good bit of time to cool down. The shrimp was plump and juicy and the sea scallops were amazing. I was not the biggest fan of the shredded chicken, it tasted a little dry to me. It was a solid dish but I would hesitate to get it again.   12oz New York Strip Steak. Loaded Mashed Potatoes, Sauteed Leeks, Wild Mushrooms, Demi-Glace. This really stole the show. I do not know how a steak could taste this good but boy, did it. I had more than a few bites of this steak and would have been ok if I too ordered it. My partner got the mashed potatoes but then substituted the leeks and mushrooms for peas and edamame. The mashed potatoes were amazing. They were just so good. And I cannot tell you enough good things about how well the steak was done and how juicy it was. YUM.  We took leftovers home for both of the dishes and ate for another day. It was a great time and it was even better with that $25 dollar off discount. AND!!! Nola is part of the Yelp Cash Back, so I was super surprised to see money in my account on Yelp! I totally forgot about that and it was a nice surprise. So come here with family and friends, sign up for their newsletter, and link the card you are going to use so you get cash back! Its really a great deal for a great place to eat!",

We came on a Friday night with a live band and the noise was so deafening that my ears hurt. I'm not the type of person to write average reviews; I usually only ever heap praise or damnation where it is warranted. If you come here starving for a filling meal, you may be disappointed.

I love that they have outdoor seating. The restaurant looks tiny from the outside, but it is surprisingly big inside. I enjoy the jazz style music they play, really makes you feel like you're eating somewhere in the French quarter. I recommend the voodoo pasta. It's really good with the perfect amount of spice, full of vegetables and I suggest adding shrimp. The shrimp are jumbo and grilled to perfection.  I am looking forward to going back sometime soon!",

However, Logan at Nola made everything all better with his attentive and sincere service!  Foodwise, I could give the chef a few tips on fried green tomatoes. Like many other restaurants, the batter was a bit heavy (at home I dip the tomatoes in milk and corn meal just to add a little crunch without overwhelming the tomato).  And cheddar cheese topping?  How about pimento cheese or remoulade sauce to stay in that Creole genre?  In contrast, the roast chicken and dumplings were best in class!  Off the BBQ tasty roast chicken, light dumplings, and carrots, mushrooms and peas in a light tarragon sauce!  Heavenly!  My only regret is that I'm traveling and couldn't take the leftovers home for lunch tomorrow.  So thank you, Logan, for restoring my faith in Pittsburgh waitstaff, and thank you, Nola Chef, for the sublime roast chicken!  I'll do a free consult on the fried green tomatoes if you like....",

They do have multiple veggie/vegan options - Ask for their veggie/vegan menu! The names of their dishes are interesting - Voodoo pasta, for instance, but the dish itself was plain old spaghetti in red sauce and veggies! It wasn't bad, just that for $18, I was expecting something I couldn't whip up in my own kitchen relatively easily. The cauliflower soup was nice and comforting but again, nothing spectacular. Same with the friend tomatoes, stuffed mushrooms and my two cocktails. Service too is just about okay! I waited too long for my drinks and my check.. when the restaurant wasn't even full! That it isn't full on a Friday evening is telling... All in all, I had an ok meal, not bad.. but just nothing I'd want to go back again for.",

    "text": "I would have to agree with some of the other reviews about NOLA. I experienced much of what was reflected in other reviews. My 4 star rating comes mostly from the overpriced food, and generic desire to provide customer service to us as I will explain.  A group of us (6) made reservations for 8:45pm on a Saturday night.  We arrived early and had a drink at the bar after we checked in with the hostess. 8:45pm came and went and at around 9:05 we began to wonder why we haven't been seated yet. Finally around 9:30 we finally sat down. A whole 45 minutes past our reservation time, I find this unacceptable because there where numerous open tables on the other side of the restaurant. Also the management and staff constantly asked us if we were doing good and having fun etc. I find this approach to be like walking into a department store and someone is breathing down your neck. When I made the correlation that their approach was generic was when the waitress spilled my wife's glass of wine on the table. Rather than simply asking \"what kind of wine she had,\" and replacing it with a full glass. She actually asked how much was left in the glass and brought her another glass that was approximately a half serving of wine. Slightly tacky in my opinion. It really seemed as if they could have used more waitstaff for the dinning room.  The food was pretty good but I seriously believe that it was a little bit on the high $ side. I also thought that their menu was lacking some other staple Cajun dishes such as etouffee, boudin, boiled crawfish. Although they did have frog legs on the menu which I tried, have to say they were good. And alligator. I did think that it was weird that they did have things on the menu labeled as Cajun like Salmon??? I also tried the shrimp and grits and scallops Mac Daddy. I thought that the shrimp and grits while flavorful did not have the correct consistency of True grits. I also thought that this dish represented more of a \"Southern style cooking\" rather than New Orleans / Cajun.  And for $26 which I knew was high in the first place. The scallops Mac daddy was definitely the Mac Daddy. Very good rich dish with perfectly cooked scallops.",

A 7:15 reservation became an 8:00 when we were forced to hover over an outside table waiting for the group to leave. We thought the four-top was incredibly rude as they lingered over their completed and cleared meal until we realized they were still waiting for their check. They immediately produced a credit card only to wait another fifteen minutes for the waitress to return. We then got the same waitress and the same level of service. No manager inquiry and only painfully uneven service. The food--at least the things they weren't out of--was good. But I'll try again on a quieter night.",

What impressed us most the first time, the quality of the service and the food, impressed us once again.  I had jambalaya (again) and my wife had the blackened redfish.  We both loved our meals, even though we took home a lot of them.  Anton, our server was very attentive and evened offered to hold our left-overs until after the show we were attending.  We asked to be seated in the back, away from the bar and were taken to an attractively decorated room off to the side and well away from the noise of the bar.  From my seat, I even had a bit of a view into the workings of the kitchen.  We remarked that the noise level was actually lower than what we usually experience in other restaurants.   We had recommended NOLA to several friends, and the feedback we got from them wasn't positive.  Some complained about the service and  everyone complained about the noise level.  Our seating in the back would explain the difference in the noise level, but regarding the difference of opinion as to the service,  that I can't explain. All I know is that on both visits, service was superb.   We'll try not to wait so long for our next visit!",

We got sat at a high top table in the front of the restaurant, and had ordered drinks shortly after. The manager came up to us about 5 minutes later to ask if we wouldn't mind moving to their dining room because the table we were sat at was reserved. We didn't mind, especially when he offered to pay for our first round of drinks!!   We ordered the gator bites for an appetizer, which were amazing! Neither of us had had gator before, and it defied our expectations! The breading and seasoning was so delicious. For our meal, we both ordered the gumbo and a Shrimp Po Boy sandwich to share. We got the gumbo first and it was so simple, but had tons of flavor!! There was tons of okra in it, which is one of my favorite vegetables. Then came the Po Boy! Which is huge, btw. The shrimp were easily the size of tennis balls, lightly fried, with a slaw sauce and I'm pretty sure their bread is homemade. To top off that sandwich, were easily the best French fries I had ever had. My boyfriend & I are French fry junkies. We both agreed this was #1 on our top French fry list!   If you are in this area, I definitely recommend Nola, if you like New Orleans type food. I wish this restaurant was closer to where I live so I could eat here all the time!!",

The fully stocked bar always has a \"relevant to the season\" selection of Craft Brews and the staff is courteous, knowledgeable and professional. They offer a New Orleans Nouveau Creole menu with live jazz on select evenings. The outdoor seating with a view of the bustling Market Square presents a wonderful atmosphere (if you're lucky to get a seat) on a hot summer day while the interior provides a feeling of being in a tavern on Bourbon Street (I know, I've been there too).  A couple of days ago during my lunch break I had a hankering for something spicy so I headed over to Nola's and ordered up a serving of the jambalaya. It took only about ten minutes for a hot cast-iron dish to be placed in front of me filled with shrimp, scallops, chicken, andouille, veggies and of course beans and \"dirty\" rice. The spices blended together to make the meal flavorful without being too spicy... a delicate line to tow.  It was truly delicious; I know I'll be back again. Perhaps one day I'll muster up the courage to try the Frog Legs or the maybe the \"Crispy Fried Alligator\".",

I always love walking into a restaurant which looks super duper tiny from the front and then surprises you by being large on the inside.  The colorful pictures and art make it a bright and fun atmosphere.  Just like you'd expect from a 24/7 Mardi Gras party, minus maybe the flashing!  First time's a charm with this place!  Service was fantastic!  The server came up and explained everything to us in terms of drinks, apps and main courses.  Since it was for lunch I went on the light side with the Crawfish and Sherry soup and the Nola salad.    The soup was delicious with just the right amount of kick for me.  Sometimes if things are too spicey for me I become a watery mess, and not in the emotional way!  I think the soup was just creamy amazingness!    The salad was also very fresh with some great toppings such as candied pecans and my personal fav, little mini potato chips.  Of course the later mentioned doesn't end up making a salad healthy, but whatever, it was tasty!  For a final send off we ordered the fried artichoke's as our \"dessert.\"  They were incredible!  Nice, crispy and huge with a spicy mayo type sauce.  I'm all about the sauces, so it was just the right touch.  I really can't wait to try out this place for dinner and/or a happy hour!  I will definitely be back.  I hope they have some idea's for events, because I think the place will be a great host for special parties.  Great addition to Market Square!!",

    "text": "First of all, I'm from New Orleans so I have high standards when it comes to N'Awlins food.  Overall this place was pretty good when it comes to places outside of New Orleans.    The gumbo and crab etouffee were made from a nice roux and were properly flavored which I was impressed by.  I would've liked a bit more meat in it and some French bread on the side though (that is the only proper way to eat gumbo!).  When I asked for some bread I was informed there were 2 choices which were a \"complimentary baguette\" or cornbread for a charge.  I was wondering why we weren't offered this complimentary bread in the first place and by the time we got it we were almost finished our gumbos.  And the bread was cold and not actually French bread.  I long for that flaky airy bread that is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside that is so ubiquitous in New Orleans.   We also had the fried gator appetizer which was tasty though could have used a bit more of a kick to it to spice it up a bit more.   I tasted a friend's jambalaya and another friend's cheesy scallop pasta and both were really good (though the scallop dish was not a typical New Orleans dish).    I had asked about the oyster appetizers which were market price but they were very expensive ($28 for a dozen or $12 for 4, no half dozen options allowed).  I asked the waitress if they were from the gulf, and she disdainfully replied that actually Gulf oysters are small and tasteless so they get theirs from Rhode Island.  Umm seriously? You are trying to celebrate the food of N'Awlins and you just dissed our oysters?  Gulf oysters are delicious and often quite large.  I grew up on them so I was offended by her comments.  And the oysters they served that my friend got were actually super tiny -- tinier than anything I ever get in New Orleans.  And they were not served with the proper accoutrements (Tabasco, horseradish, etc.).    It would have been nice if the PoBoys or Muffaletta sandwhiches could be ordered for dinner but they are only on the lunch menu.  We also had the bread pudding which was very good, and the red velvet ice cream was an unusual touch.    There was a small jazz band playing in the bar area which was a nice touch, especially for a weeknight.  I'd go back and I think they did a decent job for being so far from New Orleans.  But I think there are some basic things they could work on that would make this place even better and more authentic.",

    "text": "I grew up in Louisiana so I was excited to come across a New Orleans themed restaurant. The server even said the restaurant was approved by the City of New Orleans, so I was quite anxious to try out the different dishes that I've been missing. First of all, I have to say that the ambiance is very inviting. When my boyfriend and I went, they had a live jazz band performing.  While the service was excellent, the food itself was subpar. First, we had the fried alligator. It was ok, but I think they should consider serving blackened alligator instead, because alligator can be quite fatty and frying it makes it even oiler. The frog legs were actually great. Super flavorful sauce. My only complaint with that dish is that I wish they gave us some bread to mop up more of the sauce because there wasn't much meat to the frog legs (of course) and there was a lot of yummy sauce left. We got two seafood jambalayas. Strangely, one of the dishes was lukewarm, while the other one was piping hot. The jambalaya tasted ok, but didn't resemble the jambalaya I grew up with. I think the rice was a bit too mushy and there wasn't any spice to it. We also ordered the crawfish tapenade flatbread. This dish was the worst as the flatbread was soft and mushy, and the crawfish and olives didn't go well together. We had to use utensils for this dish because it fell apart in our hands (as flatbread should not). For dessert, I had to try the beignets. The were the worst beignets I've ever had. I think what went wrong is that they fried the dough and then completely caked the beignets in the powdered sugar. If you let that sit around, then the powdered sugar gets mushy and crusted on, instead of lightly sitting on top of the fried dough. If I could recommend a change, I'd say they should try dusting the powdered sugar on, instead of tossing the fried dough in a bowl of powdered sugar. I have to say though that the housemade sorbets that were oddly paired with the beignets were excellent. Last suggestion to the restaurant is that they should hire a chef from New Orleans. I think that would help a lot.   Sorry this post is a bit of a rant about what they should change. I don't want to be too down on the place, but I came in with high expectations, and ended up paying a good amount of money for food that doesn't do New Orleans justice. Next time, I'll just save the money towards a plane ticket to NOLA.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Friday evening with my fiance for dinner.  We had made reservations on open table and arrived a few minutes before our time.  The bar and outside seating was absolutely packed and I thought that this was going to be a problem but we were taken into the dining room which was fairly empty at this point (5:30) and thankfully quiet.  The decor of NOLA is pretty cool as it incorporates many pictures and items that make you think of New Orleans like a picture of Cafe Du Monde, Mardi Gras related art and a picture of a jazz band walking down the street,  My fiance and I decided to start off our evening with the fried green tomatoes.  Whenever they came out I was surprised at the size of the tomatoes as they were not even close to be being thinly sliced like I had imagined.  They were breaded in abita batter and sat on top of a base of creole ranch mustard while being smothered on top with cheddar cheese.  The fried green tomatoes ended up tasting good and I thought the thickness of the tomatoes actually gave a good tomato/batter ratio and brought in enough acidity from the tomato that it paired nicely with the savory cheese.  For my entree I decided to go with the Bourbon Street Pasta.  It was a gemelli pasta that had 8 or so fried oysters around the outside and then tasso ham, peas and piave cheese mixed with the pasta and was topped by a single cooked egg yolk.  Breaking the egg yolk into the pasta gave the pasta a little extra creaminess which I enjoyed.  Overall it was a good dish with the salty fried oysters being my favorite part of it.  The bottom line for me is that I will definitely had back to NOLA again in the future.  I am actually surprised that I hadn't written a review of this before as I have been to NOLA many times and have always been satisfied with the service and food that I received.",

I am from Houston and I have pretty close access to real cajun food... that being said, I ordered a shrimp po boy and was sad to see that it wasn't quite the same. It was so close, but yet so far. Instead of putting just mayo, lettuce, and tomato, they used coleslaw which changed the entire taste of the poboy sandwich! I was not excited about this!  The service was fine, just disappointed as it was definitely not authentic cajun food... so beware if that's what you're expecting!",

I was welcomed by a sociable staff and was seated promptly without a reservation. The patrons were a diverse bunch that ranged from middle-aged couples to teenaged skateboard anarchists, and the ambience was closer to time-honored than cutting edge; if a long-defunct, dimly-lit, and bygone Bourbon Street tavern was plucked from the timestream and into modern, urban Pittsburgh, you'd have an approximate rendition of NOLA. Jazz, conversation, and laughter nudged the air jovially, gently...  Finding it difficult to choose an entree, I was tempted by a threesome of appetizers, and in a fit of lunacy and foodlust, I ordered all of them.  The Crispy Fried Alligator comes to your plate in a bronzed mound of protein morsels artfully littered with chives and accompanied by a smear of spiced aioli. The dislimbed swamp dragon recalled lobster, scallops, catfish, and of course chicken with its meaty, juicy flavor and mouthfeel that was punctuated by the piquant orange cream.   Barbequed Oysters on the half shell came next, and the slithering, slimy, slightly saliferous creatures were eviscerated swiftly by me, tart sauce, buttery cheese and all. The rocky chassis of each mollusk was left to creak in the dusk winds.  House Cured Pork Belly completed the trilogy. Candied and fabulously fatty, the protein portion of the dish was embrocated with a root beer-mustard glaze that wedded saccharine to brackish in eternal, Mephistophelian symbiosis. Fall squash puree, sliced Granny Smith apples, and cornbread arrived with the sour, the citrus, the juice, the crunch, and the grains in tow. Jalapenos were arrested on the spot for obnoxious loitering. How Mardi Gras.   Looking over the dessert menu, I was once again came up against a dilemma, so I crazily doubled-up, tackling both the Red Velvet Ice Cream and the Bayou Chocolate Cake.   Housemade, the scarlet ice cream had a sass that recalled cheesecake and was severely creamy, glacial, bewitching even...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DVoQgDNR0qSw&s=e35f3647f7e74d373301090fb599a8bc3ff04bff9760095edd12a0bd9ebfa5cf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=VoQg...</a>  The cake was nothing less than a devil...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DniCJUBwEdqk&s=69676271e187226237f29df6f6a99b01df33ec3b943b97e99a65e2910d98bd7e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=niCJ...</a>  A brooding, threefold chocolate cake, the sinister slab was desecrated by cocoa nibs, Guinness caramel, and Chicory Pudding, threatening to make me...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dd9erdAiNvik&s=493bbb0bf6b089df6218d7486e104a705d334cf23bcf9cdb5479807c39713b62\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=d9er...</a>  The occult danced with the sweet and briny around a mountain cemetery bonfire as crispy globes of decadent doom floated high above the muddy, funereal soil...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGJvTpiIdK78&s=45f1ec2a64d42af1ef2af29c47e338faa2187ddfe26b79ba9a67f51fab2fe5b3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=GJvT...</a>  Exorcised with a glass of water, I thanked my hospitable waitress for her kindness and adept service, and left feeling renewed...  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DMzQKtADx4tY&s=4e39a4b838e68f9f0cf7cc71917bfce4fcd8a75aaf435110c48b5d80951042ab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=MzQK...</a>  A meeting with comedic firebrand Lewis Black awaited me.

I think it was a flatbread with pesto and tomato. We sat outside listening to the (very loud but good) music and sipping on one of the most amazing fruit-type beers I've ever had. This was in July, so I honestly forget the name of it. I won't forget the taste, though!   The flatbread came out, and I was surprised by the generous size. It was incredibly flavorful and well made. I typically loathe little tomatoes on top of food, but these were perfectly ripe and delicious. I'm getting hungry remembering this meal.   Oh, did I mention my meal was $9, while hers was $27?

    "text": "I let sister Stenquist pick this one out. I gave up perusing Yelp from my Hotel bed and we just stumbled into market square hoping something would be open before 11am on a Saturday. Oddly not a lot opens before 11am in Pittsburgh. And alcohol before 11 and after 9pm seems to be frowned upon. And makes me frown.  But as we sipped our mutual coffees, she decided on this place since it didn't exist when she used to live out here. We were seated super fast and the service was super. Fantastic waitress and not an ounce of complaint. I was just really bummed with how bland and flavorless everything tasted.   We split an order of fried green tomatoes. Which, are huge and have a ton of additional decoration on top that doesn't seem necessary. Sprinkled cheese with greens is weird. Not to mention the batter just didn't seem right. I just like simple, normal sized battered green tomatoes. Frown. But that wasn't where I was even terribly disappointed. The sandwich and soup or salad combos both failed. At least, my sister's sandwich was better. She got a creole pulled pork and I stuck with a creole cordon bleu. It was charred chicken with bacon and swiss cheese. So freaking dry I could scrub the dishes with the chicken. There wasn't any sauce on the pieces of bread either that seemed to have come fresh out of a cooler. Her rice and beans tasted obviously canned. Both of our sides of fries tasted like mesquite wood chips. I ate about 2 or 3 of them and gave up. The best thing I had in all pure honesty was the side salad. Because I would find it incredibly hard to eff up a wedge of iceberg lettuce. I hate to give this a bad review because people seem to enjoy it. But I really like to eat and I ate about only half my food.",

We have also eaten there at least 2 more times within 2 years and it's just terrible and seem to have gotten worst.",

Our server had 4 tables outside and im not sure how many inside she had but she wasn't very helpful, and didn't check in on us very often. We weren't initially given the happy hour menu but a manager brought one to us when we asked. We ordered 4 food items on their happy hour. The brussel sprouts, and catfish fingers were my favorite. I would definitely go back for the catfish. I did not enjoy the pulled pork sliders or mac n cheese as much. The mac n cheese was tasty, but quite salty and it looked like the sauce had split as it was a bit oily. All the food was nice and hot. All in all, it was a pretty good experience. I would like to go back to try some cocktails and listen to some live music!",

I have tried several other dishes on the menu including the flatbreads, seafood jambalaya, shrimp and grits etc...these are all good... but these guys sure know how to make some mean Fried Gators!! This dish is sooo delicious that if you go in for a late dinner (ie after 8:30 pm) its ALWAYS sold out!...i have only gotten to eat it twice of the 8 times I have tried ordering it...Sigh!  The restaurant is conveniently located at market square in downtown and is bubbling with life....especially during the weekends ...it is hard to find a seat even at the bar. They usually have live music on the weekends which adds to the ambiance...  This restaurant is like a piece of New Orleans in the heart of Pittsburgh...Worth a try!!",

My grandmother was in the mood for pizza and we had planned on going to the italian restaurant next door, but we got mixed up and got a table and drinks here. When we realized, the menu looked so good we just stayed put!   We ordered a flatbread pizza and fried green tomato appetizers. Both were really delicious! Nice combination of interesting flavors, cooked well, not overpriced. My only problem with this place were the fruit flies. There were several flying around and one ended up in my water. The restaurant had an open patio which I think contributed to the bugs.",

I had a seafood jambolaya and the others had a crab cake or seafood dinner.  Food was good.  The interior was nicely done, but it got pretty loud as we were leaving.

They have nice artwork on the walls.  I wasn't overly hungry and thought a salad would be best. I ordered the \"Pittsburgh\" salad with chicken topping and ranch dressing. The salad was a decent size and good. Nothing to write home about but at least it was all that I needed.  Little did I realize that within 30 minutes of my arrival this place was packed with people. I had an attentive waitress who brought my food and drink over quickly but then seemed to disappear as I was looking for her to pay my check. I got off my high top chair hoping someone would see me so I could get the check. It paid off after a few minutes. Another waiter came back and explained that my waitress had been transferred to the bar area so he went and got it for me. I was able to pay and then leave.  Nola on the Square sits next to Sienna Mercado in Market Square and on the other side is Nicholas coffee company. Lunch prices are on par for most of your downtown sit down restaurants. It's an average restaurant if you prefer it to grab and go.",

Even the music playing beforehand was good too.   The place was pretty well packed.  We ordered drinks. The rum hurricane was very sweet and bitter at the same time. You'd have a hard time drinking more than one of them.   I ordered the cauliflower soup which was way too salty for me.   For dinner I had the shrimp and grits. The shrimp was cooked just right. Bacon was thick, smokey and delicious. The grits were yummy too. Lots of layers of flavors with the diced veggies and sauce. Best I've had.   Hubs order the Nashville hot chicken sandwich. He really liked it. He also liked the beer selection.  For dessert we shared beignets with iced cream. I thought they'd be warm and soft but were not. The flavor was still good though.   Service was good. The bartender tried to make a less sweet/tart drink for me. I give him a star for trying even though it didn't work out well.   My one real issue is that everything was sticky and I'm not sure why. Our table, the floor, the bathroom. I can't say that it looked dirty. It just felt very sticky.   I would go back for dinner and to hear the band but would skip dessert and drinks (other than beer).",

We waited what seemed to be an eternity for our food.. once it arrived though It was surprisingly good. I do however agree with other reviews when they say that menu items are a little overpriced for what you receive (my cauliflower soup was $6)   My friend got the catfish, which came with yummy sweet potatoes, and I got the shrimp salad.

Or was it just that I ate too much for a lunch? Because this large portion was f*ing amazing. The best shrimp and grits I've had in the Burgh. Finally, the service.

    "text": "A sultry July evening in downtown Pittsburgh and steps from the hotel we stopped into Nolas. We opted for an outdoor table, to absorb the ambience of the square. Choices abounded-chain sub, pizza , or \"taco\" but we decided upon a taste of New Orleans. Inside was air conditioned tin ceilinged comfort, but the patio was beckoning. Nice drink beer and wine lists with happy hour specials til 7. Appetizers too are on special. Nice variety on the main menu and server Ian was helpful and attentive. Overall prices are reasonable, $18/dozen large raw oysters is a deal these days! If you're downtown in Pittsburgh, Nolas is worth a try!",

    "text": "Located right in the middle of Market Square in downtown Pittsburgh, NOLA brings you a nearly authentic Creole/New Orleans style vibe and cuisine. My sister and I had dinner next-door and were lured by the amazing band at NOLA. It was a Jamaican sounding band and the place was packed. There were even people outside listening in because the windows were open. We were able to snag a few seats at the end of the bar to put our stuff down but we danced right away. I finally tried the Ketel One Botanical line mixed with basil and lemon. It was refreshing and I was happy I tried something different, but ultimately I changed a straight away to Ketel and soda water with a lemon, as did my sister. It took a while to put our drink order in because it was so busy, but other than that the service was pretty great. When in Rome, I had to finally try frog legs. Turns out I don't like them very much, I also don't like fried food so I guess it wasn't a great decision, but at least I can say I tried! I also tried oysters but they were very salty for my taste. I also didn't like that they served them with Ritz crackers in the plastic wrap, it cheapened it for me. I'm also from New England so have high oysters & seafood standards. Overall, this place has a very fun vibe and was totally packed on a Saturday. I would return here for the music and the drinks! I would skip the food.",

I just hope that the new owners don't screw everything up....  I've seen that happen where a new owners takes over an existing restaurant and decides to make too many tweaks.  Bleh!  (\"Oh, let's just add turmeric to all of the existing recipes and that will be our \"signature\" touch\")  You get my point.  I just feel bad that they have been so negatively impacted by several fires within the business and I'm sure that has screwed around with their business.  However, if you want some decent New Orlens vittles, Nola on the Square will treat you right.  I have had almost their ENTIRE lunch menu.  (I know, that's ridiculous)  You can't go wrong with any of SOUP, SALAD, & SANDWICH DUOS.  Seriously!  Your tummy will be as tight as a drum after eating one of their po boy sandwiches. (Shrimp, Catfish, Alligator or Roast Beef, you can't wrong, especially served with the Voodoo fries.)!   The lunch entrees are bomb diggity too. Shrimp and Grits, Grilled Catfish and my favorite, Poulet Frites et Salade!   Oh my!(Do you know how hard it is to get a chicken crispy on the outside and moist on the inside?  As someone who cooks, it's not the easiest hat trick to pull off.)  The appetizers (Crispy Fried Alligator, Fried Green Tomatoes) and soups (Red Beans & Rice, Gumbo Ya-Ya and French Onion) are also, right tasty!   I'm trying to stay in town one night for their Grilled Chicken & Dumplings, because I've got a feeling that that dish is going to be off the chain. My sister, Luch, was stationed in New Orleans and they have some AMAZING restaurants.  However, if you can't make it there, go check out Nola on the Square and I think that you will be pleasantly surprised.",

Our server was excellent, very friendly and attentive. They have a pretty big drink menu, I had the \"Cajun Martini\" which was very good.

While the food is pretty darn good (not great), I have to give the place high marks for bringing this style of cooking up north.  Keeping with the style, they have several Abita beers on tap, which are hard enough to find in bottles.  The gumbo is really good, but the portion is small and relatively expensive.  The blackened seasoning has been salty, but when I ask for less salt they do comply.  The waitstaff and bar tenders are very friendly.  Stay away from the banana foster bread pudding dessert, it is so unbelievably good and decadent I'm sure you're selling your soul to the devil.",

This was my first time getting shrimp and grits and I was very satisfied- the grits were nice and creamy, and the shrimp were huge and plump (although I will say that there weren't TOO many of them, just enough to have a bit with each scoop of grits).  The fries were also great, I think they're slightly breaded and then have some cajun seasoning on them- definitely order a side of them if you don't get some with your order.  The price was about right, a little high if anything.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place.",

    "text": "I love NOLA. If it were less expensive I would eat here all the time. Alas, it is on Market Square so the menu prices are high. I've eaten dinner here twice and also came once for brunch. The first time I was here was for a pre-theater dinner. We were seated in the dining room next to the windows into the kitchen so I could watch all the food being prepared. I've read reviews claiming that the jambalaya must be pre-made and frozen. It isn't. I watched a chef make it to order and put it in the brick oven. The second time we were seated in the dining area in the front room near the bar, and the third time I ate at the bar. Thus far I've had grit cakes, shrimp and grits, fried green tomatoes, seafood soup, and beignets. As far as I can tell this is the only place in Pittsburgh that serves beignets. They aren't quite as good as the ones in New Orleans, but they are a pretty good approximation. The food is well prepared and (as the server told us on my first trip there) adapted spice-wise to Pittsburgh, meaning that the Cajun/Creole flavors have been toned down a bit. They will give you hot sauce upon request to spice the food up. As far as drinks go, they have a pretty nice wine list. I had a couple of cocktails when I was there for brunch and I wasn't blown away by them. They seemed a little weak. Also, the service here is hit or miss. They sometimes seem a little disorganized in terms of who is handling which tables. I can live with that though since the food is so good and the atmosphere at the bar is so much fun.",

    "text": "being from both new orleans and cajun country, i go into restaurants outside of louisiana who offer louisiana food with very low expectations.  that being said, my rating for nola is a combination of the atmosphere, service, food and especially abita on tap (which i totally appreciate).    i had the red beans and rice which wasn't bad - it needed more flavor and heat but is made correctly with the bean paste.  i also had the abita battered shrimp which comes with a pepper sauce - not bad but it's better for the heat to be part of the batter rather than the cooked shrimp sprinkled with chili powder.  also, the cole slaw was not good.  finally, we had the griddle grits which was ok.  the flavor was strange at first but it grows on you.  the presentation of all the food was nice, but $11 for a few shrimp and $17 for grits is overpriced.  the service was attentive and good.  the kind of music played was spot on.  finally, one recommendation would be to put hot sauce on the tables, which is standard in louisiana and needed for what was served.",

    "text": "I was so disappointed in this place!  It started at the door!  There was a band playing with music 100% too loud!  the speaker was aimed right back into the restaurant making talking to anyone almost impossible.  When the host made it up to the host stand after us waiting at least 4 minutes I asked for a table outside.  Her response was and I quote \"Did you see any out there?\"  WHAT?!?  I calmly responded with \"I don't know, I didn't look.\"  She went and checked and sadly there were no tables.  We were placed in a two top on the back of the place by the kitchen door.  Our waiter explained one of the specials as \"the crabs sit on berries, they look like you can't eat them, but you can.\"  Now is that something that would like to order?  Our waiter took our drink order and left, then a busboy came up and faced his back to us while holding a plastic sauce container of water and turned his head and asked \"would you like some water?\"  it was like it was a drug deal and he was trying to be shady about it.  It was very weird.  After asking \"what\" three times because the music was so loud I couldn't hear him and the fact that he wasn't facing me, I just gave up and said yes.  He quickly came back with two wine glasses of water on a tray.  While handing placing the one glass down on the table the other tipped and fellow right in the lap of my dining partner.  Now I have been a server as he was at once also, and we understand that these mistakes happen.  However it was very odd that the busboy gave the wet guest a napkin then went right away to cleaning up the carpet.  That was the tipping point and the proof needed that the guest does not matter.  We decided that it was better that we just leave and go somewhere that will respect us and treat us as a guest should be treated.",

    "text": "As good as it gets. EXPENSIVE. yes, great service, atmosphere, and food. It all really ties into the creole, new orleans feel, and its something different for pittsburgh. I read all of there reviews, about the alligator, the grits...etc. So my friend and I ordered the famous alligator, and being a culinary student, I was ambitious to try it. AWESOME, please try it. Our next courses were the Roasted Quail, and the Seafood jambalaya. 25$ a pop, now this may be due to the fact that the waitress asked if we were sharing, but it's still expensive. However no matter the price it was amazing, the jambalaya was smokey, and all about the seafood. Now my favorite was the Quail, just so juicy with the right spices, and the red wine reduction sauce, just my mouth is watering as we speak...and I just left. Now there was no dessert menu, not even listed on the website, and I was dying for a sweet finish, and all I wanted was a banana's foster. So the waitress Abigail instructed us that, they make their desserts day of, and they had a banana's foster bread pudding with a salted caramel ice cream. BOMB DIGGGITTTYY! I'm totally making this myself. A transformation  of the original and it was just the right finish. They also have live entertainment, I'd suggest to make a reservation via open table or what not, but I over heard the hostess talking to another guest that they do get packed when there is live entertainment. Now you would think that it would get so loud in there. No I wasn't screaming out the top of my lungs to my friend, it was so casual, so jazzy, and so a perfect night. BTW hot valet boys and complimentary at that; after 5 on the weekends I believe. Expect an awesome atmosphere, great food plus service. Just expect to spend your pretty pennies on it. All thumbs up!",

    "text": "NOLA is our go-to lunch spot at work. It's pretty great. I have mostly had sandwiches there, so I can't comment on their entrees on the menu. The have solid and interesting food, at a good price. Their fries are can't-help-yourself good. Really. They have one of the best veg sandwiches (Pan Bagnat) I thinkI've ever had. They offer combos of soup+salad or soup+sandwich or salad+sandwich, which is my favorite thing to get. The French onion soup is pretty amazing, salty, cheesy, and with thick chunks of bread under a thick layer of gruyere. Basically the food is great, and I haven't heard anything negative from anyone I've gone there with, with the exception of an off day in the kitchen, that happened maybe once. For a new restaurant, I think they got their chit together pretty quickly, and made some minor changes to the menu after a few weeks, which I think improved the place. I can't speak to their authentic-ness, but they are pretty damn good.   The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is always nice and inviting, with a nice little outdoor area for those beautiful days in the square. They do, however, have one of the worst entrance/lobby/hostess stations in the world. You are basically standing in the middle of the main thoroughfare through the restaurant while waiting to talk to the hostess. And if you happen to have to wait for a table, then you are awkwardly trying to find a place to put yourself with out being in the way. There is basically no where to stand without bothering someone, and that bothers me. It's nice that they have the most amount of seating possible in there, but it would be even nicer if that awkwardness was done away with the removal of one or two tables.",

    "text": "We went to NOLA on a Friday night when we had tickets to a show in the cultural district. I had the crispy alligator bites to start, and the jambalaya for my meal. The aioli on the alligator was excellent - I was eating the crunchy fried bits that came off of the meat just to scoop up the sauce. The jambalaya had an excellent taste. As someone who has been to New Orleans, I can safely say that it tasted _nothing_ like actual New Orleans jambalaya, so if you are looking for authentic creole, you will be disappointed.  The jambalaya was very tomatoey, and not nearly as spicey as I expected. And, there were just 2 pieces each of shrimp and scallop on the top, and none mixed in with the rice. However, although I would not characterize it as authentic, it was still delicious. The blackened chicken and spicy sausage that was mixed in with the rice was really good. I would eat here again, and if I did, I would probably get the jambalaya again (again, the food tasted very good, as long as you don't expect authentic). On a side note, I mentioned to the server that we couldn't linger too long, because we had theatre tickets, and he told us that if we could show him the tickets, we could get a 15% discount. So that was a nice bonus, and if you come before a show, be sure to bring your tickets with you.",

    "text": "I wanted to like this place, I really really REALLY did. After moving from New Orleans we were begging for a place that had food from home. This, however, is nothing like it. Even the atmosphere was oddly wrong? Like they read a book on how one thinks New Orleans restaurants are decorated but not how they actually are. Although, the large painting of the second line is great. We did some research and the artists aren't even from Nola, they commissioned someone local. We were then shocked to discover that NONE OF THE CHEFS HAVE COOKED IN NEW ORLEANS!! And boy, it is evident in the food. Now if you are unfamiliar with creole/cajun style cooking I would guess that you would enjoy this place. If, however, you are used to real dining from New Orleans, this will do nothing but disappoint. Service was slow (hey! they got one thing right! haha), cocktails were subpar, and the food lacked the flavor depth that we are used to. I will say one thing, the boudin was pretty darn good! And while this is just being picky, if you are going to have a restaurant themed such as this, your servers should know how to properly pronounce the food they are serving-there's no 'L' sound in andouille (again, picky but in my opinion, True.) Sadly, we still have not found a place that comes even close to home :(",

    "text": "I've been to Nola on the Square a total of three times now, and (thankfully) every trip was better than the last.  My first trip there was a bit rocky.  Granted, I was there on a Saturday night with a group of about 10.  Plus the restaurant had only been open for a few weeks at that point, so they were probably still working the kinks out at that point.  The packed restaurant definitely took a toll on our service, which was verrrry slow.  And by the time our party arrived, our waiter informed us that they were completely out of pasta, which resulted in almost half the table having to re-examine the menu for another option, including myself.  I understand that this happens, but it still looked pretty bad to be out of pasta by 8pm on a Saturday night in a relatively new restaurant.  I ended up ordering the special dish of the night, which was steak with some form of potatoes and spinach.  All very good, but nothing to write home about.  My second visit found myself and my parents there late on a Sunday afternoon.  We walked in to find the restaurant relatively empty of both patrons.....and staff.  There were three hostesses working, and after receiving a poorly-disguised eye roll from one after I told her we didn't have reservations, they all informed us that the ENTIRE wait staff was currently in a meeting, so no one was available yet to take our order.  We then proceeded to wait 20 minutes for the wait staff meeting to adjourn before we could even order a glass of water.  But I put my annoyance at that situation on the hostessses, not the waiters.  It wasn't the waiters fault they were ALL pulled into a meeting simultaneously, and apparently it wasn't in the hostess' job description to ask paying patrons if they wanted something to drink while we waited.  But ANYWAY.  Once our waitress arrived (she was quite lovely), she promptly brought our drinks and took our order.  Our food arrived in a timely manner and was very good.  I had the smoked pork chop which was massive and cooked and seasoned very well.  So despite the horribly rocky start, our meal ended quite nicely.  So FINALLY, upon my third visit, I had a completely positive Nola experience.  My group was promptly seated and our server was very informative and attentive the entire time.  I ordered the Scallps Mac Daddy which was soooooo yummy.  It's hard to go wrong with any combination of mac and cheese plus seafood, so this dish was absolutely delicious.  I can't wait to go back for my fourth visit and get it again!  So, after working some glitches out of its system, Nola finally seems to be working like the well-oiled machine it was always meant to be!",

We had a 7PM reservation made weeks ago, and were seated immediately upon arrival. We selected the fried alligator and red beans and rice as our starters. The alligator was PHENOMENAL(best I've ever had) and the red beans and rice was spot on! I had the shrimp and grits, while my fiance chose the shrimp and scallops mac daddy. Both were excellent. We settled on the apple/caramel bread pudding for dessert. It was great, as well as the homemade vanilla ice cream that accompanied it. My fiance had the sangria, and enjoyed it. It was a little too rosy for my liking, but it satisfied her palate. Our waiter, Sean, was sufficiently attentive, and the manager, Mark, made his rounds to ensure that each guest had a pleasurable experience. I love the open kitchen setup, which affords you the opportunity to witness the painstaking approach and dedication that is shown to each plate. We often joke about how Yinzers (generally speaking) don't know good food when they taste it, and often make horrible reviews on good, if not great, restaurants on here. We look forward to coming back to try brunch and po-boys at lunch! Also worth noting, parking is a premium around the square... That being said, if you make one pass with no spots available, there are a couple of parking garages that are a short walking distance from NOLA.",

We had a wonderful waiter who did an excellent job seeing that we had just what we wanted.  We couldn't decide what to order and so we told our waiter we wanted three separate entrees and that we wanted to share.  He suggested that he bring out the appetizer first and then the entrees in succession one after another.  We ordered the Crispy Fried Alligator as an appetizer and it was delicious and perfectly seasoned.  The first entree we received was the Shrimp and Grits and it was really delicious.  Two of the people in my group (myself included) have lived in the southern low country and are shrimp and grits snobs and this definitely lived up to expectations!  The second entree was definitely the favorite of the bunch.  We ordered the catfish and it was absolutely delicious.  Our final entree was the jumbalaya and it was highly recommended by our waiter.  It was heated in the wood stove so there was a charred flavor to the stew that I really enjoyed but two other members of our group found off-putting.  The waiter encouraged us to eat dessert but we were simply too full!  Next time, we will definitely give it a try!  We will definitely visit Nola again!  It was an all around wonderful experience!",

Our server Kelli, was great, she was patient and attentive.  I ordered the mushroom panini and voodoo fries.  I also ordered the gumbo appetizer as a starter.   The gumbo arrived a short time later, and it was ok, but the base tasted just a little bit burnt.  It was good, but had a bitter aftertaste.  The panini sandwich was a bit of a disappointment.  The multi-grain bread would have been better had it been toasted correctly.  The bread had been buttered and not left on the grill long enough to toast properly, which left the bread greasy and soggy.   Also the portabello mushroom was much smaller than the bread slices, so there was LOTS of bread and very little mushroom.   I'll definitely return to NOLA, but would definitely order a different item.",

We had the seafood jambalaya which wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be. It had a very... interesting flavor (for lack of a better word). I'm not an expert at jambalaya but it didn't taste like what I remember. It had a bit of a sour taste to it which I decided I didn't like because it reminded me of food that was spoiling.   We also had the Gumbo Ya-ya, and Creole Pulled Pork Po Boy. The gumbo was pretty good. As for the Creole Pulled Pork Po Boy, the pork  was pretty bland but it tasted good when eaten with the gumbo. It was served on fresh bread.   The restaurant itself was pretty loud. Our waitress was really friendly and nice and the bathrooms were clean which is always a  bonus. Overall, I only gave NOLA a 3 star because I really did NOT like the way the jambalaya tasted. I had higher expectations for the restaurant.",

    "text": "Talk about world problems. It's tough to write a negative review for a restaurant experience during which you actually enjoyed your meal. HOWEVER, after three times trying NOLA it's time for an official 2-star review.  In my past experience here, the service has been very slow.  Fine, really - as long as you have the time to spare.  Yesterday's visit was no exception.    Our party of 6 arrived to a mostly-empty restaurant between 12:30 and 12:45 for NOLA's brunch.  Three members of our group ordered the special of the day: Banana Bread French Toast.  Sounds amazing, right?!  Well, it was, but I'll get to that.  The food took a while to get to our table and when it did, it was mostly...wrong.  The three who had ordered the special were served the regular French toast instead; which was a big departure from the advertised special.  The server was very apologetic and explained that due to a glitch in the system, the regular French toast was ordered instead of the special, but that the situation would be remedied.  And each of them did finally receive the amazing banana bread French toast eventually; but not after eating pretty much all of the original French toast since the replacement order was slow to arrive.  In the meantime, another friend leaned in and, very innocently asked, \"Is Eggs Benedict supposed to be cold?\"  Alas friend, it is not supposed to be cold.  She sheepishly mentioned this to our server, who really was quite upset at the entire spectacle on our behalf, and he took it to the kitchen immediately.  What returned a few minutes later was Eggs Benedict.  Her previous order of Eggs Benedict, to be exact.  The same bit was taken out of the one muffin and the previously beautifully poached eggs, were now a yellow mess of luke-warm goo on top of each muffin.    The good news is, the company was stellar and we mostly laughed through the entire visit.  We also felt bad for our server and knew full-well that most of this was likely not his fault.  He mentioned that he would be speaking to the manager since the situation was \"unacceptable.\"  The manager did stop by our table to ask how everything was going.  We mentioned that there were a few \"glitches\" and left it at that.  He asked if the only issues of the day were with the French toast.  We explained that another dish arrived cold and appeared to have just been reheated in the microwave, to wish he replied \"we don't own a microwave.\" Meooow.  No one pursued the issue and all of us were given 50% off our respective bills - even those two of us (myself included) who were served their food without issue (Shrimp Clemenceu and another who ordered Fried Chicken & Waffles).  Soooo, NOLA. What do to? The food is pretty good. The service is pretty slow. And, up until the aforementioned manager paid us an odd visit, I might've given it another go.  But that was just...well...weird.",

We started with the frog legs and fried alligator. I preferred the gator to the frog legs.  I had the shrimp and grits, which was a massive portion. It was good, not as spicy as I expected and slightly on the greasy side, but I ate around the puddles. We also had the steak frittes, seafood jambalaya, red fish and the cat fish. No complaints from the peanut gallery regarding their meals.   I'm anxious to go back and try something new!",

    "text": "WOW. I was seriously so impressed with NOLA. My friend and I decided to go here for dinner on a Thursday night on a whim. I'd heard pretty good things about the place so I was excited to give it a try. We were seated quickly (the place is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside) and our server came right over. They were fairly busy but not packed. I was feeling somewhat confused by the menu because I am NOT familiar with Creole food at all, so I was very happy when our server asked if we've been there before and helped us a lot with the menu when we told her we hadn't.  She was extremely familiar with the menu, and even things that weren't actually on the menu but could be done by customizing a dish. She recommended the jambalaya and the scallops mac daddy, which is a scallop mac and cheese dish. My friend got the jambalaya and I got the scallops, and we opted for a flatbread pizza as an appetizer. We were so happy with our choices. Everything was absolutely excellent. And I can't stress enough how great the service was.  The manager came over and asked how our meals were and about our experience in general, which was nice of her and we told her how pleased we were.  As a disclaimer, yes it is a little pricey but in my opinion the food and the service is well worth it. And it's in a great location in Market Square. We will certainly be back!!",

    "text": "Stopped in late Friday night for dinner with my girlfriend. We split appetizers of fried alligator and fried green tomatoes.   The alligator was good, tender and crisp. Think popcorn chicken...errrr alligator. It was plated with a  remoulade dipping sauce.   The fried green tomato were sliced about a half inch thick, battered and fried. They were plated with sprinklings of cheddar cheese, micro greens and a creole mustard ranch sauce drizzled on top. Normally I am anti-ranch, it has a strong flavor that overpowers most things (think cool ranch doritos....bleh). This was not the case here, the dish was great! Would definitely order again.  We split an order of seafood jambalaya for our entree. They thoughtfully split our dish between two individual skillets which were lined with rice topped with a spicy red sauce, a scallop, 2 shrimp, grilled chicken, and slices of sausage. I wish the sausage was crispier/rendered out more but the seafood and chicken were all prepared great.  My girlfriend had the classic New Orleans drink, the Hurricane and I had a boring plain old Yuengling draft. Would definitely return to try some other menu items.",

    "text": "I have visited NOLA on two different occasions.   The first was a very casual afternoon when we had been out and about exploring downtown Pittsburgh. We sat outside (a great location for people watching in the square, by the way) and enjoyed a couple of drinks and a sampling of appetizers. Everything we had was wonderful - including the service!  Our second visit was on Easter Sunday. We had a party of 5 and were assigned to a table in the back part of the restaurant that was being overseen by William (I'll get back to him later).   First off, I will say that this restaurant has 3 unique seating areas to choose from based upon your mood. As I mentioned earlier, the outdoor seating area had a very nice cafe feel with a great view of Market Square. Then there is the bar section, where various televisions were broadcasting sports programs while jazz music played in the background. It had a very fun, New Orleans feel to it. This particular location seemed to be a pretty happening area for people in their 20s & 30s given the loud music and sporting event coverage. The place that we were seated was located in the back of the restaurant. It was quieter and had much more of an upscale feeling than the front two sections. This was perfect for us as we had just come from a theater production and were anxious to discuss the details of the play. The kitchen, which is located in this area, was open and visible to us, although we were not bothered at all by the noise level. They workers seemed to be very conscientious of keeping it that way. The food was fabulous and so was the service - which brings me back to William.   William, our waiter, was AMAZING! Not only was he extremely familiar with the menu and the available specials, but he made sure that each one of us had his individualized attention as we were ordering. Each of us had different tastes which he personally evaluated before offering suggestions of those dishes he thought matched those qualifications. We all loved the selections we had made thanks to his input. Also, many times waiters and waitresses can tend to be over attentive, in that they strive to make sure that their customers' every need is met. This, however, can become a bit complicated when you have a group involved in deep discussion. It took a lot of though and insight on his part to know what times were best for him to step in and which times were better for him to quietly remain available in the background. Somehow, William managed to juggle this task in the most efficient and least-intrusive way possible. Although he never interrupted a conversation or thought, he made sure that he took care of all of our needs including drink refills and plate clearing with almost no notice of his presence.   I would highly recommend this restaurant. Service and food are fabulous...and make sure to request William if you want superior service. Way to go, William!",

I had the jumbalaya, the NOLA salad with scallops added, blue crab etouffee, & bananas foster mousse. Everything was great. My favorite was the etouffee. The jumbalaya was baked in a iron skillet and any sauce that should have been in there when served was baked out. I like it with some sauce running around. Therefore, I picked out the meat and left most of the rice. But the shrimp and especially the scallops were awesome.",

We were surprised when he gave us a \"tour\" of the restaurant showing us the rooms in the back for large groups.  We must look like party organizing people.  We are not.  We were seated near the open kitchen.    Being a huge fan of red beans and rice, we decided to share a bowl.  Their version is totally unlike any I have ever eaten.  It was incredibly thick and tomato based with a lot of ham shank.  We liked it anyway.  For my meal, I ordered the half salad/half sandwich.  I got the NOLA salad with candied pecans, red onion, tomato and sweet potato chips with yummy vinaigrette.  For my sandwich, I picked the Croque Monsieur.  It was stuffed with tender, thick carved slices of smoked ham, grilled rustic bread, my favorite Gruyere cheese with apple butter and dijon.  Even though this was 1/2 sandwich, it was more than I could eat!!  BJ got the Seafood Jambalaya.  He really liked it.  Of course, we didn't have room for dessert.   Enjoyed the atmosphere, food was great, service was passable.  We can't wait to eat here again!",

    "text": "Working downtown, you're always looking for new and good lunch spots. It's nice to see classy joints like this popping up all over the downtown area. Especially in the newly renovated Market Square. When they first started renovating the area, I just had this \"what's the point\" feeling. Market Square was a haven for the homeless and unemployed. Driving property value down, and detracting your average downtown commuter.  I'm happy to say I was sorely mistaken. The face-lift Market Square has gotten has made me look at downtown Pittsburgh in a whole new light. A nice open airy atmosphere with plenty of trendy eateries all around. Sure you can't drive out all of the \"riff-raff,\" but they certainly tried.  A co-worker and I stopped by NoLa to check it out a couple weeks ago. I thought the decor was cool, an over-the-top (in a good way) vision of Bourbon St and Mardi Gras. We both got the Chicken and Andouille Po Boy, which was tasty.  We found the homemade mustard was a bit overpowering though, as it was not evenly distributed and sort of gobbed onto the sandwich.  The service was good. In fact, it was too good. My co-worker and I were approached, no joke, six times by four different people asking how our meal was and how everything was going. This was excessive, and borderline annoying, given that we weren't even there an hour.  Overall I think this place is pretty good, and has the potential to be better. I feel like they are still trying to work out some of the kinks, and once they do, things will definitely approve.  If you love somewhat-pricey cajun food, and are downtown, this place is right up your alley.",

    "text": "I enjoy the city of Pittsburgh. And I enjoy trying new things.   So suffice it to say, I was happy to combine those two things this when my wife and I and two friends were hanging out in Market Square and PPG Place the Saturday of Light-Up Weekend. One of them suggested Nola, as she had eaten there once before. Since we hadn't, we went along.   I've been to New Orleans, and the first thing I noticed walking in: the place smelled a lot like that city. That was a good thing. Also a good thing: our timing. We were told that normally on a Saturday night, there would be a lengthy wait for a table, but since we had beaten the dinner rush, we only waited about ten minutes.   Once we were seated, a lovely lady named Mariah was our server. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and even when she wasn't sure about what that day's specials were, she let us know that she'd get us that information: which she did - and I was glad, as I wound up ordering the fried chicken, which was different from any I had ever had before and very good. It had a sweetness to it and a bit of a kick - much like the aioli that came with crispy fried alligator, which, along with the frog legs we ordered and the fried green tomatoes made for great appetizers (and I don't even like tomatoes).   I didn't try the flatbread, but it got rave reviews from my friends and my wife, who did. At the end of the evening, a manager came up and asked us how we liked the fried chicken, as they were experimenting with it and wanted a customer's opinion. At that point, I hadn't tried it, but my wife had and she assured him that it was very good (something I'd find out later).   For drinks, we kept it pretty simple, though my wife did enjoy the Canyon Oaks Cabernet.   We didn't wind up getting dessert, because we were very full. Too bad, because I imagine that they make a great beignet.   All in all, it was a very good dining experience. Can't wait to come back.",

I think New Orleans has the most amazing food scene, and I was so excited that I might get to have some of that food-joy here in Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, we just weren't very impressed.  My husband and father-in-law had the chicken and waffles. It's soooo much chicken--like a huge portion--although it was not specially seasoned which we kinda expected it to be. It was just really good fried chicken. The waffle was good, but not incredible.  My mom had the shrimp dish; I had the crab and asparagus omelet. We both liked our food, but again, we weren't blown away. My daughter liked the french toast although it was a little dry. It comes with a marmalade and a little light sauce, but maybe it needed something a little more liquid-y?  The highlight of my meal was the grits. The GRITS are GREAT although in my opinion, Carmi still has the best grits in town.  I tried one voodoo fry (not gluten-free), and it was good. I'd have more if I could, but I wouldn't go back just to have them.  The service was uneven. The assistant manager greeted us and brought us to our table. She was very nice. Our server was nice, but sometimes it was difficult to get his attention and he kept forgetting things, and as soon as he got another table, he disappeared. I don't think he was a bad waiter, but he wasn't very quick.  Bottom line: Not bad, just not great.",

Three of us walked through downtown on a gorgeous sunny day, through the hip and happenin' farmers' market, past the live music in Market Square and through the wide-open doors of NOLA to quite a crowd.  And no wonder....what fantastic food!  I've had shrimp n grits all over the south...NOLA's was one of the best I've ever experienced....and most certainly the best in Pittsburgh.  Cheesy, Anson Mills stone ground grits, at least 8 or 9 great big ol' sweet, perfectly cooked shrimp, smoky bacon, the classic trinity of celery, bell peppers and onion all played together for a sweet, sweet song of the South in my mouth.    My dining companions both had the NOLA salad.  One had the croque monsieur, the other had the muffaletta.  Both were very, very happy.    Curtis, our server, was friendly and efficient; Ann, one of the managers, stopped at our table to make us feel right at home.  Heck, she even walked me over to the Chef's Table and told me about the special dinners they hold there.  Nice.  Our table was at the back of the restaurant right by the \"pass.\"  The line moved together in harmony to pump out fine food with exquisite attention to detail.  Serving plates were wiped clean of any stray drips before being whisked away to the lucky recipients.    Welcome, NOLA!  Make yourself at home and stay a while....a long, long while.",

Our waitress Cassandra was phenomenal in her menu expertise. Our party included a small child and our waitress was very accommodating to her needs putting a rush on her food and bringing her crackers while we waited. The Drink menu has a great selection of craft beers and speciality drink. The menu is traditional New Orleans  . I highly recommend the frog leg appetizer it was exquisite. I have ate them from many establishments and these were by far the best! I truly enjoyed my experience and felt like I was in the French Quarters!",

We saw one female manager  who either sat at a table watching tv or was yelling at the servers who all seemed like they had no idea what they were doing. It was very uncomfortable. Also who doesn't have luxadaro or amarena for an old fashioned?! Very disappointed about the drinks and the price we paid for them",

The first time we were there during happy hour and we got the pork belly and the flat bread - both were amazing. The cocktails were very good as well - I had something with jalapenos in it and it was flavorful but very spicy as well.  We ended up going back the next morning to try the beignets - they weren't as good as Cafe Du Monde but they were still worth getting.   I would definitely go back next time I am in Pittsburgh, sounds like the live music would be exciting.",

    "text": "I've been here twice within 1 week and it has instantly become one of my top 5 favorite restaurants to visit. I'll break down my joy below..  Food: Great! I've been to New Orleans, so I wasn't shocked by some of the offerings since they do seem to try to keep to traditional NOLA foods. The only thing (which they do mention) is that the spiciness is adapated for the Northern palate, so it's not as cajun as you might expect. The best? The red velvet bread pudding changed my world --- seriously, just try it out.  Atmosphere: I love the look, feel, and vibe of this place. It's inviting, jovial, and a lot bigger than you'd expect. I was shocked by how large the inside was. They also play live music in the bar most nights. The only issue was that the one band was incredibly loud and my second visit was near the front of the joint. They allowed the band to continue playing loud and we could barely hear eachother. We even told them about it, and the waiters seemed to agree, but nothing was done. While I appreciated the music, it's still a restaurant and not a club.  Service: Great! Both times it seemed that the waiters enjoyed working there and were nothing but nice.   Price: They are a little expensive. You can get by with a cheaper tab if you stick to their flat breads (starting at $9) and desserts, but you'll definitely end up paying at minimum $15 (most above 20) a plate when you're considering entrees.",

I've gotten food lunch that I just love and crave and then the next time I come it's terrible.   My \"new\" biggest beef with this place is that on one visit the server helped himself by upping my tip.  I pay with a credit card and I always tip 20%, I round up for good service and may round down for poor service but never less than 15%.   I had gotten the lunch combo which is around $12, so with tax and tip the total was $16.  My credit card statement showed over $22.   I brought it in the next time I went to eat there to discuss with the manager and he didn't apologize at all and said he couldn't refund me the difference but today's meal would be free.  Which was a little bit more than what I was owed.  The fact that he never said that he was sorry it happened just really irked me.   The fact that the food quality is so inconsistent and that someone on the wait staff stole from me means I will never go back.",

    "text": "Why did I wait so long?  NOLA had been on my radar for sometime but, I just never made it there. Then they had a severe fire in 2014 and was closed for remodeling so when my team chose NOLA for our annual Holiday Luncheon and being that I had never been I was pretty excited.   Once we walked in we were teleported straight to Bourbon Street. I have been to New Orleans and this space has the soul and feel of N'awlins.  Not long after we were seated David K. our server greeted us and took our drink orders. There were six in our party so we decided to start off with some appetizers to share. We ordered the Red Beans & Rice, Fried Green Tomatoes (Abita Amber Ale Batter, Cheddar, Creole Mustard Ranch), Salmon Cake (Basil aioli, pickled red onions, cauliflower and Arugula hash) and Stuffed Mirliton (Chayote squash, catfish cake, trinity, dill bechamel). The red beans & rice and fried green tomatoes were the favorites of the group. The red beans & rice had some spice to them and just enough heat. The fried green tomatoes were delicious as well.  For our lunch entrees my team ordered the Seafood Jambalaya (Cajun Rice, Chicken, Shrimp, Sea Scallops, Andouille), Fish Du Jour and the Cajun Grilled Catfish (fire-roasted sweet peppers and onions, mashed Yukon potato, sauteed spinach, spicy lemongrass-citrus Beurre Noisette). I chose the Gumbo Ya-Ya. It featured chicken, Andouille, okra, File, and steamed rice and I also chose the Shrimp and Grits. It featured shrimp, Trinity, Abita Amber Ale, Anson Mills cheddar grits and smoked bacon) My God! They were both so good!  Everyone raved about their food and said we had to come back! Very rarely does everyone all like their food as we have some picky eaters on our team.  After lunch a few of us went over to the bar for cocktails. I had the 504 Old Fashioned. It has Makers Mark, Peach Schnapps, Peach Bitters and a orange slice. It is strong with a hint of peach. It was quite delicious.  NOLA on the Square has great Creole food and excellent service. I highly recommend them!  Insider Tip: Come for lunch instead of dinner as the entree prices are about half that of the dinner prices.",

Their menu gives you the option to choose between two of the following: half sandwich, salad, or soup. You get the best of both worlds. Why choose just one when you can have both?! My absolute favorite is the Nola salad with the Nola club. It's served with voodoo fries which are probably some of the best fries out there.

I'm used to Cafe du Monde where the beignets are pretty big. But these stood up in taste. The coffee was a little weak.  - Chicory coffee: iced chicory coffee? Wtf?

Because its a New Orlean's style restaurant, it goes without saying there will be creole, jumbalaya and catfish.  What most people are worried about before eating here is whether there is food here that does not fit those categories or isn't spicy and the answer is yes.    First off, the fries are great - perfectly crispy, salty, peppery and maybe some creole in there for a side that no one will deny is fantastic.  The NOLA club is a nice twist on the club sandwich, turkey on ciabatta, with spicy aeoli, some crisp bacon, pickled tomatoes and little bit of avacado: A safe move done in a way that makes it exciting. The steak salad is also a good move for those with tenuous affinities for spice but with little flairs to make it unique.  Each dish here is tastefully created and consistently delivered.  The atmosphere is nice and is intended to make one dream of Mardi Gras but patron's won't forget that Pittsburgh is right outside. The service is friendly but nothing to write home about.  Overall the food is a 5 but with the service and slightly-above-generic atmosphere, the place gets a solid 4 in my books.",

My wife and I are suckers for good oysters, and they know how to pick me. I'm particularly fond of their gumbo and PO boy sandwiches. You can get a nice side salad for lunch with your meal as well.  Regarding brunch I've had the beignets which are wonderful and the pancake special is always good from my experience. To top it off their coffee is delicious.  For my money, one of the best sit down options in Market Square, or downtown for that matter.",

The fried alligator the first time was actual pieces of alligator- about the size of chicken nuggets.  We remembered how good it was that we ordered it again this time.  What a disappointment.  The waitress set the rectangular plate down on our table and my husband and I looked at each other and said what the hell is that? It looked like a pile of granola on one end.  The pieces were literal crumbles.. you couldn't even poke a fork in one.  Or taste any meat.  It was all breading.  For our entree we both ordered the sea food pot pie.. it was ok... super salty... more veggies and diced potatoes than seafood.  Silver lining, my glass of Reisling was superb.",

They have $4 grapefruit mules! I don't know if this changes ever, but it was delicious, and you rarely find mules on happy hour menus, so this was a plus (also deciding factor)! They have a happy hour menu with select apps and drinks and everything is $4 with 1/2 off flatbreads as well ($5-$6). Pro tip - sit inside because they don't do happy hour outside. I also ordered the Cajun Aricini, having no idea what to expect, but they were so good! The crust was a little salty, but they were basically fried balls of rice and Cajun sausage and they're huge! I will definitely have to revisit NOLA!",

    "text": "I used to pass by this place all the time when I lived downtown years ago. Having been to New Orleans, my curiosity got the best of me and I went here with two other people for lunch.  So, what's the deal...  Imagine you've never been to New Orleans but you want to open a restaurant that serves Creole, Cajun, and southern food in general and you want to do it right here in Pittsburgh - where we are known for putting french fries on salad (and on everything else) and coming up with \"innovative\" ways of ripping off interesting cuisine, namely from other cultures (looking at you DeShantz, Kucenic). Okay, now imagine you hire people who have no idea how to cook this food but function only in being belligerent.  Okay, so maybe that doesn't sum it all up for you so let me paint you a picture:  Nobody from New Orleans would ever go to this place - that much I know. So who is this place for? Think some yinzer from South Hills. Brentwood specifically. Born and raised but he tells everyone he's from Pittsburgh. This guy has never been anywhere else, ever, and he prefers it that way. Downtown is scary still but at least they got rid of all the homeless people in Market Square, he hopes. He's a simple man and enjoys few things but one of those things is Pittsburgh. The other thing he loves is some real authentic fancy food and what better place to find that then right here, dahntahn. This guy's idea of good eating is sweet sauce style spaghetti and meatballs, just like grandma Cercones used to make so imagine the ego-boner this dude gets when he rolls up to NOLA and sees some gator on the menu - here in Pittsburgh! And it's fresh, you know, what with our close access to swamps. 5 stars! And he's gonna tell all his buddies at the moose lodge too!",

Fried green tomatoes sprinkled with shredded white cheddar and drizzled in a hearty ranch mayo. The grilled chicken and dumplings---scrumptious! Ricotta dumplings with peas, wild mushrooms and carrots in a flavorful sauce. Chicken is grilled with fragrant spices that bring Bourbon Street to mind.

My friend had a couple glasses of wine and I was in the mood for beer, so I tried hop gator by Abita Ales. Being the beer nerd that I am, I noticed that a lot of their featured \"seasonals\" were not very seasonal at all- at least three of them had release dates in early spring . BUT hop gator was quite good. Smooth and it was served in a fancy little beer glass.   We weren't planning on eating but one of the bartenders gave us a menu and I couldn't help but look. I saw fried green tomatoes and had to order them. I also ordered the New Orleans style BBQ shrimp because I was curious how their seafood was- being a New Orleans themed restaurant and all.   Yum. The shrimp was amazing! Perfectly cooked and seasoned! The sauce was amazing! The fried green tomatoes were good as well but not the best that I had. Wouldn't order them again. The shrimp alone is why I will come back and try some more New Orleans goodies!",

    "text": "I will try to make this short and to the point.   I was in town for business and decided to give this place a try...   First and foremost, the food was decent, but nothing special. It's a little overpriced, but it's downtown Pittsburgh so that's to be expected.   What I didn't expect was the  unprofessional and bizarre service I received.   The restaurant has a mature business atmosphere, but the two young males I dealt with in particular, were not suited for this environment.   Normally, when I attend a restaurant of this caliber, the staff knows how to articulate and address their guess with respect.   These two individuals, the host (who came to my table often) and my waiter, kept talking to me in a manner as if I were one their PlayStation or Xbox buddies.   For example, these two individuals would say things like:   \"Man, you want something to drink, dude?\"  \"Umm... You ready to order yet, man?\"  \"Umm... You need anything else, dude?\"  \"Man, you want a bag or something, man?   It wasn't anything overly egregious, but I kept scratching my head, because it was just weird and unprofessional.   Here I am, a paying customer, in business attire, in a business atmosphere and I'm being addressed with little to no respect.   At one point, I thought maybe this was part of the theme of the restaurant, but I doubt it.   For the record...   I'm sure a few people will read this and will automatically assume that these two young men were African American or minorities...   That would be inaccurate.   These two young men, we're both Caucasian males from Pittsburgh....  Be that as it may, although I received mediocre service at best, I still managed to give my waiter a generous tip based on the required gratuity percentage of my overall bill.   Again, the food was decent, but I don't expect to spend any more of my hard earned money at this establishment. I don't see myself returning.",

    "text": "I was really excited to come upon New Orleans cuisine in Pittsburgh, but I should have known: good Creole cuisine is hard to find outside of the Big Easy. Having been to New Orleans, I had an idea of what the food should taste like, and was sorely disappointed. I came around brunch and was really excited to see beignets with a chicory coffee dip as an option. That was an obvious choice. But as a main, at the recommendation of one of the waiters (not the one that was helping me), I decided on the shrimp and grits (was thrilled to see they use Anson Mill grits!) The shrimp and grits came first, smelled amazing... and that's where the excitement stopped. It was four small pieces of shrimp, swimming in a pool of spiced salt, with a small cake of grits hidden underneath. The salt content was unbelievable. It's been a long time since I've eaten ANYTHING that salty. And when I mentioned it to the waiter who had suggested it, all he had to say was \"Oh, that's why I like it\". Great. I didn't even finish it. Suddenly I was really looking forward to the beignets. But the first course should have been an indicator of the quality I was going to get. The beignets were soggy, with the icing sugar just soaking into the dough... not hot and fluffy, like they do in New Orleans. This was a very poor imitation.  The icing on the entire meal, though, had to be my very unenthusiastic waiter, who clearly would have rather been anywhere else but there. Aside from introducing himself, very little was said and not once did I see even a hint of a smile. After receiving my food, he disappeared for a long while, I even had to go inside (I had been sitting outside) so I could ask for my bill because I didn't know where he'd been. All in all, a very disappointing experience from start to finish.",

I really liked my smoked turkey Cuban (a little heavy on the meat), and the voodoo fries are good. My companions would recommend NOLA's jambalaya as well.

The waiter kept giving us things that we didn't order - 2 dishes and a drink.  He left the things at the table and said I won't charge you for this, at which point we shared them or asked to have them packed up.  At the end, all of these mistakes showed up on the bill, inflating it by around $30.  He refunded one of the three items.  If they want to charge prices like they do, the service and customer satisfaction should be better.    There were also a lot of other little mistakes.  A better server could have made this 4 stars.  Also, if I didn't dissuade you from going, try the Bagnettes (awesome powdered doughnuts.)  A very nice desert to share with 2 or 4.",

I have turned into a creature of habit with this place, and usually end up with ordering the lunch salad, sandwich, and fries combo with the Nola salad and the southern chicken cordon bleu sandwich. These items are always dependable, and the fries are delicious and crunchy. I love goat cheese on salads, and there are even a few chips on top for added crunch. The sandwich is a very generous portion, even though it is only half of a sandwich.  The drinks look yummy, although I have only ordered beer on tap. The beer on tap list is decent, although I would enjoy more regional selections since the food is all about bringing New Orleans to Pittsburgh.  I love sitting outside when the weather is nice. It's easy to get a last minute open table reservation for lunch, and that way you accumulate open table points while avoiding waiting for a table. When it's too cold to sit outside, there is ample room in the dining room. There are multiple rooms, and lots of room at the bar as well.",

I remember seeing Aligator and Frog legs on there. I believe my lack of interest is because I  never tasted them before as well as my perception of what that may have been.

    "text": "Well I am finally back. I have had a busy few months so I have been absent in my reviews and I am looking forward to getting back into it. NOLA seems to me to be a good place to start.  NOLA on Market Square is a great spot to get great Creole, Cajun, and Louisiana inspired cuisine. This type of food is some of my favorite on the planet. Here's an idea: let's take traditional French techniques and dishes, and throw them in a blender with Spanish, African, and American ingredients and methods. That is the basis of Creole cooking and a winning recipe if you ask me. NOLA does it better than anyone I have seen in a long time. I went there with some friends one evening for dinner and drinks. When we got there we were ushered to the back to a table by the kitchen. I was thankful for this for a few reasons. 1) we were out of the front of the restaurant that was being occupied by live music which, while very good Louisiana Jazz, was way too loud for my tastes and 2) we got to see the controlled chaos of a top notch kitchen.  NOLA is decorated with the standard Mardis Gras colors of green, yellow, and purple.The bar is long and has all the bottles lining a backlit mirror. I really dig it. It is warm, intimate, and welcoming (so long as the band isn't rocking too hard).  Service mirrored the the decor. Our server was nice, informative, and followed all the proper steps of perfect service. She seemed to be busy with a full section, yet we were never forced to wait an unreasonable amount of time for our drinks or food. Overall I found the service friendly, competent and all that I could ask for.  As far as the bar is concerned one is in for a treat. NOLA has a decent beer selection with all kinds of Abita products. Hopheads can be content with a Jockomo IPA or a a Purple Haze for the fruit-inclined. Also the cocktail list is rather impressive with all of my selections being delicious, if a little pricey.  For me however, the food is always the main event. For an appetizer I suggest the pork belly (a recurring favorite if you read my reviews). You could also try the alligator bites but they taste just like chicken. Kinda bland. For a main course my go-to is the shrimp and grits. The grits are smooth and creamy with soft fluffy shrimp tossed in all topped with scallions and andouille sausage for heat. Those who possess a spice aversion should try the steak frites. I put it up against Ruth's Chris for quality and taste.   All in all NOLA is a great place. You will pay good money to go but it is definitely worth it in my book.",

I didn't care for this dish. The NOLA salad (dinner size, $5) was good, however. My favorite dish was the crawfish tapenade, which is much like a personal-sized pizza. The saltiness from the kalamata olives was nicely balanced by the sour dressing on the abundant arugula. There was a rather-loud band playing out front (A friday in January, about 8pm) and we were able to get a table for six in the back, without reservations, where it was quieter.  It's annoying that the menu they hand you does not list the vegetarian options they have available; ask for the vegetarian menu. The excuse we were given was that the type would be too small if they added the vegetarian options to the existing menu. That excuse would not apply to the online menu listed at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nolaonthesquare.com%2Fmenu.html&s=ca83fa09b3c74a802ad70f8dfe0d5b8a65e2485f15ba4fb58fb7ad783fb8862c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">nolaonthesquare.com/menu...</a> , but I don't see the vegetarian menu items listed there, either.

There was so much heavily seasoned sausage that it really muted out a lot of the other flavors I was enjoying. I ended up pushing several pieces of it to the side. I should say here that it's been my experience in this part of the US that restaurants seem to serve a lot of processed meats like sausage and cold cuts so if you're not used to that it can be overwhelming.  The scallops were not fresh at all and poorly prepared. One was so fishy tasting that I couldn't eat it. I was really disappointed since I love scallops and this wasn't a cheap meal.  Nice ambiance and the service was great but sadly I wouldn't recommend.",

They serve up very tasty and almost authentic New Orleans Cuisine.    I ordered the shrimp po'boy and it came with 5 huge fried shrimp served up on a soft Italian bread.   The breading was quite tasty but you could tell that the shrimp was not seasoned properly and was slightly overcooked.  The slaw that came on it was sweet too even though the description was Cajun Slaw, Spicy Papaya Ravigote.  I expected it to me spicy!  To my dismay they only had one type of hot sauce - Tabasco.  Come on my friend if you want to serve New Orleans cuisine you better serve food that is spicy and have a selection of hot sauces to choose from. My friend ordered a Croque Monsieur, which she really enjoyed because of the hand carved ham.  For dessert we shared a banana bread pudding with caramel ice cream.  The ice cream had a ridiculous amount of caramel in it, and was very overpowering.  The bread pudding was good on it's own.     A few additional grips: it's slightly expensive for lunch (our bill was about $40 total with tip+tax for two people), and waitstaff is overattentive (i had about 4 people come towards me as I walked through the door to be seated, proceeded by our waitress who came back every minute, literally to ask if we were ready to order).....  Alas, I'd still come back for the food.  Tip: portions are huge so bring your appetite, or a partner to share!",

The panini was yum too.   The only problem with this place is that the service is ridiculously slow. It has been a while since I waited 30 minutes after I ordered to have my food served. I don`t know if it is because it was a lunch time during a weekday, or if it is their usual routine. But I would recommend carving time on your calendar longer than the usual if you would like to go this place during the week and sit down to enjoy your lunch.   Highly recommend it - will try the drinks next time which I heard are also really good!",

I have only tried a few dishes at Nola, as I have a shellfish allergy and shellfish factors heavily into the menu.  The catfish is my favorite, though I am not a fan of the sides.  It comes with a \"corn-potato maque-choux\" which (excuse the graphic description) basically looks like corn and potatoes someone already ate.  It is a watery, loose mess on the plate.  Good news is that you can substitute other sides for it.  The beignets sat in my stomach like rocks for the rest of the afternoon after I split this dessert with a friend.  The service is hit or miss. I have had great service and I have had absent service.  They have been very accomodating with larger group (8-12).",

We went during our lunch hour and found the restaurant itself was not very busy, which was nice because we were seated quite quickly. Our server and the rest of the staff were very polite and attentive. Opening the menu, it was pretty small in terms of food options, normally I take this as a sign that its a restaurant that likes to specialize and only focuses on the freshest and best dishes, however these guys were clearly an exception to the rule. I myself ordered the shrimp and grits which was probably the most expensive menu item (though not that expensive), and I can't recall what my coworkers got, however I must say that when the food came out I was very, very underwhelmed. There was absolutely no kick to the food that one expects to find when visiting a \"New Orleans\" style restaurant and the portions were sub-par to say the least. I'd also note that the food in of itself was just kind of there, it wasn't bad nor was it good in terms of quality, just bland and I've had better for the price. In the end, I wouldn't recommend this place, at least not as a lunch spot, who knows, maybe their dinner specials/happy hours are what actually keep them in business, but I won't be one chomping at the bit to find out.",

This is the same team that brought us the top-notch Sonoma Grille and Seviche, and it shows in their glossiness and attention to detail. Their only big failing is that they are a little too conservative with the spices.   It's not vegetarian-friendly or waistline friendly, but it sure is tasty. The soup and sandwich lunch special may be the best bang-for-your-buck at a higher end downtown restaurant. Don't miss the French Onion soup - which could be a sizable lunch on its own.   Nola is a good, fun addition to Market Square, and it sure does buzz on a weekday afternoon as well as a weekend afternoon. Stop by next time you're craving cajun.",

I ordered the fried alligator appetizer , gumbo soup and jumbalia for dinner. If you haven't tried alligator, do yourself a favor and do. Great dish with smoky thousand island dressing sauce.   The gumbo soup was spicy and hearty. I'm going to look into making my own for cold winter nights after this experience.  The scallops and shrimp in the jumbalia were very well cooked, it as well was served (physically) HOT and spicy, it was everything I could ask for. When I asked for the hottest hot sauce they had, it was delivered. Not just Franks Red Hot like I'm normally served. It was a unique brand of fire death. Perfect.  Overpriced yeah. But I left with a new taste for cajun cooking. I did not want to rate this establishment 5 stars, but I had too.",

    "text": "Amazingly delicious! is my first comment. Must try it!  This is our first ever visit to Pittsburgh and my wife and I enjoy new foods. We ate lunch today in Market Square and the waitress recommended a neighboring restaurant called Nola's for dinner. She explained they have a jazz band and the food is good. We walked over after lunch to make a reservation. The earliest was fir 9:15 because \"it's Saturday night\" the friendly host said. When we arrived the band was playing easy jazz music and laughter filled the restaurant. We were seated immediately and likewise greeter by Greg our waiter. He sports a great handlebar mustache.  We looked over the menu and decided to choose the frog legs appetizer. We never had them before - another first. They were quickly served in a mushroom in lemon and bacon sauce that was so succulent we immediately decided we would try other items on the menu we've never had.  We then tried the fried alligator also off the appetizer menu. Again it arrived shortly thereafter. Amazingly savory spicy flavors with the alligator.  We the had the oyster stew. Again a deliciously savory taste to the stew.  Continuing on with the theme for the night we had the wood roasted quail. Another first. It's served on a bed of rice pilaf and cranberry Pinot noir with fresh asparagus.  This was and evening if firsts and we truly enjoyed topping our visit to Pittsburgh. My wife and I have been married for over 31 years and she has always enjoyed great food. Nola's was an experience which quickly and easily jumps to the top of our list of favorite places to eat.  Great food, great service in a great environment accompanied the great companionship with my wife.",

We had a res but we started in the bar for a couple.  The bartenders were friendly actually they must have messed up a dish in the kitchen because we were offered a whole entree while we were at the bar (we accepted).   We sat down at our table which was in a booth on the other side of the bar, not quite as lively but it was cozy.  We ordered the crocodile and frog legs.  I wasn't a huge fan of the frog but the 'dile was good (it was fried and tossed in an aioli so that might have helped).  I ordered the catfish with rice and beans.  I wasn't a huge fan of my dish.  I guess its a NoLa thing to put pork in black beans ( i was bummed because I don't eat pork).   My friend ordered the shrimp and grits which sounded delish.  When she got it is was floating in oil. She said the flavor was good but way too oily.   Pro: Knowledgeable server, lively bar, market square, crocodile was good.   Cons: Extra oily food, not very veg friendly.   Overall: I am glad I tried this place but maybe NoLa style food isn't my thing.",

We were over 30 minutes late for our reservation due to traffic and weather, but were still seated almost immediately.  We let the host and our server know that we had theater tickets, so we were kind of restricted on time, especially since we arrived late.    Our server thanked us for letting him know and was very attentive throughout our meal and got us out in plenty of time for the show.  He was also very knowledgeable on menu.    We shared the Crispy Fried Alligator which was perfectly light and crisp and tasty.  My daughter opted for a bowl of French Onion Soup.  As soon as hers arrived, it smelled so fantastic that I ordered a bowl too.  The veal broth, vermouth and caramelized onions made for a slightly sweet, total delectable soup.   If you love French Onion Soup, be sure to try this one.  You won't be disappointed.   My daughter got the Steak Frites et Salade.  Perfectly cooked steak, tasty fries and salad.  She enjoyed it.  I got the Seafood Jambalaya.  Perfectly caramelized rice, seasoned with a pleasantly spicy kick,  plump scallops & shrimp, generous pieces of sausage and crispy chicken drummettes.  Definitely another hit.   And sitting near the kitchen, we could see the desserts and had been eying them since we sat down.    We decided to share a Bananas Foster.  It was made with moist delicious banana bread pudding, crispy sweet banana fritters and homemade rich luscious caramel ice cream.  Every bite was amazing.   We'll definitely eat there again!",
