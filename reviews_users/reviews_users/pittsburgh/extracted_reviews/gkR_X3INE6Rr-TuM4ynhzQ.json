We ended up trying a lot of their drinks and food, so here's my thoughts...  The menu is small but comprehensive. There's something for everyone - from the classic, juicy burger or melt-in-your-mouth short ribs to the flavorful octopus and hush puppy dish. Then there's the ode to Pittsburgh's ancestral roots with perfectly seared pierogi and a haluski and kielbasa dish. The haluski was amazing and I don't like kielbasa but it was a hit with my friends. It was gorgeous and smelled so good - not something I say about kielbasa often. I do have to say that our table's favorite dish ended up being the chicharones - spent grain fried up and served with cheese. Light and crunchy deliciousness with cheese... Yes please.   I was so happy that they serve spirits and wine at this brewery since I don't like beer. The rum punch is my new favorite drink in all of Pittsburgh. So dang yummy. They also serve R Winery wines, as well as local whiskey. My husband really liked their double IPA while our friends enjoyed their sour beer.   Such a great new staple brewery in a great location.",

    "text": "This was my 2nd time here this weekend and my 5th time overall. From the service to the food to the beer, this brewery/restaurant is a great addition to Pittsburgh. The other 30 + breweries in Allegheny County (with the exception of a few) either don't have food or have rotating food trucks. Today my husband and I celebrated Valentine's Day early and went for Sunday brunch. The veggie omelette with rapini and chive/cheddar cheese (honestly don't remember exactly what it was) was flavorful and a generous portion.  The breakfast potatoes popped with spices (not spicey though) and peppers. My only regret is that there wasn't more of them! My hubby and I are beer geeks and I'm a member of the group Pittsburgh Beer Ladies, but today I opted for the Bloody Mary.....it did not disappoint. Sarah's a great mixologist! Spicy and had pickled vegetables...again I would have eaten a plate of them! It even came with a \"sidecar\" of their Cobra Toes Kolsch.  Our server Brie described the toaster pastries so well that I couldn't resist them.  Handmade pastry with apple pear jam and foie gras?!?!? Topped with jam made with their Berliner Weisse that appeared as little golden bubbles! The icing also had foie gras and also had toasted fennel seed! Friday night I had the pastrami sandwich with pickled peppers.........total yumminess! My favorite beer tonight was Sand County the Coffee Wit......combining coffee and  a wheat beer is not something I would typically drink but putting the two together was delicious! I also had the Room Tone NE IPA which combined fruity and hoppy and for me that's just the kind of IPA I've been drinking and enjoying lately. The space is warm and inviting. I wouldn't change a thing! Can't wait to see what's next in their beer lineup!",

So when Church Brew Works was closed on a Friday evening, I was excited to find that Cinderlands was not far away. The Diner Burger in the restaurant was a delicious notch above the slider. With bacon, cheese, and an added egg, it was just the right amount of messy and full delicious. My only criticism would be that I would have rather it had a slightly larger, single patty instead of two smaller ones. But, that is just personal preference. This burger is absolutely worthwhile.",

Each beer was good. The crowler (mini-growler can) option was nice for taking some to go if you forgot your growler or want a smaller volume to go.  We only had appetizers. The scotch eggs were amazing. It was super crispy and the mustard was fantastic. It was really unexpected to see a soft boiled egg inside but really worked. If your a scotch egg person, you've got to try one.  As a note, we visited once during the Lawrenceville cookie tour. They had fantastic cookies. The cookies are sadly not on the menu.",

We were seated in the back room which was full and while I loved the aesthetic of the big open room, it was very loud and difficult to have a conversation. The menu is limited but everything on it sounds amazing. I decided to go with the fried chicken sandwich and my husband ordered the soft shell crab. One of the reasons we chose to come here is that it's so rare to see a restaurant offer soft shell crab around here! We both enjoyed our sandwiches but were a little disappointed by the fries. I love shoestring fries but these were lacking crunch and flavor. As far as beer, I tried both the saison and chai beer. I found them to be just okay, but did appreciate how unique the beer offerings were and would definitely come back when they rotate their selection. Overall, I'd give this place a 3.5/5. Has potential to be exceptional, but as it is, it's just okay.",

The Brussel sprouts were really good but the Caesar dressing overwhelmingly tasted of anchovies. Additionally, I got the fried chicken sandwich and it was so over cooked that I stopped eating after the first bite :/ but if it had been cooked properly, I believe I would have enjoyed the flavors.  Unfortunately, our waitress was not the friendliest and spoke fairly condescendingly to us the majority of the time. I almost spoke to the manager to request a new server. (Which says something because I was in the service industry for years).  The food was clearly made of good and local ingredients. Unfortunately, the delivery was missing. But that, on top of the poor service, makes me doubtful that if I'll be returning.",

I mean, I love craft beer but when I am out to have some, I do not want a \"lager\". Not a fan of IPA's. The lager however was good.

The food was also excellent, I got the diner burger and a few in our party got the beef brisket which looked awesome and so did the schnitzel sandwich!   The only reason I did not give this review a higher rather is because the service was not good. The entire group that I was with are all current or previous bartenders and servers so we understand being busy and how the restaurant industry works! It was a slow sunday evening and our large group of friends seemed annoy the waitress whose section we ended up in which was on the main floor near the bar. They didn't seem to want to wait on us and finally offered us a private second floor space which was great! Being that it was slow, we thought that perhaps the waitress would be excited to make money off of us but she did not come by very often and half of our group had to make frequent trips down to the bar to keep fresh drinks. The place closed at 10:00pm and the waitress brought us checks by 9:00pm not even offering last call, clearly wanting to be done with her shift.   Overall, i would go back for the food and give it another shot!",

    "text": "I stopped here earlier today with my wife for lunch.  The previous day I had read an online article that Cinderlands Brewing was opening the next day.  Since the infamous Lawrenceville Cookie Walk was going on I thought it would be a great day to grab lunch with my wife and then do the cookie tour.  We arrived to the restaurant right around 11:30 and were told we were the first sit down customers which was pretty cool.  They proceeded to take us to the back room which is a fairly open space with some cool string lighting.  Beyond that they also had a front room with booths on one side and a bar on the other.  Last but not least it looked like they had some seating upstairs as well.   As I often do whenever I visit new breweries I decided to order a flight of beer.  They didn't exactly have a flight but instead had 5 oz pours for $2.50 and so I ordered all 5. All of the beers were actually really good with my favorites of the bunch being the passionfruit whipper (it reminded me of Hawaii) and the IPA (bright and hoppy) which should surprise no one who knows me.  Then for our lunch my wife and I started with spent grain chiccarones (vegan except for the beer cheese) and I went with the brisket sandwich for my entree.  Our chiccarones came out first and they were absolutely delicious.  The chiccarones themselves were light and crispy and dipping them into the beer cheese was heaven.  The beer cheese was good enough that I probably would have eaten just about anything in it.  After we had finished with our appetizers the entrees came out.  Both my entree and my wife's looked great and we dug in.  The brisket sandwich was tasty as the exterior bread of the sandwich had a nice crust to it (a baguette) while the inside was meaty and juicy. The brisket was super tender and tasty and I especially enjoyed the red cabbage addition to it.  I only wish that the mustard which I got on the last 1/4 of the sandwich had been more evenly spread.  It came with a side of fries which were also really good and seasoned nicely.  They were super thin (almost shoestring) which allowed them all to be crispy without a single one being overdone.  The only miss on the dish for me was the tallo aioli but that probably goes down to a personal preference instead of it actually being not good. My wife ended up loving her Brassica which had some great Thai flavors to it.  The bottom line for me is I would head back here again in the future.  All of their beers were really good (some of the best that I have had recently) and their food was delicious too!  As far as a grand opening goes it was incredibly successful too as everything ran smoothly and we even had both the chef and owner talk to us before we left.",

The vegetable side dishes we shared as a group are fantastic and just about enough for a small meal. I also tried the Spent Grain Chicharrones with beer cheese which are my new favorite appetizer. I love that are sustainable and vegan- of course the cheese takes it up a notch so I would recommend enjoying that with it. My dining companions were equally impressed with their food offerings and I'll definitely be back to try more!",

The overall seating arrangement is odd. It's like half speakeasy, half dining area.  Service: There is maybe only one other time that I've felt as rushed by a bartender as I did last night. First off, the place wasn't even that busy on a Friday at 8:30. My friend and I ordered a couple of drinks and I got some pierogis. I finished up my plate, got a box, but my friend was still drinking. He brings the checks...we don't put our cards in them. He comes back 5 minutes later and says \"i put these here for you ladies\". Yep, we can see them, thanks!   Food: the pierogis were good! Very flavorful and with the pickled onions it was a nice touch. Drink: I had a whiskey apple shrub which was very tasty. I also had the passionfruit Weisse and... no ma'am... will not get that again.  Overall, meh. I could take this place or leave it.",

The three stars is for the sweet potato fries, which were actually quite delicious.

My boyfriend and I stumbled upon it during the Lawrenceville cookie tour, and it happened to be their first day open.  The place itself is really cool! They highlighted some of the unique details of the old building they're in and incorporated lots of brick and subway tile, which I loved! The space was huge too, both big parties and small parties alike could easily feel comfortable there.  There were only 5 beers on tap, but they seemed to have a good mix of different styles.  My boyfriend ordered the NE IPA and I ordered the Berlinner Weisse.  The Berlinner Weisse had a tart and fruity taste, so if you're a fan of sour beers then I would definitely recommend it!  I didn't try any of the food, but everything on the menu sounded delicious!  I would love to come back with a group of friends and try more!!!",

    "text": "My husband, seven month old daughter, and two friends met at Cinderlands in March and had a fantastic experience! Though the entrance is small and assuming, the interior is beautifully updated in an industrial aesthetic and twice as large as I had anticipated. I was skeptical about taking my infant, and she was initially the first child in the restaurant. However, (thankfully) she was well behaved, and eventually, one or two other children arrived as well.  The beers were literally made for us! My friend and I love Belgians, and there were two delicious Belgian offerings on the menu that weekend. I also enjoyed trying a rich stout and a crisp pale ale (which I loved, though I normally dislike that style). Everything that we ordered hit the spot!  The food delivered as well. We ordered a number of things including the Marcona Almonds, Pierogies, Scotch Egg, and Brussel Sprouts. The Scotch Egg was definitely the table's favorite dish, and we inhaled the two that we ordered.  I had a fantastic experience at Cinderlands and can't wait to return in the future! Do keep in mind that the menu -- particularly the beers -- change frequently, so have an open mind every time that you come here.",

Packed with thirty something crowd, noisy and fun, we were in the upstairs loft with a group of six. The drink menu is limited but good. I had the IPA (beer) which was good. Others had bottled cokes, wine and beer. The food is also a pretty short menu but covers all the bases I had the crab sandwich which was good. Maybe switch to a different bread if you get it. Others had turkey which was probably very delicious, and a couple had pulled pork which also seemed yummy. We made a reservation since it was Saturday night and we had a big group. Otherwise seating looks more like two tops and a bar.",

It's very modern/eclectic inside and I love the the overall aesthetic of the brewery. They have a few chairs for outside seating (although it was way too cold out for that) and a lot of seating inside (tables, booths, and bar seating).   They do have a food menu, as well. We didn't order anything as we just wanted to try their beers at the time. I had the Blazing Crude which was a coffee based beer and was really yummy. Others ordered the Stack which was also pretty tasty.   I definitely want to go back and try the food, too. They have Haluski and pierogies on the menu - how Burgh is that? :)",

They don't have a large menu, looks like there's usually one featured entree and a small variety of sandwiches. This to me should mean that they knock these sandwiches out of the park. I ordered the Chicken Bacon Ranch sandwich. The fried chicken itself was solid. The cheese was maybe 10% of the way melted and tasted like an old velveeta slice. The bacon was extremely thin and looked like it was made the day before. The bun was just a plain potato bun that I would buy at shop and save.   I was so disappointed in the sandwich. I asked the waitress about it and she said the chicken sandwich there is very popular and they never get complaints. Maybe I just had a bad sandwich but it's turned me off from ever going there again.",

The food is creatively prepared and everything is rather delicious. For example, the apple and smoked goat cheese in the Brussels Sprouts made it a tasty combination.   Our server knew the menu quite well and was able to make helpful suggestions.  My only criticism is there could be a few more vegetarian entrees.  There are several veggie sides, enough to make a meal, bit nothing much to choose from on the entrees without making substitutioms.   Cinderlands is a place to keep coming back to.",

    "text": "We had the best time here this past Easter.  We decided to take a vacation from the holiday and just do our own thing.  So after church we went to brunch then began to look for a place that was local that had some great beers and was actually open.  A phone call later and we were headed to Cinderlands.  To my surprise they also serve a brunch and it looked pretty good, but we were there for a few libations.  This was our 4th time to this brewery.  On our first visit, which was the day after Christmas, and maybe a month after they opened, we had a fabulous time.  I tried almost all of their drafts that day and seriously loved them all.  Plus we were there in the middle of the week so the place was not busy and we had plenty of room.  On subsequent visits we have run into mass crowds and not such a comfortable atmosphere, but this last visit ranks up there with our first.  There were no seats available at the bar, which is usually our go-to spot, but in the back there were several booths available.  This was nice in a few ways.  One I was never back there before and it is so cutely decorated, and two it was away from the door so we didn't have to deal with the blast of cold air every time someone entered or exited.  Our server was a very nice and attentive young lady who didn't even seem to mind working the holiday.  They had a NE IPA on tap named, Type-Two Fun.  We have been on an NE IPA kick for months now!  Their take on the brew was excellent.  Great full body, golden cloudy color, with gentle bitterness and light tones of orange.  Delicious and growler worthy!  But we didn't have a growler so we settled for a few pints.    We spent the rest of the afternoon people watching, summer planning, and just kicking it while soaking in this lovely space and tasty drinks.  Thank you for a pleasant Easter afternoon Cinderlands.",

I had a pint of their Cream Ale & then a taster of their coffee porter, which is highly recommended-delish! I ordered a burger without fries & they subbed some of their Brussels sprouts for a small up charge, which was fine by me. I just missed happy hour since theirs is early I think 4-6:30. Food was good, nice atmosphere & place was packed by 7pm. I'd definitely stop in again when in Lawrenceville.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this place, and Restaurant Week seemed like a good time!   It is a little different than the other breweries in Lawrenceville, because it is set up like a restaurant that also brews their own beer, as opposed to the other way around. We did not make a reservation, but I recommend doing so if you plan on coming for dinner via Open Table (esp if you have more than 2 people).  We arrived about 6:45 on a Friday and were told it would be about a 90 minute wait. There didn't seem to be too many people standing around, so we decided to just wait it out and luckily, something opened up after about 10 minutes or so.   Both myself and my boyfriend ordered from the Restaurant Week special menu. The \"deal\" of a sandwich and a beer for $20.19 was not really a special in itself looking at the prices of food and brews on the regular menu, but we were interested in the sandwiches. I ordered the Meatloaf Sandwich and it was 10/10. I normally would not order meatloaf at a restaurant but it was pictured online, and it looked amazing. I was not disappointed. He ordered the Parmesan Chicken sandwich, which he did not like. It was prepared  using chicken thigh, which was too greasy and just not good as part of this dish. Seasoned shoestring-style fries were good and overall, portions were very generous.  We were pleased with the beers on tap. They had about 6 different options available at the time-- all their own brews. There was nothing super special or unique about them, but there was one of each style (pilsner, IPA, sour, stout, etc.), so I think that most beer drinkers could find at least one that they liked. I noticed that there were about 15 taps, so I imagine that they will be adding more beers to the list as they continue to expand and grow their business.   Service was great. Our waiter was very friendly and the wait-staff seemed to work as a time to make sure that everyone was taken care of. Our water glasses were never empty!   I would definitely return for dinner and a beer. The menu is pretty small so be sure to check it out beforehand. You can actually see the kitchen if you are sitting in the front part of the restaurant and it is pretty small itself. You can tell that they put a lot of effort into having good, quality food that pairs well with their beers.   If anyone from the restaurant is reading this, please make the Meatloaf Sandwich a staple on your menu :)",

It was bad enough a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday night, I had to endure such lovely tunes from Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie, and some obscure screaming death metal at ear bleeding noise levels, now I can't even go for a bite to eat without dying of heat exhaustion.  No wonder the severs look miserable.  They have to endure a pain I will no longer pay for.  Regardless, the service and food is always phenomenal, but lately with the music taste on the weekends and heat levels has made this place unbearable.  I hope they fix this soon because I really did enjoy this place until these past weekends.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I were searching for a brunch place earlier today as we were making Sunday plans and eventually we settled on Cinderlands.  So, after hitting up the Squirrel Hill farmer's market, we meandered--thanks to a random road closure and Waze seeming to no understand Pittsburgh--our way to Cinderlands.  We were greeted by the lovely staff there and our waiter gave us our menus with a smile, immediately apologizing for being \"a little over energized because i'm over-caffeinated,\" which made both of us laugh.  He was quite attentive throughout our meal and super insightful on the beers currently on tap (she had the POG Whipper & I got the Grizzled Canary) both of which we loved and completely recommend if you enjoy very fruit flavored beers.  Then came our food.  Our waiter gave us several recommendations, but we ended up settling on the French Toast and Smoked Fish Scramble (for her and myself respectively) with an order of the potatoes to split.  We like trading bites of each others meal, as we often pick things the other was considering when we eat out, and after an initial bite each on the potatoes we were hooked on them and the rest of our food.  The description of the potatoes, in my opinion, does not do that simple dish (which perfectly fits as an appetizer) justice. My Smoked Fish Scramble was simple and wonderful and is strongly recommended as well.  But, it was the French Toast that pushed us both over the edge.  The bread was fluffy and savory and the \"lime curd\" as well as the peach and mint took the flavors of the dish to a whole new, very refreshing and summery, level that we both have been raving about all day.    Hands down this was one of our favorite brunches from the summer and in recent memory and we both also loved the overall aesthetic in the back section by the bar.    We'll be back!",

Crossing the river also meant crossing over to a top notch service experience and higher end decor.  The place is bright and airy even though it's a narrow space.  We garnered a spot at the bar and ordered some beer and food.  I tried the Stellar Peak and my \"better half\" sampled the Kolsch beer.  I loved the IPA and sour fruit play on the Stellar and found it to be super refreshing and drinkable.  The Kolsch was really solid too.    For food, we ordered the Octopus for $15 that came on a bed of collard greens, navy beans, chimichurri, and pine nuts with a side of hushpuppies.  The dish was sort of lacking in flavor, sad to say, because it looked beautiful.  The octopus was grilled but not seasoned very well and the collard greens were sparse and cut too small to get a nice toothy bite.  The freshly made hushpuppies were sublime and we both thought they should create a dish featuring those with a dipping sauce as they truly could stand on their own.  Our bartender was outstanding!  He was prompt and attentive to us while serving up armloads of beer, crafting cocktails that looked divine, and slinging food orders. We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "We stopped here a few weeks after they opened and came back on a return visit a few weeks later because we liked it so much.  We really like Cinderlands beer.  When we first came here the bartender gave us some samples to introduce us to their type of beer.  I'm not a big Ipa fan but I love their Ipas here and my wife does too.  When I taste their beer it's very good and refreshing.  Beer doesn't always make you feel that way but their beer does.  We tasted a lot of their different beers and we liked most of them.  My wife loves their Ipa called Stack and they just came out with their Littlefoot which I enjoyed on our last visit.  I probably liked the other beers they had on our previous visit but this was still a very good Ipa.         On our first visit it wasn't too busy at first but it started to get busy later in the day.  It was the day after Christmas.  On our second visit it was busy because it was a Saturday evening and playoff football was on.  They have a lot of seating in the back but in the very front is the bar.  They have seats along the wall, about a 13 seat bar, and a bar right in front of their open kitchen which is neat. The heat from the kitchen kept us warm on a bitterly cold Pittsburgh Saturday night!       The workers that we have encountered here all seem pretty nice.  They work good together and it is a good environment.  It has to be because if you sit at the bar there is a lot going on in front of you.  That is probably the only thing that I don't like about Cinderlands if you sit at the bar.  Since the kitchen is open and right next to you there is a lot of movement but it still doesn't take away from their beer and it's still a really good atmosphere.  We watched football on the second night and had a great time.  They have a food menu that I think is a little expensive but it is different.  There are a lot of interesting items on their food menu.   I don't know if we will ever eat here but we will be back for their great beer.",

Hip atmosphere, passionate staff, these people are very confident in what they are offering: great beers and a menu that's full of unexpected gourmet flavor. For dinner we tried the hot chicken sandwich and switched out the fries for a marinated kale salad that was so good we had to order more. Kale salad was drenched in lemon juice, olive oil, chili pepper and feta cheese. Delicious and yet so simple! The chicken was also excellent! For a side plate we tried the dates wrapped in bacon- they were awesome. Can't wait to return the next time we venture out to Lawrenceville!",

    "text": "I visited Cinderlands for the 2nd time and thought I should update my review! We visited on a Sunday evening around 6:00 pm- it wasn't too busy at the time and we found a table easily. Last time I visited, I was a little disappointed that I didn't try more beers, so I made a point to try more this time! First and foremost, the descriptions for the beers are ON POINT. They perfectly describe the flavors of the beer and the magic that happens in your mouth. Although they don't have a large selection of beer, I am totally ok with that at a brewery, because they are actually making these beers from scratch. I was also personally excited to see they had two sours on tap, as sour beers are my current FAV. Here are the beers I tried:  Grizzled Canary: Lemony aroma with a sour and slightly sweet taste and a hint of herb in the back of your tongue. REALLY good. 4/5 Bog Whipper: Carbonated orange citrus goodness. Deliciously sour. 3.5/5 Midnight Ramble: Literally tastes like a dark chocolate and raspberry chocolate bar. Dark tartness and the raspberry is there at the end. Full bodied and robust. 4/5  I loved the beer. For food, the boyfriend went with the spicy fried chicken sandwich (bleu cheese dressing / iceberg lettuce / pickles / martin's potato roll / $14) without the blue cheese dressing. I went with the winter salad (radicchio / belgian endive / fennel / red onion / cara cara orange / quince sherry mustard vinaigrette / $8) and the \"sweet potato\" (parmesan tempura / muhamarra / aleppo sumac honey / pickled chiles / cilantro / mint / $12) which was basically steamed sweet potato that was then fried (so it was super soft on the inside and crispy on the outside), served with a spicy indian-like sauce, herbs, and drizzled with honey. The sweet potato dish was absolutely delicious, but it is really spicy, so be cautious when ordering! The winter salad was not very good- it was entirely too bitter. All of the veggies are essentially pretty bitter on their own and the dressing didn't really take any bitterness away. The cara cara orange was also pretty bitter. I wouldn't order that again. Bren liked his sandwich a lot, but wasn't a fan of the seasoning on the fries.   Later in the evening, we met up with a group of friends here and I tried the spent grain chicharrones ($7) which are crispy and thin and I think it's so cool they make them with grains from their beer brewing process. What a cool way to re-purpose the grains! They were delicious and the beer cheese they were served with was good as well.  Overall, I had a great time at Cinderlands. I really want to come back and try more beers- especially when they do another collaboration with the Pittsburgh Juice Company!",

The staff is incredibly friendly and enjoys talking about both the beer and food menus. They must all be very involved in the process because both bartenders I have been served by knew a lot about the beer and food. More than just the normal memorization of the listings.   Drink must haves: the Coffee flavored IPA, the regular IPA, seasonal cocktail (can't remember the name but it was made with a local rye whiskey and our friend who is not a big drinker loved it so much he ordered another)  Food must haves: Chicken sandwich. The homemade pickles are soooo good! Brisket sandwich was out of this world!   I will update this post as I try new items but so far I am thoroughly impressed.",

Beer types are fleeting here, and part of the fun is showing up knowing you'll always get to try something new. That said, there are certain beers (ahemm Whispering Canary) that I wish would remain on the 3705 menu. I was also a bit disappointed to see that the entree menu was taken off. Sandwiches are great, don't get me wrong, but I actually think the intimate atmosphere at this location is better for entrees than the warehouse.   Tldr?

    "text": "My husband and I stopped by late one evening after having dinner down the road. We have had every intention of coming here but have never been in the area at the right time to take advantage of this brewery. Be prepared to park on the street (close or far depending on time of day) to Cinderlands (as with any business in Lawrenceville).   We sat at the bar in front of the kitchen area where the chefs were whipping up burgers, sandwiches and fries. One of the chefs was \"playing\" with a Korean styled mexican street corn dish that was to be put on the menu the following day. He explained the ingredients and flavors he was incorporating into the corn and performed several trials while we were there. This was really cool and unique to see as you do not often have access to view such a process in a restaurant much less interact with the chef!   The setup of the brewery itself was very unique. It was long and narrow, with the bar on one side of the wall and a single line of booths against the other wall that extended into the back of the building. It appeared as if they occupied two business spaces based on the length of the place. What caught my eye, following an open kitchen concept, was the large, high wooden shelving behind the bar with the beer taps below. It was a very dark wood, a stark contrast from the rest of the building with two TV's located in front of it to catch the next sports game. Also, by the front door, there was a high counter that allowed customers to sit inside or outside without a window in between. There was one guest with a dog sitting outside while she socialized with a gentleman across from her seated inside.  We were served quickly by a waitress who provided water for us while we looked over the menu. There were two sizes offered - a 5 oz option and a \"regular\" size option. The waitress allowed us to sample before ordering our beverage. I ordered a regular Cherry Lime Sour beer that was the perfect blend of sour with a hint of cherry and lime. I thoroughly enjoyed it!   I really enjoyed our experience here and would love to come back sometime soon. The food looked and smelled delicious, the beer was flavorful and True to its description, the prices were reasonable, and the employees were quick to serve and friendly.",

    "text": "Ordered the grilled cheese with crab - at least that is what I think I ordered, its not anywhere on their website menu. It had been good, but did not taste strongly of crab (which is why I now question it) and it had been very rich and heavy, with almost too much butter or oil or whatever it had been cooked in. The buffalo chicken rillettes were better, it was a buffalo chicken dip essentially, with bread and blue cheese. It packed a lot of punch in the small container it was served in. It was busy that night but the service was attentive, and while I dont drink beer, their selection seemed to be very wide and pleasing to all palates.",

The service was excellent and our stay at the bar felt like we were bellying up to our local, even though this was our first time here. My husband and I got the mushroom crostini and didn't catch the fact that it contained cashew cheese until after the fact. Score one for the vegans. We also got the Scotch egg; the sausage was tender and the egg runny. Perfect. Finished off our food sampling with the pierogi, which were also vegan and incredibly satisfying. As for the beers, I really dug the sours and my husband liked the Pilsner (non-dry hopped). The guava Berliner was particularly good. The wet-hopped IPA was too bitter for my taste, but the Objectively Enjoyable was balanced and smooth.",

First time being here the location appeared impeccably clean and well organized. The open concept allows you to see the food being prepared which is cool.   The burger was delicious! And the Brussels sprouts had great flavors. Fries were little and crispy!   Pilsner was crisp and smooth with more of their menu focused on IPA, it was nice to have a single beer dedicated to those of us with less hop desires. Hubby enjoyed sampling their beers, as he told me they recently came into the beer scene. Definitely taking some crowlers on our way out.",

    "text": "Cinderlands 3705 did a great job with a 2 story inside/outside remodel of the old building.  I was there for a lunch business meeting, so I can't talk about the beer offering at this point.  We started with 3 apps a soft pretzel, pierogis, and goat cheese curds.  The pierogis were fancier than most with the ingredients and were good.  The curds were very good as well with their sauce.  The soft pretzel was a basic soft pretzel and the cheese sauce did the trick.  For my meal I ordered the fried pig ear bahn mi.  It was a bit too hard core for me.  I couldn't get it down, but that's my fault I guess based on ordering a fried pig ear with pate.  The other entrees like grilled cheese and burgers looked good.  So if you don't like real bahn mi with pate don't risk it as adding a pig ear makes it more adventurous.",

The crowd it draws is mostly the young adults several years removed from college. At Cinderlands, they sat us quickly and in the upstairs balcony as well. It was a sleek yet cabinesque interior. There were all kinds of games (Apples to Apples, Scrabble, etc.) a group could play while they waited for their food or drink which was truly a nice addition.    The food pictured here is their kielbasa with noodles and the fries. While the prices aren't regular \"bar food\" level, it's for good reason. The portion sizes are huge and the quality is excellent. The drink menu is large too! This made for a fun evening, and I hope to be back soon!",

Cinderlands always has some great beers on tap, and they've been taking the Pittsburgh craft beer scene by storm, in an impressively short period of time. They always have delicious craft cocktails on the menu as well.  The ambiance at Cinderlands is great! The decor is clean and kind of cozy-industrial. When the weather is warm, you're able to sit at the double-sided open window at the storefront.   I've been wanting to try their fried chicken sandwich for weeks, and I finally got the chance. It was a bit spicy for me, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. My boyfriend was excited to stop by on a Wednesday for their SSBC (super secret burger club). This weeks burger offering was a triple decker burger with jalapenos, marinara, and mozzarella. It was fantastic, but a bit pricey at $18.   I'm always impressed by Cinderlands, especially the gourmet food they're able to crank out of their tiny kitchen. I'm super pumped for their new warehouse location to open!",

The perogies were exceptional.  The mustard  creme fraiche really made the dish.  The brussels sprouts were also an interesting dish.  The addition of the pomegranate really changed the flavor in a good way.  The red lentil falafel was rather disappointing.  Just bland.  No flavor here.  I could not finish it.

    "text": "I was searching through Yelp for a Sunday brunch spot and once again we ended up in Lawrenceville! Cinderlands to the rescue! Plenty of street parking and free on Sunday's. For being a small place it has quite a bit of seating, booths and a bar in the front, seating in the back of the restaurant and then more up in the loft area. I love how it was decorated, marble bar tops, dark wooden tables and a black and white patterned tile floor.   We took our time with the menu and finally decided on the French toast for myself and diner burger for my husband. He also ordered a POG Whipper beer, a super citrusy wheat beer.  We had quite a long wait for our food, but it was nice to be able to see the chef preparing our food right there from our table. Since it was a Sunday and we were brunching it was a nice time to chat and enjoy each other's company. When the food finally arrived and we started eating you could hear a pin drop. The food was FANTASTIC! Wow, what a great surprise.  The French toast was 7 sticks perfectly crisp on the exterior and tender in the middle. Layered on top of the most delicious lemon curd, topped with maple whipped cream, fresh peaches and mint. To. Die. For.   My husbands Diner Burger was another feast for the tastebuds. 2 patties cooked to an absolute perfect medium, still pink in the middle, bacon, sauce, and pickles. My husband's exact description for the pickles, \"they were ridiculous\"! They tasted sort of like they were brined in a vinegar and oil mixture. They are too difficult to describe, so do yourself a favor and get this burger to find out for yourself. The fries that it came with were THE BOMB! The chef blanches the fries in vinegar and then coats them in malt vinegar powder and salt. S&V fries!! Hello??!! So good.   So looking forward to coming back here again and ordering off the regular menu. Try it, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Wow!! BEST BURGER IVE EVER EATEN, seriously EVERRRER!!! My friend raved about a drunken meal eaten at this place. We decided to venture to it sober to see if the food was as good as he remembered. It was better!   I ordered the Diner burger. It's two beef patties (honestly, it could've been made with just one), bacon, American cheese, mayo and sweet steak sauce on a potato roll. I chose to top it with an egg based on the server's recommendation and it def did not disappoint! The burger was also accompanied by the most delicious salted-vinegar fries. I finished half the meal for dinner and was satisfactorily full! I ate the other half the next day and was still blown away by the flavor of this meal. Cinderlands has def set the bar for all my future burger experiences!   I also tried the Chai beer. If you like spiced beer, like pumpkin beer, or chai tea, I highly recommend this beverage.   Overall, I can't wait to visit Pittsburgh again and eat at Cinderlands! Their menu looks delicious and if it's anything like my burger experience, I think I might need to marry their chef! Lol. Ill def be adding this place to my recommendation of things to do in the city of three rivers. Kudos Cinderlands!!",

It is tough to find a decent Hefeweizen or IPA, standard offerings at most breweries. Otherwise it's a nice clean place that is welcoming. Maybe it was the wrong season, next time I hope the selection is better. I'm not that picky either, just want something not so experimental sometimes.",

We love trying all the new beers that are released, and are never disappointed. Everything is inventive, flavorful, and better then the last. My favorite beer so far was the Falling Petal sour collaboration with Umami, I have never had anything like it and hope it comes back. The employees are super knowledgeable about the brew process and can give you a full description of each beer. Their happy hour and new release specials are always a great perk when we come in on a week night. The food is always superb, our favorites are the fried chicken sandwich, soft shell crab sandwich, and mushroom \"risotto\". Each bite of everything we have ordered has been nothing short of delicious. Each time we have made reservations or had friends join us mid-seating, the restaurant has been super accommodating. My boyfriend and I have made Cinderlands our once a week spot, and we will keep coming back!",

The drinks were great-I had the daiquiri on the recommendation of our waitress (really good!) and my husband had the Old Man Joe which was one of the best old fashioned cocktails I've ever had.  The menu was so interesting that we over ordered because we wanted to try so many of the items. I'm not sorry that we did. For the Apps we ordered Marcona Almonds (soft lavender/tarragon flavors with garlic & sea salt), Buffalo Chicken Rillettes (these were amazing served with beer bread & rich blue cheese but the richness was cut with the crunchy, zesty pickled celery)-delicious!! We also shared the Pierogi (the filling was carmelized cipollini onions& Gouda), the Soft Shell Crab sandwich and the Scotch Egg. Everything was seasoned perfectly and almost everything was put together in front of us. The chef spent time talking to us and it was fascinating watching him work. I don't usually drink beer but we were offered a sample and it was really nice-it had a heavy citrus flavor and I wish I could remember the name of that one because I would order it again.  Don't miss this place-the food, drinks & atmosphere are fantastic!",

The food took forever to come out, but our waitress warned us that the kitchen was backed up and she kept checking in to make sure our beers were filled. Speaking of the beers... delicious! I see some folks commenting here that there weren't enough IPAs on the list, and to that I say THANK GOD. Hop heads are ruining the beer scene in the US these days to the point that those are typically ALL you see on draft lists with a Miller Lite and a random stout thrown in.  The beers at Cinderlands were balanced, crisp, bright, and so easy to drink. The Blithering Hayseed was my favorite.  My friends loved the pierogis and I had the brussel sprouts. They were done just right, the marcona almonds (one of my favorite things on the planet) were such a nice touch both with their buttery quality and crunch.   I'll be back for both the beer and brussels!",

Chicharrones crispy and amazing from spent grain from the brewing process. Bone marrow and pickled onions on beer bread nice combination. Beet pierogi yum! Not  too heavy but didn't miss the mark. The burgers juicy and so much flavor. Will definitely order those again. House made keilbasa was the best we ever had served with ribbon noodle haluski.Bread pudding and house made Pop tarts finished off a memorable feast. Already planning a return trip.

The beer has sometimes been great and sometimes middle of the road.  Example- the latest NEIPA has a flavor profile that just did not fit with what you would expect out of a hazy, and not in a positive way (like wet cardboard).  The Mango Berliner was nice though and I hope they have more winners like that.  Still, for how young they are, they are doing great.

The staff is warm and welcoming, I've never had bad service in a city that often times allows for aloof and sometimes lazy service. The beer, I could go on for hours about how good their beer is.  They nail every style I have had and have cashed in on the New England IPA hype with some killer soft juicy IPAs.  Although, my favorites have been their traditional often passed over styles.  Right now as I type I am craving both their Zwickel Lager and their Grisette, what other breweries in the city can you have those styles AND a NEIPA? Now, and probably most relevant to this space - the food.  Cinderlands again just doesn't disappoint.  They run 2 menus with very little overlap, the first is their dinner menu which doesn't overwhelm is tweaked for the seasons and is on point.  The second is the brunch menu which has been crushed by yours truly.  Bold statement incoming - Their burgers are top 3 if not best in the city. I could keep going, but go try for yourself - oh quick tip if you don't like beer they mix up some great cocktails using local spirits as well. Cheers!",

We had Brussels sprouts which were amazing and some perogies with parsnips, soured radicchio, and pickled mustard seed...a lot of flavor packed into these homemade dumplings.  I would have like a few more options but I'd rather see a limited menu with amazing food vs a large menu with bad food so all in all, good stuff.  The beer was pretty good.  I'd give the beer a 7.5 out of 10.  They do a decent IPA...their double IPA is delicious but at 9.8%, a little too strong for me for a lunch.  Also have a coffee IPA that was good if your a coffee fan.   Overall, another great addition to the Burgh's food scene and the beer was a great compliment to the meal so I'd definitely recommend.",

They have a variety of board games and card games and Jenga available up in the loft area. The chicharrones with beer cheese were delicious. My friend got the pierogies and did not care for them. Overall a great spot.",

We only stopped in for drinks after dinner somewhere else. Husband loved the beer! I had a cider that wasn't made in house. People next to us at the bar ordered food and it looked excellent. They commented on how good it was. Menu looked very interesting and I will be back to try it.  I'm super excited to try the brunch because it sounds soooo good! Great addition to Lawrenceville!",
