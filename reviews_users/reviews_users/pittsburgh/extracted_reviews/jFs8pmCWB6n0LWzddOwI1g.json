Some of my favorites on the menu are the sweet chili chicken boneless wings, the beet salad, the Parmesan crusted chicken, and the barbecue chicken flatbread! I recommend this restaurant to families and couples and friends dining out!",

    "text": "News flash - this restaurant was previously down the road and moved to this location a few years ago, so it's now in the Waterworks plaza area.  I didn't realize this and went to the old location on 1141 Freeport Rd - and saw a Mexican restaurant.    Not being familiar with the area, I'll admit I was slightly panicked as I had a baby shower to get to at this venue.  Luckily, I was able to call a friend and he told me that they moved and it was down the road close to Chili's.    It was a great venue to have an intimate gathering such as a baby shower.  It was co-ed baby shower so it was very relaxed and they were serving alcohol - awesome.  I decided not to partake in the alcohol consumption but enjoyed the spread of food they had.  The quesadillas were tasty and so was the hummus.  The spinach-artichoke dip seemed popular but I didn't try it.    The place is real classy and seemed to be popular for dinner on a Sunday evening.  Although we were in a private room - I took a peek at the restaurant side and saw that it was bumpin.    Overall the space/decor was great and the food was decent.  Although, I'm not sure that I'd make the trip all the way out here just to go to this place.",

    "text": "I've spent many an afternoon/evening at the Walnut Grove in Waterworks - mostly for happy hour, but sometimes for dinner as well.  The happy hour is pretty decent.  Although the prices have gone up since I last visited.  About a year ago, the ahi tuna was included on the half priced apps for happy hour menu.  For $5 you could get a nice sized piece of tuna - but it seems they caught on to the fact that they probably weren't making much money.    The service is usually OK - nothing special, but not awful either.  The one issue I have is that I just don't love their menu.  Some overpriced salads, a couple of pizzas - 2 are pretty much identical except for the addition of fries (it is Pittsburgh people, fries come on everything!).  A small sandwich selection and some seemingly overpriced entrees.    I'll give them 3 stars for happy hour, but maybe 2 for the menu and pricing.  But it's a convenient location and an alternative to heading downtown or to Lawrenceville when I'm in town and staying at Bakery Square.",

However, the waiter took my salad away--and said \"sorry.\" We ate and finished our dinner. I asked to speak to a manager. I told the manager \"Scott\"  that it as very unusual for a manager to never come to the table and apologize. I thought it would be customary for a manager to approach the table and share that he/she spoke to the kitchen, and maybe say this \"is unusual\" and maybe offer a free appetizer. Nope, \"Scott\" replied I thought \"Brittany\" (the 12 year old waitress) handled it. I am very disappointed-even Wendy's would have handled this better. Customer service is everything-all consumers should be treated as such.",

    "text": "I've  been to Walnut Grove several times for every meal (not so much since Burgatory opened across the parking lot, but that's another story).  Each time I've gone, I've had a pretty decent experience, but nothing too amazing.  The food is ok, but depending on who you have waiting on you, the service can be a little spotty (which I suppose is True for any restaurant).  The decor of the restaurant is tastefully done, but to be honest, I preferred the old location further down.  It felt more comfortable and intimate.  The one nice thing this location has to offer is very nice outdoor seating.  There's nothing better than having a couple of beers and making a meal of $5 appetizers on a beautiful evening.  It's just a shame there's nothing really to look at except the parking lot.  I'd say that if you're looking to go, go during happy hour for the drink and appetizer specials or for the Sunday brunch buffet.  It's not worth it so go for the regular menu because I don't think the prices are in line with the quality of the food.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I have decided to finally take this restaurant off our list since our last 2 visits have been less than positive. Most recently, we made reservations for New Year's Eve for 3 people for 7PM. We arrived about 10 minutes early and still had to wait till about 7:15 before we were seated. During our wait, we sat at an open table near the bar where we proceeded to order a couple drinks. However, the beers listed on the chalkboard menu on the wall weren't up to date. So the server had to keep running back and forth to the bar to verify the available drafts. We finally got to our table and ordered. Although our food showed up in a timely manner, the \"fresh\" veggies were mush and the food was accompanied by gnats. They were flying all over the place, landing on the table, on the wall, my boyfriend spent half the time swatting them away...but it was tough to gain the attention of our server as she was immersed in what must have been a very interesting conversation with a customer nearby. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the manager reduced our bill. They couldn't move us due to the fact that all the tables had scheduled reservations. Finally, when we had our food boxed up since we didn't want to eat with the gnats, they boxed up and gave us some of the wrong food....it was just comical at that point.  Our visit prior to New Year's Eve happened on a late afternoon on a weekend. We seated ourselves at a booth near the bar. It took almost 15 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge us! Even though there were servers in the area and walking past us multiple times, there was not acknowledgment. When our server finally appeared, she reeked of cigarette smoke...to the point that it was just offensive! We ordered our food and I had the Ahi Tuna, which I wouldn't recommend ordering again because it didn't seem fresh at all. It tasted frozen actually.",

Monday and Tuesdays feature cheap burgers, there are drink specials daily, and the staff is always friendly. We have begun to frequent Walnut Grill, and have yet to be disappointed.   Oh! Make sure you ask for bread if they don't bring it out to begin with. It is made right there, comes out warm, and always has some interesting things to spread on.   The buffalo chicken wrap is good too.   My only complaint here is that the Guinness is served in a tulip shaped glass, but is a significantly lower volume than a real Guinness glass (12 ounces here, vs 16 with an American Pint Glass, or 20 with a European glass).   We love this place, and recommend that people try it out!",

We sat on the patio, there were lights romantically strung above us and beautiful landscaping around to create some privacy from the parking lot. The entire restaurant was clean and tidy.  We ordered Loaded Tater Tots as an appetizer and received them in a timely manner with the jalapenos on the side like I asked.  Our drinks were never less than half full.  My boyfriend ordered the House Cut Filet Mignon rare with asparagus and a sweet potato.  His filet was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing, as well as the sides.  Steaks never come out cooked correctly for him so he was thrilled!  I ordered the new Smoked Pork-Tip Mac N' Cheese it was delicious and the portion was very large. All together our time there was wonderful and we would recommend Walnut Grill to anyone! We will definitely be going back!",

The bread was warm and delicious with a choice of 3 spreads. I didn't care for the chocolate chip butter, but the whipped butter and hummus were good. The calamari appetizer was half fried calamari (a little chewy but tasty) and half fried hot peppers. Of all the many places where I've ordered fried calamari, this was the skimpiest amount of calamari I've gotten. It should have been, at most, 4 hot peppers and the rest calamari. My daughter is vegetarian and she had very limited options. Not even a pasta dish without meat or seafood! I'm sure we could have ordered an entree and had them hold the meat, but we'd be paying the same amount, while the restaurant saves money on the meat or seafood. She ended up with a salad, which she enjoyed. One of our friends had the same salad and she said it was okay. The rest of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals: seafood pesto pasta, fish tacos, lobster mac & cheese, and vegetable flatbread. All in all, the food was very good and we had a nice, pleasant meal. But we probably won't be back until they put more vegetarian options on the menu.",

    "text": "Overall: poor service, overpriced, nice atmosphere, food was blah to average. I won't go back and would not recommend to others.   We attended the Fox Chapel Walnut Grill for brunch on Father's Day. The hostess took our party of 5 (4 adults, 1 child) to our booth which was near enough to the buffet area for easy access but secluded enough not to be bothered by the traffic. None of us had been to this restaurant before and we were unfamiliar with the setup, especially for the brunch buffet. I asked the hostess if we needed to wait to place drink orders and where the buffet was located. She waved in the direction of another dining area where the buffet was setup and said everything is in there and walked away. We sat for a few minutes and the waitress came to the table and asked if we wanted anything to drink. We asked what the choices were, as we didn't have menus, and she seemed confused by this question. She asked if we wanted menus and I said we're here for the brunch buffet but can you tell us the drink options. She then said they had Coke products. My husband asked for sweetened tea - they didn't have it. She ended up bringing menus and said we could order from the menu or get the buffet - we didn't know this was a choice as most restaurants serving a special brunch buffet do not also have kitchen service (except for special orders). We took a look at both the buffet and the menu and decided to go for the buffet since that's why we actually came. It's important to note that online the buffet is $17.95 for adults and $6.95 for kids and includes a made to order omelette bar; however, for Father's Day (and possibly other special occasion holidays) it's $23.95 for everybody and there is no omelette bar. Soft drinks and coffee are also extra by the way. I felt the buffet offerings were very limited compared to other brunch buffets, and the area where it's setup was very crowded and cramped. Minimal vegetarian options -fruit tray, garden salad, seafood salad, pasta salad, breakfast potatoes, scrambled eggs, pancakes and French toast sticks. There was also prime rib, some chicken dish, pork bacon and sausage, and a pastry/dessert section. There were no turkey or vegetarian breakfast meat substitutes. I ended up with pancakes (very dry), fruit, and potatoes. We found out after noticing the made to order omelette bar was missing (which our waitress didn't mention) that we could get omelettes made in the kitchen. They had 3 choices: Denver, Veggie and Seafood. The waitress was clearly unknowledgeable about the items being served, I asked what came in the veggie omelette and she said bell peppers, onions and cheese. I said perfect I'll take that with cheddar cheese. She told my dad the same thing but actually told him it came with cheddar cheese standard. My daughter ordered the seafood (crab, shrimp and tomatoes), hold the tomatoes add cheddar. None of our omelettes had cheddar cheese but came with mozzarella (which I personally can't stand with eggs) and the \"crab\" was actually imitation crab (something important for the server to note I think). Furthermore, the veggie omelettes actually came with red and green peppers (no onions) but also spinach and mushrooms. This was not the combo I'd ordered. Anyway, the server was nice but not a very good waitress in my opinion. For $140 I expect both good service and good food, if you feel the same I would not recommend the Walnut Grill brunch.",

I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised.  My boyfriend and I dropped by prior to a networking charity event that we were attending. Neither one of us was particularly hungry so we just ordered apps. I ordered the Sweet Chili Chicken Lettuce Wraps, which was a rather large dish for an app. It could easily be split between two people. It was so super deliciously yummy. Or yummily delicious, whichever you prefer. :D There was an ample amount of chicken lightly covered in a really great sweet chili sauce along with walnuts, onions, and other things that I forget. You had to put the wrap together yourself, which sort of annoyed me, but they were so good!  Another plus: they randomly had Pumpking! Thank God we got it there that visit because by that weekend it was all gone.  I would chose this location over the others that I have visited because the food was really steps above. Service at all locations has been tremendously pleasant, very good.",

Although they reprinted the menu (it looks like a photo album for a cocktail table) there really aren't that many changes although much to the chagrin of Elyssa they dropped the Tuna Melt. They should add buffalo burgers back on the menu to pick up the overflow from nearby Burgatory, not too many people are willing to wait 2 hours for a burger. It amazes me how they offer $3 draft specials during happy hour you can tell the beer here is alway fresh unlike beer nutz  which seems to never clean their taps. To add bar revenue they should offer the full mixologist specials year round and create a menu just for them.   I consider this my local place to frequent at least 2-3 times per week!",

    "text": "We came for dinner on a rainy and dark Halloween evening. (No, this is not the start of a horror story!)  Given the choice of the patio (which was actually a room inside with large windows) or the dining room, we opted for the quieter dining room.  With 90% of the room empty, we were seated at the booth right next to the kitchen entrance. No big deal and of course we could have asked to be seated somewhere else had it mattered.  She got a vodka mojito which she loved as it was really minty and she's not much of a drinker. The Jamesons I ordered was a generous pour.  We decided on Artichoke and Spinach dip for an appetizer, which came with some tasty sesame seed crackers as well as tortilla chips. The dip was packed with artichokes and we liked it. And it was probably enough for 4 people.  The entree was potato-crusted cod for her and a filet for me. Both came with veggies. I thought the filet was delicious although a little undercooked for medium. And she gave her cod a thumbs-up. The salad I got was fresh and sized just right. I tried creme brulee for dessert and the crust was a little overdone - had a burnt undertone to it. But still I ate it all. We both enjoyed the coffee after the meal, very robust.  Service was a little slow IMO given the small number of patrons at the time but cheerful and polite. But I should mention that sometimes I've been known to think the service is slow when it's just a restaurant's way of not trying to rush people.  Two drinks, two entrees, an appetizer and dessert with coffee came to just under $100 before tip. Would probably go here next time we're in the area as I'm done with the long waits at that burger joint in the same shopping center.",

We kept trying to order drinks, cocktails, coffee, water - it didn't matter - you had to ask at least twice if you really wanted it and even then it would take over 20 minutes to get things. We had a pre-selected menu to choose from and everything from it was fine - the walnut salad was the best thing on the menu, really good. The buffalo chicken wrap was okay.

    "text": "Decided to take my wife (and children) to Walnut Grill (WG) for Mother's Day dinner aanndd as usual, I was not let down. We have eaten at this WG on numerous occasions and have always had good service and a good meal. Now whilst there were one (or THREE) speed bumps, our overall experience was pleasurable. Being the gentleman that I am, let me start with my children. They ordered burgers off of the kiddos menu (that were priced at $5.95)and we'll they got what we paid for. While they were okay the patties were about the size of a flattened out golf ball. They were dwarfed by the size of the bun AND outside of that their meals were fine. My twin T-Rex's devoured them like nobody's business. Now this is were the fun begins. My wife ordered some $19.00 chicken dish (forgive me ladies for not remembering the name) with a baked sweet potato. Well when it arrived the chicken was okay, HOWEVER the baked sweet potato was very cold. So our server (Jason J.) who I want to add was a freakin phenom took it back and brought my wife one that was as hot as Chernobyl in August. Weelll by the time that came back to the table the chicken was so cold it needed a coat. Our waitstaff scooped it up (like the pirates in the World Series trying to hit the cut off man) took it in the back and had the kitchen do their magic. When it returned it appeared to be on life support waiting to have the plug pulled. When my (patient AND good spirited) wife tasted it, it left much to be desired. Again Jason rode in and without a single excuse took the moment from ZERO to HERO!! And did not stop until my wife was sated. And I appreciated that because she was the reason we were there. Did I say Jason J. was a phenom already? Now as for me (the also ran) my meal was great. I had the $18.00 wild mushroom chicken w/the baked sweet potato, a side of cream spinach and water and quite frankly I could not have been happier. By the way did I say that our waiter was a phenom? Everything was hot, moist, succulent, etcetera. I enjoyed it, AND the company of the wife that tolerates me, and the kidZ that love me. To some this up (before it turns into war & peace) we had a great time in a clean establishment with great waitstaff. Oh and lest I forget my kidZ loved the tv in the louvre over the urinals. I had to almost pry them out. In summation I vote with my money and my feet and WG rest assured they will BOTH be back in the near future.",

We found the food to be very average, but that is not the reason for the low star rating.  It was during happy hour and our waitress (Ariana) pointed out the drink specials and prices.  I was uncertain about ordering the sangria after hearing her description but was assured that if I didn't like it that I could order something else.  When she brought our drinks to the table I took a sip and decided that it really wasn't what I was looking for and asked if I could get a glass of house wine listed on the happy hour menu.  She said sure and came back with the wine.  At the end of the meal my husband picked up the tab so I did not have an opportunity to look over the bill.  After returning back to our hotel room I realized that not only were we charged for the sangria but we were charged full price (not the happy hour price) for my glass of wine.  One mistake, maybe, but two, I think not.  This was an attempt to pad the bill in order to receive a larger tip.  I'm guessing that the establishment did not tell her to do this.  If you decide to eat here, be sure to check your bill before paying.  My suggestion, find a place that is more honest with better food!",

All this while making drinks for the rest of the waitstaff...good job!  She said she just got back from vacation and a little out of it but she was still on the ball.  We both had Cucumber Mules and the bartender did a great job on those as well.  They had a nice bite to them and I guess that was the ginger beer.  She had a Carmelized Walnut Salad and a California Turkey Wrap from the Pick a Pair promotion.  The salad was *very* fresh and tasty she said with slightly too much balsamic: 4/5.  The California Turkey Wrap was too dry for her taste.  It would have been better with more honey mustard sauce or guac: 3/5.   I had the Blackened Salmon BLT with fries.  The sandwich was great...perfectly cooked to my liking.  The fries were the battered style and were also delicious:  5/5.  We will definitely be going back.  Total bill was $47.03",

Portions smaller than they should be, attitude when admittedly One of our party became angry because they asked plenty of questions beforehand and still received what we consider a borderline bait and switch.  Small portions weird colored old looking lettuce and portions that would not satisfy a 12 year old let alone a grown person.  Just not up to par, and the bosses were in from St. Louis at the time we were there and we left before costing people their jobs or becoming more upset.  Just not up to the areas standards.  Disappointed to say the least, the part that really made us irked was that instead of fixing the issue the server argued with us, stating that the lettuce is turning brown because it is asian lettuce.  Really thats the best you have?!?!   Anyways what gives walnut grill you guys have the best facilities and cant seem to give people what they want!",

I like the Pittsburgh Salad, for example - traditional greens, plus grilled chicken an some crispy fries.  Service has been spotty.  Some servers seem to have half the restaurant.  You'll get one shot at a drink. Run out and you're out of luck till the check comes!  A disappointment.  Sitting at the bar results in much better service.  But in an area without many traditional, sit-down restaurants, this one is worth a try.  See how your experience goes and post a review of your own.",

It could be rude personalities one time then forgetting the bacon on an item to giving me chicken in a salad instead of steak the next. I don't see the staff write down any orders which I think could attribute to some of the food errors but in general the drinks aren't refilled and the smiles are missing. The atmosphere is the best part, inside and outside are both very nice. I'd recommend sitting outside and keeping your expectations low if you are going to eat here.",

    "text": "What an awful experience - My husband and I rarely go out to eat, but we decided to make a special trip out for our anniversary and let me tell you, I wish we would've just stayed in. Where do I even start...?  We got to the restaurant at around 8PM Our waitress name was Kim (I think??) - She started off by telling us that she is super tired because she's been working all day.... Oh..  Jeeze. Way to make me feel  bad for being here, I apologized to her and began ordering.   The food came out a full 40 minutes after we ordered (there was literally 8 other people in the whole restaurant, so it's not like it was packed) My husband ordered a steak medium well - The meat should be light pink with gray-brown surrounding the center -  it was so extremely obvious that the cook forgot the steak on the grill due to the color of it being completely black - We both kind of laughed when she set the plate down because it felt like a joke. How could someone send this out of the kitchen? It was charred! Like a marshmallow that was on fire. Completely unacceptable. He let the waitress know that it was entirely too overdone and would like them to try again - She talked about how it was \"getting late\" and said \"yeah, the chef here tonight isn't very good\" - What?! Who would say that to people paying money to eat there! The next came out still overdone, but not quite as bad and we didnt even want to say anything about it - I just wanted to leave... The waitress brought the bill to us before asking if we wanted anything else - Trying to redeem the night, my husband said \"actually, may we see a dessert menu? - She seemed so aggravated that we wanted dessert and started talking about how the section we were sitting in shouldnt really have anyone sitting there at this time because she had to prepare for the next mornings buffet and hinted to us that if we were going to stay for dessert that we should move to another section? When I said \"did you want us to move??\" she said \"well.. It would be unprofessional for me to ask you to move... but...\" and just stood there... I was so confused and felt very weird and uncomfortable - She then changed her mind and told us to stay where we were. ok...? We got a chocolate cake to split, which we both hurried through because we felt like she didn't want us there anymore (even though there was still 2 hours until they closed...) We let her know that we were ready for the bill - She set the bill down in front of my husband and as he was getting his card out we started talking about something that happened at work to him that day, he didn't put his card down right away since we were talking she came right back and looked at the bill still on the table and said \"oh, I thought you were ready to leave??\" Both my husband and I just sat there shocked she would say that, I apologized, and I told her that we got into a conversation and she didnt even acknowledge that I spoke, my husband gave her his card and she walked away. I wanted to run out of there crying because we wasted a night out (let alone an anniversary dinner) on this place. I will never go here again, and I have told everyone I know about this since then - It really bothered me and I wanted others to know about is so that they don't waste their hard earned money and precious time.",

That's ridiculous! All we ordered was the lunch combo of soup and salad. How hard is that to make? The area where we sat had multiple empty tables around us, so it's not like the place was packed. Also, the French Onion soup was awful. Super sweet and I could tell it sat around forever before it was served to us because the cheese on top was one big solid mass that was basically inedible. So, in short, my family and I were there for two hours and all we got was half of a caesar salad and some yucky soup. Do yourself a favor and drive to the next plaza and eat at Zoup! That place is awesome, cheaper, and much much faster.",

Honestly, that's no real competition because this place is a notch above that with some of their food creeping over into the very fine dining category.   My only wish is that they offered more seafood options on the menu. Salads here are pretty solid and lunches are quick if you let them know you need to get in and out.   Happy hour here with friends is a bunch of fun regardless of whether you want to drink or not. TVs are well placed in the bar area and you can opt to dine at tables around the bar, in the dining room or outside when the weather is nice.  Definitely worth a visit.",

The calamari was good, not the best I have had but good. They could have been a little more crispy and seasoned, but I would order them again. The Bellini strawtini drink was so good. It was made with champagne and came with a fresh strawberry on the side. Not too sweet which made it perfect. For my main meal I ordered a Caesar salad with salmon. I like food with a little kick to it so I requested the salmon to be cooked blackened which they did with no problem. It was definitely a good Caesar. I would next time get the dressing on the side.

I know that I only have to cross one river to get to the nearest Walnut Grill, but can't they open one up the street from me? :-)!  Me, my family and friends have been to this restaurant many, many times and I can't believe that I have never written a review since it's one of my favorite go-to places.  I think that I have had every single appetizer on the menu, with the exception of the stuffed banana peppers or Seared Tuna Tacos(I just don't like stuffed banana peppers or seared tuna) .  My favorite appetizers are the Pork Dumplings, Fried Pickles and Cheese and Fruit Plate.  You can't go wrong with any of these choices and if you go during their \"Happier Hour\", the prices are reduced to $5 or half.  What's not to like about that?   My favorite go-to dish is the Wild Mushroom Chicken.  Is it a cutting edge dish?  No, but I still love it and I usually add one of their delicious scrumptious crabcakes to go with it. (I hate crabcakes with a lot of fillers and vegegies.  Theirs has neither and \"I die\" for both dishes.  Also not to be missed, if they have any kind of meat shank in season, just order it , eat it, pay for it and go home to recover from a meat coma.  They're just that good.  My daughter usually orders the Buffalo Chicken Wrap or Shaved Prime Rib Sandwich.  Both are delcious and very filling with your choice of a side dish.  For the desserts, you can't go wrong with the Brownie Works or Walnut Turtle Meltaway.  The devil is a liar if you don't think either of these desserts are yummy!",

    "text": "This is a decent place for brunch on the weekend. I went here expecting to order off the menu, but was informed they have a brunch buffet. After looking at the menu, there was nothing that I appealed to me. Most of the items did not sound appetizing or were too expensive, so that left me with brunch.The service was good. The waiter came and and cleaned the plates and refilled our drinks throughout the meal.   The brunch was better than I expected, but not great. They had a carving station with prime rib. The prime rib was very fatty and cooked to a medium rare. Their Greek salad was very fresh. The rice pilaf was hit or miss. One batch was great, very flavorful while another batch was tasteless. Finally the cookies were great while I did not care for the apple cobbler or the brownies. Other items for brunch included - fresh fruit, bacon, sausage, home fries, Eggs Benedict, bass in a curry sauce and chicken parmesan.  Overall it was an okay place for brunch. The items for brunch were either good or okay, nothing was amazing. I feel for $18.00 I could have gone elsewhere for a better meal. I don't think I will come back here.",

Showed up , no one at front station, then hostess came by, made a big deal out of the fact we went from 14 to 15 people, yet the place was empty.  the buffet was sub standard, often empty dishes and pans, fish was dried out, chicken dry, no pancakes and no french toast, both empty.  Noticed alot of workers talking and the hostess texting like mad on her phone.  No one in charge really, just a bunch of kids running the place.  I bet in year or two they will be gone, cannot run a restaurant this way.   Next time we will just do Eat N Park for half the price.",

We had our own wait staff and a menu that was catered to the event.   We were greeted by friendly waiters who took drink orders from us immediately. When it was time to select from our lunch menu, I decided to choose the Parmesan Crusted Chicken & Gnocchi (see photo attached) with a Caesar Salad - both of which are on the restaurants regular menu. The meal was brought out promptly by our servers and was delicious!  I will definitely be back to try the full menu at some point, but for now-I can recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to host a small-medium sized private event as we had a great experience! The worst part about it was having to get in & out of the Waterworks parking lot :)!",

I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt because this went from acceptable service to terrible service. To be fair, when I was here before, I sat in the bar and food was good. I will say on New Years, it was clear no one wanted to work. It took 30 minutes before we even got someone to take our drink order and the restaurant was half empty. We had to practically beg for bread while we waited 45 minutes for our entrees. A couple people wanted another drink but we couldn't find anyone to take our order so I guess we saved money. (We got drinks later at a different bar in the area that was much better.) The food was expensive but definitely wasn't any where near worth the price. The food quality was the level of Eat n Park but four times the price. This experience ruined this restaurant for me and I won't be back.",

I have been here (and the location in Wexford) many of times with both my boyfriend, girlfriends and my family for brunch, lunch, dinner or just wine after work during their Wine Wednesdays (1/2 price bottles HELLO) and have had great service and food every single time!  My first time was for my birthday when I was a freshman in college and their half-baked-gooey-hot-brownie dessert (not sure if they still have it) has left an everlasting imprint in my brain.  This particular location has never been overly packed when I've been here and  that makes it a great place to stop in and grab a bite at any time.  My service has always been excellent and my food has always been great.  Some of my favorites are:  ahi tuna app, spinach and artichoke app, chopped cobb salad, fish tacos, buffalo chicken wrap, and the Sunday buffet (not every item on the buffet is amazing but they do have some pretty good options, IMO)  It's a good place for date night, dinner with a friend or group of friends, brunch with your family or even to stop in and have a drink and dinner alone at the bar!  Interior is modern and always clean.  I really like this place",

I've tried both this location and the Robinson location now and I have to say it just isn't worth your money.  At this particular location I got the french onion soup and the California eggs benedict. The soup was the only good thing I've ever eaten at either location. The eggs benedict was absolutely terrible. Tasted nothing like hollandaise sauce and it was just so bland.  The only reason I feel like I can give it a 2 star is because our waitress was extremely nice. She was the absolute sweetest. Otherwise I would not recommend Walnut Grill to anyone.",

Easily the best news all week!  I ordered a brand new menu item, a harvest bowl with flavorful sauteed garlic mushrooms, asparagus, Roma tomatoes, carrots, almonds and full grain rice. Everything tasted like it was picked minutes before and prepared naturally. This review doesn't do the meal justice. I'm thinking about going back as I'm writing this now!

It's not amazing, it's not outstanding... it doesn't suck, it's just normal, nothing special. I could probably tolerate the food better if it was priced accordingly, but let's be real, they think they're a fine dining establishment with those prices. I could probably justify paying that much if the food was amazing, but it's not.   Secondly, and this is really what drives the 1 star, this place has the worst service of any restaurant in the area. I'm talking about waiting for 10 min to even get approached by a waitress who then gives you attitude, takes your drinks, disappears for another 5 min, drops off drinks and leaves again and doesn't come back for another 10 min. I was dumbfounded on how poor the service was. Food dropped at the table and no check in from the waitress until about 30 min later, at which point were already done. Then she comes by and says \"desert?\". Not \"how was everything, can I get you anything, etc\". Just \"desert?\". We decline, she drops the check on the table and walks away. As in, she already had it printed and ready to go, didn't say a word, just dropped it and walked away.   Overall, staff is rude. That's not the first time I've came across this here. Food is ok. I wouldn't waste another dollar here. Plenty of other places to go to in Fox Chapel and surrounding areas. Honestly surprised they're still in business.",

We decided to give this place a try and went for the spinach and artichoke appetizer which was delicious but there were huge chunks of artichoke which were yummy but I like then chopped a little finer. Now what impressed me was the tuna tacos. It actually had slices of raw seared tuna with an Asian slaw and a sweet soy sauce to compliment the tacos nicely. You get three to an order for 12 bucks which was an awesome price. They were just yummy. My boyfriend got the beef tacos which I did not taste but he said they were perfect and topped with a heaping amount of cheese and mixed veggies.  I would recommend giving this place a try and can't wait to go again.  As for the staff everyone was friendly it did take a while to get a cocktail but it wasn't absurdly long.

    "text": "We went here for lunch on my wife's birthday.  When we first parked outside of the restaurant we saw that they had outdoor sitting and an outdoor bar.  It looked nice.  Luckily it was sunny out and a nice day so we decided to sit outside.    The inside looked nice and it was big but you can't beat sitting outside in the warm weather for lunch.       They let us sit wherever we wanted outside.  You could either sit at the outside bar, you could sit on their high table tops, or they had regular sized tables to sit at as well.  At first we sat on a high top but the table was a little too small for us so we settled for a regular sized table.  The outside area that we were in was covered but they had an uncovered area too in the back.  It was really nice and relaxing outside.  The Sam Adams Oktoberfest was out early so we both ordered the Oktoberfest.         They gave us a lunch menu and a dinner menu.  We were hungry but it was lunch time so we decided to go for the lunch menu.  The lunch menu is basically the dinner menu just with smaller portions.  I ordered the Salmon Balsamico with a side of sweet potatoes fries and my wife got the same thing but she got a side of vegetables and a side salad.  I really liked my salmon.  It had marinated roma tomatoes, goat cheese, basil, balsamic reduction in it.  The sweet potatoes fries look great and some of the fries tasted really good.  The problem was most of them weren't cooked long enough so they were a little hard in the middle.  The fires that were done were excellent.  I decided to take them home and I warmed them up to make them softer and that worked!         My wife had a coupon for her birthday so it was a buy one meal get one free.  You really have to sign up for things like this for your birthday if you don't already.  It really saved us a lot of money for her birthday weekend.  Since she had this coupon they knew it was her birthday so the waitress asked if she would like a free Caramelized Walnut Ball.  My eyes got really big because I knew my wife doesn't eat dessert so this would really be for me!  It was a nice gesture from them to give us a free dessert for her birthday.  I did give my wife a bite or two of the walnut ball but I inhaled the rest of that dessert!       Overall we had a really nice lunch date for my wife's birthday.  We sat around after lunch and had a few more beers to enjoy the weather and each other.  It was great.  If I could go back I would have probably just ordered from the dinner menu to get more food but I was still happy with the portion of my salmon.",

    "text": "For all who are unaware, if you go to Walnut Grill's website and sign up for their mailing list you will receive a coupon for a free dinner or lunch entree for your birthday.  It's a pretty sweet deal so of course I wanted to take advantage of this offer on my birthday.  We went here for a late lunch after seeing a matinee movie at the nearby cinema.  The restaurant has a lovely outdoor seating area, and it was a nice afternoon to eat and drink outside.  For lunch I opted for the Salmon Balsamico.  It came with marinated roma tomatoes, goat cheese, basil, balsamic reduction.  I kind of think goat cheese, or any cheese on a piece of fish is let's say fishy to me so I scraped it off.  My husband got the same thing adding some sweet potato fries and myself a side salad.    Service was pretty good, our waitress was attentive, and we didn't wait long for refills.  Our food came out with a normal wait.  I think my husband liked his salmon more than I liked it.  It was cooked well, just thought it could have been seasoned a little better, and the goat cheese, though scraped off lingered on the fish.  I love goat cheese, just not on expensive fish.  If it has cheese on it, it should only be served at a fast food restaurant where you may make claims that it's not real fish.  Speaking of expensive, I thought their prices were a little high verses their portions.  I hate to kick a gift horse in the mouth, but kind of True.  Nevertheless, we had a very nice afternoon at Walnut Grill and was even given free desert a walnut ice cream ball.  This was much more of a treat for my husband than myself since I believe I had a bite or two and he gobbled the rest of it down.  Very nice touch to end my epic birthday weekend.",

Very unfriendly, could care less if we were sitting there. Never asked my wife if she needed anything. I asked her for another drink. 10 minutes later she asked me if I wanted another drink. I said \" I asked you ten minutes ago for one\" I asked for the check and she pointed to it sitting  behind the  bar. Not even handing it to me. Also, I know a server there. She advised me to never return any food . It could fall on the kitchen floor and end up back on",

I did have to wait 20 minutes for my soup and spent 1 1/2 hours there (food took forever!). Now onto the food.  The French onion soup was eh, the onions a little more undercooked than I cared for and it was typical onion soup, nothing special.  I ordered the horseradish/ potato crusted cod with loaded baked potato.  They brought me a baked potato that seemed to have been sitting for 3 days, the cheese was glued to it and it wasn't that great. They also brought me a fried cod sandwich (wrong) and I had to convince the server that's not what I ordered.  So I sat there and ate the potato.  They did bring my fish and it was again just eh.  The crab \"relish\" was ice cold and the fish had no flavor.  But hey, they did bring me another potato!  All in all disappointing especially with what they charge.  I probably won't be back.",

I ordered the lemon caper fish and it was a disgusting pile of mush drowned in butter. I have never seen fresh fish get that mushy before so it had to have been breaded frozen fish. I got a sweet potato as well that was completely black from being burnt and my snow peas were in a pool of butter. For 17.00 I expected a lot more. Our server did not even acknowledge my remark that my meal was gross. I will never patronize this establishment again.",

Because the dining room was soon closing, we were seated in the bar area at a booth.  We waited at least 10 minutes for someone to come and speak to us at which time we told the server we needed two more place settings of flatware.  When our food came, the waitress placed it on the table and rushed off so fast, we didn't have time to remind her that we still needed two place settings.  We had to sit there letting the food get cold until we could flag down another waiter.  Never during our time there did she offer us drink refills.  Finally one of our party left the table and asked the manager if we could have more drinks.  Several times while we were eating both the waitress and the manager spent time at the table adjacent to ours chatting with the younger people there.  It never occurred to them to turn around and ask, \"Do you need anything?\"  I will never go back there.  Horrible experience.  Oh, and we had to ask for our check too.  Smallest tip I ever gave anyone.",

    "text": "My sisters and I stopped here for a girls lunch out recently. Not being all that hungry, I ordered the lettuce wraps. The first thing I noticed was how very small the portion of chicken was, but since I wasn't that hungry, it wasn't a big deal. I picked up a lettuce leaf and noticed what looked like dirt on it. Picked up a few more and saw the same thing. Wiped some off with my finger and the lettuce below looked fine. This fact will be important later. Our server was called over and told about it. She took the dish into the kitchen and came back with a message from the kitchen staff that I was wrong and what I saw wasn't dirt but was there because the lettuce was wilted. As noted above, it definitely wasn't wilted. I was offered a menu to select another dish (which was the correct thing to do), but was made to feel as though I was unreasonable to complain about the lettuce. The restaurant only had a few tables with patrons so it was not busy at all, but a manager never came over to address the problem. Left hungry and with a resolve to never return. The lettuce wasn't the main problem. I understand things like that happening occasionally. The lack of concern and response from management was the issue, along with being made to feel I did something wrong. If they don't care, how do they expect any of their staff to care.",
