    "text": "I often have lunch at the nearby Point Brugge Cafe, but I decided to give Pino's a try today for a change of pace.  Bad idea.  My lady friend and I started with a pair of appetizers: greens & beans and \"Italian frites.\"  The latter, which the menu described as \"fresh cut, twice cooked, fresh herbs & roasted garlic,\" were basically just regular-ass french fries - decent, but nowhere near worth their $6 price tag.  The greens and beans were even more of a rip-off: 8 FREAKIN' DOLLARS for a smallish bowl of rather flavorless produce.  Talk about a profit margin!  As a main course we shared a flatbread with goat cheese, caramelized onions, and roasted red pepper.  It was pretty good, but my enjoyment was diminished by the FM radio that was blaring through the loudspeakers.  Who wants to hear car commercials while eating a meal at a \"nice\" restaurant?  Classless.  Conclusion: I'd rather wait 45 minutes for a table at Point Brugge than be seated immediately at Pino's.",

We made the 7:00 reservations only 2 days in advance and the place was about half full when we got there and very full by 8:00 with some folks eating at the bar. We were seated within minutes at a great table near the front window. It was nice and private so we could talk with our friends. Water and bread was on the table within minutes with drinks shortly behind. we ordered the beans and green and italian fries as appetizers, The beans and greens were good but I've had better, The italian fries, which seemed to be fries with flash fried kale and garlic with a pesto mayo were unbelievably good. I had the Del Sol pasta and it was very flavorful, though a little salty. The chicken was very moist and the sauce was very good. My husband had the cacciatore special and said the chicken was very good but they sauce could have been a bit more flavorful. The service was very good the entire night, I would like to go back, and try the pizza or flat bread.",

However, after coming home from brunch, the experience was enough to not only completely change my mind, but to keep me coming back.  My boyfriend had the scallops and I have the pino benedict (eggs benedict, of course).  My boyfriend literally looked like he was having a religious experience with the scallops.  His eyes were closed, he was moaning, and it took him about 25 minutes to eat 3 scallops.  He said it was the first time in his life that he ever wanted to take so much time to chew his food. My dish was delicious and the in-house made bread was fresh and savory.    Overall, I am very pleased with the lunch menu and the range of dishes that are available.  We'll definitely be back for brunch.",

The brunch was very good, I enjoyed the atmosphere, particularly the \"missing\" wall which gives the appearance of outdoor seating, and particularly liked not having to sit shoulder-to-shoulder with other people.  My sole comment would be that the owner, who was very friendly, should let his food speak for itself rather than being so concerned about the neighborhood competition.",

In all honesty, we haven't been back for a year though we kept saying \" we have to get to Pinos!\" Needless to say, we were disappointed.  The place has changed and not for the better.  It seems in an effort to create a quaint wine bar, Pinos lost sight of the original draw and that was the food.  The menu has been scaled back considerably.  Though the food was adequate, it's not the same.  I came here because the food was amazing and with that no longer being the case, I doubt we will return.  Hopefully, things will change back to how they were.  Customer advice for what it's worth.  Refocus on great italian food not a wine bar concept.   Sometimes a liquor license is not the best investment!!!",

We were seated almost immediately on the lovely outdoor patio area. It was a great night to be outside. Although the restuarant is small, the ambiance is wonderful. I could tell thet the guests around me were enjoying themselves as well.  The table decided to order the 3 course menu for 30$ because of the large amount of options. We each decided on a different entree so that we were able to share and get a good idea of all the restaurant has to offer. I started off with a mixed green salad with grileld pears, walnuts and goat cheese. The pears had a nice smokeyness about them that complimented the sweet vinagarette. For my entree, I chose the Arrabiata with rigatoni. The dish was very good but much more spicy than I had expected. I feel that they should have informed me of this or explained the spice level on the menu. Luckily, I enjoy spicy food but I was unable to finish the entree due to the spice level. It was slightly less spicy when I finished it for lunch the next day. My husband had the veal and risotto which he loved. For dessert, I orderedthe peach mille feuille. The portion size was enormous and the peaches were ripe and tasty. However, the marscapone filling hardly tasted of marscapone. I had the opportunity to try my husband's white chocolate tiramisu and was pleasantly surprised by the light but still rich flavors. Our dinner guests also seemed to enjoy their choices as well.   Overall, I would definitely recommend Pino's for a nice, romantic date night out in Point Breeze. However, I wish they offered the 3 course menu as a regular feature.",

The flatbread pizza I shared with a friend was very yummy. The True colors came out at dinner.   The service was TERRIBLE. There were three servers for the entire restaurant, which was insufficient. And the food took forever. We ordered a roasted vegetable platter appetizer, which was delish. After that, it all went down hill. Two of us ordered salads and one ordered a pasta dish. It took an inordinately long time for three simple (and mostly cold) meals to arrive. The salads were fair at best. It was a lot of lettuce and not much else.   We are not planning to return any time soon. We actually ended up there only because there was a wait at the (significantly better) Point Brugge down the block. In retrospect, we should have spent our time waiting there for better food and better service than for what we ended up with a Pino's.",

Had the beans and greens and they were bland.  Could have used some red pepper flakes or other spice to kick them up a notch.  Salads were boring.  Just basic lettuce and tomato.  I had the acorn squash ravioli and it was too sweet to eat a whole plate full.  My husband had the cod and commented on the lack of flavor.  Our friends were not pleased with their food either.  Rude and slow service.   Wine prices were very high.  Over all disappointing for the price.",

Verdict? It was so-so. We had reservations at 7:15 and were seated promptly, which was fine, except we were seated OUTSIDE! Listen folks, it's COLD when the sun goes down. They have three tables set outside, I guess trying to squeeze out some more business. Our server was nice, but not attentive at all.  We were left waiting for things for 10-20 minutes at a time. Also, because we were sitting on the sidewalk, people and animals and cars kept sweeping by us. It took the waiter three tries to get our meal order because he had to keep stepping out of the way of people walking down the street. Wine was good. Food was ehhhhhh. We had the mussel and clam appetizer and when it came out, about 1/2 of the order was not edible and all the innards had fallen into the sauce, which by the way smelled like stinky cheese. My dinner and my husbands dinner was good, no real complaints there. Espresso and a S'more cupcake for dessert and I grand total of $134 later before tip? Definitely not worth it at all.  The best part of the night? Leaving. The worst part of the night? Associating this place with my anniversary.",

The food is generally OK and even tasty, but the service is consistently poor.  A worm in the broccoli and no offer to take it off the bill.  Three pizzas arriving when we had ordered two and the server insisting - insisting!  that we had ordered three.  Once we arrived when the restaurant was full (others have noted that it rarely is) and when we asked if they could seat us the hostess looked at us blankly and just said \"no\" - no \"I'm so sorry,\" or \"it will be about a 20 minute wait\" - just \"no.\"  The other day someone came up and adjusted the picture on the wall behind us - hung in a place where anyone's head could bump it - and said \"don't touch the pictures, they're very expensive.\"  Well, welcome to Pino's!  Pino's has had a number of makeovers in the last few years and it is lovely, but hasn't figured out the basic point that if you want to have a popular neighborhood restaurant, you actually have to be nice to the neighbors.  I'll take an hourlong wait at Point Brugge any day - a nice excuse for a stroll around the block.",

It was a relatively nice evening, and I thought the concept of fresh-air dining was too good to pass us by. We were immediately greeted by Jen, one of the co-owners, as we entered. I made it a point to compliment the beautiful inlaid tile in our tabletop, and she volunteered some additional information about their production that I found to be very interesting.   I really loved the bistro burger. I requested it to be prepared \"Medium\", and sure enough it lived up to my expectations---you'd be surprised how many times I've ordered a medium burger only to have it served well-done and nearly bone-dry at other restaurants. Nicole, our waitress, proved her weight in gold when she reassured me that gorgonzola would be a good cheese to accompany the bacon on the burger. We also ordered the macaroni & cheese as an appetizer. I thought the ziti was a bit dry, but the sauce and cheese were delicious. We really loved the bread and the garlic butter spread. I was hoping for an oil & vinegar blend to have with the bread, but the spread served as a surprisingly tasty alternative. My partner's ravioli looked delicious, and he let me try one of his meatballs, which I found to have that \"homemade\" flavor that's difficult to find at many restaurants. Our friend loved her arugula salad, and as a seafood aficionado I was impressed by the very generous size of the shrimp she had. Our service was prompt---our water glasses had barely gone half-empty before our waitress scurried over to replenish them.   Overall we loved our experience and WILL be back! We were told about Pino's legendary Sunday brunches, and I look forward to trying one myself the next Sunday I have off from work.",

I've just been back for the first time in 6 years after moving away, and was pretty unimpressed... The decor looks nice, but the food was wayyyyy overpriced for what it was. $22 dollars for a plate of pasta, really? It claimed to be \"fresh pasta,\" but it was completely tough and chewy (not \"al dente,\" just undercooked), and not very large. I'm not sure when the restaurant changed, but I think it really missed the mark... People WANT a casual, friendly, affordable neighborhood place that they can bring the kids to. Why take that away?",

After my visit last night, I have no desire to ever go again.   I don't know the owner, Joe, personally but he has stopped by our table a few times and said \"dish looks beautiful.\" He was always confident in his food which I guess is a good thing if the good is delicious,  which it usually is    The table next to ours had a two women, a mother and daughter. The mother asked the server for a new steak as hers was a bit salty (I've never had the steak as I'm vegetarian but my guests have mentioned the abundance of salt). The server apologizes and returns to the kitchen. The owner comes out and fakes an apology claiming his steaks are perfect. At this point the whole restaurant is listening it's that crazy.  The  best part? He comes out again and says \"I really enjoyed the steak you sent back.\" He was eating the steak and had some in his mouth! I can't make stuff like this up! At this point the whole place feels bad for the mother and daughter. Clearly an awkward situation. The owner got so nasty the daughter tried to reason with him and he said \"it's not my job to make people happy\" that's strange considering he wants our business.  So the mother tries to pay the bill with a $100 and leave but he said they can't make change. Eventually another customer helps make change and they leave.  I couldn't finish my dinner I was so mad.  Maybe Joe was having a bad day but there is no excuse for how he treated those customers.  Sorry, we will never step foot in here again.",

Salad was average at best.  The beets tasted like canned beets and the chicken was covered with blackish oil from a burnt oil pan.    Then, to make matters worse the chef came out to argue with a patron who returned her food.  The chef came out to humiliate the customer explaining that her returned steak was great and himself was enjoying it.  Eating food from a customers plate was a real turn-off....what else does he do when cooking?   To make matters worse, when paying the bill, the chef did not have change for a $100 bill for the customer who returned her steak..  It was very uncomfortable watching the elderly customer and her young friend deal with the situation. He kept  loudly requesting a credit card  and the women did not have one.   Another customer provided them with change as the chef crumbled the check. I think I would have just left and not paid....give the lady great for dealing with such a lunatic.

My partner called ahead at around five pm and made a reservation for eight o'clock. Arriving on time we were left standing at the hostess stand for nearly fifteen minutes before someone came to seat us. While waiting the female bartender asked if there was anything we would like from the bar. We decided on two light beers.    The server was nice, however we waited for at least ten minutes for the bread plate to come out, and awhile longer for the calamari, salad and finally the main course. My partners' plate had to be sent back due to it being practically raw, when he requested well done.     After nearly two hours ( 1:40min) we were more than finished and eager to go home. On the way out the bar tender called out in a husky voice \"sir, you forgot to pay your beer tab.\" The service was slow and not very hospitable. The plate, the steak was delicious. Unfortunately my partners was less than mediocre.     Unfortunately we will not return to Pino any time soon due to our experience. If you decide to try Pino then I suggest arriving ten minutes late and eat an appetizer before you get there....",

    "text": "The fresh-baked bread and sun-dried tomato puree is outstanding. We started with the crab cakes, which was one of the lightest I've had. I could eat a vat of the lemon aioli itself. We followed with veal and ricotta meatballs that were perfectly cooked. We finished with their Italian fries. I would order these every single time now that I've had them once. Twice cooked, herbs, garlic confit, basil aioli--every single element of the dish is fantastic.  If you plan on visiting, then make sure you have some time to really take in the drink list and menu. There are always a handful of new, recommended wines to try and a signature cocktail of the week (which, might I add, is usually extremely fun and concocted with unique ingredients). I am impressed with the cleanliness, decor, and ambiance of the restaurant. I love the feel when the French doors are completely open.   I also enjoyed our bartender, Eamonn, who was funny, polite, and attentive. He is also a master of not only creating fresh, new, tasty cocktails but, simply, understands the right way to mix and serve a drink.  Overall, I would love to keep Pino's as our little secret but would urge you to try it too!",

I find that we are well served, not rushed and the noise level is not too loud at lunch We have several times asked the Chef to make us some special version of his menu and we are always accommodated. To me this is excellent service. Makes you feel like coming back. I would have to admit that I usually order the garlic fries which are really great. I do this if I am not going back to the office or out to meet a client. Normally I would add a soup of the day which are always nice, and a sandwich of the day.  I have never been disappointed and certainly would continue to conduct business lunches here. Pino's has been very reliable and dependable in all aspects.  I would make it 3 1/2 stars.",

    "text": "BEFORE Pino's was renovated, it was a tiny, unpretentious, hole-in-the-wall restaurant with a friendly atmosphere, and amazing Italian food. It was also a BYOB, which I love. This was our \"go-to\" restaurant.  AFTER Pino's was renovated, there was a complete transformation. While the interior is now very nice, It's no longer a BYOB, and the staff is full of attitude, which seems to stem from the total arrogance of Pino himself.  On our most recent visit, we were a party of four with reservations at 7:30 PM. We arrived at 7:25, and weren't even acknowledged until 7:40 PM. Pino was playing maitre d', and when he finally acknowledged our presence he seemed totally clueless and was overtly UN-apologetic. There were no open tables, despite having reservations. When 8:00 PM rolled around, I was frantically calling other local restaurants to see if we could get in. No such luck, since it was prime dining time on Saturday night. Finally, around 8:30 PM, the waitstaff brought a two person table up from the basement, crowded four chairs around it and jammed it into the middle of the restaurant for us to sit in. Pino then literally threw our menu's at us, and walked away. Not so much as a free drink for our inconvenience.  The food is still good here, but I refuse to give my money to someone who CLEARLY does not appreciate your business. There are SO many good restaurants in the area, with owners/chefs who are happy to have you. Next time you think about going here, walk an extra block to the Point Brugge Cafe.",

    "text": "I ate here this past Friday with my girlfriend and two other dining companions.  We decided to come here because it was Pittsburgh restaurant week and they offered a special 3 course $30 fixed price menu with 2 course wine pairing for $12.  It ended up being a small little restaurant in the middle of Point Breeze which I had been past many times previously but never really noticed.  The restaurant was swamped whenever we got there, probably due to a combination of it being Friday night and restaurant week, so thankfully we had made reservations and were seated almost immediately.  I decided to start off my meal with a salad while my girlfriend had the tomato garlic bisque.  My salad was good and came with goat cheese, pears and a vinaigrette which all tasted nicely.  It was nothing amazing but I think it takes a really special salad to be amazing.  I also tried my girlfriends bisque and unsurprisingly found it to be a bit tomato-y since I do not enjoy tomatoes very much but she really enjoyed it.  For my entree I decided to get two small plates instead of a larger entree and settled on the mac n cheese and fish tacos.  The tacos were a bit sloppy/wet but had some nice flavors (cilantro, aoili and pico) in them along with some chili sauce that gave it a nice little kick.  My mac n cheese came out in its own little cast iron type pot and was good.  There was an adequate amount of cheese throughout and I liked that they even had some ricotta buried inside the dish.  I was also able to try the Arrabbita that one of our dining companions had ordered.  Wow was it good and it packed quite the spicy punch too.  Immediately I regretted not ordering it although I still did enjoy my two small plates.  For my dessert course I ended up having the White Chocolate Creme Brulee.  My girlfriend decided upon the tiramisu while another at our table had the peaches and puff pastry.  All of the desserts seemed large and made sure that we did not go home hungry!  My creme brulee tasted decently and ended up being a good finish to my meal.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  Their regular menu seemed reasonably priced and everything that I had tried throughout the night was good.",

    "text": "My two friends and I had a bad experience here.  Short version: despite legitimate out-of-state identification, my two friends and I were denied service by the owner who acted inappropriately and very unprofessional. Offended; will not be returning.  Longer version: While we were waiting for our table at a busy nearby restaurant to free up, we wandered over to Pino's and thought we'd sit for a glass of wine. We were welcomed in, and we took a seat at the bar. The three of us are recent college graduates, and we presented our out-of-state ID's to the bartender. The bartender examined mine closely, and then took it across to the other side of the bar and handed it to a group of people sitting and drinking wine. I was confused, but shrugged it off as I settled in.  The group passed my I.d. among them and were chatting gaily. The bartender returned to me a moment later and told me that \"she\" [one of the ladies among the group] wanted to talk to me. I imagined the owner had to be among them, and I good-naturedly approached the group. We made some jokes about my young age, and it went on like this until my friends came over to join the discussion.   We eventually identified (who I believe was) the owner among the crowd, who communicated to us that she would be held responsible were anything to happen to us or anyone around us within so many hours after we were served, etc. We realized (not that the owner ever told us this explicitly) that we were being denied service, despite being 24 year old adults with legitimate identification. My friends and I were offended, and we left shaken (not that we would let any of that ruin our night).  To be denied service, I understand; but I am very disappointed in how the owner handled the situation: First, she had no business passing my ID among her friends. If she wished to deny me service, rather than have me come to her across the bar, she would have been more professional to have come to me, identify herself as the owner, and discuss privately her concerns about serving out of state IDs. Second, instead of going on about why she was so uncomfortable with the situation I was putting her in, she should have told me explicitly and in a forward manner than she was choosing to refuse me service.  Finally, her refusal to serve me displays clearly that she is not interested in my business - for I am sure that it is not difficult for a business owner to get a hold of a book of state ID's (with identifying characteristics by year etc.).  I will not be returning.",

Two of us were there early and rudely treated by the hostess. She was vague about seating us and we decided to wait at the bar. When the rest of our group arrived (on time!!), I informed the hostess and she looked at me blankly and then the packed restaurant.  She told me it would be awhile. Huh? When asked what \"awhile\" was, she said 20min.  But then seated us in 5 (she had to bus a table which I take it as one of the things she dislikes about her job - that and people).  Food was a let down. Potato latkes were greasy and blah.  Fish tacos were recommended and were basically fried fish sticks.  Pumpkin risotta was heavy and confusing flavor wise.  Others had the same sentiments.  Service was rough.  Long waits and lack of attentiveness. Noise level (couldn't converse at all) made the night just a bit harer to tolerate. Not sure Pino's will get a repeat visit.  Disappointment:(",

I guess I should have read the reviews on here before going, seeing as a lot of people echo the sentiments that I feel.  After my mother sent back her extremely oversalted steak, the chef came out to \"apologize\". It was very embarrassing how he chastised her for not enjoying her meal. He then snidely commented, as walking away, that he would \"never salt his steak again\". I don't really take kindly to people speaking so rudely to my mother. She was very polite about sending it back and certainly didn't deserve any attitude. We had an event to attend, which we were very clear with to our waitress. So when my mother reordered another meal (a salad), which took another twenty minutes, my mom asked for it to be immediately wrapped up. The chef returned, obviously chewing to make a point, and sneered at my mother, announcing her steak that she refused to eat was actually quiet good. Well, I have never felt more embarrassed in a situation. I said he was being rude to my mother, a paying customer. He proceeded to get heated and tell me it was not his job to make people happy (!??!) and that everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal and we just had to get to the inside of the steak to appreciate it.   The drama continued when he did not have change for $100 for a $57 bill. Sorry, how can you not have $33 in change?! He ended the night by throwing our bill in a crumbled mess on the floor and walking out.   Overall, embarrassing. It was an embarrassing situation for anyone to witness. Take heed of the negative comments on this site. I certainly wish I would have.",

The prices in the high $20's for most of the entrees are not justified by the quality, location, or portions.  The food is essentially slightly hipper Olive Garden fare at double the prices.  For dinner entrees you can get more for your money elsewhere.  But it's not all bad.  The atmosphere is pleasant and the service was excellent.  I had a good time and I'd happily go back for appetizers (most are $8-10).  Pino's is frequented by a large rambunctious flock of malbec massacring 40-50 year old women.

We chose an option for each course of  the very limited Restaurant Week menu. I selected the baked eggplant caprese appetizer, Lazy Man lasagna Florentine and then the panna cotta for dessert.   Baked eggplant caprese: the breaded eggplant was a soggy mess.  Lazy Man Lasagna Florentine: it was essentially two huge lasagna noodles sandwiching huge clumps of spinach (I'm talking like a 3-inch high pile of clumped spinach) with a few mushrooms peppered in. The spinach ratio was out of control and I honestly ate a few bites and couldn't even continue.  Panna cotta: this was the most decent of the items we ordered.  My friend ordered off the regular menu, which she advised not to do since her food would come out at a different time?? Why?  We tried my friend's appetizer of the Italian Fries, which are described on the menu as sounding very similar to the amazing fries at Point Brugge...but it was just a bowl of regular French fries, which were lackluster and misleading. She also got the house soup with chickpeas and it looked like Spaghetti-o's and tasted even worse.  I don't know where all the positive reviews are coming from. There was not one thing we ate that was impressive in any way. All of it was overpriced and below mediocre. I wasted my money, and I will never, ever go back there.",

The hostess loudly complained as we were walking out about other people who had left because they didn't have tables available, and about us \"finally\" leaving (she even ran out onto the street to try and track the people down). It couldn't have been more than *5 minutes* from the time we paid the check until the time we left. I've never experienced such inhospitality at an otherwise friendly neighborhood restaurant. I hope they improve their attitude towards diners, because otherwise, it would have been a 4 or 5-star experience.",

    "text": "I went to Pino's to celebrate a friends birthday on a Thursday night.  I hadn't been in Pino's since they renovated, but I have to say that they made the interior beautiful.  We made reservations, but I don't think we would have needed them since there was just a few other parties seated when we came in.    My two girlfriends and I always have a tough time deciding what to order...so naturally we order one of everything that looks good.  We started with the Charcuterie platter, which was a mix of absolutely delicious prosciutto, capicola, and soppressata with a bit of veggies and mozzarella.  This was an impressive way to start out the meal.  We all wanted to try the seasonal ravioli, which was pumpkin (too tempting for three certified pumpkin fanatics), so we got an order to share as an appetizer.  This was unlike other pumpkin ravioli I've had...very pumpkiny.  The ravioli was good, although we all agreed that we wouldn't have been able to eat a whole order.  It was very sweetly spiced and I was missing a little bit of savory with the dish.    I ordered the grilled sausage pizza for my entree, and was pleased with it.  I admittedly never get too excited about pizza, and this was good, but nothing that I was dreaming about later that night.  Overall, the food was a 3-4 for me.    The service was outstanding.  Our waiter was very welcoming and knowledgable.  My friends got dessert, and when the chef (I assume Chef Pino?) came over to ask how it was, my friend jokingly said that it was delicious, but would be perfect with a bit of sauce.  Before she could take another bite, he whisked both of the desserts away and added fresh strawberries and sauce, saying that he would be serving the dish that way for now on.  Talk about service!  The whole experience was fantastic, service gets a 5.    Added bonus:  Awesome beer selection, some brews I haven't seen.  Only place I've been that had East End Homewood Reserve on tap for me to try (exciting for a beer dork like me, and it is tasty, by the way).",

We seemed to have 2 waitresses, both acting like they were only helping the other out occasionally, neither of them actually our dedicated waitress.  I ordered the broccoli soup, which came cold. Then sat in front of me for 15 minutes before someone came to check on us.  Finally the waitress came and asked me about it and I told her I didn't not want it warmed up as it now seemed unappetizing to me from trying to eat it cold.  (This is what ruined the night) she snapped it off the table and walked away from us without a word.  I was left feeling embarrassed that I did something wrong? She would not make eye contact with us the rest of the meal.  30 plus minutes later our dinner came out, pizza and pasta which was very good, and hot.  We were offered a 25 dollar gift card before leaving because obviously the owner knew something was up. We may go back again being that the food was good. But the service turned me off big time",

Having walked, we didn't have many other options, so we headed into Pino's (albeit a tad underdressed).  The food was all pretty good--one of my companions had the chicken and risotto, and the chicken was tasty but the risotto was creamy only from the addition of fat, and not from released starches...I had the casareccia as arrabiata is my favorite sauce.  The pasta itself was tasty (and homemade as the name implies), but the sauce lacked the signature spice of arrabiata. For $25 for a bowl of pasta, I expect much, much more.  Bottom line--you won't be disappointed by the food, but when the check comes, you'll feel you have overpaid. Ambiance does not match the prices, but the happy hour deal (half off wine) might be worthwhile.",

Our waitress was good, but that couldn't save the food.  The meal started out with some what I guess used to be foccacia.  I say used to be because it no longer represented anything other than long pieces of brick or bark very stale and tasteless.  We ordered the vegetable board which was probably the best thing we ordered with light and bright vegetables perfectly cooked and paired with two delicious sauces.   Then we ordered the octopus which was fine, but very cold and the octopus had little to no flavor, being overwhelmed by the citrus in the dish.   The tuscan wings were ok, but they were really ordered for my husband who seemed to enjoy them.   Finally the diver scallops.  This dish was indeible.  The scallops were very overcooked and the pea puree was so minty I was unable to eat it. We sent it back and they did take off half of the price (weren't expecting anything just didn't want to eat it).   After that we decided against dessert and left.  I probably will not return.",

Every restaurant can have a bad day. And even the worst places can please some customers every now and then.   What you get at Pino's is great service and excellent food. If your idea of Italian is the Olive Garden, you are in for an education and a treat. This is the real deal. We have a family of picky eaters including a full blown celiac and we all love it.  Yes, over the years I have twice seen owner/chef Joe unhappy with unhappy customers. In one case the customer was arrogant and offensive. On the other occasion, Joe should have swallowed his pride if only to avoid the coordinated revenge reviews that followed.",

The Shirley temple was okay, the cherries tasted like water, but overall can't complain about the food. The service is where I have an issue with this restaurant and the sole reason why I won't be returning. When we first sat, our server seemed nice. I asked how large the pasta servings were, and she said \"you're skinny, so it'll be too much for you.\" This was... rude to say the least. I am not a 00, but it didn't seem necessary to make a comment like that when I just wanted to know how much pasta I was getting.  Secondly, I ordered my soup along with my drink. Other people in my party ordered the calamari, and got it almost right away. I kept thinking my soup would be coming, but when they brought out the main dishes, I asked the server. She just said, \"my mistake. I'll bring it.\" And was gone. After everyone at my table had finished the meal, my soup was brought out with no apology whatsoever. At the end of the meal, I saw that I was charged in full for my soup, which was still billed as an appetizer. I found this weird, because I thought it would have been appropriate for the server (or manager!) to offer a discount or for the soup to be on the house. So, I decided to ask if i could get some money off. The waitress gave me the dirtiest look and said \"well... you ate it.\" No, I inhaled it after it was extremely late. So she said \"I mean, I could take off like... a dollar or two. But it's only a dollar so...\" I said, \"so you can't?\" And she said, \"well, it'll be a dollar or two.\" So I said thank you, and she returned the new check and made sure to make a scene and announce to my entire table that we were receiving a new check. Also, I heard her talking about my party on the phone; she seemed to be complaining about the size of our party and wasn't sure how we were going to be paying, when she easily could have asked us how we were paying. Overall, great food, and it seemed that most people reviewing didn't have such a bad experience with the service.",

    "text": "OK.  As you can see, I gave Pino's a Four Star review. Also, please notice that this is a two part review. Part One: Last night was my first night at Pino's.  The interior is warm and inviting and a seat by the windows was great.  We got there when they just opened so there was still some prep work going on and for me that's just fine.  Ordered a Makers Mark Manhattan and I have to say that it was one of a very few that ranked as excellent!  The only problem was that the cherry was stemless and had a pit, which, for my dining companion, was a BIG surprise.  The bread and  Sundried Tomato spread was excellent. For Starters, I had the evening special Chicken Liver Mousse which was presented on French toast rounds and accompanied by a pickled slaw with dried cherries.  It was very pleasant and a good choice.  For an Entree I chose the Braised Beef Sugo, which was a portion of numerous slices of braised beef served over linguini and covered with the braising liquid. All of the pastas were fresh and made in house. The beef was pull apart tender, but very under-salted.  There were also no salt or pepper shakers to be seen and also no ground pepper offered by the server.  I would have liked the chance to season my meal to my taste...not the chefs. For dessert, I had the chocolate mousse with berries.  The mousse was a textural surprise for me.  Instead of light and fluffy, it was more of an ice cream consistency.  Very low on sweetness but all the same very enjoyable.  Now, Part Two:  If you're going to serve pasta dishes for $25.00 plus, You need to re-appraise your status and classification.  The restaurant tends to lean more towards upscale but at a better, affordable price point.  The interior is attractive, there are linens on the tables, the candles were very clever with the flame surrounded by coffee beans and the service was very good.   Things that I think should be considered are: -New choice of cherries for bar drinks.  Hopefully w/o pits, or at least a verbal warning from the server. -Salt and pepper shakers on the tables.  Swallow your pride.  Not every meal is going to be placed in front of someone sharing your same taste buds. -Coffee.  The coffee was great.  Usually I take cream and sugar but I was able to drink this coffee black just like a grown-up. -Cream.  Really?  Little plastic creamers?  Really?  You're selling noodles for $25.00 and you can't present the coffee course with a bit more panache?  Spring for some inexpensive metal creamers and perhaps present it with the sugars on a small tray with the beverage. - The Disco Menu Board.  What is usually reserved to announce the nightly Beer, Wing and Rib Platter is used here to tell, I don't know who, about tonight's specials.  All painstakingly hand written by an employee who possesses excellent calligraphic skills.  All, of course, done in vivid day-glo colors which screams at you when the black light is turned on. Why not try a simple frame with easy rear access to just hang a copy of the specials with a title of ...maybe...Tonight's Selections.  Keep a few spaced out on the bar for any patrons having a pre-dinner cocktail. If you insist on keeping this Twentieth Century example of advanced technology, then why not mount one of those singing fish right above it.  I really did enjoy my experience at Pino's, but I think you reached your goal a while back but kept over doing and adding to an already spot on formula.",

Two of us ordered the lobster and shrimp, while the other ordered the chicken del sol but with shrimp (the kitchen had run out of chicken, so the chef came out and made that suggestion). All 3 entrees were delicious. Our server Mary was very sweet and continued to talk to us even after we had paid our bill. The chef was also very attentive. Can't wait to return after I move to Pittsburgh!",

For the salad, I liked that they went with mozzarella balls rather than a slice.  The homemade pasta is awesome. We had the bolognese and the arrabbiata. The sauce was thick and flavorful. The arrabbiata was truly spicy. I've found most Pittsburgh restaurants make a very mild arrabbiata. This had a nice heat level.",

    "text": "Pino's is an mid-level Italian place with a charming neighborhood atmosphere. The prices aren't the cheapest, but for what it is Pino's delivers small plates and dinners that are satisfying without breaking the bank. The lamb bolognese is one of my personal favorites, as well as pretty much any of the appetizers. I also love the creative cocktail list and the half price bottles of wine for happy hour. There are few places in Pittsburgh that can get me as excited about cocktails as Pino's. My roommate and I have come here with friends and sat at the bar for hours eating and drinking a variety of delightful things. In short, they do drinks and food quite well for the price.   The reason Pino's only gets three stars is the unfortunate inconsistency with service I've encountered. I get treated differently depending on who I come in with, and that's unprofessional. If I'm with my roommate and one of my friends (both of whom work nearby) we all get seated quickly and treated extremely well. In short, it feels like my presence is valued. When I've come to Pino's with people who aren't in with the owners though, I've had a thoroughly lackluster experience. Once I came on my birthday with my boyfriend and frankly was let down. We waited awkwardly for a very long time to be seated even though there were empty tables and in general had a very impersonal experience. I felt embarrassed having spoken so highly of Pino's to him beforehand. I know I'll be back for the occasional happy hour or small dinner, but Pino's isn't somewhere I would take anyone I wanted to impress due to the problematic service.",

In the summer there is also patio seating.  The servers we have all had have been polite and friendly and willing to make recommendations if asked. No issues with timeliness of food or drink! Everything came out as expected.   We were particularly blown away by the cheese board. We could have ordered two of those for our meal!

With an already limited menu, this was frustrating.  The last two times it was the cheese plate.  This was a real bummer, as my wife and I loved their cheese plate the first time we came here.  The last time they were also not making their pizzas which makes up almost a quarter of the menu.    On my last trip here I ordered the surf and turf off of the Valentine's Day menu.  For the price, the dish was very underwhelming.  For what they were charging I was expecting a high quality, properly cooked piece of meat and a lot of juicy crab stuffed lobster tail.  Instead, my plate just looked empty and sad.  The meat was overcooked and the lobster tail only had about 5 bites I could take before it was gone.  Still a great place, but I hope they get back to being extraordinary like the first time I came here.",

I wrote a detailed account of that evening but it appears as though the owner has somehow made it disappear.  In a nutshell, I was served a dish that was not what I ordered.  When I pointed that out, the server said that she would see if it was possible for me to receive what I ordered.  She returned and said it was not.  The owner came out - we did not request to see him - and began his verbal attack and threats.  He stood at the table as we stared in amazement telling us he didn't want people like us in the restaurant.  He left the table and returned to kitchen then came back multiple times escalating with each return.  His comments included, \"I don't like you people\", \"I'm calling the police\", \"You're dismissed from the restaurant\", and finally \"Get out\".  He grabbed my wife's plate of uneaten food and said she didn't deserve to eat.  We are in our 60's, have professional work and we're simply out for a pleasant evening.  We were horrified and I made a police report when I returned home.  This behavior is unacceptable and potential customers need to be aware of this hateful environment.",

The carbonara sauce was not think or creamy at all. The pasta was good & there were good flavors in that. My husband's regular spaghetti & meatballs was just okay. The marinara was missing something... maybe salt or pepper? There was no flavor to it. The dessert was good. It was a chefs feature of mascarpone whipped cream inside two pastries with fresh fruit. That was good. All in all, it was just okay. I want to love this place.",

Overhearing the owner, I can concur that he did tell the 2 women that they were: \"mean and rude \" and he didn't want them in his restaurant 'dismissing' them from his restaurant.  That is fact.  He did in fact rip a plate away from the one woman who was still eating.  The owner WAS out of control.  He escalated the situation over a noodle.  I felt bad for both ladies.  No one should be treated the way the owner treated them.  After this display, My family and I won't go back to Pino's.   Too bad Joe, we were good customers.",

People are nice and the service was fine but the food isn't cheap and out of a group of 5 people, I can't say anything that was ordered was good. It really all seemed kinda meh and not anything I'd re-order or come back for. Hope they are able to make some changes because it seems like it has a lot of potential.",

    "text": "I really fell in love with this restaurant immediately when I walked in. It is located in a cute neighborhood in squirrel hill, and the environment of the restaurant was very warm and inviting. I came here for restaurant week and got the shrimp bisque for an appetizer, pasta bolognese for entree,  and tiramisu for dessert. The soup was a great presentation and was very good. The shrimp was cooked to perfection. The pasta bolognese was also delicious and you can tell it was made from scratch. The tiramisu was a good size and did not disappoint. It is a little on the pricey side but well worth the money. The only complaint I had was the waiter took a little too long introducing the items on the menu and the specials. Like I was literally sitting there for 5+ minutes listening to him go in detail about each of the food items which was a little much. But again, that isn't a huge deal. I had a great meal and a good time. Definitely would recommend this to anyone looking for a good meal.",

Before our meal came out, we were supposed to get bread. We had to ask her twice for it and she didn't end up bringing it until our meal arrived. I'm not sure what we did to deserve the lack of interest and poor service, but wow. Additionally, the food was subpar at best, so you can bet we won't be returning here.",

It has a beautiful ceiling in the restaurant, great little street it's on, etc.   The service was great. Our server was on her game and got us our drinks quickly and they were great. Their happy hour drink pricing isn't bad at all, so that's worth checking out.  We wanted to try a few different things as the plates that were passing by looked great. We opted to try the baked olives and the \"side\" of the Italian fries. Olives aren't really my things, but my girl loves them. She really enjoyed them. The Italian Fries were great. I loved the fried garlic and the herbs that were mixed in with them. They were awesome. The aioli which came with them was good but again. It my thing.  We both had a salad, I the house salad and she the arugula salad. The house salad was nice, the veggies crisp with a good vinaigrette. The arugula salad was similar with mozzarella balls(not homemade, at least they didn't taste as such) with tomatoes and a balsamic dressing.  Entree's were up next. I ordered the Margherita Pizza and she ordered the Sunday Sugo. I noticed their pizzas passing by and on other tables and they looked excellent...  Our entrees arrived and the disappointment overtook us rapidly. The Sunday Sugo was everything she expected it not to be. A large slice of pork and a large slice of beef. The menu doesn't clarify this. It just says \"slow braised beef and pork shoulder ragout.\" The expectation was it would have been almost shredded. She was disappointed so we chose to swap. She took the pizza and I the Sunday Sugo.   I like pork and beef, love pastas..but this..it just wasn't good. The beef was the best part, as were the noodles. The sauce had absolutely no flavor. It was boring. I need some herbs, some garlic, something else. The pork had more fat on it than actual meat. It didn't really even taste like tomato sauce. A jar of Ragu actually has more flavor. At least it taste like tomatoes. Incredibly disappointing.  The pizza, again, disappointing. It was a crispy cracker, over cooked and absolutely flavorless. The parmesan sprinkle that was offered seemed like It came out of a canister of Kraft Parmesan. The sauce was border line dried out. Interestingly enough, other pizzas looked great.  We passed on dessert, obviously.",

Happy Hour is 4-7 and had $1 off wines and some great beer options.  We stared with a cheeseplate and garlic bread for our appetizers. Wow both were amazing! The cheeseplate had 4 different cheese, candied nuts, a jam and crustinis. The garlic bread had so much flavor and was cooked to perfection.  Now onto the pasta. I really cannot put into words how good this pasta was. The noodles are homemade daily. I got the marinara pasta while my husband got the bolognese. The noodles were thick and doughy, and the sauce had a nice thick consistency. The flavor even had a tiny bit of a pepper taste which I love. The portion was a great size too.  Service was friendly and quick. She answered my million questions and gave a good recommendation when I asked about what noodle to get.  We left happy as could be. This place is a great date night spot! We cannot wait to come back and try the pizza.",

The $28 bottles of wine were well received and there are enough choices of both red and white for most people.  Services was fine. Place was packed on a Saturday night but the noise level was manageable. The Burrata and Arugula caprese with marinated tomatoes was perfect. The fresh bread with chevre was a nice touch. Not a forkful of the white clam sauce over fresh pasta was wasted. The seasonal ravioli with pear was also a hit. Two orders of perfectly seared Scottish Salmon over risotto completed the delivery to our table.  The house-made Tiramasu was a nice size and with a nice balance of flavors.   Food allergy friendly. Probably not well suited for young children.  We shall return.",

But it was bad from the beginning. Detals below, but overall summary: terrible food and management.   The chef and manager were unbelievably rude.  Ordering off the special menu, we each had an order of Beef Carpaccio.  The plates and meat were so cold, we could barely pry the mear off the plate.  No acid either.  Terrible.  Alerting our server, she kindly brought us new serving.  They were mush and had obviously been just put under a warming lamp.  They were awful.  And no one asked if they should have been taken off the bill.  Second course.  Duck breast for my friend was lovely.  The Pasta I received was underdone; I've had better at chains.  Third course, a dessert--- disaster. I had an ice cream cake dish.  I know it's supposed to be cold, but it was so frozen I couldn't cut it with a steak knife (perhaps with a machete?)  My friend and I were very polite but did note the problems. The server took mine away and offered to take it off the bill.  The manager and chef decided to discuss us at the bar within ear-shot.  Seriously.    Nothing was comped, no effort to bring us back, nothing but dead faces from the manager and chef.  I will never go back and am spreading the word. Let's hope a new restaurant moves into the lovely neighborhood space.  After $150, I would hope for more.  Terrible.  DO NOT GO.",

It was a perfect day- Jen was extremely easy to work with on thinking through all of the details- coming up with a unique menu for food and wine, while helping to not let the cost get out of control.  Joe was helpful when we dropped off decorations the day before the event, and he came out once the food was out to check on everything. The space was perfect for a party of 40 people with a handful of kids and babies. The food was very fresh and all perfectly cooked to serve the large group at once- not an easy task. We had guests from all over, and I keep getting calls on how great the food was and how nice the owners are. I would definitely recommend working with Jen and Joe to anyone for an event. I can't wait to go back for dinner and try some additional things on their menu.",
