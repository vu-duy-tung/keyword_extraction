    "text": "NOTE: This review is for the West View location.  Long day at work + poor planning = not having eaten for 10 hours and having nothing in the house suitable for Lent. Enter Mandy's Pizza, whose ad I spotted on the back of the Pennysaver. Their menu kind of cracked me up so I decided to give them a try (although I wish they delivered ice cream from West View).  The guy who answered the phone and took my order was SUPER competent (asked for my card number, got my address and helped me give him directions to it, etc.) and also really, really polite. I noted I was new to this area of town and he said \"Welcome to the neighborhood!\" Maybe I had too long a day at work, but I thought that was swell.  Delivery was fast (on a Friday night!) -- just half an hour from the time I ordered. Unfortunately, I ordered a 2L and only got a cup of pop, alas. The Buffalo Fries are great, but I must admit I was overwhelmed by the sheer size of them. There has to be 5lb of fries and cheese in here. The Buffalo wing flavor is quite strong, and next time I might ask for plain fries or half and half. Though, if I were drunk, they would have been A+ #1, so keep that in mind.  I also got a fish hoagie. The bread was excellent, the toppings were good, and the fish itself was cooked just about perfectly. Not at all dry, although it could use a bit of salt.  Mandy's also offers a GF pizza (?!) and accommodates allergy requests, which is pretty rare. Given the friendliness of the man who answered the phone, I would trust them to do their best to make an order properly for someone with food allergies.  The portions were HUGE, the prices are really great (even compared to other local pizza places), fast delivery, friendly employees... yeah, I'll be ordering again.  UPDATE 4/12: I've since ordered from Mandy's many, many times, and I think their telephone service is probably the best I've ever run into with delivery places. My roommates are converts now, too. Other dishes:  Honey Habanero chicken pizza is on FIRE. In a bad way. My stomach started to hurt after I ate one piece; it's not so much the sauce as it is the pound or so of jalapenos on top. Fairly tasty, though.  Wings are meh. I'm really picky about my wings, though, and I require them to be cooked crispy (basically, overcooked). These weren't, and were underseasoned (dry Cajun). Not my favorite, although they ARE huge and if you aren't as picky as I am I bet they're good.  Cod fish hoagie platter is a great deal; you get the hoagie plus fries and coleslaw at a good price. It was still big enough to be two meals for me.",

It's the only place I can find when I really want pizza however it's not worth the awful customer service, long delivery time and unpredictable pricing. After dealing with the same crabby guy on the phone time after time to get my oh so desired veggie delight lactose free pizza, I started asking questions like: why are you charging me for gluten free pizza for 12 dollars when all I need is lactose free cheese for 10 dollars and they're explanation was not oh we will honor what our online menu says. It was well that menu is wrong amd the pizza sizes were different and the excuses went on and on with the same usual tone of \"I don't need this customers annoying questions\" attitude. Well, I'm done with this place. I'm not desperate enough to pay $4 extra for fake cheese (instead of $1.50 like it says on the menu) and be treated like crap in the process!",

Amazingly tasty blend of cheese with a bit of a smoky flavor. I've also had their calzone, which is the only gluten-free calzone I've seen anywhere, and it's fantastic as well. My only hope is that someday they will open another location south of the city for those of us who live down this way!",

We ordered a pizza and wings and I will say that we both agreed they tasted great- no complaints there. However, there were 2 big issues we had with our experience: 1) They only offer 1 size of gf pizza; for an average pizza place this might be understandable but when at least 1/2 of your advertising efforts are put toward claiming to be \"allergen friendly pizza place\"- it should be expected that you offer more than one size pizza as my husband and I splitting 4 slices was pretty disappointing...so why didn't we order a 2nd pizza? Well, that leads me to the 2nd issue- the price...$24 for a small pizza (4 small slices) and 6 wings is MUCH MORE than a little on the pricey side. Again, while the food was good, with all the GF options coming available now, we will spend less $ getting more pizza elsewhere.   Please lower your prices & offer more than on sized pizza Mandy's because we'd really like to come back!",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Tuesday in order to pick up a to go pizza.  My fiance, a friend and I were trying pizza from three different places and Mandy's was one of them.  I often drive by here and see their pickup special sign but have never taken advantage of it until this point.  Whenever I called up, I asked for a large cheese to go.  The worker on the other end of the phone asked me to confirm the size of the pizza and I told him the pickup special.  Whenever I got into the place I realized why he wanted to confirm the size as they had all of their sizes on the wall and I think they had 14\", 16\", 20\" and 30\".  Whoever orders that 30\" is certainly crazy as I imagine its a lot of pizza.  Anyways, the pizza that I had ordered was ready whenever I got there and I was in and out pretty quickly.  The guy that was working there wasn't exactly the friendliest guy in the world but he wasn't bad either and he got the job done.  The pizza itself was made of a thinner crust and the sauce on it was good, I think buoyed by the taste of oregano.  The cheeses that they used also tasted good and there was more cheese than sauce in the cheese to sauce ratio which I loved.  Overall it was a solid pizza and was favorite of the three that we went to.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back to Mandy's in the future.  The pizza that we tried was pretty good and I think it is pretty cool that they have an allergen-friendly/vegan menu.",

    "text": "Here's a great Pizza shop with two locations (the other one is in the North Side) for your convenience!  Not only that, but they deliver pretty far from their locations (ie. the West View branch delivers to us in Ben Avon).  The American food - hoagies, flatbread sandwiches, wings, etc., have all been extremely tasty in my experience.  But, what I'm really here to review is the pizza!  So far, I've tested a variety of their yummy pizzas.  They are huge pies, and Mandy's never skimps on the toppings!  However, the dough, though very good, is a little thick for my liking.  Yet recently, I had to completely reevaluate my opinion after trying \"The Pittsburgher\".  Now, if you like Primanti Bros. sandwiches, you will LOVE \"The Pittsburgher\".  Heaps of meat (your choice of turkey, capicola, roast beef, or corned beef) accompanied with tons of cheese, tomatoes, french fries, and cole slaw.... well, it's definitely something you'd only see in the 'Burgh.  The thicker dough works well to soak up the juices in this pie and, instead of the soggy experience you'd have if the dough was thin, you are left with absolute deliciousness!    Other than that, Mandy's offers gluten free dough and other options for those with food allergies.  Overall, a fabulous and unique Pittsburgh restaurant!",

I'm one of the weirdos that doesn't love a mountain of cheese on my pizza, I prefer the sauce to cheese ratio to be equally balanced if not a little sauce heavy. The first time I ordered from here the pizza I received was tasty, however it was buried under a 1/2 thick layer of cheese. This not only makes for a saltier pizza, but in my opinion it results in nearly un-edible left overs.  I tried Mandy's a second time and asked for them to go lighter on the cheese. They happily made my pizza the way I like it which I really appreciated.  I'm giving Mandy's 3 stars because while the service is fast and friendly, the pizza just isn't anything crave-worthy. Yes, it will do in a pinch, however it's just not something I would go out of my way to get.",

A month later we decided to pick up our order. The guy working there pretty much slammed our order down.  On our way out the door we overheard him mumbling because we opted not to tip for numerous reasons. Tonight was the final straw.  We placed an order for delivery.  Not only was the total $3 higher than the menu price , but when we asked if we could pay over the phone with.a credit card, he said \"we don't take cards for orders that cheap\".  I didn't realize $12 for a chicken hoagie was \"that cheap\".  Regardless, this was definitely strike number 3 considering we actually enjoy the food.

The very next time our pizza barely had any cheese and the wings were dry. We decided to order a third time as the tie breaker.  We were told 40-45 minutes for delivery. I called at the one hour mark and was told the pizza would literally be there in seconds. After 20 minutes I called again and spoke with the owner. He said \"All i can say is im sorry\". He never offered to call the driver to see if he was close. He said the same thing as before, the pizza would be there in seconds. I called back 5 minutes later to cancel the order because at that point we were feeding our son something else for dinner. The owner told me that he doesn't think he would be able to get in touch with the driver to cancel the order. NOT MY PROBLEM I told him. We no longer wanted their pizza especially after knowing it had been sitting in the backseat of a car for over an hour! He never offered for us to just keep the pizza if the driver ever showed up. He just said ok and hung up the phone. They lost a customer that night.",

    "text": "Finally got around to trying Mandy's pizza and had an OK overall experience. The place is very small, has seating for maybe 12-15 people. There is literally one, hand-held menu for the entire restaurant. So if there is a group in front of you, which there was, then you have to wait until they are done reading and deciding before you get to read and decide, which forces other people behind you to wait longer.  As for the food itself, I ordered curly fries for an app and a 12-slice veggie w/ capicola which made for a good tasting pizza. The fries were ok but something that bugged me is that I was given ketchup packets. I've never dined inside a restaurant and been given ketchup packets. A ketchup bottle would go a long way (and provide me with the amount of ketchup I need). As for the pizza, it was a standard tasting pie. Nothing mind-blowing or bad about it, just your run-of-the-mill pizza.",

Mandy's crust isn't thin enough to be considered New York-style, but isn't overly bread-y, either. The cheese tastes fresh and sharp, and they know how to wield an herb-shaker. What puts it over the top for me are the tomatoes they top their white pizza with...even in December, still firm, red, and full-bodied, like an in-season, vine-ripened Roma.   Don't let the curt manners of the sales associates and the no-frills dine-in area put you off this amazing pizza.",

Second, we arrived 10 minutes early, but when it was 45 minutes since our call, we heard the guy in the back yelling at someone to make what we could hear as our order.  It was another 15 minutes from that point.  So, one hour in all.  Third, there were about 4-5 people standing around waiting for their orders also.  We all got to listen to the owner or manager verbally abusing everyone and anyone from his staff within earshot.  It was like being at the house of an alcoholic in the middle of a rage.  The poor women out in front and all the customers seemed to be walking on eggshells.    If you care at all about a person's sense of dignity, no one should patronize this place simply because this guy is there.  Fourth, their prices are ridiculous.  Way too much as the pizza was pretty average.  I don't know how they got this rating for best pizza in the North.  Hogwash.  Bellisario's, Luciano's, Mamma Lucia or Monte Cello's all have better pizza.    Lastly, there's a sign over every table about how you better tip, and a large one over the register saying how you should use cash at their establishment instead of a credit card because cc fees destroy small businesses.  Why have a cc machine then?!  Make it cash only, or, join the next century!",

When I opened my food, I immediately knew it wasn't vegan. I wanted the Simple Veggie Hoagie, which is on their vegan menu. My husband called and spoke to the owner. He said there were 4 different menus and they have 4 different simple veggie hoagies but they're all named the same thing. He basically said it was his fault for not specifically asking for the vegan option. He then said that he's \"too old to think of different names for the same hoagie\". After looking through all the menus there is only 1 \"simple veggie hoagie\" option and it's on the vegan menu. I just thought it was unprofessional for the owner of this establishment to place blame on my husband and not even offering to make it right. We will be going elsewhere.",

Sometimes the staff (I assume the owner) can be very short on the phone or even in person. It often feels like you're bothering him by calling and placing an order and kind of kills the fun of ordering pizza.   Also, as others have said they recently put up about 5 different signs shaming you if you pay with a credit card saying you're killing local businesses since they have to pay 1.5% transaction fees on cards.   I don't know whose brilliant idea that was, because it's only going to drive people away like me who never carry cash. They're losing more money from shaming people than from their transaction fees. Their prices are already the highest in the area by far, which I don't mind paying because it's high quality pizza.  A little kindness would go a long ways, and it's the reason why I took a star off.",

Not only does Mandy's serve all of these allergen-free goodies, but their \"regular\" (wheat, egg, dairy, etc) pizzas are incredible, too, so my family says. I make a point to eat here on a semi-weekly basis to get my fix. They use Daiya gluten-free, soy-free, and dairy-free cheese on their allergen free pizza crust and have a huge variety of allergen-free toppings. The AF pizzas are personal-sized, which I love. They use a dedicated fryer and area for their AF pizzas/fried goods and I have NEVER gotten sick once here. Leave it to a dedicated, awesome father of a son with food allergies to bring this heavenly pizza to Pittsburgh. THANK YOU, MANDY'S!! They also sell brownie and cookie mixes in the store! Yum! Oh, and you can buy their crusts to make your own pizzas at home at Whole Foods and Naturally Soergel's in the freezer section! Yay!",

He showed me the gluten free menu but after I looked, the toppings available were real meat which was obviously a problem. I tried to confirm that the vegan meats were not gluten free but he kept changing his answer. I asked if I could just choose a premade vegan option (such as the vegan white) and substitute the crust but he said no because he didn't know how to enter it in the computer. WTF? I was sure that Mandys would have options for me but I guess you can only choose gluten free OR vegan?

It's incredibly affordable and it can usually feed 2 people!  It's a family business that I will never stop recommending. Give it a try!",

The service is great and friendly too I highly recommend this to anyone looking for good food in the Pittsburgh area!",

I have celiac disease and it is extremely hard for me to find somewhere they won't cross contaminate me. I went in and the owner was super super super nice joking around with me and carrying on conversation. He even threw a cookie at me for free they make homemade while I was sitting there. I am so surprised by some people's awful reviews on here. I am very glad I went in and formed my own opinion.  BY FAR the BEST pizza I have ever had. I got a chicken bacon ranch pizza.  I even drove to my fiance's shop to have him try it (he is not gluten free) and he asked when we could go back because it is the best pizza in any form he has ever had. You people are crazy with the bad reviews on here. Keep up the high quality gluten free food!!",

Different menus based on allergies that have tons of options (I'm dairy and soy free), along with tons of regular options, too. Haven't had donuts in forever, and theirs are just incredible.

Once I had a sandwich delivered, they messed it up and when I called to let them know they said \"If you bring it back in we'll remake it for you\" then immediately hung up. So I had to drive the wrong sandwich that I paid to have delivered back to them, then wait for them to make the correct one. No apology. This is one example of multiple bad experiences. Also there's an extremely rude and trashy sign on the wall inside about how they want you to pay in cash. Well it's 2018 and majority of people are going to pay with a credit or debit card and most likely do not even regularly carry cash. As a locally owned small business, I find that appalling. I would rather see a thoughtfully written sign about how credit card transactions are an extra $1 if it's that big of a deal to you. It comes across extremely rude and cheap.",

Honestly, the service is always friendly and I have never been disappointed with anything I've gotten.

In addition to that he prepared a gluten free pizza for my mom.  To quote her, \"I might have to move to Pittsburgh.

We will definitely use Mandy's next year for her birthday party and we live in Murrysville, nowhere near Mandy's pizza!    We've also eaten at Mandy's pizza.

I also told her I didn't want it to happen to another customer. She just said are you ok and came and got the picture frame. She wasn't apologetic or shocked it happened. She didn't try to smooth things over at all or tell a manager it even happened. Very shocked they wouldn't be more concerned we spent $45+ on the meal and she didn't seem to care about the customer.

I get home and open my Sicilian pizza and all of the cheese was stuck to the top of the box. There was barely any sauce and the small amount of cheese was stuck to the top.  We got a half dozen wings and there was barely any sauce on them. Since they are whole wings, it makes it even worse. It was like 2 drizzles over the whole wing.

    "text": "I ordered a vegan buffalo chicken calzone but they gave me real meat and cheese. When I called them, they said they would be sending out the right order. We requested to have our money refunded. The guy laughed and said they would. Fast forward an hour later and we call the delivery driver back and he said that they were not sending one out. I would have preferred if they would have told us that they weren't going to send it out instead of having us wait. It was their mistake that they made. I don't trust this establishment. I can't imagine ordering food with a serious allergy. It is a good thing I don't have a very serious allergy to dairy or gluten otherwise I would have a serious problem right now. If you have a serious allergy or are looking for honest vegan food, don't order from here.",

    "text": "The gluten free white pizza was absolutely delicious! I added spinach as an extra topping, and it was a huge hit with my bf's family. Although the size of the pizza is a bit smaller than you would expect for the price (don't expect the size of a pie you would get in a normal pizza joint - think Trader Joe's freezer pizza sizes, but just a tad smaller), considering how much effort they put into making sure everything is allergen friendly, I'd say it's definitely worth it. This is coming from someone who has multiple food allergies. :)",

    "text": "I was in Pittsburgh recently and discovered Mandy's just a few blocks away from where we were staying. I was attracted by their vegan offerings and was surprised at their extensive vegan menu. I ordered the vegan ham and cheese hoagie and WOW - it was unbelievably tasty. The ham had a great smokey flavor. The bread had a nice crunch and yet soft inside. The cheese and mayo were a perfect compliment along with the fresh lettuce, onion and tomato. It was so good I went back the next day and ordered another one. During our visit I tried the Vegan BBQ pizza (loved the fries on top) - it was delicious. I tried a vegan sicilian pizza with mushrooms and onions. It was a little doughy and could have had a little more toppings. One of the best items I had was the vegan calzone with vegan pepperoni. I had very low expectations for the vegan ricotta but they nailed it. I gave a slice to my non-vegan wife. She loved it and said she felt sorry that I could not eat it because it wasn't vegan. I then told her it was and she was blown away. I live in California and we have a lot of vegan options but this is by far the best vegan place I've been too. Even their baked goods were amazing. I wish they had one near us - do you franchise? You should!",

    "text": "Great pizza and hoagie's. At Mandy's, they make food the way restaurants used to make it, fresh, great tasting, and high quality.   My daughter only eats gluten free and of all the pizza places in western PA they have by far the best tasting and quality gluten and allergen free pizza.   The owner seems to always be here and is genuinely concerned about everyone's experience. This place is truly one of the hidden gems in Western PA!",
