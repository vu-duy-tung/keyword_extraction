    "text": "I had wanted to stop and eat here for awhile. I was so happy we finally made it there. The gentleman working was very nice and he explained that they always have cheese pizza, pepperoni pizza, sausage pizza, a veggie pizza, and a special of the day pizza. We bought a piece of sausage and a piece of BBQ Chicken pizza. We thought we would start with those and then try another piece or two . . .until we saw how enormous their pizzas are!!!!  I have never seen pizzas that huge!!! . Each piece of pizza was $5. Plain cheese is $4. Whole plain cheese pizzas are $30 and others are $35. The pizzas are so big that you could feed two to three families from one pizza. The sausage is not your typical sausage. It is sliced and the size of pepperoni and not crumbles. I wish that they weren't sliced so thin. It was very good. The BBQ Chicken was our favorite of the two. The BBQ sauce was finger licking good. The chicken was real. It was in nice size chunks. I wish the pizzas had a little bit more cheese on them but the pizza is very good. The pizzas are very thin crust until you get to the edge where it's more like a typical hand tossed crust.  Even though the crust is thinner it stands up to the toppings.  Take a group of friends and go try it. Enjoy all of the artwork o the walls!!",

I honestly was not originally intrigued by Benny Fierro's because I thought it was a little much to have these massive slices exist and I didn't really believe they would be as amazing as they are! But wow! My two friends kept telling me that they have been ordering jalapeno popper pizza from Benny's and that it was amazing. I felt compelled to give it a go and I have zero regrets, aside from not going sooner! The slices are gigantic and about $5 each, depending. The crust is thin and crispy. The sauce is not overly sweet and the toppings are all so good! The jalapeno popper pizza was a special for the month of July and had jalapenos, bacon and beer cheese on it. Goodness! I have also had their pepperoni, sausage and this month's special, chorizo and onion. I am fully obsessed with this place! I also kind of like that they only have water/soft drinks instead of having a bar. There is no temptation to grab a beer with your slice and up the bill ten-fold. Cheap, delicious and filling...that's all one could ever ask for in a slice of pizza!",

My only experience was seeing gigantic pizza boxes laying out on garbage day that said Benny Fierro's on them.  \"Home of the Virginia Slice?\"  Ummm...what does Virginia have to do with pizza?  So, I strolled in and ordered one slice of ham and pineapple Hawaiian style.  It was 5 dollars and I was expecting a rather big piece, so I did not order two.    2nd and third visits - I went back to this place for the specialty slice and liked it on the second try.  As a matter of fact I have changed my entire attitude since then.  I am not sure why I didn't exactly like the first time, but I have really liked their pizza since then.  It is one of my favorite places to buy pizza by the slice.  It is a good balance of ingredients and it is not overly greasey, which is a pet peave of mine.  The entire pie is sooo huge I don't think I would ever need that much pizza, but they are great to stop in for a quick bite.  Plus they have really interesting soda's and teas I can't find anywhere else.",

The pizza is thin until you get to the end of your slice and that's when you start to get full. Eating more than 1.5-2 slides would be impressive.   I ordered delivery from BF's once and the pizza box was so large that I had to angle it to get it to fit through my front door! For $30-35 you can feed 4-6 people which isn't too bad and it's fun to eat such an enormous slice. I did the math - one slice at BF is like 3 slices of XL pizza elsewhere, but keep in mind it is effectively thin crust pizza.",

And in my opinion you shouldn't order one with toppings since they're not cooked in the pizzas, they're just added on top and reheated. But it's an excellent slice, New York style, thin crispy crust, zesty cheese. One small criticism, I wish they'd keep a container of Gel GRANULATED garlic to sprinkle on top, not the garlic salt that they have since it makes the pizza too salty.  If you remember Pizza Sola on Carson St., that used to be good, but it is GONE now. It was bought out and renamed almost identically as \"Sola Pizza\" and is no longer any good. Benny Fierro's is almost as good and a bigger slice. Decor isn't anything to write home about and the staff are \"minimally functional\" at best, so you're not going here for the ambience.",

No. However, it is definitely the best pizza on East Carson right now and the closest thing to Pizza Sola which sadly closed a while back. They have your standard toppings, but also will have a specialty pie once a month. I typically just stick with what I know unless a special is really speaking to me, but everything that I've ever had here has been pretty solid.  I'm probably in the minority when I say that I've actually eaten here sober more times than drunk. As Benny's is open after the bars close, I can imagine that this is a great spot to get your drunk food fix.  If you're a New Yorker and used to dollar slices, you sadly won't find that here. The slices are about five bucks, but they are huge. The crust is usually just the right amount of crispy, and the sauce is really good! I will definitely return.",

Easily my favorite pizza here in the city and dare I say I'm not sure I have had a better slice anywhere else in my travels around the globe.

    "text": "I wish I could do 3.5 on this one. But I can't justify doing 4. Is it the best option in Southside? Definitely. Unless you travel down to the works and hit up Michael's.   Went in on a Tuesday around 9 just to grab one to take home. I got 2 slices for myself to go because I didn't want to be limited with just one haha but I could have just had one and been good.   First off, both the garlic sauce and ranch dressing were not good. However, I did really enjoy the sauce on the pizza. The crust was just ok to me. And all around it was pretty decent just not something I would need to go back for any time soon.   The kicker to me is I ordered two slices to go and the to go was just on paper plates and in paper bags. I understand that I didn't pay for a whole pie buy considering I paid $10 and that's the price of normal small pies, I think they could have some cheap boxes. Especially since 2 slices are the size of some pizzas.   Will I go back? If I'm down here super late night and need pizza, absolutely. Just because I want pizza, no.",

As other reviewers have stated, the slices are big. Like bigger-than-your-head big. The pizza had a nice cheese to sauce ratio (heavy on the cheese). The bottom crust was slightly thinner than I prefer, but the end crust was thick and doughy. I did find it a bit greasy, but for $5 a (gigantic) slice, what more could you ask for?  Compared to its competition, this is for sure the best pizza in South Side.",

The NY-style slices are as big as 3 slices of an original pizza at a standard pizza joint. The ingredients they use are of high quality, and the sauce is just right and is seasoned to perfection. The crust is also crispy and scrumptious. I have been going here for more than a year and eat here minimum 3 times a month, and I have never had a bad slice from here. Also, if you're having a party, you only need one whole pizza. $30 for cheese and $38 for toppings, the 28\" pizza will feed a an army. Service is good and friendly, and they're open until 3 on Friday and Saturday. Hand's down must-have pizza.",

    "text": "Well I thought I would see what all the fuss was about.. the place is dark and going for the edgy grunge look atmosphere. Waited on by some teenage young men , long hair, hoodies, no aprons, no hair nets or hair pulled up. Not one apron in the place! No hand towels! SO!...Every dirty hand that had sauce on it that touched money, loaded the soda cooler , wiped their sweaty faces got wiped onto their jeans and hoodies!! Not cool , not edgy, just plain gross and unsanitary.... it's a good thing their ovens are hot because I'm hoping all the germs get burnt off as they are rewarding my slice!!  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for trendy... very mosh pit like music playing, but a decent beat. Menu was very limited!! 5 buck slice or 30 dollars for a whole pizza!! That's it...The slices are thin crust, about the size of two regular slices put together. Pizza was good, nothing to write home about, crust was good, glad they aren't doing the trend of mixing mozzarella with provolone or going all provolone like some places to save money... sauce could have been more as it was very scant. Not enough to say whether it was good or bad, just average. No fountain drinks... just cans of pop for 1 dollar for a twelve ounce can... so that pop they bought at the store for 3.00 a twelve pack  , they are making 9.00!! Pretty nice mark up!! No frills pizzeria. No salads, calzones,Stromboli's or any type of pasta! No Sandwiches of any kind! NOT KID FRIENDLY. And I don't have little kids, so I'm not knocking them for that. 2 out of the 3 bathrooms they had were closed for repair ( used the gender of the day,Family bathroom). Off course when I went to use the soap dispenser, that too was broke.. So on the way out, even though I thought it would fall on deaf ears, I mentioned to the young teenager that the soap dispenser didn't work in the rest room. He said \" oh you mean in the bathroom on the right? I said yes, he said yeah ok\"  So this place is part of a chain, they describe their slice as a \"Virginia Slice?\"  I've been to Virginia, and don't remember it being a cultural thing to get a slice like that and any of the pizzerias. So I think I would have been happy with had the staff had a apron on like you see a lot of the pizzeria guys wearing, long white yadda yadda. Something you can see they actually wiped their hands on something clean and white, instead of something that came off the floor of a pile of dirty clothes in a teenager's bedroom. Perhaps had their long hair pulled up and away from the food we are eating. A few more seasonal lights would have added to the stank darkness of the place.. Somewhat of a more italian menu to choose from... if you don't want pizza, don't go here. It is perfect for college students. Unfortunately my college days are behind me and I was just enjoying strolling down the street with my wife and we stopped in as we had heard much about the size of their slices. Pepperoni or Sausage, that's it , no if's and or buts.. good luck!! lol",

Absolutely.  The service was great, chill guys working hard that really want to see the place succeed.  I will happily be back (probably at least once a week) to continue to support them!

I  believe they are open pretty late for the bar-hoppers appitites.  The super-sized pizza slices provide a nice portion size for only around $5/slice.

Enormous slices the size of your head. Quick service. Games always on TV. Youthful crowd - which gets pretty loud and crowded on weekends.   Staff is incredibly nice and everyone working there is very charismatic. Makes you feel right at home.  Only real complaint is the $5 slices. It's a little insane. I'm a originally from Bronx, and we have slices just as big for $1 in New York, but hey, the pizza is pretty alright. Overpriced for how it tastes, but it's still wicked good.

The first thing she put in my hands was a margarita and of course a hug... and a few squeals in my ear. Lol  It was just past 2:30 AM. People were carrying out pizza boxes the size of a twin mattress! The line was long and full of semi-sober to not-so-sober college students. So you done know this is a GREATTTT sign. Drunk people do not like waiting! No one stands on line for shitty pizza. Esp college students. Straight facts! Moreover, in NYC, the only place you see a line for pizza is at Grimaldi's in BK. So I knew this place had to be Littt.. yes you read that correctly. LITTTTT!!! 20 mins later we got to the counter. I ordered a Pepperoni slice and my girl and her friend ordered a regular cheese slice. I slipped away quickly to wash my hands. When I came back, a slice the size of a 3 month old human was sitting at my booth! The cheese slices were even huger than pepperonis! Let's conceptualize this. Just imagine half a Domino medium pie. Now cut it in half. Yes. That one half of the pie equals a Benny's slice. Guys, I KID YOU NOT! I didn't even know what to do with my self but dash the usual garlic powder, hot-sauce and seasonings on my slice and dig in!  One bite in and I was entering the gooey, ooey cheesy gates of Pizza heaven! You know that moment when you bite into something so damn delicious, your eyes roll back into your head and your mouth springs water from the flavors. I was having a relationship with my Pizza in South Pittsburgh and I didn't have to go to Italy like Julia Roberts in Eat, Pray, Love to do that!  Ahahahaha. I kid. But yes, it was that real.  Benny's Fierro's, you got me. I'll forever frequent this spot whenever I'm in Pittsburgh craving a good slice away from NYC.",

This place conjured up memories of drunken stupors w/ friends in search of anything edible after the bars closed down, then waking up the next a.m. only to find pizza sauce splatter on the crotch of your favorite pair of khakis. I digress. BF's pizza, be it slices or whole pies, are thin but simply colossal. While not my favorite pizza in da 'burgh, it's a True-blue go-to for late night eats. Order. Wait. Eat. Repeat. Oh yeah, it's also of the few places you can get Cheerwine in a glass bottle.",

First of all the huge slices are just funny- and as much as I love pizza- I couldn't even eat one whole piece. We gots whole pie and we were getting stopped as we were walking down the street with people shocked by the size of our box- if you have a compact car you probably should just get by the slice haha. I would definitely recommend this pizza place to anyone who wants a yummy thin crust pizza. Well worth the money for sure",

    "text": "So this review is long over due.  I am a huge pizza addict and i live to eat pizza.  I came to pittsburgh with my fiance and i ordered pizza from this place because they were the only place opened that day.  Wasn't expecting much but we were just hungry and wanted to eat and watch a tv show.  So we ordered their 28 inch pizza and the price was very resonable.  So i ended up getting the pizza and i couldnt believe how big it was.  So on my head i was like ok, their only selling point is that they sell a big pizza but i was like it's probably going to taste mediocre.  I started eating the pizza and it was the BEST pizza i have ever had in my life.  The slices were so big and the pizza was not soggy at all and the cheese was not sliding off nor was it overly greasy.  I was in state of shock how good the pizza was and in disbelief how good it tasted.  I kept waking up every hour throughout the night to eat the pizza because it tasted so good and i couldnt stop thinking about it.  Ever since then ive went to dozens and dozens of new pizza places since i left pittsburgh searching for a pizza thats even remotely similar to the pizza i had there and nothing even compares.  The workers were also very friendly.  I called them and told them i forgot to order ranch and their driver drove back and got the ranch and they were super friendly and nice.  5/5 stars for taste and customer service.",

    "text": "Wow, you guys. Wow.   Does anyone remember the days of Pizza Sola and how huge their slices were but also how sort of lacking in awesomeness of flavor they were? And also the creepiness factor of them always having pizza sitting out for who knows how long and they'd just warm it up in the oven for you?   Well, this place has none of that nastiness! It's right in the swing of things on the Southside and was surprisingly chill for being 9ish on a Saturday night. My friend raved about this place for the past week, but I was skeptical due to other slice based places in the area that were big in quantity but lacking in quality.   The slices, as you can see in my photos, are in fact huge. Two plates worth huge. The best part? THE FLAVOR! THE FREAKING THIN BUT CHEWY IN A GOOD WAY CRUST! THE FACT THAT EVERY GINORMOUS PIE IS MADE TO OTHER AND IT DOESN'T SIT UNDER A HOT LAMP WAITING TO BE SNEEZED ON.   My slice was still bubbling and steaming when it came out of the oven. Do you think I waited for it to come down to acceptable temperatures before tasting it? Pffffft, you must not be familiar with my posts then. This pizza was delish in every possible way, and is appropriately priced at $4 for plain and $5 for a one topping slice seeing as to how you're easily getting three normal slices in one.   It also happened to be the Southside art crawl, so there were a few bands playing and free beer offered. I had Rivertowne Grateful White and it was great! The not so great was the first band that played...the music was entirely too loud for the small space of the restaurant, and you had to yell at the person next to you to hear them at a whisper like level. Seriously dudes, next time you let a band play there tell them to turn the flipping amp down. The second band was lovely and had a smoother chill wave jazz vibe which I liked, mainly because of the 100% acceptable noise level they were giving off.   I'll be back to see if this night was just an exceptional fluke or if this is really one of the best slices I've had.",

The crust in many places was still gummy and raw. The crust in other places was kinda crispy if they could capture that throughout that'd be good. There was little to no red sauce on the pie and for the price def need more cheese and flavor. The dough was flavorless. The size was good but was again you're losing quality here. I think if we asked for double sauce double cheese and extra cook time I'd be happy with this place. Also the staff was not the best. They had one cheese shaker to share with the whole pizza place. We took it to our table shared with 7 people and they had to come take it back. Really one cheese shaker come on? Also we greeted the staff they didn't greet us. We also said bye to them two times before anyone even nodded a head at us. I was disappointed in the customer service aspect and this place definitely wasnt a comfortable environment for kiddos. The pizza did make for a once and a life time stop for giant novelty pizza though, so there's that!",

The crust is doughy, light, and F R E S H tasting. The sauce is what i would say is traditional - not sweet or too packed with herbs. A nice layer is added to the za, deff not overwhelmingly saucy. The cheese is again, exactly what i think of when i think of a traditional za. Unlike some shops, they don't chuck on a lot. Just enough. Bubbled nicely, not too greasy.  I just got the cheese this time around. I'm embarrassed to say i couldn't finish the whole slice! Next time, going in on an empty stomach!

However, for me, when it comes to pizza, size matters not.  I started off with a cheese slice to get a taste of the bare necessities. The crust was thin and crispy, just how I like it. The cheese was nice and gooey, and the sauce had some good flavor. The only problem was that it could've used much more sauce. After finishing that slice, I was struggling to decide whether I wanted another since it was so filling. I figured I had to try something else, so I went with the pesto chicken pizza (which I think is a summer special). I was expecting some integration of pesto into the sauce, but it was simply a cheese slice topped with pesto chicken. The chicken was tasty and well cooked and was a nice addition to the pizza, but it would've been nice to have a bit more pesto.  Overall, the pizza was delicious and a contender for best pizza in South Side. The service was friendly, the prices were a bit high ($4-$5 a slice) but considering the size of each slice it's not that bad. I'd definitely go back to try some other options.",

    "text": "My life has changed since stopping in Benny Fierro's randomly on a Saturday night. Benny Fierro's is a chain offering up the \"Virginia Slice,\" which really just means \"ginormous.\" One slice of pizza here literally sits on two paper plates. However, it's not just a huge slice; the crispy, paper-thin crust, topped with slightly sweet sauce is just amazing. My favorite part is definitely the crust, which is kind of difficult to describe. It has a very nice balance of crispiness and softness that you've just got to try for yourself to understand what I mean.   A plain slice will set you back $4 and a pepperoni or one of their specials will be $5, making it an awesome place for a quick and cheap meal. Benny Fierro's is also open late, which is totally perfect during or after a night out in South Side.   I don't venture down to South Side much anymore, but Benny Fierro's has definitely given me a reason to!",

Honestly it's True that a piece is as big as one's head...or in my case the size of my arse (which is plentiful)! Slices about $5 each which is the way we usually go,  However, we've on occasion bought an entire pie which by the way is 28 inches. No joke, it's enormous. You'd think pies this big wouldn't be Cooke properly and may be raw/doughy. Not the case. Cooked to perfection. Worried about leftover? You'll have them for days.  So glad Pittsburgh is one of a handful of cities that's home to this smaller pizza shop chain.  Pepperoni pizza here is my favorite.",

We enjoyed watching people come in to pick up their pizzas in boxes that barely fit through the door because they were so big.

    "text": "I was here with friends a few weeks back and I must say I was quite impressed by the pizza they serve. They have huge pizza on the display which is quite appetising.   We ordered mushroom pizza and hot lips (I remember pineapple as one of the toppings). Hot lips was quite an amusing name!! They give huge slices of pizza and one slice is like a small pizza you get at regular pizza joints. They are also generous with the toppings they give. One slice is totally worth the price!! I prefer adding extra chilli flakes to my pizza as it adds extra zing to the whole experience of eating a hot slice of pizza. For drinks, I recommend the red ribbon mintt ginger dirnk. Anytime during the day in hot summer, it is my favorite drink. It also goes well with the pizza.   I will go back again and if you are in southside with a bunch of friends or by yourself, you should consider visiting this place for a slice of the huge pizza they serve!!",

Throughout my time in college in Pittsburgh, I've encountered my share of pizza restaurants that attempt to replicate this classic east coast taste but fall short. However, that is not the case with Benny's! The pizza is awesome, with slices that are the perfect thickness and have the optimal tomato sauce to cheese ratio. Additionally, the slices and pies are huge, with one slice as big as a person's head! Definitely filling.  Also convenient is that Benny's is open late on the weekends, which is helpful if you want a bite to eat after a night out with friends in South Side.",

Crust is nice and brown, sauce is sweet and tangy, pepperoni is nice and crispy.  It reminds me of a hip mom and pop pizza shop where you can buy your pizza by the slice, it's like bringing a slice of NY to Pittsburgh.  I believe the cost for a whole plain cheese pizza is $34 and I paid $5 per slice of pepperoni pizza so it is a little pricey, but pizza was good and hard to find the large thin slices like this around my area.",

They're not cheap slices ($4 for plain and $5 for pepperoni) but considering they're so huge and each slice can probably feed you 3x I'd say it was worth it.  They also sell ranch or garlic butter dipping sauces (I think 50 cents for either)- we tried the garlic butter - it was ok - probably unnecessary.  Best part? BYOB! Yay!",

The huge slices of pizza are affordable, yummy and filling. The only thing is the box might not fit in your car lol. Not the best review so I'd continue reading from others who have ordered more from this place just to make sure you don't regret ordering something from here. But if you only want pizza, give it a go and get one of their huge slices. You won't be hungry after you eat one of those or two if you can. I heard that they also have a competition if you can eat so many slices you get $500 or something like that. Check it out if you think you can eat it all. I hope this helps a little.",

Benny Fierro does not exist.  However, there is a Benny_____ and he learned the craft of making pizzas while working for nearly 2 decades in Brooklyn under the direction of Italian chefs.  Unknown circumstances led him out of the area and he settled in a small town situated on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, where he continued making his signature 28\" pizza pies. These signature pies are now served at various Benny's locations.  Each Benny's adds their own second name or description to their individual site to help ensure the anonymity of the real Benny.  There are 17 locations , the majority found in Virginia, several in North Carolina, and one lone location In Pittsburgh, Pa.  Plain slice was $4.00.  Quite reasonable for the size and quality.   Cooler filled with soda and various other beverages.  No beer is sold but you can BYOB.",

I have only been once and here is my review.  The crust was correct for a NYC pizza and that is about impossible to find around here.  Most Pittsburgh pizzas are undercooked and even if you get a pizza cooked enough the crust is super chewy.  Benny's pizza is not super chewy, it is like what you would get in NYC with a nice crunch and a tender center.  The sauce was a little light on flavor.  It could use a little more cheese.  I will return, but like I said, if this was in NYC, I wouldn't.  This is the closest place to a NY slice in Pittsburgh.  Interestingly, they only have whole pizzas that are huge for $30 or more.  I don't mind that too much, but wish they had one other size.  I am happy they ONLY serve pizza and have limited selection of toppings.  That is what you want because the quality can be high and ingredients fresh. NO wings and other stupid things, thank goodness!",

    "text": "Since moving to Pittsburgh four years ago, I have been searching for great pizza.  I'm looking for a thin crust, chewy and crispy, with the appropriate amount of sauce and cheese. The problems I've run into with most Pittsburgh pizza are many. In most cases, there is an obscene amount of cheese and the topping are underneath it, which means the cheese can bond with the sauce and adhere to the crust. When you bite into it, the toppings cause that thick later of cheese to slide off in one bite. Drives me crazy. Aiello's is good, but its not great. You know who makes GREAT pizza in Pittsburgh? Benny Fierro's on the Southside.  First of all, their pizzas are enormous. One slice is just about enough. Next, they make it right - thin layer of sauce, the right amount of cheese and toppings on top, where they are supposed to go. Finally, everything tastes perfect. The sauce has good flavor and the crust is delicious.  Get a gargantuan pie from Benny Fierro's for your next football party. You will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "Benny Fierro's is a chain of pizza shops from Virginia who has recently opened up a location on the bad pizza gauntlet known as East Carson Street.  You probably won't recognize the name Benny Fierro's because each location that they open is given its own specific generic Italian mobster last name.  This place is definitely new and it shows..I tried to call in an order but \"the ringer was broken\".  When you walk in the door you are greeted by a really hilarious mixture of bad art motifs...on one side there is a huge mural or what if I can remember correctly was some kind of crazy animal, I an not sure if the mural is unfinished or just bad.  On the other wall they seem to be going with the random antique/tin sign on the wall motif...the cross country skis and canoe must be on back order.    When browsing the menu at Benny Hoffa's a certain question comes to mind which is \"where is the menu?\" There is no menu because Benny only offers pizza...which only comes in one size...which is comically over-sized....cut in 8.....which costs 30 dollars for a cheese pie.  Unfortunately this is a gimmick pizza shop, which is a shame because the pizza is actually pretty close to being good were it not so terribly inconvenient.   The pizzas at Benny Bagadonuts are made in a brick deck oven but unfortunately they use screens underneath them while cooking so the dough ends up a bit raw in spots underneath the sauce. The middle of the pies are so paper thin that the dough can't really hold the toppings so you end up pretty much being forced to eat the pizza with a fork and knife or to fold it in half. At about halfway up the slice the dough starts to even out to an appropriate amount.  The crust of the pies are super thick and puffy and almost hard to eat...I almost didn't eat the crust, which is usually one of my favorite parts of a pizza. The cheese distribution on the pie would be perfect if the middle wasn't as thin, the cheese was evenly distributed and pulled all the way to the edge of the crust.  The sauce was somewhat ample and distributed pretty well across the pie as well.  The pizza could have been cooked a bit longer and was still pretty soft on the bottom.  If they didn't insist on having such a puffy crust than they could flatten it a bit and actually have a bottom thick enough to support everything.   One thing that stands out about the pizza here is the dough, which I think has a lot more fat in it than most Pittsburgh shops.  Benny Buttafuoco's dough has a nice bready fatty salty taste to it which helps it achieve some sort of crunch despite being made on screens.  I'm not sure if they are using shortening, butter, lard or what but it definitely is a lot more rich than the dough found in most shops around here. The dough has a somewhat medium density, not too dense but definitely lacking the fermentation to make it nice and bubbly.  I would be super curious to try their dough cooked directly on the brick but I can't imagine anyone that works there being able to slide a pie that large off of a peel (or a peel that big even existing).  In general the dough has a great taste with a mediocre consistency.    I think Benny is using mostly mozzarella cheese although it almost tastes like there is a hint of muenster in there too.  The cheese is high quality and melts well without charring.  Benny Mascarpone's sauce is fine.  They are using decent tomatoes and the consistency is a medium thickness which is pretty desirable for me.  The taste is slightly one dimensional...and the dimension is garlic.  It's not an offensive amount of garlic I just wish that I could taste the tomatoes more.  There seems to be some herbs in there too but the garlic is taking over.    In general this pizza is still pretty good by the standards of this city and I will probably continue to eat a slice here once in a while but overall the pizza is not good enough to justify its own ridiculousness.  Pizza is supposed to be easy, convenient and cheap...you aren't supposed to have to tilt it to fit it in your front door, somewhere along the way Benny Lemonjello forgot that.  This place is a fun gimmick for drunk people who want to marvel over an excessively large slice of pizza.  The menu would make it seem they have no interest in selling pizzas to families or businesses, only to drunks. If they would take the same ingredients and offer an 18' pie it would taste much much better than the pie they make now because it would be made better and would cook the whole way.  E. Carson Street has seen shops with better pizza than this close (pizza sola for example) so if Benny Piscopo wants to make it in this city he is going to have to step his game up.

They threw an already cooked slice back in the oven for a few minutes and served it. Not exciting. I'll give it another shot before writing them off completely, and update if we have a better experience.",

It's a little thicker than your typical NY slice, but it's one of the better options for pizza on East Carson. I live a block away from Benny's, so I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "This is a great place for a late night slice of pizza after frequenting other local establishments on Carson street. It will run you $5.00 a slice and there are a few flavor selections, although I've only had the pepperoni. Don't let your eyes fool you....one slice is enough, trust me. I bought two with lofty goals last week and ended up throwing the second one away because I was stuffed and did not want to hate myself in the morning. I rate this place 3 stars for a couple of reasons, it's good - not outstanding, and I wish they would give a girl a box when they see she is going to get a slice to go. Walking a few blocks back home precariously balancing two paper plates is a chore. I will absolutely be back, maybe to try another topping combo.",

The sauce actually has flavor, and the cheese is a higher quality than the other shops the line E Carson Street.  They have pizza and nothing else. Cheese, pepperoni, sausage, and two pizzas of the month. No wings, no salads, no gyros, no pasta, unlike all of the other generic pizza places around the city that are completely undistinguishable from one another.  Not the best pizza in the world, but a good slice in a city where they are hard to come by.",
