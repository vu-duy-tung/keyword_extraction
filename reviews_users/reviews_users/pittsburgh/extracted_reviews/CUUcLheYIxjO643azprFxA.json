    "text": "the menu that is linked from Urbanspoon is for two other El Paso Mexican restaurants. the restaurant in Bridgeville claimed that they have NO website and they are NOT related to the other two El Paso Mexican rest. at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mexicanrestaurantfinder.com%2Felpasomexicangrill%2Fho&s=fbb30e87ec5f35c27dd686b42ad44c5e2489337fafb7a1e3393ade9ac64e01d5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">mexicanrestaurantfinder....</a> me-beaver-falls-east-liverpool.html  if you look at the menu from the link above and the one at Bridgeville restaurant they are the same! different format but the Dinner Combos are exactly the same!  well we printed the coupon from the website link, showed our waiter, he said they take that at the cashier when you check out. we go to check out and they say that is NOT their coupon and we don't have a website only a $5 coupon of some sort... and that is not it. they were very rude about it as well...  food was bland. Just coming from Los Cabos in Bloomfield restaurant last month... this place was a let down. service was fast but the food was just OK at best. the salsa for my taste was fine which was mild but the rest in my group preferred hot. so they added hot sauce to it.  read on other review here on YELP that they have a hotter salsa if requested but they did not offer. also the server was fast but RUDE. he slammed down the salsa bottle and chips when first delivered. no apologies for almost splashing me with the salsa when that happened.  It looks like the same menu as the Ray Azteca Restaurant menu in Sommerset, PA as well. I wonder if they order their menus from some generic Mexican restaurant website...  Bottom line, poor server attitude, no customer service when their server did not tell us that it is not their coupon when we ordered and showed him... and bland food.  Had combo 29 and it was bland and not as good as Ray Azteca Mexican and not in the same league as the Bloomfield Mexican restaurant.",

Last Friday,  I went to El Paso with 3 adults and one baby at 8:30 for a quick dinner. The restaurant was about half full and we got a table right away. We ordered guacamole for an appetizer and I got the Chicken and Shrimp entree. The guac seemed fresh but was lacking in spice. Our entrees came out quickly and were satisfactory though my vegetables were obviously a mix of frozen carrots, broccoli and cauliflower. Can you say green giant? Also, the service is usually adequate though the wait staff often has some difficulty understanding any special orders/requests. For what it is, a small mexiacan place in a strip mall, it lives up to standards. However, if you're looking for good authentic mexican, it's worth the drive to El Campesino in Robinson.",

Our server was visibly annoyed to have to wait on customers from the very beginning with our drink orders.  When I asked for my sauce to be served on the side with my entree, he questioned my judgement.  The food was indeed delivered promptly.  But the quality was simply low average.  No cheese on the chicken enchilada and scant sprinkles on the beans.  Chicken was dry.  After delivering our meals he rejoined the other 3 waiters congregating in the back booth on the right.  The only thing he roused himself for, and seemed content to do, was deliver the bill.  There are so many superior Mexican restaurants in the South Hills that this one is definitely not worth the trip or the money.",

    "text": "I'll note the other one star review of this place relates to the coupon policy. So before I dive in, I'll say that if they honored their own coupons, this would be a 3* place. $8.50 for a combo plate that includes three items, food is decent and comes out very fast, service is average.  They have been in the Entertainment book for a while, in fact you can print out coupons for them from the website, which I did today. They have single handedly added a new restriction to the coupons of $25 minimum purchase. Just because they want to. Now, that's bad enough (and 3-2 star drop) but then the waiter simply rang me up at the pre-coupon price and said 'Come back next time and spend more!'   If they had any sense of customer service, they could have informed of the policy and I could have ordered dessert, which would have easily taken me over the coupon discount amount. But obviously they just didn't want to honor the coupon.  Well, I hope it was worth it. Since the waiter himself decided to simply ignore the coupon and ring me up, a couple bucks came out of his tip. I usually overtip with discount coupons and would have easily ended up spending the amount of the discount. Instead, they lost a customer for life (and I do live nearby) and I can only hope that fellow Yelpers will think twice before going here. I hope the couple bucks they scammed out of me was worth it.",

Over the years we've tried different places around town, very few impress!  After our first visit to El Paso, we were hooked.  The decor and atmosphere are par for the average Mexican restaurant but the food is outstanding. One of my gauges when judging a Mexican restaurant is the chips and salsa.  At El Paso the chips are always hot and fresh and the salsa has a bold but smooth flavor.   When it comes to the menu, there's a lot to choose from but my absolute favorite is the Pollo Con Crema.  The chicken is tender, the sauce is creamy and full of flavor. (and who doesn't love hot flour tortillas!)  The tacos are fresh and the burritos are big.   The service is generally pretty good.  The food always arrives quickly (and hot!), it's those pop refills and special requests that sometimes take a little bit longer.  Check it out - you'll be glad you did!",

Immediately received warm chips and salsa.  Salsa was good but like mine a little spicier.  Of course after the meal, found out they do have a more spicy salsa, if you ask.

I wasn't overly impressed by El Paso- the interior was clean and had the usual sombrero's on the wall. The staff was just OK- they took our order and quickly brought our food, which was my minimum for good service. I was more impressed with the actual food. The menu has lots of good Mexican staples, and some things I've never seen before. For my meal, I tried the chicken with sour cream sauce. I can't remember the actual name of the entree, but if you go, get it. It's small bites of roasted chicken in a sour cream sauce flavored with Mexican spices, and accompanied by rice and beans and hot tortilla shells. I've never had anything like it, especially since sour cream sauce scared me, but it was really good. My wife had the chile rellenos, which were prepared in the more traditional style with the egg sauce on top.  I had an opportunity to try several of my friends' dishes, and they were all tasty, but a little different then my usual Mexican hangout, El Campesino. If you're looking for something a little different in traditional Mexican food and you're not big on ambiance, give El Paso a try.",

I always have a second meal to take home. I just tried the margaritas this time and they were my favorite to date. The perfect amount of sweet, tart, and booze. Very smooth and the perfect complement to the food. We have had burritos, enchiladas, fajitas, and chorizo queso dip. All were fantastic. And I can't wait to see the murals on the walls finished. It's a great spot.",

I told my waiter that I didn't like my food because the order was wrong and he came back showed me his ticket  - he wrote it down wrong so I dont care about seeing the ticket. He should have just apologized and moved on. The customer is always right I didn't say that but he should know....AND then he yelled a complaint about me when he went to the kitchen. (I could hear him)  Not nice. I left hungry and angry.  Wont be back.",

I suppose it's fine if your thing is the standard combo plate menu that 98% of Pittsburgh Mexican restaurants share. I don't get why someone would open up yet another one of those types of places - what's the vision if you're not going to do something different, or even just better? Menu had no seafood other than shrimp done the usual ways and bottom-feeding tilapia. I had the grilled shrimp in chipotle. It was merely OK. No real bite or depth to the chipotle sauce. Shrimp were \"grilled\" I suppose on a griddle, as there were no grill marks. No real reason to go back, but I doubt I'm their demographic as I'd be more up for a Bayless-type of menu.",

I was pleasantly surprised! Price was average I'd guess, and I would come again. If they could at-least get the salsa a bit closer to the average in CA I'd give it a 4*",

I get the Special Yolanda's every time. Just chicken enchiladas. At first the sauce on them was amazing. It made the dish. But each time we went the sauce was different. We went tonight and the sauce was a bland watery tomato sauce. My wife wasn't impressed with her dish either. She got the chimichangas. The cheese was watery and the refried beans looked like they had been sitting out for a while. The top of the beans was dry and cracked. The staff barely talks to you. But I think for most of them English is a second language. Still though. This place used to be pretty busy but was not even half full tonight which is a a Saturday. Plus they were slapped with numerous health code violations earlier this year. Most likely won't be back.",

The waiters speak Spanish and English. There is 25 cent candy for the kids at the register. We always stop in here when we are in town. Great spot and you'll leave full every time.",

    "text": "Absolutely horrible service. The server barely speaks and just mumbles under his breath. He is also very rude and aggressive. My mom ordered another drink bc she didn't like hers, he yelled at her saying she still had to pay (which she had planned on it, she just wanted a different drink). My mom said she knew that and she would pay and he walked away. He came back with her drink and my mom told him he was acting very rude. He didn't respond and when he came to get our bill he slammed his hand on the table so hard to grab it, didn't say a word, and walked away. He actually said 0 words to us after my mom ordered a new drink.   I've never seen someone act that way when they absolutely weren't provoked at all. It was crazy.   The food and drinks are mediocre too. What you'd expect from a dingy Mexican restaurant.",

    "text": "El Paso Mexican Grill has been in Bridgeville for awhile now, and I have never visited there! My boyfriend was at Rumfish Grille for happy hour on Friday night and was planning on picking us up dinner. I knew this place was right next door so I suggested stopping there.   The menu was hard to find online (maybe a lot of people don't order take out from here?) I don't even know if I ordered from the right menu to be honest! I ended up just ordering soft tacos- they come with 3 so I got 2 chicken and 1 beef. Chris wanted the \"Cielo Mar y Tierra\" it was some kind of mixed skillet. I also ordered us chips and guacamole. My tacos arrived really soggy and Chris's meal wasn't even what I ordered! The guacamole also wasn't very good and didn't seem homemade- how can ya even mess up guac?!  Last, when  I called to order, all of the workers were extremely rude. I talked to about 3 different people on the phone when I called which was also kind of weird. I can think of about 15 other Mexican places I would go before coming back to El Paso.",

However I have to say my experience here was an enjoyable one. The atmosphere was calm and quiet for a Friday night and the food was delicious even for me. We did get one meal come to the table wrong but mistakes happen. Definitely gonna return again soon.",

    "text": "El Paso used to be my favorite local Mexican place.  When they first opened, and for the few years following, the guacamole was fresh, the food was consistently good and you always knew what you were getting, and the people who worked there were attentive and nice.  I went a couple months ago and was astonished with its decline.  I decided to go the other day to give it another try, and was even more disappointed.  Everything tastes like it came out of a can.  The guacamole definitely came out of a bag, the salsa was \"meh\" at best, and the quesadilla was no longer spectacular.  I used to go there just to get a quesadilla, so to get what I got this time in comparison was just sad.  And to top it all off, the guy who waited on us has been there the longest of all of them, and seemed so thrilled (sarcasm font) to still be working there.  He threw our drinks on the table AS he was walking away, was mostly silent when taking our order, threw our food on the table AS he was walking away again, didn't ask how anything was, and just gave us our check.  It's sad because it used to be so good; the new murals on the walls aren't even finished, but alas, I will not be back to see the finished product.  If Taco Bell is better than you, you're doing something wrong.",
