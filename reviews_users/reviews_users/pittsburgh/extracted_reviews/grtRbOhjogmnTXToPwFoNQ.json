The Lamb shank is really good at Med Grill and I like the Kibe (baked and raw - did I spell \"kibe\" correctly?). If you don't know what it is you should go and ask about it. Go raw for an adventure. When you go to Med Grill you descend stairs what appears to be like an underground office space (kind of weird) and surprise there is the Med Grill. No windows eww...but great service ...but  the decor is just ok... but I am giving it 4 stars mainly for the BYO and good food.",

    "text": "I've been to the Mediterranean Grill on a few occasions over the past two years.  It always bewilders me that I have to walk downstairs to get to the restaurant.  Yeah, it's underground and there are no windows- nada.  The setting seems more like an office than restaurant, with carpeted floors and plain walls.  If you have problems with closed spaces, this probably isn't the place for you.  Once inside, it's comfy and quiet.  The lighting is soft, and the acoustics are great- even when they're crowded, you can still carry on a conversation at your table.  The wait staff is friendly and very capable.  Most of the employees that work there are related somehow to the owners of the restaurant.  The family atmosphere is nice and feels familiar   The food at The Mediterranean Grill is excellent.  It's all prepared on-site, and extremely fresh.  The choices are varied and vast.  I always start with an appetizer.   The baba ghannouj ($4.25) is delicious.  The roasted eggplant is perfectly seasoned and the spread is especially tasty on their fresh pita bread.  Something you have to try- the grape leaves ($5.25). The leaves are soft, and the rice is warm and flavorful with special Mediterranean spices.  One surprise here- I'm used to having cold grape leaves and wasn't expecting to have them served warm...what a great surprise.  The house humus is velvety with just enough tahini, lemon juice and garlic....try some fresh veggies for dipping.  I usually get the house salad with chicken and zesty lemon house vinaigrette.  It's difficult to determine what exactly is in the dressing, but the tanginess is a nice compliment for the vegetables, and especially for the skinless-boneless breast on top.  Other choices include homemade humus, veggie sandwiches, Kufta wraps, assorted lamb and gyro dishes.  We've sampled almost everything over the past few years, and have always been pleased.   If you're looking for some great Mediterranean food at a reasonable price, this could be the place for you.  The decor is minimal, but the service and quality of food make up for it.  Just remember- keep a look out for the neon sign, or you're sure to pass it up.  The Mediterranean Grill 5824 Forbes Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15217 (412) 521-5505",

The menu is very limited, the place is tiny so it is crowded on a Saturday night (and there was a 15 minute wait), it was a little too warm, and the service sucked even after the crowd thinned out as the evening wore on. I had a kabob pita ($6.95) and my dining mate had Tabbouleh. The lamb tasted good and it was cooked just right, but the onions and peppers inside the pita were way overcooked. They were flavorless and slimy. The main entrees on the menu seemed overpriced with price tags upwards of $18-20. On the bright side, the interior had a nice color with some ornaments on the walls and there was some nice Mediterranean music playing.  But since I like Aladdin's better, I will probably not return.  * all major credit cards including Discover accepted here*  Food Quality/Taste = 2 Stars Portion Size Given Price = 3 Stars Relative Price = 3 Stars Service = 1 Stars Experience with Staff = 2 Stars Decor = 4 Stars Clean (yes/no) = yes",

The place is family-run, so most evenings there's a collection of school-age youths in the corner doing homework.   As a vegetarian, i can't comment on the quality of any of the meat dishes, but the veggie stuff is fantastic. I usually just ordered the mezza, with dolmas or falafel depending on my mood. The hummus alone is fantastic, but add in olives, feta, and the other classic Mediterranean goodies, and it's just divine.  The mezza was usually more than enough for two people to share, and if we added another appetizer there were always leftovers.  The service could be a little slow at times, but the food more than made up for it.   Mediterranean Grill could never compete with a place like La Med in Berkeley, CA, but for the culinary wasteland that is Pittsburgh, it was an absolute gem.",

Some of my friends preferred Aladdins down the way but I was never impressed there... (The food seemed bland).

Its hidden down some stairs on Forbes, you have to look for the little neon sign in the window - but its definitely worth the trip.  The restaurant has excellent, but pricey ($15-20) full dinners of skewers of chicken, beef, etc. that come with rice and a salad with delicious dressing, and it also has a ton of cheaper options for lunch or dinner.  There are pita sandwiches and you can get things a la carte.  I love to mix and match different a la cartes every time I go.  I personally love the spinach lentil and red lentil soups, the vegetarian grape leaves (you get like 8 or so, its a good amount), and the hummus.  The large salad with grilled chicken is also another well-priced and delicious meal.  Portions are generous.  Also, the place is family-owned and the service is very friendly.",

The worst  thing about this establishment is the space. It's in a basement of what is basically an office building -- and it looks like an emptied out office with tables and chairs and dim lighting. The acoustics, as a result, are also bad. But getting beyond that, the food is great. I love their chicken salad for lunch (the dressing rocks!). Their veggie grape leaves are also outstanding. My mother loves the fattoush salad. The waiters have always been friendly and accommodating.  I think the debate about this restaurant vs. Aladdin's up the street is a moot point. Although the food genre is the same, the two establishments have very different feels, as well as different menus, and I think it's nice to have variety within the same ethnic food option.  One other qualm I have about this place is the pita. It is flat and dry and tasteless. Having lived in the Middle East, I know what good pita tastes like, and this doesn't come close. However this is not dueto the cooks in the kitchen at Mediterranean Grill. This restaurant -- along with every other Middle Eastern place I've tried in this city, including Aladdin's -- gets its pita from the same distributor. I think they should demand better or make their own. When I go, I generally don't eat the pita and stick to the stuff that makes me leave wanting more!",

(happy coincidence, the babaganoush was a perfect flavor complement to the shawarma.)  the wife had the falafel and was very pleased-- said it was perfectly crisped on the outside and tender and moist inside.  we had enough to take a bit of it with us when we left.  also, our server, rachel, was incredibly helpful and attentive, without being up in our business.  she seemed to be happy in her job a friendly with all of the customers.  that always makes for a nicer dining experience, in my book.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner with my girlfriend last night, and, well, there's something not right with this place.  We both enjoyed our food. We got the Baba Ghannouj to share and liked it. An unexpected smoky taste, almost like barbecue sauce, but enjoyable nonetheless. My girlfriend got a falafel wrap, pretty average. I got some meat items off the A la carte menu, and they were really good, cooked to medium just as requested. I also got a glass of the mint iced tea and quite liked it.   However, the service we received was abysmal. Normally, that wouldn't really bother me - sometimes you go to a restaurant and you get bad service. Besides, the quality of the food is really what I'm concerned with when going out to eat. But the reason I bring this up and the reason the terrible service angered me, is that over the course of our meal, it became clear that my girlfriend and I were receiving substantially different service than the other customers in the restaurant.  Everyone else seemed to be getting the standard gracious and considerate treatment of a professional waitstaff. We felt as if, in the eyes of the staff, we were barely there.   First, we were seated without menus or the complementary bread. When both arrived a few minutes later upon request, we then had to wait another 10 or 15 minutes before a waitress came over to take our order. We noticed that other tables seated after us were able to place their orders first. When the Baba Ghannouj came out as our appetizer, it came without additional bread (never had this happen in a Mid Eastern place, and we saw that other customers were not treated as such). After we finished the complementary bread, not once did anyone offer, or simply take the initiative, to bring out some more. Again, never seen this happen in any restaurant that provides complementary bread - though we saw other customers receive a second heaping of bread, no questions asked.    Our main course finally arrived. Or rather, mine arrived, and my girlfriend had to wait several more minutes for hers. Basic restaurant etiquette would say that you aim to serve a couple at the same time. Don't want to put one person in the uncomfortable, potentially rude position of eating while the other stares, right?  When hers came out, we both dug into the food, and like I said above, enjoyed it. But as more time elapsed, I started to notice other little things in terms of the service. We spent about an hour at our table last night. Not once during the hour did anyone offer or act to refill our waters. Not once were we asked \"Hey, how's everything? How's the food?\". Not once did the waitstaff suggest we purchase more food. Hell, when we were served, the waitress barely made eye contact with either of us. It felt as if she wanted to minimize her interactions with us as much as possible.   Again, the staff seemed amiable and affable with all others in the restaurant. For some reason, my girlfriend and I were pariahs.  Once it was clear we were done with our meal, that's when the service went into turbo drive. Our waitress came over, asked if we were done and if we needed a take-home box. She immediately said she'd get the check, not probing us to see if we would be up for coffee or dessert. Back and forth she went, grabbing bags, boxes, and the bill, with a speed that was wholly absent for the past hour.   Finally, before paying the bill, I asked to speak with the manager. One of the waitresses came over (she's part of the family who owns the place) to hear our grievances. We talked with her a bit, though she eventually got agitated as we pointed out how we received sub-standard service. Another waitress then came over (note: neither were our primary waitress, but we noticed that since the place was fairly small and fairly crowded, the three of them were pitching in wherever they could. Except with us.) to continue the conversation. She heard us out more than the other.   As I detailed the examples of poor service throughout the evening, she had a convenient answer for everything. We were out of menus when you were seated. It's busy, so we lost track of you for a bit. Other people ordered pre-made items, that's why their food came out so fast. In her view, it was a string of coincidences that led to the misperception that we were treated any differently. But as we pressed her further and insisted that we received substantially different service, she changed her tune. When my girlfriend brought up that no one even made eye contact with her during the night, we were told it was because we had been rude and had given off a rude vibe early in the meal.  I was blown away. They came over so little, that we didn't even have the opportunity to be rude. I acted no differently than I have at any restaurant I've been my entire life. This was all new to me. That's when it hit me. My girlfriend is Chinese. Everyone else at the restaurant was white.",

We had the mezza platter (hummus, baba ghannouj, tabboolee, feta cheese, and olives) and falafel. Hint: if you plan to order this, save the warm pita your server brings you for your dinner. The baba tasted a bit too smoky but the falafel and tabboolee (the restaurant's spelling) were pretty good. The falafel was crispy and delicious. You'll see the option of ordering feta fries on the menu. We did this out of curiosity but probably wouldn't again. This is American-cut fries sprinkled with feta. Only in Pittsburgh can you order fries with Middle East cuisine. With cheese on top. Only in Pittsburgh.  Anyway, it was a decent vegetarian dinner and the service was excellent.",

But I was very pleasantly surprised when I recently stopped by this restaurant and had what I believe was the absolute best, most authentic middle eastern food in Pittsburgh!! I came here with a big group of friends and sampled a lot of the dishes on the menu including the mezza platter with the hummus, tabbouleh, falafel, grape leaves, baba ghanouj, and tried different main dishes including the chicken and lamb kabobs, kufta, kibbe neyye, shawarma, and fatoush. Every single thing I tasted was incredibly delicious. I rarely say this about any restaurant, but the food here really did remind me of home. And the service went over and beyond with making sure we were well served. What a pleasant experience!! I highly recommend this to anyone looking for tasty, authentic lebanese food and I can't wait to come back!!",

Upon the completion of our dinner, a small boy, no more than 8 years old (probably a family member) was cleaning off the table.  Not only did he spill a water all over the table (luckily no ones phone was there) but he dropped a KNIFE, while attempting to carry a dish over my head!!  It is unfortunate to see this place in this way considering their food is so delicious.  seems to be headed more toward a take out spot.",

Overall I thought the food was really tasty and worthy of a 4-star rating. I particularly liked the kibbee as it is certainly exotic and not something you can just find anywhere even among other middle eastern venues. The service was good too as my server was friendly and outgoing. The only minor issue is the location, which is below street level within a residence like hallway. The price seemed a little high but not to the point of being ridiculous. The important elements however, such as the food and service were very good and thus earns an overall 4-star rating.",

I travel often for work and for as many of times I make attempts to try other Mediterranean restaurants I am always disappointed and return back to Pittsburgh and crave the flavors from here.

My favs are Mousaka (with ground meat, potatoes, onions, and zucchini) , Schwarma (shredded lamb, wrapped in Pita with tahini), grilled chicken, rice, green beans with tomato sauce ...those are just to name a few. .. The rice pudding and baklava to wrap things up.  If your ever in the Shadyside area or are able to make the trip a definite must!!!

I ordered the falafel pita wrap here, which I've also eaten at Aladdin's.  The falafel at Mediterranean Grill is good--crunchy on outside, but not dry on the inside.  I'd say it's crunchier here than at Aladdin's.  Two things I prefer about Aladdin's falafel wrap are: the toasted pita and it seemed better wrapped (the Mediterranean Grill one fell apart sooner in my hands).  But, still, all in all, the falafel at Mediterranean Grill is good.  The wrap comes with the usual lettuce, tomato and tahini--nothing out of the ordinary, like the pickled vegetables that Aladdin's adds (which I very much like), but I was plenty satisfied.  The food and beverage selection is smaller than Aladdin's, but it's a smaller establishment, so I wouldn't hold it against them.  (In response to an earlier review: they don't have a hot mint tea, but their iced tea is mint).  The ambiance is weird here, but there's also something cool about trundling down those stairs to the basement and feeling like you know about a hidden gem.",

Upon entering the location you will notice that it reminds you of a dentist office. Weird but True.   On a weekday you will be hard pressed to not find an open table. Fridays through Sunday, good luck. It is an intimate space that allows you to keep your swearing to a minimum (there may be a kid right behind you, and I mean RIGHT BEHIND YOU).   The food is your basic \"kabob-style\" menu. But this is not fast food. Lamb and steak cooked precisely to your request, veggie apps. like baba and tabouli are as fresh as it gets. Rice is delicious!  Also beware of their salad dessing...you will become addicted too it!  Small, but diverse menu. Very good service. Great to take out and eat at home.   ...They now have a corking fee, but who cares? Bring you biggest bottle(s) of wine and indulge, after all it is BYOB!",

If I were blindfolded and challenged to a taste test, it would be tough for me to distinguish the Mediterranean Grill's soup from the home-cooked treat I'm so often craving. The lemony, moist grape leaves are another close contender. The grape leave appetizer, served with pita, is quite filling for lunch.  Sadly, one of my favorite items, the salmon wrap, has been removed from the menu. I'm not sure why they thought this was a good idea, because it means I'm not visiting as often..  A few things to be aware of:  The restaurant isn't well marked, and it's easy to miss. I sometimes walk past it even though I've been there several times. Maybe I'm just spatially challenged though.   The food might taste like home, but the restaurant certainly doesn't look like my family's dining room. Tucked away in the basement, the interior is pretty drab and uninspiring. I suppose if you like speakeasies or sterile rooms with wall-length mirrors, you might feel right at home.  If you like to eat lunch before noon, you'll have to wait outside. On weekdays it doesn't open until 12 on the dot.",

I brought a Saudi Arabian friend of mine, who has actually been to some of the best restaurants in Beirut, Lebanon. He told me, \"This food tastes just like it does in Lebanon!!!\" With that being said, I'm certain you'll be pleased.   My favorite thing to order is the Kibbeh Nayyeh, which is only served on specific days of the week, Saturdays I believe. It's just delicious. I also dream about the lentil dish in my sleep. I highly suggest either one!  What makes this place special, aside from the fantastic food of course, is that it is family owned and operated, and always has been. A wonderful Lebanese family runs the place, which gives the restaurant a loving & comforting feel, which I swear can even be tasted in every bite. Wallah!   The mother of the family and her son are the chef/cook, and they put their hearts into everything they make. The daughters are the servers, and I have to admit that they are VERY easy on the eyes and incredibly sweet. They made sure to kindly break-down & explain the menu to my ignorant American self.   The only negative aspect of the place (struggling to find one) is that the restaurant's location isn't the best. It's sort of in a basement and not so easy to find. However, they told me they're moving to a storefront soon, and I'm very excited for the family and for their customers. I can't wait to try the new place!   But . . . Hey! Let's be honest. As long as the food continues to be delicious, I couldn't care less if they decided serve it out of a truck in the Hill District. I'd go! Enjoy!",

It is probably my favorite of all time, and that's coming from a Pittsburgh Ranch girl. I swear the first time I had it, it was MIND BLOWN. And the second thing that comes to mind in the MEAT! The chicken, the fillet mignon, even the gyro is delicious. My favorite meal to get is the salad with chicken or gyro. It has that fresh, lemony, minty dressing and the feta they put on it is like none I've ever had. I HATE feta, but I love their feta. It's nothing like what comes on your pizza from the local pizza place. This is kinda grated and so, so creamy. It really is unlike anything I've ever had. Usually the BF orders one of the entrees and I steal some of his rice pilaf and add that to my salad. It's like the Mediterranean version of a Chipotle bowl.  I'm not generally a huge fan of their specialties like the kibee or malfoof or grape leaves, but that's no reflection on them, just my child's palate. Because everything is always so fresh an delicious I make myself try everything offered to me (still kinda thankful no one has ordered the kibbe yet). I have tried the grape leaves and they are actually pretty good  It seems to be a family owned place and the place has pictures of the mom and the daughters all over which I find charming. The first time we went I noticed the waitress looked like one of the girls in the photos.  The BF and I were whispering back and forth, when she picked up on it and explained it was her and her sisters. Family or not, the staff have always been great and we have a great time there. They do close earlier than most restaurants, I think around 9 on Saturdays, so keep that in mind. But, one of things I like most, the place is quaint and quiet and great for date night!",

    "text": "Came here for dinner on a Saturday night, after we had already had appetizers in the Squirrel Hill night market. Would definitely not come back!   First of all, the tables were not clean and it was sticky. The ambiance was a let down, felt the place was so dull. Coming to the food, we were surprised to see the dinner portions so pricey. It was about 18-22$. The waitress did tell us, that 2 people can share one plate and we did that. We ordered the shish tawouk which are marinated chicken breast on a rice pilaf. The \"hot sauce\" they gave on the side tasted like straight up marinara sauce. When we asked for some other hot sauce, they didn't have any and gave us regular bottled hot sauce. The chicken was grilled well, but wasn't flavorful.   Finally the check was handed to us when we were through 75% of the meal. We usually like to get a dessert in a Mediterranean place, and felt we were being rushed out. I agree with fellow yelper Jane regarding this point. There are tons of good Mediterranean options in the area and I don't see what better this place has to offer.",

    "text": "I'm giving this place 3.5 stars mainly because the stuffed grape leaves were amazing. They came out and were surprisingly hot (temperature-wise)! I'd go back to have those grape leaves again. We also got a shawarma wrap and a falafel wrap and they were ok, but nothing special. I wish they had better sauces. The baklava was good, super sweet, but they give you a very small piece (good or bad thing depending on your perspective) so it's not overwhelming.  The service was not that great. We had to ask for lots of things, and there was this feeling that we were being rushed out, when we wanted to order dessert.  Ambiance was average. It was kind of fun finding this restaurant though. The underground location makes it feel more special.",

The food is always delicious, hot, and perfectly cooked. There are options for every person (hummus & pita, salads, rice dishes, grape leaves, and so much more).  Seating can be limited and they do not take reservations. So waiting a few minutes for a table is likely (because they're always so busy!) However, when they weather permits, outdoor seating is available!  Med Grille is great for family get together, date night, or for catching up with friends. What's better than amazing food and great company?",

You cannot really go wrong with anything you order there; but, honestly, I just can't seem to get passed these two dishes. I've gotten their salad with gyro, lamb, and chicken.  Everything is great.

They had an entire gluten-free menu (with two sides!) for my guest as well, which was very accommodating. The ambiance is quaint and elegant with friendly, warm service.

    "text": "Just about the worst food  I've had recently. It is really overpriced and the food was very quite awful. The pita bread tasted like it came out of a microwave. The shawarma was filled with lettuce and bland chicken seasoned mostly by sour cream. The spinach pie was greasy and the olives in the Mezza seemed to come from a can. The waitress seemed flustered with the three tables she was serving. Seemed like she was the only one serving. Only one highlight -- the baba ganous was quite good. Unless the cook was on holiday, this place is completely avoidable. Go to Aladdin's across the street.",

The hummus and Baba ganoush were creamy, smokey and delightful. The soups are tasty. And the outside seating is perfect for a beautiful afternoon. Can't wait to get back for more!",

I highly recommend this restaurant to any one of all ages. They are family owned and surprisingly knew my grandfather who used to go in all the time. The staff was very nice and the restaurant was really clean. I absolutely loved it.",

    "text": "A few weeks ago my sister and I stopped in for lunch, and I've been meaning to write this since then because they really deserve a terrific review.  Of all the Mediterranean places I've eaten in Pittsburgh, this is my favorite.  I believe the family is Lebanese.  The daughter, in her 20's, was a delightful, helpful server.  Her mother does the cooking in the kitchen. The ambiance was simple but pleasant, and the tables, dining room  and bathrooms were clean.  I noticed quite a few customers came I n to pick up take-out orders, so that's something to keep as an option.  My sister and I ordered a few things and shared.  The tabboolee (I've seen it spelled other ways, too, but this is how their online menu spells it) was some of the best I've had.  It was absolutely fresh and homemade with a perfectly balanced lemony dressing. The baked kibbee was tasty, especially when dipped in the cucumber yogurt.  Even the side \"house\" salad, which is generally a bore, was really, really good - it had grated feta on top, something we had never had before - and it was served with warm pita. But the best of all was the moussaka.  It was so awesome with a fluffy, creamy just heavenly bechamel type sauce on top.  Seriously, we both couldn't stop making happy yummy oohs and ahhs while eating it.  I can't speak for the dessert, because we were too full.  I also can't speak for the dinner menu prices or portion size since we had lunch. The lunch portions were very generous and a fair price making the meal a great value.  We both said it was one of the best meals we've had out in ages, and we want to bring our husbands back.  We might end the evening with something from the French patisserie, Gaby e Jules, located conveniently next door.  I know Pittsburgh has so many great restaurants to try, but I highly recommend you do yourself a favor and try this place.  We loved it, and we hope you will, too.",

    "text": "The Med. Grill has really good food! We ordered the baba and it was a good choice. The place itself is located in what seems to be a doctor's office, which throws you at first. It's a very basic family set up but I like something about that; no frills just really good quality family-style Mediterranean food! For an entree I got the fatoush salad with gyro. I really do wish it came with chunks of gyro instead of strips, as they were a tad dry. Other than that, it was an excellent experience...service included!",
