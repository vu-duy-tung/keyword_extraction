Me and my friend waited and waited at the bar trying to get a second drink and we couldn't even get a bartender to look our way. Yes it was busy but that was no excuse. We ended up walking across the street to redbeards where we got served immediately. Oh and redbeards has food!",

The service was friendly and attentive enough given that everyone else in the place at the time was seated at the bar and we were at a table in the corner. My mom got the ribs and really liked them--they were tender and juicy and flavored just right. On the other hand, I made the mistake of ordering their ramen (I know it was silly--who orders ramen from an American bar??). The toppings (kimchi, baby bok choy, mushrooms, and pork) were pretty good, although the pork was not as tender as it should have been. The real issue was that the broth was bland, and the noodles were thin and cheap--the kind you get in instant ramen packs. Come here for the good American food and the drinks (which I hear are good, but I don't know from experience), but definitely avoid any Asian food options they might have on the menu.",

Definitely a bar that you'd see in, perhaps, Lawrenceville, so I think it definitely brings something different to Mt. Washington. The beer selection was fabulous, and the bartenders were very nice and friendly. I agree that a kitchen, when it opens, will make this place even more of a win!",

Currently they have a sweet potato bourbon cocktail happening topped with an actual toasted marshmallow. There's also the warm apple cider which I would like to drink every day this winter.  I could go on and on about the drinks but their food is a win too with an also seasonally changing menu. All of their ravioli dishes have been excellent and I've had three different versions of them, right now it is one with mushroom which typically I'm not the biggest fan of but they know how to make me love them.  Also, the atmosphere is great, warm, inviting and with board games. You really can't go wrong. I would absolutely recommend everyone check out this spot.",

The summit always seemed appealing to me but also, tended to be a little too busy each time I walked by (not a bad thing, I know). I chose to meet a friend before heading to the Grandview bakery and I am extremely sad that I have not gone before.  I did not have any of the food but it all looked good. One stand out i remember was their spring pea ravioli, which sounded fresh and delicious. I did have two cocktails. The bartenders seemed incredibly knowledgeable and really friendly. I ordered a drink that I believe was called \"Donnie Darko\" like the movie. This drink is pretty much my existence in a glass. There was rye and a hazelnut maple syrup. Simple and amazing. I also had another drink that I do not remember the name of. I only remember jalapeno and gin were in it. Also, it was gooood. The heat was at the beginning and not on the finish, which I usually find with pepper-based cocktails. It was smooth and not overly sweet. I would have more to rave about if the other drink was not even better.   I will definitely be going back to the summit and the next time I will have food for sure!",

Some change seasonally and others stay on the menu year round. I think my favorite is the Spicy Paloma (tequila, fresh squeezed grapefruit juice, and jalapeno). My husband is a total sucker for the Old Fashioned here. They also have a nice selection of wine.  I think my favorite aspect of this place is the atmosphere. When the weather is nice, they open the windows that surround the space and it's totally open air. They also have a big stack of board games that you can play while you're there if you're so inclined.   IMO, the only downside is the prices. The cocktails and food are expensive, especially compared to other places in Mt Wash. I recommend going during happy hour from 5-7pm on weekdays - the house cocktails are $6 and beer is $1 off.",

I'm sure they would make you a gin and tonic if you asked but they specialize in upper shelf liquors mixed with house made ingredients in unique and in house cocktails.

It's on the smaller side and filled up fairly quick. It seems to be a real hotspot on Mount Washington. There is a reason for that.  I was told that I needed to try a cocktail despite being a craft beer guy. Speaking of, they had a great selection of crafts. But I digress, I was told to order a cocktail before anything else. I went with a go to, an Old Fashioned.  The gentleman behind the bar went to work and it was almost hypnotic watching him make the drink. It was like watching an artist working with his medium of choice. It took him a few minutes to assemble and put some finishing touches on it but was totally worth the wait. After tasting the drink I can honestly say I don't think I've ever had a True Old Fashioned until that very moment!  It was amazing and eye opening! The attention to detail in making the drink really came through. And that is what is great about the Summit! They truly put effort into the establishment. I for one will be making this a regular stop and strongly encourage others to stop by.",

I preferred the Goat Cheese Fritters, which are the same concept as Mozzarella sticks, but they are round balls full of creamy goat cheese. Yum!  The PSV rolls were fried pork and beef spring rolls with a spicy chili sauce. They were only OK, though the portion was larger than I suspected.   All in all, if you are on Mount Washington looking for a delicious cocktail bar and some snack food, this is a great place!",

    "text": "Came to the Summit for happy hour after my parents told me what a great time they had here. Cons of the Summit: even though it's on Mt Washington, you don't get that overlook view.  Pros on the Summit: the drinks; and Grandview Ave is only a block away if you need to see the city skyline after you have a few. Oh and there are charging outlets right under the bar, what a great feature!   Happy hour is 5-7, during which cocktails are $6! It was a Tuesday, we walked in at 6, and there was plenty of seating. Even though I complained about the lack of view, the space does have a large window open to Shiloh street which is nice when the weather is good.  I had the Amabel and the Sex Tape. If you go and read the descriptions, you'll see that these are pretty close to the same thing (gin, grapefruit), but the Amabel was my favorite.",

    "text": "There I was, enjoying a night filled with libations, good conversation, and merriment when it all came grinding to a halt thanks to a \"wolf in waitress' clothing.\" Being a poor student, yet feeling magnanimous, I decided to pay for my table's drinks. I sacrificed a small animal, and lo and behold a demon appeared. With fiery red hair, and a scowl to match, she told me she'd be happy to fetch the bill. She said her name was Melissa--I assume this was her \"human\" name, since revealing her True form would surely destroy the entire establishment. I paid the bill with my debit card and fearing that my funds were running low, I left a 10 percent tip on the bill (just drinks mind you). Before I could leave the rest of the tip in cash, the check was snatched by her talons, and in a blaze she was gone. Moments later, I felt the icy touch of death on my back, with the words \"was there something wrong with the service?\" spoken through forked tongue, sending a chill up my spine. Apologetically, I began to explain that everything was fine, and hurriedly fumbled through my wallet for a greater offering to the beast. Ashamed, I left the required (apparently) cash on the table, taking the tip to about 18 percent. Wanting to make a quick getaway lest I receive another dirty look, I gathered my party (about 4 people, each of whom tipped tipped to compensate my portion) and we began to exit. On my way out the door, Melissa felt the need to announce to the entire building that \"that guy only left a 10 percent tip!\" Defeated, degraded, and emasculated I left her lair and called the manager the next day. He told me that \"this is really an issue for the owner\" and never called me back.  Overall, summit gets 5 stars for location, board games, and food.  My waitress, however, gets 1 star and can go eat a fart.",

They have board games and no TVs. Which just promotes enjoying your company. Their food is so damn delicious. The portions are pretty accurate to how they segment them, small medium and big bites; Delicious on all levels. The menu changes as does the cocktail menu and it seems that everything they produce is delicious.   I had the Green Curry Chicken skewer last time I went. The dish was so aesthetically pleasing and that pleasure was only compounded by how delicious it was. Charred enough to give it a grilled taste with a well-made curry that was accompanied by rice formed into neato slivers that you wouldn't recognize as rice and pickled pineapple on the side. There is a culinary genius at work here who is creative and knows about taste profiles because everything on the dish tasted great and complimented its compadres.   Compliments to the Chef.",

    "text": "I visited the Summit yesterday with my cousin from out of town at around 4pm.  While walking along Grandview Ave. en route to the Mon Incline after ascending the Duquesne Incline, a thunderstorm was brewing, so we decided to play it safe and take cover.  At our arrival, it was totally devoid of customers, but that changed when the downpour struck after 10 min., causing many people to seek a respite from the rain here.  After perusing the menu, we both decided to order blueberry mojitos ($10), as well as goat cheese fritters to accompany them ($7).  It had been years since I'd last had a classic mojito, so I was curious to try the blueberry-infused variation.  The presentation was gorgeous (see photo), and the flavor was refreshing and well-balanced.  While the drink wasn't super alcoholic, it still packed a nice head tingling punch that added to the enjoyment.  The goat cheese fritters came out a bit after the drinks.  Upon biting into one, I was surprised by a cold center, despite the perfectly crispy exterior.  I mentioned this to our waitress, and she took them away and put in a replacement order, which came out about 10 min. later.  Fortunately, the second order was cooked through. I'm a huge fan of goat cheese, and these fritters were light and subtler in flavor than I'm accustomed to, but were delicious on their own. While I'm not a big fan of jalapeno, I tried the candied jalapeno dipping sauce that accompanied them, and it wasn't too strongly flavored. I preferred the fritters on their own, though, so I ate most of them undressed.  One of the more unique aspects of this bar, aside from some of the creative drinks, is that board games are available for entertainment while drinking.  I've seen this in coffeeshops, but never in a bar before, and I think it's an absolutely brilliant idea!  While sipping our cocktails, my cousin and I played a spirited game of Jenga, which I eventually won, to my utter surprise (score!).  As expected, several blocks from the tower toppled onto the table next to us--fortunately, however, none of them hit our neighbors' drinks, and they were good sports.  Overall, my cousin and I greatly enjoyed our impromptu experience at the Summit.  The decor makes for an interesting setting, consisting mostly of distressed wood, as well as garage doors that can be opened (or closed, in the case of a storm!). If you're looking for an alternative to some of the more touristy joints on Shiloh, or are just in the mood for a hand crafted cocktail, be sure to stop by and check it out!",

My date went with a cocktail, an apple cider drink of some sort, slightly more expensive at $9 but worth the price.

Ordered a cheese board and the pork belly ramen.    The food was good enough for a 3-star rating.  Great menu for a bar.  I recommend this place to go if you plan on drinking with friends.   Order some good food, a couple drinks share some laughs.  I was surprised that this place was not hipster.  Huzzah!",

Great selection of cocktails, craft beers on tap, in bottles and cans.  The open air windows is nice to sit during the summer.

I ordered a lemon martini, 8 bucks, the bsrtender didn't chill the martini glass properly so after shaking it warmed up rather quickly. It tasted sweeter than i liked but it wasn't bad. No kitchen, so no food. Let's see how long this place lasts. I was there a few days after opening night, it was very crowded and extremely loud. Not my type of bar.",

And considering this is not a club, they could stand to turn it down.    The place is small, but nicely appointed.  Could definitely use more space.  It was packed on a Wednesday night.  The bartender was very attentive and knowledgeable, and she definitely gave the experience a finesse that is lacking more often than not in 2017.  Cocktails were very interesting, and not at all expensive.  I was expecting an $80 check at the end of the night, and was thrilled when it came back at $51.  That was for four cocktails, a glass of prosecco, and an appetizer.  (Was there for a friend's birthday, and picked up two of her drinks, so really, had it been a regular day, I could go there, and have two drinks and food for $35ish...)  I would recommend purely for the inexpensive well-prepared cocktails alone, but if service is like that every night, I don't think anyone will ever leave disappointed.    I'd like to see more food options on the menu.  Not every single thing has to be elevated and different.  Wings or just plain old fries would satisfy that.    And I know I'm old, but if you don't have TVs in the bar so you can promote conversation, turn the music down to a level where you can actually hear what other people are saying.  We did spend the night screaming \"WHAT?!\" at each other.",

But before I comment on the food. Let's start with the Glogg: a warm mix of cab, port, almonds raisins and a few other details. Wow. On a cold winter day, I can only ask why no other bar/resto serves this. Truly enjoyed this drink..  As for the food menu, it's the perfect size. A few snacks, a few small plates and then some large. I went for the pork dumplings, delicious! The stuffing is well seasoned and the soy sauce come out warm with a slight kick. I could've eating a box!   I finished with some mussels, which were enjoyable. Two details I would change are the chorizo and the toasted bread. The chorizo is not as bold and if it were a nice ground Spanish/Mexican chorizo I think the flavor profile would go along way. And the toast, it would probably be better with buttered/olive oiled French bread rather than sliced white bread..   The. Bartenders were both extremely friendly and welcoming. Explaining the seasonal items and rotating menu. I didn't have any other cocktails, but they all looked great! For a Monday night alone, Tuesday date night, or with friends, be sure to check this place out!",

The place is extremely casual and the music is way too loud but most of the patrons were under 25 so I guess it fits the clientele.  The drinks were very good and I would definitely recommend the old fashioned as it was made with great ingredients. The bartenders knew what they were doing on the cocktail side but that is about all this place did well. We ordered dinner as well and the tacos ($12) didn't have much flavor, the lamb curry ($14) was lacking lamb but still costs the same price as if it did have lamb(?), and the burger ($14) was probably the best thing that we tried. In addition to the average food, there was a weird exchange from the bartenders when they poured my dad the wrong beer. When he asked if it was the one he ordered, they poured him a sample of the one he said he wanted and told him to tell them if they were different. After he told them they were, they got upset before asking again which one he wanted. They eventually got him the one he wanted but the two in question were not the same.  Overall, this place was average. It is definitely a kid hangout that doesn't need to worry about having good food as most people were only there for the drinks. Call me an old man but even with the windows and doors open, this place was extremely too loud. I'm glad I came here but I can't say I would recommend it.",

The drink menu provides a lot of choices for both beer and cocktails.  There are specialty cocktails that change fairly frequently.  Pretty much everything that I have ordered has been delicious.  The burger comes out juicy and perfectly cooked.  Interestingly enough, my favorite thing is the popcorn!  It is soooo good.  The browned butter is my favorite.  The Name that Tune trivia is a lot of fun too.    The food, drinks and atmosphere will definitely bring me back again.",

    "text": "On Mount Washington, this place was a bit out of my way but I'm glad I stopped by for their Happy Hour. There's a bar and some tables, and it was pretty busy and loud by the time my friend and I got there around 6. Just as we made our way to the bar, we noticed that one of the tables was being cleaned up. We asked the bartender if we could sit down there, and he told us to go for it. Within a few minutes, a server brought us some water and took our orders. She let us know that we should make our cocktail orders ahead of time, because it can take a bit for them to come out (especially because it was pretty busy).  The real stars of the show here are the cocktails, and you should definitely take advantage of their happy hour deal ($6)! There's most likely a drink for everyone given their extensive menu.   For snacks, we ordered the Cheese Plate and the House Cut Fries off the Happy Hour menu. The Cheese Plate was great, and I loved the candied nuts that came with it. It came with three types of cheese which were all good, but two of them were pretty similar from what I remember. The fries were nice as well, but I think they accidentally gave us the Tomato Chipotle Aioli instead of the Garlic Rosemary one we ordered. Didn't bother me too much because it was still delicious! Would order the fries again next time.  Final tips: Be careful going down the steep stairs to the bathroom (especially after a few drinks)! Also if you haven't already, it's worth checking out the view of downtown Pittsburgh from the nearby overlook.",

We picked this place out a few weeks before traveling to Pittsburgh because all the other restaurants at the top of the incline are very fancy and we were really just looking for something more laid back and this place checked that box.   We were greeted right when we walked in and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a place at the bar. The bartender was an absolute delight, so friendly, kind, and informative!   I got the smoked gouda mac n' cheese that was very creamy which I enjoyed very much! The cheese plate was also very good, even though the cheese weren't anything special it was still enjoyable.   Something to note, this place is open to the outside so it was very warm which could be an issue for some people. They might have AC but it defiantly wasn't on when we were there.",

I honestly think it is one of the best and inventive cocktail bars in Pittsburgh. Their cocktail menu is super seasonal, and offers up some really great choices. I've always had incredibly made old fashion's. The classics are so great here, I don't stray too often.   But what surprised me the most was the improvement of the food! When they first opened, I believe they did not offer food? Then they started promoting their kitchen and got a new chef I was excited about. I tried a couple dishes that were pretty unremarkable. So I hadn't been back in a while for food. I didn't even realize they totally revamped their menu.   Listen, I am STILL thinking about those delicious crispy fries. There HAD to be some sort of secret ingredient. I feel like I tasted some vinegar maybe? They were so good! Then I had some brussels sprouts, which were equally crispy and delicious. I can now confidently say I will absolutely be back to eat my way through the menu, with cocktail in hand of course!",

They have a pretty decent draft list, and any cocktail I've tried has been great.   As far as food goes, they have some interesting options. I've never actually had a full meal here, but their small plates have always been pretty great. Their spinach and feta dip is not to be missed, and the popcorn is a quick and fun bar snack (especially the roasted garlic and herb popcorn).",

After you've gotten your fill of Instagram photos, venture over to Shiloh Street and check out the relaxing vibes at The Summit. They will greet you will a friendly staff that is very knowledgeable about their craft. They have an ever changing cocktail menu that is one of the best in the city. It's also one of the larger menus that you'll come across with something for everyone. They also boast a nice selection of local and national craft beers on tap as well as a unique selection of bottles and cans. Pull up a seat at the bar or bring a group and grab a table. They also have a nice selection of board games to play. Even the trip to the restroom is interesting with bright and colorful graffiti lining the walls down the stairs and into the bathrooms.

I can't wait to go back and devour their food and cocktail menu.  I would have never expected to find such a trendy spot in the rough-and-tough bar section in Mt. Washington. My friend and I were (rather foolishly) walking around Wednesday night hoping to grab a couple drinks. I don't typically come up here because the bar scene is just not what I'm looking for. After walking up and back Shiloh for a minute, we decided to walk into the Summit because it didn't look intimidating and it was very crowded. That had to be a good sign!  The bar is gorgeous and inviting, with oak accenting throughout. The bar is set to the left and takes up a large portion of the place, but that's okay because the bar is where you want to be here. We found two seats on the end and ordered pretty basic drinks. She had a Tito's cranberry and I had a rum and sprite.  I'm always weary of order specialty cocktails because I either fall in love or I'm so disgusted that I swear off alcohol for a month (hello, Roanoke in Chicago!). Everyone around us seemed to have splurged on a menu item, so next time I come in I'll certainly try it out. We didn't eat much because again, I was not feeling well. The hangover stayed way more past its not-welcomed welcome, and the old adage that you can fix a hangover with more alcohol was not working for me. We had some fries, which were super crispy and seasoned well. I couldn't hang out much longer, which saddened me to the max because I quickly fell in love with the ambiance. They were also playing music trivia. I love trivia!  I can't wait to come back to Pittsburgh next so I can come back and bask in all of the Summit's glory!",

Visiting on a warm spring, fall or summer evening is perfect when they have the windows up and you can catch a view of the city.  Service is good and prices are also reasonable.",

    "text": "I guess I'm well overdue to update my review for this place, especially based on how frequently I am checking in on Yelp.  This is, hands down, my favorite bar in the city of Pittsburgh.  Over time, it's become my \"Cheers,\" where everybody knows my name... hopefully for nothing but good reasons.  The bartenders here are quite possibly the most knowledgeable in the city, and their rotating cocktail menu is a testament to that.  Sure you can get a boring old Tito's and soda (guilty), but you can also have your tastebuds rocked off by a cocktail that you can't quite get anywhere else.  The food is still excellent and this menu also changes seasonally.  Most of the favorites I mentioned in my previous review are no longer on the menu, but they've been replaced by things that are even better.  The dishes they churn out are always consistent and I can't really think of a menu item that I haven't liked. The mac and cheese is always a solid selection, as are the deviled eggs carbonara.  Tacos, bone marrow, dumplings, the Cuban sandwich... there's really something for everyone in terms of food and libations.    Whether I'm in the mood for casual cocktails and conversation or the perfect place to start (or end) my evening, the Summit fits the bill time and time again, and I imagine I'll be back with another 5 star review in due time.",

Fantastic cocktails, shockingly delicious food, a great happy hour, trivia night, and currently the finest Halloween decor I've seen anywhere.   Their staff does leave a little something to be desired though. Sure, all the bartenders are funny, cool, and truly talented when it comes to cocktails...but one of them tried to drown me when I was four years old, and I'm still holding a grudge.  Full Disclosure: My brother works here.   Don't worry though. I would never let it influence my review...at least not positively. That asshole never let me tag along with his friends, and didn't even have the common decency to look enough like me that I could use his ID when I was underage.   Family differences aside, The Summit is awesome.   The cocktail menu changes somewhat seasonally, but they will always be able to provide quality classics, slight twists on the classics (Old 87!), and completely off-the-wall, you-can't-get-this-anywhere-else-and-I'm-surprised-it-works options. There's a drink right now that is made with house-infused porcini mushroom cognac. And I liked it.   The food menu also rotates dishes in and out, but if the brussels sprouts are there, do yourself a favor and get them. They are vegetables, and they are goddamn delicious (the cubes of halloumi help). The burger is outstanding, the fries are perfect, and even the salads are worth ordering. This is far better than average bar food. My only regret is that I spent two days in Pittsburgh inhaling all the meat, and didn't have room for the mac and cheese. Next time.",

We ordered the noodle bowl, and I love noodle bowls... except this was the worst I've ever had.  The broth tasted like luke warm used bath water, and the ingredients had no spice or flavor.  The bowl was DOA.  Then I tried the tacos, also DOA.  Our experience completely went against their reputation, so maybe one day we will recover from this and try this place again.",

The food is only so-so. Its decent for some small bites bar snacks, but I would recommend this place for dinner. However, their cocktails are really well put together and delicious and they have a nice beer selection as well. I rarely make it in time for happy hour, but they also have good happy hour specials.   They also have big bay windows that open up so its a really nice spot when the weather is nice and you kinda have a city view from certain angles. Overall, a great hangout spot to grab a drink with friends.",

Dark and mellow and usually with some sort of jazz playing on the speakers, being inside the Summit is relaxing for a quick spell after work or late night. The bartenders are SO knowledgeable and friendly. Watching them make cocktails is a work of art. I've never tried the food, but it always looks yummy and carefully crafted.   If you've got the time and a bit of extra money, it's worth a stop to the Summit. Play some board games at the tables next to the open garage doors and watch the foot traffic on Shiloh St, or sit at the bar and watch the bartenders crank out drinks. Then, stop on Grandview nearby and check out the best view of the city in all its glory.",

We went during happy hour so we had the drinks and apps deal that was available to us.   The place is kinda small and does not sit any many people.

Getting there by 5:30 gave us a chance to get a seat and enjoy the food beer and cocktails. The cocktails really stand out for me as adventurous, delicious and reasonably priced. They featured some ingredients that were new to me (and I've had a few cocktails in my time). Fortunately the waitress was probably one of the best servers I've had in a long time. She was engaging and really knew her stuff regarding content and profile of drinks and food. She had clear explanations of prep and end product. In addition to that she had a personality. She was terrific. The happy hour plates were enough to share and were brought to the table quickly and without errors. Mussels,fries, and a Brussels/cauliflower mix were enough to fill up some big eaters.",

We were working as photographers up at the Tough Mudder in Slippery Rock this weekend, and the event put us up in a hotel in Cranberry. Neither of us had been to Pittsburgh before, and we had driven out from Maine for this job, so we decided to use Sunday afternoon to explore downtown, not having any idea what to expect. I was told by many people that we HAD to get up on Mt. Washington just to see the view of the skyline, if nothing else. While having beers at a bar over by PNC Park, I asked the bartender where to get dinner, and he said we needed to get into The Summit...so we did, and what a great decision that was. Absolutely everything about the place was awesome. Extremely friendly and conversational staff, fantastic cocktail menu, and the food was incredible! Highly recommend the smoked gouda mac & cheese. That, along with the mixed olives and a couple of cocktails was one of the best meals I've had in a long time! If you're visiting Pittsburgh, get up to Mt. Washington, check out the view (especially after dark), and get dinner or even just drinks at The Summit!",

There are board games on shelves you can play. 2 years ago we each tried 4-5 drinks (lushes, I know) and they were all amazing. We came back, so excited, to have more delicious drinks. I was pleased to see their cocktails were the same- and they also had new seasonal ones. We love to try new things, so we ordered off the seasonal list. Regretfully, none of those cocktails were as great as their staple ones. So I recommend just sticking to their staple drinks!! We got the cheese board and we were not impressed. It came with white bread toast-  undercooked yet burn lines ...? 3 smelly cheeses and nuts and 3 jellies. The jellies were the best thing about the cheese board but they weren't anything out of this world. Don't get the cheese board, and just stick to the staple cocktails!",

We're not big on cocktails (which seem to be what they're best known for) but were tempted by the deviled eggs with pancetta and parmesan (because WTF is better than bacon & cheese?!) They did not disappoint, and neither did the pork dumplings or gouda mac & cheese!  The dumplings were different, the pork was almost like a meatball in flavor and texture... which I actually enjoyed more than a traditional dumpling. To cap it off I had the chicken tacos and my fiance had the burger. I enjoyed the tacos but was too stuffed to finish them. The burger (though not medium rare as both suggested by our waitress and ordered) was delicious and \"one of the best he'd had in awhile.\" Overall a great experience and our waitress Melissa was super friendly, attentive, and cool. I saw some reviews complaining about the price but we're from D.C. so it didn't seem expensive to us at all. We got all the food above plus two hard ciders for $65. Will definitely return if back in the area and recommend to others.",

Perhaps a 2nd stop, but that's a dicey proposition if you've got to head back down afterwards.   The occasion that brought us here was a friend returning to town and holding a happy hour to see everyone at once. On all such future occasions, this is a great place to hold them. The place is spacious, the drinks are well crafted, and the ambiance is warm and trendy.   Also, USB and power plugs under the bar!?! Yep. Very cool addition that I wish more bars would have.",

Over the winter, my favorite of these was a spiked hot cider drink.  These guys also make a damn good Manhattan.  If you're looking for a decent selections of bourbons, whiskeys, and ryes, this is also your place.  They usually have some interesting beers and wines on the menu as well, and I was pleased one weekend to learn that they carry Prosecco, too. Yes, you can pop bottles.  There's a shelf with games in case your group wants to play drunk Jenga.    There are a few small tables with chairs, but I think the use of the space is good.  There are soft-cushioned stools at the bar.    I'm a big fan of the owners/men behind the bar, who are friendly and knowledgeable about their drinks.  The usual bouncer is often reading an interesting book at his post.  My only complaint is the music:  it's usually loud hip hop.  For a cool craft-cocktail place with dark atmosphere, the music seems off.  It's hard to hear people talk and it's not like it's a dance club!  But it may just be my personal preference.",

The smell of spiced cider infused this place. I think it is a great place with a good crowd. By good crowd I mean not too young or old and definitely not a hook up spot.  In the background old hip hop was playing... Tribe called quest... The fall decor was a nice touch too. I recommend as a place to catch up with friends or to go on a date.

The problem I had with The Summit is that I wasn't sure what kind of place it was trying to be. It had all the looks and feeling of a \"modern\", trendy bar - with garage door walls and cool lights - but it really liked some sort of cohesive atmosphere. The The staff treated us like we were at a dive bar. They pretty much never came back to us unless we hog-tied them and getting a smile and anything less than an awkward shrug seemed difficult. This would've been fine if I were only paying $3-6 for my beer, but I paid $9.  Also, the layout was odd. There was all of this space in the middle that could've been used for more cocktail tables.   Overall, I wouldn't be against going here, but it probably won't be from my own suggestion. If they offered some appetizers or finger foods, then it might be more appealing. I think the service needs to match the look and then it would score a little more.",

As I said the space alone is amazing. Just because of the ambiance i'm willing to give it another shot. I wish I could have said better things since this seems to be such a slam dunk for everyone else. Planing on attending the music trivia nights sometime soon. Hopeful that will leave me whistling a different tune.",

Everything from the music to the lighting is exactly what you would want from a neighborhood high class joint.   The drinks are better than ever. Since opening in 2013 they've made improvements to their classics and added seasonal drinks that are great. Their beer selection has improved as well.",

What a cool place. The tunes they play are good, not too loud and the atmosphere was welcoming. I sat at the bar and their drinks look beautiful. I simply enjoyed a few glasses of wine. Bartenders are friendly and not pretentious and the crowd is an eclectic mix of folks. The people next to me got the soup of the day and it looked and smelled divine.   Little tip they do mulled wine, I found it too late, but once we get a little snow I can't wait to return and sip on some.",

The bar tenders and bar backs were very nice and and even though the place was packed they still offered great service and were pretty fast at getting everyone their drink.",

    "text": "The Summit joins the list of several relatively new upscale yet relaxed gastropub/cocktail bars in Pittsburgh.  I came here with some friends the other night and left satisfied but without any strong urge to make it a regular spot.  We started with a few cocktails on happy hour special (6 bucks 5-7 M-F).  All were quite good and were made with care.  If this review were for those cocktails alone, during happy hour, the review would be a solid 4.5 stars.    We waited about an hour total for a table for 4 to open up.  There wasn't really a system to put your name on a waiting list or anything as there wasn't a host/hostess, so people were pretty much just snagging tables as they become available.  Also, they don't take reservations.  We managed to order a few apps (fries, fried goat cheese balls, and the cheese plate).  All were good, though the cheese plate had only one solid cheese and two soft cheeses.  For entrees we decided to split a few dishes, so I ended up trying the pork belly ramen, the burger, a root vegetable salad, and the green curry chicken wings.  I wasn't a big fan of the ramen as the noodles were somewhat under-cooked and the portion was quite small for the price ($16), the burger and wings were great though.  We saw some other tables get the tacos, which we would have given them a try, but they were sold out by the time we ordered :(  Overall, a good experience, and probably the best option in Mount Washington if you're looking for a trendy place off Grandview.  However, I'd rank them slightly below places like Station, Tender, or Butcher and the Rye.",

There is a perfect mix of Mount Washington regulars and Mon Incline tourists that makes for a conversation that'll really remind you of how exquisite this city is!",

Bottom line, every time we've been there everything we ate and drank was GREAT and the service was always good. They have games there you can play too!

Several sauces to choose from. I had the garlic aoli.  They have a good beer menu and a nice specialty cocktail menu,  but I have seen better.  Food and drink aside,  the atmosphere was relaxed and perfect for dining and conversation.  Loved that there is no TV.  Will go back when the weather is nice and the garage doors can be opened.",

It's not every day that you find happy hour pricing on craft cocktails, so we were happy to find that The Summit is an exception; I think we paid about $6 per drink which is really a steal considering the quality.  It's a small space but the large windows/garage doors give it a breezy and open feeling; we had the benefit of being here on a beautiful day. The bartenders were both friendly, welcoming, and made great suggestions. We were here around 6 on a Thursday, and I'm honestly very surprised that it was not busier.   I had an excellent spicy Paloma which combined grapefruit, tequila, and jalapeno. It was fantastic! They did not hold back on the heat which I appreciate; as a lover of hot foods, if you're going to describe an item as spicy, then it better live up to the description!  We only came for drinks, but the food menu was tempting and will be the reason for my return visit. I don't make it to Mt. Washington often, however this gives me yet another reason to hop on the incline and pay a visit.",
