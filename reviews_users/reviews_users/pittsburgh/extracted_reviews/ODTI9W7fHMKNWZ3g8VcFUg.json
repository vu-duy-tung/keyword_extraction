    "text": "If you enjoy Paella and large portions of it, Mallorca is the place to be!  With your order of entree you get an extra plate of spanish rice and steamed veggies and chips, and I would say if you are the type to enjoy leftovers for a weekend brunch, Mallorca will delight you!  The staff was very pleasant and friendly to work with, but I must warn you that on weekends the restaurant gets super crowded and noisy. Also, as the tables are so close to each other, you may find yourself unintentionally eavesdropping on other people's conversations, while at the same time, unable to follow conversation with a person sitting across from you at your table.  The prices are a bit steep, but considering the quality and quantity of food, I think the prices are justified. Also, if you look out for Groupons, you can get a sweet 50% discount.   I would recommend Mallorca for large groups (+4 people) and for celebrating occasions. Although I would not recommend it if you are planning to go on a special date.",

Sausage appetizer, good. Garlic shrimp, good.  The Paella and other dishes, meh. 2 stars at best.   The Paella was a disappointment. They used their regular rice and just added stuff to it. Definitely not the classical paella where the rice and food is cooked together.  The assorted seafood salsa verde, meh. The seafood was cooked correctly, but the salsa verde wasn't like any salsa verde that I had before. Bland. Not recommended.  Definitely not green.  Service was ok. It could have been more attentive. We had to keep asking for items, refills, bread, etc. This should have been handled automatically.  All in all, I wouldn't consider this a Spanish restaurant, but a bar and grill. If you  stick with the grilled selections, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "This place aspires to be fancier than it actually is.  Prices are exorbitantly high, tricking you into thinking you're going to get a quality meal.   To assist in achieving this effect, they have white table cloths; I can't speak for all of them but ours was dirty, stained, unpressed, and had something smushed into it that frankly resembled something that would come out of a child's nostril.  My boyfriend tactfully placed a plate over that offensive blemish.   By the way, the plates and silverware look exactly like ones you'd find in a roadside diner or Eat n Park.  Just drives the point home that this is not upscale dining.  They start you out with some bread and butter in little packets (olive oil would have been a nicer touch), and a sad little salad - the greens were wilted and yellowing, and the lettuce hadn't been washed. You could see a large amount of dirt on the white part,  which no, I was not mistaking for pepper.  I also made the mistake of ordering the gazpacho, which was way too salty. I couldn't finish it.  We ordered a bottle of wine; the waiter poured the first glass, then noticed himself that the glass was not clean.  He took it away and brought back a clean glass, apparently having dumped the first glass of wine out.  For a $40 bottle of wine, it was a bit annoying to lose one full glass which he didn't offer to replace.  The meal was slightly redeemed by the entrees; we ordered two of the innumerable specials the waiter rattled off.  Our entrees were each $35, when the quality suggested a $10-15 price range.  The presentation was quite sad - on one side of the plate were some shreds of pickled purple cabbage, on the other, a sprinkle of paprika.  Entrees were accompanied by some sorry steamed vegetables (I agree with the other reviewers' that they look like they were straight out of one of those steamable bags), some orange rice, and a rather incongruous plate of potato chips.   I couldn't figure that one out.  As for the service, it was excessive and cloying.  We had 3 waiters checking on us- one main waiter, and two other waiters/busboys who interrupted our meal dozens of times.  Our water and wine glasses were refilled after every sip.   Our waiter would come by to check on us, then check on the table next to us, then turn around and check on us again, apparently forgetting we'd been checked on the previous minute.  I guess too much service is better than not enough, but we never had a moment to relax and have an uninterrupted conversation.  Look, I'm no snob but I've actually been to the coast of Spain and this food didn't resemble any of the care and refinement of actual Spanish cuisine.  I wouldn't be surprised if the chef has no culinary training whatsoever.  The last straw was when I used the ladies' room on our way out and was scalded by the water, which was hot coming out of both the cold and hot sides of the tap...like boiling hot...like my hands were red the rest of the evening.  We had tickets for a play after this meal and halfway into the show, my stomach started turning.   The next 10-12 hours were not pleasant.  Steer clear of this place, people, please, for your own good.  Bad music, bad ambiance, bad food.  Just bad.",

But, if you weigh more on the quality and flavor of the food, this is the right place to go. Our first app is grilled portabella w balsamic sauce, which tastes fantastic! The portabella is seared to perfection, a little crispy outside and meaty inside. The balsamic sauce on top gives it an acidic touch and really makes the magic! Our another app is grilled chorizo and is delicious as heaven. For entree, we have two dished on the special menu, the whole fish for my friend and the crab filled lobster for me. I loooove my lobster. The meat is not hard or overcooked at all and it retains all the freshness and flavor of the lobster. Also it tastes amazing w the lemon juice. My friend loves her fish. It was presented as an intact fish and they deboned it on table side. They have a dessert tray and we tried four of them. I love the citrus tart, or at least I think it's a citrus tart. Other desserts are just normal good. The service is among the top. After we were seated, three different servers offered to take our order for the drink. And they offered two drinks on the house. This place deserves a five star and I will come here again for sure in the future!",

It is too bad to see one or two stars in some of the reviews.  We came back to see how they are doing. So first time in 20 years, we are coming back. They did meet our expectation. Quality food and quality service.  First time visit, you should order Paella. This is a must. You can order one or two serving for four. Then order, two appetizer. Recommend seafood based appetizer (stuffed squid, sauteed octopus, etc). If you get two to three main dish, this will be plenty to chow.   I like the Paella. You can taste the flavor of variety of seafood and chicken. It is absolutely good. If you are visiting Pittsburgh, highly recommended. If you do not have a car, cab can take you from downtown in 10 min.",

    "text": "Hip hip hooray a little dollop of diversity in Pittsburgh! I'll admit as soon as I saw the outside of the building on my morning commute shortly after moving to Pittsburgh, I wanted to test the skills of La Cocina Mallorca.  I have tried the veal; it was tender breaded just right and savory perfect combination not too heavy and not too light. The side dishes could be improved I don't love the potato thingies and the veggies are ok. But I forgot about that because the meat was so splendid.   I also tried the sea bass which was a special at the time. All I can say is that it was to die for good, I mean so tender not too many times do I die from the textures of foods, often they can be off putting to me. But this sea bass was cooked to texture tender perfection. My family tried lobster and Paella, it was the most sea food in a Paella my stepmother had ever seen. My dad had no complaints about his stuffed lobster.   Great and expansive choice of wines, admittedly I am not a wine pro nor do I have the $$ to spend on some of their wines. But the Sauvington blanc from Argentina was fab, it was the 30$ bottle.   Now can I talk about the decor? When you first walk in you are hit with Art Deco Egyptian revival beauty not familiar with the term.... Ok picture Lotus Flowers, Neo- Victorian woodwork, gorgeous glass behind the bar. It looks the kind of place Capone would waltz into with a dame on his arm, or Bonnie and Clyde Barker would dine at instead of rob.   The back is not as pretty to me, resembles more of an Italian garden party theme, meets den parlor feel.   I've never had an issue with service here, yes the waiters speak with thick accents, because they might be Portuguese or Spanish. This does not bother me when I am faced with accents from a language of a more speedy vernacular I listen harder. It usually works, or you can always ask a second person for help if you cannot understand your waiter.   I would make reservations, it does get very busy on weekend evenings, they have valet parking which is always a plus in my book.",

Specials, wow did they have a lot.  We ordered a Portuguese sausage flambed on open flame at the table.  Great show.   By the way, if I fail to mention it, portion sizes are massive.  There was a great wild boar special (i'm a sucker for wild boar).  The meat fell off the bone.  My wife had the lobster tail in cream sauce special.  It was so rich that we didn't finish it.  Reasonably priced for the quality of meal.  Will be a repeat customer.",

    "text": "Upon entering the dining area, my first impression was not overly positive. The room was crowded, and the tables were too close together; this created a hectic atmosphere which was not very pleasant for dinner. Most people were wearing fairly fancy clothing up to and including full suits.  The waiter tried to push drinks on us fairly heavily and then proceeded to go over the ridiculously long list of \"daily specials.\" I've never heard a specials list as long as the one here - it must have taken the waiter at least a half an hour to memorize it. Note that I don't view this as a positive aspect - while it's great to have specials, having this many is a sign that something is amiss. We decided to just go for the menu.  The bread they provided as an appetizer was excellent, although strangely the butter was served in little packets rather than just in a butter dish. The appetizer salads which came as part of the entrees were basically inedible because they drenched them with so much salad dressing. I got the mixed seafood in green sauce, and while it was decent, I felt that the sauce was too salty and overpowering. My dinner partner's dish was similarly salty and not too exciting. The mixed vegetables which came out were also overdone, and too drenched in some sort of sauce.  Overall, the best part of the meal was the bread which is kind of sad. The other food wasn't necessarily bad, it just wasn't very good. My overall impression of the place was that they were trying just a little too hard, but not quite making it. Certainly for the price, I don't think it's worth it.",

I've also noticed that each of the four times I've been here, he was also there. Excellent to have the owner/operator around to keep things top shape.  Sat us in a corner this time, wallpaper is a bit old, building is a bit dingy, and yes the dining area and lounge have a bit of traffic, but it's fine with me. Adds to the experience, gives the restaurant character, etc.   Food was great, I went with the wild boar special. Alongside were two Delmonico steaks covered in sauteed mushrooms and Gorgonzola cheese. Delicious! Wild boar was done well, also tasted like a exotic pot roast, but no gamy taste to speak of.  Got three side-salads that were decent, but yea, were covered in dressing. Vegetables on a dish were steamed and lightly buttered.  Fresh bread was good.   Another great thing about Mallorca is the portion size. An eating-persons restaurant; you will be lucky to finish half of the portion of most dishes, so expect to have some leftovers or the opportunity (at $6) to get a second plate to share.   Also, Sopa de ajo for any garlic lovers.",

Cons: - Main Course: Paella, Salmon and Filet. Salmon and Filet were not cooked properly / or as requested. The lobster in the paella was rough and didn't look fresh. Portion sizes were large, but not worth it due to the poor taste. - Desserts were awful. The cheesecake and chocolate cake tasted as if they were bought from local grocery store.

My wife and I have been there at least 10 times over the past few years and have ALWAYS been treated like kings! The staff has always been super attentive in my book, alot of the bad reviews appear to be coming from people living on the west coast (?). What more are you looking for?  The food is outstanding, huge portions of quality food. Steaks are really great, last time I was there had the Lamb shanks special, was out of this world good. The meat literally fell off the bone and the sauce was so tasty I had to mop it up with the delicious bread. My wife is a picky pain in the butt, but Mallorca is her favorite restaurant in the 'burgh. Try the Chorizo appetizer, its tasty. Sangria is top-notch too. The prices are not cheap, but as in life, you get what you pay for.  If your food choices revolve around Mc Donalds and Taco bell, you probably cant appreciate Mallorca and should go somewhere else. But if you like fine food prepared and thought out with care, Mallorca is the place for you!",

    "text": "Mallorca delivers on great customer service reviews. Everything I read before coming here said to expect great things. The attention to detail from our waiter and all the bussers made my sister and I feel so welcome!   Valet parking, coat check at the door, a staff that knows the menu and specials inside and out, and little details like table crumbing and helping refill our sangria made this experience exceed my expectations.  I used a living social deal to save a few bucks, the bill was still no joke but if you go wild over A+ service then it's worth it and then some.  The dishes are large, so if you're into smaller plates use the $6 plate sharing charge to your advantage. One paella is going to feed me for a few days.",

The server who took our order was definitely rushing me when I was ordering - asked him how he was and he pretty much just nodded and then gestured me to order - he was obviously very impatient. The food was okay and we didn't have to wait a long time for it. Had the cheesecake for dessert which was good until you were near the end of it and it almost tasted like it had freezer burn. They gave us the wrong bill and it seemed like  they took a while until they were able to find our right one. Not to mention you have no idea what you were being charged for because your order was just scribbled onto this check pad with more prices on the right than what was written down on the left.  Overall, the atmosphere was great and the restaurant is beautiful and trendy (like something I would find in NYC).",

I would give it no-go if you want to order this plate.  Steak is very bland. Simply very very bland. My friend who came with me ordered medium, but it turned out to be well-done.  Flan is really bad. I could only finished half of the plate. I've got a better flan for $1 in Bolivia.   The service is ok to bad. One guy seemed to be pretty rude to us and looked unhappy all of the time. Maybe he just had a bad day so I won't complain about this.  Overall, I don't recommend people to eat here. Go somewhere else.",

I just wish they had a more creative approach to the dish or even had a twinge of flavor.

    "text": "Mallorca is my favorite restaurant. The main reason  is the service. It is superior in every way - from the maitre d' to the busboys & unmatched anywhere. One gets the feeling they truly care about your dining pleasure.Our table of four arrived at our reservation time of 5:45 on the first night snow had fallen this winter. Thank goodness for the valet parking on this night. Our table was ready, and our snowy wet coats were taken and hung for us in front by the bar. Our pitcher of red sangria hit the spot as we listened to the list of specials and examined the menu. We started with an appetizer of Calamari Frito. It was a large portion, not greasy but a little chewy. The dipping sauce was light & pleasantly spicy. Dinner started w their usual salad dressed w the restaurant's thousand-island-like dressing. Prior to the main courses arrive, the table is cleared & all silverware is replaced with a clean set.  I had the Mariscada with garlic sauce. The pot full of shellfish - langoustine, a couple sea scallops, mussels, shrimp & clams - calls for more of the warm sourdough bread to dip  in the garlicky broth & is a steal at $27.95. My sister ordered one of the specials- beef Wellington. It was a beautiful cut & the meat fork tender & flavorful inside the flaky crust. My one daughter ordered   the crab- stuffed trout, Trucha Rellena, which arrived as an unexpectedly large portion of 2 trout. My other daughter was pleased with her order of large shrimp in a white sauce, Camerone Costa del Sol. The meals all come with family- style platters of rice&peas, steamed vegetable platter of cauliflower, broccoli, carrots & snow peas, and a small platter of homemade potato chips.  Throughout the meal the waitstaff was so attentive we felt as if we were the only customers in the restaurant. Dinner ends with a complementary half shot of almond flavored liqueur.  As usual, this was a wonderful dining experience and put us right in the mood for the Manheim Steamroller concert at the Benedum! It is not to be missed.",

The only part of our meal that my boyfriend didn't enjoy was the dessert.   The shrimp appetizer is loaded with garlic! Definitely enough for two people. The stuffed oysters were very filling but I liked the shrimp more.  For entrees I had the chicken in cream sauce which was amazing. My boyfriend had a perfectly cooked fillet.   My lemon cake was awesome but his creme brulee was watery. They substituted it for him.  Awesome service, great wine, and great food! We will be back!",

It's quite obvious that it is a family-owned as they take personal pride in their restaurant.  We had a party of 7 and each person ordered a different entree.  EVERY person loved their food.  Stuffed filet, blackened ribeye, lobster ravioli, lamb, paella, whole fish (can't remember what it was called), etc.  Presentation was fabulous.  Don't forget dessert -- and especially the Spanish coffee.  A bit pricey, but I blame that on the 3 bottles of wine we ordered and all the appetizers !  We will definitely go back and highly recommend.",

Neither were something I would order again and definitely not very memorable. The sausage was a bit dry and the mussels didn't have much flavor at all (although they were some massive mussels). We sat on the patio around 5 o'clock on a weeknight so no one was really there.

I think that I would maybe come back to try an entree, but only if I felt like spending $50 on myself...",

We started off with one of the best Sangrias I've ever had. The bartender's attention to detail was second to none. Our appetizer was calamari with a nice spicy sauce. Amazing taste and the sauce was very flavorful. The next course I had was a garlic soup with eggs and croutons. I'd never had garlic soup, so I didn't know what to expect. I liked it so much, it will be a go to whenever I come back. If I could give you an idea, it has a tingly bitterness to it that feels so good on your tongue. We then moved onto the entree, which for me was pork chops with yellow rice and for my cousin was a cheese ravioli. Now, pork is a particular kind of meat, and has to be made immaculately for me to fall in love with it. Mallorca passed the test. It melted in my mouth and the sauce used on it was amazing. The same good things can be said for the bit of ravioli my cousin had me taste because she said, \"You have to try this VJ (my nickname). It's so good.\" For dessert I had a caramel cheesecake, and loved it. It will be a go to dessert for now on when I go back. Our server was courteous and prompt. He earned his tip, and I made sure it was 20% for very good service. The cherry on top were the complimentary Amarguinha shots they gave us at the end. Final verdict is go here and go here now. Everything about this place is excellent from the food to the staff. Make it a lovely evening or afternoon. But, go at least once and you'll want to go back often.",

Mallorca serves authentic Spanish dishes in huge portions and even though the meals are pricey, you are still getting A LOT of food for your money compared to other more expensive restaurants. For $35 I got TWO generously sized whole lobsters stuffed with crab and shrimp. The other guests in my party got Delmonico steaks topped with gorgonzola cheese and  mushrooms. The steaks were easily 12-15 oz. Everyone is served a salad to start and family style Spanish rice, vegetables, and Spanish potatoes (which are like homemade chips) with the entrees. As appetizers our table got the stuffed mushrooms and flambe Portuguese sausage which they bring to the table in a flaming cast iron pig shaped dish.   The waitstaff is also super attentive...quickly taking away dirty dishes, refilling water, and giving us more bread/butter all before we even notice we've even run low.   Amazing service, even more amazing food. 5 stars all around!",

My food was pretty good -- the lobster was a little chewy and the crabmeat was more shreds than chunks, but it was still pretty tasty. His osso bucco, however, was out of this world.  We also shared the clams casino, which I highly recommend.   The restaurant was definitely more alive outside on a summer night than inside. You could watch people go by on the street and it was nice. Just right.  Service was very attentive and pleasant and upbeat. We had to wait a little before ordering, but after that there was no lull at all. They refilled glasses and took away played at just the right pace. It was really great service.  Overall, I think the lobster could have used some work, but it was a pleasant and rather luxurious experience. I'm glad we came here. I'll be back.",

This most recent trip we got the sausage special for an appetizer that was cooked table side in a ceramic pig...that was adorable. I got the prime rib special and it was probably bigger than my head. It was amazing! And you can't forget about drinks! The pitchers of sangria are a must have and the staff never lets your cup get empty!  The thing that sets this place apart from other places, though, is the service. Everyone is so friendly and fun and really make you feel valued. This trip was a celebration of my friends birthday which I noted in my opentable reservation. Everyone greeted her and wished her happy birthday. They even brought out a piece of chocolate cake for her and one for me too! They even had a candle in it and got so many people to sing. It was great.   We finished the night with a Spanish coffee, which is also amazing, and more sangria. The vibe of this place is amazing. We stayed and laughed and ate for almost 4 hours and at no point felt rushed or not welcome. Very European and authentic approach to meals!  I will always continue to come here and it will always be my favorite! Highly recommended!!!",

Fantastic cuisine, my husband had their homemade spinach stuffed ravioli while I went right for the filet mignon. Save room for dessert-their creme brulee and flan were excellent.

    "text": "Just went here with my husband and our friends. The minute I sat down I was being pressured to pick something to drink. I ended up getting a pitcher of Sangria, I swear it didn't even have any alcohol in it. I've had better Sangria at the Olive Garden.   We sat outside on two tiny bistro tables pushed together. The tables rocked and almost fell over numerous times. The waiter crowded us every 3 minutes actually coming over to pour my drink for me from my pitcher of Sangria. This was an obvious ploy for a tip. He was interrupting our conversation and making things very awkward. A busboy was actually leaning on my friend's chair looking out onto carson st, her husband had to tell him to back off.   When we asked the waiter what the specials were he went on for what seemed like FOREVER! I thought it was ridiculous because the food was good but it wasn't worthy of almost 25.00 for the piece of salmon that I got. Also, I was supposed to get rice and veggies with my meal, instead, they brought the rice and vegetables out on separate plates and scooped some out for everyone. The waiter actually counted to three in Spanish as he scooped everyone some of MY yellow rice onto their plates. I literally paid 25.00 for a piece of Salmon with nothing on it. My husband is a vegetarian so he had to eat ravioli because they were out of everything else. RAVIOLI, seriously? They had four  or five things on the menu for vegetarians, and it was all pasta. So my husband ate Italian while the rest of us ate fake Spanish food. I guess my Salmon was Spanish because they sprinkled some Cayenne Pepper on my plate. Granted, the Salmon was big, I couldn't finish it, but I didn't bother taking it home because I had no sides like I was supposed to. Again, my sides got shared with the table, weird.   My husband and I drank that entire pitcher of Sangria and both of us suspected that it was so watered down with Ice that we got charged 20 dollars for something that tasted like fruit juice. We wanted to get a little buzz on our date night away from our daughter, instead we just felt bloated and sugary.  So, I ordered a gin and tonic for me and a beer for my husband and our friend. My G&T tasted like sugary tonic water and my husband's beer tasted like any ordinary light beer you can get on tap anywhere for 2$. We spend 17 dollars on three drinks, plus a 5 dollar tip because I felt so bad for the people serving us, they looked miserable. So, our meal was 75 dollars and our drinks were 17. That's 92 dollars plus a 20 tip. Sooooo 112 dollars for an ok piece of Salmon, some Ravioli and a pitcher of Sangria! What? Maybe i'm just not down with \"cultured dining,\" but I've definitely had better experiences at nice restaurants that I can eat my food on my own plate, be left alone by the staff, and get a nice buzz going for under 20 dollars.   It could have been a bad night for them. Luckily I had fun because of our friends. However, If I would have been there just with my husband I would have left after the 20 minute breakdown of the \"specials,\" after I was not even given a wine or beer list and forced to order in 10 seconds or less.   I believe this place is nothing but a scam. They kept calling me Senorita, ha ha. C'mon, you guys served my husband RAVIOLI.",

The pieces of squid were larger than usual, extremely tender and juicy; 2 out of 3 of us thought it was the best we've ever had. My wife had a red sangria, which I tried, we both thought it was really good. For entrees they each ordered the lobster raviolis, one in a white sauce, the other red. The white was great and really complimented the lobster ravioli. By-the-way, there was more lobster in these than I've ever seen before. The red sauce had a good flavor, but didn't go with the lobster ravioli at all, it was too overpowering. I ordered one of the many dinner specials, swordfish in balsamic. My fish was overcooked (dry) but the sauce was delicious. I'd go back, and rated it 3 stars. P.S. They gave us each a shot of almond liquor when they delivered the check!",

The restaurant looked kind of small from the front, but there are multiple rooms and levels inside. The service was exceptional. I feel like there were more waiters than tables. We were waited on by like 5 different waiters. The one waiter recited the whole menu to us and made sure to roll his r's...rrrrrrrrroasted.     We started with bread and butter. The bread was fluffy and fresh. For a high-class restaurant, I expected high-class butter, but instead they used packaged butter. A small plate of salad with honey mustard dressing preceded our main course. I ordered the Pollo Mallorca, which is chicken breast stuffed with spinach, raisins and pinenuts in this gravy-like sauce. My order came with a side of Spanish rice. The sweetness of the raisins really added a unique kick. The chicken was a little tough and overcooked though. The sauce tasted like gravy. I think I enjoyed the rice the most--perfect texture and spices.    Overall Mallorca was pretty good, but the food wasn't really worth it for the high prices. The service was excellent though...they even clean up your breadcrumbs and scoop your food for you. It was kind of excessive, but if you want to be treated like royals...Mallorca will pamper you.",

We arrived at 7:44 and were told to wait a minute while they checked the seating arrangements (meanwhile the inside dining area had about 4 tables in use). We didn't have our water glasses filled until about 10 minutes in. We ordered drinks, a glass of red wine and an old fashioned. Drinks took about 5 min to receive. When my boyfriend got his old fashioned, it wasn't the correct drink order. They have a \"new fashioned\" on the cocktail menu and I'm pretty sure that's what they made rather than the original. It took about another 10 min for the waiter to come back so we could order dinner. We ordered the mahi mahi special and the paella de carnes. My mahi mahi was good, but not worth the $40, when all it was dressed in was a lemon/garlic type sauce and about 5 mini shrimps. My bf's paella had a chunk of bone in just about every bite of rice. There was very little flavor, the chicken was full of bones, and the pork loin was over cooked and chewy. We were picking at the sides of our dinner towards the end of the meal, and the bus boy was VERY eager to clear our plates as we were still eating. Why he was so rushed to clear plates, I don't know, but it was very off-putting, especially when the restaurant wasn't even that busy. We only had our waters refilled once throughout the hour long meal, and were never asked if we wanted another cocktail/wine with dinner. 100% a disappointing dinner. I give it a 1-star with the ease to make a reservation (but maybe they aren't busy for a reason...). We won't be returning.",

Having lived in Valencia, Sangria and Paella are the Holy Grail of Mediterranean Spanish food and should not be attempted by amateurs or family restaurants.  Mallorca pulls off both for the perfect Spanish meal while the restaurant itself gives you a European atmosphere (though not particularly Spanish to be honest). Paella had a great Spanish rice, rabbit, chicken, mussels, lobster, scallops, shrimp and vegetables all cooked into perfection.   Went here for my birthday with the fam so price was not an issue (always a great way to get a feel for a restaurant - not pay).  The staff actually were Portuguese but were friendly and helpful with the menu and attending to our table.  At the end of the night, they had caught wind that it was my day and brought out a large cake for us all without anyone having to drop hints.  Definitely going back when I can afford it on my own.",

I got the filet with manchego cheese and it was humongous. The sauce was so good I thought I couldn't finish it, but I did. Everything was delicious, including the appetizers.  I highly recommend the sangria. My sister got lobster ravioli and they asked if she wanted red or white sauce and gladly appeased her request for a mixture of both (pink sauce). At the end of dinner we got complimentary almond liquor shots for our celebration.   Summary: food was mouthwatering delicious and service was amazing. My drink was NEVER empty.

The place was nearly empty , so we didn't experience the noisy, crowded place that you get on the weekend. The waiter didn't have to shout out the numerous dairy specials and we could actually have a reasonable conversation. We ordered the paella and chicken Mallorca, both of which were very good. The portions are huge and in addition they bring house made potato chips and steamed vegetables and bread. We took enough leftovers home for another dinner. The wine list was much improved from our last visit, with a good selection of domestic and imported varieties at reasonable prices. Deserts were the flan and creme brulee, and although we consumed them both completely they were not notable. We did enjoy the complementary almond liquor. Service, obviously aided by the low turnout, was perfect. The menu is diverse and supplemented by numerous daily specials, so there is something for everyone, but if you need potatoes or are vegan you probably should stay away. Prices are reasonable, given the quality and large portion sizes. Overall it's a pretty legitimate Spanish/European restaurant, at least by Pittsburgh stands.",

We loved the paella! The serving sizes were large and they provided a birthday cake for free for our whole table. The staff were friendly, generous, and attentive. Definitely recommend this place for the food and culture. If you're looking for something fancy though, I wouldn't recommend it.",

    "text": "I am very confused by all the good reviews for this restaurant. We came here on a recommendation from a friend, but found it very disappointing . First of all, the ambience did not feel like an upscale restaurant. There was tile everywhere, which made it very noisy and hard to hear the waiter and even the people at my own table. This would not have mattered if the food had lived up to our expectations. Sadly, it did not. Two of us ordered seafood paella. The rice was very bland and the seafood was not much better. The large piece of lobster that was presented on top of the dish turned out to be rubbery and the chorizo and chicken were tasteless. The only good part was the ONE scallop I found in my dish. If a Spanish restaurant cannot even make a flavorful paella, I wouldn't have much hope for the other dishes. The two other people in our party were not thrilled with their entrees either. All dinners are served with rice, veggies and potatoes that looked like large potato chips. The rice was hard, the veggies bland and the potatoes were bitter and unsalted. The food was definitely NOT worth the very high prices. We were very upset because this dinner was supposed to be a Christmas present for my in-laws and it was just a big disappointment for all.",

    "text": "I think my love affair with Mallorca is over. I used to come here all the time, but let me give you the rundown on why I think we've grown apart and why I would prefer to spend my $$$ elsewhere.  No valet last night but we got a spot in the lot for free which was great.  It feels fancy inside. It was a nice excuse for date night and to get dressed up a bit.    As soon as we entered there were lots of friendly movements to take our coats and offer us to our table.  They knew us by the reservation, and even knew who we were when I called to confirm they were open during an ice storm.  We had an expiring groupon that we had to use, and studded snow tires, nothing holding us back.  It was 830 and not many people were there. There were two people at the bar we knew, (love Pittsburgh's two degrees of separation) and only two tables were seated in the restaurant.  I spotted at least 6 waitstaff in their spiffy black vests milling around.  First thing I liked/didn't like. The waiter rattled off a huge list of appetizer and entree specials. This was both impressive and annoying at the same time. We couldn't remember half the list, but it would take too long to repeat. A printed copy would have been better.  The Sour dough bread was very tasty, nice crust / soft middle, could have been a bit better if warmer. the butter was lame.... peel away butter pats, like you'd see at the likes of Eat N Park. they were frustratingly difficult to open and not enough butter inside to make the effort worth it. Maybe good for dieting but not to go with the bread.  Other Portuguese restaurants have good honey butters or at least a nice dish to scoop out butter. For the expense of this place, I expect more.  We had a Premier France Champagne that wasn't bad for $32.  It was less expensive than the least expensive sparkling wine.   They were a bit over the top regarding pouring of the champagne. I love a good show, but it took a while, and it held up another waiter waiting to serve us our  stuffed mushrooms and calamari.    Finally, a third waiter pulled the adjoining table together so that we could receive our appetizers and didn't have to get rid of bread or salad plates.  The Calamari breading had a wonderful light crispness to it, but sadly they were super tough and chewy inside.   The mushrooms stuffed with crabmeat were good but not super exciting. But the sauce was really good with the sour dough.  Unfortunately, the head waiter/manager came over and took my bread plate away while I was mid bite. I was too confused to realize he was taking it away altogether, it still had food on it, he was super quick and never asked me if I was finished.   They were just seating a new table for two, no reason to rush, and we now had an extended table, so why? It left me with no plate to put my share of the tough calamari or mushrooms on. Luckily I was with my husband we share, what if it were a first date?  Adam really liked the sauce on his steak. If you have had the steak years ago, it's changed to a Portuguese style sirloin with two eggs and lots of garlic slivers.  I miss the old, but this newer version was good.  We were both happy with the perfectly blanched veggies.   My Wild Boar Osso Bocca literally fell off the bone and was very tasty.  When the head guy asked how things were, I felt moved to be truthful but not in a bitchy way. we said how everything was lovely but that the calamari was super tough and chewy. He said he'd tell the chef but nothing came of it.  Adam had the Plain cheese cake,  not overly sweet and he loved that the focus was on the good tasting cheesecake  My Creme Brulee was a treat with a nice crispy cover and a good custard.  The cappuccinos were a good finish to a nice meal.   And they didn't have the surprise shot of that yummy liquor that I remembered.   It's been a few years. maybe it's not just Mallorca that has changed. Maybe it's me.   Was it worth $100 (not including the wine)?  No.  It's a nice show, but Pittsburgh has changed too and I think there are enough fine dining restaurants now that they need to up their game to get my attention.",

We started with some Tapas, Fried Olives and Lamb Meatballs. The Olives were the best. Then a small salad. Mix the House and Balsamic Dressings. Much nicer that way.      We had two Chicken Dishes and an Egg Plant with Pasta. The Pasta was worth the money.      We also had a boring Cheese Cake and some very good Flan.      This is a nice place for a special dinner if you want to spend the extra money on service. The food isn't really worth the cost and we ate the more inexpensive items. I had wanted fish but wasn't spending $35 for a Swordfish Steak.      The best part of the meal was the Rice. Absolutely Outstanding!      You can find the same food for less money or make it yourself for much less.       If you want a more reasonable evening eat at their Tapas bar next door.",

    "text": "I guess I'm due for a bad meal.  But actually the entire experience was rather bad. Here's how it went on a busy Saturday night at Mallorca:  We had reservations and were seated quickly.  The dining room was packed.  We were given a list of specials that was quite long.  Monkfish, sea bass, duck and goat were items that piqued my interest.  We started with a pitcher of sangria, white.  We were told that the red and white were the same, except for the wine base.  The Sangria was good, but I cannot believe that the red is orange flavored.  Note:  go with the red. The men also ordered drinks, which never came.  Friends ordered stuffed lobster and prime rib.  Hubs had the paella.  All were served excellent portions and all thoroughly enjoyed their meals. I asked for more information on the goat and was told it was \"large pieces of meat in a red wine sauce, on the bone\".  The sauce was excellent.  The two bites of meat were also excellent.  The bone was apparently the spine.  Getting the meat was impossible, expecially with a large dull table knife. The pieces were also sawed apart, leaving large shards of bone throughout the whole dish. I was raised on a farm - we called this stew meat.    The balance of the meal: rice, veggies and chips were served family style.  I ate some rice, because I could easily 'sop up' my excess sauce.  No other plates were left to eat the sides.  The chips were good.  Hubs asked for his diet coke, again, mid way through the meal.  My plate looked almost exactly the same when I was finished (except for the shards of bone that I stacked on the far lip of the dish.)  We opted out of dessert but very much enjoyed the almond liquer which was served.  I guess you need that clinker every so often to appreciate the fabulous efforts of the fabulous eateries of Pittsburgh.  I will try Mallorca again - I saw some beautiful dishes being served, some at my table.  But I will certainly stick to what they are known for - seafood.  Way too expensive to venture into other areas of the menu.",

We organized a big brunch event here on a Sunday, and they were very accommodating. The set lunch started with sangria and an array of appetizers, like mushrooms, shrimp, and chorizo. Then each person got to pick an entree, with vegetables and rice on the side. After that, there was even a choice of dessert!  The amount of food was eye-poppingly American. I stuffed myself on the appetizer, unaware that there was more food. The main dish I got was the paella. But it was, unfortunately, quite bland, with the chicken and shrimp overcooked. However, the dessert flan was pretty decent.   I think this is a great place to hold events at, especially when the waitstaff was patient and coordinated. It is also surprisingly cheap, but again, my price point is from the SF bay area. However, personally, I didn't really care for the food that much, so I decided to put it at a 3-star.",

I was hoping it was as good as I remembered it to be, and I was not disappointed.   We made reservations ahead of time since it was a friday night, but even still - the restaurant was not packed and we would have been able to be seated regardless.   We started off with some drinks - my husband had beer, and I had a glass of their house wine, salad and bread.   For appetizers, I ordered the garlic shrimp and he ordered one of their calamari specials. For the meals, he ordered a swordfish special and I ordered a 26oz stuffed lobster tail special. Dessert was flan and espresso for my husband, and I got the chocolate mousse.   The appetizers were excellent, perfectly cooked and quite a large portion. The sauces were excellent and they came out quickly.   The entrees were phenomenal. When my lobster tail came out, I literally got a standing applause from the table next to us. It was *enormous*. There was so much lobster, I actually had a doggie bag of lobster to take home. I've never tapped out on lobster before that day!   The desserts were okay. The flan was quite good, my husband is hispanic and has high flan standards -- he loved it. The chocolate mousse left a lot to be desired and really didn't have the airy, light texture. It was quite dense.   They offer a candied liquor as an after-dinner drink that was lovely.   It is a pricey dinner - the bill came out to be about 180 dollars and we tipped to bring it up to 250.00$. Its not something that you do everyday, but there is no reason not to make it a regular outing.   The service is absolutely impeccable with attentive wait staff and knowledgeable employees who are very well versed on the menu.   There is a pay parking lot next to the place, which is small and would easily fill up.  Valet would be a nice touch.   I'm looking forward to coming again on my next trip to Pittsburgh!",

My Mahi Mahi on the other hand was bland and I was super disappointed.  For what I was paying for I wanted to really enjoy it but it was under seasoned and not worth the money. I was also a bit peeved that I called before buying a living social deal and they told me I could use it as long as someone else didn't have that deal. And when it came to pay they informed me that even if someone has a separate deal on a separate bill,  no two people at one table can use a coupon. The rum and ginger ale I got was good and so were my sides. Hopefully when I use my Living Social deal that I still have,  it will be a different experience. I just expected the moon and stars for what I was paying. Maybe they were having a bad day. My friends enjoyed their food. The side dishes were great.

Looking for a traditional Spanish baseline, I decided on the Paella.

Add in the high prices and regardless of the massive portion sizes, this is definitely a one and done.",

Its is very similar to Italian yet different. I had the fresh Dover Sole whole. They filleted it perfectly (no bones) and it melted in my mouth. I also had the garlic soup and it was to die for. A lot of the items we ordered were on the specials, so I don't remember them. The wait staff was superb, friendly, and courteous even though we were a little under-dressed.  The place might have been pricier and a little to much for kids in most peoples opinion, but so worth it and they were excellent to my kids.",

The bread and butter they served was sub-par, you'd expect them to do better. The side salad was served with a Thousand Island  dressing, all the authenticity built up by the ambience and our waiter was fading away real quick; until the Chorizo and cheese stuffed oysters were brought out. The flavor of the chorizo, cheese and oyster complimented each other really well. I ordered one of the specials here, Wild Boar. Two, single bone tender and succulent pieces of wild boar, as huge as my fist. The meat literally fell off the bone as I dug in, you really don't have to use the mega-knife that comes with it. It was my first experience with a wild boar, and what an experience it was. Complimenting the entree was some delicious Spanish rice with boiled vegetables and a slightly disappointing side of fried potato chips. The desert - Creme brulee, a rich custard base topped with a layer of perfectly torched caramel made up for the sub-par bread and salad dressing. Like I said it, Mallorca has it's moments, I'd definitely recommend this place for a casual date night. Be ready to shell out some extra cash though.",

It's the only place I know where I can get a broiled lobster stuffed with crab meat alongside a cauldron of sea creatures for under $50 *and* have a very satisfying lunch for the next day.  They specialize in cooking enormous portion sizes with expertise.  Once I ordered a prime rib and they brought out this two-inch monstrosity with two rib bones sticking out the side.  It had a beautiful broiled crust, perfectly medium, tender, tasty and was probably mooing that morning.  Nearly all of the meals I've had here have been great and those that weren't more most likely because I was experimenting and discovered that I didn't like the dish, not that it was prepared improperly.  As for atmosphere, it's dark, tight, and only semi-romantic because it's always crowded and the walkways are narrow.  Personally, I love it because it's always an experience:  the waiters chattering in Portuguese, romancing the patrons or bringing out eye-popping food that's either oversized, on fire or smelling really good.  Definitely check it out with a date, bust out a couple Benjamins and enjoy yourself (oh, and write a review - we Yelpers would love to see what you think).",

They always seem to have a list of like 20 different specials, including so many fresh fish options I don't know how they do it.  I can barely keep up as they go through the specials list it is so long.  I also love their outdoor seating area when the weather is nice and the staff are very friendly and attentive.  The food is all very good, though some of it is on the blander side and could maybe use a little spicing up.  Some of the prices are a little high, but many of these are high quality meat and fish options and all the portions were quite large and entrees all came with salad and side dishes so you never go hungry. Though sometimes I wish I could have some variety in the sides they serve with it since the side of rice and veggies and those crispy potato chips can be rather bland.  I'd rather have a cheaper dish that doesn't come with all that so I can try some of the other appetizers instead.   I do like that they also serve up some of their fresh fish whole.  The flaming Spanish sausage is also a fun appetizer to get (it comes out on a flaming ceramic pig!).",

Staff was borderline aggressive (except for a young man in a vest which was really nice and polite), sometimes impossible to communicate with. Examples - we received salad which wasn't in the menu, then we asked the waitress if that came with the three course meal. She literally ran away. Then another one came to the table and starkly said: \"DON'T TOUCH.\". At that point we were very confused. Then another guy came and said that the salad was included. Whew! What a saga. The starters were good (the table got the linguica, calamaris and garlic shrimp) but nothing stellar. The entrees were OK. The salmon filling was tasteless, the mariscada was weird - the seafood and lobster tasted OK, the sauce was bland and had peas in it. It honestly tasted like frozen food. My wife ordered the housemade flan, which the waiter several minutes later asked \"ma'am did you order the flan?\" She said \"yes\" the guy burst out \"WE DON'T HAVE IT.\" Then she and my friend ordered the dulce de leche cheese cake - something else came, an undisclosed berry cheesecake. The creme brulee I ordered was meh.  I am never coming back to this place, especially when you look at the price tag ($30-$40 a plate).",

We ordered paella, chicken breast with creamy mozzarella sauce, stuffed chicken breast, calamari and portobello. The portion was really big that we weren't able to finish it and had to pack them home. The price is within a reasonable price, and they deliver your food out within a timely manner. The staff are nice and helpful with recommending dishes, they constantly came to my table and asked if the food was good. The reasons I am giving them a 3 start is that they assumed I speak Mandarin (I am an Asian) and they attempted to greet me in Mandarin. I found that offensive and rude. And also, when I eat slow, it doesn't mean that I am done, so DO NOT ask if I am finished eating and try to take my food away from my table. I am here to the restaurant to eat and relax and enjoy, not to shove food into my stomach and leave. Please, DO NOT assume all asian/ Chinese looking people are all from China and speak Mandarin.

I ordered two garlic shrimp appetizers, two soups of the day, and garlic chicken with rice. The service was pleasant and the bartender assisted with my order. The food was prepared in ~20 minutes and smell from the packaging was alluring.  The packing however was inappropriate and led to the sauce spilling throughout the box. Additionally, instead of using clear covers over the foil containers, white covers were used so it was impossible to quickly check to see if all food ordered had been packed and given to me. That's a rookie mistake an experienced restaurant shouldn't be making--it led to my rice being left out. I literally received chicken bathing in a ton of sauce and zero rice.   The soups had a very odd flavor. They consisted of kale, olive oil (Lord knows why) and a green broth. If the oil hadn't been there it would have been pleasant. The chicken was good but far too thin. The shrimp were okay but overcooked. And they packed two orders of shrimp into one container. Why? How did they know two different people wouldn't be eating the shrimp appetizers?   I would return to try dining at Mallorca. But I wouldn't do takeout again. They don't pack appropriately and seem to take liberties with take-out customers that they would not take with dine-in customers.",

The dessert tray came out ... it was tempting ... we all chose a sorbet.  The lemon sorbet was served in a lemon.  My mango was served in a halved mango and the watermelon was served on a huge slice of watermelon rind.   The almond liquer served at the end of the meal could easily become addictive.  I asked the owner about purchasing a bottle at the liquor store.  Apparently the label on the bottle changed and the LCB hasn't given it a new code.  I will add it to my future purchases list.

Everyone loved their meal! We also had bread, rice, salad, and vegetables that came with our meals. For dessert, there was an assortment of different cakes, including a delicious pomegranate cheesecake!  Our waiter, an older gentlemen whose name I think was Henri (may have heard it wrong!) was fantastic and funny. He was very attentive and made us laugh multiple times. We loved him!

    "text": "Always have received great service at Mallorca. Paella at its best. Many other Spanish style cuisine is offered on the expansive menu. But wait, its the daily specials that add even more to your decision making when selecting an entree! There is so much to consider, but if your not in the mood for the Paella, order a special.   This visit, the lobster was calling my name. So it was ordered. It was good, not the best I've had, but good none the less. Ask for the waiter to plate it for you to keep yourself from creating a mess. Paella was ordered by my son, who of coursed loved this featured staple here. The Portuguese steak and Osso Buco where the other selections in our party. Both were good, not fabulous, but just good.  Our appys consisted of the Portuguese sausage which comes \"flaming\" hot to your table, It was just OK, but really cool to watch as it cooks and is served table side. The octopus and stuffed seafood rellenos were just OK.   We enjoyed our dinner and was satisfied with our meal. If someone is in the mood for Spanish cuisine and wants great service, go here and choose the Paella. If you have a Groupon or it is Restaurant Week, this may be a viable option. If not, there are so many other places to explore in the Burgh with better food. Just my opinion.  Also, there is valet parking available in lot next door for those who may be concerned with the Southside parking issues.",

The entrees all came with a salad, yellow rice and vegetables. I had monkfish, and hubby had steak. The Diablo sauce on my fish was so delicious that my husband asked our waiter for more to put on his steak and rice. To our surprise, the kitchen maid extra sauce just for him.

    "text": "I was hoping for a much better experience. A couple of friends from Tampa announced they were in town this weekend. I scrambled to find a decent place for dinner on Saturday. Mallorca was one of the few choices I was considering that had openings in the timeframe we were looking. Reserving and confirming was simple.  Upon learning where we were eating, our guests looked up the restaurant and were put off by the \"weekend dress code\" statements as all they'd packed were shorts and tees. Turned out there were plenty of jeans and tees dining out there, but my guests were worried they wouldn't be welcome.   As to dinner itself, we had a problem with service and presentation more than the actual food. The list of \"specials\" didn't seem all that \"special\" but it was very, very long - like a dozen entrees from fish to chops and steaks. Prices not mentioned except for the last one at $75.  We were not under the impression that appetizers were \"family style\" - and maybe they're not, but they certainly are more than a normal human could/should be able to consume, and on very large plates for the size of a four-top. There were 5-6 stuffed peppers and 2-3 very large portabellas in those appetizer orders. Unfortunately our lady guest had ordered both of those as her meal and was totally embarrassed by the size of the plates and amount of food.  I ordered a whole snapper, which was to be \"filleted tableside\". This was horrible mislabeling of what actually happened. First a GIANT PLATTER was brought out with the fish on it. Then, instead of filleting tableside using one of those standard folding tables found in restaurants everywhere, the GIANT PLATTER was put on our table, with the waiter moving everyone else's stuff out of the way to fit this ginormous thing on our little table. I was beginning to feel like Mr. Creosote from Monty Python's Meaning of Life.  To make matters worse, the waiter had no clue how to fillet the fish. He used a standard dining service knife like the ones already on our table, not a fillet knife. As he was filleting on the GIANT PLATTER on our table right over my shoulder, he was intrusive to both myself and my guest to my immediate right. And he did a sloppy job, leaving a mess of bones which he was tediously trying to pick out one by one and taking forever while my dinner companions held off conversation while watching this disaster incredulously.  Finally I told the waiter I'd deal with the rest of the bones myself. There were so many left that it was hard to enjoy the meal. As we finished, there was still a ton of food left as the servings were huge (a practice both we and our guests abhor at a top-flight restaurant) and so we indicated we only wanted the peppers and my fish packed for takeout. But they insisted on packing everything - including the leftover shellfish from the paella, a side plate of yellow rice in addition to the rice from the paella, and the mushrooms, which were soaked in balsamic. They made sure to announce to the table that they packed every single thing into the five containers they were giving me to take home as my guests were staying at a hotel - a scene right out of Defending Your Life when Albert Brooks was unwillingly given a stack of pies to take home. Needless to say I chucked a bunch of it out soon as we got home.  And then it took the better part of a half hour to get the check. Neither of my guests drink, so the complimentary shots of whatever booze it was they were serving as a lagniappe were unwelcome.  My wife and I may go back because we enjoy Iberian food and there aren't many choices in Pittsburgh. But we'll never bring guests there again. It was uncomfortable and embarrassing for us.",

I underwhelmingly expected some small grilled little pieces with a lotus flower, a drizzle of reduction, and 2 little carrots, but.....it was the biggest portion I've ever seen of octopus and it was great!

    "text": "I've been to Mallorca a few times before, and I'll admit I always get the same thing, the Mariscada, because it is soo good! My most recent trip was on a Monday night with a 7:45 reservation. This place was PACKED. We were greeted by the hostess who told us they were backed up and it would be about a 20 minute wait so we could walk around or have a drink at the bar. We chose to walk around and came back about 15 minutes later and sat down like others who were waiting were doing. The hostess seemed to be really frazzled, but had no system of seating people who were there. There were quite a few couples waiting and when a table of 2 became available she asked what times both couples reservations were for. They both said 8. She then attempted to seat them as my boyfriend and I were sitting there waiting. The person was nice enough to offer up her seat to us as she'd heard me say we had a 7:45 reservation. The hostess apologized, but maybe a system of checking in (or calling names out instead of seating  the first person you see) would be helpful.  We were seated and someone came by and told us the specials. Am I the only person who has trouble remembering any of the specials they tell you? There are always like 10 told to you at rapid fire, I can never remember any that interest me.  I ordered Mariscada, the boyfriend ordered Paella. We were given a sourdough type bread and then a salad. Our orders came out not too much later, with veggies, fried potato chip like things, and Spanish rice. Veggies were nothing to write home about. But my entree is so delicious. I just love dipping bread in the rich tomato sauce.  My only problems really were with the seating problem and the lack of drink refills. I feel bad, because obviously the waiters work their butts off but our waters and sodas were empty more often than they were full. But, it was difficult to enjoy a great meal when I was constantly thirsty. Maybe our table wasn't in a good spot to see our glasses but when someone is running around refilling water, they should be able to see all tables.  After we received our check, we were given 2 shots, \"on the house\" which was a nice gesture, Not sure if the waiter felt bad or if this is normal. We also had a Steeler sighting at the bar, so that makes for a fun dining experience. We'll go back but hopefully won't experience a few of the kinks we had this time. \"",

The servers, host, runners all spoke unintelligible English, which fine a lot of ethnic leaning places don't, but they were so unapologetic about it/had about 6 different specials none of which written down and only rattled off by a completely uninterested...host?  I'm not sure, we had multiple people visiting our table and refilling water glasses and asking if we want more booze.  Should have taken them up on it....When our food finally came, it looked ok but had no discernible flavor and the textures were all wrong and way overcooked, crimes against catfish.  I don' t even know what it was we officially ordered but it sounded pretty good from the bits and pieces of the description.  Almost inedible though and for about 30 bucks a plate, how does a Spanish restaurant fuck up Spanish Rice? Couldn't wait to get out of there, not to mention the decor and carpeting badly need to be replaced or better yet just shut it down",

    "text": "My first visit to Mallorca was really quite nice.  I got a table outside on a lovely day, and besides one pestering fly and an over-zealous breeze, it was very pleasant.  I started with an appetizer of stuffed mushrooms.  The mushrooms were cooked very well (they were still solid, not overly done and mushy) and the stuffing had a nice taste although I found it to be a bit on the liquidy side.  For my meal I had the veal with mozzerella sauce.  It came out in an iron dish that had obviously come straight from the oven, and I had at least five pieces of veal swimming in a delicious cheese sauce that was slightly darkened on the top, which I loved.  The veal may have been sliiiightly overdone, but it had a very nice flavor and went with the sauce very nicely. The only minor complaint I have is that the service was a little inconsistent.  I arrived for dinner right at 5pm on a weekday with a friend, and we were two of possibly four total people in the restaurant at the time.  I guess the staff was feeling rather bored, because whenever we would need attention at our table, we were surrounded by a minimum of three servers.  Which was very attentive and I appreciated the service, although it did make me slightly uncomfortable.  But the really uncomfortable thing was whenever our servers were done helping us, they stepped back about three feet and just stood behind our table the entire time.  Now THAT was uncomfortable.  And slightly creepy.  But we got all of our food in a very timely manner, which was excellent.  But then as the restaurant started to fill up, we requested our bill, and ended up waiting about 20 minutes for it.  We figured they had forgotten about us, until the bill finally arrived and we realized it had been laying on top of the servers' station a few feet from us the entire time.  So they didn't forget about us, just the bill.   So although the service went from practically sitting on my lap to forgetting that we weren't trying to do a dine and dash, the food really was quite good and I'll definitely be back.",

Don't get me wrong, I love balsamic vinegar. I can just dip my bread in it plain but this was a very strong type and there was so much of it that I couldn't taste the mushrooms. As for the sea bass, I had asked for the olive oil drizzle to be removed and brought on the side (since in most restaurants in the Burgh, drizzle means drench) but it came with it anyways. When I complained, they took the fish and put it on a new plate with the olive oil scraped off. The sides that came with the entree were just sad. Some steamed veggies that tasted no different than steam in a bag grocery store variety and a bland rice with some peas.  The bill for these two plus one glass of wine was $55. I had a groupon but it was still way way overpriced for the quality. The only reason I am giving them two stars instead of one is I should have asked for the price of the specials. I just assumed that the price of the sea bass would at least be comparable to the grilled salmon, which was $21. I was wrong since it was $35 despite being  the size of my fist. I will not be going back to this place and I do not recommend this to anyone who values quality over quantity.",

    "text": "My latest trip to Mallorca was for a  good friend's birthday party. She had called the day of to make reservations and was able to get a table for 6. When I arrived, my husband and I were the first in our party. We were asked to wait in the small bar area for our entire party. This was rather annoying to me since the bar was righ by the entrance and other people kept coming in and bumping into us. The area was highly congested with the bar on one side, tables on teh other and a coat check a the end.  Not a good place to grab a relaxing drink before our meal. The drinks are fairly reasonably priced, $17 for two VERY large glasses of wine. Once our party arrived, we were seated. We decided to skip the appetizers and move right to the entrees knowing the portion sizes are large. The waiter read the 20+ specials, as usual. They must have the same specials for several days in a  row, otherwise no one would be able to remember all of those dishes. I ordered the filet and my husband ordered the paella. My filet was tender, juicy and cooked perfectly. As always, the table was served rice, veggies and chips family style as sides. The rice and chips were delicious but the veggies were a bit under done. The green beans were quite crispy, not in a good way. After dinner, we were trying to decide on dessert when our waitor, who had been short with us several times during our meal, heard that it was my friend's birthday and decided to bring the entire table chocolate cake. What a sweet gesture! :) I gave Mallorca 3 stars because a few hours after dinner, my husband started to not feel well. He had a bad headache and slept for 10 hours which is highly unusual for him. I also woke up with a headache which I think had something to do with their house wine, which was the only wine they had by the glass. I  never have headaches from wine, especially when I only have one glass. Next time, I will order a bottle.",

    "text": "This was our second visit to Mallorca and our last!  We both had food poisoning from this dinner. Projectile vomiting for hours. Horrible, more horrible than I thought possible. It took us 2 days to feel normal again. Aside from that being one of the worst feelings I've ever experienced and never wanting to even look at that place again, here is the rest of my review if you care to read.  Don't bother asking them questions about the wine list! 2 different people came to our table to try to help and neither had a clue about any of the wines. We ended up picking randomly. I will admit, the food is pretty tasty on the way down. Can't say the same on the way up. We had veal osso bucco and the grouper seafood special, then peach and mango sorbet for dessert. You can tell the waitstaff is trying but they need more wine education and  they tried to take away our plates about every 2 minutes while we were still eating. That's all.  Hey Mallorca-clean your kitchen.",

    "text": "Used to love coming here when I lived in Pittsburgh - great food, nice environment - paella, garlic shrimp - all of the spanish classics were great.  Haven't been here in some time - hope it is still as good as I remember.  Was a huge fan of the South Side in general - great festivals, bars, restaurants, german/polish restaurants, fun one-off shops, bakeries, great place to walk around, etc...  Last time I was back , it seemed to be a tale of two worlds on the South Side - some of the one-off local business looked like they were gone or suffering, and there was new development with retail chains that probably brought some new investment, but was a different character.  Was fairly early on a Saturday morning, so perhaps I did not see things as they typically are here - nonetheless , memories of a very good restaurant and the South Side/Carson Street.",

    "text": "Mallorca continues to be one of our favorite restaurants in the area. The service is fantastic. The restaurant is always vibrant and full, yet the servers are diligent in keeping guests happy.  I have dined at Mallorca at least a dozen times and never tire of the menu because of the ridiculously huge amount of specials they offer. Large portions that are always well-prepared describe the dinner entrees. Our group had the spicy mussels from the apps menu (awesome) and stuffed mushrooms that were good. They are stuffed with crab and shrimp and I don't like shrimp or would rate them higher. Veal with Mozzarella, Kobe Steak, Yellow Fin Tuna with pepper sauce and Chilean Sea Bass were our entrees. Each one was better than the others, although my favorite was the tuna.     Trust your server to recommend a wine as their list is pretty extensive. We enjoyed an 08 Llai Llai Pinot Noir that was quite nice and selected based on the server's recommendation.  We will go back again and again. Just love it",

    "text": "My first visit to Mallorca was 10 years ago, and it was quite memorable.  My cousins and I decided to try out the Spanish restaurant on a Friday night; without a reservation.  We arrived at 7pm sharp, and the place was buzzing.  The bar was full, and every seat in the joint was packed with hungry foodies.  The two of us decided to wait (we had heard such good things) and didn't want to chance going somewhere else.  We sat after half an hour, and ate (I can't remember what).  The only thing I do recall is the craziness that ensued.  The wait staff was running about feverishly, and the Maitre' D was filling his time by demeaning them in front of everyone.  We were also encouraged to leave after our meal was complete; there was, after all other people waiting to be seated. I left without the slightest interest in returning. Well, I did go back a few weeks ago for brunch, and the atmosphere was quite different.  The restaurant was quiet and clean, and the staff was accommodating.  As a matter of fact, we were in for an early lunch, and got royal treatment.  We ordered our drinks, and our waiter presented us with complimentary grilled hot peppers and stuffed mushroom caps.  The peppers were served as-is; no dipping sauce, just the char-grilled taste for us to enjoy.  The mushrooms were loaded with hot sausage, and browned.  They were delicious, just enough earthy flavor, and the sausage was spicy.  For lunch, I ordered the Pollo Marsala, (Chicken with Wine Sauce and Mushrooms $9.95), my lunch mate opted for the Paella Valencia, (Seafood, Chicken, and Spanish Sausage with Rice $16.95).  As we sipped our iced tea and mimosas, we noticed the restaurant getting busier.  The bus boys were hurried with their iced waters, dressed to the nines, wearing white pressed shirts and bow ties. Our meals arrived in 20 minutes and we dug in.  My chicken was moist and seared properly; brown not burnt.  The mushrooms were seared and tasty as they absorbed the sweet Marsala wine sauce made with lots of real butter.  The Paella Valencia was equally as good.  The shrimp were soft and tender, as was the chicken.  The rice and Spanish sausage was a nice accompaniment.  In between bites our server and busboy were attentive, filling our water glasses and clearing used dishes.  We had chocolate cake and mango sorbet for dessert; both were good, but I'm still not sure if they were made in-house.  Our meal was pleasant, and we were able to enjoy it at a relaxed pace without anyone rushing us out the door.  We had a great time at lunch, but its dinner that you have to experience. Some of the recommended offerings are: Calmar Frito (Lightly Breaded Fried Squid $9.95), Mellinoes in Salsa Verde (Mussels in Green Sauce ($9.95), Langosta Rellena (Broiled Stuffed Lobster with Crab Meat and Shrimp $34.95), Colas De Longosta Al Champagne (Twin Lobster Tails with Champagne Apple Sauce $35.95), and Camarones Enchiladas (Shrimp in a Lightly Spiced Tomato Sauce $22.95).  There is also a wide variety of specialty chicken and fish dishes prepared Mediterranean-Style.  If you're a vegetarian, there are also a wide variety of choices too. Authentic Spanish Cuisine...that's what Mallorca offers.  With its rich history, colorful employees, and fresh food, it's worth a visit.",

    "text": "Completely overpriced and totally underwhelming. That about sums it up. We had a girls night out and one of the ladies suggested Mallorca. I knew the bad rep Mallorca had (my husband and I ate here a few years ago and I have the same opinion now I had then) but I thought just maybe they have listened to the masses and changed their ways. Nope. Sorry to say they have not changed a thing.  I ordered one of the specials of the day, sea bass and I looooooooove sea bass. I can never turn down a good thick piece of that fish. One friend ordered the paella and the other gal ordered a dish I don't know the name of but it was a seafood dish with a few different types of seafood. But out first came the salad that had way too much dressing on it (dressing was totally meh). When my sea bass was delivered I was so incredibly disappointed. It was this teeny little flat square that had been seared with way too much oil (I had even asked that they skip the butter lemon sauce because instinctively I knew it would be swimming in it). It was totally greasy, yet at the same time undercooked. I didn't know that the sides were served family-style so I thought that was all I got but it wouldn't have mattered. The side of vegetables was totally greasy as well and not creative in the least. Totally bland. The rice is exactly as all the other reviewers have described: Rice a Roni meets Zatarains. Totally bland and  you cannot convince it didn't come from a box. My friend's paella was terrible. Bland, overcooked and soupy. My other friend didn't even eat half of her seafood meal. And the final straw was when I got my check and saw that they charged $39.95 for my fish. Wha???? Pah-lease. Those are the same prices as Wild Rosemary and their food is absolutely stupendous and worth every penny. So fresh, so creative. This was total junk and a meal I could have gotten for half the price at Max and Erma's, or even better yet, Eat-n-Park. It was so bad.  Yes, the service was great but who cares when you're so disappointed and angry about being so stooped on your meal?? I can't believe this place still gets business. And the service was actually a little annoying. The main server was great, but the assistant to the waiter came over at the end of our meal about 3 times asking us if we were finished and when we said no he just stood there looking at us like we just spoke greek. He clearly wanted us out of there.  Mallorca: I have no idea why you won't tap into the reviews here and use them to your benefit. You have gold here. People are telling you they want to go to your establishment if you'd only serve good food at reasonable prices. I don't think that's asking much.  I've now made 2 mistakes eating here. That won't happen again. Ever.",

I came here with a friend, looking for a place to have a nice conversation.  Surprisingly, it was loud and busy.  We walked in without a reservation on a Saturday evening, but still got a table within 20 minutes.  I had the seafood paella along with two appetizers and dessert.  My share came out to be $49 including tax and tip.  The paella was huge (it actually lasted for four extra meals without going bad).  The spicy chorizo was somewhat too much for an appetizer.  The flan was moist and good.  Recommended for Spanish food, but the price and the accompanying noisy atmosphere doesn't get this establishment five stars.",

Sides -- Came with vegetables (mostly brocolli/cauliflower which I ate), yellow rice (my fiance ate that) and potato chips - they looked OK but we didn't try them Dessert -- Didn't order any Service -- Friendly but not the most attentive. We dined on a Saturday night and the place was superbusy.  Deals/Discounts -- we used a Groupon..The deal was $12 for $25 worth of food, but because I bought my Groupon through my Iphone App for the first time, I got a $10 credit..ultimately $2 for $25  worth of food Overall -- only go on a slow night (not Saturday evening!) and if you have a Groupon or discount",

    "text": "I'm going to tell you the end of this restaurant horror story and then you can decide for yourself if you'd like to read the rest or have had enough.   Ready?  As my friend and I are exiting Mallorca, the manager, who is shoveling food into his face at the bar, turns and says \"Sorry for the trouble girls...\" and spits his food all over us.   Now, let's bring it back to the beginning, if you're so inclined.   Upon recommendations, a passion for Spanish cuisine and armed with a groupon, my  friend and I decided to try Mallorca last Saturday evening.   We were greeted by eager, formal wait staff and were promptly seated. The dining room was ugly, out dated, and several shades of dark puke green. The plaster had multiple holes and the wall paper was water damaged and peeling away.   Aesthetics aside, we ordered the Sangria right away from hearing wonderful things and we were not disappointed.  For an appetizer we ordered the special that day, octopus. It arrived quickly. It wasn't bad. I've had better, but it tasted fresh and seemed to be carefully prepared and the presentation was eye catching.   For our main course, I badly desired the Paella Valencia. As a long time fan of Spanish/South American culinary specialties, I was dying for a good paella!   Our Paella Valencia arrived quickly. Excited about the paella, we barely noticed the small dish of random vegetables and the dish of potato chips they placed on the table (ummm thanks... how classy...and authentic...). As we scooped paella onto our plates and eagerly began to dig in, I barely had time to fully absorb the blandness of the dish when I noticed a man's HAIR pressed into my chorizo.   I flagged over the bus boy who was leaning miserably against the wall.  \"Hi, um, I have a hair in my Paella.\" Bus boy: \"Oh! Um. Let me get your waiter.\"  Our waiter promptly marched over and began collecting all of our dishes. I tried to speak to him, \"I'm extremely surprised to find this hair in the food.\" Waiter in his strong accent, \"Yes, ma'am, disappointing. But these things happen.\"  Wait. What?  \"Yes, I realize these \"things\" can happen, but it shouldn't, not in this fine restaurant.\" But he was gone before I could fully defend myself.  Then we waited. And waited. And waited. No one came out to apologize. No one asked us if we needed anything.   So I flagged the bus boy over again.  \"Hi, is your manager around?\"  Bus boy: \"Yes.\"   Pause.  \"Do you want me to get him?\" No. I just want to know where he is.  Me: \"Um. Yes, please get him.\"  The manager visits us for the first and ONLY time. He greets us with a look that says \"What do you want?\" I explained our little problem to him.   Manager: \"These things happen. \" Seriously? SERIOUSLY?  Me: \"Look, your restaurant comes highly recommended. I had high expectations and did not expect to find a hair in my paella...\"  Practically interrupting me he continues \"Yes, we have a fine restaurant. I have been in the business many years. These things just happen.\" Me (getting annoyed now with the lack of apology): \"Do they wear hair nets in the kitchen?\" Manger: \"Yes, of course. Besides, we have no women in the kitchen.\"  SERIOUSLY?   Not only is that SEXIST, I had to inform him that is was NOT  a woman's hair, but rather a short black hair that turned gray on the end, much like his own hair, and that it was PRESSED INTO MY CHORIZO WHICH I SCOOPED OUT OF THE PAELLA FROM UNDER RICE.   But, he clearly didn't want to hear it and walked away mumbling something that sounded like \"I'm disappointed.\"   Then our second paella arrived.   Our waiter apologized (finally) for the hair, only to proceed to tell us that \"This can happen easily. You could lift up your napkin and a hair could fall in.\"  Ugh...Am I out of line to hope and expect that wouldn't happen? Is there some ninja going around and hiding hair all over the restaurant? Do you have a shaggy dog folding your napkins?   The lobster, scallops, tiny micro sized shrimp all tasted the same: bland, frozen, overcooked, boring. The rice had no flavor and looked remarkably like the boxed paella rice that Goya sells. The chicken was dangerously undercooked- hard and pink. Needless to say, we had no appetite after all of this.   It wasn't hard to flag my actual waiter over this time. He had been standing in a corner ten feet away from our table with other waiters staring and pointing at us and talking about us in Spanish. Even if the paella was decent, we couldn't eat it while being stared at.  Waiter \"Would you like me to box this?\" Me: \"No. Just the check.\"  With a surprising twist, our waiter returned and informed us that this delightful meal would be on the house and then presented us with two shots of some sweet liquor.   We left our waiter a rather generous tip and got up to leave, feeling slightly vindicated.   We were chatting about the possibility of returning, when we met our manager at the bar on our exit...  Mallorca, you finally blew it when your manager blew his food on us.",

As many of the other reviewers mentioned. the sangria is excellent, very refreshing and works with most of the entree choices.  We tried the garlic soup - yummy, except that poached egg thing still is a little freaky to me, and the calamari with prociuttio, which was excellent, especially considering I'm not much of a calamari fan (it's a texture thing for me!).  A few of us had the beef - filet or the Delmonico, both were huge and tasty.  Our niece, who indeed had been to Mallorca before, had the halibut with spinich and pine nuts.  She said she enjoyed it, but though the tilapia entree was even better.   Coffee and dessert was also very good.    Service was a little slow to start, but was very good throughout the meal.  This place apparently packs them in, especially on weekends, so make reservations!  Parking is a little tricky in Southside, but Mallorca had valet - definitely use it otherwise you'll be driving around forever.  I would definitely visit Mallorca again when we're in Pittsburgh!",

Must say the service was superb, we were sat immediately, we were not smothered but at no time had to wait when we needed something and once we ordered the food came in a timely fashion. We ordered the Linguica as an appetizer and it was very good, having it flamed table-side was a great plus. I ordered the paella and it was much more than I could eat and packed with a nice variety of seafood plus chicken and sausage. Other food ordered at the table was very well prepared as well. Will definitely be going back on future trips and highly recommend it.",

We over ordered, getting lobster bisque (soup of the day), calamari stuffed with prosciutto, and garlic shrimp as appetizers, then a wagu porterhouse, trout stuffed with crabmeat, and a seafood pasta- all to share among 4 people. The entrees come with Spanish rice (similar to what you might see in paella), steamed veggies, and house baked chips to share as well - so we had more than enough. Service was good, and they gave us side salads and almond liquor shots on the house. I liked that it wasn't dimly lit, which I feel like is common at most restaurants for dinnertime, so we could actually see each other.   Slightly disappointing if you're looking for a traditional tapas place, but otherwise great.",

The atmosphere in the main dining room was very loud and it seemed as they tried to cram as many tables as possible into the space. Our appetizer was never brought out and we were changed for it. We waited for an hour for our food. It was delicious when we finally received it but the wait was painful. The server later explained that because it was St. Patrick's day there was two call offs and that makes sense. I believe that because my date and I are younger we were not given as good of service. I expected more from this restaurant and I will not be returning.",

The calamari, the stuffed mushrooms, and one of the stuffed peppers. We loved them all.  I had the special, wild boar shank. It Was cooked tender and in served in a great sauce.  My daughter in law had the Bife  Portuguese.  It Was cooked to.perfection. my wife had the halibut. They were very attentive to my daughter in law food allergies too.

The area inside is in desperate need of style updates. The food was very basic and plain. I ordered paella, and was so underwhelmed and disappointed. The rice tasted like it came from a store bought package, they added water and threw it in a microwave. The peas on top were given the same treatment. Dessert was just ok.

My most recent trip we sat at the bar for the first time and had a great experience. The bartender, Jay, was super friendly and attentive. We ordered the garbanzo beans, the cheese & fruit plate, and the crispy potatoes. All great choices for tapas! (The potatoes actually aren't crispy, but they are still good!) A pitcher of sangria and the rum cake made for a full meal (we were stuffed with this amount of food!)  Here are my tips:  Must have: Red Sangria! The pitcher is our go-to and really is delicious!  Consider: My favorite meal is the chicken cannelloni, the Spanish rice & veggies (that come with every entree) is great! Dessert: you can't go wrong - but I never have room for it! Tapas: the cheese and fruit plate is sizeable, be sure you have enough people to tackle it!  The patio is lovely - even through the fall it's a great outdoor area for dinner! They have the patio, a few areas of dining rooms, and the front bar area - so all people can find a place to please them!  At the end of every meal they give you a shot of almond liquor - enjoy!   For those out-of-towers (aka not walking through the SS), remember that they have free Valet Parking (so bring your cash for a tip).",

They listed the specials but the list was super long so I wish there was a printed copy or at least somewhere where the specials were listed. The table we sat at broke...a portion of it broke up and we realized that portion was held by duct tape...we told the staff and they very quickly brought us to a new table.   My one other complaint was that when one of the servers was putting the plates down, one of them was dirty and still had a piece of salad on it...he got rid of it quickly but it was still something I noticed.   Onto the food! You get a salad with you dinner meal, as well as some bread for the table. I ordered the ravioli stuffed with lobster with white sauce, and let me tell you, ITS AMAZING!!!! It was soooo good! I literally devoured it. Entrees also come with rice, fried potatoes, and vegetables served family style, which I thought was really nice. The flan was meh but the creme brulee was yummy!   Service was also fast and friendly.   The place is pricey, but I really enjoyed my food and experience.",

Most things in the paella were nice, including two big scallops, numbers of shrimps and shellfish. But again it was quite bland. A half of small lobster and a mussels had a very strong oder. The waiter explained, and made us new pieces of lobster. But sadly, the new ones were as dry as chewing a rubber band. They also served us crazy amount of side dishes including fresh potato chips(which was good), very dry carrot or some sort of orange rice, and extremely oily vegetables.  I think in general, they have decent quality materials, but they really should hire a better chef. In addition, they may be able to save quite a bit of money by cutting down the amount of side dishes.",

The inside decor looks super dated and just crammed. When you walk back to the bathrooms you have to pass through a hallway of stacked up chairs. They hand write their checks so we had to wait 20 plus minutes to get our check..but again the staff is very friendly and courteous and we also got a shot of amaretto at the end. Some of the servers also sing which is nice. Overall it was good food and decent service but the drawbacks don't leave me running to return at this price point. I'd probably come back but not anytime soon.",

It was  a Dolce de Leche cheesecake. My mom said her flan was great!",

    "text": "We hadn't been to Mallorca in a long time, so we gave it a shot as we used to enjoy it.  HUGE MISTAKE. Terrible amateur service.  Foreign objects in food. Crazy prices for specials. No apologies. We had to wait in the very crowded bar area for over half an hour for our reservation.  Wine glasses were brought to the table still wet with water drops all over the glasses (not dried).  The waiter never re-poured and never brought a chiller as asked (we were outside on the patio, as it was the only table available, and the wine just got too hot). FYI, wine prices at 3 to 4 times retail doesn't help either.   As we were eating the appetizers they tried to serve salad (I had to shoo them away).  Then after salads were cleared, it took 45 minutes to get entrees.  ?? My daughter's paella had a large piece of plastic in it.  The waiter said \"it was just a piece of sausage casing\".  Are you kidding me?  No other explanation.  No price adjustment.  My son-in-law ordered Chilean Sea Bass which was a special.  We never asked the price and I was a bit surprised that it was $48.  In Pittsburgh...really??  My wife ordered the stuffed twin lobsters and each lobster came with only one claw.  When asked, the waiter said that is how they balance the weight, by removing one claw.  What??  Who cannot order 1 14 or 1  1/2 pound lobsters from their purveyor?  Total BS. In fairness, the garlic shrimp and stuffed calamari appetizers were good.  My mariscada was OK, as was the sea bass.  The lobsters tasted fine as was the paella (sans plastic).  Generally good, but not any better than that, and expensive for poor service and average food.",

    "text": "I hadn't been to Mallorca in a few years. It wasn't that I didn't like it anymore, it was that my wife and I don't get dressed up and go out like we used to. Plus, I was worried that Mallorca might have been slipping- I was used to a quality Spanish restaurant with overattentive service, delicious food, and a romantic ambiance. However, it seems like every other day, there is a new Groupon or half-off deal for Mallorca, which was giving me a red flag that something was wrong.  A recent visit proved me wrong. The food is just as good, the portions are huge, and the European class is still there.  If you've never been to Mallorca, part of the charm of this restaurant are the different rooms. Each room has a different decor, with lots of woods, colorful tiles, drapes, interesting stained-glass, and tablecloths and linens. The best way to describe the service is that everyone in the restaurant is like the butler from Mr. Deeds (I'm very, very sneaky). They have intoxicating accents, are dressed in formal wear, and usually swoop in two or three at a time to set tables, serve drinks, and place your food. If you're not ready for it, it can seem jarring, but at Mallorca it's all part of the Spanish charm. As for the food, the Spanish cuisine can't be beat in Pittsburgh. Here, Spanish doesn't mean tacos and burritos, but continental cuisine like fresh seafood, veal, and steaks, and they have a laundry list of specials like suckling pig, roasted duck, lamb, and other exotic dishes that they read off in a thick Spanish accent that is a show in itself. Each entree comes with bread, salad, rice, vegetables, and homemade chips- you will not go hungry at Mallorca. My favorite apps are their calamari or roasted sausage, which comes on a sizzling plate. For dinner, I enjoy the paella, which is filled with seasoned rice, scallops, shrimp, chorizo, clams, mussels, chicken, and a bunch of other stuff that tastes really good together. It comes in a giant steamer pot, so be prepared to take some home. My wife defaults to the Mariscada En Salsa Verde, which is a bunch of seafood cooked in a yummy green sauce. For dessert, we like their flan, although we rarely make it to dessert with all the food we end up taking home. Also, make sure you wash it all down with their homemade sangria, which is thick with alcohol and chunks of fruit, or check out their extensive wine list.  Mallorca is a great place for a romantic dinner, celebration, or if you just like good Spanish continental cuisine and rolling R's..",

    "text": "Mallorca lived up to its reputation in my book.  We felt welcomed from the moment we stepped in to the very end when the owner shook our hands and thanked us for coming.   The service staff was very friendly, knowledgeable and there for your every need.  We started off with their homemade red sangria and Shrimp Bisque...both of which are not to be missed!  The Sangria has just the right mix of fruity flavor and alcohol.  They were also very good and making sure your glass was more than half full.  For dinner, we ordered one item from the menu, Lobster Ravioli and three from the daily specials; Rack of Lamb, Swordfish and the Bone in Prime Rib.  Each plate was better than the last!  Everything was cooked perfectly and the flavors were close your eyes when you take a bite good.  The Bone in Prime Rib arrived at the table and you felt as if you were in the opening scene of the Flintstones...it was HUGE!  We laughed when our waiter told us that this was the \"small\" cut.  The family style sides of saffron rice, hand-made chips and steamed veggies were all very tasty.  They were not only generous with the portions but willing to refill anything that we finished.   The prices were not cheap - but the quality of food tied with the experience of being there made it very worth it.   I think the only disappointment was that some of the patrons were dressed really casual.  I know that is a personal thing that makes me sound like a snob, but seriously, this restaurant is more of an event than just somewhere to grab a \"bite\".  It didn't change my experience but I noticed it.   I certainly plan to return in the very near future.  If you are looking for somewhere special to go where the food is wonderful, the service will make you smile and you will remember your meal for a long time. Well done Mallorca. Well done!!",

Both of us were quite pleased with everything and would definitely recommend.   The service was SUPERB. The server was extremely knowledgeable about the dishes; everything from ingredients to how it is prepared. My friend ordered the steak  and to be honest it wasn't the best cut and was slightly dry, as well it didn't come with the gorgonzola as advertised however she was still pleased. I went with the sea bass and was delighted. Warning, they bring around a dessert tray at the end so if you don't plan on ordering dessert, don't look directly at it (we clearly broke down and ordered the gluten free coconut lime mango mousse concoction).   The only downside was that my friend is gluten free and all of the sauces contain flour so she couldn't have any with her steak. It's too bad they couldn't offer a substitute or make a GF one on the fly.  All in all we enjoyed our evening and would suggest to others.",

Most of the items we were served were not freshly prepared, our bread, vegetables, rice and chips all looked and tasted like they came out of a store bag, had been left out and were brought to us at room temperature.  The main dishes were okay, but not particularly well prepared, and weren't worth the high $30-$40 entree prices.  Mallorca is a beautiful place, particularly with their oudoor patio.  They have alot going for them, but at least, based on our meal, this restaurant is missing the high end food to go with it's high end staff, prices and ambiance.",

The service was quick (dinner on thurs, with 20+ people) , sangria, wine, and bread were at the table before we even sat down. Then the appetizers started coming out, my favorites were garlic shrimp and spanish sausage. The green pepper one was ok but a good choice for vegetarians.   Then came the main course accompanied a house salad with a nice, spicy dressing. We had some choices: pasta, fish, steak, veggie + sides of saffron rice and chips. I went with the steak, it was HUGE and topped with cheese and mushrooms. I got it medium-rare, it was nice and juicy, maybe the fat could've been trimmed some more.  For dessert, I had rum cake and coffee and some odd tasting sweet liquor. They have valet parking and a small parking lot next to the restaurant, pretty convenient. Great restaurant overall, I'm curious to try the paella to see how it compares to SF",

    "text": "I've been dining regularly at Mallorca since they opened, about twenty years ago. The menu is expansive, and I always opt for something different.  I've never been disappointed, as the food consistently excellent. The service is very attentive.  It's usually a more entertaining experience if you get one of the veteran waiters, who often display some good natured showmanship.  Just listening to them recite the long and detailed list of daily specials is part of the fun.  They don't mention the price when offering the specials though, so if this is a sensitive area for you, I suggest you ask and avoid a surprise.   Most recently I've been there for lunch, which I would suggest is the \"hidden jewel.\"  Known for their large dinner portions, the lunch portions amount to what would be a typical dinner portion at most full service restaurants.  But, the price is obviously much lower than the dinner menu.  Chances are, that even with the lunch portions, you may be taking home some leftovers if you've already filled up with some of their incredible appetizers or the quite nice fresh Portuguese style bread.   One could easily visit Mallorca and dine \"Tapas\" style by ordering only from their wide and delicious selection of appetizers.  If you are part of a group of three or more, you won't go wrong by ordering the appetizer sampler platter. {This is NOT listed on the menu, but should be!}  It's not cheap ($30 something, if I recall correctly) but it is HUGE and has a broad variety, each one better than the next.  I don't like the way they prepare the vegetables, as they are \"par cooked.\"   While this may be healthier and retain the vitamins, etc, I simply like my vegetables fully cooked.  Yet, this is such a minor point, as there is so much food served that eating the vegetables might consume valuable stomach real estate.  So.....sorry Mom, I'm going to pass on the veggies.  Unless, you count potatoes as a vegetable, which is technically correct (but not what Mom had in mind), and then you may enjoy the home made potato chips.  They are sliced thick and fried freshly in the kitchen, and are not to be confused with the product of the same name found bagged in retail stores....as there is no comparison.   The sangria is excellent.  The desert tray is filled with delectable options, including a wonderful almond torte, and a selection of natural frozen fruit sorbets, that are served in the frozen skin of the fruit itself.  Lastly, unless you are on a hot date, I strongly suggest the Garlic Soup, which features a fried egg floating about the rich broth.   I dine out frequently, and tend to migrate to different places to explore, but this is one that has remained a \"regular visit\"  on my circuit.",

    "text": "So first of all, let me preface this by saying, I always have a good time in Pittsburgh. It's just like magic. I show up, I have a great time, and I owe it all to the Steel City's... I dunno... jeu ne se quois?! So, the best of times are when I find something ELSE that I love as much as Pittsburgh in the city of bridges. Found: Mallorca.  Spanish culture, language, food, music and I, well we get along well.  I was super excited to find a Groupon for Mallorca, as it is a classy little spot, but a bit out of my normal price range for a casual Saturday night out. I don't know if it was subliminal messaging or sentiment remaining from my vacation in Spain, but I was a woman on a mission: Sangria, Paella. End of sentence. Mallorca is a white table cloth place, and they take your coat at the door-- keepin' it classy. We ordered a pitcher of Sangria and shared the house Paella. I wasn't dazzled by the shared dish charge, but we just weren't hungry enough to put down much more than the Paella dish alone.  I can't say the food was so authentic it took me right back to the streets of Las Ramblas where I had my first authentic Paella, but it was good, and far better than what I have seen turned out by zealous would-be chefs that I call friends. There was plenty of flavor, and the seafood was cooked well. The dish was accompanied by some steamed veggies, and you'd think it's hard to mess up steamed veggies, but my friends I have seen it done and Mallorca did not disappoint.  I saw a lot of what looked like special celebrations and romantic, intimate dates happening all around us, and I thought that was charming. The service would get five stars if it stood on it's own, and although we passed on dessert, the selections looked enticing.  If you get a chance to go to Mallorca, I recommend going all out. My next trip will be more of a three-course experience.",

Although the service was very attentive and friendly and the portions are huge, the food just sucks.  The shrimp is a bit questionable.  I had bacon wrapped shrimp as my main course and the bacon was soggy, which made the meal disgusting.  Moreover, the meal comes with a side of boiled vegetables (which is a throw away as they lack seasoning/flavor) and a side of \"Spanish\" rice, which I think is really Goya Mexican rice seasoning thrown onto rice.  I personally would not go back...unless there are major changes to the quality of food.",

But we had some questions about the specials but as he said the last word, he walked away! But eventually he returned and we asked our questions and placed our order. That was at 7:15pm. We got our salads right away but at around 8pm, we asked our waiter what was taking so long. \"Two more minutes,\" he said. Twenty minutes later it arrived. I had ordered the asparagus ravioli which came over cooked and my husband's paella was soggy. But we had tickets to a show and there was no time to ask them to fix it, and besides, the waiter didn't bother to ask if everything was okay. They offered us free dessert but we didn't have time after having to quickly eat our dinners, but we asked for them to compensate us in some other way instead. They refused. Only go there if you want poor service, long wait times for substandard food, and a manager that couldn't care less. The good part? Good mints at the door.",

In fact, the service was one thing I always liked about Mallorca because it was always very attentive and professional. I recently dined there with my family to celebrate a birthday. While we sat down and were deciding what to order for appetizers and drinks, the server seemed very impatient. His attitude continued until we ordered our entrees. The calamari arrived and was extremely chewy to the point of being inedible. My husband complained to our server about the quality of the calamari. He quickly became very annoyed and irritable. He wanted to know what we'd like instead. Being that we had 5 people in our party, I asked him how many shrimp were included in the shrimp appetizer. He also seemed annoyed by my question and gave me an abrupt answer. After this, he disappeared and we never saw him again until later when we left the restaurant and saw him sitting on the sidewalk smoking a cigarette. Obviously, he was having a bad night, but it's a shame his poor service and attitude had to put a damper on our evening. It makes me reluctant to recommend this restaurant given the poor service we experienced on this visit.",

However, the service did not falter one bit.  We ordered soft shell crabs for an appetizer and I wish I had gotten it as a dinner.  It was perfect.  I had a full fish for dinner, and although very good, it wasn't boned and I had to ask to get it boned, but even then it had loads of bones and was almost scary to eat.  My husband had the steak that was incredible!  We could easy have shared it.  The salad was great, the vegetables good (but I would have liked some Spanish olive oil for them as they were plain.  But everything we asked for, they brought with no problem.  Wonderful food.",

    "text": "Stopped for tapas and drinks with my wife recently.  We were in Barcelona a few months ago and were really craving some authentic Barcelona type food.  Although it is not exact, I think Mallorca is about as close as you can get.  We ordered a cheese plate and the patatas bravas.  The cheese plate was very good, however I wish they would have provided more crostini's.  They also could have thrown in a softer cheese to mix things up.  The patatas bravas definitely reminded me of Barcelona, as this was a dish we had almost every day.  However, I wish they would have gone a little lighter on the red sauce.  The best ones we had in Spain topped the potatoes with both the red sauce and aioli with the right amount that they would not get soggy.  These ones just sat in the red sauce and were very soggy by the end.  I wish we could have eaten a full meal here, however after all the cheese and potatoes, we were full.  Next time we will definitely try their dinner options as they sounded and looked delicious.",

I also felt a little ignored by our server. I came with 1 other person, so a table of 2, and I felt like the servers kept passing by us to check in on larger parties. It took us a long time to get someone's attention just to ask for the check, and then even longer for the check to come (the restaurant was pretty empty by that point)  I had the veggie paella, which was made with quinoa rather than rice. I really liked the concept! The main flavor in the dish was garlic, which I wasn't a huge fan of, but if you love garlic, it could be for you!  I feel like this place might be better under different circumstances - with a larger party out for a celebration",

I definitely like eating on the patio in the spring and summer months.  They have an extensive menu and then many specials. The waiters run down the specials by heart and it's delicious just listening. I have enjoyed everything I've ordered over the years from octopus to steak to shrimp to salad to pasta...all delicious and well thought out recipes. The portions are very large-so come hungry. My go to dish on the menu is the garlic shrimp. It's not just a dish with 6-7 shrimp; it's a dish with at least a pound of shrimp. The sauce is amazing.   Each dish comes with salad, housemade potato chips, rice and veggies. Personally-I just love their salad dressing.  Certainly don't forget a drink or two.They have housemade sangria (red and white). Both are very good. I prefer the red more than the white.   When you go, tell Antonio I sent you!!",

    "text": "Amazing Service. Amazing Staff.   The menu in print is extensive. However, be warned not to finalize your decision until you've heard the specials. I'm not sure how often the specials change or if only certain staff members get to \"recite\" the specials, but there are several. It is also impressive watching the staff list the specials, answer questions about the specials, and then repeat the ones that are of interest.   My party consisted of six so we were able to try a large variety of their dishes. My sister and her fiancee had been here several times before and spoke highly of the restaurant. It did not disappoint.   Appetizers: Seafood Stuffed Mushrooms - this was okay. I'm not sure if I could distinguish the items in the seafood stuffing. It was very mushy and just kind of blah over the mushrooms. I was thinking this would be my favorite of the two appetizers we chose. However, I was wrong. I liked the other much better! Brandy-Flaming Sausage - I didn't expect to like this. We ordered it really so we could watch the flames and see the \"show.\" Oddly, this was amazing. The sausage seems house-made. It's definitely unique. I LOVED it!   Salads/Sides: Everyone who orders an entree gets the following.  Salad - A salad mix with a drizzle of French dressing. Nothing special but it is refreshing and I enjoyed the addition of fresh cracked pepper.  Rice - It's a nice saffron/yellow rice. Well-seasoned. Be warned that if you order the paella it's the same rice with seafood added. If you don't want too much rice, get the seafood medley which just has seafood and no extra rice. Vegetables - It's nice to have. We took it home. At the restaurant, I did not have room in my tummy for this item.  House Made Chips - I don't know why you get this. However, I LOVE that they give you this. I will always choose chips over fries. I love housemade chips. I ate every crumb.   Gorgonzola Steak - Loved the mushroom and the sauce over the steak. Perfectly cooked. Great dish.  Seafood Medley - SO MUCH seafood. Impressed that there were little baby lobsters included. Since you get the side of rice, you make your own paella. This seems to be a much better option if you love seafood and want more of it.  Lobster Ravioli - This was a special and it felt like a rich, creamy specialty. It included bits of lobster and a delicious sauce. I rarely finish my entree and I ate all of this one.  Veal Shank - This was a special as well. The meat was super tender and it came with TWO large chunks of meat. Delicious and served on a bed of penne pasta.   At the end, my group was super stuffed. We took a good amount of food home and did not have room to look at dessert. It was a lovely evening with great food set in an \"old-world\" setting. Will definitely return.",

    "text": "Mallaorca has become my go to \"night-out\" resturant. The pricey fare is well worth it when all of your entrees come with salads, rice, chips, and steamed vegetables! I am never disappointed. The best deal is during restaurant week when you can try three courses for 22 at lunch or 35 at dinner.   The first time I visited I tried: Garlic shrimp and the flaming chorizo. If I did it again I'd pick the shrimp. It has more sauce and lots of garlic bits and generally more flavorful. The pork is quite the spectacle though and worth a try.   For entrees, I have tried the filet migon, the seafood paella, and the special lemon caper sea bass. All good, the filet is good to try during restaurant week. It's a little expensive, so you get a bigger bang for your buck during the specials.  The seafood paella is good too, but you do get A LOT of Spanish rice and it's the same rice you get with the sides - buyer be warned. I personally like the leftovers and take it all home with me.  The vegetarian kale quinoa paella  is my favorite. A little oily, but its from all of the roasted garlic and love that goes into it. Some of the best quinoa I have had.   Dessert wise - the flan and creme brulee are creamy with notes of vanilla and the caramels are an even light to dark brown. No burnt flavors at all!   Tiramisu though, is my favorite dessert and they do a good job soaking the cake/lady fingers in espresso.   Service, atmosphere,and overall experience is top notch and I love LOVE coming here.",

    "text": "I remember when Mallorca's was THE place to go to take your date for an impressive dinner. That was 15 years ago and those days are long gone.   My husband and I came to the South Side to stay at the Morning Glory Inn on Sarah Street. I'm from the area but moved 50 miles north of Pittsburgh several years ago. I remembered that Mallorca's was a pretty swanky place to go for dinner and I wanted the night to be special so we made a reservation. There was no need to, there were plenty of empty tables when we got there at 7.   The service was impeccable; we were waited on hand and foot. The redheaded woman with the eyebrow ring was very professional and hospitable. We did not order an appetizer because we stopped at the sushi place a block away while we were waiting for our reservation time and we ordered a maki roll to tide us over. We ordered from the specials menu- husband got the roasted wild boar and I got the duck l'orange. The mixed greens salad served before the main course was fresh and crisp. The entrees were meh. The duck was served with a scoop of INSTANT mashed potatoes. I was almost insulted that a 35 dollar entree even shared plate space with it. The \"wild boar\" was underwhelming and served with a smattering of canned beans in an unidentifiable sauce.   The sides were not worth touching- the rice was instant and did not have much flavor, the broccoli was rubbery and didn't have a grain of seasoning, and the potato chips tasted like a funnel cake.   We were very disappointed in our meal. We were expecting the same flair and exotic Spanish cuisine that the restaurant was known for back in the late 90s and early 2000's. Now it's bland, tasteless, and unimaginative.   It's so sad to see this once magnificent establishment lose it's former glory. We will not be returning, not for the tasteless and sloppy budgeted food for high dining prices.",

    "text": "3.5 really, but I rounded up for friendly staff and management.  Mallorca is one of those places that hasn't really changed in decades, but has a old-style vibe that works.  It starts when you come in the door.  Everyone greets you with a genuinely friendly and welcoming attitude.  It seems like a family place (don't know whether it is or not) and a fair bit of the staff have accents to match the place (always a good sign).    On to the food.  I sampled from my table's orders actually found the food to be middling to good, which is why my rating was what it was.  Nothing was terrible, but I don't think I had anything great either.  The portions were humongous.  I ordered two appetizers as my meal and had leftovers.  Everyone who ordered entrees had leftovers as well.  The best thing I ate was the tiramisu.  In fact, the desserts got kudos all the way around.     Service was team style and I think we had 4-5 people doing various things for our table of 6.   The server who recited the specials was impressive - a long list with many details there.  We didn't want for anything except our checks at the end.   It took a really long time to get the checks, which did sort of put a damper on an otherwise fun evening.    In the end, I'd go back, but I wouldn't pick it.  It was a pretty expensive meal for not having any dish really stand out as amazing.",

Hey, I wanted to try something different: which leads me to my only \"issue.\" Although the dishes were expertly prepared and wonderful (although this was my last attempt at trying to like octopus), I would have liked to have tried more: seafood stuffed mushrooms, pickled anchovies, etc. but the portion was huge! I was lucky to finish the two tapas I ordered! tapas in Spain are sold one at a time, the idea being to try a variety, not stuff yourself with just a couple! Maybe things are different in Portugal...  Regardless, I could not refuse Flan, which came with a nice scoop of caramel on the side. Very well done!",

    "text": "We arrived and the old school look was very pleasing and the welcome was refreshing. There was plenty of wait staff that were phenomenal at their jobs. You never had a dirty plate sitting in front of you nor an empty drink. Attention to service was exceptional. Our waiter was outstanding in both his welcoming to our party and the recitation of the specials and menu items from memory. The food was mediocre. The pitcher of Sangria we had was weak with a lot of added sugar I suspect. The salad was fresh and the house dressing was good but the amount of dressing should be decreased. Not a major dtractor.  The Camarones al ajillo which I have enjoyed elsewhere for years were not memorable. They were small warmed up shrimp not grilled and served in a dish with oil and garlic. No roasted pepper and the garlic was jarred and not fresh.  The Paella Diablo was flavorless. The rice needed something even just a pinch of salt. No flavor. The chicken was overcooked, hard, and had no seasoning. The shrimp were the same from the appetizer. Small and not seasoned. The chorizo tasted ok and would have been better if not overcooked. When I ordered I asked that it be made more \"Diablo\". I I was assured that it would be and that there is also some extra peppers in there I can cut up to make it spicier. There was one half jalapeno, one Chipotle, and some bell pepper. There is no spiciness or heat to it so I asked for something to spice it up. They recommended Tabasco or crushed red pepper flakes. If I was having a taco or a slice of pizza I would have agreed but this was supposed to be an authentic Portuguese restaurant. When I told them I don't think those two spices would be appropriate for this dish they brought out a leftover sauce from lunch which they said was very spicy but was simply a salsa with some cilantro. This place has everything going for it except for the food. If they were to spruce up their preparation and ingredients I would be willing to try again but not until I've seen reviews to support this.",

I often avoid Restaurants that claim to be Spanish because they lack the  True Spanish flavor and authenticity- Mallorca does not disappoint at all.   Im vegan and gluten free and was able to have the most amazing meal- the complimentary accompaniments were surprising because we are in the states but were also delicious-   The quinoa paella worried me initially- they don't use rice because the rice they use for their paella is already made with seafood stock- so the vegetarian version uses quinoa- the taste was amazing, and totally on point with vegetarian paella I've had in Spain that used rice.   The staff is so courteous and polite- I spoke to them in Spanish ( the ones who spoke Spanish) and they seem to really appreciate it- but don't worry if you don't- the level of respect and hospitality doesn't change. We showed up randomly not knowing it was a more upscale place- they didn't bat an eye at our jeans and t shirts, which I love because many fine dining establishments have dress codes and would turn you away if you come in so underdressed. This is True hospitality. You will not be disappointed!",

I could barely eat more than a few bites of it. The pork was dry and bland, and the sauce did not do anything to help. (Brought it home and gave it to the boyfriend.) Luckily, there were some potato chips on the table, so that saved me from being hungry. I did try my friend's paella though and it was fine.   Still, great service (a very lively \"happy birthday\" sung to my friend, among other things), and I enjoyed the cozy and inviting atmosphere of the restaurant. Just wish my meal were a lot better.

I went with my family this past Saturday and we were treated to slightly rude, slighty indifferent service as well as tasteless food that did not match the description on the menu.  For example, the stuffed mushrooms contained shrimp and that was not clearly indicated on the menu.  Many people have shrimp allergies, so that is just plan unsafe.  Another example: my sister ordered what was described on the menu as grilled chicken with peanuts and raisins.  The dish came out covered in cheese.  Um, I thought the point of a menu was to describe the food that you can expect to eat.  Not so at Mallorca.  Also, my dish was entirely flavorless, and overpriced to boot.  I would NOT at all recommend eating here.",

Unbelievably salty.  Main: Paella. I was excited for this. Unfortunately, it was so dry it was hard to eat without sipping water. Not alot of flavor. Seafood and chicken was so overcooked it was either gummy or rock solid. I would have sent it back, but it took 20 mins to get it the first time.  Service: completely hit or miss  Overall: I won't ever go back. Worst way to spend $100 in the city. Very disappointed.  UPDATE: After a fortuitous encounter with Micah Rosa, who manages Mallorca's online advertisement/identity, I was given a gift card for a revisit. I have given Mallorca one more star. I am grateful for the hospitality. I thought the service was great this time around. No flies in my drinks. No waiting for overcooked food. IN FACT, the fish I had was perfectly cooked, as was my wife's steak. This restaurant just isn't for me, however. The food just isn't on par with the price. Quantities are outrageous, so it is hard to go home hungry, but I get can full anywhere.",

    "text": "I love this place.  While fad restaurants come and go, Mallorca has been a staple of Pittsburgh Dining as long as I have been alive.  While their wine menu is perhaps a bit to heavily influenced by some of their more famous patrons, it is very good.  Only fools who like to drink grapes grown from vines grafted onto Missouri vines will need to first gripe about the lack of french wine on the list, but then you can educate them on the fact that there are no 'old growth' french vines due to a little thing called blackrot.  THE FOOD!!!!!!!!!  Here is where True Spanish cooking excels!  Expect to taste the flavor of the meat and vegetables; not a wealth of spices like a poorly trained Chef would.  I personally recommend the Mariscada Aijillo or any of the Mariscada really!  The Veal is also always a please, but I prefer my food to be crawling in the ocean a day or two before I eat it.  I have taken many people here and recommended it to many friends.  I have only heard one bad report from all of those individuals and the complainer happens to be someone who lives on Wendy's so I take her complaints with a grain of salt.    GREAT PLACE!  Thank you for squeezing me in with short notice this weekend!",

    "text": "My wife and I stopped for an early dinner after I picked her up for a continuing ed class.  I admit my attire was not shirt and tie but a clean t-shirt.  We were greeted my a man wearing a dirty over starched tux thing.  We chose to sit out back and the patio was deserted. There were many clean tables around but he sat us at a dirty table.  A bus boy came out and said let me change that table cloth.  Our waiter came out, very pleasant and nice personality.  I guess the guy in the tux thing was an owner or manager.  The waiter said we could still order lunch, we were just under the time limit.  What a nice guy.  I ordered the soup and champagne lobster tails and my wife ordered some beef and gravy.  The waiter asked us if we wanted two spoons for the soup, again what a guy.  The soup was very good, the lobster tail not much flavor.  The beef and gravy was good.  We split a desert of some type of kiwi cheese cake.  Very good.  My mother taught me how to bake so I feel qualified to say nice job.  The lunch was $90.00. If it wasn't for the rude greasy guy in the tux we may have given them another shot.  We gave the excellent waiter a well deserved tip.  But I found the place over rated and over priced.  A $90 lunch should have been to die for.  They can keep the dirty tux guy that sat us at a dirty table like our money was no good.  I have found it consistent that people who eat at over priced food rave about it.  I go for fresh food, well seasoned and taste.  The soup was good, the gravy good flavor and the desert was top notch.  But don't sit me at a dirty table because my t-shirt is plain and has a pocket on the front.  At least my clothes were clean.  Hats off to the staff, especially the waiter, he earned a nice tip.  I hope Mr. tux thing doesn't share in the tip.",

    "text": "Getting to the restaurant from any direction is a challenge on a weekend night, on which the South Side is a hub of frenzied activity, hordes of young people throughout the area and gridlock on the streets.  Mallorca does not have sufficient capacity in its parking lot, which is adjacent to the restaurant, for which there is a fee of $5 plus gratuity.  When one enters the restaurant on a weekend night, they must first navigate wall-to-wall people in the bar in order to approach the stand where the hostess and owner are stationed.    I have no complaint about waiting for a table.  As soon as all the members of our party arrived, our OpenTable reservation garnered us a table immediately.  The dining room is as loud, uncomfortable, and jammed with tables of diners as one can imagine.  The tables are placed so as to allow but a few inches between parties, not the way I wish to enjoy an expensive meal at an exclusive restaurant.  It is not possible to enjoy intimate conversation when one must lean over the table and speak loudly to address their guests.  The strong suit of the restaurant is the gracious service and warm welcome that is provided by every skilled staff member, including owner Antonio Pereira.  A team of young men provides service to the table.  Mr. Pereira came to the table to ensure our satisfaction, always a nice and appreciated touch.  Numerous specials are announced with flair, but without any indication of the prices, which are high. Our dinner check for four was $205.20.  My pork chops in garlic sauce entree contained a generous three chops taking up a large plate, but they were served with no topping or sauce, and were dry. My fellow diners seemed to enjoy their entrees: osso buco special, vegetarian paella, and veal in cream sauce.  The portions of most dishes are generous and many will take home part of their meals.  Rather than to allow the customer to choose what they would like, the restaurant makes it easy for itself by providing one type of salad and standard side dishes to all.  Included with dinners is a small salad on a tiny plate, topped with a delicious thousand island dressing.  Side dishes are plain, unseasoned, bland fresh vegetables: cauliflower, peas, a couple of carrot slices, and a couple of green beans, and a small plate of tasty, but not crisp homemade chips that had apparently been prepared long before being served.  With the exception of the delicious and appetizing creme brulee, which I ordered, the desserts do not lend themselves to being shared; they are small portions.  Mallorca, housed on the crazed South Side, and a significant distance from my home, is not going to be my choice for an expensive evening out in the future.",

    "text": "A dining experience at Mallorca is akin to the grand display of pageantry from the dining scene of Beauty and the Beast: things are lit on fire, waiters can ramble off twenty different specials off the top of their head, four or five different waiters and staff cater to you throughout your dining experience, and the evening is finished off with shots of Amarguinha.  There's no doubt about it, much of Mallorca's appeal stems from the incredible five-star service. My family and I had a rough time picking a special occasion restaurant and ended up here. With mixed reviews around the table, I would certainly recommend that people look past the few shoddy reviews and give it a shot for themselves. It's been around for about twenty years and is most certainly a Pittsburgh destination.  We started off with a pitcher of sangria (excellent) and an order of peppers stuffed with seafood and cheeses (also good). As for entrees, I ordered the paella and was rather disappointed. It came with chicken, scallops, shrimp, langostinos,  clams, sausage, and mussels. Touted as a house specialty, the whole dish was rather dry and I found that it was not as infused with the saffron flavor that I am used to from other places.   My mom ordered the soft shell crab special and here's where Mallorca picks up a few points. This dish is literally my mom's favorite food and she said these were the best she has ever had in her life. I'm used to the paltry, tiny crabs but this dish was served with three HUGE crabs cooked in a wine and butter sauce that was to die for. Although I'm not normally a big fan of soft shell crabs, these were absolutely phenomenal. My dad ordered the veal Marsala and it was decent. Every entree is served with platters of vegetables and saffron rice. Overall, the portion sizes are humongous.  For dessert, I ordered a piece of the almond cake and this was absolutely delicious. The cake was light and fluffy and the almond creme was to die for. To top off the meal, the servers bring out complimentary shots of Amarguinha (a Portuguese almond liqueur), which I thought was a delightful touch.   Overall, I will definitely be back to try more on this menu. I'll be staying away from the paella and veering more towards their seafood dishes, which I highly recommend to anyone considering an evening at Mallorca.",

    "text": "We've come here for years, brought friends and family. Normally I would have given it 4-5 stars, but not this past Wednesday. Chuck, David & I were seated in the bar area. In short order we were switched through waiters. No problem. The grilled banana peppers were great as usual. David & I ordered the lobster bisque. It had a thin tomato base with a faint lobster after-taste. Mine had a scant few flecks of lobster no larger than a pin head. David's didn't even have that. A True disappointment. All our veal entrees were very good. The chocoholics at the table tried to share a piece of chocolate cake, but it was too sweet to finish. Our exuberant and friendly waiter made a great fuss over his tables, saying he wanted them to come back. He made much of bringing the end-of-meal shots, and holding the door for the departing guests. When it was our turn, although we had caused him no problems, he brought us no shots, just the check. He left the room before we did. We had been told that he was a waiter-in-training. He told us he was getting extra help just because he was sick (as he picked up our extra bread in his hands-- no I don't think we'll take that bread home). So clearly, he doesn't care if we ever come back. This used to be one of my favorite places on Carson. Now, I'm not impressed.",

That being said, I still enjoyed my meal. I didn't pay for my meal though, but I think the prices are quite high. I might return for a special occasion but for me, there are other restaurants where I'd probably spend this money before returning here.",

    "text": "I've read many of the reviews. Any reviewer that said anything less than a fabulous dining experience is 100% erroneous. This restaurant is delightful. The service was excellent. Anyone who stated the staff was overly attentive- has obviously never been to a fine dining restaurant. The servers are all very knowledge, helpful, and friendly. The specials provided during last night's service were amazing. I wish I could have ordered them all. I was fortunate to arrive at 5pm and all the tables around me ordered about the same time so I could observe the entrees and hear the reviews.  The Kobe beef steak had to be well over 1lb. It looked amazing and the gentleman that eat it stated as much. His wife has the veal osso buco, although I was a bit dubious to order this here- she loved it. I never saw such large pieces of veal shanks. She loved it and said she would eat it over the next three days. The portions were huge.  My husband and I had the grilled calamari stuffed with prosciutto. It was amazing. Perfectly cooked, seasoned, and complemented the house bread well.   I ordered the Sangria. Typically, I prefer making my own as I enjoy a nice peach mint white Sangria. However, after reading the reviews on here I trusted my fellow positive food critics that enjoyed this place. I was not let down! It was not overly dry, as many others I have tried at other establishments in the past were. I even tend to enjoy most dry wines but for whatever reason never liked the red Sangria until I drank theirs. Hints of fruit were light and appropriate. Also, the liqueur blended in, likely Brandy, was not obtuse by any means.  Just subtle and lovely.   Then came the  house salad with a nice, spicy dressing. Something that reminds me of a French blend. Not my favorite, but the lovely mixture of greens, fresh herbs, and hearts of palm made me forget that I was n otin love with the dressing.  As i was craving fresh seafood, I splurged on the crab stuffed twin whole lobsters. Amazing. The lobster was cooked perfectly, the crab stuffing was lightly blended with cream and hints of cheese. The rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned-mixed with peas and carrots. Equally well, were the broccoli rabe and vegetable melody.  My husband ordered the grilled sea scallops in brandy. The scallops had a perfect sear to them, and the brandy sauce was not over powering. It was an excellent marriage. He loved this so much he has requested I make this sauce at home. I will try to do that this week =)  Compliments of the house, provided an almond after dinner liqueur-the name sadly has escaped me. Nevertheless, it was a perfect ending to a wonderful meal. I am not even a big fan of after dinner liqueurs, a bit too high in the calories. However, I don't care I will be ordering that again the next time we go!  As far as the prices, I think they are equivalent to any other fine dining establishment in the area. In fact, I think it is actually more than fair given the excellent service, free parking, and insane abundance of food. I will likely be dinning here at LEAST once a month.",

As there were quite a number of specials, it would be helpful to have them printed out. We were served small packets of butter with the bread which did not match what you are paying for a meal. The bread could be improved and they should standardize on olive oil. There were a number of flies around the table. The staff were carrying on conversations which took away from the ambiance and was distracting. We had the Portuguese sausage which was flavored well but was very dry. We were not provided with knives to cut the sausage so had to use our butter knives. The waiters were all very personable and knowledgeable.  We had the salmon and wild boar both which were delicious. The rice and vegetables were very good. The chips were so-so. These three are standard with every meal unless you request something different. We will give them another try as there are other menu items that got our attention, but it may not stay high on our list, especially at their price point, if the items above aren't corrected.",

I had the broiled seafood special for $29.95 but when I got the check it was $39.95. I didn't complain because I thought it was too cheap for lobster, giant shrimp and giant scallops, clams, mussels, rice and vegetabales plus a garden salad.  It was very good.  I also had the shrimp appetizer (5 giant cocktail shrimp).    Took a long time to get my main dish and the check/paying it.   Food has always been very good.  Free valet parking.",

It was quiet for a Tuesday night and a weird atmosphere but a nice cozy spot for date night. The service was excellent-from taking our order quickly to refilling our water and Sangria.  We went with a pitcher of their famous Sangria. It was plenty for 2 people-not too sweet and they only have the option of red.  The entrees come with a salad which was a pleasant surprise.  The salad had cucumbers, lettuce and tomato with a French type dressing that was very tasty.  For my entree I went with the petite filet with a white pepper sauce that I asked for on the side. Glad I did as it was too sweet for me for a steak sauce.  The filet was cooked just right. It came with an abundance of sides including rice, cooked veggies and Spanish potatoes which were just homemade chips.   My date got the paella which had rice, baby lobster tail and mussels-it was a huge portion. We somehow managed to save room for dessert and shared a piece of dark chocolate cake-the icing was good but the cake was pretty dry.  The prices are a bit high but you do get a lot of food.",

Our water glasses were never empty, our table cleaned of dishes and silverware between each course. Our party enjoyed steak (large and tender), lobster (plenty of meat), stuffed lobster tails (unbelievable) and the best dish, blackened swordfish.

I started with a Gazpacho that was not very good. It lacked the texture and the taste, so I was anticipating a poor meal. Luckily, I had also ordered an octopus appetizer. The octopus was extremely tender, cooked to perfection. Unfortunately the potatoes that went with it were undercooked. That was kind of sad. It is so hard to cook octopus well that it is unfortunate to have the potatoes miss the bar. By the way, the portion of octopus was huge. I then had an excellent entree of Monkfish, very fresh and well cooked. I thought all the side dishes (chips, vegetables, and rice were unnecessary and did not add anything to the meal, honestly). I finished with the catalan-style Creme Brulee.  The wine list is pretty good and I was able to find some excellent spanish wines, although they are a bit overpriced. I went for a Priorat (Camins by Alvaro Palacio).  The service was pretty good, and they even offered free ham and cheese and liquor. That is very \"typical spanish\" so it gave it a nice touch.  I felt it was overall a very good experience although maybe a bit pricey. If I had known portions were so huge, and there were so many side dishes I might have skipped some of the appetizers though.",

We love the atmosphere, it's busy but not loud where you can't hear the person in front or beside you. We've never had a bad experience here.",

The place is pretty dressy and would recommend that you look nice. It gets very crowded and you NEED reservations to get seated.   Go here for Spanish/Portuguese food and you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "OK, I want you to know that this review is for my only experience there, which was a \"business dinner\" in the back room several months ago. I imagine that individual diners may have a different experience, but alas, this was mine. I do enjoy Spanish food (a lot...) and plan to return to try them out again in the near future.  We had a smattering of pre-ordered tapas to start - these ranged from stuffed peppers and calamari (really tasty), to the traditional \"tortilla\" egg and onion dish. I must say that these were delicious and well prepared - these dishes definitely whet my appetite for things to come...  For my main dish, I figured that a paella would be a \"signature dish\" for a Spanish restaurant, and decided to indulge. Unfortunately, I was VERY disappointed in this dish overall, as it was mostly a gargantuan pile of yellow rice with small amounts of chicken, fish, and seafood. I've had paellas many, many times, and have come to expect a certain level of excellence with this dish, although it is very challenging to prepare. Perhaps it was the large number of diners we had with our group, but this dish was hastily thrown together, and basically tasted as if it had come directly from a Vigo box.  The atmosphere is nice - we sat in their banquet room, and it was an attractive, comfortable place to conduct our meeting and eat. Service was EXCELLENT - the wait staff kept all the drinks topped off, and were extremely attentive. I especially liked the sangria, it was delicious, and plentiful!  So, while I've given it a paltry two stars for this single experience, I believe that mitigating factors could be in play here, and will give them a second chance sometime soon. We plan to focus mainly on a tapas style dinner, rather than having the entrees - the enormous portions of all the entrees I saw really was a bit of a turn-off... The excellent, friendly service, I suspect, is more representative of what they are trying to accomplish here.",

The food came out very quickly and was as good as ever!  The service is always great and fast as well.  I was sad to see more tables weren't filled up!  The only thing I was bummed about was, the minute we brought out a meal deal coupon, the great service stopped.  We never got the shot EVERYONE (other than those underage) gets after their meals, we didn't get drink refills (we would have drank another glass of sangria!), etc.  But, otherwise, it was scrumptious as always and the service was great till the coupon showed up :)",

One gentleman insisted on rolling his r's in an exaggerated way (\"look how very Spanish I am!\"), as my friends and I fought to keep straight faces. Halfway through the evening, he forgot to keep up the pretense and used normal r's. Another gentleman seemed scattered; he asked the same questions (\"Did you like the sangria? Do you want red wine or white?\") multiple times. * Tables: We were in one of the three \"rooms\" that the restaurant has. The tables were placed so close together that we watched servers bump into each other. And yet, the front of the house was totally empty--no one at the bar or at the tables.  One bottle of wine, three entrees and one soup cost us $145 before tip. We left $30 (20%) and headed out. We will not be back.",

Was disappointment that they had a special menu that was off limits to the living social coupon.  It was not mentioned on the living social coupon however that you had to stick to their main menu. I might mention that the food on the anniversary menu was not that cheap (19.00 a dinner). Would likely not be back but alas,have another coupon to use in the future. Well, maybe for the courtyard ambiance in the summer. Might be your thing though, if you don't mind the expense and you like spicy food and under cooked vegetables.  ++ positive remark for convenient parking, which is a real find in  south side.",

    "text": "High Priced with Poor Quality Food and Service  We had a dinner reservation yesterday at Mallorca and were thoroughly disappointed and outdone by the poor service and the quality of the food, which was nearly inedible.   Although we were seated promptly, the two waters that we received were not drinkable. Unbelievably, one had a mouth print on the glass (which suggests it wasn't washed properly) and the other had a gnat on the outside of the glass. When we pointed this out to the server, he hesitated to bring fresh water in clean glasses. He took the glass of water, but was not even competent enough to wipe off the gnat completely, he simply brought the water back as if the smashed gnat on the glass would be invisible.  We finally requested that the two dirty glasses be left on the table and that two additional glasses be brought to make sure that the request was actually honored.   We requested straws that weren't even properly packaged. They were not enclosed in plastic or paper. Needless to say, we decided against drinking ANY of the water because we were concerned that it was contaminated.   The food (Salmon and Vegetarian Paella) was unseasoned and not very appetizing in presentation.  We were served salad that did not appear to be fresh, and the dressing was already on it. We had to request salad without the dressing but with oil and vinegar, which is what we prefer and what we would've expressed had we simply been asked. The glass containers that the oil and vinegar were in were greasy and appeared unclean.   We did not enjoy the meal or the overall experience. We felt sorely disappointed by the service and would never consider patronizing this establishment again. Dining at Mallorca was a waste of money, and had we not been in a celebratory mood from the outset, we would not have been able to endure the poor service and the poorly prepared food.",

    "text": "Went for dinner for Valentine's Day, I have never been there but my wife has. At first I wasn't impressed with the seating, table and atmosphere in general. The table was VERY small and we sat so close to the next table that you felt like you were having dinner with friends.   I warmed up to the restaurant after a while as I started to appreciate the ambiance. Our waiter was great, he was very cordial and attentive to the customers.   We started with our standard glass of wine, sorry I like my Cabs! We started with the stuffed calamari appetizer. It was enough to share which I'm glad we did. The calamari was stuffed with prosciutto and covered in a red garlic sauce that was scrumptious! Our salads were delivered pre-made with a house dressing which was reminiscent of thousand island. My wife had chicken in a white wine garlic sauce that was so light but full of flavor. The breasts were very tender and cut thinner than you expect. They brought vegetables, rice and their signature homemade potato chips. I know most people wouldn't like fried sliced potatoes with such a great meal but they're my favorite. I had the Monk Fish Diablo style which was spicy but nothing too much as my wife even liked it and spicy is not her favorite. I must say the monk fish was fabulous, the fish was cooked to perfection and adding the rice on the side mixed with the diablo sauce was to die for!  For dessert we shared a piece of tiramisu which was delightful, probably one of the best I have had.  I can't say enough about the service, our waiter was fabulous,  as I mentioned earlier,  very attentive to us and very personable,  he made the experience that much more enjoyable.  The entire staff was great, they kept things flowing and didn't leave dirty dishes sitting on the table.  I would recommend this place as the food and service was great. I think the ambiance is old world and you'll warm up to it if you allow yourself. I'll be going back again soon!",

Spanish rice and thick potato chips accompanied everything (except the paella of course). The shrimp were cooked perfectly. The enchilado sauce was wonderful - a rich tomato base with nice spice.  The head waiter had a great poker face but was a lot of fun. Somehow he managed to get through the lengthy list of specials from memory. He was very knowledgeable about all the dishes and was happy to answer all our questions. There was so much on the menu we didn't get a chance to try - we're definitely going back for more!",

The waiters were super friendly and attentive and even allowed me to brush up some of my Spanish. It wasn't the quickest time waiting for our food, but that's to be expected of a traditional Spanish restaurant. They were also busy Saturday night as well.   We started off with the daily special appetizer of grilled octopus. This was so good, very tender, and it reminded me of Spain/Portugal. For entrees, we shared twin lobster tails stuffed with crab meat. The crab meat in it was very good, but I think the lobster may have been a little overcooked because it was dry and slightly tough. The seafood paella we got was a bit too salty for me. I actually liked the side of Spanish rice better than the rice in the paella because of the saltiness. The seafood in there was ok, but I couldn't finish even one piece of chicken because it was overcooked. The seafood in it was alright. I'm pretty picky with food even though I'll try pretty much anything.  At the end, they gave us two shots of complimentary almond liquor which was a nice gesture. I'd probably go back if I wanted to get a nice dinner while visiting Pitt again to get the grilled octopus and try other seafood again, maybe the daily specials are where it's at. The lobster tails and paella didn't quite do it for me. The ambience was really lovely though, but I wish the food was kicked up a notch.  PS They have complimentary valet parking to the left of the restaurant which is good because that area looked crazy when I was trying to get off the bridge",
