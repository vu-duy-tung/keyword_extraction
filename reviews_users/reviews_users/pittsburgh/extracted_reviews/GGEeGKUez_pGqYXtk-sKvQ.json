It's popular so there are times where you might have to wait but as with all things in life you can choose to wait or just go somewhere else that isn't as busy. Outrageous breakfast sandwich is always the bomb. My daughter got the chicken fried steak and eggs with gravy on the side. She said it was solid choice. Great food ,good service.",

I had Raisin French Toast, something I've never had from Kelly O's before, so I can't compare it to the cooking at the original location, but it was the same generous portion I've come to expect from Kelly O's.  I loved the coffee, too; generous refills are always noted!  The rest of the table enjoyed their meals - clean plates all around.",

This is definitely a place where you indulge yourself with comfort breakfast foods: eggs, bacon, toast, coffee, etc. As long as you don't expect something fancy, this is a good place for you. I always get the World Famous Breakfast and a side of the grilled cinnamon roll to go. The first time I came here, the bacon was too greasy but a quick dab with my napkin cleared up the problem. The following visits were so much better. The food was consistently delicious, and I find myself wanting to come here just for the cinnamon roll. It's definitely not a place I would go to every morning but is a diner that picks up my spirits when I come here. An added bonus is the quick service. There was never a time when I was waiting too long for a check or to give my order. If you want some comfort food for breakfast, definitely check Kelly O's out!",

    "text": "Kelly O's is one of those cute-looking diners that I probably wouldn't try unless I was socializing with someone outside of my usual circle. I've found that unfortunately most old-school Pittsburgh diners don't cater to people with food allergies very well, so I just end up feeling horrible afterwards. My mother wanted to come here after I finished running in the half marathon however, and since she'd offered to treat both my boyfriend and myself to breakfast I agreed. We arrived and were given a table immediately, since the strip had just begun to reopen and the place wasn't yet packed. Had we been twenty minutes later I think we would have waited an hour.  We were given waters and menus within five minutes by our brusque but efficient waitress and immediately began looking at the options. I settled on hash browns and bacon, since those usually don't come into contact with milk or vast amounts of butter. Our waitress soon came back bringing the coffee we'd ordered initially and took our food orders. This was where we ran into problems. I can understand that many native Pittsburghers have a more simple attitude towards food (getting my mom's boyfriend from Brentwood to grasp the severity of her symptoms after eating wheat was like pulling teeth!) however I didn't really like how my mother was treated like a nuisance for not wanting toast included with her meal due to her celiac disease. My mom is one of the sweetest, most courteous people I know and she didn't even ask for a substitute, she simply didn't want the bread touching her food. Finally the waitress huffed and puffed and agreed to give it to my boyfriend who was sitting across the table instead. Crisis averted! After that I didn't dare ask that my food be made dairy-free and just sat there hoping for the best.   Our meals came quickly and were hot when they arrived. Everything was good for standard diner fare, and the bacon was above average in my opinion. It was done but still chewy, which is a hard balance to strike. The people at Kelly O's definitely know how to prepare what they're serving properly. I did have a stomach ache later, however I shouldn't have been so reluctant to trouble our waitress. In light of the old-style (read treating the customer like they're bothersome) Pittsburgh service here I don't think I'll be back myself, however I'd gladly recommend Kelly O's Diner to anyone without food allergies.",

    "text": "In recent months, I wrote about a comparison between The Dor-Stop and Pamela's, two popular breakfast diners here in the Pittsburgh region.  I have been hearing good things about Kelly O's in Pittsburgh's Strip District and invited my aunt for a Sunday gab session.    We were off to a good start at 9:30 and had a seat as soon as we arrived.  Promptly, a coffee was served and within 5 minutes our order was placed.  Then... it got super busy and people were seated all around us.  That is good, right?  Well, they also received their food before us even when our order was BEFORE theirs.  This went on for 25 minutes.  My aunt and I had a lot of catching up to do, so we were enjoying the outing.  However, we were getting hungry and this needed to be addressed.  The server immediately checked and mentioned that our order was submitted but somehow half of it disappeared off the handwritten slip.  The waitress was nice, but the excuse did not seem to make sense.  Regardless, our orders were placed again \"on the fly\" and we received them within 5 minutes of the complaint.    Now, the actual food.  I had a steak and cheese omelette which was good, served with potatoes (onions and peppers added for an extra cost).  It was extremely good and not overly greasy like some diner food can be at times.    In closing, it was a shame that the order fell through the cracks because the saving moment was that the quality of the food spoke for itself.  As we departed the extremely cute stand-alone building, there was a line out the door.  In my mind I thought, these folks will get a quality breakfast and everyone makes a few mistakes.  I will give this place a chance again, especially since they have a lunch menu that looked delicious.",

The diner is always crazy busy and crowded which is to be expected when trying to grab breakfast in the strip.   We walked right in and got two seats at the bar. My husband was happy to see that the orange juice was fresh squeezed. I wasn't so happy about the price ($4 wow. I could buy a whole jug at the store!).   We both ordered eggs Benedict; mine was traditional and my husband had veggie. They were both delicious and very filling (I always feel like I get too much food for breakfast). I ordered the home fries and my husband had the shredded potatoes. You can get them with or without peppers and onions. I preferred the home fries because they had a better flavor.   I was surprised by the price of the meal. $30 for two breakfasts with the bulk of the cost in beverages.  Overall, we did enjoy our experience.",

I couldn't decide between the biscuits and gravy and the grilled cinnamon roll, so I got both. I'm so glad I did because both were completely amazing. My sister ordered the chicken, feta and spinach omelette and it was insanely good as well. The coffee was eh, but that's not unusual for a diner, and nothing some extra sugar and cream can't fix. The incredible food by far makes up for the unimpressive coffee. I will absolutely be coming back here next time I am in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "I went to the Kelly O's in the North Hills years ago and was so NOT impressed.  I tried Pamela's a month or two ago, and I was again so NOT impressed.  I gave up all hope on finding diner breakfast in Pittsburgh.  However, one morning I was meeting friends for breakfast, and we were looking for somewhere near work.  I figured why not give the original Kelly O's a chance?  I played it safe and ordered the Don's Free Ride Omelette ($6.99) with Ham, Cheese, Tomato, and green peppers.  It also came with toast so I ordered rye.  I am not a potato eater and this was one of the only options without potatoes.  The omelette was packed full, and the price was super fair.  Our food came out quickly and service was fast but on the go friendly.  This is as close as you seem to get to diner style in Pittsburgh.  Credit card minimum of $10 and there is a small parking lot where you can park for free!",

My friend Brandi and i stopped in on saturday. we were on the hunt for st patricks day shirts in the strip and she let me decide on where to have brunch since im a yelper n'at. I had a few places in mind, but I remember walking by Kelly O's during the burgh bash and ive wanted to try it since then.  We arrived around 130 but still decided on breakfast. We informed our server it was our first time here, and she gave great suggestions. They have specials daily. A few from Saturday were: pierogi and cheese omelet, philly steak omelet, oreo pancakes.. I decided on the breakfast burrito. It's huge and inside you'll find eggs, home fries, onions, peppers and cheese. You can add a side of sour cream for 50 cents or meat for $1.50-$2. i went with sweet sausage. I also ordered a side of shredded potatoes with green peppers and onions because i love eating them as a side :) My friend Brandi ordered the french toast which is topped with cinnamon sugar. She ordered the home fries and said that they were very well seasoned.    We sat near where the cooks let out the food. everything looked great! Waffles, huge salads, omelets. We are super excited to head back!",

Having said that, Kelly O has a parking lot.  So definitely stop-by and eat before seeing Strip District.   Kelly O is newer (OMG it's 5 years already, I remember seeing its renovation) and clean.  I also like that fact that it has items of small portion. My mum doesn't eat much, and she had either a \"two eggs and toast\" ($4), or \"Breakfast sandwich\" ($4).  Freshly squeezed orange juice is a plus.   100% will be back.  I want to try their Crab Egg Benedict.  No menu on yelp here. just check out their website.",

So as we were enjoying this amazing food and incredible coffee we were graced with the presence of Kelly O. She came over to see our bubba (see photo). She spent some time with us telling us her story and enjoying our little guy. As I was raving about the coffee she explained it's for sale up front which made my day. Then to our surprise she had a bag delivered to our table. Such a sweet, caring, giving heart which I imagine explains the success of Kelly Os. Will be back and will tell everyone about this place.",

    "text": "My co-worker and I were super excited to try Kelly O's after hearing some super awesome things. Unfortunately, our experience was not so super. The server that took our drink order was super nice and very fast. After we received our drinks, we ended up sitting there for 10 minutes before a different server came by to take our food order.  Our chili and soup came out pretty quick. The chili was lukewarm and super bland. 35 minutes went by and we still had not gotten our entrees. It also was not busy at all inside. Not even have to the tables/booths were being occupied. We asked our server to check on our food and she said that they were waiting on our fries. Clearly we were either forgotten about or they were short staffed. We had to have our server box up our food before it even arrived to us as we had spent almost an hour inside and had to get back to work.  My co-worker was comped for her entree but I was not. We didn't realize this until we were on our way back to the office. When I called to see why she was comped and I was not, the floor manager told me that it was their mistake and that my co-worker should not have been comped. She said that she conferred with our server and that they didn't see any need to issue any sort of refund. I ended up paying over $14.00 for a tiny cup of bland chili, cold fries, and a tuna melt that was not \"melted\" at all.  The manager I spoke with was quite nice, but not willing to budge. She said if she would have known that our food was taking long then she would have rectified the situation while we were there. I explained that she would have known if she had done a table touch, or even walked over to the general area where we were sitting. We never met the manager.The server knew we were dissatisfied. That should have been enough to earn a visit from the manager. Kelly O's penny pinching, money hungry attitude and lack of ANY customer service was enough to make me spend time to write this review. I would definitely think twice about spending your well earned money here.",

I was sold when I read it was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and it was recommended on Spoon University. I ordered the OMG Breakfast and my dad ordered the Red, White, and Blue Waffle so we could split (savory and sweet). They forgot the blackberries that were listed as coming with the waffle, but it was yummy nonetheless with strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and whipped cream. You don't even need syrup for it to taste good; it was dense and fluffy! The eggs were a little bland, and the hash browns were a little buttery and not crispy enough. I liked the Italian bread, though! Our waitress was friendly and the service was quick. You get PLENTY of food for the price-the portions are super generous!",

Ordered breakfast food and it was amazing. I ordered a basic waffle with eggs & bacon and my bf ordered the steak with potatoes. We were both extremely happy with the food and with our waitress.  We then realized that this spot was featured on Triple D which was awesome. In hindsight we would have ordered what they were famous for lol.  My only issue was when I walked in there was this long line of people waiting. We asked the group in front how long they've been waiting and we were told 30 mins and no one acknowledged them yet.   Anyway highly recommend this spot but be warned it gets packed due to its size. We sat at the bar so took us like 5 mins to be seated.",

I had the stuffed banana pepper omelette which was like... a sausage stuffed banana pepper wrapped in fluffy eggs and smothered in hot italian sauce with cheese. DELICIOUS. Their magical orange juice machine is fun to watch too. They load oranges in top, it whirls around, crushes a few, and out pours your juice. The orange juice is really the star of the show here in the morning. Our server seemed a little overwhelmed. She forgot one orange juice, topped off coffee one time, and it was obvious she was hoping we would leave so she could turn the table over for the next group. Last but most important, if you go here on a Saturday, you better be here by 8 am or there will be a line out the door. The people in line were all staring wistfully at my orange juice. Now I know how a cute puppy must feel in a pet store.",

Decor is what you would imagine a diner to look like-not fancy, loaded with Steelers momentos. They have a large variety of breakfast menu options (also serve lunch & dinners) and also specials, many which relate to Pittsburgh using kielbasa, pierogies or haluski as a main ingredient. Service was quick, friendly & efficient on a freezing New Year's Day at 10am. The coffee was hot & tasty and refills were quick. I had the Pittsburgh Benedict which came with pierogies & kielbasa and 2 eggs on thick sliced Italian bread with Hollandaise sauce and home fries. Add onions & peppers to your home fries or hash browns for 75 cents & they taste so much better. They make fresh squeezed orange juice. My husband had 2 eggs, turkey sausage & home fries all tasty as well and added a pancake as a side which was a 1/2\" thick and as big as a plate. We enjoyed everything & would definitely recommend Kelly O's for breakfast!",

Today we decided to try something new and hit up Kelly O's! I am sooo glad we did.  First off, there were 4 parties and 14 people in front of us when we arrived. Used to the 45+ minute waits at Pamelas and Delucas, we were unsure whether or not we should stay, but we got through so fast. It wasn't more than 15 minutes before we were seated. We came at 9:15 am on a Saturday so I feel like it was probably a pretty busy time.  Once we got seated, our hostess quickly got our drinks. (Coffee is good, and definitely try their house-made OJ!!) Our waitress was nice and got everything correct. Drinks were refilled quickly without us having to ask, and everyone was so nice.   I had the strawberry and cream french toast (yummy!) and the home fries (delicious, crispy on the outside, flavored well). My hubby had a build your own omelette (he says it was great, and it was huge!). The food was good and affordable. Bigger portions than the other diners in the Strip.  If you're in the Strip, go to Kelly O's. The service, food, and wait times are all better than other hot spots in the Strip like Pamelas and Delucas.",

I've never been in a customer service place where I or others were treated so poorly.

Despite being very busy during the typical brunch rush (as all diners are), they do a really great job of moving things quickly--from seating to ordering to serving your order. There is a counter where you can always grab a spot if there is an opening. I've been here with groups of up to 6 people. We had to wait a little longer than if it were only 2-4 people, but they were still able to accommodate. Service has always been great too!  I always have to order a glass of the fresh squeezed orange juice. They have a machine behind the counter that makes/dispenses the juice. As far as food, they have a wide variety of breakfast and lunch foods, although I always go for the breakfast. They have some of my favorite breakfast dishes, including Country Fried Steak and a variety of Eggs Benedict.  You will never leave hungry because the portions are huge! I usually have enough potatoes to take home and use for my breakfast the following morning.   If you typically default to DeLuca's or Pamela's, I would definitely suggest giving Kelly O's a try!",

The owner makes these recipes like you're mum makes at home, which makes this place feel even more comfortable.  We frequent this place often (at least twice a month).  We've tried almost everything on the menu and nothing has disappointed. I'm a personal fan of their chicken salad sandwich.  It's large pieces of chicken with just the right amount of mayo and celery, served on two slices of Mancini's bread.  Absolutely delicious.  And their onion rings are huge and crispy.  The breakfast options are vast and they always have interesting specials on the large board in the back of the restaurant.   I can't say enough good things about the servers. They all work extremely hard and do a fantastic job of keeping your cup full and your food coming.  If you are there more than 2 or 3 times, they are probably going to remember you.  It's a small joint, but the kitchen staff gets the food out quickly and it's always tasty.  If you're in the Strip, Kelly O's is a fantastic option for breakfast or lunch.  I just wish they'd open up in the evenings.  For Strip residents, like us, we would love a quick, neighborhood diner to pop into on the weeknights.",

The place was packed but luckily the only large table became available after waiting for about 10 min. or so.  Despite the place being packed and busy - we were promptly served with coffee and our orders placed within few minutes. We all had something different from the Veggie Burrito, World Famous Breakfast, Steak and Eggs with biscuits/gravy. Pretty much all the breakfast had an option for either the potato fries or the shredded potatoes. The potatoes were good but I like the Pamela's more. Overall, the service was good - food was good and the service was much better than expected.  Overall, a good alternate to Pamela's if you're in the strip.",

Excellent service, plenty to choose from on menu, prices reasonable. Breakfast was very good - eggs, sausage, bacon n pancakes - all cooked perfect and tasty. Wife enjoyed the chicken salad. Can't ask for a better experience.",

    "text": "My husband and I came here Sunday morning for a late breakfast around 11:45 AM. Amazingly, the wait was only about 15 minutes. (FYI they will not see you until your entire party is present in the building, which is a good policy because it prevents people from holding a table while others are waiting in line.) The menu is large, the servers friendly. We placed our order quickly because we had already \"studied\" the menu online. That's when the problem began. We waited 42 minutes for our breakfast to come out. After about 30 minutes I need to just stand up and move around because I was sore from sitting, and I noticed no one around us had any food either. That seemed very odd for a breakfast diner. I had tried to get the waitress's attention because I thought perhaps there was a problem in the kitchen that we needed to know about so we could leave. Everyone kept smiling and was pretty evasive and finally at 40 minutes I said something. I was told that all the tables had been seated at the same time so the kitchen was backed up. That would've made sense except it's breakfast and nobody's food had come out in sometime. ( even if there was a big rush on the kitchen they should be able to send out some breakfast dishes).  She said ours would soon be up though so we waited. Then a lot of people's food started coming out. I got my Yinzers sandwich, which was fine other than the bagel was not toasted or grilled or anything, just a plain ol' egg bagel cut in half, although it was fresh. The home fries were actually undercooked and I couldn't eat some of them because of that raw potato texture and taste. That was ironic given how long I waited for breakfast. I don't know if our experience was unusual or not. No other yelpers seem to mention the length of time they waited. I for one expected a quick diner breakfast and on with our day. My husband said it was the best sausage gravy he's ever had, and the biscuit was also good. We were both just frustrated over the wait and we're having a hard time enjoying the meal.",

My family was decked out in Chicago apparel when we came and the waitress (who grew up there) and my mom bonded right away.  Their menu is super extensive, with many breakfast and lunch options so I was overwhelmed. I ended up getting Seana's breakfast with bacon, eggs over easy, and french toast. The portion was huge and the french toast was the highlight of the meal because it was made on the famous Mancini bread...probably some of the best bread I've ever had. Next time I come I will probably just get french toast because the bread is THAT good. Everyone loved their meal and most entrees are huge and well priced (under 10$- such a steal because I am used to manhattan prices!) This place was featured on the food network too, for good reason.",

We where seated right away, which I didn't except because of the time of day. I ordered a steak & eggs (my usual). It was very good, I still prefer Bob's Diner's steak and eggs over all others though.  My daughter had a protein disk and was not impressed. My wife order a stand breakfast and like it a lot, she really like the toast which was fresh bread.  I will stop again if I am in the strip, but I wouldn't travel to the strip just for Kelly's. I still have to look up the episode of Diners, Drivein's and Dives that Kelly O's was on. I usually watch the show all the time.",

    "text": "It was a rare occasion that I was awake and out early on a Saturday morning.  I made the trek from Brighton Heights to Trader Joe's in the East End to do some grocery shopping before the crowds hit and on my way home I toyed with stopping by Coca Cafe but as I drove by around 9 AM it already looked like it was getting busy and being by myself I thought that I'd just go straight home instead.  I cut through the Strip District and as I arrived at the stop sign near Kelly O's I spotted a parking spot in the lot and the fond memories that I had from when the spot was once JoJo's drew me to stop in and give Kelly O's a second try as I had only been there one other time before and that visit had made me miss JoJo's even more...so, I really hoped that this visit would be a fresh start, but sadly, I should have just kept driving home.  I must say that I have really high standards when it comes to breakfast - even though the JoJo's omelet was enough for 3 meals and was possibly a heart attack waiting to happen it was delicious enough to be worth the risk.  I've also had very delicious but healthy breakfasts that I love just as much.  So, let's get to Kelly O's.  The place was busy but had a few empty booths/tables and seemed well-staffed so I was hopeful.    Despite there being an ample amount of staff behind the counter there really wasn't anyone playing hostess.  There was someone waiting in the front entry way and I stood near him waiting to be seated - I stood there for about 2 minutes before I was acknowledged, and that only happened after a larger group of people walked in behind me.  I was seated at a small table that was in a awkward location with a booth directly behind me with a direct line of site behind the counter, though a single diner arrived after me and was seated alone in a large booth along the windows, which had also been available upon my arrival.  My server came over without a menu and asked me if I knew what I wanted or did I need a menu?!?  I told him that, yes I needed a menu because it was only my second time there, and he told me that he was new and that he didn't know who the regulars were yet, and that most of them already knew what they wanted, so off he went to get me a menu.  I ordered a coffee, which took a couple of minutes to arrive, but then I had to ask for not only cream and sugar, but also then had to ask for silverware and a napkin once I realized that was also not already on the table - so already 10 minutes into my visit I had to 1) ask for a menu, 2) ask for cream and sugar after my coffee arrived, and 3) ask for silverware and a napkin - it wasn't looking too promising.  There wasn't anything on the menu that was jumping out at me and I don't eat pork, so I decided to get the country fried steak because in the description it read that it was \"covered in country gravy\" which I assumed was different than the \"homemade sausage gravy\" in the description for the biscuits and gravy, yet, when my breakfast arrived, it arrived with sausage gravy (I should have known better than to make assumptions so this was a good reminder to always ALWAYS ask) so I scraped the gravy off after posting my photo of course.  The country fried steak itself was decent though I haven't eaten country fried steak probably since grade school when it was routinely on the cafeteria menu so I really can't say that I have much to compare it to.  The shredded potatoes were devoid of any seasoning so I asked for ketchup and added salt and pepper (which I rarely do when eating out) and the over hard eggs were also just bland and in need of salt and pepper.  Overall, the whole meal was completely underwhelming.  During my meal, I also had to 1) ask for a coffee refill even though my server had passed by my table at least 3 times and then it took at least 5 minutes before I got a refill and 2) when I was done with my meal, I sat there for another 10 minutes after my plate was cleared waiting for my server who was somehow now stationed at the opposite end of the restaurant to bring my check, which inevitably, I had to ask a different server if she could check me out.  The only other time that I ate here a couple of years ago, it was also an unremarkable experience but I wanted to give them another chance.  It's unlikely that I will return as there are far better breakfast places in Pittsburgh.",

Also, get a few glasses of the freshly squeezed orange - they make it right in front of you.  For me the best part is the dining experience. I love to sit at the counter and interact with the wonderful waitstaff. There are always jokes being cracked and it can really lift your spirit.  One more thing I want to mention is that I love the fact that this place does not have any of the pretentious hipster BS that is creeping into almost every restaurant in the city. You know what I am saying - restaurants putting on a pretentious front and serving mediocre fare, while charging very handsomely.  Awesome place, I really love it!",

Be prepared to wait if your entire party doesn't arrive together. During the week, the rules are put aside and you can sit and wait for others to come in.  The service is pretty friendly and food to table time is pretty average.  I haven't had their orange juice, but they squeeze it on site. It looks really yummy.  Most recently, I ordered a side of their mush (polenta) and a breakfast sandwich with pepper jack cheese and two slices of bacon on top. I ordered the egg fried. I should have been specific, but I expected the egg to be at least a little runny. Instead, it was pretty dry. The cheese wasn't melted. In fact, it was still cold.  The mush was fried (3 rectangular pieces), served with a side of maple syrup. Polenta is pretty boring on its own, so I was hoping the syrup would liven it up. It did not.   My boyfriend ordered one of the omelette specials: pulled pork/beef with bbq sauce. We both ordered this the previous time we were at Kelly O's and enjoyed it. He noted that it was just as good as the first time. It was served with a few slices of white bread and their home fries.",

She waited on me during an ungodly early pre-work breakfast (6AM! I'm insane!) recently, and I couldn't have been more pleased by her work ethic and personality.   Hey, fearing for my safety, she even talked me out of getting both the Breakfast Burrito AND a Belgian waffle. Fawna had my back.   \"Lissen baby, you got nothin' to prove ah-ight,\" the tough-looking chick softly cooed into my ear.   Having typed that out, I have very little to complain about regarding my initial experience with the nationally-famed Kelly O's, this secondary location still being fairly new.   The Mixed Grill I ordered up came with a tender and tempting sweet sausage as per my specifications and were centered around weightless, nigh-cherubic scrambled eggs along with such potent vegetables peppers and onions. Only some more seasoning was required to elevate this to legend.  Arriving at Olympus' gates was the Strawberry Banana Waffle. Its base a golden maze of a crisp-fluffy waffle, topping it was fresh banana, a superbly saccharine strawberry marmalade sort of thing that would make for fine pie filling, and whipped cream.   \"Whew! I wasn't sure you were gonna finish that,\" she told me, sounding as relieved as a prizefighter's girlfriend after an easy knockout.  \"Eh, I beaten bigger,\" I replied, looking at my reflection in the gleaming steel plates that embellish the diner's alabaster walls as I hopped off of my counter stool and into the promising sunrise, hard luck hero that I try to be.   Methinks some of Kelly O's haters are a tad sheltered and privileged.   Don't be skeered o' Kelly. Ok? Come down and eat.   P.S. I didn't see Kelly herself working while I was there, but I can testify that the service was chipper and cordial. Of course, the roughneck gals have always taken a glint to me for reasons I'm unsure of. Winkin' back at ya, love.",

It isn't the healthiest food in the world, but I guess that's ok every once in a while. The portions are usually pretty big too and the prices are fair.",

Atmosphere: this might be the best part about the restaurant. It is in a little old time diner. All with the cool retro inside and silver walls. The outside is painted with a mural (great picture opportunity)  Food: the sausage gravy was really good as well as the outrageous sandwich with sausage and bacon. Both the sausage and bacon were great! Definitely get the home style potatoes instead of the shredded because the shredded isn't seasoned at all. We also got the corned beef and that was good as well.  This restaurant is also featured on DDD!!",

First thing that impressed me was their orange juice-fresh squeezed. But very expensive, $3.98 for a very small cup. Second, everything we ordered tasted very good, I have nothing to complain about the taste. We got pancake, cornbeef, country fried steak.   HOWEVER, the reason I am giving this place a 3 star and probably will not go back is because I found a hair in my gravy. That is a big turn off for me!!!!! And it clearly wasn't mine since I have dark long hair and it was short blond hair. So I stopped eating right way and took me a while to get that out off my head.",

    "text": "3.5 stars.  Definitely above average with a really great group of waitresses who are definitely are 4+ star team especially at 6 am.  Kelly O's is my first experience with any restaurant shown in the Drive In, Diners, and Dives.  I've always heard about the show but never had the urges to experience them myself.  I found myself needing to wake up waaaay too early and not much is open at 6 am.  Turns out Kelly O's Diner is open at 5 am and so I experienced my first True American diner.   There's a lot of great things going here.   At 6 am, maybe a quarter of the place was filled and the two ladies serving were just having a pleasant conversation.  I loved the fact they have their own parking here.  That is a huge bonus for the area and I didnt have to bother with street parking.  The restaurant is nice & clean, service here is pleasant, it might be a touch slow on getting your bill but the coffee refills are offered and a smile is always there.   The reason why I gave a lower rating is cause of the actual food... I think perhaps I ordered wrong.  I got a mixed grill from the Breakfast Favourites section and maybe I should have gotten a simpler omelette instead.    Mixed Grill - It's described as eggs, home fries, onions, green peppers, and cheese all mixed up.  I was thinking a scrambled egg looking dish with vegetables and crunchy pieces of potato in it and a bit of melted cheese.  It wasn't quite that.  The home fries were mushy and not crunchy ... more like pieces of boiled potato.  And the vegetables were all a bit undercooked so the onion had more of a bite to it than I was expecting and probably overpowered the eggs.  Overall, I could only taste rawish onions.  I will give it that it was a big dish... so from a quantity perspective, you don't need to order more.  This could easily feed 2 people.  I had to douse it with a bit of hot sauce to tame the onion flavour. 3/5  Overall, it was fast, clean, affordable, and service was good... simple food done quickly and served with a smile.  I would give it a try here again but perhaps not the Mixed Grill!",

The toasted Mancini's bread with a fluffy egg, cheese and your choice of meat hit the spot. I went with bacon, and was rewarded with a delightful marriage of bacon, egg and cheese. I also got a side of shredded potatoes as they are called on the menu, and requested they be covered in cheese. Overall a great lunch. Will certainly be back for more delicious affairs of food.",

No cilantro, chorizo, or anything of flavor or color..! Very disappointing. My husband got the haluski and it was the featured dish. It was better than my tacos but nothing to bring us back.

    "text": "During the course of  exploring the Strip District of the city I was looking forward to having a pub-style lunch somewhere in the area. Unfortunately, the place I was hoping to visit was closed on Sunday (should have checked the listing on yelp!).   I walked into Kelly O's (which must be 180 degrees from a pub setting) to find a bustling diner filled with guests of all ages and descriptions. My server, Andrea, approached the table with 45 seconds and took my order. While tempted to have something from the Sunday extended breakfast menu, I opted for a cup of Turkey Pot Pie soup and \"Classic\" patty melt.   The tasty soup arrived quickly and hot (and I mean HOT!) and included a nice piece of crust and chunk of turkey. The sandwich was also good (hot), rye bread perfectly toasted, good cheese melt and burger cooked to the temperature.  In spite of the business levels and somewhat cramped quarters there was no level of chaos at Kello O's. Instead, servers moved about smoothly while delivering orders and every departing guest was warmly thanked for their visit. The patron mix ranged from children to folks well into their 80's. And, there was an obvious mix of \"regulars\" and first timers like me. Andrea was conversational, refilled my beverage without request and provided me with much appreciated information about the District. By the way, the place,including restroom, was remarkably clean which is saying plenty when considering the number of people that obviously went through the place.   It's nice to visit a place that doesn't try to be \"something they're not.\" The menu is straightforward and genuine, the food is \"as promised,\" the staff is friendly and connected with their customers.  I'll likely visit again with friends and family.",

A few items:  Most of the clientele here is distinctly local.  While I was there, several groups of police officers and firefighters stopped by, some for just take-out service.  When you walk in the door, you can see it is well-lit, clean, and welcoming.  I was a single diner today, and I could not feel more welcomed.  The menu is not overly-extensive (good!) and you can see they concentrate on things they do well.  Extremely fresh ingredients, not overly sauced or salted.  The Mancini Bread tastes amazing - it's a don't miss item and is served with most items.  Service was very friendly and professional - they always kept an eye on me, and I wanted for nothing, but they NEVER intruded when it was clear that I was reading the paper.  It is about 2 blocks past most of the more \"hyped\" areas in the Strip, so it gets way more local folks than the more touristy places like Deluca's, and there was NO line - just a very steady progression of what appear to be local customers.  A great value with great food and service.",

The rush reorder took another 20 minutes - the same time as the original.  I would have appreciated a discount or at least a real apology since I had to sit and watch as my husband ate, but that wasn't the real complaint.  My reorder was still wrong!!

When we were paying however, we were \"sassed\" by another waitress who would not let us pay with a debit card because of their $10 minimum policy.  After explaining to them, that our meal would have been well over $10 had they not messed it up, our paying with a debit card would not be a problem.  She finally went ahead and charged the card and when she returned it, proceeded to rudely lecture us about how they only just opened and that's why the service was slow, and that thy wouldn't make these kinds of allowances for us again in the future.

Coming from the main shopping area, you might not realize this place is even a restaurant. In fact, I almost decided it wasn't but we walked around to the front and saw the door.  Glad we did.  It was a big plus that there was no line for a table.  The place was packed at maybe 10 on Sunday morning, but they got people seated.  This was our second diner breakfast in two days and the best.  The menu is a lot of fun and they remind you Guy Fieri was there with his show, which is kind of cool.   We really didn't try any of the specialty items he tried as we were trying to go healthy for this meal.  We shared an omelet with an assortment of veggies and feta.  It was really good.  The servers tag-teamed the tables, so we had all the attention we wanted.  Prices were reasonable.  I definitely recommend it for a good  breakfast in this very cool neighborhood.",

    "text": "Kelly O's Diner does not disappoint! Their food is amazing!! They have a good selection of both breakfast and lunch meals, although I've only ever tried the breakfast menu. Their home fries are definitely a must when you go to Kelly's, as well as their fresh squeezed orange juice! Kelly's always have a feature board, which my fiance ordered off of today. He ordered the chorizo grill, which I have to say I was a little jealous of it after I tried it! The only cons at Kelly O's are: there is always a long line and the dining room is VERY crowded. Also, I feel that the prices are rather steep for breakfast food. Other than that, it is definitely one of my favorite breakfast spots!",

Truly nothing bad to say about it, just that the day I visited there was a huge wait and a line that started to go out the door. The food is absolutely worth it though!",

Portions were generous bot not over the top like some diners (which I like) Service was just OK.  It was Father's Day Sunday around 8 am and it was not that busy, but it took them a while to greet and seat us.  Also, seemed to take long for them to come and take our order considering how they need to turn the table to accommodate their volume.  Server was on top of refills.  Food was hot and there are a ton of options to choose from.  I would probably go back but there are so many great choices in the Strip - that it just depends on if my other choices had too long of a line or not.  And they have fresh squeezed OJ!",

And how could we not see it?!  One side of the building is completely painted with mural-like images and the words EAT HERE so large that even my wife with eyes just dilated could see it. I took that as an omen, and turned right.  The parking lot is small and maneuvering is tight.  (I might have parked on the sidewalk.)  Today was cold and damp, and I was looking forward to something very hot. The interior is very bright and warm, and noisy in a good way.  You could hear all the voices but not make out anyone's conversations.  I started with coffee which tasted good and was hot.  For breakfast, I got two over easy eggs, bacon, Italian bread, and fresh fruit.  It was very good.  The bread was a treat.  It was about an inch thick with a good crust.  The service was quick, friendly, and unobtrusive.  In short, we had a very pleasant meal and enjoyed our time there.   While sitting we noticed that this place was on Diner's, Drive-ins, and Dives for some lunch items.  We'll be back in Pittsburgh next month, maybe then we'll try lunch!",

The murals and shiny walls definitely stand out, even in the Strip, and the inside looks like a very traditional American diner. Also there's pictures of Guy Fieri all over the place which is funny. That's about it for the nice stuff.  Let me start by saying that I am an extreme eggs benedict lover, and order eggs benedict around half of the time I go out for breakfast or brunch. I was so excited to go here after reading all the reviews recommending the dish. The menu even says they're \"Outstanding\"! Imagine my disappointment when I saw that the eggs weren't even poached, and my further disappointment when I cut open my egg and it wasn't runny at all. SAD. At least the potatoes on the side were fine?  A lot of people do seem to have had a good experience though, so maybe I just ran into an off dish. And maybe I shouldn't have expected so much out of an eggs benedict at a diner.",

They rush you to sit down and order and then they take forever to serve you. We literally ordered eggs and it took 40 minutes to get our food. When we finally asked after 30 minutes we saw them scrambling and realized the kitchen did not have our ticket. They then came and said it's coming right up.. they said it takes over 20 minutes and when the people behind us got their food before us which was pancakes they said it depends on what you order. Not sure how eggs take so long to make. There was never an apology for the long wait. Our server literally took our order and did not come back once. The food was literally basic and nothing special. The breakfast burrito was supposed to be one of their recommend items and it was just ordinary. Don't waste your time here. They boast themselves for being \"world famous\" but the only thing I'd say they're famous for is their terrible service. Two thumbs down!",

We literally waited in our car 15 min before 5am in front of Kelly O's parking lot,not so sure if it would actually be open at 5am, but we're surprised and happy that it did...and on time, too!  The waitress was nice and friendly and not as crabby as we would have thought, given that it was 5am. Our meal was also large and they definitely did not skimp on the serving size.  I saw a few regulars came in as early as before 6am and the waitress recognized and greeted a few by names, too. Overall, a great place for breakfast with its own (and free!) parking lot.

It's located just a stones throw from the hustling center of the Strip and does have a few free parking spots (arrive early to take advantage). For those not fortunate enough to snag a space there is a $5 flat rate lot right next door.  When you enter there is a sign directing you to wait to be seated. You can wait, or try your luck at the counter. You don't need to check in with a host/hostess, just keep your place in line and wait. The waiting area is small, so be prepared to wait outside. The menu is traditional diner fare with a few popular items that stand out. The featured dishes on Triple D are haluski, turkey pot pie soup and mush with bacon. I can't vouch for these choices, but hope to be able to after a return trip. I had the Mancini's French toast (local bread company - amazing), shredded potatoes with onions and peppers and a side of bacon. I also had fresh squeezed orange juice. The French toast was tops, the potatoes were nothing special (no real flavor and the onions and peppers weren't cooked with them very long, just tasted like they were thrown in at the last minute). The bacon was good and the OJ was magical, I just wish it came in a bigger glass and didn't cost over $3.00.  My husband had an omelette and the shredded potatoes, he didn't have any complaints.  As far as a breakfast place in the Strip goes, I prefer Pamela's and DeLuca's over Kelly O's. No signature choices really stood out to me. However, I'm looking forward to returning for some Haluski and turkey pot pie soup and hoping to add another star or two to my review.",

    "text": "I ended up here with my party of 6 for Sunday brunch after the other two places we stopped at along the way had more than an hour wait. No thanks. When we came into Kelly O's, although the tiny restaurant was crowded, there was no wait. Once I heard they were on DDD, I knew this would be good enough for me.  Our waitress was pretty curt, but got the job done. She kept coffee filled, answered any questions we had about the menu, and cleared plates quickly.  I can never eat a lot for breakfast, so I tend to order a couple of little things, and then pick off everyone else's plate. I ordered an English muffin and turkey bacon, and picked at the waffle my fiance ordered, and the Fresh toast my mom ordered. Everything was delicious! Prices were super affordable, too.  By the time we left (around 11 a.m. or so), the place was packed, and there was a decent wait.  I would definitely go back if in Pittsburgh again!",

    "text": "We went to Kelly O's in the Strip for breakfast today.  We had taken the day off work and thought it would be a nice way to start the day.  We had been there before and had always enjoyed the breakfast.  Nothing outstanding but it is always the least crowded breakfast spot in the Strip and has a parking lot so it was a good choice.  After our experience today we will never return.  It was not crowded when we arrived so we immediately got a seat.  After 5 minutes our waitress came and gave us menus and took our drink order.  She delivered our drinks and we placed our order.  After 40 minutes of waiting for our food our waitress came over and told us that the kitchen had lost our order.  She took our order again and told us they would expedite our food.  20 minutes later we finally got part of our meal.  My daughter and I had ordered eggs over easy, bacon, home fries and Italian toast.  My husband had ordered a bacon/cheese omelette, hash browns and rye toast.  We received everything except the hash browns and home fries which ended up arriving 10 minutes later.   As far as the food the Italian toast was cold, there was no cheese in my husband's omelette and our bacon (which had always been good in the past) was only 14 to  1/2 inch wide.  The three pieces put together did not equal the size of a normal piece of bacon.  But at that point we just wanted to leave and enjoy the rest of our day.   What made it worse was that, after telling us that our order had been lost,  our original waitress never said another word to us.  She totally ignored us and was rather rude.  On the bright side the waitress who took over for her was very apologetic and didn't charge us for the meal.  All in all ,a very disappointing meal and we will definitely not return.",

It's just as good.  We mostly stick to the omelettes because they are huge and very tasty. Darnell's Chicken omelette is one of my favorites.  I tried some of the lunch items that were on the DDD show years ago.  The best one was the pot pie soup.  The haluski with bacon had a little bit of a weird taste.  Anyway, I would simply stick to the breakfast items on this menu, that is their specialty and they do them very well.  Another nitpick, they don't have anyone managing the line when you are waiting for a table.  So everyone has to try and figure out who came first and who is next.  It would be great if they just had a pad of paper for people to sign in so there were no discrepancies.   Oh and they won't seat you until your entire party has arrived. Luckily they are NOT cash only like Pamela's.",

Mostly leaving this review for the breakfast fan and French toast connoisseur/-euse, so I'll say I definitely approve of the classic diner atmosphere. Cleaner than the typical classic diner, though, daffodils on the table, and friendly, quick service. French toast was better than I expected since Italian bread isn't optimal for French toast, but I was surprised. Three slices, not flimsy, but probaby could have soaked a little longer. Overall, though, good, and served with plenty of syrup. Silver seal of approval. Have faith, too, that you will find ths place when navigating here. You think you're in a quasi-dilapidated industrial park, but Kelly O's is certainly there and shines a light.",

I received a plate with raw potatoes, over cooked eggs, and yellow syrup that they claimed was Hollandaise sauce.  I sent the dish back.    On the second attempt I asked them to leave off the Hollandaise.  This time I received cold potatoes and undercooked fried eggs - the whites of the eggs were mostly clear.  I asked the waitress why the eggs were fried (if you can it that) instead of poached.  At that point she decided to lecturer me about their kitchen, the cooking methods of their chief, the speed of the wait staff, etc. etc.",

    "text": "I ate here a couple of Saturdays with my girlfriend for a brunch type meal.  We weren't necessary looking to eat at Kelly O's and a long time ago I had eaten at the original one in the North Hills.  However, we were looking for a place to eat in the strip and it caught our attention as we were about to leave the strip and so we decided to stop in and check it out.  The inside of the place is decorated in what most people would consider normal diner decor.  Booths, a counter, knick knacks and many pieces are devoted to their claim to fame of being on \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\".   Whenever we got there the place was full except for a table that had just opened up that a bus boy was cleaning.  He immediately finished cleaning, took our drink orders and a waitress arrived with menus.  I looked it over for a couple of minutes and couldn't find anything that jumped out at me.  Finally I decided on the O.M.G. Breakfast which I got as two scrambled eggs, shredded potatoes, hot sausage and Mancinis toast while my girlfriend had a similarly hard time picking and ended up choosing an omelet.  After we had ordered my girlfriend and I were discussing where she was going to head to brunch with some of her friends in the future and I looked up their menu on my phone.  Talk about food envy!  That is never a good sign whenever your food hasn't even arrived yet and you are already unhappy you didn't go elsewhere.  In any case, 29 minutes later (I normally don't time these things but it was a coincidence that I knew when I ordered and it took a long time) my meal came out.  I wouldn't say OMG about it as it was a sausage patty next to some eggs and hash browns.  After waiting for a minute or two for my girlfriends meal to come out ,she encouraged me to eat mine before it got too cold and so I did.  Finally about 5 minutes after my meal came out she received her omelet.  The sausage and toast were easily the best part of my breakfast as the sausage had some spice and the Mancinis toast was slathered with butter making it really good.  Then there were my eggs and hash browns which seemed to be lacking any seasoning at all and I ended up getting some hot sauce in order to make eating them more enjoyable.  In the end it was a fairly mediocre meal with entirely too long of a wait in my opinion for breakfast food and some bad serving habits (my meal 5 minutes before my girlfriends).  The bottom line for me is that I will not be heading back here in the future.  I will say that was happy with the price of the food but I guess that you often get what you pay for and that combined with the general slowness made for a not so great experience.  I do believe that my experience the first time in the North Hills one was much better though.",

    "text": "Kelly O's got that spunk that drives people in and wanting to try more. We came around 11am and there were ample of (self) seating. Despite hearing that the place was featured in Diners, Driveins and Dives for a select menu, we opted to try the lunch and breakfast menus over Guy Fieris selection - sorry GF! We decided on the Philly hoagie and the Pittsburgh Benedict because we wanted all of Pennsylvania on the table (jk). But on the real, the benedict was so damn good. It is like any traditional Benedict but with a slamming creamy rich hollandaise sauce. Eggs were perfectly cooked still with yolk oozing onto the Italian toasts. We added peppers and onions onto the hash (which was another $2.50) but the hash was perfectly cooked - slight crunch on the outside, your standard starchy soft shredded potato on the inside.   Philly hoagie was excellent. Buns were toasted with butter that gave it an extra rich flavor, despite the already savory beef, gooey cheese, and grilled veggies. They add some sort of mayo on it that tops it off with some creaminess. It came with a pickle and side of fries, which by the way came slightly later because it was fried fresh and golden to perfection. Because we are the \"go big or go home\" type of couple, we decided to end with a small dessert - the raisin French toast since it was so highly praised in prior reviews. It lived up to its review. It came out hot with the icing melting on top with a hint of cinnamon, and some maple  syrup which was moderately sweet. Service was fast and excellent. Portions were quite generous and hearty (so much so that the table behind us took pictures of their plates because they ordered way too much). Takes credit card but i believe a minimum of $9. Private parking lot available. I was never a breakfast or brunch type but I might have converted.",

We were seated right away and there wasn't a line outside. There were a handful of empty tables and there were only two customers at the bar side. Once it hit 10am, there was a LONG line outside and people it got SUPER busy!   We were going to order from the menu, but there was a board with \"specials\" so we decided to go with the choices on the board. (Our mistake not to ask about the prices in advance)... We assumed the specials were about the same price as what they had on the menu, but it was actually a lot more... if you're interested in the specials, make sure you ask how much it is first...   We ordered the Cajun CBG Omelette (which ended up being $16) and Strawberry bread french toast (which was about $12). We also ordered a side of bacon (which was $4). I will say, everything was pretty good. The Cajun CBG omelette actually had thick chunks of REAL chicken and the Strawberry bread french toast had actual fresh strawberries. The one down side about the omelette is that the cheese inside tasted like Kraft cheese singles (it wasn't very good).   Other than that, everyone was super friendly and the food was very fresh. I'm not sure if our breakfast was worth $40 though (including coffee too), but I think if you order from the regular menu, it would be worth it. :)",

It's just regular diner food, nothing extraordinary. My friends were already here eating when I arrived late and wanted to get something to go. I had to flag down a waiter to get my order in (which by the way was rude). I ordered a steak salad to go. My salad took probably like 20 minutes to make. When I got home, I realized that the cheese was melted on top of everything. It wasn't bad but unexpected. The salad itself was okay. It was a mixed of greens with tomatoes and cucumbers and fries of course!  Pro: they have their own parking lot which is the biggest perk since it's hard finding parking in the strip district.",

The coffee was so fucking good as well (just like every diner). Our waitress was cool af, never got her name tho. My friend found some type of piece of fuzz in her water so that's why we give 4 stars. Also they used regular straws what I am not okay with BUT they followed the health code violation & didn't put the straw in the cup for us. I recommend.",

From the second we arrived the staff did their best to accommodate us.  We had a bit of a wait and they kept checking back with us and letting us know we'd get seated.  So nice!  Once we were seated, fresh hot coffee arrived immediately.  Servers were funny, energetic, and helpful.    The menu.  Wow.  So many options.  It was hard to decide!  They serve Mancini's bread...which is amazing.  I ordered the Pittsburgh Benedict.  Mancini's bread, kielbasa, pirogies, eggs, and hollandaise.  A side of potatoes.  So. Delicious.  Everyone at the table was happy and no one shared!!  Next time I have to try the polish hand grenade!  Halushki, pirogies, and kielbasa in a burrito!  Whoa nelly!!",

The French toast was thick and fluffy however, the edges and top of the bread was crispy. This blended perfectly with the maple syrup. The bacon was also thick and full of flavor and the perfect amount of saltiness.   The customer service was wonderful, the server was very kind with a lovely sense of humor. The atmosphere also reminded me of an old 50s diner. The decor is what you expect from a diner, however it definitely helped me feel welcome.   I was a little shocked at how the bill was. The food is priced a little more then what I would expect, the friend I dined with ordered pancakes and bacon with some coffee- and I ordered some raisin pancakes, side of bacon and an apple juice. The total was around $36 not including tip. I was expecting regular diner prices however, I would say it is worth the slight price upgrade because the meal was certainly better then typical diners I have tried in the past.",

After eating here my boyfriend and I made a pact to never go back to Pamela's and everyone we have brought completely agrees.   The one downside like many of these diners is they do get busy but the line does move super quickly because the staff works so hard to get everyone in and out in a timely manner. You also need your full party there to be seated.   Last time we went I got the famous breakfast which is 2 eggs any way and your choice of 2 meats and it comes with Italian bread, you can also choose your side of potatoes or fruit. My boyfriend got a dish that has 2 eggs, 2 meats, and 2 sweets.  Everything is super filing and at a good price the only disadvantage is they do charge for every little thing so if you want extra Hollandaise sauce that's +1.99. Catch us there every weekend in the morning!!",

You want great dining on a budget, then look no further.   Previously featured on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives, Kelly O's is nothing short of perfect. Great, fun, fast paced service and fresh, hearty plates are what make Kelly O's special. Try the Mixed grill served with home fries, fresh eggs, peppers, onions and your choice of cheese to top it. Yum!   Im always amazed at how Kelly O's continues to make dining simple ane easy, but still have it all taste so well at such a cheap price. However thry do it, I hope that they don't change.",

Their food is really good, I just wonder why the waitress made it sound like my potatoes came with onions and pepper when I was charged $1 extra for them.  She did the same to my husband with his pancakes, he was charged a $1 extra for the bananas.  We don't mind getting add ons, but the way she phrased it, you'd think that was part of the meal. Not cool.  I ordered Vegetarian Eggs Benedict which came with homefries. It does say about adding mushrooms for 50 extra, nothing about onions and peppers being lavishness.   The coffee was on our table at light speed, the food at a reasonable time since they were so busy. Parking is plenty on a Sunday. We may come back.",

The hostess and wait staff were super friendly and accommodating.  The place was busy, but the wait time was short.  I ordered the polenta bolognese and iced tea.  I never had to ask for a drink refill, which is great thing.   The sauce was common, but tasty and well seasoned, and the ice cream scoop-sized polenta balls were firm and soaked up the bolognese for a tasty mix.  The serving size was large for the price, I couldn't finish.  I'd go again, if in the area, but not on a regular basis.",

    "text": "I'm guessing people from Pittsburgh are super picky about their diners.  Being from the South, you don't generally find a whole lot of places like these that aren't massive chain stores. So when I'm in different parts of the country, I make it a point to stop into almost every place that Guy Fieri visits. Out of the 40-odd places I've visited, I've not raved about one. This place will not make two.   I arrived after the big breakfast rush, but before the lunch crowd arrived. The place wasn't packed, all three of the waitresses were super helpful, my coffee stayed hot and fresh, and they made certain that I knew what I was doing when I ordered. I ordered the Gregory's Favorite, and the biscuits and white sausage gravy were almost as good as my grandmother's. The eggs were perfectly scrambled, the hash was covered in peppers and onion, and I barely got the word \"hot\" out of my mouth before the waitress flashed three bottles of hot sauce at me and let me pick one. I took photos and mailed them back to my Army buddies, and the string of curse words hurled my direction made the food nearly perfect. Nothing like jealousy to make a visit perfect.   Long story short, if you avoid the super-packed times, this place is worth the word of mouth spread about it. The food is plentiful, the staff was excellent, and I look forward to dragging the boys in sometime and listen to them validate my thoughts - that this place was GOOD!!",

It is all of 1000 ft from my front door in the strip and I've stopped in a few times for an early breakfast during the week ( before 7 AM...) they are usually busy, and have only one hostess/waitress working from what I understand  before 8 AM. This can be a bit of a drag if you're in a bit of a hurry.  As for their food, I've only had the protein breakfast which is a few nice scrambled eggs and either sweet or hot sausage made fresh on site. The sausages are very good. This spot is A-OK!",

The waitress who seated us was super friendly and even got our drinks started. The waitress for our table was not very friendly. She came to ask for our drink order and we tried to tell her that it was already taken and she unpleasantly said something along the lines of she was our server and she'd need our order. So we ordered the drinks again and had to have he tell our server she had gotten them already. This was our first visit and we were having trouble deciding exactly what to get. Our server was not very helpful and seemed annoyed when we asked for her opinion while placing our order.  The orange juice is fresh squeezed to order- and was delicious. I ordered \"Seana's Favorite\" which was two eggs, two meats, and two sweets. I chose double bacon for the meat and the French toast for the sweet. Overall the breakfast tasted good and I would return. They were super quick to clear dirty dishes. Service could definitely have been friendlier and more helpful but wasn't necessarily rude either.",

    "text": "Typical diner with a good breakfast that is reasonably priced but nothing that really wowed me.   First off, despite reading reviews I was confused about the line to get in.  Unlike Deluca's, there wasn't a clear cut line out front but that's how you were supposed to be seated (first come, first serve assuming your whole party was present).  There were people milling around outside the front door, and then people crammed in the small entryway in no sensible order.  I couldn't tell if we were cutting ahead of people or what.  Once we were through the line and seated, we ordered your standard breakfast.  Two over medium eggs, wheat toast, potatoes and turkey bacon for me and biscuits and gravy for my fiance with over easy eggs.   Both our eggs came out too well done to be over easy or medium and his shredded potatoes had zero seasoning and flavor.  He didn't even eat most of them, which is a rarity.  My home fries, on the other hand, were well seasoned and crisp (very tasty).  All in all, met our breakfast craving and was a lot of food for a good price but, for me, there are other diners in town that serve better food for the same price.",

But I like that they have a parking lot.  Even though they are very busy the servers are always very nice.  I never feel rushed to eat my meal even though there is a long line of people waiting.  Overall I feel this is a good spot to eat at. The price is right, the service and food are good. I haven't tried lunch yet but I'm sure it's delicious.",

I've eaten plenty of other things there and I suppose they were all o.k., but I don't remember them. I don't remember anything about the waitstaff or the price (though I'm sure they were fine).  All I remember is the haluski, every time. The haluski is fabulous.  If you've been there and not tried the haluski, perhaps you should write your own review, but you have to go back.  Every bit as good as the original Kelly-o's, which is a much longer drive from downtown. I suppose everyone should drive out to the original at least once, but everything about the new downtown location is True to the original.  Did I mention the haluski?",

I've had their chicken salad (which is HUGE and delish), their Haluski (a Pittsburgh favorite and one of the items featured on diners, drive ins and drives- sooo good! If you ask, you can order it in a half portion which is what I like to do! A half portion is still a ton) and this past weekend I ordered shawna's breakfast. This breakfast platter was your choice of either one pancake or French toast, eggs, bacon, and then a choice of either extra bacon, sausage links, sweet sausage or hot sausage. I ordered egg whites, French toast and sweet sausage with bacon strips too! All of that was under $8 and was super delicious!   My boyfriend always gets the western omelette and loves it. Their home fries are house made (not frozen) and are awesome. They also serve Mancini's toast (a local favorite)!   Kelly O's is the perfect place to go for breakfast on a Saturday or Sunday morning before a walk through the strip! I've never had to wait in any lines when arriving, which is a nice alternative to Deluca's (which is always packed). Friendly and fast service each time I went as well!",

Most of the restaurant was empty since it was a Friday at 1:30pm, so we didn't have to wait long for our food at all. I got the world famous breakfast with sausage patties and home fries (should've gotten the shredded potatoes, I later realized). It also came with eggs and Mancini's toast. The sausage looked a little burnt and dry, but they were good. Everything else was pretty much up to standard for typical breakfast/brunch food. The best part of the meal though were the cinnamon rolls we ordered to share. So good. I usually don't like cinnamon rolls, but these were amazing. Best I've ever had. Wasn't too happy with the presentation of our food. It seemed like everything was just piled on carelessly, especially the side of shredded potatoes my friend got that was served all on one side of the plate. Then again it's a diner so what can you expect. I did, however, appreciate that the diner was much cleaner than its competitors (no sticky tables). I'm expecting to return since the friends I came here with love Kelly O's, but next time I think I'm going to just order a bunch of the cinnamon rolls.

Kelly O's definitely has an authentic diner atmosphere. From our seat at the counter we had a great view of the kitchen. They were slammed but managing it well!   Food was great! I ordered the daily special of the Kielbasa and Swiss Mixed Grill. My father had the Cinnamon Raisin french toast. One of the best mixed grills I've ever had! We are big breakfast people and the food is 5-star. Took awhile to get our order, but that's more due to our poor timing (we could clearly see the kitchen staff busting their butts to fill orders).  Waitstaff was friendly. Handled an unruly/rude customer better than I would have. Kelly O's is right up there with Deluca's and Pamela's for me. Seemed a little less touristy which was nice!  I would come back here for breakfast.   **** I highly recommend the fresh squeezed orange juice! I could drink a gallon of it in one sitting. So refreshing!",

We stayed a walking distance from the strip and wanted to originally dine at DeLuca's.  The line for that place was out the door and down the street.  What seemed like a disaster of a walk ended up being a blessing.  We found Kello O's further down the strip.  It was packed for Sunday breakfast.  We waited maybe 20 minutes for a table.  I got a chocolate milk to drink.  It was the best chocolate milk I ever had.  It tasted like a cold melted Wendy's frosty.  Amazing.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy.  I think it was called Greg's Favorite?  Well its my favorite now.  The biscuits had a perfect crispy outside and soft fluffy inside.  I can't describe how flavorful the gravy was.  I wanted to lick my plate clean.    It also came with eggs which were cooked perfect to my liking.  I don't like moist eggs and they somehow read my mind and cooked them dry.    The shredded potatoes were a perfect complement to them.  Crispy and also flavorful.  And I have no idea how True this is but a lady outside stopped us trying to leave and said 25% of proceeds went to Ronald McDonald House.  Best breakfast ever and some of my bill went to charity?

No gross monstrosity burgers here. Just honest, thin, old-fashioned diner burgers where you can actually taste the beef. But you can load them up if you want. Try their breakfast sandwiches too. Their biscuits are phenomenal. I am sorry to report that I can't comment on other dishes because I'm stuck in my ways. I'm sure everything else is delicious too.

I don't know how anyone could eat all that food and still function.  Fabulous. Delicious. Yummy. Filling. Ridiculous. The cost for the omlette and 2 waters was $15. We left almost a 35% tip because we were that happy with the experience.  So good.",

Great place to take the family, something for everyone on the menu. Will definitely be back when my parents are in town.",
