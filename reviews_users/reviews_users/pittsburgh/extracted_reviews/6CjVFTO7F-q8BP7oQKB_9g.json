    "text": "After a visit to the Phipps Conservatory, we headed to an area in Oakland, home of some campus-type fare (it's near U Pitt and Carnegie Mellon). Ali Baba was the place of choice, as my two friends had been there years past and had fond memories.  The establishment wasn't very crowded when we got there at about 6, but afterward, it filled in, mostly with college students. But what a find. We ordered the maza platter that had hummus, baba ghanooj, artichoke and tabooli salads, feta cheese, olives and tomatoes, as well as pita bread. G ordered lentil soup (very tasty but a little different from what I'm used to), and we all ordered the lamb shank, which was in a light tomato sauce and came with rice with pignolia nuts. G ordered some kind of wheat dessert.  The variety of goodies on the platter was outstanding, especially the homemade hummus and artichoke salad, and I'm glad we ordered it. The lamb shank? The only other time I ordered it was at Evvia, in Palo Alto, CA. For  1/2 the price and twice the amount, we had a delicious meal. The meat fell off the bone and the rice was scrumptious. I had leftovers for the following evening.  The wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The only thing that ruined an otherwise fantastic experience was the lady sitting in the next table. She should have cooled it on the perfume.   I don't give 5 stars often, but this place deserves it. If I had room for dessert, I would have ordered Baklava, which would have been amazing, am sure, but it would also have wiped the taste of the lamb from my palate. Maybe next time. I will be back when I'm in the area again.",

    "text": "I was an undergraduate at Pitt when this place opened, I believe it was in 1972. Middle Eastern food scared me back then but within a year, I was hooked. I've been out of the Pittsburgh area since 1980 but have made a tradition of having at least one meal here each time I come back. It's great for my vegetarian husband who can always find plenty of food that he likes. I usually get a chicken kabob, a salad, and some rice. Hummus is a given and (if I'm really hungry or planning on stretching the meal out into another meal for the next day), an order of felafel as well. Parking has always been an issue in Oakland, but we found a pay spot about a block away so no problem. I've never had a bad meal here and enjoy making it a part of my visits when I'm back in the 'burgh.",

A graduate student took me here the weekend I came up to interview for my graduate program. The place is a great little hole in the wall in Oakland that is perfect for lunch or dinner. As a vegetarian, there were a bunch of yummy items on the menu that are relatively cheap. Here, though, I always go back to the falafel, which is incredible. It's good enough to prevent me from trying other stuff on the menu. Furthermore, the hummus/pita is another highlight. I know I can always stop in a have a good meal here.",

My favorite is the a la carte option. Some of my favorites include the spinach and lentil soup, the spinach pie, and the falafel. The falafel is different from others in which it is one falafel topped with a thick tahini like spread. Two a la carte dishes are easily under $10, and you leave feeling full and happy for days.  Great spot for a quite dinner! It is BYOB with a corking fee.",

    "text": "This is my first review.  I felt compelled to write about my experience since there are some not so stellar reviews posted here and I do not agree... at all.  Because my friend and I were going to Oakland for a lecture at The Carnegie Music Hall, we decided to make a day of it and go to the Spring Flower Show at Phipps and then have time for dinner between the close of flower show at 5 pm and before the 7:30 pm lecture.  The flower show was great!!  Sorry that I do not go to Phipps more often.  So we decided Craig Street made sense for dinner .. for $6 parked at The Carnegie parking lot after leaving our free spot near Phipps.  I had done some checking out on Yelp to see what might be a good dinner choice.  I was surprised to see some less than good reviews of Ali Baba as I had always had very good food there and do very much like the Mediterranean menu and had always had very pleasant dining experience there in the past ....  but had not been there for a few years....  So by experience,  knowing how often it can be smart to ignore reviews we decided to go to Ali Baba since Mediterranean is generally healthy and has lots of choices and hard not to be in the mood for pita bread and hummus and baba ghanooj ....and then to go from there ... be it vegetarian or meat or a combination.  It was cold so we were happy to get out of the cold and order hot tea and bread, hummus and baba ghanooj while we waited for my daughter to join us for dinner.  We ordered the large size since we were going to share ... the bread, the hummus and the baba ghanooj were absolutely as good or better than I have ever had ... and I have been to many Mediterranean restaurants ... and better than what I make on my own from scratch at home.  Wish I could get the secrets to their recipes!  And the large size was larger than we expected.  My friend and I enjoyed our tea and appetizers and when my daughter arrived we ordered a variety from the a la carte menu.  We shared and enjoyed a Fatoosh sald, rice and pignolia nuts, Bazila, Loobee, and chicken shish kebab along with a second basket of warm pita bread, and more hummus and baba ghanooj since the serving size was more than generous.  We shared and everything was absolutely delicious and my daughter was presented with a large bag of leftovers to take home which included everything except the fatoosh plus baklawa to go.  We arrived early for dinner when there were few diners and few tables were occupied ...  when we left the restaurant was full with some waiting for a table ... but we never felt rushed.  Our server/waitress was enthusiastic, friendly and efficient ... even bringing more bread and additional hot water for our tea bags ... that was a nice touch! Could not have been happier!!  And lecture was great too!!  Our bill was just under $60.00 for three very satisfied diners and a take-home dinner for a day or two with dessert for my daughter.  Based on our dining experience ... 5 stars!! for sure!",

    "text": "What food I got to taste was...not optimum. I came in at 1:15PM and the place was nearly empty. I hadn't eaten all day and was ravenous- also moved recently from NY Metro area and missed having a good gyro.  It took awhile to get noticed by the waitress- in an almost empty restaurant. I had a book so I read. I noticed 2 tables who'd come in after me being served- while I also noticed my waitress heading toward the front door not to reappear for 15 minutes. During that 15 minutes I imagined my lunch under a heat lamp.  When she finally came back, she went to the station. Finally she noticed me- and went back to the kitchen.     After maybe 5 or 10 minutes she came out. I took one bite. My gyro had big uneven slabs of meat- which were barely warm. Cold pita- a few crumbs of feta (I ordered it extra) and some runny sauce on the bottom- and big pieces of raw onion.    I really think she forgot to give my ticket to the kitchen- but even for the time she was in there- who gives cold pita on a gyro? Or can't slice the meat and cook it?   When I told her it was cold- she took it back and told me they were making a new one. At this point it had been 35 minutes- and I really only had an hour and had to go so I told her to cancel the order.  She \"apologized\" by blaming the kitchen.  As I left- I offered to pay for my undrunk glass of milk- and told the owner about the service.  Instead of anything close to an apology- he told me no one else had ever complained about that before. TERRIBLE service and mediocre to bad food.    I went across the street and got some NY pizza which had a great crust and rivaled anything I've gotten in Manhattan.",

That is because they usually get appetizers, such as the awe-inspiring Muhummara, a delicious dip made from walnuts, paprika, and (as internet recipes indicate) pomegranate molasses. They have pathetically tried to make it on their own a few times, to no success. Baba Ghanooj is also a wonderful appetizer choice. Our owners often just share a variety of small eats, rather than choosing more expensive and, in their opinions, less bountiful entrees. The value per dollar of the entrees, together with the occasional negligent/unfriendly service, are the reasons for not awarding all 5 stars. Thanks! Meow.",

I'm saving the baklava for later, but the other two dishes were excellent. The soup was freaking awesome, seriously. It had maybe a little too much oil, but otherwise, it was very tasty. The entree had rice (not memorable), hummus (okay), and baba ganouj (excellent). Yeah, you could totally taste the grilled eggplant goodness of the baba ganouj. I would definitely at least add a side dish of this if you eat here.",

It was a fine experience, but nothing special.  I patiently waited in line to order takeout, and got the spinach and lentil soup and the spinach pie, both highly recommended.  The soup was definitely the better of the two, with a strong lemon juice flavor as I usually make it myself.  The spinach pie, rumored to be so good, was a real let down.  Another reviewer called it \"best in the country\"?  Cmon, are you serious?  If I came here again I would definitely get the kibbee or something.  I couldn't help but notice the mass confusion at the counter, either, between the owner and the waitresses.  The takeout ordering system, which should honestly be quite easy, was causing many problems and making everyone a bit awkward.  They couldn't match the tickets with the completed orders with the ticket copies sent back to the kitchen.    Considering the other options for lunch in the area, I do recommend Ali Baba.  Next time I go, maybe I will have a better experience, but the thought that their quality hinges so much on what you order doesn't make me feel better.",

You will get large portions and pay little, if you choose from the a la carte menu instead of the platters. I would recommend getting a few a la carte items.   The baba ghanooj is my favorite. So is the spinach and lentil soup, which has a very unique taste with lemon juice. So is the kibbe; one of the best I have had ever. So is the halwa bi-jibin (which is dessert made of dough, pistachios, and rose water). There was one point in time I was addicted to this dessert.   The \"healthy variety\" and \"vegetarian special\" are combination dishes, which are even better deals. I usually replace the hummus in the special with baba ghanooj since I think their baba ghanooj is a lot better. Grape leaves are OK, but the veggie version is  not as good.  The portions are large enough that if you get three items, you will likely have stuff to take home. And some items (dips) come with pita bread.   I often take out from Ali Baba, and they have always been timely.  My girlfriend says the open faced hummus pita is excellent, but Ihave not tried it.   The only bad experience I had: mousakka is not real mousakka. It feels synthetic. Don't even try it.",

Two dishes I had never tried before and loved were the fatoosh (a salad similar to tabooli) and mohomara (a delicious spicy dip made with ground walnuts and paprika. It was so flavorful and meaty, it could fool any meat lover into thinking they're eating ground beef!)  We also had a spinach pie and a meat pie with ground lamb. The dough was very flaky, but I was not thrilled by the spices in either pie.  I would still give this place another try and explore some of their other dips and entrees.",

The best thing about Ali Baba, is the font used for the restaurant name; it adds to the character and appeal in a way that I feel unable to explain.",

It's a nice atmosphere. The service was fine.  The main reason I am rating this place two stars is their pitas. I had an gyro and my sister got pitas with her meal, and in both cases, the texture was reminiscent of cardboard. They weren't particularly warm, either. Aside from that, though, my gyro was average, as was most of the other food we got (stuffed cabbage, student special). The baba ghanooj was particularly fantastic; it had a great smoked flavor.  I might return if I'm in the mood for some Middle Eastern food since it's so close, but I probably won't be missing this place anytime soon.",

    "text": "I'd think most of my Yelp buddies won't care about this review, but oh well! It was way overdue.   This place is really close to my (former) school and some of the communities at school loved to throw events there or bring their foods at school events. So, I have tried most of their foods either inside the restaurant or at school.   This is supposed to be a Syrian cuisine but you'll find some Persian foods in their menu such as shish kabob or koobideh (Kafta). And sure, I've heard so much arguments about whether or not Shish kabob or koobideh are Persian, so don't contact me on this unless you have a time machine that can send me back to see it for myself.    Generally speaking, their rice is bland, their beef is dry, and Spinach pie is meh. I like their pitta bread, lentil soup, and tossed salad. Fatoosh is also a hit or miss...   I haven't heard of any other middle eastern restaurant near that area and if you really crave this kind of food, I'd suggest to go here but don't expect much. Service is friendly but inefficient.   The location is great and its nice and clean... It has been there since 1972 and is pretty popular. It is also big enough compare to other restaurants in the Craig street. And you can have a nice walk around it when you are done eating! There are coffee shops, bookstore, boutiques, people walking, etc!",

Granted, are reservation was for 5:30, had it been later in the evening, when they are potentially busier, it could have been a different story. Regardless of our party size, everyone enjoyed the food! I had a curry lamb stew that was perfect, while the table shared a variety of appetizers. Several people got the falafel and it was ginormous. I don't know if I'd come back here for dinner, as I've more so enjoyed this as a lunch spot. Granted, the full dinner menu is quite appealing, but I'm more of a fan of the a la carte items.",

For some reason, I have turned into a baba ganoush fanatic lately.  The baba at Ali Baba (say that 3 times in a row and a genie will appear) was very fresh tasting but was a little bit on the bland side in my opinion.  There was a little too much oil (actually a puddle of oil) on top of the baba but there was some nice citrus taste to it.   The large portion of baba was definitely enough for 2 - I brought half of it home.  I also tried a spinach pie.  Good - not great.  Nice and toasted on the outside but just a tad undercooked and doughy on the inside.  Also a little on the bland side.  I wish they had a spinach-feta cheese pie option on the menu - maybe I should have asked.  My last trip to Ali Baba was over 10 years ago.  That visit included an incredibly hilarious and embarassing moment that I cannot post on the internet.  Well maybe one of these days after a few beers I will reveal - ha ha.    Ali Baba is a good choice on Craig Street but there are better middle eastern choices in my opinion at Kassab's (Southside) and Taza 21 (Squirrel Hill).  With that said, I will try Ali Baba again one of these days.  I am intrigued that Ali Baba has it's roots in Syria so maybe I just need to appreciate the differences and give it another chance.",

While the hummus, salad and rice were good, I didn't think much of the lamb, which seemed a little dry and just not tasty. I ordered it rare, which is what my waitress recommended. I feel it could have either been marinated more or with a better marinade.  Since the service was good and friendly, I decided to bump my rating up to three stars. For a restaurant that specializes in this cuisine, however, and the lamb being a major portion of the meal, I expect better.",

It came exactly how the menu described it: rice with pine nuts, hummus and baba ghanooj.  But I was still taken aback by the beige-ness of the plate--when I think \"vegetarian,\" I think green.  (I don't know.  Am I crazy?)  Maybe a tiny bit of salad on the plate?  The plate is less expensive than the meat platters that come with salad--but I'd think that the meat, not lettuce, accounts for the price difference.  But, to be fair, the menu description didn't promise a salad.    The baba ghanooj was the best thing on the vegetarian platter.  The hummus and rice weren't bad, but next time I'll just order the baba ghanooj a la carte and some other small dishes.  I prefer Aladdin's for its larger variety of vegetarian dishes, though.  The water glasses here are really, really small.  I came here on a warm day and my friend and I were really thirsty, so we kept draining our glasses.  Our waitress was pretty good about refilling them--but I couldn't help but think it'd be a lot easier on her if the place had bigger glasses.   Less waste, more eco-friendly, maybe?",

Our table split one order of hummus and one order of baba ghanouj, and I had the syrian style chicken sandwich.  The hummus and baba were very tasty.  The syrian style chicken sandwich was more of a burrito than a sandwich... a burrito densely packed with deliciously spiced shredded chicken and oniony goodness!  It was a huge portion for lunch, a steal at only $5.95.  I could barely move after I had my share of the dips followed by this sandwich.  The food here is decent and you get lots of bang for your buck. I deem this one of the better lunch options on Craig Street, though I guess that is not saying too much!",

My favorites include the Syrian soup, tossed salad, tabouli, hummus, chicken sandwich, kebab, grape leaves and halawa bi-jibin for dessert.  The only thing I wouldn't recommend is the falafel.  It's fine, but their other options are stellar so it's better to branch out.  The owners are friendly and responsible.  I have had a few negative experiences with service over the years, but servers have been excellent in the last few months. Prices are really reasonable too, so you can try a few different options without breaking the bank.",

Bland, over cooked and greasy. Just three tiny pieces of meat (about 1.5 bites total) and some canned peas in greasy tomato sauce. Greasy lettuce garnished with a single slice of tomato. They couldn't even bother to give me a fork despite asking for one twice.  Not going back here again. Disgusting, they should be ashamed of serving such disgusting and overprice food.",

The \"sleek\" (kale with carmelized onion) is my favorite, and so is the falafel (it comes in a large patty.)  I like to order falafel with a side of sleek, and roll it into the pita that comes with the meal - it makes a nice wrap that is both filling and (I imagine) healthy.  The chicken kabob was also very tender and juicy, the hummus is good, and the pita served with the meal has always been warm and fresh.  I will continue to try more dishes here, when I am in the area.",

The Raw Kibbie is a must try: it's raw lamb meat and it is to die for. If you like Sushi, you'd like this.

In any case, the chicken and rice were both fairly unmemorable, as well as a bit expensive. In particular, the chicken was way over-sauced and the rice rather dry. The pita bread was pretty meh as well. And for some reason the waitress seemed a bit out of it (maybe because it was late and a cold day).  Probably wouldn't come back here; I got a much better vibe from say Aladdin in Squirrel Hill.",

First, if you have a strict hour for lunch, this is not the place to come. Service is not a priority. You will be brought your food and not much else and need to ask for a check. This part could really be improved.  We were in the, mostly deserted, restaurant for an hour and fifteen minutes, and we rushed the waitress.  She was sitting at a table playing on her phone for most of our lunch.  The Falafil Wrap ($6.45) was OK.  The falafil part was yummy, but the pita was slightly chewy, which was odd.  As others have mentioned the tahini sauce here was a bit more unique and very savory.  I found it too be almost sour tasting but not in a bad way.  Unfortunately, it was a bit over-powering for the wrap and would have been better on the side.  All in all, a cheap and decent stop for lunch on Craig Street but not terribly special.",

For my entree, I had the chicken delight which was marinated chicken in tomato sauce and sliced onions. I liked the juiciness of the chicken and it was cooked pretty well in my opinion. If there was one thing I would change, however, is to add some spice to the tomato sauce.   The pita bread was moist which helped with scooping up the tomato sauce from my plate.   I don't live in the Pittsburgh area, sadly, but plan to come back to Ali Baba again whenever I visit Pittsburgh.",

I have always come for dinner but at different times; earlier it's empty, but it can get pretty packed during prime dinner hours. I've tried the meat pie, spinach pie, stuffed cabbage, baked kibbee, kafta kebab (spiced ground lamb meat), hummus, and baklava. The kafta kebab is a solid choice, but several other restaurants serve better kafta. I enjoyed the baked kibbee, but thought it was overpriced like most other items on the menu. Everything else I've tried I have regretted ordering. On top of the subpar food, the service is slow. It's extra annoying because you can literally see the staff chatting among themselves instead of attending to customers. I usually eat here with the same friend and she often has a meeting to catch after dinner, but she's always had to leave before me because it takes forever to get the check. A couple things at Ali Baba are worth trying if you haven't been before, but I will not be wasting my time here anymore.  Taste | 2 Atmosphere | 2.5 Presentation | 2 Service | 2 OVERALL | 2",

    "text": "Ali Baba is an Oakland, Craig Street landmark.  With a menu filled with healthy, delicious and innovative selections a 5 star rating is a given.  However, there are many other distinguishing features of this restaurant that are worth note.  Foremost is the affordability of the menu items.  For me student days are a long ago memory, but the search for value on a student budget still resonates.  It is for this reason that it is wonderful to have a place of Ali Baba's Ilk located close to major university campuses.  Bravo to them for keeping high quality at reasonable prices. At Ali Baba it is possible to have a simple nutritious meal or a veritable feast.  Their Baba Ghanooj is the best in the city.  Meat or spinach pies are always tasty.  On a cold day how about some Syrian or Spinach an Lentil soup? My personal favorite is baked kibbee soaked in hot sauce or a milder version served with cucumber and mint yogurt.  The Ali cheeseburger, made with lamb meat and served on pita bread is like none that you have ever had. For the feast, bring some friends to share.  Rice with pignoli nuts is simple and unique.  Kebabs, stuffed cabbage or grape leaves are great lunch or dinner fare.  Healthy, tasty vegetable selections include a variety of salads, the Tabooli salad with bulger wheat and a lemon juice dressing is primo. Don't forget dessert.  All their desserts sound wonderful, but I've only had Baklawa, why stray?  Of course you should order Arabic coffee. There is frequent staff turnover,  but all are enthusiastic, friendly and very efficient.  Get there off rush and be sure to be to class on time.  The owners treat guests like family.  Location can't be beat.  If you are traveling in from the burbs you are walking distance to universities, museums, places of worship ... Ali Baba also offers take-out and delivery to satisfy that craving in your own house if so chosen.   For combination of taste quality, value and convenience Ali Baba receives my highest rating.  Enjoy!!!",

We visited today and they have made some clumsy changes to the interior. It looks like replacing the floor had a snowball effect and the interior just feels less comfortable, noisier, and actually kind of cheap and cruddy. We're sad.",

An order of hummus, baba ghanooj, grape leaves, and a cheese pie is incredibly satisfying and puts our total bill under $30. Apart from the delicious food, there's something to be said about the atmosphere of Ali Baba. Gorgeous pothos plants hang from the skylights of the otherwise minimalist dining room. And on a weekend evening, you may notice that certain customers exude a familiarity and comfort level which indicates they've been going to Ali Baba for years. Its reputation as an Oakland landmark is well deserved.",

We definitely didn't make it back to work in an hour, but don't tell my boss that.   I got the falafel wrap and my friend ordered the lunch combo. Everything was delicious.  i asked for tzaziki sauce instead of tahini and our server looked at me astonishingly.  Whatever, it's what I like! We also got the hummus appetizer, which took entirely too long to be brought out. It, and the pita, were very good and flavorful however. The hummus is very smoky, which is new for me. I liked it.   Lunch prices were on par with the other restaurants in the area. The ambiance and decor was nice yet still leaning towards average. I will definitely go back and/or place an order for pick up. I love falafel and while this wasn't in my top 3, it was still delicious.",

Spending 3 hours in the museum really worked up an appetite and were craving Mediterranean food. We Yelped and found Ali Baba's so decided to go here.   The restaurant is in a cute area of town and is quite charming itself. They were not busy when we went in so we received service immediately. Our server was excellent and was able to point out the vegan and vegetarian options. My husband and I both had the lentil soup as a starter. OMG! It was delicious. I really should have had a bowl of it as it was pure heaven.   For our appetizer we had a falafel sandwich. Now it is typically a plate but they made it a sandwich for us. It was delicious. There was falafel in every bite which is not my experience with other restaurants serving falafel.   At the end of the day I will say this is one of, if not, the best Mediterranean restaurants around.",

The grape leaves were delicious. The leaves were tender and the filling was flavorful. The gyro was just okay, not a whole lot of flavor, and the pita was a little tough. I think some onions/feta would help improve and maybe some hot sauce.   I've also had stuffed cabbage rolls before and enjoyed them, though they were a bit on the sour side and not enough on the savory side. I think my favorite thing on the menu is the spinach and cheese pie, which is utterly delicious. Their hummus is great.   I also can say the pricing is fair. It's not horribly expensive, a great price range for lunch. The decor is very nice, and the service is good. Overall, a 3/5 which I consider respectable. A few improvements in the flavor department would really boost this place.",

My kafta kabob was somewhat dry, as was the meat pie. But the koozi and mousaka were reportedly good. We recommend the tabouli over the house salad, which is mostly iceberg lettuce. Ask about the entrees that come with dessert, and then order the baklava. Each order of baklava comes with two pieces, good for sharing half or taking it home, as I doubt you'll have room for both after all that good food!

She always gets the maxa platter. Not sure if that is how you spell it but that is how it is spelled on their web page.  I unknowingly enough order something else for variety. Funny thing though because we usually end up sharing. Sharing really means me saying\"hey honey would you like some of mine\"? In which her response is \"I might try it but you can have as much of mine as you want\". That's the answer I was looking for.  On to the food! This last time I visited I tried the \"Fetter Treat\". Which in my experience was lamb on a bed of rice (Not white rice but not sure what kind) with pine nuts. It was very good for what it was, and it came with a small lettuce and tomato salad with a lemon dressing. I really liked it but I think I would have been slightly disappointed had my girlfriend not gotten the maxa platter. On the menu the Fetter Treat says it is cooked with mushrooms and onions and a savory mushroom sauce. I saw very few mushrooms and not a drop of sauce. All in all I would probably get it again. The maxa platter on the other hand was pure heaven. I could gorge myself on the Tabooli and Baba Ganooj. The Baba Ganooj had a great smoky flavor and I was really impressed at how fresh everything tasted. With the maxa platter it also has an Artichoke Salad which is really just Artichokes covered in some delicious sauce. Also, huge portions of feta cheese, hummus and tomatoes and olives in the middle.The maxa platter is all cold dishes which is also why I got something hot.  Everything was really good and we enjoyed our dinner very much so.",

It's the cheapest GOOD food in Pittsburgh.  But it's not all about the price.  The food is simple but authentic and delicious.   When my wife have dinner there -- about twice a month -- we usually order another three or four things to take home for the next day.  The service?  You ALWAYS feel welcome.  The wait staff are rushed at times, but friendly.  And \"slow\" is a relative term.  This ain't a fast food restaurant.  Relax, enjoy an appetizer and talk with your meal partner.    And bring a bottle of wine.",

I've been going to Ali Baba for as long as I can remember (at least 20 years), and amazingly it still has the same decor, so the interior is a bit dated to say the least. That being said, it has never bothered me because I go for the food and the service. Anyways, Ali Baba's has some fantastic food, they also have some food that is \"meh\". But what they do well, they do better than anyone else and that is why I keep coming back. The baba ghanooj is still the best I have ever had;  it has lots of tahini and lemon (which really make the dish), the meat grape leaves, tabooli are also great (the tabooli is very citrusy ; the sleek is pretty good  too (a little bland but the caramalzed onions on it are great). I usually stick with the A La Carte menu so I can speak to the \"main courses\" but this place is always a good choice.",

I usually fill up on all of those things so never have actually tried an entree. But the tossed salad compliments the pita and hummus well, seasoned and dressed with fresh lemon juice and olive oil. I've never had to wait long on a table and the service is always prompt. The bf fills up on various chicken dishes, and he is always satisfied. A few times the bread has been dry (I love when its warm and soft) but the hummus is soo good it really doesn't bother me!",

The dinner menu includes around 10 entrees and 15 \"a la carte\" items.  Everything I sampled of my friends was very tasty, well seasoned and very satisfying.  The hummus, baba ghanooj, salads and soups were all obviously made in house, not too garlicky but had a good punch of acidity that I often miss in this type of fare.  If I was closer to Oakland I would frequent this place for lunch.  I feel like it is similar in quality to Istanbul for lunch, but crushes Istanbul's Larryville location for dinner, without question.  Beer only, Wine is BYOB without a corkage from what I could tell.  Lastly, @ Jenny.  I also had the Moussaka.  It was very tasty, and if you think something like this (or lasagna, souffle, etc) is not going to be reheated from a big platter they made earlier that day... you're fooling yourself.",

We got hummus (lots of paprika and fennel, little oil), vegetarian grape leaves (standard, but always a fav), Fatoosh, spinach lentil soup, spinach pie (amazing), the fish entree, and a chicken entree. I didn't try either of the meat dishes, but everyone was really happy with what they got. All of this, six beers (they have no wine or liquor, you're welcome to bring your own bottle), and two desserts was $68. Total steal!   The desserts were pretty amazing too. We got baklava, it wasn't too sweet, too nutty, or too sticky. A really nice balance between filling and phyllo dough. I don't remember the name of the other dessert, it was farina wrapped cheese with crushed pistachio and rose-something syrup. The cheese was the most mild I've ever had, and the syrup really stood out, flowery, but not too sweet.   And for being a hole-in-the-wall kind of place, the service is good - attentive and nice, no dropping your check with the food or taking your order and then forgetting about you.",

As a note, their website menu prices have been raised by about 50 cents an item, but they're still rather reasonable. I also appreciated that they gave us a whole bag of pita bread to take home.  I whole-heartedly recommend the baba ghanoush and muhammara. They have a chunky texture that makes you wonder if some grandma was pummeling walnuts in the back with a mortar and pestle. I'm looking forward to going back and trying more of their dishes.  The atmosphere inside the restaurant looked modern and a nice spot for a romantic dinner.  Overall, Ali Baba is going to become a regular for take-out night at my house. I'd recommend picking up a couple large containers of their dips for your next party.",

The salad is great (no surprise there, I'll eat anything with that lemony Middle Eastern dressing) and the kabobs and hummus are pretty good, but beware of the baba ghanouj...sometimes it can be very bitter if they make a bad batch.

Ended up with pita, hummus, rice that I would call pilaf but I'm not sure if that's technically correct, and a side salad.  The pita wasn't great, but the hummus was delicious--heavy on the tahini and a nice lemon and garlic zing.  The portion was huge and cost me something like $6--and I didn't finish it (don't worry, my lunch companion did).  While our server was wonderful when he stopped by, he was not particularly attentive, to the point where I refilled my own water glass from my water bottle 3 times (albeit, they are really tiny water glasses).
