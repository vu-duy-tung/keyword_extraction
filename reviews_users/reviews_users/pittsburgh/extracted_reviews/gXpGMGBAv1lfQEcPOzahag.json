Their food was solid (I had been craving for tabbouleh and they nailed it), their price was reasonable, and their portion was pretty big. In fact, I had to take half of it home and eat it for dinner. The people behind the counter were very friendly as well. If they offered warm pita and added a tad more spices on their shawarma, they'd easily get 5 stars from me, but this is still a solid 4-4.5-star joint. Will visit again when in downtown.",

Their falafel is airy and nuanced, chicken shawarma is savory and well portioned and the kicker for me is the baba ghanoush - never too oily and always perfectly seasoned.   The people are friendly and will readily exchange light and witty banter or assist a new customer in the finer points of the menu. Palmyra is the perfect casual Mediterranean/Middle Eastern dining experience you can't really match anywhere else in the city. Especially for the price.  P.S. Very robust vegetarian options!",

I would LOVE to see the owners of Madonna's team up with the Vegan Pittsburgh organization to get \"Vegan Friendly\" certified and label their vegan menu items. That's the one thing that Aladdin's has that Madonna's doesn't, and it's the only reason I choose Aladdin's more often. I love being able to look at the menu and quickly identify which options I have. Madonna's could do this easily!",

The shawarma was dressed a bit differently that what i am accustomed to - had pickles and not the typical sauce and spices but it was good. The baba was good - had large chunks of eggplant and i prefer it a bit more smooth. Bottom line they make everything in here and that makes it worth the trip.",

I'm used to the chicken being cooked after I order it. This had been sitting out. It was less dry than I expected given that it'd been sitting out, but it wasn't good.

I cannot recommend this place enough. Besides their food being incredible, the family is just so sweet and absolutely lovely.

They were out of the chicken shwarma (their star-dish from the pictures) when I got there as they were cleaning up after the lunch rush so I had to try something else.   I had the beef sishkabob and there were no regrets! It was very tasty. Could be a little more tender but that's nit-picky-ness as everything was very good.  The rice was fluffy and well cooked. The potatos where tender and perfectly seasoned. The star of the show ends up being their garlic tzatziki sauce, though. Amazingly balanced, it went well with everything.  These guys know their greek food and they're doing it right!",

I got the three hot veggies - lima beans, green beans and greens and beans.  All are amazing.  I also got the veggie grape leaves and the baba.  The baba might be my favorite - nice hunks of eggplant and a ton of flavor.  The people that work there are a delight and if you aren't smiling when you leave, you have done something wrong.

It was all delicious! The chicken was seasoned well and not dry, which was a concern of mine as I saw it turning on the vertical rotisserie.   The Loubieh was a great take on green beans and hopefully one that's easy to recreate, cause I'm going to give it a shot. And to top it off, I got the chicken and two  sides for just $8, such a steal! I will definitely be going back to try more.",

I've walk into this place a number of times and then walked out simply because I had no idea what any of the stuff behind the cafeteria style line was. But today I decided it was time to step outside my norm and throw my culinary caution to the wind. I'm glad I did.  Like James R. pointed out in his \"tip\", I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The lady on the serving line explained what each item was and told me that the lunch special consisted of \"one meat and two sides\".  I went with the kaftans for my meat choice (sort of a lamb and beef mini meatloaf) and for my two side dishes I choose the loubieh (green beans and onion in an oil, garlic, and herb dressing) and sleek (a collard greens and chick pea's dish).  It also came with a zip-lock baggy containing a couple of pita slices. Everything was delicious and I'm sure I'll be back again to try some of their other offerings.   Madonna's isn't exactly a plush or cozy place. The seating is more like what you would find in a fast food restaurant. But the service is quick and the food is good. I challenge you to step outside your culinary comfort zone during your next lunch break and discover something more than burgers and pizza.",

Have gotten the kofta entree, the mix of two meats entree with shish kabobs and schwarma, and the schwarma entree by itself .   It's all delicious.

A small side of rice pilaf and extra house salad accompany the main attraction being the Shwarma. It is prepared on a large skewer similar to one that cooks lamb meat for gyros. Always delicious and never dried out or over cooked. And the garlic sauce that accompanies the meal is amazing!

I finally gave it a try, ordering chicken shawarma, along with falafel and rice pilaf. It was very good. The garlic sauce was a standout. I tried it again, trying new sides. I learned to love the tabbouli, as well as the mujaddara. I have graduated to ordering the veggie platter, ordering some of the former as well as their sleek and potatoes. Everything is well made. The only knock I would give them is the price. They raised their prices in June 2019 and a good order will set you back at least $10. Before, it was a steal. Now it is a healthy downtown option for an acceptable price. Even if you are not familiar with their options, it is worth a shot. You might, like me, find favorites that you would never before considered. Yes, the line can be long, but it moves fast. Check them out.",

Everyone was very pleasant and my lunch was good.  I got the chicken shawarma with hummus and tabouli.

The lady taking my order said that i didnt have to choose salad-- i could get any 2 sides. I went with loubieh (green beans, tomatoes, onions, olive oil) & rice e/ lentils (i forget the official name) Bobby and I decided to split the entree since he had a large breakfast. Also, the owner gave us extra pita after finding out we were splitting the entree.   The food was delicious. Even after splitting it, we both became full quick (how often does that happen for lunch under $10?).",

However, when my husband told me that one of his coworkers comes here for lunch every single day, I figured it has to be good, right?  I went in for lunch with a friend and we each got the Chicken Shawarma. It came with two sides so I got the Tabbouli and Loubieh (green beans). For under $10, the portions were huge; I had enough for lunch and dinner. I was a little nervous the chicken would be dry but it was quite the opposite. I opted to get the sauce on the side and the chicken on its own was delicious and flavorful. Although the sauce does add a nice creamy garlic flavor. The sides tasted very fresh, particularly the Tabbouli. The green beans were full of flavor and were also a very nice addition to the meal.   There are plenty of options for sides so you can make many different combinations. The owners and workers are very nice and welcoming as well. Overall, great place for a quick lunch. Most of the options are pretty healthy too. I will definitely be back when my next craving for Mediterranean strikes.",

Delicious! Everything was fresh and tasted wonderful. I often judge Mediterranean places by their tabouli because if it's not fresh and bright green, you know it's old and then I'm suspicious of the rest of it. Madonna's was terrific! I took all of this home for a filling dinner, and the price was reasonable.  I use a wheelchair and I have a personal gripe about places that expect me to eat a meal but don't provide rest room facilities usable by everyone. When I walked in I immediately asked a man who appeared to be the owner if they had an accessible rest room. He politely ushered me into the back, stopping to move a couple items that might have blocked my path. The rest room was roomy and fine. I told him I had just stopped in two other nearby restaurants and when I saw that they didn't have handicapped bathrooms I left without ordering. This place is friendly and accommodating and I'll look forward to going back whenever I go downtown.",

I chose hummus, falafels, a spicy bean dish, a black pea and green veggie dish, and some spicy green beans (sorry, I don't remember the names of the latter 3).  Came with a sandwich bag of pita bread (3/4 of a whole pita).  Veggie platter is $9.99.    What's Hot - Quality of food.  I love that some of the dishes are spicy!  Their food is lightly spicy- just a slight kick and not overpowering.  The hummus was nicely flavored and not overpowering.  It tasted like the other veggie dishes were freshly made, as well.  Well seasoned and not too salty. - Menu variety.  They have meat and veggies, which is awesome.  Everything looks freshly made.  I saw their shwarma meat roasting when I came and my friend said the meat is made fresh everyday.  I saw tabouli, hummus, grape leaves, and a variety of other veggie and meat dishes.  There appears to be something for everyone, which is definitely helpful.  - It looks like they give you pita bread regardless of what you order, which is nice.  I didn't ask if it automatically comes with your meal, but we didn't get charged for it.   - Service.  My friend has been coming here for years and he says it's family run.  Their staff are nice and helpful and they seem to know some of the other customers, which is sweet. - Good layout.  This place appears popular with the locals.  However, it looks like their space is accommodating.  They have a downstairs seating area, which I didn't check out, but it's nice that they have it.   - Price.  For 5 veggie dishes, $9.99 is a pretty reasonable price.  I didn't see much on their menu that was over $10, which is pretty cool. - Portions.  Leaves you full not stuffed.    - Whatever you order is automatically put in a styrofoam takeaway container, regardless of whether you dine in or take away.  Therefore, if you aren't able to finish your food, you can automatically take it with you.  What's Not - Don't recommend coming with a group of more than 4 people.  Their tables don't accommodate more than 4 people, which means you're pushing together tables if you have more in your group. - Quality of food.  The falafels  were kinda dry, but they didn't come with a sauce, so I dipped them in the hummus.  Final Answer Would definitely come back.",

I also got a side of hummus. Only downfall was that she asked if I wanted garlic sauce, and I said yes, but no one put it on. The hummus was a little different than I'm used to and I wasn't a huge fan but that could just be my taste buds not liking it in particular. They had so many options though so I'll definitely be back and try the kafta next time!",

I followed my coworker's lead and ordered chicken shawarma,  with veggies and hummus on the side.    First of all, I probably received 2 pounds of food!  Secondly, it was amazing.  The chicken was so tasty and garlicky with the sauce on it.  Veggies tasted fresh and seasoned well.  And the hummus was creamy and so good.  As for the price, it's honestly not bad considering the downtown location.    The service was so good.  The ladies who were filling orders were patient and nice, and the gentleman taking payments was funny and personable.   I will for sure be back here again!!",

It's hard to find good quality of food at a decent price, this place surpasses any other restaurant downtown. It's cafeteria style which is a huge plus when the line is out the door; it makes the wait much less painful. There's seating inside should you chose to eat in. I've only ever got the chicken shawarma, tabbouleh, and hummus which were all exceptional. The flavor of each exceeded my expectations. Getting food to go is typically not as good but I stand corrected with this place. Highly recommend for the best Mediterranean cuisine you'll ever encounter.   Shout out to the owners and employees for being so kind and patient when dealing with customers asking questions.   I just had this yesterday for lunch, might just get it again after talking about it I'm salivating just thinking about it.",

The chicken shawarma is always hot off the rotisserie and topped with this amazing house-made garlic sauce.

My buddy has been preaching to me about how this is the go-to place for lunch and I should check it out, so we finally did. I would not say I'm the biggest Mediterranean food fan, but Madonna's will change your mind!  We decided to stop in one Friday early afternoon. It was a nice size lunch rush of a line but you wouldn't believe how quickly it moves because of the cafeteria style setup. When I placed my order, since I wasn't very familiar with the mediterranean names or how to pronounce those names, the young lady who was waiting on me was patient and polite as I pointed at what I wanted. I went with the mixed grill option. The mixed grill was a great option for me because you get two sides, and two proteins. As well as the option to get mixed veggies, hummus and bread.   I went with the green beans, baked potato wedges, and for my proteins, I got the beef and chicken shawarma. All that for $10, unreal. It is difficult for me to express how  delicious this food was. I mean you can tell how fresh the food is and how quality the ingredients are. I have visited twice now and each time the gentlemen has noticed something about me, my hat or design on a tee shirt, and he has made laugh and I appreciate that from a family owned business.   Visit Madonnas downtown one day for lunch and you'll find yourself going back week after week!",

It's so good I just can't bring myself to branch out! They have a house made garlic sauce that is to die for, so don't forget to add that to your shawarma (or anything, really). Additionally, all meals are served with a side of pita bread. Most meals come out to be around or under $10.  Madonna's is the perfect spot for a quick and relatively healthy lunch while in town.",

The star of the show for me was the tabouli, prepared just the way that I like it, fresh with minimal onions, lots of chopped, ripe tomatoes, and just the right amount of lemon and olive oil.

The portions were generous and they let me create my own platter, because I didn't order straight off the menu.  Didn't get the chicken but will try it next time.  Grape leaves looked amazing.  The sleek and the beans were delicious, and so were the green beans.  The hummus was not my favorite type of hummus, I prefer more lemony - stronger favor, but it was still good.  Garlic sauce was great, too!",

My sister got chicken shawarma which was excellent. The garlic sauce is amazing so make sure to ask for some on the side - good for fry dipping. Everything is fresh. So if you want some authentic, homemade middle eastern cuisine be sure to Check this place out.",
