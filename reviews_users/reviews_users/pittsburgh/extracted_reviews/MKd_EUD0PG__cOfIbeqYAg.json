We ordered 2 biscotti, a medium coffee and a pot of tea (which comes with a free refill) and it cost just over $7. The Barista was really nice and helpful.",

    "text": "I have trouble ordering tea when I'm out because it's such a simple thing to make. I know there are a lot of nuances to the preparation, like everything else, that can give you a plethora of subtle variation that you wouldn't get if it was made incorrectly. However, I still can't stand paying for it.  However, Te Cafe has a great selection of gourmet teas that make the stop worth it. It's the kind of stuff that, unless you were a tea connoisseur, you would never be tasting. Their menu is full of teas all with names that vary from mundane, to Japanese, to just plain odd. I've been to the Te Cafe a few times but last night I ordered the \"Kokeicha\". It's a kind of smokey green tea that you steep for 3 minutes. I tried to order a tea by the name of \"gunpowder\" but they were sadly out of it. The man behind the counter informed me that the \"Kokeicha\" was very similar.  The tea was great and, honestly, even when something's not your cup of tea you have a fun experience. It's something you usually don't get to try on your own. Who would honestly buy 23 dollars worth of loose leaf tea that they've never tried? I'll leave it to the Te Cafe to let me sample them a pot at a time.  Every time I enter the cafe the staff are friendly, accommodating, and most of all informative. They know their way around tea so someone who is completely ignorant, as I am, can get a little guidance. It's a fun place to relax and enjoy a beverage you usually wouldn't; how often do you drink gunpowder at home?",

Like the name suggests Te Cafe is known for its tea. The problem is I know little about tea and usually just order lemonade (which comes in different flavors and is really good) or chai. But it seems as if you are a tea lover you'd love this place cause there is hundreds you can order from.   The staff is nice and seem helpful for those asking questions about the tea.  The negative aspect of this place is that sometimes some of the patrons use Te Cafe's small space as their platform to loudly talk about their political and social hot-botton issues. Seriously dude, i'm hear to read, not listen to your rant.  If I was a tea lover im sure I'd give this place 4 to 5 stars, but i'm not so 3 it is, but a very strong 3.",

The overall ambiance is very conducive to being productive: comfortable chairs, good lighting, a great selection of music at the appropriate volume, and of course the warm tasty beverages that are an absolute steal.  This place has the most robust hot chocolate lineup I have ever seen, with the Mexican chocolate being my favorite.  Free wi-fi, with no necessary password, makes things all the more convenient.  I also love how this place caters to those who want to study/read.  Sure light conversation does occur, but I hope it stays that way such not to detract from the great study vibe this place engenders.",

    "text": "Amazing place to read or just relax, lots of loose leaf teas to choose from. Some of their lower priced teas aren't thrilling (especially the greens) but you get what you pay for.   The only problem I see arising is, if you buy a pot which is the best deal, you get a neat tray that comes with a timer, a cup for drinking, and a cup to hold the used leaves. If you're drinking on your own or with a single friend, that's fine and dandy- but it's near impossible to have a proper meeting with three or more people without forcing everyone to use inefficient mugs instead. I might be mistaken but they really should have party tray type tea sets.   Still, 5 stars for sure. Excellent service, eclectic music (classical one day, indie the next), good ambiance, good price, decent hours (I wish they would open a bit earlier, but they close so late that it makes up for it), and some really amazing teas mixed in. Free wifi makes it even better.",

I have yet to find a better place to get good, loose leaf tea. The presentation is top notch and the variety is excellent.  The atmosphere of this little tea shop cannot be described. I would stop by towards the end of the day to finish up some work. The relaxed setting and fairly quiet place made it easy to focus and get things done.  I don't work in the area anymore, but I'll use any excuse to get back there.  Seriously, it is worth fighting to find a parking spot in Squirrel Hill for this place.",

It's a very chilled out place, got big windows and all kinds of seating. It's not the fanciest cafe around, which is actually nice, because it has a very comfortable vibe to it. They have free and unlimited wifi. The ambience is great for doing your own thing, but I've also played board games there.  They have all kinds of teas there. They have specials every day in each variety, and they give you a pot of it, which is around 2-3 cups. You can also order a pot of any loose leaf tea on the menu. Or, you can buy loose leaf tea as well. My all-time favorite is the Panetonne. It's a black tea with vanilla and orange, and just the right amount of it too. I also really like their Green Tea smoothie, they make it with Maccha powder. They make grilled cheese sandwiches and have some biscottis and muffins.  Great place, check it out!",

Coffeehouses in Pittsburgh often were too loud and rickety uncomfortable chairs.  The owners are often attentive and bring a certain unique warmth to the place.  Sure, a large part of the cafe is devoted to them.  I loved coming here for an after-dinner conversation with a friend or for studying.  Normally I would order a pot of darjeeling or a green tea.  Great selection of teas.  Very attentive service.  They give you a timer to help you remember how long to steep the tea.  The cups are all selected for the particular type of tea being served.  When I was in the area, the cafe closed on Saturdays (being in Squirrel Hill), but I hear the hours may have changed.  Also, the owners seemed to have hired some of the younger crowd in the last few months which changed the pace somewhat.  Still, when I visit Pittsburgh, I will return to this place.",

But this is a neat little place in Squirrel Hill and it's one of the reasons why I love living in this neighborhood so much.  There are so many individual stores and cafes that make it so preferable to \"Strip Mall Suburbia\".  This is a tea house and not a coffee house.  So don't go looking for ye olde cup of Joe here.  They have many varities of teas here:  blacks, reds, herbals, whites, greens.  They might seem a little pricey here, but they do serve you a 16oz pot here.  And they have all kinds of sandwiches and baked goods here including a cashew butter and jelly sandwich (which I didn't try) and a Southwestern Wrap, which was very good.  If you are looking for gifts for the tea drinker in your life, they have all sorts of gifts available.  They also have Kosher teas too.",

Hmmm, maybe I didn't write the review because subconsciously I wanted to keep this little gem all to myself.   They have an extended selection of teas though I usually just go for the easy option: the tea of the day. I've gotten their yerba mate every once in a while and I like that they tell you to properly time it at 5 minutes. Nowadays they make smoothies too though I personally haven't tried them (it's nice and quiet without the constant blender buzz). For snacks you can go with the grilled cheese sandwiches or some of the regular coffe shop sweets. Sometimes I complain about the lack of options in the snack department but I have to admit it seems wise to keep the food choices simple, after all you have more than 50 teas to chose from.  If you're looking for a mellow place to work (with comfy chairs) and few people mostly working at their computers or reading their ipads this is the place for you.   Side warning:  I love the comfy chair and I'll give you mean stares if you happen to occupy it :)",

Their lavender lemonade is great as is their plum berry white tea. I wish they had more room. The one thing they can definitely improve upon is their bathroom. The toilet is almost always broken and it never seems too clean.",

    "text": "Even if you're not in the mood for something from Te Cafe's diverse tea selection, there are plenty of other drinks that satisfy: tea lattes, lemonades (both plain and with unusual flavors like ginger, lemonade and hibiscus), hot chocolates and more.  The pleasant staff is knowledgeable about its teas and can offer great recommendations.  The loose leaf tea is also sold, and some of the more unusual tea blends can make neat gifts for people.  The atmosphere is calm enough that I can concentrate if I bring work to do.  It's also really helpful that in terms of food, Te Cafe offers more than sweets--while I loved baked goods, sometimes I need something more than sugar to fuel my noggin.  Grilled cheese sandwiches and vegetable soup are recent additions to the cafe's menu.  While the soup is clearly from the can, it and the grilled cheese are nourishing.  I definitely appreciate not having to pack up all my study materials and leave in search of a decent meal.    I really like the feeling of community that Te Cafe fosters with an area for posters and fliers for upcoming local events and work by local artists on the walls.  The cafe also hosts occasional poetry readings, but unfortunately I've never been able to attend one.",

They have an amazing tea collection, with equally good food and even grilled cheese sandwiches (with the option to add tomato :) )  One of the walls has some cute benches that are padded, making it a perfect place to wrap your hands around your warm cup of tea and read a book.  I agree with Rachel C, I wish they had high tea, that would make it perfect!  The only drawback is that it's small, and there aren't a lot of places to sit.

I have been lucky enough to have a long time boyfriend who will order a pot that is a different tea than what I choose so that we can try as many flavors as possible.  Recommending the pomegranate rose-hips tea. It's a tea I used to get when I lived in the city and biked to squirrel hill. -okay, so I did that once. I couldn't hack the hill of Forbes- it was still refreshing.  Five stars for their biscottis also! So many people tend to be drawn in for the grilled cheese, but if you ask me it's the biscottis that should really be talked about. They're large, with great texture and a huge variety of flavors.  Lastly I love the ambiance of Te Cafe.  It's decorated nicely with art for purchase on the walls. A generally relaxing atmosphere is also complimented with a game of chess.  They have a really nice chess set with nice carved pieces.",

They have a large and varied list of teas in every kind of flavor and kind (herbal, black, floral, oolong, red, etc.).  All their teas are loose leaf and you can buy it by the cup or the pot.  Um, of course, I had to get it by the pot!    They give you a tray full of the goods.  A pot with the loose leaf tea of your choosing, a little cup to dispose of your leaves, a mug (of course for the tea) and a hour glass timer for you to time out if you want it light, medium or bold.  I mean, how cute is that?  I almost thought the Mad Hatter was going to appear and we would toast to Alice!    I tried the Pumpkin Blend and it was delectably fall!  I love black teas because, as I am of English heritage, I must have milk in my tea.  It blended beautifully together.  I actually want to come in every day and try every single kind of black tea!    They also offer other kinds of specialty drinks, like hot mulled caramel apple cider and Mexican hot chocolate.  Honestly, everything sounded delicious!  How could I ever stray from tea?  But with the look of the other drinks, I probably could once at least, for the sake of being fair!    The ambiance is totally chill, lots of people on lap tops.  They have old books for you to read.  Tables for groups or your computer and comfy chairs to sit and chat with a friend.    For realz, I've come home!  Tell the Mad Hatter I'll be there tomorrow!",

They offer teas by the pot only, except for iced teas (during warm months) which come by the cup.  They range from $3 to $4 per pot depending on how fancy the tea is.  The staff here has been friendly every time I've been.  They are always keen on offering suggestions if you ask!  Last time, I was struggling between going for a fruity tea vs. a chocolatey tea, and the girl working suggested this chocolate peppermint tea blend that was not on the menu but that she had made for herself the other day.  I tried it, and it was AMAZING!  My experiences with the food here (from at least a year ago) have been great as well.  They have their own pastries as well as a selection from a nearby bakery.  Savory offerings include grilled cheeses, soups, and sometimes specials.  One small gripe I have is that their teapots tend to, for whatever reason or another, leak some tea leaves and residue when you pour into your cup.  I suspect it's because the filter is not super fine and so small bits from the tea mixture can fall through.  It's never been a major problem, though.  You can always find fun, seasonal specialty drinks here too (e.g. hot apple cider in the fall), in addition to coffee, if tea isn't your thing.  Newspapers and reading materials are usually available to pick up, and there are board games in the back.  This is a great place for a rainy (or cold) day!",

I spent many hours here working on my thesis, but also many hours here just hanging out with friends or reading a book. The people who work there are very friendly and very patient. When I first started stopping in, I knew very little about tea, and they always took the time to explain different properties of each type of tea and were able to make thoughtful suggestions for things they thought I should try based on my current mood and goals for the day.  One of the best parts of this place is the insane selection they have. I felt like there was always something new to try. I loved the hot cider in the winter.  The space was almost always neat and clean, including the bathroom. I enjoyed the little flowers they kept on the tables, and the music selection was what you would hope for in a cozy little tea shop. The atmosphere is inviting, and only rarely would it be too crowded to find a place to sit. The wi-fi was much more reliable than other places in the area.  I love this place! If I ever make it back to Pittsburgh, I'm going to make it a point to stop in. Keep up the great work!",

You get a lot for $8-$9, and it tastes yummy. Would recommend.   The mulled tea is my favorite though. I'll miss it in the summer.",

Pros: -Barista was extremely attentive and suggested us drinks -I got the black tea (apricot) and it was delicious! -Free refils on water, although my pot had already brewed 3-4 glasses of tea -Interesting collection of books and board games to be engaged with.  Cons: -Lots of items on their menu wasn't available. (the woman said that the owner hadn't refilled the tea leaves) -Less extensive tea menu as compared to Dobra -Place seems a bit run down, and lacks maintenance. Even the tea pot seemed kind of old and was chipped at the spout.   Overall, this place seems much quieter compared to the other cafes in the other area. If you want to come sit and work for a few hours or study, this is the spot!",

Cups of tea were around $2, and I got a pot of peaches and cream tea for $4.01 with tax.  The Cream Earl Grey is amazing as well!  There is also free hot water so you can keep going!  - If you are not a hot tea drinker, there is also iced tea, lemonade, and hot chocolate!  -They sell grilled cheese sandwiches with pesto for $4.50 ish.  I don't remember the exact price, but I remember that the pesto grilled cheese was amazing.  -This place gets packed with wifi hogs.  You've been warned.  I really like the vibe of this place.  It's a good place to catch up with a friend or study, and I like that it's on the quiet side of things.  They usually are out of most of the teas on the menu, but there are still at least 50 types.  I will definitely be returning here soon!",

There are so many different kinds of teas and I appreciate the variety they offer in terms of food + ambiance + teas.   I would give this place 5 stars but I am not a fan of their bubble tea. They microwaved the boba (they pre-make it and then put it in the fridge) and the flavor didn't even taste like tea. It was $4 and I don't feel like it was worth it. I was hoping it would be better since they do specialize in tea but I do realize that doesn't necessarily mean their bubble tea would be good since in my opinion that is a whole different category.  I would come back strictly for their hot teas but definitely not the bubble tea.",

I really wanted to enjoy this place because the inside is very cute and cozy, but as far as the quality and the taste of what they serve it isn't worth visiting. The inside is decorated with lots of bar stools and comfy chairs. They have free WiFi which is pretty fast too.  I've ordered both sushi rolls and milk tea from here; all occasions weren't good.  I ordered a simple black milk tea, tasted like bland chocolate milk with strange flavored pearls. They skimp on the pearls as well but in this case I wasn't complaining.  They charge almost four bucks for this drink but wasn't worth more than two as it wasn't very enjoyable.  I've had the eel roll and another one I can't recall; again not good. The eel was served as those thick cut pre frozen cuts. The kind where you swallow it and it just itches your throat with how over processed it is. It wasn't fresh by any means. The only thing I liked were sadly the freshness of the cucumber inside that roll, basically I payed 10 bucks for an eel roll to enjoy only the veggies in it as the eel made me gag so I had to take it out of each slice.  They took over twenty mins to make a roll for me to go. I can't recommend any outstanding tea places but this one isn't it. Hopefully this gave some insight, spend your money wisely!",

The sushi rolls were good and priced well for sushi. They were a good size too, which meant I ate just the right amount of food for lunch by ordering one roll with a seaweed salad.  The best part for me was by far the service. Very friendly throughout my whole experience. As my friend and I were leaving, the people behind the counter even asked us if needed anything else.

    "text": "I dropped by Te Cafe a week ago with CM to check out their offerings. As a tea lover, having passed it many times on Murray, I'd long been curious about it. My friends who live nearby never wanted to go, however, since they prefer Dobra Tea across the street. Last week, CM wanted to get a hot beverage in the area, and he was game for checking it out, so I was able to do so.  When we went to order, the menu had loose leaf teas listed by type (columns) and by grade (rows), which determined their price.  While you can buy them by the cup, if you're with other people or you're planning on hanging out for awhile, it usually makes more sense to get a pot, since each pot provides 2-3 infusions, and hot water is free.  We decided on a pot of the milk (?) oolong ($4.50), recommended by the barista, which was on the lighter side and was quite pleasant.  Once we'd had a pot and refilled it with hot water for a second infusion, we also got a pesto grilled cheese sandwich with tomato as a snack ($4.75), which was crisp and super-flavorful (thanks for the recommendation, fellow Yelpers!), and complemented the tea well.  My favorite part of Te Cafe, however, was the board games that can be found on the back shelf and front table.  Unfortunately, not all of them are complete, as CM and I found out when we picked up the Ultimate Scenario Game (?), but those that are make for a fun time!  We ended up playing dominoes--which I'd never played with as a game before (just setting them up in rows and knocking them down ;-) ). Since the first two games went quickly, with each of us winning one, we played best out of three. The last game went on to the point I thought we were going to run out of dominoes, but I eventually won.  Yay!  While I understand my friends' preference for Dobra, given that they have a more extensive menu of tea and snacks and a more unique Asian tea house-like atmosphere, I enjoyed Te Cafe for a change of pace. I'd definitely return for another visit in the future to sample more interesting teas--and to play another round of dominoes!",

There's something magical within the smaller details. The cozy interior. The way the large pane windows steam up in the winter, encasing you from the outside world. Colorful outdoor seating in the warmer months. An assortment of high-level academic texts left by local grad students for your perusal (seriously, I saw an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile A.I. Design textbook once). Or maybe just the most important aspect: a large rotating stock of dozens of high quality teas, and a friendly barista staff who is delighted when asked for suggestions.  Inexpensive. Huge selection. Top Quality. And without any sort of pretension. If you are looking for a tea shop that has a 60pg menu with leaf oxidation guides, this is not the place (however, there is another, more ostentatious tea spot in Squirrel Hill that you can try for that sort of thing). Instead, come to Te Cafe to soothe your soul.",

They have a good amount of space for studying or hanging out (plus some visible outlets) and looked like they had a good selection of drinks and food. Looks like you could also buy tea leaves by the pound.  I ordered the matcha latte with boba, and the matcha itself was a bit watery for my tastes, but overall the drink was fine. The boba itself was a bit disappointing, as the consistency wasn't right - it was too soggy. The cups are also not sealed, so that's a bummer if you're going to be carrying your drink for a while. They did have the foresight to mix the matcha with some warm water first before making the drink, to avoid clumping and an inconsistent or unmixed taste for cold drinks.  All in all, it's a nice cafe and I wouldn't be opposed to coming back to try out the sushi or food options. The tea itself though left a bit to be desired and the staff didn't look very pleased to see me when I walked in, oh well.",

It's usually not too crowded - I've never had a problem finding a seat. The wifi is reliable and there are plenty of power outlets.  The TEA: they have a great tea selection. I personally like black teas, so my favorite is probably the Assam. If you get a pot, you can get as many hot water refills as you want. I find a pot is a little to big for me alone - I can't finish it before it starts getting cold, but it's perfect for 2-3 people. There's no extra charge for sharing. They serve pots on a tray with a timer, so you can tell how long you need to steep the tea for. I also really like their chai latte, and their hot chocolate is AMAZING!  The Food: they make their sushi/bowls here fresh to order. I have liked all the ones I've tried, but I'm not exactly a sushi expert. The roll of the day + tea is a great deal",

I have been there about 5 times in two years and have only managed to get food there once. This is because four out of the five times I have been the man behind the counter simply shrugged and said \"No one here\" or \"sushi chef not here\", this was around 12:30 the first time and 4:00 the next. He did not elaborate beyond that. You would thing that a place with such competition in tea across the street would at least have more people on duty during lunchtime and evening hours. The food I actually managed to get was the twin cities roll, a blend of tuna, salmon, and avocado with cucumber. Overall it was a pretty average roll, and there are many better sushi places close by. Again I wish I could give it a higher rating but only getting your food 20% of the time are odds I would rather skip and go elsewhere.",

The spicy tuna roll was more like a Korean style gimbap with \"spicy\" mayo drizzled over it. While it was ok, it just didn't taste like sushi to me.  As for the coffee the boyfie ordered... HORRIBLE! He took one sip and looked at me with a sour face. I smelled the coffee and it smelled like watered down 2 day old coffee from the 2L pot. So gross. Never again.

Taste was rich and fruity and made me want to go back for another flavor!  My friend got their sashimi bowl and it looked awesome! It made a nice, light lunch for her and the price wasn't outrageous. I see that they have crepes too so will definitely have to drag the hubs here to order all new stuff!  They also have some games in the back but I was happy just chatting with my friend in the laid back atmosphere.   Some other reviewers mentioned this but the smell of this place really wasn't appetizing--must be due to the combo of fish + tea?

Located at the opposite corner of Beacon and Murray Aves from the other tea place I had visited earlier, this place has no particular theme to it.  They serve your tea in paper cups whether you want it cold or hot. The server let me actually sample some of them before deciding. They had an apple cider tea which is a holiday special and it tasted like apple cider. He had a plum and berry tea so when I sampled that I could taste the sweetness. I ordered a cup of that and sat down. I noticed that they offer free WiFi. They are noted for the grilled cheese paninis but they also serve various kinds of sushi. In addition there were dessert offerings as well.  I was very impressed with my tea and definitely wanted to buy some to take home. He normally sells it in bags but I saw a cute Japanese girl tin and asked about how many ounces that would hold. He measured it and told me around 3. I decided to go with that. My 3 ounces came to around $6-$7.00 max and he gave me instructions on how to successfully brew it and how long to leave it in my tea cup to infuse. He wrote it down for me. I thanked him very much and told him I would return.  He showed me plain teapots that had infusers built in them for a reasonable price but since I already have an infuser I didn't really need it. If I had more of an appetite I would have tried the sushi but that will be on my list when I return here. I was extremely pleased that such a plain establishment would let you sample and serve great tea at reasonable prices.",

The staff was super sweet and helpful and suggested some different teas for my friend.  I ended up getting a white tea which was nice.    The cafe has both tables and comfortable side seating (long comfy bench).  I believe they also have a couple of comfy chairs.  In addition to the internet, they have made this a cozy place with games that customers can play with - both for adults and children!  My friend's child ahd the time of his life.    I'll definitely be going back!",

It's sad that I don't come out here more often, now that I live here again...  Anyway, they have a fantastic beverage selection (not just tea), high-quality loose-leaf teas you can buy by the ounce, comfortable enough seating, free wifi, and friendly staff.  The music's a toss-up; right now, it's some pretty good oldish rock, but apparently there is \"wispy Lillith fair crap,\" sometimes?  On the bright side, if you show up on a bad day, it is definitely quiet enough to allow you to just listen to your own on headphones.  And the clientele is pretty varied, which I also rather like.",

Cream Earl Grey is delicious, as well as peppermint rose.",

    "text": "This quaint cafe is located conveniently in the middle of Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood and is the perfect study spot for university students living in the area. As a student at Pitt, I frequently took the 61C, 61D, and 59U to the shop, which all drop you off basically right at the front door.  Also, with an extensive offering of teas, the menu can please just about anyone... I'd often bring non-tea drinking study partners to the shop, and they were always pleased with their first tea experience, or with the variety of other drinks and snacks available (smoothies, hot chocolate, drip coffee, etc.)   Not living as close to the area anymore, I still visit Te Cafe as often as possible and I'm never disappointed, and I particularly enjoy the addition of the creative seasonal creations that the staff add to the menu... their latest concoction: Maple Mate Latte... delicious. This place is definitely worth the visit.",

They have awesome fruit smoothies, made with REAL fruit!  I've gotten them for breakfast a few times, also NYC famous H&H bagels, you cant go wrong grabbing something on the go here.  I get some tea to take home from time to time, there are tons to pick from its hard to choose!  Their daily teas are always changing and are a great way to try something you may not think you would have chosen yourself.  All in all I think Te is great, I don't how they do it but they do it well.",

The tea selection is extremely extensive, and the staff is very knowledgable and willing to help you out if you don't know what you want. This is the kind of place where you can sit at the bar and chat with the baristas, and there will be a regular sitting next to you reading the paper and ordering \"the usual.\" While the tea menu is huge, if you get the teas of the day listed on the board (which are color coded by type: black, green, white, or herbal) you'll get them for a lot cheaper. I recommend hanging out for a while with a pot of a tea of the day, which is only $3 for the pot with 2 hot water refills. I also highly recommend their grilled cheese paninis with tomato, which are overpriced but too good to pass up if you're hungry. The hot chocolates are great specialty drinks in the winter (better than any coffee shop I know) and their specialty lemonades rock in the summer. I've known a handful of the baristas who worked here and all were happy and had fun befriending customers during their shifts, which gives this place one of my favorite cafe atmospheres.",

There are board games available for playing, but most people seem to either be there with one or two other people to chat, or on their laptops making use of the wi-fi. The staff is very knowledgeable about different kinds of tea, and if you need help picking something, will ask you questions to figure something out - green or oolong?  floral or fruity? - and then bring out several teas for you to smell before choosing one.  My favorite so far is the silk oolong, which is a smooth and slightly creamy oolong tea.  I also really like the tea cups they use for Chinese teas.",
