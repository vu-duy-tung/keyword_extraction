The guac was made at our table and was fresh and delicious.  I ordered the shrimp & steak fajitas and the portion was very large and tasty.  If there is one downside to the meal, it was the Mexican rice which was rather plain.  My wife's chicken quesadillas were very good.   The service was good and Valerie, who was our waitress, got us everything we needed.  There were two TVs for the sports fan in the main seating area.  I would definitely recommend this for an affordable Mexican meal.",

    "text": "We've been meaning to come here for the longest time since it first opened. Finally made it this past weekend (Saturday Night). If you are a group of 5 or more - I highly recommend making a reservation. Since they don't accept reservation for group that's smaller than 5, The lady and I along with my sister whose birthday we were celebrating stopped by around 7PM and boy was it packed. The bar was packed and the wait for a table was about 40 minutes but nonetheless we agreed to wait. About 40 minutes later - we were seated.  We were quickly waited by a friendly server along with a complimentary chips and salsa. We got few different items including chicken enchilladas combo, hard taco shell with chicken (with salad and soup), fish tacos, vegetarian quesedilla and the highly recommended guacomole dip. I didn't really care for the Enchilada (which was part of the combo) but the rest were really good. If you didn't know the combo (pick 2) means 2 entree and 2 sides (4 items in total) from the combo menu respectively. However, the size will be smaller than the regular menu items. So, make sure to order accordingly.  For such a packed place, the service was quick and great. Although we were all full, we made sure to get a churro dessert for the birthday girl and along with that came a sombrero hat on her and an outstanding Birthday Wish performance in Spanish by the manager, host along with few other staffs.  Would definitely be back.",

Food was \"vanilla,\" orders had missing sides, and the check was not split correctly.   In terms of food quality, there are other Mexican food places nearby that are FAR superior. The hard shell chicken taco I ordered arrived as beef. Fine, sometimes there are mistakes, and I can understand that. But the beef was similar to taco bell quality and tasted burnt. I will say that the taco was still crunchy so at least it was fresh and hadn't sat out very long.   The mojito I ordered was also generic at best. It arrived in a regular beer glass and had three pieces of mint, too much ice and the flavor was bland. If you're  charging premium prices for cocktails, they ought to be premium quality.   Finally, the table side guacamole is delicious and there is enough for 4. Although a bit of a gimmic, this is the only thing I would order again. Offering something other than chips to go along with it would take this app to the next level.    Overall, this location is cursed, as the previous \"grill\" did not last long and I can't say that I have faith this place will either. If you're looking for cheap beer and apps this is the place to be. If your looking for a quality TexMex entree, head down the street a bit further.",

    "text": "I was so excited to try this restaurant, and I have to say, I was far from impressed by this place! I went with a group on 12 later in the evening on a Saturday night. With the restaurant being new, I have to say, they were quite accommodating and sat us rather quickly. But, after being seated, it took a good 15 minutes or so before we were even brought water. Then, after finally being given water and chips, another 15 minutes or so passed before anyone was asked if they wanted other beverages and/or appetizers. I was starving, hence grouchy, so not incredibly happy at this point. I dug into the chips, which were not bad, but slicked with oil. They were hands down the greasiest tortilla chips that I have ever had. This might be someone's dream come True, but I just don't like greasy food, but, like I said, I was starving, so beggars can't be choosers. The salsa was pretty good, but nothing to write home about.   Finally, after being there for what seemed to be an eternity, our food arrived. I ordered the Tacos Al Pastor, usually one of my favorites because I loooove pork. These were HORRIBLE! There were three tacos in the order, each of which came with two corn tortillas sort of fused together. The doubling up of the tortillas made for a really dry base for the taco. Inside the taco, there was hardly any filling, so I was basically just eating corn tortillas. Not cool. The pork inside was cubed, which was weird. I expected it to be shredded. The cubed pork was slimy on the outside and dry on the inside, and relatively flavorless. It was truly godawful. The only thing that added flavor to these tacos were the slices of pineapple in them, and thank god for those, because otherwise I would have probably gagged. I kept trying to compensate for the lack of flavor/texture of the food by dousing the tacos with the sub-par guacamole that I ordered, but this was hardly to any avail. I was incredibly disappointed with these half-ass tacos. I know plenty other places locally that serve incredible Mexican food, so there is no need for me ever to return to this establishment.   Word to the wise--do not let the cute decor and location fool you--this place sucks! I know it's new and new restaurants always face challenges, but excepting the bad service likely due to the newness of the restaurant, the food just ain't good.",

Our waitress was very good and engaged with him very well. Our food came out quick and we never had to look for her to ask for more refills; she was there frequently at the table. I would highly recommend.",

    "text": "My wife and I decided to go to Totopo Mexican Kitchen for our anniversary and we were not disappointed.  The restaurant had a nice selection of Mexican specialties including tacos, burritos, quesadillas, fajitas, tamale and more.  We were there during happy hour so drinks and appetizers were half off.  We ordered the Choriqueso, a cheese and chorizo dip with roasted poblano peppers, prepared right at the table.  It was delicious.  For dinner, I ordered a grilled steak burrito that was stuffed with steak, cilantro rice, and beans.  On the side was a very nice salad with a spicy balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  My wife ordered a combination that included a chicken and salsa verde tamal and beef enchilada with black beans and cilantro rice on the side.  Both of our meals were excellent.    The ambiance is a modern take on the typical Mexican decor with cleaner lines and less of the kitschy Mexican motifs found in other restaurants.  In addition to a well stocked bar, Totopo has a moderately sized dining room as well as a party room suitable for large groups. Overall, we had an excellent experience at Totopo and would defiantly come back.",

We've not had a single item placed in front of us that we didn't enjoy.  The issue at Totopo is the service.  I think that nearly every time we've visited, we have had to send at least one item back to the kitchen for not being what was ordered (ex: chicken burrito was served instead of the beef burrito that was ordered).  On the one visit that the food order was correct, we were missing an item (a complete kids meal) and had to wait for the server to stop by the table and remind them and then wait for the forgotten meal to be made.  I would have thought that the staff would have found their stride by now, but it appears not.  I'll revisit my review if the service improves.",

We just moved from California, where in every corner there is a Mexican restaurant and I've never been to a place like this. The food in just four words.......out of this world! From the moment you're greeted, to the friendly servers,  to the friendly guacamole maker (table side) to the amazing food, and until you leave, this place is spectacular!  Juan and his wife Danielle, the owners and host, are of the friendliest, most noble people I have ever met. They literally treat you like family. I felt like VIP. The decor of the restaurant is very authentic and has a very nice vibe to it.  The ambient music was awesome  and made me feel like I was in Mexico and made feel like I should start dancing with my wife by the table! I strongly recommend this restaurant.  Try the carne asada, or the choripollo! (Chorizo and chicken, see photos). Also try the empanada appetizer. To die for! This place opened up just about 6 weeks ago. And the place was full. That only tells you one thing.  It's popular and very delicious. This was on a Wednesday night!  Be sure to go for brunch too! They have a while different menu for brunch! So, if you're on the fence to try something new, or if for some reason some negative Nancy left a bad review, don't pay attention to it!  This place and this review is the real deal. GOOOOOO! You won't regret it,  and you'll thank me later. Enjoy!",

Overall, we had a really enjoyable experience and we thought the food was delicious and in a very reasonable price range when comparing it to other establishments.  Our wait time was only 15 minutes to be seated, we were immediately given chips and salsa. As a matter of fact a woman was walking around constantly to make sure each guest table had fresh chips and salsa. The salsa was delicious. The chips and salsa were definitely freshly homemade.  We ordered several margaritas and we thought they were very good. They seemed strong but I don't think they were as strong as other establishments.  We ordered the dip sampler. The queso was fantastic and the chunky salsa and guacamole were very good.  We also ordered the enchilada, burrito and fajita  quesadilla and all were supremely good and tasted very authentic. The portions were not very large though, but priced well.  Overall we thought the food was excellent, the service not bad for being new, and the pricing to be reasonable. We would certainly recommend that you try it out. We're glad to have another new restaurant in our Mt. Lebanon community.",

We were desperate for a good meal, but couldn't seem to fine the right place (with availability). Totopo was packed but there was a table available, so in we went. The chips and salsa are AMAZING, and in another realm from Mad Mex (which I also love). I ordered a fajita, and it did not disappoint. The meat and shrimp were delicious and the toppings fresh and plentiful. The two boys had no complaints either and we left exceptionally full and satisfied. Though we were grateful for the table availability, our specific table was in a not-so-great location, so heads up on that. Some of the tables are packed in a little too tight IMO. Otherwise, Totopo is tops!",

You get a free order of guacamole or queso when you check in on Yelp!  I order a chicken chimichanga at every Mexican restaurant I go to, and Totopo's was definitely one to beat. It was jam packed with shredded chicken and topped with freshly made pico. My friends ordered the fajitas and the skinny burrito, and they both looked fantastic!

I'm also a big fan of their margarita sampler. You get five little margaritas of different flavors, and they're all delicious. Drink them quickly, though, because once they melt they don't quite taste as great.  My favorite menu item is the chicken quesadilla. I'm also a fan of the chicken tacos that are served in lettuce, as opposed to a taco shell.  The rice and beans sides are also served hot and fresh. The only downside is the portions. I usually have leftovers when I visit a Mexican restaurant but tend to eat my entire meal here.",

My only gripe and most would call it petty, the bar is a little too short for long legged people(I'm currently 6'5\"). I wish I could give half stars, because this place is a 4.5 not a 4! The food was amazing! The tacos Al Pastor were DELICIOUS, flavourful, and not over pineappled like most places. Fresh chips and salsa, chips need a bit of salt. Smokey Mezcal was nice and reasonably priced, that was my appetizer! Dessert, which I didn't save room for but I wanted it, was the churro and ice cream!",

    "text": "Went there with friends last week when I was in town and I loved this place! Mexican food is my all time favorite and I normally know what I'm getting when I go (fajitas). However, I was so blown away by the menu at Totopo. There were so many different items to try, jicama chips, chorizo tacos, etc. Things that you may or may not be used to seeing on a traditional menu.   They also had some cool burrito bowl options which I always appreciate since I cannot have flour (gf).   I went with the skinny tacos which were wrapped in lettuce leaves that had mahi and chicken. I really loved the flavor, and although messy (which most lettuce wraps are) I still managed to pick all three up.   We had margaritas, which I loved the agave margarita. We ordered tableside guac - which was fantastic, and all my friends enjoyed their meals as well.   Definitely, a cute spot with a very crowded bar if you are looking for a fun night out,I'dd definitely suggest this!",

After a long shift at work, I wanted to stay local in Mt. Lebanon than worry about downtown parking and Friday night reservations. Free parking is always easy to find on residential streets, and we don't mind a short walk. My husband and I decided on Totopo. I chose a frozen lime margarita. It was delicious-not too sweet and not watered down, served with a slice of lime and salted rim. My husband, always preferring beer over hard liquor, had a Corona, which was served promptly and was ice cold. I ordered the tableside-made guac, which paired perfectly with my drink. I love that the chips aren't too salty. Our bartenders were awesome! Attentive, funny, and great service as usual.",

I am not sure if we had a first timer vibe, it was my ready to pop pregnant belly, or just a really nice manger but he gave us table side made guacamole on the house.  It was delish and fun to watch it be made.   For the gluten free among us it was easy to find options.  The quesadilla was good but the chicken chorizo tacos were unbelievable! One person tried the margarita and said it was wonderful!  I am excited to go back after baby and try one.  Weekdays 4-6 the are half off!  So are appetizers and beer is a dollar off.   The service was good.  Some of the servers were hard to hear as the talked quietly.  They were on top of checking on us as refilled waters frequently.  The environment was friendly, and inviting.  We'll care for live plants made the place feel homey and natural.  As far as we could see it was spotlessly clean.  I wish I checked the bathroom but as we live around the corner it did not occur to any of us to scope it out.",

    "text": "Now given that this restaurant just opened June 1st of this year, I think they are doing an amazing job! One thing is for sure, that this place is a stand out on Washington rd from the rest. The atmosphere is relaxing, festive, modern, and they have plenty of seating. However, after 5pm they get busy and is usually a wait.     Today we arrived at 5pm and were sat immediately. They sat us in a booth where we were able to look at the restaurant and bar. Our server, Enrique, was very nice. He was able to guide us through their menu, as it was a tad overwhelming. The drink menu was extensive. And being that we were there before 6pm we were still able to enjoy happy hour, that included $1 off drafts and half off margaritas!     Tonight I ordered a cup of corn soup. That was delish! If you light creamy corn you would defined enjoy this soup! Add some hot sauce and it's awesome! The choriqueso is an app. It is a cheese fondue made at the table with peppers and beef. This was very good as well! We also had the chicken fajitas. The fajitas portion was huge and can defined be shared! Just ask for extra flour tortillas. For desert I ordered the fried ice cream. This was also very big in portion! It was the Mexican way fried ice cream. With the vanilla ice cream rolled in a cornflake, put in a fried looking desert tortilla and topped with a mountain of whipped topping. Very yum!    Overall, a win. Very happy with this place. They have outdoor seating, a back dining room, a bar to sit at while you wait for a table, great and friendly servers and hosts. Thumbs up! Not a thing negative to say this visit!",

My Fiance and I finally checked Totopo out the other day, and the only regret I have is not going sooner. We went on a Friday night around 6. It looked semi busy when we got there; we were told a 25 min wait but it was only about 10 min! (Btw when we left at around 8-830, place was bumping!)  Chips and salsa are great, they sort of remind me of Emiliano's. The house margs are two thumbs up, delish! I ordered the tacos al pastor, fiance ordered a chorizo burrito. Both were SO GOOD!!! We didn't get dessert but the menu seemed pretty basic for Mexican (fried ice cream, churros, etc.). They have a good selection of beers and mixed drinks, with reasonable prices! Oh, they even have daily specials. Wednesday was a wine marg deal for $5, gonna be hard not to hit that up every Wednesday.   One thing I want to make sure to touch on is the service. I know I've only been there once, but it's a new place and I was impressed with or service we had. From the host, to the bartenders, to our waitress, great service! I read some reviews before stopping in that talked about bad service, my tip is to give them a chance to get used to doing business and try it again!",

    "text": "I was meeting my friends for dinner and we wanted to try this restaurant because it was new. I LOVE Mexican food. In fact this was my 3rd time this week for having Mexican food for dinner. I was psyched to try it.  When we got there the place was packed. That's impressive for a Thursday night. Of course it's new and everyone wants to try the new place. We were seated quickly. We were given a table by the front windows. They had them open because it was such a nice night. We started looking at the menus and chatting. It took over 15 minutes for someone to come and take our drink orders. About the same time someone else brought us chips and salsa. For 4 people they brought 2 baskets of fresh made chips and two small dishes of salsa. It was very good. It also gave us something to snack on until our drinks came another 15 minutes later. A half an hour to get something to drink is ridiculous. We didn't even order anything from the bar. It was soda, water, and tea. The waiter took our order and we started chatting. There are big TVs everywhere. We watched the pirates lose and then watched the hockey game start (Game 5 of the Stanley Cup). We chatted and did some catching up. I didn't time it but it was over half an hour to get our food. It was probably more like 45-1 hour but I'm being generous and saying at least 30 minutes.  It was rather confusing because there were 2 guys & one chick working our area. We weren't really sure who out actual waiter was. We had to flag one of the 3 down to get refills on our drinks. They got one of our orders wrong. It was completely wrong. One of my sides was wrong. I didn't send it back but it was frustrating.  I had the Chicken and Lime tacos. It had chicken, guacamole, lime and cilantro rice and shredded cheese on two corn taco shells. I don't know what it was but something on the tacos was super sweet. I wondered if they had added sugar to the guacamole or rice instead of salt. You couldn't taste lime, cilantro or guacamole-just sweetness. I ate my side of beans to cut the sweetness.  We flagged down a waiter for dessert menus. He kept telling us they were on the menus at the far end of the table. We kept telling him they weren't. Finally a friend picked one up and showed him. Then he said, \" Oh, they are on the other menus.\" and walked away.  About 20 minutes later he came back to see if we were ready for our checks. We told him that he never brought us dessert menus. He went and got them but by that time we just wanted to leave. It was amazing the lightning speed in which he gave us our checks and brought us our change.  We never complained about anything except my friend who's order was completely wrong and even then she simply said, \"this isn't what I ordered.\" (In a very nice way.).  The whole experience was disappointing. I did taste my friends Enchiladas Verde and they were excellent. Poor service and food that tastes more like dessert than dinner it what got them 2 stars. I hope as they are there longer that their service improved greatly or people will not come back.",

I placed my order and the waitress forgot to put it in. 30 minutes later after asking about my order, I barely received an, I am sorry.  I then ordered the burrito instead. It was caked in salt. Just ground beef wrapped and a sauce over the top, no sides. I really wanted to like this place, it just under performed. I probably would have said, hey there is an exception to poor service, things happen, if they would have confronted it and addressed it. But the Manager never came over and said anything.  I had to pay for the ground beef overly salted, wrapped in a soft shell,  with a sauce over it. I am not looking for a free meal. Just an honest sorry, things happen. It didn't happen tonight. They just wanted me to pay and leave.    Not a fan of this place.",

I also ordered the enchiladas but wanted them with meat. The waiter was polite but didn't speak English very well at all. Her enchiladas arrived and the cheese was cold and not melted. My enchiladas were the same as hers, no meat at all. I told the waiter and he didn't understand so he had to get some me else who spoke English.   My enchiladas came out quickly and we're good, not great really.  Overall the food was ok, the service was ok and the whole experience was just ok. I don't know if we'll be back or not. Hopefully others have a better experience than we did.",

Hard to believe that!  Probably a bad day or so... given him Another chance he is the best in what he does!!! Telling you!!! got that job and he highly recommend totopo days after.

    "text": "We came for late lunch on Mother's Day.  It was Sunday, so there was ample free parking in one of the garages.  The front and bar areas were quite filled, but we didn't wait, and were seated in a booth in the rear.  Our waitress was helpful and offered us free mimosas for the occasion.  The drinks weren't weak on alcohol, despite being of no extra charge, and had bits of fresh orange in them as if made from scratch.  The only unusual things was that we weren't automatically given water upon being seated, though it was offered when the appetizer came.  We ordered the spinach queso dip, which was made tableside and was loaded with spinach and rich, cheese flavor.  The 3 of us ordered from the combo menu (pick 2, plus 2 sides for $12/plate).  The food was simple, packed with the right amount of heat.  It says a lot that none of us used the bottled sauces to add to the dishes!  The salad had a sweet cilantro dressing...i loved it. The chicken posole was the soup of the Day, and had some heat and was loaded with hominy, although the chicken was a little tough.  The black beans and refried beans tastes much cleaner and well-seasoned than most Mexican restaurants, in my experience.  We had a lot of dishes loading down our table, and they were bussed away pretty regularly.  All in all, out bill was $54 for 3 including one $5 bloody Mary, not including tip.  We weren't really looking at prices, so we were pleasantly surprised that we were able to enjoy so much authentic fare (without bean fillers displacing quality ingredients) at such a reasonable price.  We'll definitely return!",

The atmosphere was very casual, and the staff was extremely welcoming. We sat a table in the general bar area, and as we were being escorted to our table, the bartender very warmly welcomed us to the restaurant and made us feel very appreciated.  Our server/s were very attentive, and definitely seemed to be genuinely interested in us having a good experience. The food was outstanding. We ordered the table side guacamole, and it lived up to the hype! The flavora were excellent, the ingredients used were fresh, and was a perfect addition to the complimentary chips and salsa.  My friend and I each ordered different tacos so we could try one of each: the pork and the chorizo. They are served traditional street style on fresh, doubled up corn tortillas. Both were excellent and full of flavor! The accompanying rice and beans were actually really good. Often I find the rice and beans to be mediocre at best at other restaurants... But here, the rice was bursting with flavor and the refried beans were incredibly tasty.   This was a wonderful surprise as yummy, quality, authentic Mexican is hard to find. I plan to not only return here, but to tell my friends about this place too!",

The menu is seemingly authentic and more extensive than other Mexican restaurants in the area. I've really enjoyed their tamales, and their salads also are pretty good. As is typical with Mexican restaurants, the portion sizes are big and I always end up taking some home. It's slightly pricer than other Mexican places, but it makes sense given the ambience, which is usually the defining factor when I decide to go here over other places. I haven't tried their margaritas yet but I've heard good things about them",

There are 12 beers on tap and they had a few great options.  Not a bad atmosphere although I loved when it was walnut (I came here weekly when it was walnut).   The tacos I had were \"skinny tacos\".  They had chicken that was very under seasoned. The \"roasted corn\" kind of tasted like it was just canned corn.  Everything tastes frozen or store bought.   My wife had the fish tacos. They weren't bad but all I could taste was the oil from the deep frier as the batter was very thick and heavy and it sucked up all the oil.   So all in all, I'd say great spot for drinks and some apps (and def get the gauc) but I prob won't get the food again as it was very average.",

    "text": "I'm torn about Totopo. I really like some aspects of the restaurant, and I'll happily eat there again, but it has some huge flaws that just kind of disappoint me.  So The Good: They have the most amazing table-side guacamole. Absolutely the best I've ever had, and I go there when I need a fix. The atmosphere is great, the servers have all been very nice and accommodating, and I love sitting there in the cozy, yet vibrant restaurant. They have a lot of great basic TexMex dishes, and I have enjoyed some of the more \"standard\" meals I've had there.  The Bad: The quality of the food is at what I would call an \"El Campesino\" level. El Campesino is a chain of restaurants where my friends and i would regularly go in college. We'd chow down on chips and salsa and lots of margaritas, and didn't really care that we were eating a cheap variation of what Americans think Mexican food is. So don't go to Totopo and order a steak, because you'll get a really pathetic steak. I ordered mine medium and got a grey slab, the quality of which might be found on the menu at a Denny's. The fiesta rice tasted like it was from a box. And the cheese is cheap as well. Authentic Mexico cuisine this is not.  The Ugly: Simple dishes that should be easy to make are ruined because the restaurant has taken shortcuts and uses boxed or frozen food. A perfect example is the cilantro rice. Should be easy, right? You make rice, you add some salt and pepper and cilantro. The rice was sugary, because they use a mix instead of making fresh food. Same for the lime vinaigrette salad dressing.  It was so sweet and the salad was so drenched that I could barely choke it down. I ended up eating the meat and leaving most of the lettuce on the plate.  So Totopo's is great for a night out with friends and family, as long as you aren't expecting this place to be high-end or upscale, like it's address or atmosphere might suggest. Stick to tried and True favorites like quesadillas, tacos, fajitas, etc., or maybe just go there for drinks and appetizers. It's a satisfying place, just not what i was hoping for in Mt. Lebanon.",

First thing I did was order a Margarita, and it was so good!! it was also pretty large for the price we paid, which made it worth purchasing. We also decided to get their guacamole, and I was so excited when they brought it out. They prepare it at your table, which is the exact same thing they did in Mexico when we were there! It tasted delicious, even my daughter loved it! The entree's were good as well. Lots of food. I definitely want to go back, even if it is just for guac!",

That, combined with a great tap list, great cocktails, a bangin happy hour, and delish cuisine gets this place a 5 cap rating. I have been to Totopo on several occasions. I've had their tacos, dip trio, empanadas, and a few other things, and its all been delicious and freshly made.  I was there recently alone and stopped in at the bar for a quick lunch and a beer. The bartenders are SO friendly - they will chat beer with you, ask you about your day, etc. when other places in the area you are lucky if you get eye contact. Granted, it was slow and I was alone - but I've always had impeccable service here.  This is more of a Tex Mex style of mexican food - but compared to Mad Mex, this place is leaps and bounds beyond the quality of the competition. There is ample parking in the area as well. Sometimes the street parking is hard to find, but there are several side streets and a parking deck that make the entire area accessible.",

They have a nice bar area to sit if you can't get a seat on a busy night. I suggest making reservations since it can get pretty packed. We got a seat at the bar as soon as we walked in, luckily. They had a nice drink menu that offered a lot of variety. I then checked in on yelp and got a choice of free guac or queso! Can't beat that! The guac tasted great. I ordered chicken quesadillas as my dinner and I thought they tasted pretty good. The dessert was my favorite part-churro ice cream! Yum! I wasn't disappointed. This could probably be split between 2-3 people depending on how hungry you are or how much of a churro fanatic you are. Overall it was a nice experience. Music was fun and hip, as well as the general Friday night vibe. I can say it was pretty warm inside the restaurant, which wasn't the most comfortable. Our waiters were very friendly and polite. I can't wait to return to try out happy hour in the future!",

The hard working staff also made for a great experience.  My wife and I had the queso as an appetizer.  Both the chips and the dip were fresh and tasted great.  The dip was not runny and had a perfect cheesy flavor.    For my meal I had the fish tacos.  These were possibly the best fish tacos I have ever had.  The breading was not too thick and you still picked up on the fresh fish flavor.  The toppings and sauce that come with them were perfect choices.  The little bit of heat with the chipotle sauce was balanced out perfectly by the slaw and cilantro.  Both my wife and I cleared our plates, which can be tough to do at Mexican restaurants, but the food was that good.  Will definitely be back soon.",

I truly felt like I was at one of the resorts we stay at in Mexico. This made us excited for our meal immediately.  You get chips and salsa when you sit down. I decided to change things up and get a Mojito because they had multiple flavors to choose from. We also got queso. (If you check in on yelp! You're queso is free!) The drinks and appetizer were both delicious.  For the main course I got a combo of enchiladas, a chicken taco and rice. I must say I LOVE the portion size here. At most mexican restaurants they just give you too much and I feel horrible wasting it. Here it was perfect! My combo meal filled me but I cleared my plate. Both the chicken taco and enchilada were made correctly- and came out quickly even with how busy it was.  Our server was amazing. His name was Joel. He was quick, efficient, and friendly. The food runner brought out my husbands meal wrong at first and as soon as Joel saw he ran over and knew what was needed without even checking. He also recommended us a delicious tequila shot! You couldn't help but smile when Joel was around. Great work!   We honestly did not want to leave. I cannot wait to come back to try a frozen margarita and some fajitas! They also have different specials running every night so check those out too.",

Started with the drink sampler. The Ronchata was the best! Shrimp enchiladas were large and tasty. Sauce was a bit sweeter than I have had in other places but was still good. Like all great Mexican spots they start you off with free chips and salsa. Table side guacamole is always a fan favorite. They asked your spicy level which I loved .

Everyone was so nice and we were never without chips or dips. To start, my friends and I split the dip trip. The queso is white queso and amazing. The guacamole is also outstanding. They also have table side guacamole that I  definitely will be getting next time. The table next to ours got it and it looked really yummy with all the fresh ingredients the server was putting into it. For the main course, I ordered the chicken tacos with refried beans and rice. They had just a little chorizo underneath and the meat was flavored beautifully. My one friend got the steak fajitas and I definitely coveted those bc they smelled terrific when the server brought them out. My other friend got a pick trio. They have the option of picking two or three items and making your own plate. She got a few different tamales and they looked really good. I also ordered the enchiladas Rojas to take home to the hubby and he devoured it. He said that they were amazing. I also can't forget the delicious margaritas. Fresh and the perfect amount of citrus. Loved it! I can't wait to go back and try my items off the amazing menu!!",

Took maybe 5 minutes to have waters brought to us. drink orders took a little long too. Chips and salsa were brought to the table and were excellent, great salsa, little bit of a spice but delicious. The waiter and rest of the staff's interactions were all in good spirits and helpful.   The Happy Hour specials from 4-6 everyday were impressive; half off drafts, house margaritas, and appetizers. The house margarita was tasty, lime and citrus flavored, though didn't seem to be made too strongly.   Food time, the dip sampler is a great start. Guac was smooth but a little underwhelming in flavor. I prefer Chipotle's to theirs.  Queso dip is always tasty.  The food was decent, but I think most Mexican places food is all pretty similar. Specifically here, the chicken was tough and dried out.  Beef had a good flavor though.    Overall a nice place to eat in Mt Lebo, which a market that hasn't been tapped yet there.  I think it will do well, especially if the staff speeds up getting food and drinks to the tables in a timely fashion. but it's a new staff so hopefully with time that is improved.   I do plan to be back for happy hour and dinner again!",

The food was excellent, the service was wonderful and our server, Jesus, was such a lovely person. He patiently allowed us to\"practicar espanol\" with him. When I mentioned that it was a birthday celebration he brought us an extra special dessert(churros in an elaborate sundae) and the whole crew came out and sang Las Mananitas to our grand-daughter (age 8). By the way, each of the 4 adults in our party had to get a take home container. The servings are that plentiful.",

I went with the red Sangria and had drink envy when my fiance ordered a margarita on the rocks-it was one good margarita.   Our waitress was fantastic and brought up complimentary chips and salsa right away and keep the refills going.  We loved that they menu had combo meals where you could choose to pick 2 or 3 items with 2 sides.   I went with 1 tacos & 1 quesadilla and got rice and the tortilla soup as my sides. The taco was ok-went with beef which came with cheese, lettuce and sour cream. Same with the quesadilla nothing special but tasted fine. The rice was very bland and needed some seasoning. The tortilla soup was fantastic and I wish I went with a bigger bowl of it.  The prices are very reasonable and the service was quick.  Overall we had a nice evening of mediocre Mexican food.",

    "text": "was super delighted to hear of this place opening .  not the biggest fan of Mt. Lebanon and it's right-wing political atmosphere in most cases but, this place adds a much more authentic Mexican cuisine element to the South hills area and PGH, in general where it can still be hard to find more authentic/good Mexican grub despite so many Latin immigrants/migrants streaming in to this area all the time. Juan , the maitre'd / host apparently, worked for the Emiliano's Mexican restaurant chain before breaking away to do his own thing.   Walnut Grill was formerly, in this same space and it was never much to write home about, being standard / meh American food and so on . Mt. Lebanon surely needs some international flavor and culture and they have gotten some. The brunch/breakfast burrito was really good with eggs and chorizo ... the tortilla, excuse me, TOTOPOS as they're properly called were really tasty ... especially with their house red salsa and guacamole (that they come to the table to make in front of you... always nice... you know it's fresh, this a way .) there is a nice selection of tequilas and more importantly - MEZCAL, in the bar and there is a mezcal or tequila flight that you can get to sample 3 at a time ... the usual Mexican beers, as well ... more upscale in atmosphere than places like Patron and Rey Azteca but those place are also quite a bit further away if you live in the South hills area even if I do love the food at those places, as well . I hope to dine many more times at Totopo and highly suggest that you give it a try .  salud .",

Almost every time I eat at a Mexican place in Pittsburgh I am not impressed but Totopo definitely impressed me. I got the shrimp enchiladas and cilantro rice and beans. It was so good everything was perfect the rice was so soft and tender. I usually never eat the rice that comes at restaurants since a lot of times it can be dry or over cooked. Not here though it was perfect. The restaurant was fairly busy because it was Friday but our food came out extremely fast. I also got the complimentary queso which I definitely would order again. For drinks I got a house margarita which was half off since it was still happy hour then I ordered a drink with rumchatta and horchata In it both drinks were fantastic. I want to come back and try more thing on their menu! They also have outside seating!",

The two bartenders behind the bar were hustling but thinking a third bartender might have helped. We had to ask for silverware after our meal arrived and was tough to get anyone's attention. I don't know if I would come back on a weekend if it was this tough on a week day to get good service.  The food was ok..just average.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either..forgettable.

    "text": "I decided to stop here for lunch after having seen it was finally open. When I entered I learned they had been open for a week now. They have free WiFi which always comes in handy and I was seated immediately. I noticed that they do have outdoor seating but on a rainy day I prefer indoors.  They offer a Sunday brunch menu but I found the best deal was a build it yourself option. For $8.00 you get a choice of two entrees whether they are tacos, burritos, etc and a choice of two sides. Among these sides are two different choices of rice, two different choices of beans, or a side salad. If you want three entrees then it is $10.00.  I decided to order two different soft tacos-one chicken and one beef along with the side salad and black beans. Each table is given a bowl of tortilla chips and salsa which is a generous portion.  I got my meal and thoroughly enjoyed it. I found the salad just a touch spicy but I had enough drink to wash it down. I was able to chat with folks at a nearby table where they had ordered a bowl of guacamole for dipping. The lady there told me it was just alright but I didn't get to sample it.  It is True that the service is slow but I always thought that if it is prepared the way I like it then it is worth the wait. However, when my waiter brought me my check, I asked for change and later found out he shortchanged me. I drew that matter to his attention and he corrected it saying \"I thought I told him to keep the change.\" He must have seemed confused.  I also learned that even though there are vegetarian options given on this menu, some of these items are not vegetarian. The lady next to me told me that about the beans. I enjoyed my black beans and thought they were very tasty.  I'm allowing some latitude to the fact that they just opened and probably have a lot to learn. A second visit in the future will help me determine if they make these improvements. They have a full bar with TV sets all around but it wasn't overly noisy. Totopo is located on Washington Road in the Mt Lebanon business district near the indoor parking garage. When I asked if they validate parking during the week, the host told me he wasn't sure.",

I ordered two entrees which was pick two dishes with two sides for $12. At the beginning it sounded as a good deal so for the first entree I got two northern tamales, fried beans and rice. The second entree was two tamales, rice and soup. To our disappointment, the portions were small and the food wasn't anything extraordinary. I didn't really like my tamales as the chicken was dry and the masa tasted a bit different than what I'm used to. The portion of the fried beans was a bit less than half the serving cup that it came in. The only thing that was good was the soup. In addition, they gave us free chips but what's the point when there was no salsa?   Overall my takeout experience wasn't that great but perhaps dining in is better. Would I do take out from them again? Definitely no. Would I try dining in to see if the experience is different? I will need some convincing but probably.",

    "text": "We had dinner here a few nights ago. We were very happy with it. I was afraid that the fact that they had clearly spent a lot of effort on the interior design might mean that the food had that canned, corporate feeling to it. That is not the case. The food was all very good. I liked that unlike the typical \"Chi-chi's-esque\" Mexican restaurant, the food here was not just a handful of the same 4 ingredients rearranged in different ways and given different names. The dishes were actually different from each other. The refried beans tasted homemade. Also, the plate didn't come out laden with 10,000 calories, which I liked. I didn't finish eating and look at my plate with regret over what had just transpired. For $10 you can pick two items and two sides, which is what I did. Not only does this make more sense than reading through 42 combo options, but when you pick sides you can even pick soup as a side. You're not wedded to a scoop of rice to fill the space on your plate and in your stomach. And by the way, the tortilla soup was probably the best I've ever had. It was clearly built to a recipe and not just a chicken soup with some cream and spice added. It was full of tortilla strips which made each bite have an interesting texture. In summary: when a place offers a choice between northern or southern tamales, they probably know how to cook Mexican food.",

Not that the kids menu matters to most, but it was disappointing that the chicken fingers and fries were clearly the cheapest frozen kind one can purchase.  The place is sort of confusing as it was touted as being \"authentic\" Mexican but to me seemed very Americanized.

Unfortunately that hasn't improved much. I was surprised the OWNERS NEVER came to the tables to greet the guests in those first few days.  Even when we mentioned issues, no manager or owner stopped by our table.  Although the food is really good, (specialties outstanding) the rice & beans are ALWAYS COLD (even now)  & the salsa is bland.  The biggest complaint though from friends was that instead of the wait staff clearing plates when the guests are done, the bus girl cleaned all the plates into a bus cart at the tables when the guests left.

Stay away from that ripoff. The chorizo queso dip is the best in the city I have had the pleasure of so far. The drowned burrito and chorizopollo are parades of flavor on the palate. I can't wait to try more. I just took my step dad with us to eat and he was impressed. Not easy considering the years we lived on the west coast in Oregon. Food trucks there 15 years ago put most overpriced restaurants here to SHAME. We miss Coffee People, authentic Mexican food, effective public transit, and businesses that actually adhere to their operating hours. Totopo fills a bit of our food scene shaped hole. The staff is friendly and the ambiance is great.  This will be our Mexican place until someone else steals my food loving heart.",

This is a \"fancier\" Mexican joint-- swanky decor and a large well-stocked bar. Prices are a bit higher than your standard Mexican restaurant but it's all very appropriate for the neighborhood.   I'm a huge fan of Mexican food and there are places serving much better (and much cheaper) Mexican food in the city. However, the service was good and the food wasn't terrible.

My boyfriend and I wanted to celebrate Cinco de Mayo early - so we made our way to restaurant around 6:15pm. There was no onstreet parking available, so we parked in a nearby parking lot for $2.   Totopo was celebrating Cinco de Mayo all weekend long, so it was the busiest it's been when I've been there. We had to wait about 35 minutes - they were giving away free prizes, so it wasn't too bad. I won a Totopo glass.   Once we finally got seated - we ordered our drinks. I ordered a strawberry frozen margarita and my boyfriend ordered a original mojito. The bar was a little backed up, but once the drinks came - they were delicious.   To start we ordered the table side guacamole and the taquitos. Everything was amazing!   We both ordered the chicken quesadillas for our entrees- heads up! It's not listed on the menu, but it's chicken, cheese, and green peppers in the quesadilla. My boyfriend had to pick his out since he doesn't like them.   For dessert- he ordered the churros! He said it was delicious!   We will definitely be going back to Totopo soon!",

I really appreciated the free 4oz guacamole that I received for the first check-in, and honestly, it was delicious. There was a lot of garlic and lime and I was pleasantly surprised. I also noticed on the menu that if you order the full size guacamole, they'll make it table side.  I ordered the Totopo salad, but received the tostada salad. Honest mistake that I didn't correct because the names and ingredients overall were very similar. The flavors of the salad were great; I particularly enjoyed the cilantro dressing. However, it was a bit overdressed. Overall it was a fresh salad that I did enjoy, I just didn't finish it once I got to the soggier lettuce.   The real draw back for me was that the service was slowwwww. It was the middle of the day on a weekday, but it was the lunch rush, and things took so long that I was late to a meeting. I would recommend this place for some tacos and margaritas, just not if you're in a hurry!",

We have recently moved from Southern California after living there for over fourty years.  We are used to the best Mexican and Peruvian food available in our country, and enjoy it regularly.  We feared that moving to the Pittsburgh area might put an end to that, but Totopo proved us wrong.  I enjoyed the chicken mole while my wife had the tacos al pastor.  Both entrees were excellent as were the sides, chips and salsas and margaritas.  Our server, Glenn, was most knowledgeable about the history of the food and was polite and attentive throughout dinner.  A real professional.  We also had several short conversations with other staff members, including the manager, and all were informative and polite.  We left feeling content that we now had an excellent place to enjoy our favorite type of cuisine.  We will return often!",

    "text": "Disclaimer: I'm from Texas, where there are Mexican food restaurants everywhere.  I tried to ignore giving this place a review because it makes me sad and miss \"home\".  If I could give this place 2.5 stars I would have.  My husband and I were looking for a place to go that we could both feel like we're home.  We came here for St. Patrick's Day in the evening with full intentions of sitting at the bar.  The bar was unfortunately packed, which was a good sign that maybe the food and/or drinks would be decent.  They had a St. Patrick's Day margarita special.  I think it was a house margarita for $6. The venue was a lot bigger than I thought it would be. Huge bar in the middle of the restaurant with seating behind it and in front of it.    Since we couldn't sit at the bar, we were seated at a table in the front of the restaurant, near a TV since basketball was on (gotta love March Madness!).  Our server was prompt and courteous.  We asked her recommendations, and she said the fajitas were extremely popular.  That is what we ordered.  We decided to try and split it, just in case we didn't like it.  When we asked if we could have an extra tortilla, there was going to be an up-charge of 99 cents. We ended up not getting it because the aren't made in house... Have you ever had fresh made tortillas?  LIFE CHANGER!!!   We also ordered a small queso for our complimentary chips, which was ok.  We definitely killed the whole thing. We got our house margaritas. They were nothing special - green for St. Patty's but I couldn't recommend it to someone I cared about.   Thank goodness we split the fajitas. We ordered the mix up (steak and chicken fajitas).  Both tasted teriyaki flavored or like a stir fry.  We didn't like it, and I could hardly eat one fajita.  It was disappointing. So, in all the restaurant didn't pass our fajitas test, and if I came again I would definitely have to order a margarita with a better quality tequila.  I could see this as a spot for drinks and chips - and that's about it.",

    "text": "There's the average Mexican restaurants, and then a step above the rest that is...Totopo. From the atmosphere to the wait staff to the food. Speaking of food, come hungry. If you overdo it on the chips and salsa, there won't be any real estate left in your belly for all the delectable deliciousness. The Pick 2 or Pick 3 options gives you the most variety from classics like enchiladas and burritos to the rarer menu finds like tamales, with both Northern and Southern styles available. It's also one of the few places in the Pittsburgh area that offer seafood-based tacos, such as grilled shrimp or fried cod. Every meal comes with a your choice of sides, but I recommend the customary fiesta rice and beans (and this is coming from someone that doesn't really do beans of any type!). This is simply a great addition to the Lebo food scene on Washington.",

My boyfriend and I were feeling it from the moment we walked in. The fresh chips (amazing) and salsa were brought promptly to our booth and devoured just as quickly. I took advantage of the complimentary queso dip with the Yelp check-in and boy oh boy, am I glad I did! OUTSTANDING. My boyfriend ordered the shrimp tacos and said they rival the best he's ever had. I ordered the steak fajita nachos, and not only are they gorgeous to look at, they're equally scrumptious. My boyfriend had a late barber appt across the road so I moved to the bar to enjoy a frozen peach mango margarita while he got a haircut. The margarita was great, blended perfectly, & equal parts sweet and tequila.  Do yourself a favor and go give this place a try if you haven't already .... sooooooo good!",

You can always judge a Mexican restaurant on their salsa and Totopo had fantastic salsa.   This place is much better than other sit-down Mexican restaurants I've found in the area. Plus it's very upscale inside and, of course, is situated in the adorable business district of Mt. Lebanon.",

I usually don't like fish on tacos but they were so meaty and didn't taste too fishy like other fish tacos I've had in the past.

Mya was the manager handling the event, and she was very patient throughout my many calls and questions. She let me know ahead of time that she wasn't going to be there the day of, and she was very careful to share all of the information with those who would be there. This attention to good communication was very noticed and very helpful! Everything was set up as we discussed. The server, Gabby, had been well informed. The other manager already knew about the tech needs/set-up. All of the staff seemed genuinely interested in making sure the event was a success, and I really appreciated that! The room was very nice - clean, private, and great decor. The LCD was easy to use. They quickly found things we needed to hang a few decorations. Setting up was easy, and it looked great! The food was good. We had a buffet that included salad, 2 appetizers, and fajitas. I've eaten at Totopo several times before, and we really enjoyed those previous meals! The buffet wasn't quite as excellent, but still good. I just chalked it up to the difference between an individual meal and a buffet. And the price was very reasonable for an all-you-can-eat buffet that included non-alcoholic drinks. And the guests enjoyed having Mexican food instead of the traditional graduation cook-out.  The facility and customer service really made this an amazing experience. They were genuinely friendly, and that makes such a difference! My son, family, and friends had a great time. Thanks Totopo!",

Unless you are a fan of cilantro (I am NOT!!), skip the salad. The other options for dressing just didn't work for me; they were generic and bland. We didn't order drinks, but they did have a nice size bar with lots of options. The others in my party had salads and loved them! Again, cilantro is like poison to me; so I would not have ordered them. We didn't have leftovers, but were definitely full. Give it a try and let me know what you think!",

Pros: Free chips and salsa, good margaritas, good side salad.  The first time I got tacos al pastor and the pork was very fatty. I couldn't eat most of it. Similar issue with my second experience, ordering a chicken burrito. They don't trim their meat well at all. The chicken was gristly and sinewy and very hard and unpleasant to chew. Perhaps in their dishes where their meat isn't already cut, the food is better. But the other ingredients didn't make up for the poor cuts of meat. There are better local Mexican chains and restaurants I'd got to again before going here, for a meal at any rate, though for drinks I might stop in. Even places I've reviewed before and wasn't impressed with, as at least they aren't as pricey as Totopo.",

My friend and I chose a late lunch on a Saturday to try Totopo and both were completely satisfied with the choice. Quick and friendly service. Our server was a little hard to hear; a soft talker but attentive. We ordered the tableside quac to go along with the chips and very tasty salsa. The quac is definitely suited for four people but we nearly polished it off ourselves because it was creamy and fresh and prepared with just enough of each ingredient that not one of the flavors overpowered the other. My friend ordered from the combo menu (enchilada and mushroom quesadilla) and I ordered the fish tacos. Hearty portions at very reasonable prices. Washed it all down with house margaritas. In my opinion it beats Emiliano's hands down.",

I continually made excuses why we shouldn't drive outside the city until finally we committed to going on a Friday night. Totally worth it!   First, it was really crowded. The line was out the door so expected a long wait, but when we checked in they told us only 30 minutes. We waited by the bar for our table and browsed the drink menu. Aside from the obvious margaritas, they have a ton of options. We didn't drink, but made a note to go back just for happy hour.   Once we were seated we were quickly greeted by our server who went over changes/updates to the menu and brought us chips and salsa.   We started with the cheese empanadas and table side guac. I've had some of the best home made empanadas so I'm a total critic. If anyone knows of any other cheese empanadas in the city, please let me know so I can try them... anyway, these ones were actually really good. I was surprised how much I liked them. I'll for sure be ordering them again on our next trip. The guac wasn't my favorite. For $12 I'd skip it. Dinner I ordered the Apollo Chorizo tacos. By this point you're too full to eat basically anything... but they were so good! I frequently seek out chicken chorizo tacos all over he city and can say these are right on top with others I've had.   If you think you've had the best Mexican in Pittsburgh, I challenge you to add this to your list.",

We came around 6:30 on a Friday night and the wait ended up being only about 10 minutes when they said 20 minutes. They start you off with the house salsa which was nice! Also, make sure to check in on yelp and get some queso or guac! We went with the guac and it was delicious as well with the perfect amount of lime! We then started with the spinach queso dip and was unimpressed. There was so much spinach that I barely tasted any of the queso. For our main meal, I had the choripollo tacos and my friend had the drowned burrito. We had just gotten our queso, when our main meals had arrived. Would have preferred to have them more spread out. The drowned burrito was huge, definitely closer to two servings. The choripollo tacos were good! It came with two salsas that definitely added flavor. Overall, the food was good but nothing exceptional.",

    "text": "I love discovering new places I haven't heard of.  When that place just happens to serve Mexican fare, I am all in.  Totopo delivered on both aspects for me.  We showed up midday, after the lunch rush and before dinner rush was to start.  This allowed us to be seated right away and making for stellar service.  We had menus in hand and were given a few minutes to look it over.  I wanted to try just about a bit of everything, just because.  The best way to accomplish this is perhaps opting for a combo.  If you do choose the combo you have to then decide just how hungry you are.  You have your choice of a two or three entree combo.  Knowing how I always overdo it, I went with the two entree combo so I wouldn't be a lump on the world later.  With this I decided that I would give the burrito and enchilada verde a try.  The burrito is made up of a flour tortilla filled with your choice of ground beef or chicken, I went with the ground beef.  Then it is topped with a roasted tomato salsa.  The enchilada verde you have a choice of ground beef, chicken or cheese, I opted for ground beef again.  Then it is topped with cheese sauce, tomatillo sauce and sour cream.  The best thing about both is that the tortillas that are used are made in house and fresh.  You can actually see them being made if you have a good enough seat.  I watched for just about the whole length I was here and was impressed by how many they must make in a day.  Now, with a combo you get a choice of two sides.  The sides are your basic selections you would expect from a Mexican restaurant.  Black beans, fiesta rice, refried beans, soup of the day and a side salad.  I went with the refried beans and the side salad, which they call Casa Side Salad.  The Casa Side Salad is a mixed greens based salad with tomatoes, topped with a cilantro dressing and tortilla strips.  For my safety due to allergies, I removed the tortilla strips.  The salad was amazing and a great way to start the meal.    Everything tasted amazing.  I was over the moon with everything.  My stomach was doing a happy dance.  Or that could have been the Mexican Mojito I had.  I was so impressed by the service we had that I will be back here in the future and I will be filling myself with some amazing Mexican food.",

Between two windows but I would have rather sat directly in front of the window instead of in the middle of two. This is really just a minor issue, it was a pretty day and the windows were open. The restaurant was not busy at tables only at the bar.  We ordered the table side guacamole. The man asked us if we wanted it extra picoso and we said yes. After he made the guacamole and we tasted, it was definitely missing 2 things. Salt and lime! For as much as we paid for that I would expect it to be perfect. The molcajete was cute but let's make sure the food tastes good it's not just about presentation.   We both ordered carne asada. It was fine, there was nothing notable.  I asked the waitress if the corn tortillas were made fresh. She said everyday. I'm honestly really confused about this because the tortillas they served us were DRY even in foil after being steamed. Not pliable at all. Looked and tasted like store bought mission tortillas.  My husband had a couple beers and ordered a tamarindo margarita. It was too sweet. I couldn't have any because I'm pregnant but I'll take his word for it. He said it didn't taste like alcohol just pure sugar.   We finished off dinner with a pastel de tres leches. This was actually the star of the meal. I will say though. The cake was a little bit too gritty. I've made many pastel de tres leches and you really have to get the right ratio of eggs in this recipe to make sure it's night and fluffy and not too heavy. This one was very heavy and gritty, but it was still pretty good.",

Lebanon area on a Wednesday night with my family looking for a restaurant, and Totopo popped up on Yelp with a plethora of positive reviews, so we decided to give it a shot. In the end, we were all pleased and looking forward to trying it again in the future.  We were greeted cheerfully by staff and grabbed seats in their side room, away from their surprisingly crowded main dining room and bar. Shortly thereafter, our server dropped off complementary fresh chips and delicious, moderately spicy salsa. Throughout our night there, service was efficient, present, and very friendly from the entire staff.  I ordered a smothered steak burrito. It had steak, large helpings of peppers and onions, rice, and was utterly covered in salsa and cheese. As large as the burrito was, I wasn't weighed down afterwards since it had a higher proportion of meat and vegetables to rice.  My family were all rather pleased with their dishes. My mother raved about her salad, my dad enjoyed his healthy serving of enchiladas, and my wife spoke well of her chicken burrito, but stated that the quesadilla was good, but nothing spectacular.  Eating at Totopo was such a pleasant experience that I would go out of my way to come back their with friends and family to eat. Give it a shot when you're in the mood for Mexican food.",

We each ordered different items for dinner, and were all pleased with our choices. The food was all fresh and flavorful, but I'd try something other than the enchiladas rojo next time - they were a bit heavy for me.   FYI- We thought we ordered the Yelp check-in offer guacamole, but they brought us the table side guacamole.

    "text": "Not your average Mexican Restaurant. Lovely decor and bar.  There are many tables and a separate room for possibly groups.  Meals are served on heavy plates and no paper napkins here.  Cloth is a step above. Really outstanding menu with well prepared dishes.    Friendly service by Morgan who was so efficient, I will be asking for her on my next visit.  And, yes I plan on coming here often.  Before our chip bowl was empty, but with smaller chips, Morgan appeared with a loaded bowl of fresh chips.  There are many options on the menu I want to try.  I like the veggie options and the lettuce wrap tacos.  The jicama chips are freshly cut sticks of jicama with a savory dusting of a spice.  The build your own is a good concept.The guacamole is made table side if you want the large portion  A YELP check-in will score you a choice of a small guac, or queso.    They do a Happy Hour from 4 to 6pm.  A discount of $1 on beers, half price house margaritas and half off appetizers, except the guacamole.  Parking along the street can be a challenge but a small public lot is not far away on a side street.",

I got the al pastor tacos, which had hardly any pork on them but we're full of raw onions. My husband got the cilantro lime chicken tacos. They were much fuller than my pork ones, but the chicken was so incredibly dry that they were not good at all. The rice served with the tacos had no flavor.  I will say, we did have good service sitting at the bar. The house margaritas and chips & salsa were both very good. Next time, I think we will just go for drinks & eat elsewhere.",

It was the same cheese in my enchiladas so they were hard when they got to the table. Also my waitress was very sweet but couldn't understand a lot of what we were saying and sometimes needed to get another waitress to help translate. For example we didn't want sour cream, but the waitress brought out extra sour cream and charged us a dollar for it.",

We decided to hit up Totopo and we were Not disappointed!   The location is fantastic and beautiful inside, though parking kinda sucks and they do not have a private lot.   However let me say this....    THE BEST GUACAMOLE DIP I HAVE HAD SINCE PIPI'S IN PUERTO VALLARTA, MEXICO! Made to order at your table, fresh, ripe and absolutely wonderful.   A lot of mexican/ spanish restaurants are hit or miss on certain items, but everything was on point here. Even at 10:20pm at night! Everything from there spanish rice which has a great flavor, to their refried beans which were very fresh.   There signature Chimichanga with chicken are fantastic. Filled with a ton of flavored shredded chicken, topped with queso and signature sauce drizzled on top.   prices are on point as well.",

We've tried the tacos, tamales, burritos, chimichangas, and more. We've never had a bad meal. Margaritas are also great-I like them with the Corralejo tequila.

The drinks & food were great. The service however was terrible. Our waiter (Fernando) gave us attitude for asking for more salsa chips... (we ordered the queso dip and made to order guacamole). They only give you alittle bowl with chips so I didn't understand what the issue was. We ordered margaritas and I got the Mango one and my husband got the traditional. Both good. The server asked if either of us wanted another drink and my husband said yes. 30 minutes go by and he never received his drink. The food came, which what I got was delicious (pollochorizo)- it was chicken breasts with queso and ground sausage, came with soft tortillas, pico and sour cream. Delicious.   We felt alittle better after eating our food, and instead of spending more $$$ on drinks since he never cared to bring the last ones and seemed like he was rushing us out (it was not busy there for being a Tuesday night so I didn't understand that).   Our bill came out to $73.95 without a breakdown of the items we got. My husband said it didn't look right at all as he calculated what we ordered. It was $17 more than what it should've been. We confronted the server and he said that was correct. I added the items on my phone calculator to show him and it was $17 more. He went in the back to check after I told him I wanted the breakdown. He came back and said it was $17 more he \"accidentally\" added extra items.  I was beyond furious. You would think he would've offered some sort of discount or took an appetizer off of the bill since that took an extra 20 minutes to prove we were correct.   Food was good, but there are PLENTY of places in pgh I'd rather go to. I can't believe the service we received. I should've complained to the Manager but I honestly did not want to stay there any longer.   Beware of items getting added on your bill. Seems like they may be doing that to more customers....  Will not be returning.",

I was especially nervous about this date. This restaurant had a lot of reviews and was close by after some shopping. I was so hungry I almost fainted in the mall bathroom....  On the fly, we chose this restaurant. I was worried I'd eat alone since there's been some stupid hiatus with supper. Anyways, we were seated within ten minutes after free parking in a side street garage. (Machine was broken)   I utilized a yelp redeemable where we could choose between cheese or guac. Nervously, i chose cheese dip. Should've went guac, because we ended up getting guac anyway.   I ordered pork tacos with pineapple salsa. This was great, just was missing one thing. I asked for sour cream but just can't pin point what it was missing. Don't get me wrong, they tasted fine...just need something.   The salsa, cheese and chips I could eat all day ...on a deserted island..it's what I would choose.   I loved my frozen mango marg.   I also loved the lady who came out and represented the homemade guac while mixing it up right in front of us. Back to original thought, should've not gotten cheese and ordered guac.   Overall, I was happy. The street this place is on also intrigued me for possible future dates.",

We also had steak fajitas - steak was cooked perfect, and the table side guacamole (which for my taste needed garlic, and lime, but guacamole is very per person)",

    "text": "So...I am not sure I really get the RAVE reviews, but my meal was good.  I sat at the bar with a book.  The decor is typical Mexican restaurant - bright and loud - nothing special and nothing bad.   The bar service was good.      For my meal, I enjoyed the chips and salsa to start.  And I asked for a small side of guacamole.  I know they have it as an appetizer, but I was just one person and didn't want the whole hoopla of tableside preparation.   The side was very small - not much more than a tablespoon or two - and it was sort of watery.   The combo though, was good.  I got the chili relleno and the southern tamale.  Both had good flavor and were really filling.  The salad dressing was very good, though the greens were a little wilted.     All in all - a solid pick.",

We stopped here after a shopping trip the area. This is in the area of a variety of shops and food places in this area which is up on the south hills of the city. This is in line with other places but the reviews gave us the idea.   Chips and salsa on the table - and we opted to get the guacamole - which is CUSTOM MADE AT THE TABLE AND IS A HUGE MORTAR AND PESTLE presentation. Was really impressed.   Plus it was incredibly good  However- I got the big burrito, and the insides was just regular rice and crisp vegetables. When I think burritos I think orange rice and Spanish rice and fajita type vegetables.   Just wasn't Mexican to me. Burrito was more like what a family makes at home on their \"Mexican night\"   I'll get something else next time.   Guacamole carried this though,",

I'm glad I gave it another chance, because you shouldn't really judge a place on their takeout unless they specialize in it or are known for that like Chinese food is.   The food was super tasty this time around and glad we made the choice to dine in. I ordered a burrito bowl with chorizo and I'd have to say the chorizo really made the dish. It had a slight kick and was delicious!   I also loved the table side gauc, it had a really great lime taste and was obviously super fresh. I would definitely order this every time I stop in. I also thought the chips were great and fresh out of the fryer. Hot and crispy, with a slight kick to the salsa too. Although I do prefer a chunkier salsa, theirs is a bit on the runny side.  The windows opening up to Washington Road on a beautiful day are just  the cherry on top of a really nice place to hit up when you're craving Mexican. Plus, service was quick and very friendly. Happy to come back soon, I need that gauc again!",

The Chili Relleno was also excellent & I will order it if I go back. Even the flan was pretty damn good. The recommendation was spot on, & if it wasn't for the town it was in I'd go back often.

Ivan was our server and he was quite possibly the best server we have had in a long time. So polite, fast, efficient and patient. He made our experience a million times better and I would honestly come back just for him to take care of us again.   Their menu offers a bunch of vegetarian options, but does not mention any vegan options -NO FEAR, they have so much to offer! Just ask :)   You can get plain white rice instead of their fiesta rice (which is made with chicken stock) and their cilantro rice has a small amount of dairy.   The refried beans and black beans both have the option to be vegan, double win! Just be sure to mention no cheese on them for the vegan option.   I chose to get the veggie fajitas which are sauteed in vegetable oil, no butter! The fajitas came with zucchini, squash, onions, bell peppers and mushrooms. They were perfectly prepared, not over cooked and mushy.   Ivan was beyond helpful making sure everything came out perfect. The food was soooo delicious and better than other fajitas I've had in the area. I left full, happy and even with a box of left overs!   My husband chose to go with the Taco Tuesday options. He really enjoyed the chicken chorizo and beef tacos.   We look forward to coming back and enjoying yet another perfect meal....",

The guacamole being prepared in front of you is what most women would line up to snap for their Instagram story. After that you will want to refrain from posting pictures of yourself because you will be stuffed from both pre dinner chips, guacamole, and salsa and your meal.  I ordered the fajita quesadilla because I could not decide between one or the other so I decided to \"have my cake and eat it too.\" Also ordered a mango margarita which was sweeter than what I expected but was a pretty good size.  I've failed you in not having a picture of my meal but hope a pic of a marg and my word is enough to get you here.",

The table side guacamole is delicious and just a little spicy although you can tell them if you want it more or less spicy. Free salsa and tortillas for the table which is fairly common but some places don't do it! I loved the shrimp enchiladas and quesadillas are good too.

No, they don't have the generic menu (no \"Speedy with Rice\" on this menu), and their food is fresh and well prepared.  And the service is good.  That said, I want to love this place, but I cannot find anything special enough to bump them up to four stars.  It's pretty standard, and it is well executed.  Give them a try and post a review.",

The homemade churros for dessert with ice cream and fried ice cream are always a good idea, so save room. Every time we leave we cannot wait to come back. We haven't had a bad meal or service!",

It was packed, but worth the wait. The food was very delicious and flavorful. The service was just as great. It didn't take long for the food to be served either even with a huge party they were hosting in the side room.   The only complaint I have, it's not really even a complaint, but the frozen mango margarita wasn't strong. I like to taste my tequila and I couldn't. Haha. It was still tasty though.    I will definitely be back and will recommend to others! Thank you Totopo.",

    "text": "So my Girlfriend and I went to Totopo on Cinco de Mayo, real original I know. We were totally accepting of the fact that we would probably be walking into a shit show, however, from start to finish we had an incredible experience. Before we could even get settled at the bar, Jesus greeted us with a warm smile, took our drink order and even helped us pick the perfect tequila to sip on. He was back with our libations before we could even crack open the menu. Once we got our bearing's he arrived once more with complimentary chips and salsa and took our order. We started with the taquitos which were fantastic. I recommend requesting a lime wedge with them, as they benefit greatly from a little acidity. For my entree I did the pick 3 combo for 14$, which is a great way to sample multiple items. I chose a roja cheese enchilada, verde chicken enchilada and chili relleno. Everything was just superb, one offense I find with some Mexican restaurants is under seasoning their meat, but that is certainly not the case at Totopo. My GF had tortilla soup and Choripollo Asado, which is an amazing blend of shredded chicken and chorizo served with fresh made tortillas. She was in Heaven. Even though the place was packed with anxious, and somewhat obnoxious patrons, the staff kept their composure and from what I could tell, turned out fabulous consistent customer service. We will most certainly be back, and hopefully Jesus will be behind the Bar.",

I started off with the beef nachos, which were some of the best nachos I've had in a long time. The presentation was great, everything  tasted fresh and unlike most places that are conservative with their sour cream, this place piled it on, which I love because I love sour cream. They were delicious. Then I had the grilled steak burrito which was fantastic, the best part about it was the house salad it came with. I don't know what the dressing was that came on it but it was amazing, I've never had anything like it, I couldn't put my fork down. As for the burrito, it was delicious. The steak was cook perfectly. For desert I had the fried ice cream, which came out looking like it belonged at a 5 star restaurant. It tasted incredible and fresh as well. My server, Juan, was great, very attentive. My drink never went low. He was very polite and professional. I recommend that you stop in if you're in the area. Totally worth it.",

    "text": "Well Uptown has FINALLY received the Mexican restaurant it has needed for so long!!! Totopo (Aztec for chips...) opened today. Stopped in for lunch and the place was already busy without so much as a balloon launch or spotlight in the sky. I was promptly greeted by a super friendly staff person who sat my party down in the festively decorated bar area. I ordered a 'pick two' combo (could have picked three but not that hungry) option. One has a choice of tamales, stuffed poblano, etc. etc. I ordered the tamales southern style and northern style with cheese. You also pick two sides so I had a cilantro rice dish and black beans w/ cheese. Everything was fresh and amazing. The black beans were clearly NOT from a can but the good dried variety. My friend ordered the chicken tacos and they looked awesome/authentic. Other friend had a grilled chicken burrito and he was very happy! Everyone received free chips and fresh salsa. Looking around I see a whole bunch of other meals I need to try. Oh, and they have a pretty amazing happy hour from 4-6p... Between this and Jade Grille I will never go hungry along Washington Road!",

The service left a little to be desired (our order didn't come out correctly despite us being the only patrons in the dining room). There is also room to improve on some of the details, like the chips and taco shells obviously not being made fresh in-house, but overall the quality of the food is excellent. My tamale tasted authentic, the salsa is the best I have had so far in Pittsburgh, and the enchiladas were great. Highly recommended.",

Excellent guacamole, salsa and chips and the girl bartender who suggested I'd be satisfied with her house margarita, my most often go-to drink, was correct. The food delivered around me was well-portioned and plates were empty when they were bussed away. Reasonably priced, and clean, it's a good place to have a drink without a crushing scene. It's a low key but friendly vibe. I returned the next day for huevos rancheros for brunch. The eggs were cooked perfectly, sauce a little on the salty side but edible. I'd definitely return on my next trip to Mars.",

    "text": "My husband and I were on a house hunting trip prior to our move from Houston and were excited we found this place. We came in about 3pm on a Sunday and we're greeted warmly by the staff.  Received chips and salsa almost immediately. A very attentive waiter brought us \"complimentary\" queso which was just thinned, heated white American cheese. No other flavoring. Salsa was overly tomato flavored and without many typical onion, cilantro and pepper chunks. We ordered a pitcher of house margaritas on the rocks which were okay. Mostly ice and little Margarita.   We both ordered combination plates with tamales, a chicken taco and a chili relleno with refried beans and rice. The rice and beans were nothing special. I have had better rice from a box at home. My chicken taco turned out to be a ground beef taco. We called the waiter over who apologized and said a new one would be sent out. Well it never appeared. Both tamales were in a \"corn dough\" that was more like a stiff corn pudding than a True masa shell. The filling was very scant and not very flavorful. The chili relleno filling was not tasty but the roasted poblano pepper was very good. We received our bill and the \"complimentary\" queso was charged and nothing was taken off for the taco mistake. Our waiter said next time we come back there wouldn't be any mistakes. He is correct because there is not going to be a next time.",

IT SHOULD BE THE STANDARD FOR ALL PITTSBURGH ESTABLISHMENTS .  the north hills and other area Mexican places are tired and have lost appeal. In fact Patron another Mexican restaurant  is more like a fast food place with its loud , echoey building and hideous slapped together patio that looks more like a third world design than an American one, watery, artificial margaritas and cheap decor.  El camp has bland food , artificial margaritas,  poorly presented food and tables and chairs that are wobbly, Unclean and in need of replacement.   We love to TOTOPOS fresh juices used in the margaritas and the peach frozen one is also amazing.their table side molcajete served guacamole is very good. The tomatillo sauce is superb, thick, rich unlike other places which is watery and thin.   We had attentive service both times we went, we sat at the bar because we like adult like ambience, not families .  Our food arrived quickly. I wish they opened later on Sunday's . They close at 9 .   We loved the tamales in corn husks, pork tacos al pastor, flavorful refried beans and the corn soup was delectable . I wish they had chicken soup daily on the menu but they seem to rotate their soups . Food and serving trays and plates are ornamental . It seems like other Mexican places have lost the art of food presentation.   We enjoyed the music here too.   I would like a tv screen to show something other than sports though. Sports inside Mexican establishments diminishes  the quality and experience of the cultural ambience. I would suggest management should play a travel channel or broadcasts footage of Mexico on a screen to promote the culture and food instead of all of the screens showing distractive sports   It is clear that the management cares about quality. I hope they keep it up and don't let their guard down and become like all the other Mexican places have in the region. I hope they don't dumb down to Pittsburgh palates and destroy their good  food.  I hope they will not let the bar be overcome with sports channels. This is not a sports bar. Sports are not relaxing to the mind , ears or eyes   ^^ I will say the chicken in the taco salad is tasteless and the dressing is not good. it's too sweet and thick . The pre made margaritas are good, but are too orangey. Less orange would be better. Traditional margaritas are made with lime or lemon  Overall we will be back and are happy.",

The whole environment feels pretty nice--lighting and music are at comfortable levels, the restaurant and restrooms are kept clean, and the staff are generally welcoming. The menu seems pretty standard and isn't one of those where you choose among 50 different combinations of meats, tortillas, and refried bean sides. The fajitas looked like a major part of the menu, so we got the mix 3 with chicken, steak, and shrimp. While waiting we snacked on the warm tortilla chips, but we didn't have to wait too long for the fajitas to come out sizzling. It was a very decent portion with as much or even more meat than the peppers and onions. We found it all to be seasoned well with lots of flavor, and the meats were all cooked perfectly. There were also the standard sides of lettuce, salsa, cheese, rice, and beans. It was a very satisfying meal--plus if you check in on Yelp, you can sample some of their guac.",

First, the salsa and chips were loaded with fresh ingredients and taste. I really liked the salsa, it was nice & thick and stuck to the chips. Tuesday's are two-dollar taco, with premium tacos for three-dollars. I had two of the skinny-tacos; large leaf lettuce takes the place of the taco shell. They were spot on perfect. One of the two tacos was part of my combo plate. The combos give you a choice of two menu items with two sides. Frijoli's and Black beans were my sides and both were filled with flavor and delicious. The other side of my combo was a burrito, smothered in a peppery tomato sauce. Overall, you couldn't find a better place for Mexican cuisine.",

    "text": "Totopo is a relatively recent addition to Washington Road, and I'm going to be honest: they're a welcome breath of fresh air in comparison to the restaurant they replaced. The last place at this address seemed to vary in quality on an almost daily basis. Not Totopo. Every time I come here their servers impress me and the meals make me smile - as well as roll on out to stumble into a food coma.   Literally the worst thing I can say about Totopo is that their bar service once got a little slow on a busy night. That's not even a complaint so much as an observation of normal events in a restaurant. Heck, it's not even the norm - normally, service is prompt all around. And no matter how busy they've been, the bar hasn't made a single bad drink yet; my family and I visit often enough that we're working our way through the drink menu, and we love it all. (So far I recommend their mojitos above everything else.)  Food-wise, everything I've eaten here has been golden. If I had to make a few recommendations, the table-side guacamole and saving room for some dessert would be my top two. I can't name anywhere in the city that makes a better guacamole, as Totopo makes it tableside for you. And as difficult as saving room for sweet treats can be at a place like this, you'll absolutely want to save enough room to split their churros with someone. Nothing beats Totopo's fresh churros, which come in a bowl of ice cream and whipped cream that needs to be shared with someone. Unless you're ready to die from a sugar overdose. Which might not be a terrible way to go!  Needless to say, I'll be back to enjoy the dishes Totopo has to offer - whether I decide to get enchiladas, a burrito, or their surprisingly tasty skinny tacos...who knows, but I know it'll be good!",

They did come out with a salsa verde and a spicy sauce (I think it was a chipotle sauce) on the side. The fish tacos also could've used a bit more flavor. They were better with some salsa though. I thought the sides of rice and beans were also just ok; I still feel like I've had better.

Additionally, the fajitas was huge but only came with 3 small tortillas. Extra tortillas are $2 each time.   Overall, great food and atmosphere! Just double check your receipt and ask if things come in additional costs.",

Anything I've had there has had really good components, but the rice and beans on the side is always lacking.  They're just rice and beans.  Nothing special about them.  Now, I will say, the table side guacamole and the choriqueso appetizer are both fantastic, but nothing else has wowed me enough to trek up to Lebo.  Little Tokyo?  Absolutely.  Totopo?  Eh...  Side note:  the margaritas that come out of the machine are LIGHTYEARS better than any cocktail I've had made by the bartenders.  I feel like that should be the other way around.  Sometimes, all I want is a margarita with patron silver, triple sec, lime, and a few orange slices, without salt.  Everywhere I go, bartenders are perplexed by this.  Why?  It's the simplest margarita ever.  Ok, the hipster bar only knows how to \"elevate\" their everything, but I should DEFINITELY be able to get that in a Mexican restaurant.  sigh",

On our last visit on a Saturday night we were quoted a 25 to 30 minute wait but it was about 10 minutes.  We ordered drinks and they come out in reasonable time.  Before our drinks arrived we were served fresh warm chips and salsa.  My Mahi Mahi tacos were cooked perfectly and tasty with sides fiesta rice and refined beans that were good.

My husband was done eating his meal before my food came.  Not to mention when our waiter came back to \"apologize\" he told us \"sorry, I haven't been feeling well tonight.\"  Great - exactly what I wanna hear from my server.  Won't be back.

I had a Yelp coupon that got a 4oz guacamole for free if we checked into the restaurant on the app so I did that and I could immediately tell the manager was not happy I used that coupon. Then my child's meal came and while my daughter was eating it we found a long black hair in the rice. I called Marco over and showed him the hair and asked for a new meal to replace the soiled one that was delivered to us. He apologized, took the plate and when the manager brought the replacement meal out she didn't speak...no apology...just dropped off the plate. Of course while eating we were cautious with every bite after what we saw from that point on. The whole time while we were eating the manager glared at my wife and I to the point where it was uncomfortable. We finished our meals, got the check and ended up being charged for the  guacamole AND the meal with a hair in it. I asked Marco to fix the bill due to our coupon and hoped that upon second look we would also leave without paying for food that had hair in it. The corrected check came back with the kids meal still on it. I didn't want to cause any problems for Marco so we decided to leave our first visit to Totopo and make it our last.",

The restaurant is nice on the inside, nothing spectacular. We ate on the patio which could definitely use some sprucing up...but it's been the same since the space was Molly Branigan's so it was as expected.   The food was okay. My husband got the chicken fajitas, which were a bit dry (they actually were fantastic heated up on the stove the next day though). I got the steak and chili, which was incredibly spicy. I'm a huge fan of spice, but I had to remove the entire pepper from my plate because of the heat factor.  The staff was super polite and sweet, but extremely slow. There were guests behind us (a table of 4) who were seated before us and didn't get their meals by the time we left.   All in all, I would probably go back and give them another shot, but my expectations will be much lower.",

The sides of rice and beans were good accompaniments. Recommend to anyone.",

Brunch has only a few options available for the meal, but both of ours were very good. One slight downfall was the orange juice served with the mimosas seemed of poor quality. But for a drink special, I overlooked it. Excited to go back again!",

The server did explain that the only margarita made fresh by the glass was \"El Jefe\", so I ordered it. A little sweet and orangey for my taste, but that is just my preference. My partner ordered  chicken and chorizo, which was served in a molcajete with a side of aalad, rice, tortillas and beans. Outstanding! I had a combo of chile relleno and enchilada verde. It was perfect. Ingredients fresh, spices and flavors were distinct, and the servings generous but not in a ridiculous way. We will definitely be returning. Bienvenido a Mt Lebanon, Totopo!",
