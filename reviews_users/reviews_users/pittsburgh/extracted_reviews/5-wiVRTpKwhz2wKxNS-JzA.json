Definitely ordering from here again!",

I was excited that you could get your chicken tossed in any sauce so I just got hot and said wanted ranch dressing and nachos.  The salad was bigger than I was expecting.  I was disappointed in the tossed chicken.  It looked like they just poured hot sauce on top of my salad because I it was everywhere on top.  Then as I was mixing it up the bottom was all watery.  I was checking my receipt and noticed I was charged 50 cents for dressing.  Who orders a salad and it not come with dressing?",

They are cooked just right too, not soggy or over done. I don't mind well done wings but soggy are the worst! I'd rather wait longer for a properly cooked wing, which they do just right! Had the cheesesteak, bacon wrapped hot dog (ya it's incredible) and their wontons several times too! Perfect place for bar/game-time food! Also, getting charged for an extra dressing is pretty standard. I noticed a previous complaint about that and the cost of wings. The fact is, if you want good quality food products they cost a bit more. Other wise you can enjoy your dollar meal at McD's! Love this place, sometimes takes a little longer to wait but is worth it! Keep our local businesses around peoples and support them!",

The first time must have been an off night for them because this time the wings were cooked perfectly and the sauces on our wings were delicious.  I am a big fan of the jalepano gold wings.  I also got the chicken gyro which was huge and tasted wonderful.  We tried the old bay ranch, which were good but not to our taste (just our personal taste, we don't eat many things with old bay seasoning so if you love that, you will probably love these, we just wanted to try something different).  We also got the buffalo chicken wontons and the jalepano poppers which were good, but nothing that knocked my socks off.    Over all, I had a much better experience this time and I will definitely go back again.",

They serve decent sized wings but some were overcooked and extremely hard so hard that we couldn't even eat most of the wing. Buts not the worst part, ordering 51 wings you would think you'd get some variety of sauces. No, you get 2, for 51 wings 2 sauces. Oh and you get a small cup of ranch, 1 small cup. Extra is 50 cents per cup. I was also charged a dollar for paying with my debit card. Just and FYI for those not paying cash. I wasn't told and only asked due to my total being way over the standard 7% tax. Overall I'd say not a horrible product just overpriced. Don't think I'll be ordering again.",

I've had their honey BBQ wings (anazingggg!), a chicken fries cheese and wing sauce bowl (sounds weird, but is pretty exceptional) and hot pepper cheese balls. I haven't been disappointed yet. Their wings stayed crispy even tho they were drenched in sauce & they definitely didn't go light on the sauce which I like! Hot pepper cheese balls are also amazing, I don't find them in many places and I thoroughly adore them! Also this place has 51 wing sauces including some you won't find a ton of places, a few sirracha flavored ones, jalapeno ranch, and that's just naming a few. You can eat here although I believe take out is far more common.  The only main complaint I have is the ranch dressing, I love ranch and I'm kinda picky about it. Their ranch has decent flavor but is rather runny. All in all not a bad place to get some bar food/game food. After all, it is football season!",

I've had the steak salad, which is enough for one person and then some, and loaded with fresh toppings--sometimes with too much raw onion.  The steak is really shaved steak (think: Steak Ums).  I tried the breaded chicken instead with a sauce on it.  I will warn you that the sauce sinks to the bottom and your lettuce wilts, so tread lightly with the sauces.  We've had wings on numerous occasions.  I really like the Honey Old Bay (just as it sounds), Sweet & Hot (honey or brown sugar and hot sauce), and the honey garlic--seeing a theme here?  I do like their dry seasonings because they cook their wings very well, which is my preference.  My husband always orders sandwiches--usually the Philly Steak, which he likes.  Unfortunately, we lived in Philadelphia for years, so this would not compete with them, but it will do for Pittsburgh :)  The onion rings are huge and beer battered and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.  Do note, they delivery--an usually faster than the time the predict.  So we enjoy this place: it's close, good on the wallet, and has some unique and decent choices.",

    "text": "51 Wings sits on Route 51, an area that is experiencing a slow renaissance after years of underdevelopment.   51 Wings' name also refers to the 51 (!) varieties of chicken wings they offer. That they sell no pizza whatsoever is enough to make them a refreshing addition to this long-neglected South Hills corridor.   As we walked in to the grey-walled storefront, we were greeted by a bubbly blonde who was eager to serve us and was tickled to know that we only came because our first choice, Edgar's Authentic Mexican, is closed on Mondays.   Their wings come in oddball quantities of 6,13, 26,and...51! Without much thought, we requested 13 of the Old Bay Ranch flavor and were surprised to get a bowl full of crispy clucker parts that were covered in actual ranch dressing (as opposed to having it served on the side) and dusted with Old Bay after the fact.   A scrumptious mess it was, the chicken remaining brittle and moist despite the nigh-overload of creamy white mother sauce, the aforementioned spice given just enough room to kick me in the tongue.  Kay had a Bowl of the Breaded Chicken persuasion with honey mustard. her meal came in a wooden salad bowl and included fries, mozzarella, a wing sauce and her choice of meat. I had to finish it for her, and found it to be a not-quite-fully-realized type of poutine, not that it tried to be, which is what made this jumble of ideal shoestring fries, tender poultry nuggets, and cheese intriguing and perhaps...accidental?   My Bacon Cheeseburger was doughy, moist, gooey, and rich and tasty all around, the meaty, smoky, severely savory bacon stealing the show from a patty I wished was medium-rare instead of well-done.   From there, we bid the gracious staff adieu and headed towards Sugar & Spice for dessert.   Based on our visit, it would seem that 51 Wings may have...wings, meaning that they deserve a fighting chance. Don't dismiss this part of Pittsburgh. Fly down to Area 51 and get your wing thing on.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dnzh9WEeRACE&s=586155e6c027431efd5e99523f4bd455052732ed511c63cb8882120830add1ea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=nzh9...</a>  P.S. 51 Wings delivers to Brentwood, Whitehall, Carrick, Overbrook, Brookline, Castle Shannon, Baldwin, Pleasant Hills, and parts of West Mifflin.  P.P.S. The wings we had reminded me favorably of an old recipe I found once for a \"white\" BBQ sauce, its main ingredient being mayonnaise.",

The honey jalapeno is literally honey with a jalapeno relish like substance thrown on top. Gross. And the sriracha ranch was a pool of bottle ranch dressing with sriracha drizzled on top in which my wings bathed in. They aren't very innovative so to speak. They're wings are 51 cents on wing night too which is more expensive than most places. I don't recommend.",

    "text": "Not a big fan of wings but finally stopped for the (Friday's during Lent) fish sandwich. You'll be able to make at least 2 and then some from what they give you. I wish they had it all the time. So, since the fish was good, I decided on a return visit to try the 1/2 pound cheeseburger. Surprisingly it's made from fresh unfrozen beef and was way better than what the fast food factories offer. For a 3rd visit, I tried the 1/4 pound bacon wrapped hot dog, and it was again very good. Unlike other reviewer's experiences, the fries on all 3 occasions were not very crispy by the time I got home, but they were fresh cut and more than passable.  Overall, 51 Wings serves up better (and fresher) food than you might expect after trying any or all of the numerous pizza/hoagie shops that line the Rt. 51 corridor. The staff is very friendly and accurate while delivery usually beats estimated times. This is now part of my regular rotation and I look forward to trying more items from the menu, maybe even the wings :)",

The food was hot and crisp. We ordered two 13 piece wings, one with honey garlic sauce and one with spicy garlic. The honey garlic were really good, but the garlic flavor wasn't very present. Either way, wings slathered in honey are delicious. The spicy garlic were pretty much what I expected; moderately hot with a strong garlic flavor. We really enjoyed those as well. We also ordered the beer battered onion rings, hot pepper cheese balls, fried ravioli, mac and cheese bites. All of the appetizer items were dusted with Parmesan cheese, which we loved. The beer battered onion rings were big and crisp, I really enjoyed them. I didn't try the mac and cheese bites or fried ravioli so no opinion there but my husband and son liked them. The hot cheese balls were great as well, crisp enough and the cheese was good texture. A+ overall, we will definitely be ordering again and trying new sauces.",

Both flavors that we ordered were delicious and cooked perfectly! They offer all flats or all drums (at an up charge) but at least it's an option. I also don't understand why you only get one flavor option when you purchase 6 or 13 wings? If you decide to order (2)6 piece orders, then you lose a wing AND it's more expensive????  I did not try any of the sides, just simply did the wings for takeout. I will definitely order from here again but I'm not rushing...",

When I finally bust open the goods the ranch wings had no seasoning on them at all just a few green flakes and the honey/old bay had no old bay seasoning and very little honey.

You can only get 1 flavor if you order 6 or 13 and 2 flavors if you order 26 or 51. I recommend getting a couple orders of 6 wings to try different flavors. We ordered the Cajun Ranch, Signature Hot, Dry BBQ, and Honey Jalapano. By far my favorite was the Cajun Ranch. The wings were coated in homemade ranch dressing and then dusted with Cajun seasoning. It's a great balance of heat and sweet. Signature Hot and Dry BBQ were tied for my next favorite. They had good flavoring and seasoning to both. I was not a fan of the Honey Jalapeno. The jalapenos were pickled and chopped up all over the wing, but didn't really bring enough spiciness and the Honey flavor was just off. All in all, this was a great place and I'll be coming back to try a few more flavors.",

It has parking on the side of the building so you dont have to worry about trying to pull out of the parking spot and turn to get back out on the road like you do with a lot of the other shops on 51.   Upon entering it is very underwhelming. There is definitely a lack of dining ambiance but for me the food is more important then the wall decorations.   So many different flavors of wings. I went with the sweet and hot while my husband got the blue cheese Parmesan and an order of bacon cheese tots.   While waiting i went to wash up in the restroom which was very clean. Always a good sign of a quality restaurant.   Food came out pretty quickly. While there were only two other parties there the phone rang nonstop with take out orders.   My wings were not as hot in temperature as one would expect wings fresh out of the fryer to be but that meant i didn't have to wait for them to cool. I love super saucy wings and they were super-duper saucy. The sweet hot sauce had just enough spice to bite your tongue but not so much to destroy your digestive system. Husbands blue cheese parm wings were very good as well with a really thick sauce. The bacon cheese tots had lots of cheese and bacon. This place doesn't skimp.   Look forward to trying more flavors of wings!!",

    "text": "I've ordered from 51 Wings and Things for a few years now. First when I lived in Castle Shannon and then when I bought a house in West Mifflin I was happy that I was still in their delivery range since their site says they deliver to parts of West Mifflin. Today however I was told that I live on the \"boarder\" of their delivery range and I would have to pay a $3 fee for delivery. After I explained to the girl on the phone that I had ordered and had delivery at this address before she just said sorry that's what my manage said. That's listed no where on their site. I hate silly stuff like this! So that's it for me and 51 Wings.",

    "text": "I love wings and was so thrilled to see a place that sells mostly wings, and 51 flavors of wings at that. I ordered takeout and the service was great and the food even better. My wings were still crispy when I got home and the honey jalapeno sauce was the bomb. It's exactly what you'd expect, honey with minced jalapeno; it was sweet with a medium spice level. I also very much enjoyed my side of fresh (thin) cut fries.   I absolutely love the variety of sauces here and you bet that I will be here on the regular to try all 51 sauces, but that will be hard considering how much I enjoyed the honey jalapeno!",

    "text": "Chicken wings and anything buffalo is my jam! If I can add buffalo to it, I will. Chicken wings every night? Yes please! So imagine my excitement when I moved to the area and found out I could have my Buffalo wings DELIVERED to my house! (growing up in the middle of nowhere means you didn't get delivery!)  51 Wings is better than I expected. They have so many flavors and options that it is kinda overwhelming. However every flavor I've tried has been delicious. Even better though is the size and quality of the wings! They are big and meaty, and always stay crispy and hot, even with delivery. They don't skimp on the sauce either!  My go to now is their signature hot. Just enough spice and kick and and all around delicious flavor. I've also tried hot Ranch, spicey gold parm, hot, mild, and garlic parm made hot. Every flavor is super good! I'm sure as I continue to order, I'll try more flavors.  Delivery is usually within the said time and every person I've talked to or delivered has been very nice!  51Wings are what a chicken wing lovers dreams are made of!",

I love chicken but I felt like I was searching for the good meat. I now have a sore throat and don't think I'll order from them again. I'll get my wings from a pizza place. Maybe I'll enjoy wings again",

The fries are fresh cuts and are really good. The cheese sticks are excellent as well. Chicken wings took about 20 min and the were extra crispy and full of flavors.  Prices are very good. Definitely will return soon.",

The sauces are usually pretty good however I'd avoid some.  I once ordered peppercorn ranch and it was literally ranch covered wings with peppercorns on them.  However I am usually very pleased with the sauces.  The regular Buffalo and wet Cajun are my two favorites.",

    "text": "This was my first time trying 51 Wings. They have a big menu but I was craving wings. The gentleman who waited on me was very nice. I ordered Garlic Butter Parm Wings, Medium Hot wings, and 2 orders of fries. I was taking the food home instead of eating there. I prefer to eat at a restaurant but I had to get home. The gentleman told me that it would be 15-20 mins. That's a good thing because it means they are cooking them fresh. Sure enough, 15 minutes later my order was ready. They smelled wonderful.  I got the wings Home and they were still hot and still crunchy. They were juicy too. There was a lot of butter on the Garlic Butter Parm Wings. A bit much for me, so I drained it all off. Also I had asked for Ranch dressing and they forgot to include it.  The fries were warm but starting to go limp. They are a smaller, thinner fry and I prefer that.  I would definitely order wings again. We really enjoyed them.",
