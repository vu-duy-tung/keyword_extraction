Expensive-mediocre food and wait staff. As it turns out a friend in Wexford asked if we could meet at the Il Pizzaiolo in Warrendale-Yikes!!!!I was ready for a similar experience but I was WRONG!!!!! The wait staff very friendly and attentive - the salad crisp - and rather than expounding on how pizza could be cooked in 90 seconds (but be delivered to the table just barely warm).....a hot, crispy, lightly browned delicious pizza was delivered to the table!!!!! Somehow all of these things made the expense easier to SWALLOW!!!!!",

    "text": "This restaurant is a perfect example of a train rolling out of control. I've been going to Il Pizzaiolo for many years in Mt. Lebanon & have always enjoyed the appetizers & my meal. Over the years, the appetizers have become smaller and the prices larger. The quality has also diminished. That being said, this new location is a perfect location for an area lacking in dining choices. The food is still of fairly good quality. The prices are simply out of control. Period. When you think about the price of home made pasta that you can purchase at most Italian grocerias vs the price they are asking here, you will seriously consider making your own meal. The staff is mostly knowledgeable and friendly enough to earn their tip. My advice is to try it out, but try others as well. You will find that you will get a comparable meal for much less elsewhere. Opening new locations and sacrificing product as well as raising prices and putting out smaller portions is the way restaurants put a bad taste in consumers mouthes.",

The dining room is nicer than Warrendale I think. But I would always consider a trip out to Mount Lebanon for their awesome patio and wine bar. It doesn't look like the patio will be terrific here which is a shame. But for quality food this is your place.",

Strongly recommend the rice balls (Arancini!); you get four large tasty rice things, two kinds. We got a pizza (yums, much higher quality ingredients and combos than neighboring pizza places, but the zas are smaller). Also definitely get the lemon cake thing (Delizia al limone) - it's a very impressive looking dessert, with a light delicate cream layer inside and soft sweet icing on something that's kinda like lemon pound cake, serving 1-2. We'll count this as a standby for late-night dinner orders out.",

I walked out feeling content, and not feeling like I just got fleeced.  The wedding soup was good, has orzo rice in it.  Really enjoyed the arancini (fried rice balls).  Comes with 2 of each, one stuffed with cheese, the other with veggies on a bed of red sauce.  Got a free appetizer of marinated veggies.  These were all great, was a nice little app.  The calzone was really good.  Dough tastes fresh, homemade.  Stuffed to the gills with meats and veggies.  Was impressed by how fresh it tasted.  The osso buco was also very good.  Tender, fall apart meat with a side of cheesy risotto.  Finished with a piece of tiramisu that was so big two of us couldn't finish it, and we took half of it home.  Bottom line, you know going in that you aren't paying value prices for an Italian meal.  But the food tastes upscale, and the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. This won't be my go-to Italian place, but I'd take family here on special occasions.",

    "text": "We were so excited to see this place going in so close to home, but it was such a disappointment!  We really thought (hoped) this would be a semi-upscale pizza place with family-friendly, modestly priced Italian offerings, but it's the opposite of that.  The menu is strange and very over priced, we would never attempt to take our kids here (not like we'll be back anyways)!    Short version:   I wish there was a zero-star option, I get nervous just driving by this place now. Don't ever go here.    Long version:  Upon being seated by the less-than-friendly three-person hosting team, who seemed more eager to flirt with one another than perform their duties, we were impressed by the decor and atmosphere, our hopes were high.  Unfortunately they were dimmed quickly when our waitress appeared and it became clear that this was going to be a strange meal. Her demeanor was almost off-putting and it seemed as though she had not only never waited a table in her life, but also had never been to a restaurant before, let alone a high-end place like this.  It was kind of creepy to be honest.   My wife requested iced tea, something every restaurant in this area offers from McDonalds to Morton's. Our waitress who appeared to have never interacted with another human before, strangely asked my wife to clarify what type of tea she'd like, suggesting three italian-named options that we didn't understand, you know, cause we don't speak italian.  My wife repeated the request for simple unsweetened iced tea.  The \"waitress\" was baffled and again repeated the three foreign-sounding options from which my wife randomly chose one, for no other reason than to end the bizarre conversation.  I ordered ice water.  Eight minutes later our server returned with a bottle of italian fruit-flavored tea in a glass bottle (like you'd get in a convenience store) and a small cup, and a carafe of warm tap water and small cup for me.  No ice.  My wife had to open her $8 italian convenience store tea and pour it into a scotch glass and I had to serve myself the water.  Not a big deal, I'm not a snob, but for these prices, this was not expected at all. Better service can readily be found at Applebees.  The iced tea was disgusting. My wife can be picky with such things but I am not, so i gave it a try.  Nothing short of gross.    The service was extremely bizarre throughout our entire meal.  At times our waitress would return to the table and not say a word, just stand there staring blankly.  After three such visits and my politely telling her we need a bit more time, I told her that my wife is lactose intolerant and that we were having trouble finding anything on the menu that should could eat. This was greeted with silence.  Not an \"I'm so sorry\" or an entree suggestion or two, nothing. It may have been the most awkward situation I've ever encountered in a restaurant.  After about 30 seconds of silence (which felt like an hour), my wife, in frustration, just ordered the spaghetti (for $19) and I ordered some sort of cheese and sausage-filled pasta dish for I believe around $28.  Half of the menu was in italian, which could be charming if done in the right way, but in this case it just made everyting impossible to decipher. I asked for italian dressing on my side-salad and was told that would be extra (I think around $6-8), to which I couldn't help but laugh out loud.  I told her to forget the salad and the server silently left the table, much to our relief, not unlike Lurch leaving the dining room of the Adam's family.  At this point I was tempted to follow the waitress and tell her to cancel our order, inform management that we were leaving and go to literally any other restaurant to eat.  But my wife was too embarrassed to do that so we stuck it out.   Approximately 15 minutes later Strangest Waitress Ever appeared with our food. My wife's $18 spaghetti was about 1/16 pound of cooked pasta drowning in a bowl of watery marinara that looked like it was dumped straight out of a tin can that had spent 10 years in a fallout shelter.  It was laughable.  The one lone positive of the evening was that my food was fairly tasty.  No where near worth $28 for such a small serving (maybe 10-12 tortellini), but it was good.  My wifes meal I wouldn't pay a penny for. She forced herself to consume half of it before she called it quits.  While we \"dined\", we got a kick out of the 20-something cook and waitress pairing that were flirting so heavily behind the glass windows fronting the wood-fired pizza oven and prep area, that we bet each other on how long it'd be before they hopped up on the counter and started going at it.  It would have been mortifying if not so entertaining.  I considered informing the manager of this display but he looked to be about 14 years old.  Also, forgot to add, no bread at the table.  A ~$60 meal and essentially we got a gross bottle of tea, half a serving of sausage tortellini and some gross spaghetti. I wouldn't send my worst enemy here",

I got the Parmigiana Melanzane per a recommendation from our server. I had high hopes but It was awful. Definitely over cooked, soggy, borderline slimy. The eggplant didn't seem fresh and for $22 I wish it had come with some type of pasta so at least I had something to eat.   My boyfriend had the wedding soup which was good, and the Ragu Napoletano with some spice added to it. His main dish was fantastic. The pasta was cooked well, the flavors of the meat and ragu were delicious. I wish I had followed suit and got what he had. We will definitely be back, but I do not recommend any of the Eggplant dishes.",

    "text": "A group of three of us ordered calamari, a pizza salsicce and a pasta (Paglia E Fieno) to share.  The calamari was thinly battered, crispy, and tender. Yet it was missing a component of flavor and seasoning. They also only served the \"rings\" and none of the mini tentacles. Pale and a bit disappointing.  The pizza had a delicious flavor and the crust is soft and airy. However, the crust holding the toppings are so thin that the sauce seeps through the thinnest part that the texture is off putting when you put it in your mouth.   The pasta probably was the best of the three. The presentation is very nice and the cream sauce is delicious.   I might come back to try another pasta dish or to try the clams that were sold out early in the evening.   Overall, a bit expensive ($54 + tax&tip) but the service is good and some of the dishes here might be worth the price.",

As for the pasta, for $22 I expect my cavatelli rapini to be memorable. And not because it was so meh.  For a wonderful Italian dinner, in a lovelier space, drive a few more miles to Alta Via for their absolutely fabulous tortelli.  Il Pizzaiolo, Harts Run Road, seems to be skating by on the favorable reviews of it's other locations.",

    "text": "Everything there is overpriced, basically twice what it should cost.  $18 for a calzone with no side, or anything else?  It should be $9.    $28 for Linguine?  I'm not sure how they justify these prices.  We came with 8 people, and they put us at a 6 seat table.  Instead of moving another table over, they just put cramped us into the 6 seat table.  They don't refill your water glass, they just put a bottle of water on the table, and when that's all used up, guess what?  They don't bring over more water.  Look, if you're going to charge this much for food, and include the gratuity, the bare minimum you can do is give us water.  The windows should be tinted, they're way to bright making it hard to see the people across the table in contrast to the bright light behind them.  And the handicap parking space is not next to the front door.  Why even bother having a handicap parking space if you're going to put regular parking closer to the door than handicap parking?  I ordered a calzone from the pizza section of the menu and they didn't bring me a pizza, they brought me a calzone.  I'm not sure why they put a calzone in the pizza section if it's not a pizza.  Okay, now for some positives.  There's nothing wrong with the food it's self, it tasted like average pizza, salad, and calzone.  Everything was clean, the tables and chairs, and everything was clearly built of high quality materials.  And even though the wait staff didn't refill out water, there was no problems other than that, they were friendly.  And it was someone's birthday and they gave them a desert for free.  Really my main complaint is the price.  That $22 Stracciatella pizza, and that $22 Salumiera Pizza.  No those are not a family size pizza, they are not 16 or 18 inches.  Nope they are 10 inch pizza for $22 plus tax and tip.  If you get a drink, you could easily end up paying $60 for 2 people to have a lunch.",

Lebanon, and it's second in Warrendale (which was highly upscaled from the first) -- but in an even nicer atmosphere than the previous two. There's a beautiful patio outside, and the inside is also wonderfully decorated (past the bar; the bar is maybe the most mundane room, but still ok).  Yes, the pizza is expensive comparative to Domino's or Pizza Hut, etc., but they're serving their best attempt at authentic Italian pizza; they're not trying to feed a family of four with take-out on a budget.   I don't even recommend you do take-out, because this restaurant is about authenticity and atmosphere, along with great taste, not being economical. It's for a special treat, not for a hum-drum Friday night.  As long as you go understanding this, I think you'll be satisfied and eager to return.",
