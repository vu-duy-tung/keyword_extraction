Everything was so delicious, service was prompt and attentive, free wifi, comfy hang out area by the bar, amazing artwork and very inexpensive for the quality of food served.  There is parking across the street.  The desserts are just evil. They are so scrumptious you will want to try everything! The coffee Budino is to die for!   I really like the wine dispenser too, you can buy a reload able card and serve yourself!  Franco has some excellent wines to try.  I will definitely return!",

    "text": "Short Version: this place mess up pork belly. If you are a True foodie, you know what that means.  Long Version: We had to much high hope for Senti. From the online articles, reviews to friends' recommendations, we thought this would be another hit spot for us foodies in PIttsburgh. Unfortunately, it was not. While the ambience was nice and I can see the owner's visions in the settings, the food was very disappointing. First, it was not well plated: no art on the plate here :/. Second and most importantly, the food was very underwhelming. My first dish was pork belly with grilled polenta. The pork belly was clearly reheated multiple times and completed dried out and over cooked. It was chewy and hard to eat. I was impressed how much they can mess up a pork belly dish. The grill polenta was along the same scale, very dry due to multiple reheating cycles. For entree, I got their salmon dish. The salmon was good, but nothing special. They re-use the same grill polenta from the appetizer in this dish. It did not go well with the salmon, and again the polenta was very dry and clearly reheated and not made fresh. Lastly, the presentation might be one of the worse I have seen. It reminded me plates from a local diner at 11pm. Overall, for the price of the food, I definitely would not recommend this restaurant. Try Cure down the street or Spoon in  east liberty. There are so many good restaurants in the city at this or a lower price level.",

I had the fried eggplant dish and it was delicious and my friends really enjoyed the lasagna. My other friends tried the gnocchi and were not happy with it though. I also really enjoyed the mixed salad... Balsamic vinaigrette dressing was delicious. Not giving it a full 5 stars because of how nasty the gnocchis were (and I mean it's an Italian restaurant so there really isn't any excuse).   Would definitely recommend, but just be careful when choosing your entree since there seems to be some inconsistency.",

One member of our party arrived at 5:10 and was told she couldn't be seated until the entire party arrived. Really? You couldn't seat one person out of a party of three until everyone was there? Senti is not the only restaurant that does this and it's very customer unfriendly. But it gets better. We arrive, order a drink at the bar (that's where she waited) and told the host we were all present and would like to go to our table. He takes us to our table, which is only set for two people. Seeing this, he takes us back to the waiting area until they set another place. Shouldn't this have been taken care of while you made the first arrival wait? And why didn't you seat us at one of the other tables that were already set? There were only three other parties in the restaurant at the time, so there were plenty of other tables available. As for the food, it was fine. My grilled radicchio wasn't plated very well, but it was quite good. My duck however was not that good. Quite gamey. Our server was warm and efficient. She also knew the wine list and was able to knowledgeably discuss the wines. So, overall it was a reasonable meal, though we've had better there. But the beginning was not acceptable.",

We were treated like queens and their food was to die for...From the perfectly cooked duck to scrumptious squid ink pasta to the delicious vanilla pudding and donut holes.  The sommeliar was knowledgeable and a perfect fine dining professional.  He recommended the perfect wine for our palettes and did not once allowed us to pour our own wine (as should be!).

You could wear a dress or nice jeans if you wanted. The prices are reasonable for the area it's located in and for how nice it is on the inside. Entrees ranged from $18-$25. The only thing negative I would say is it seemed like a smaller menu with maybe 6 entrees to pick from. Although sometimes I find it nice to not have so many choices. Overall I would definitely go back. For $43 plus tip I got a salad, entree, glass of wine, and dessert.",

I liked that they had interesting cocktail specials (all involving blood orange flavor the night we visited).  The pasta was definitely good, but not great, which some 5-star reviews have suggested.  It's not like eating in Italy, but the recipes have interesting twists.  Recommend the tagliatelli puttanesca which was soft, rich, and delivered the right level of puttanesca spiciness.  Desserts were similarly good.  What I liked most about this restaurant was the value of a gourmet experience and the laid back atmosphere.  It's classy, but not stuffy.  One feels welcome to linger and enjoy the whole meal.",

The duck entree arrived, and the skin was barely cooked and the meat was from rare to well done.  The waiter was helpful, took it back, and asked for another duck entree.  This time, the duck arrived and the skin was a tiny bit crispier, but the duck breast itself was nearly raw.  The waiter gave us a complimentary dessert - an apple tort with the worlds smallest scoop of cinnamon ice cream.  I've had better tasting Hostess Apple Pies!

Very well made and the service was tremendous.  The entire staff was top notch. I have to mention the bread, the focaccia bread. I was worried about having enough room for my meal because the bread just melted in your mouth. I ended up going with the duck as my main entree.  Probably the best duck that I've ever eaten. It was cooked perfectly and a portion size was spot-on. My girlfriend and I finished off the meal by splitting a Tiramisu and a couple of cocktail drinks. I've had a lot of tiramisu through the years and this was by far the best Tiramisu I've ever eaten.  The owner Franco stopped by our table, while at most restaurants managers and/or owners kind of just do the hey how you doing how is everything, Franco seemed to really care about experience and our meal and that we were satisfied. I highly recommend Senti if you are looking for great service and great meal and a great experience.",

The lamb and the scallops were cooked perfectly, but again the dish was just fine, nothing memorable about it. The descriptions for all of the dishes sounded much more impressive than the actual meal.  The one thing I did like quite a lot was the dessert. We got the tiramisu and the nutella mousse. Both were delicious! So if you go, definitely leave room for dessert.   We ate inside, but the outdoor patio looks quite nice. And they seem to have a happy hour deal during the week that a drink comes with a free antipasta.  The space is large, and actually felt very un-pittsburgh to me, but I couldn't place why.",

Large windows, clean modern interiors, white wall and modern art. The waitress was very knowledgeable and answered all our questions and took our dietary considerations into mind.  When we had called, we did mention the restaurant week menu, which was a pretty simple menu: salads, entree and dessert. There were no options between them except that we could replace the kind of meat in the entree. What was not impressive was that they took forever to get our dishes to come out. Almost 30 minutes for the salad !?! Then another 20 for the entree. And the dessert took some time to come out too. Most of us were not pleased that the service was this slow, considering there were hardly any other customers in the restaurant. That being said, the food was on the impressive scale. Our salad consisted of carrots, oranges and candied pecans, and was delightful. The Farro con Scelta was good too , nothing to call out. I was looking forward to the tiramisu, but was disappointed. The restaurant week tiramisu was a much smaller version of the regular one, with much more cream, and less cake. A friend got the regular sized version and I could see the difference between the 2. Overall, this place has really good potential to up their game, and make the experience better.",

Some contemporary Italian music would have been great. I would definitely return.",

    "text": "So, we thought we would be here for a drink or two and dinner, and it ended up being an EVENT.  I don't even know where to begin.  The sommelier was so extremely helpful in navigating us to the correct wines for our taste and mood, and when we hadn't yet hit \"the mark\" on the wine of the evening, she continued to put forth excellent choices. At one point, the manager assisted us with even more insight.   As for food, we were welcomed with marinated olives and decided upon two dishes for appetizers: the scallops and the mushrooms, both of which were exquisite, particularly the scallops which were perfectly seared.  Our entrees were the steak and pork tenderloin. Here's where we had a bit of a complaint. The steak was AMAZING. Medium rare to a T! Beautifully seasoned and a texture that melted in my mouth, then pair the wine with it and BAM! WOW! The pork was another story. In fact, we questioned if it was the same chef who cooked the steak. Pork tenderloin medallions over a bed of white beans and chorizo and pearl onions. The tenderloin was overdone and dry, and there were supposed to be figs in the bed. There were three slices of figs. This dish wasn't even in the same ballpark as the steak.   I would comment on the dessert, but we opted for bubbles. Quite a lovely selection of prosecco and brut, we landed on a brut rose that closed out our evening. My goodness, what an evening.   It was an absolute pleasure to chat with the sommelier and the owner, and I sincerely look forward to dining here again.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Friday night for dinner with my wife and another couple.  We had reservations for 7:15 and arrived around that time to be immediately seated.  The inside of Sentis is quite interesting and modern.  They have a nice lounge type area with a bar and then a number of tables behind that.  There is also another room that it looked like they were using for a rehearsal dinner the night that we were there and so we didn't really get to see it.  My wife and I decided to start off our meal by splitting the fritto misto.  It consisted of fried carrots, zucchini, peppers, calamari and shrimp and was quite good.  The breading on it was rather light yet crispy and everything was seasoned perfectly.  I was especially impressed that the calamari was tender as most places tend to over cook it and make it rubbery.  Then for my dinner entree I went with one of the specials for the evening which was lamb t-bones.  It consisted of 3 lamb medallions over top of some gnocchi, peas and mushrooms and had some dollops of pureed carrots and a smearing of black garlic on the plate.  The lamb was cooked perfectly and tasted pretty good.  Senti let the flavor of the lamb come through and didn't try to hide it.  The gnocchi was also decent although I think that they were a little denser than i would have liked.  I did enjoy the flavor produced by dragging them through the black garlic though.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Everything that we had was pretty tasty and I enjoyed the atmosphere.",

When I walked into the restaurant, I was immediately surprised by the decor- floor to ceiling windows, white furnishings, exposed duct work. The appearance of the restaurant is very clean and modern. After looking over the extensive wine list (wow!), I went with a wine I was familiar with while hubs asked the waitress for her opinion. We were both very pleased with our selections.   Our waitress was knowledgable about the menu and was able to answer questions regarding my current dietary restrictions. I started my meal with the mixed salad. Great start, good size tasty dressing. The accompanying bread was also delicious. For my main course, I decided on the pork medallions which were accompanied by grilled radicchio, white beans and sausage. The pork and the sausage were both cooked perfectly and very flavorful. The beans were a miss for me as I would have preferred a pasta (gnocchi). Service did seem to be backed up most likely due to a large party that was receiving their food before we received ours. Overall, I enjoyed my meal and will certainly be back.",

It was served with sun dried tomato risotto and mixed veggies. It was amazing. Bravo! Then I treated myself to a piece of tiramisu. It was obviously homemade in house and delicious.

I also love Edison bulbs reclaimed wood and that industrial ambience that every single recent location has.  That being said from the moment you walk in Senti you realize it is different.  It's bright.  It's authentic.  It has a warm Italian welcome of the sincere and genuine owner.   The menu is legit and is a True taste of Italy with fresh ingredients and home made pastas. The wine list is superb.  The service and setting is great.    Try the burrata appetizer, the lasagna and the tiramisu.

When we arrived a few minutes early, we were told that our table wasn't ready. No big deal... until we waited 45 minutes until we were shoved into a table that was too small for our party because the table still was not ready. For some reason, the manager and wait staff refused to tell the party that there was a reservation behind them. The manager apologized and stated they would \"do something special\" for us. Once we were seated 45 minutes late, we waited ANOTHER 50 minutes in between our appetizer and entree courses. No apology given whatsoever at that point. Three of us god filets, all of which were over cooked and poor cuts. When one of us informed our waitress that the steaks were over cooked, she looked at us like we were inconveniencing her by telling her this. By the time that the check came, we had been in the restaurant for THREE HOURS. Would you think there would be a massive discount on the check, especially given what the manager said? Yep, so did we. What happened? We got $10 off of each filet, seemingly only to do with them being over cooked. No money off whatsoever for how long we waited. I was warned to not try this restaurant and I absolutely wish that I never had. They completely ruined all of the plans that we had for Mother's Day.",

I should have stopped there and enjoyed the Super Tuscan wine the server recommended. For the second course I chose what I hoped would be a light vegetarian entree, \"Zucca Fritta - Lightly Battered Cardamom Spiced Kabocha Squash and Eggplant Served with Butternut Squash, Wheat Berries, Daikon and Watermelon Radish Slaw.\" You can judge from the picture but it was anything but lightly battered. More like a State Fair style deep fried vegetable. And not at all healthy.  Service was just OK too. Had to pour our own wine after the first glass. Dinner for 4 people with one bottle of ($52) wine came to $222 before tip. Nice setting but not sure if we will be back.",

The pasta was just a bit dry, so we asked olive oil on the side and ravioli was in a broth, which added an interesting flavor profile to the sweet squash filling - maybe a more hearty filing would be better in the future, as the filling was coming out into the broth, leaving just ravioli pasta. Some of the other tables had protein courses that came out, which looked really good.

Salad lacking anything which would make it worth the price, steak the same.  Trying hard to be an \"upmarket\" restaurant but lacking a lot of the finish and style that would make it so. Forgot, they had no sugar.  Bit of a worry when a restaurant is out of sugar. Very presumptive to have your 20% already on the check .Will never return.",

Our waiter really seemed more like we were bothering him- as did the rest of the wait staff. We didn't get first course of salad until 8:10, entrees came at 8:50.  I got the gnocchi as did 5 other people at our table and we all thought it was a little less than so-so- though other people did seem to enjoy their food(specifically eggplant and lasagna). Which is why I gave this 2 stars and not one.  At 9:20 we all started asking for checks....which took another 20 min. The first person left the marathon dinner at 9:50.  I don't know if it was because we were a big group (12) or the service is just that bad. I can't say I'll never go back- but I won't be back unless it's for a special event or someone else really insists on going there....",

I have lived in other cities with a great foodie scene, and I travel a fair amount for work, so I am fortunate to try different excellent restaurants.  Senti is an absolute gem. They provide upscale Italian cuisine in a simple , light filled modern space. However, there is not a stuffy feel to the place. The owners set a positive tone for the restaurant: they are warm, professional, and are actively involved in the daily operations of the restaurant. The food is excellent in both quality of ingredients and presentation. The staff are knowledgeable and efficient but down to earth. I admit that I am at Senti at least once weekly and it has become one of my \"go to\" restaurants (along with Morcilla) for a wonderful meal (dine in, at the bar, or to go) in Lawrenceville!",

    "text": "A dinner date location for this past Saturday, my girlfriend and I checked out Senti on Butler Street. An okay overall experience but things just seemed to be lacking experience-wise.   Location:  Positioned on the main artery in Lawrenceville, Butler Street sees a fair amount of traffic but Senti does have some parking spots directly across the street in a small lot. Signage could be larger and clearer here as one could mistake this lot for a restricted area.   Atmosphere:  Upon entering, you will pass through grocery store style automatic stores which my date and I found odd. They are horizontal sliding doors but have the \"caution\" signage on the center and just set the wrong vibe upon entering. A normal glass door would've sufficed.   Entering the restaurant itself there is a fairly large bar in front and to the right with modern decor. For some reason it just reminded me too much of an airport bar.   The restaurant was just too small in my opinion which didn't allow you to really become enveloped in the experience, it felt like we were eating in a medium sized meeting room. Note there is seating outside. The modern decor theme continued throughout which was nice, but I noticed a button missing from the white leather bench and Command Brand-style hooks hanging from the ceiling seemingly for added decor or events. Something just struck me as off for a date-night ambiance dinner.  Service: The service didn't miss however. Our hostess, runner and waitress were all very professional and well timed.  Food: Pork Belly: Slightly dry for being a fattier selection of protein. I would have liked to see more rendered fat and moisture. Paired fig was too soft/overcooked  Duck: I have enjoyed better duck as the fat cap here also could've been rendered a touch more which left some chewy segments. Dish also seemed somewhat cool when served. Fried kale was pleasant although could've served less on the plate.  Blueberry Torta: Predictable unfortunately, the crust was a bit too dry for my liking. My date's off-menu buttercake was more satisfying.   Drink: Tequila, aperol, grapefruit, sage: Packed the right punch and was nicely balanced",

That being said, my experience at Senti was totally fine. While I was not blown away, I do see potential.  It's a beautiful space, they've really made it a swanky restaurant. It's pretty big too. there's a decent size bar/lounge area and dining room. It's all decked out in white colors, you kinda feel like you're in Miami, except now it's the dead of winter and anything but.  We had very friendly and attentive service. Our bread basket came promptly, as did all our drinks and food. While my negroni was good, I felt it was a little heavy on the compari and not enough gin.   My main dish was the swordfish and gnocchi. It was plated beautifully. I'd say my fish was very good and I loved the crispy skin, the gnocchi and sauce fell a little flat. I feel as if there could have been a little more flavor to the dish.   I was very impressed with the tiramisu. It looks liked it had been freshly made and then sliced from a big pan (a generous slice at that) and it was very good. I like tiramisu when it's more cakey, and that's what this was.   I'm interested in coming back and checking out there wine selection and seeing how they progress and time goes by!",

The hostess made us feel welcome even though we did not have a reservation and arranged a table for us in a nice location.  Justin our server and Zach who filled waters and boxed leftovers for us were also very nice and attentive.  We had the pureed vegetable soup with Italian ham (can't spell it) was light and refreshing without being over-salted as is the case with some establishments.  My son had the scallop app and I had the stuffed squash flowers both tasty and well prepared.  We also ordered lasagna and 1/2 chicken which we also liked very much.  Want to try the bronzino next time and also the tiramisu that everyone raves so much about.  This restaurant is an excellent place for family, friends, or a romantic date night.  Looking forward to another delicious meal soon.",

It was our second stop on the tour and my friends and I were so impressed, we made reservations for dinner on our way out the door from the tasting.   During the tour, we sampled a small tasting of their gnocchi. Though it was the smallest of all the tastings we had during the tour, it was one of the best. Handmade gnocchi really stands out. I've had it many places and this was one of the best I have tasted. During the tour, the owner also came out to talk to us and tell us about the restaurant and the food. (He explained the secret behind good gnocchi, too!). I found this to be a very nice touch. He noted their automated wine dispenser, which we were all impressed by and wanted to give a try.  Our dinner was lovely. The owner remembered us from the tour and took very good care of us. I tried their lemon burrata ravioli which was incredibly delicious. I also had the salmon which was not only a generous portion but also one the best salmon dishes I have tasted at a restaurant in a long time. We did try the automated wine dispenser and found it to be an added bit of fun to our night there.  I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for authentic Italian food, handmade pasta, and/or good wine.",

    "text": "Underwhelming.  Came here for Restaurant Week with a group of 7 other friends. When we walked in, it felt like we were going to get a treat. The dining room is bright and fancy and at the time, was filled with many other guests who seemed to be enjoying themselves. The service was friendly albeit a bit haphazard (e.g., forgetting my drink, not being able to get their attention, etc.).  I ended up going off the regular menu because aside from the entree, the dishes on the restaurant week menu didn't appeal to me.  I decided to go with two appetizers: a seared scallop dish and a pork belly dish.  The scallops were seared nicely and well-seasoned. I think they must be working out what they want to put on this dish because the complements were not the ones listed on the menu and didn't quite work for me -- the mushrooms were a bit overcooked and limp, and I (and this is an unpopular opinion) am not a fan of sweet potato but also it did not seem well-cooked. Overall I was ok with this dish.  The pork belly was utterly disappointing. It tasted almost like it had been freezer-burned and was tough rather than tender. It came with polenta that was listed as grilled but was actually fried and it tasted alright but dried out and did not add much to the dish.  I got the Budino al Cafe for dessert. The glazed donut holes were fine though barely glazed, and the coffee pudding was flavorful though was a bit... spongier(?) than I've had for a budino. Maybe this is the style but it was difficult to see how the donut holes would be eaten with this. Also, again, overall ok.  The rest of the table also seemed unimpressed by the meal. Pretty much everything was either not great or only ok. (The osso bucco off the Restaurant Week menu seemed to be one of the better dishes.) Unfortunately (or fortunately?), with the multitude of great restaurants in Pittsburgh, there isn't a reason for me to return.",

While some other restaurants will sneer at you or act dismissive if you don't want dinner, Senti has consistently accommodated us and gone further, with excellent service that makes clear how much they value every customer. While we didn't ask this visit, in the past the in-house wine expert (she said she was not a sommelier) has generously spent time helping us explore the wine list, whether we were having dinner or just stopping in for dessert.

The decor and seating is beautiful, and comfortable, and the staff could not have been more friendly!    We both ordered a great glass of wine, which was accompanied by some amazing housemade foccacia.  Yep...we asked for more of that.  We decided to stick with the classics and ordered the gnocchi with beef ragu, and spaghetti pomodoro, with a side of broccolini to share.  Both dishes were delicious, the pasta was prepared al dente to perfection and that pomodoro sauce....welll....thankfully we had enough foccacia that none of it went to waste!   We pushed the envelope a little and decided to try our hand at the desserts.   We had the chocolate bread pudding and while it was good, but not anything to write home (or yelp) about.

    "text": "My first time at Senti. I had heard great things so I needed to try for myself.  I was not disappointed.  First its important to note the description on their website, \"authentic Italian food, traditional European service, and modern wining and dining.\"  What stood out to me was the \"traditional European service.\"  Translated, that means sloooow.  Please dont go to Senti if you are in a hurry or have to be somewhere by a specific time.  My wife and I were seated for 2 1/2 hours!  We knew that going in and were perfectly fine taking our time to enjoy the experience.  The spacing of the food delivery allows you to eat slowly and savor the flavors while enjoying your wine.  That's exactly what we did.    We started off with the cheese plate.  There were 3 cheeses with some crostini, apple & pear slices, a very yummy mostarda and a pool of honey on the bottom of the plate.  I couldnt tell you what the cheeses were but there was something like provolone, a soft white cheese and a blue cheese.  It was perfect all around from flavors to sizes to pairings.   We skipped salads and pastas and went straight to entrees.  I got the salmon off the menu and my wife got the special wahoo fish.  We also got a side of brocollini.  Ive never had salmon cooked so perfectly or with such flavor (from the honey mustard and dill sauce).  My wife thoroughly enjoyed her wahoo which came on a bed of farro and spinach.   Even the brocollini, which were sauteed with garlic, were cooked to perfection with tons of flavor.  For dessert, my wife's tiramisu was probably the best tiramisu Ive ever had.  I got the Torta della Stagione which was an apple pie that day, with a side of cinnamon ice cream.  The crust on the pie was unbelievable and the ice cream, the perfect complement.    I will definitely return and would recommemd trying here at least once.  The only negative was the near $200 bill for two of us but it was well worth it.",

Service was excellent, and it was the same waitress who severely disappointed us the last time. Now if they would put some California Chardonnay on the wine list they might warrant five stars. I get the point of offering only Italian wines in an Italian restaurant, but the food world should stop being politically correct and come out and admit that Italian whites range from poor to absolutely undrinkable. The reds, of course, compensate, so why not just admit it.",

Perhaps this was an off-night but it left me disappointed and wanting to never return; the brussel sprouts had no seasoning (no salt at all), the \"valentine's day\" appetizer was pathetic, and worst of all were the meatballs. I assume the brussel sprouts were par-boiled and tossed in lardons until lightly charred. $9 for these sprouts is offensive to say, the least. The appetizer was meant to be a modern take on an Italian charcuterie board with 3 dippings sauce: one was tasty, one was lazy, and one was convoluted. The sauce that stumped me was a mixture of dark chocolate and grain mustard -- my taste buds never knew what to make of it. Finally, the meatballs and accompanying sauce were akin to a can of Chef Boyardee. The meatballs were overcooked golf balls that couldn't have been more than ground beef and a teaspoon of pepper. The sauce was a punch sweetness that lacked any component of traditional Italian cooking: oregano, basil, red pepper flakes, etc.   I made a reservation here because I read and heard phenomenal reviews. This experience wasn't all-for-not, I, at the least, can check this restaurant off my checklist and never return to it.",

    "text": "Went out for a birthday celebration at Senti. The food was an overall 3 stars however the service was well below average and is why I am rating Senti a 2. We had the mushroom pasta, the seafood spaghetti, ravioli, and ragu. The octopus and beet salad were good. But the stuffed calamari was fishy-I would recommend passing on this dish. The seafood pasta was also watery-the sauce too thin and lacked flavor. They were out of the gnocchi. Why not make more? It was only 6pm.   The service was disappointing and below the level that you expect for a restaurant in this price range. The woman who greeted us from the bar was not friendly. Our waitress seemed untrained and was asking when we wanted our courses brought out.   She was also not knowledgeable about the wine selection and did not check in us after dropping our entrees regarding our food or drink. Was this because we were a large party and her tip was already factored in? She seemed more concerned with providing her friends at the table next to us a wine tasting.   We may come back but Senti will not be high our list. Many other great options for Italian throughout the city.",

Most reviews are correct in that the place does feel a bit like a hotel lobby, but to its defense it does feel like a swanky NYC sushi restaurant, which I was totally comfortable with.  The menu looked interesting, but it was the specials that sung to us during our visit. Ordering the Bronzino and the salmon, we also wanted to try a mix side dishes: the bread pudding and fried polenta. We were both pleasantly surprised by both but were quickly distracted with dessert.  The best part of our meal was absolutely the tiramisu. It's honestly the only part I remember because I remember thinking it was the perfect balance of having a coffee flavor with chocolate.  I probably won't go back, except for maybe a glass of wine and more tiramisu!",

    "text": "I visited Senti last night for dinner. Before I go to any restaurant, I review photos and read reviews so I know what to expect. I had high expectations since I saw relatively good reviews on service and food quality. However, after my experience last night I would not recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a high standard of food quality. I ordered the breaded chicken breast. It was paired with carrots and a arugula salad. Let's just say, you could have made this meal at home. I received two pieces of breaded chicken strips (yes, similar to Burger King chicken strips), chopped baby carrots, and plain arugula with a light dressing. Chicken was greasy and it was visible on the plate. I give this restaurant one star because the service was good! Our waiter was friendly.    Very disappointed! Total bill was $90 for two entries and two glasses of wine. Would love to have my money back as the food quality was that poor!   I love Lawrenceville and Butler Street, but I would not recommend this restaurant!",

Pasta ragu and salmon were well done. The porchetta benedict, though flavorful, was more like  shredded pork and it was dry.  Desserts were ok, but a bit sweet.   Unfortunately, the service was painfully slow. It was a prix fixe menu, but they did not have their act together.  What I found inexcusable was when they subbed out salmon for branzino without asking. Sure, the dish was prepared well, but at this price point, once expects the courtesy of being asked. Cannot recommend this restaurant.",

    "text": "Well the girls and I decided to go to Senti to have a little \"Dames who Dine\" situation going on.  First: They checked out coats (in the dead of winter) which was nice, the owner took us to our seats and pulled the chairs out for us. Our waitress comes over and says \"oh my god! I love your glasses\". So we were off to a pretty great start.   We asked what her favorite cocktail was and she said \"Towering Inferno\" (i think that was the name). So two of us got that, the other two ordered elderflower/rosemary/prosecco drink.  She brought us a nice sized plate of bread and butter which we wolfed down in a hurry. We discussed and decided to start off with a cheese plate (if there is one thing I love it's a good cheese plate) and a meat plate that came with some pickled veggies. So we put that order in. Perused the menu a bit more and threw in our entree orders. We also decided on splitting a bottle of wine (we opted for the $40 bottle instead of the $115).  Our cheese and meat plates came. No one let us know what the cheese were, but that was alright. The meat plate wasn't described too well on the menu so we were left guessing as to what things were. (Meat #1: Fancy bologna, #2: proscuitto, #3 what looked and tasted like capicola, #4 shaved beef jerky, there were some quick pickled carrot squars and some pickled onion and cauliflower (i think).) The cheese was a blue cheese, a brie, and a harder white cheese served with strawberries, some raisin/fig jam thing, grapes, and a two triangles of toasted bread. I'm not going to lie. I was really disappointed in the cheese plate (which the listed price was just market price) and the meat plate (though plentiful) was a bit disappointing too (especially for $30!). The waitress brought us some more bread, what I can i say i love a good bread and butter situation. Those that ordered side salads (Rucola: Arugula, Fennel, Dried Cranberries, Shaved Parmiggiano, and Lime & Fennel Dressing) received them and the salad was alright, it needed a PINCH more dressing and maybe some extra lime to cut the oil. It was decent though.  Our table ordered the following:  Filet - Served with a Horseradish Sauce, Roasted Potatoes, Fried Brussels Sprouts, and String Beans Gnocchi (with red sauce) Salmon - Honey Mustard Glazed Grilled Salmon with Haricots Verts & Buttered Red Potatoes Pappardelle with Wild Boar Ragu Broccolini Sauteed with Garlic  Filet (which is what I ate) - I ordered it medium rare. It came and about 1/2 of it was medium well and 1/2 was medium rare. I was a little disappointed but the crust and seasoning on the filet was spot on so it made up for it. My companions at dinner said \"did you get that medium rare? It looks over cooked four you.\" I was okay with it. The potatoes were lacking a bit in seasoning but very crispy and delicious. The fried brussel sprouts were great (to be fair though I LOVE brussel sprouts), my dinner dates all had to try them too. The beans needed a pinch of salt and maybe a little cracked pepper but over all they were decent as well. I did not like the sauce that they THANKFULLY put on the side. It was too... something. I couldn't quite place it, but it was on the side so i didn't have to eat it.  Gnocchi - My sister LOVES gnocchi, specifically Casbah's gnocchi. She said well this is an italian joint, I should get pasta. it came and it looked pretty standard. Her review is as follows: It was alright, it was your typical gnocchi, the shape of the pasta was more little tubular things than typical gnocchi. The sauce wasn't very good. It needed some more seasoning or something. It was just really bland and I was a bit disappointed.  Salmon - My friend got the salmon, she didn't say too much about it. She said it was good. She cleaned her plate and seemed pretty jazzed about it.  Pappardelle - My other friend didn't finish her food or the broccolini she ordered. She said it was \"pretty good\" and she took the leftovers for later. She had never had wild boar and decided it tasted like \"regular type meat\".   Two of our four top ordered tiramisu. I tasted a bite of it. It looked house made, like it was cut from a big giant pan. They gave you a pretty hefty slice of it too. The tiramisu was the star of the entire dinner. They raved about how delicious it was, and to be real, it was super good. Some of the best tiramisu I've ever had.   We got our bill, split it four ways, I'll take care of the meat plate I said. The wine can be split between the three checks if that's possible (it was).   I got my bill, with tip... $115. (Cocktail, 1/3 wine, meat plate, salad, filet) So definitely not an everyday spot for me. I definitely do not make enough money or would want to try to justify spending that much on dinner weekly. I think when we do this again we'll pick a different restaurant that's a little more budget friendly.",

    "text": "I've been to Senti a few times. It errs on the expensive side but time and time again the food proves to be worth the price.   They serve complimentary bread with butter. I personally like the saltiness of the bread.   I've had a few salads, though the menu has changed/morphed a few times since their opening. I particularly enjoyed the watermelon salad on their Nuovo menu; it has ricotta salata, pistachio, and a soy dressing and is soooooo tasty.   I've ordered the cheese plate on a few visits as well. I've never received the same cheeses on consecutive visits and they are usually paired with accoutrements like jam, honey, and garlic. I like that you can have a new experience every visit.   Some standout main dishes are the gnocchi and the lasagna. I am a huge proponent of bechamel on lasagna and they've nailed it.   Their bartender is always mixing up new drinks along with some classics. If you're into cocktails, definitely give the specials a try.",

I made a reservation on OpenTable for 6:30p on a Thursday, but I was surprised to see how empty it was. It was also raining, so I'm sure people weren't wanting to go out.   I came with a group of six and got seated right away. They are very helpful when it comes to selecting wine, and I ended up getting two glasses of their red blend because it was so good.   Lucky for me I always go to restaurants with friends and family that want to share everything so I was able to try a lot of the menu!! The soup of the day was a great choice but not as tasty as I wanted it to be; it was a tomato truffle soup. We also ordered the short rib, which was amazing, and the beet salad. All of the options are fairly small so I highly recommend ordering a bunch of plates and sharing them all.   I split the salmon dish and the fettuccine carbonara with my sister. Both were soooo tasty and amazing. The salmon was cooked perfectly, and the noodles in the fettuccine were clearly made in-house and so delicious.   Our servers were also super friendly and attentive. We parked on the street, which I'm assuming is usually packed since Lawrenceville is becoming a hot spot in Pittsburgh, so plan accordingly when making dinner plans at Senti!",

Over 6 months after my boyfriend's birthday, we came back for my August birthday. We had Marissa as a server again and she remembered us without even prompting! I was extremely impressed by that--as I stated in my previous review, she was amazing (again).  We both got the Rucola salad (Arugula, Sliced Pear, Shaved Parmiggiano, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, and Balsamic Vinegar), which was a great size and delicious. The only suggestion I would give is for a little bit more pear given the large amount of Arugula.  For our next courses, my boyfriend ordered the spaghetti which he enjoyed. However, it was nothing compared to my gnocchi! Their gnocchi of the day was squash and cherry tomatoes in a white wine butter sauce. PHENOMENAL!   I then ordered the filet mignon for my main course. It was delicious and I loved the salt on top. However, given that I ordered an arugula salad before, I wish I had asked for a different side than the arugula salad that came with it.   I ordered the chocolate bread pudding for dessert and of course it came out with a candle! When Marissa brought our check, she gave us two complimentary mini shots of a new chamomile liqueur to try. I'm not a huge fan of liqueurs, but I enjoyed it!   Thanks for another great meal, Senti! See you next time!",

    "text": "My companion and I dined there on Saturday evening. We walked in with no reservations and noticed that there were many empty tables, the only restaurant in the neighborhood that wasn't bustling with patrons?  We were seated immediately by a very friendly hostess, the menu looked great. When I discovered that the food is sourced locally and the beef was \"grass fed\" and the vegetables were \"organic\", I was delighted. It did seem odd that there was no mention of this on the menu?  The waitstaff was friendly,  it was obvious that they were a mix of young not so professional people, but I am always willing to overlook that if I know that I am going to be served healthy, clean food, which I am now questioning.  So, cutting to the chase.I ordered the soup du jour, cream of tomato. From the color, it looked like they just opened cans of tomato sauce and added paste for a deeper red color. It was a huge disappointment, as it was extremely bland. We also ordered salads, and some other appetizers, mushrooms sauteed with brandy and some meatballs and pasta with marinara sauce. The mushrooms tasted undercooked and salty, I could not detect even a hint of brandy, the meatballs were completely bland too. The pasta was good and cooked to perfection, but again, the sauce was completely bland.  I decided to take the mushrooms home and \"doctor them up\". They were handed to me in a paper bag along with a few other things.When I got home and lifted up the bag, I discovered the entire bottom was dripping. It leaked all over my companion's Lexus sportscar.  I decided to call and report the mishap. I was connected to the owner, Franco. When I told him what happened, his reaction was totally defensive and belligerent! He insisted that it was impossible, because he had been using the cheap paper \"recycled\" boxes for years and that never happened before and there was no oil or butter in the mushrooms, etc, etc. While yelling at me, he also asked me how much it would be to get the car cleaned, like I would know!!!  We will never go back. I don't believe the meat was grass fed and the greens are organic either? Why was there nothing on the menu to indicate that they are?   There is a reason why the restaurant had so many empty tables on a Saturday evening, when all the others in the neighborhood were completely full!!!",

    "text": "I was surprised with a \"happy last final\" dinner here the other week. Boy, what a great place to celebrate something special. First off, when I entered the restaurant we were greeted by the host who made a big deal out of my graduation. That was awesome that they remembered why my partner reserved a table and that they said something so they could share in part of it. We got a table that faced Butler Street and really it was perfect. The snow was falling and those big Windows let us look out onto Lawrenceville with a beautiful layer of snow and the snowflakes coming down. It was the perfect scene for the celebration of my last final of grad school. I really could not have asked for a better place than that. The server that we had was fantastic. She let us take our time with the menu, she laughed with us over my accomplishments, and she gave us some great suggestions on food. Perfecto.  Rucola Salad: We got a salad to share between the two of us. I was a little concerned at first that it wouldn't be enough but I had nothing to worry about. The salad was filling even when split between both of us. It had little pieces of fennel nice chunks of Parmesan cheese and a very light dressing on it. And I believe cranberries. Very good.  Fritto Misto: Fried Seafood and Vegetables Served with a Horseradish Marinara Sauce and Horseradish Aioli. This appetizer was also delicious. The serving size was pretty good, but with a lot of fried food I'm sure that I could have eaten more. I liked it a lot more when we sprinkle the lemon over it. Both of the sauces were okay but neither one of them really were my favorite. But I really really loved this dish and I didn't need much sauce in order to be fantastic.  Lasagna alla Veneta: Lasagna, Veneta Style, House-Made Pasta with Beef Ragu, Cheese and Bechamel Sauce. While this was not my dish, I did get a little bite of it. The bechamel sauce was delicious and something that I was not used to on lasagna. My partner loved it and he is a big lasagna eater. This one that he ordered had arugula baked in it. While he was apprehensive at first, he did state wow I like arugula. Not realizing that are salad had arugula in it also. He liked the spiciness of the lettuce.  Osso Buco di Maiale: Braised Pork Shank Served with Roasted Sweet Potato, Multi-Colored Cauliflower, Mashed Potatoes and Gremolata. This was fantastic. The pork was fall off the bone and done to perfection. The cauliflower and mashed potatoes with the sauce on top yum. My sweet potatoes could have been cooked a little bit more but they were still really good. I had enough to eat for lunch the next day, that's how big this dish was. It was a perfect dinner dish tha was large enough for leftovers.  Dessert: We opted out of dessert. Quite frankly all of that food was so filling I didn't think that we could stuff anymore in our bellies. But because it was a special occasion our waitress put one little scoop of honey ice cream in a dish with a candle. I loved that gesture. It is things like that that make me come back to restaurants the extra effort to make someone feel special. And that really did make me feel special. The ice cream was also delicious and I lick that bowl clean.  I cannot wait to come here again.",

Your money is better spent on the SOTD -Ask the servers about wine! They have an exceptional knowledge of the wine! We got some fabulous pairing suggestions. (Even though we researched a bit beforehand.) -Get the Pappardelle with Wild Boar Ragu, Lasagna is a close second!!!! -Get the Tiramisu - always  PS: Their fresh bread is delicious. Somewhere between focaccia and sourdough. I know we asked about it and our server was happy to divulge some bread info on it!",

And then I had their lasagna, which I was told was amazing and it really is. It's not heavy like some other restaurants and it's just the right size portion.  I finished off with their seasonal tart, which was an apple tart tonight, and again, it was the right size, fresh and delicious. The owner is on-site and very friendly, and the service was really nice.  My friends had the lamb chops, the steak and the special of the night which was Beef short ribs. For dessert they had the tiramisu, the profiterole's and the chocolate bread pudding. They all loved their dinner and desserts.",

Our waitress was very calm and relaxed, which also went along with the general vibe of the place - there was no rush to get you out and seat the next table, they genuinely wanted to make sure you were enjoying your food.  We ended up ordering two appetizers of the Fritto Misto.  Our meals all varied, but we all felt pleased with the restaurant overall.  Definitely worth a visit!",

We started with complimentary salted, rosemary focaccia and butter. The lunches came with either the soup of the day or a side salad. The dressing on the salad was delicious. The gnocchi is made with potatoes and is surprisingly light. The ragu is rich and flavorful but a little greasy. The fettuccine carbonara was good but could use a little something. We ended the meal with chocolate bread pudding which was fine.",

    "text": "I visited Senti a little while back for my first ever restaurant week experience (I know, crazy) and I have to say it was a great first experience. Looking at the photos on yelp it seemed like a upscale restaurant so we dressed nice for the occasion. I was a little nervous that we may be overdressed because that seems to happen a lot in the Pittsburgh area but thankfully we were dressed appropriately.   It's a cute little place that doesn't have a whole lot of tables. It had a very intimate, date night feel to it. I would say its a place better suited for parties of 2. Smaller parties would probably be ok but definitely not large parties.  For our courses we got a caprese salad and spaghetti with meatballs and marinara. It sounds boring but it's all authentic italian so it wasn't just your average pasta. I'm not even a huge meatball fan but I really liked these meatballs. I liked that they were smaller meatballs rather than huge meatballs. Something about the smaller ones just tastes better for some reason.  As far as the service goes, I was very pleased. They waitress was very attentive and checked on us periodically. She was able to suggest a wine for our meal that we both enjoyed. The owner was also walking around checking on tables to ask how everything was which is always a nice gesture. After this experience I would definitely like to go back some time and check out the full menu. Possibly my next date night!",

Others in the group had the roast pork, linguine, and probably something else that I am forgetting. Everyone was very happy with the food - both quantity and quality.  We skipped dessert but regretted it after seeing what others in the group ordered. Luckily they offered us a bite... Amazing.   We were a little concerned about service because most of the servers we saw looked pretty young but service turned out to be excellent.

The food was very mixed.  The bread and the prosciutto appetizer were good, but anything that actually needed to be cooked or prepared was disappointing. The ribeye steak special was thin and very overlooked (medium rare = mostly gray throughout, and tough). The fettuccini was overlooked and chewy.  Paired with the wine it all made sense together as a disappointment.   For the price, this place is a huge letdown. If this were a $30 meal for two I would've been impressed but for $200, money would be better spent elsewhere.",

The restaurant is a \"cool\" kind of place and it felt very New \"Yorky\" to be here.  It is open and airy and the small bar is even a great place to pull your chair up and have some great wine and a bite. All in all, we feel this place is well worth it to eat here and enjoy the food and the atmosphere.",

    "text": "We were very excited to try Senti but it was such a let down!   We got there on a Friday night and there were only three other tables.  Four different servers kept filling up our waters but no one came over to take our drink order for a good 15 minutes.  It was bizarre.  We started with the fritto misto and it was so bad.  It was tiny baby shrimp, calamari rings, and the most pathetic display of vegetables I have ever seen.  It was SO SKIMPY for what it was and wasn't even good.  Then we each had the mixed salad that lacked so much flavor... it was just lettuce no dressing.  I am not a fan of over drenched  salads but this literally had NO dressing.  My husband then got the lasagna... it was a tiny portion and said it was nothing special.  I got the bronzino and the fish was good but the gnocchi it came with was just awful.  I am pregnant so didn't have anything to drink and with this amount of food and my husband having two glasses of wine... the bill came to $150.  Which wouldn't be bad if it had been a good meal but it was terrible.  What a waste of money.",

    "text": "While on a visit with my daughter from Miami, someone recommended us this restaurant as a must visit restaurant and area of Pittsburg. We were pleasantly impressed. Before entering we already knew we have being properly recommended. The restaurant is designed and set up in a very elegant modern minimalist manner. The menu was equally impressive and varied enough to satisfy the more demanding appetites looking for sophisticated but affordable, authentic Italian flavors. Food presentation was totally on point. Their wine selection was excellent, and my college level daughter really enjoyed their self dispensing wine bar. But the most impressive part of our experience was the awesome service we received from the entire staff, but especially our waiter Sofia and the owner Franco. From the moment we got to restaurant,  to half an hour before they close; they told us not to worry about that and they meant it. From the foods, wines, to places to visit afterwards suggestions; they could not have done a better job of accommodating and making us feel welcome both at their restaurant and their city. Lawrenceville, the area this restaurant is located in is an up and coming part of Pittsburg with a really cool vibe. We would definitely be back and would highly recommend as a must visit when in town.",

We were offered the lounge area but fortunately there was a cancellation and we were shown to a table. The service was friendly and prompt. The first thing to come out was some bread. It was a salted focaccia with rosemary and it was amazing. Some of the best bread I've ever had. We both had wines which were good to start off the meal. From there we went straight into entrees. She had the salmon which was breaded, and she said it was excellent. I don't even eat seafood, and the bite I tried was very tasty. I went with the ribeye which was a special that night. It was a pan cooked steak but it was excellent as well. Had a great flavor and was cooked right. The side with the steak was a salad which was just OK, but overall I was very satisfied with both my wine and steak. The atmosphere in Senti was also very nice and modern. The crowd was on the older side but the place had a good vibe. Senti is definitely a great asset to the neighborhood and I'm sure I'll be back again.",
