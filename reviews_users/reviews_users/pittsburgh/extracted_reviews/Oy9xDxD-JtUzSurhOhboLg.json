I like my food relatively pure so I got the basic sugar or liege waffle topped with whipped cream. Parts of the waffle were super-duper sweet (like licking a cube of sugar covered in real maple syrup sweet). The sweetness don't stop me, because the whipped cream helped balance it out. If you don't mind paying $4-9 for a simple and relatively small waffle then give this place a try. The waffle iron could have used a good cleaning to avoid burnt sugar all over the waffle, but it was tasty enough. I recommend going here for a snack or with kids, but not as a meal option unless you want to buy 2-3 individual waffles per person. I plan to go to the original Squirrel Hill location, because I've been told that it is so much better.",

I don't think the worker said a word to me (except for the price), but he seemed pleasant.  When you order a waffle, he takes a ball of pre-portioned dough and plops it into the waffle iron, which can hold about four at a time. The waffle is then placed in a cardboard box and topped. I got my waffle with speculoos spread.  The waffle was delicious: crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and warm. It tasted great by itself, but its holes were great for holding the speculoos, which tasted like liquid butter cookies and had the consistency of warm peanut butter. It wasn't too sweet, either, and the amount didn't overpower the waffle. A great treat for the middle of the day! Though the waffle is small, it's thick. It's a good portion size and fairly priced.",

The girl baking the waffles didn't have her long hair tied back and I found ~4 hairs in my waffle. After the fourth hair, I took my waffle up to the front desk to bring attention to the issue and without even looking at my waffle, the shift supervisor (different from the girl baking my waffle) said, \"I don't want to tell you that you're wrong but those are sugar strings from our batter...not hair.\" At that point, I pulled out a long hair from the waffle and only then did she admit that it was a hair. No apologies or effort on their end to rectify the situation.  I actually had to ask for a refund before she agreed. Very disappointing.",

    "text": "While I fully endorse and 100% recommend the Waffallonia on Murray Ave(Squirrel Hill), I was completely disappointed by the one on Forbes. I spotted this branch when walking by with some friends from out of town this weekend and had to drag everyone to try my \"favorite dessert in the burgh\"! When we got to the counter, the girl at the window seemed busy and so we waited for her to look up. In a couple minutes when she made no move to even acknowledge the 4 of us at her window, I said erm.. excuse me, are you open? No response while she continues to busily work on something at her chair. Now I reaaallly wanted my friends to try this so I tried again, just in case she hadn't heard me the first time (although she probably had). \"Excuse me, are you open?\" .. \"You'll have to wait one moment\".. comes the curt reply while she continues to look down doing whatever it is she was busy with. We wait.. for a whole 15 minutes.. only because I insisted to my friends that it's gonna totally be worth the wait (and her attitude)! Finally she looked up, annoyed that we decided to keep waiting - \"Yes?\". I proceeded to order the same exact thing as I always get at the other branch - The Antwerp with the Nutella ice cream and speculoos sauce. We'd run out of patience and to spare her the effort, decided on just the one to share. Now the best thing about Waffallonia, is that warm fresh soft waffle and the cold scoop of ice cream over it! Gosh I could eat one now! BUTTT imagine my disappointment when she slapped a cold hard waffle, made who knows how long before onto a plate and a bunch of goopy melted ice-cream that was dripping from the sides already and handed it to me! We'd waited all this while, so I paid for it. When she handed me my change, I asked for a receipt and she said the machine was broken! Hmm... Well.. my much hyped up \"Antwerp\" was a complete fail.. and my friends think I'm ridiculous for talking up these waffles!!! But I told them and I'm telling you - Go to the Squirrel Hill branch. It's less than two miles away. Because THAT is the best dessert in the Burgh. This one on Forbes is just it's mean twin!",

I usually get my waffle with cinnamon ice cream... my god. If you're having a bad day, this combo will soothe your aching heart like a comforting mother; if you're having a good day, go here and treat yourself, you've earned it.   The fifth star here comes solely from the euphoria inducing nexus of fresh waffle and not-too-sweet ice cream. From the moment I start eating it, it's a race to the death (of the waffle): can I take the last bite while the waffle is still warm?   If this was any better, it would be a schedule 1 narcotic.",

Pros: We got the Charleroi and it came with nutella, strawberries, bananas, and ice cream! We chose the Speculoos ice cream and it was delicious. Obviously this is pretty much a combo that you can't mess up, so of course it tasted good! The waffle was nice and warm.  Cons: I feel like it was kinda small for around $6-7? If it were $4-5 I wouldn't be complaining, but for $6-7 I would expect something really really special. I would rate this place 3.5 stars, but I rounded down since the service wasn't anything special either, not that friendly.   Overall: I'd come here to satisfy the occasional waffle craving if I lived in Pittsburgh!",

The smell of fresh belgian waffles and ice cream hung in the air. My friend and I had been to the one in Squirrel Hill so we knew what we were in for. At first we doubted the quality of food that could be prepared in a space comparable to that of Harry's cupboard but we were pleasantly surprised!   We had the waffle with speculoos and nutella ice cream. I must advise everyone to get speculoos on their waffle. Why? Because it melts (MELTS) on the warm waffle and becomes a kind of thick syrup and drips over the sides of your perfectly caramelized waffle.  Keep in mind that they do run out of supplies if they get busy so get there before the herd.",

For appx $6.50 you get a sweet sugar waffle with all the toppings you can dream of including but not limited to Nutella, cookie butter, strawberries, bananas, and six different ice cream flavors.   Every waffle I have ordered has been drool worthy. The portion size is perfect and the price is just fair!   The store recently moved just one or two shops down Murray with another location in Oakland. The Murray location is now bigger with more seating but sometimes on busy days you still may have to wait a little for a seat. The turnaround on the waffles is rarely than 5 minutes.   Check it out!!",

The waffles were delicious... soft yet crispy on the exterior and perfectly sweet. They serve up their waffles with Dave & Andy's ice cream. (Well, if you want ice cream... but who wouldn't want ice cream?!) I had never tried Dave & Andy's ice cream before, but after tasting the incredible cinnamon concoction tonight, it's at the top of my must-try places list. I also couldn't resist a little nutella on top.  Even though the prices aren't cheap (approximately $5 per waffle), it's totally worth the cost. I actually appreciated the smaller portion size. You could literally make yourself sick off these waffles!  They offer plenty on the menu to keep you satisfied and trying something new every time... whipped cream, ice cream, chocolate syrup, strawberries, bananas, nutella, and speculoos. (If you're a Trader Joe's shopper, you probably know what speculoos is! It's a magical peanut butter-type spread made from graham crackers.) I'll definitely be back soon!",

That really doesn't make it any easier to resist though.   There's not much to say in the way of service. The guy working the stand that day seemed pretty bored out of his mind, but he still did his job. Unfortunately, they ran out of milk, so my friend had to change his milkshake order.  The waffle & ice cream we each got essentially lived up to our expectations. Nothing terribly special, just two very sugary desserts combined into one very sugary dessert. It's something you could probably make at home yourself very easily.   My favorite part was the nutella ice cream on mine, which they get from Dave & Andy's just a few streets away. If anything, save yourself a few bucks and calories and head there for your sweet fix instead. :)",

The space is small, stools for 6 at little bars in the back. Plenty of toppings to choose from and Dave and Andys ice cream.  I was recently introduced the liege waffles courtesy of Tartine and I can honestly say, oh lord I may get shot, but I preferred Tartines. That being said, the waffles here are good and the toppings are fantastic, but if you are coming for just the waffle and no toppings then I would say head to the west end village. If you are more interested in a variety of choices then this is your place. The waffle just felt a little under cooked, not as carmelized and crispy as I would prefer. A quick note about the Dave and Andys ice cream, holy cow is the specculos ice cream just to die for!!! Perfectly creamy with just the right amount of cookie butter, this stuff is fantab!!! I'm SO glad there isn't a location closer to me because I'd be as big as a house if there were!!!",

Waffallonia has definitely caused me to rethink how I view waffles though.  I ordered the Antwerp special (chocolate sauce + speculoos ice cream + sugar waffle), and it was absolutely phenomenal. The cooked sugar crystals on the exterior of the waffle provide a nice crunch that is an excellent textural contrast with the soft interior of the waffle. Anyone who has ever had the cookie butter from Trader Joe's knows how great speculoos tastes. The richness of the ice cream complemented the waffle really well. We savored every bite of this dessert and seriously contemplated ordering another one (we decided to save room for dinner).  If you are near Pitt and are looking for a snack/dessert, I would highly recommend checking out Waffallonia.",

It's located in Schenley Plaza right across the road from the Cathedral and since I visit Cathy quite often, I find myself visiting Waffallonia probably more than I would like to admit.   I absolutely loveeeee the sugar waffles whether they are plain or topped with something wonderful. They are always fresh and made to order. Love them when they are super warm!! The main options are ice cream, Nutella, strawberries or bananas. Depending on the season, my go to choices are ice cream with Nutella and strawberries or Nutella, strawberries and bananas. Soooo delish.  The staff are always pleasant and the area is always clean. Plus you can almost always find a seat.",

We ordered the Bruges which is their sugar waffle with strawberries and whip. It was the first time we've had a sugar waffle and we loved it! It provided a nice crunchy texture contrast to the flakiness of the dough and was paired perfectly with fresh fruit and a light whip that wasn't too sweet. A great mid day snack!!",

The strawberries were pretty fresh. The waffle was well worth the wait, but I'm not sure about $6.27 unless you really pack on the toppings! I honestly thought the waffle could have been a little bigger, nonetheless, a great tasting treat!",

The soft ice cream melting over top of the warm, crunchy waffle is something dreams are made of (*cue Lizzie McGuire song*).  The wait can be brutally long, especially on nice days when everyone is out on Schenley Plaza. In my experience, they can take forever to fulfill an order, but hey, you can't rush perfection.",

I will dream of these yummy waffles and savor the moment when I will visit Pittsburgh again.   This little establishment is located in Schenley Park and is a perfect place for you to relax after a long day of sightseeing around the University of Pittsburgh and the surrounding Carnegie Museum of Natural History and Art. There are plenty of outdoor seating around this place or you can sit on the grass at the park.   The waffle is fluffy, lightly sweetened, and warm. There are several varieties that you can choose from but I decided to order Waffalonia for $6 because you can add as many toppings as you would like but will just receive smaller amounts of each. I ordered my waffle with Nutella (because who doesn't love Nutella?), strawberries, banana, and a scoop of creamy vanilla bean ice cream. The order came out really quickly after placing an order and the service was great as well. I barely made it in time to take a picture of this treat before taking an initial bite. I about died and gone to heaven when I tried it!  It was divine! It didn't take too long before my hubby and I finished eating it! I   I highly suggest coming here! You will not regret it! I am already looking forward to going again!",
