    "text": "I ate here two Thursdays ago with a dining companion.  The entrance to the restaurant feels a bit cramped when you first get inside but it is also unique as you are able to see their bakery.  Once we made it to the hostess we were greeted almost immediately and given the selection between sitting inside and sitting outside in the heated patio.  We chose the patio and were able to see almost all of the restaurant on the walk out.  There were a lot of trinkets and items that would make you think of France and the tables were covered in white table clothes.  We decided to get the Feuillete D' Asperges which was described as blanched green asparagus in puff pastry with a Hollandaise sauce.  Whenever it came it was immediately apparent that it was not as it was described as the asparagus was draped over the puff pastry.  My dining companion also mentioned this so I know that it was not my thoughts alone. Regardless of that it still tasted very good and we enjoyed it.  For dinner I decided to have the Steak-Frites.  The presentation of the dish was nice with the fries in a cute little basket.  However I was disappointed with how mushy the fries were.  Whenever I think of frites I think of crunchy fries and these fries not at all.  They did have a good taste to them.  The best part of the entree though was the steak which was juicy and cooked and cooked to a perfect medium.  Whenever it came time for dessert we were presented with both a dessert menu and a list of 2 dozen or so macaroons that they make on the premise.  My dining companion and I decided to split the dessert of the day which ended up being a layered cake with fresh berries.   This was easily the best part of the whole dinner as the cake was moist, the frosting separating the layers cool and the tart of the lemon matched well with the sweetness of the berries.  We also decided to indulge ourselves and each got a macaroon, myself the lavender and my dining companion a basil and lemon or lime.  I enjoyed trying both of them and would like to try some more of their flavors in the future as it is not something that you normally see in Pittsburgh.  The bottom line for me is that I would come back here in the future.  The dessert was easily the best part of the meal although the entree and appetizer was solid too.",

On my most recent visit, I ordered the Paris 66 buckwheat crepes (that are filled with ham and cheese, topped with an egg and small portions of a salad, stewed tomatoes, and sauteed mushrooms). The flavors are rich and fresh, yet blend together perfectly.  The service was quite good; the servers were attentive, professional and friendly. And the restaurant itself has such a charming interior and a nice patio for outdoor seating (with heat lamps for when you go in the winter!)",

I realize that this was not the fault of our server but the kitchen and management handled it very poorly. Our party of four had the last reservation for brunch on Mother's Day. After the drinks and Appetizers the experience was very unprofessional and inexcusable. Two entrees were initially served followed by the third about 7 minutes later and another 5 minutes before the final entree was served. By the time the last was served everything had become cold. The steak hache ordered medium rare was very well done but was replaced with a Filet, only because they ran out of the hache (and baguettes and pear tarts as well). The worst part is the manager did NOTHING but cop an arrogant attitude. There are many other restaurants that I will frequent but Paris 66 will not be one of those.",

Forget the fact that you are greeted in French; even without that, this place has the European \"you've got the table for the night\" feel.  All in all, it was a delightful experience.

    "text": "Kay had been wanting to hit Paris 66 since her birthday passed, so I belatedly took her there last weekend. Before I pile deserved praises onto the food, I will mention a few problems I had that add up to one deducted star.   1) The tables are too small. 2) The seating is cramped. I can dig communal dining, but this was uncomfortable. The folks on either side of us were literally bumping into me as were the servers.  3) For such an upmarket restaurant, I found it slightly tacky that instead of having a soda fountain, Paris 66 brings diners plastic bottles of whatever soft drink they request. My Sprite container looked terribly out of place on the table, so much so that it almost made me wish I had requested water instead. 4) We were unfortunately seated next to a party of very rude, intrusive, old, monied women who kept interrupting our \"intimate\" meal to complain about the restaurant. These big-haired, red-lipsticked, leopard-printed hags, who could have come straight from central casting (file under 'in-laws' or 'rich, elderly country club snobs'), were offended that we were served before them despite the fact that we arrived before they did and literally and openly felt that they mattered more than us. After all, they were \"regulars\" and their husbands were \"important.\" One of them stared at me during our entire meal while occasionally whispering to her companion and pointing her long. bony finger at me. When I smiled at her, she scowled. Did she know who I was and dislike me for my politics? After all, I did get a very real Scaife family vibe from the ladies, but I digress...  Nevertheless, Paris 66's food, while not inexpensive, was flawless to my palate. Going all-out, we ordered two appetizers: Beef Carpaccio and Fried Artichokes. The shaved meat of the carpaccio was tiled ornately onto the cold plate and was  garnished with a basic vinaigrette-dressed salad that clarified the taste buds with its snap. Carpaccio is a bit tricky to consume considering how everything adheres to the eating surface, but the fresh, uncooked proteins made the work worthwhile. I'd always wanted to try this ever since I saw it made on the TV program \"Great Chefs,\" but the piece never showed how a diner is supposed to approach it. Let's just say my butterknife proved useful. The artichokes were facile, breaded, hot fat joy. The large, brawny, fleshy artichokes were steamed sublimely beneath what was a crunchy, almost sweet coating. A serving of greens topped with a creamy dressing embellished the plate and proved refreshing.  Bewildered as to what my entree would be, I instantly jumped on one of the specials of the night in Seafood Bouillabaisse as did Kay. I know, we ordered the same dish! That doesn't happen often.  The bowl was deceptively deep and comprised a very ample serving of an  ambrosial stew that hid a menagerie of marine creatures. Shrimp, swordfish, mussels, clams, crab, baby scallops, and Neptune knows what else all bobbed up and down in the murky, yellow brew. Every single morsel (my favorite being the fall-apart nuggets of swordfish) was perfection in terms of taste as well as texture and was everything seafood should be. Once I came to the sorrowful realization that the pieces of meat were no more, I eagerly downed the empty broth like a thirsty viking and used the bread to sop up the remainder.    Again, feeling frisky, we went with 3 desserts, each one triumphant in its own way. An artful strawberry tart was first, a marscarpone cake was second, and a hazelnut cake made for the finale. I relished the hazelnut the most as the moist cake obscured large hazelnuts that were akin to cereal box-prizes. The mascarpone cake was angelic and lighter than helium in every way, its subtle sweetness rewarding slow...easy consumption. The strawberry tart was blessed with an Art Deco spirit that almost prevented us from eating it for fear of destroying its design, but once we broke it down, we found that its beauty was more than skin deep. Speaking of skin, a sugary fruit \"roll-up\" was its hide and held a milky, buttery filling underneath that itself held a vibrant, ripened strawberry.   Ryan, our waiter, indicated that he was in the prime of his career by providing keen service and displaying Olympian-level social acrobatics and patience even with customers who were less than friendly or polite (I'm talking about the party on the OTHER side of us who didn't thank Ryan for a single thing and ignored him even as he was trying to serve them their dinners. I suppose the phrase 'Money doesn't buy you class' applies.). As we left, he gushingly approached us and asked us which dessert we liked best. I felt as if this young man's heart's desire is to make customers happy, and we did indeed leave happy despite our encounters with the wealthy and uncouth.   P.S. Kay will have to tell you about the macaroons. She took home a dozen or so. Yup. Having a girlfriend is costly, but...she's worth it.",

I go often because this is the only place in Pittsburgh to get truly outstanding French wines for a reasonable price. They have carefully selected wines from all over France, but my favorites right now are the Bordeaux, especially the Pomerol from Chateau Vieux Chevrol. They have a special collection of Rhone and Borgogne as well. Also, the atmosphere is wonderful, and the service is second to none. Personable, and very knowledgable. You will feel special and for the time you are there you will feel just a bit French. Go and go often.",

I stopped in off of the street to get a pain au chocolat which they advertise for $3(they also sell baugettes, croissants, and a few other things in a similar way), but after learning that they bake them on-demand(pre-ordering recommended) and that it would take 15 minutes I opted for the apple tart I saw in the pastry case.  The service was friendly but the tart was actually priced as a full-fledged dessert, so that wound up costing about 3x as much as I had entered intending to pay. You might say that's my fault, and it would be more appropriately priced had I just finished dinner at this place, but to walk up to a counter and ask for something from behind the glass to be so expensive was a bit much for me.  C'est la vie, though - they sprinkled it with powdered sugar and sent me along my way with a small side of homemade caramel. When I got home, I gave it a taste, it was really delicious, and the caramel sauce was out of this world. I would eat that stuff on just about any dessert item they had. It took away most of the sting of the purchase, and I'm glad I stopped in, and I will return to get my pain au chocolat",

The main approval is that they have a traditional crepe with the browned dots and edges and nice chewy texture.

Instead of a mediocre creperie, it has evolved into a more substantial brasserie, offering typical \"everyday French restaurant\" fares.  The good news is that it is actually a very decent brasserie (unlike its early day attempts at being a creperie). For lunch, we ordered a quiche and a ham-and-cheese puff pastry. Both were very nicely prepared -- the puff pastry was buttery; the quiche has a delicious custardy inside and a golden flakey crust.   The prices of the items generally run high; they charge about twice what others charge for a similar dish (e.g., $13 for a savory crepe). I am still undecided as to whether their quality really justify doubling the price. Further investigations will be needed.",

    "text": "My wife and I used to frequent Paris 66 when we first moved to PGH, and loved our first 2 or 3 visits. Unfortunately, about a year ago, we noticed that the quality of the experience slipped significantly, and we stopped making this our go-to place when out and about on Saturday afternoons for lunch. We have voted for it in the local votes for \"Best French Restaurant\" before, because of our positive initial experiences there.  When we first tried the place, we really enjoyed their chicken (a simple, yet truly delicious dish...), mussels, and nicoise salad. All of these dishes were at least as good, if not better than some of the great food we enjoyed when we visited Paris.  Our last visit there was several months ago for \"Brunch\" - definitely a disappointment. None of the dishes that came as part of our $18 \"Brunch\" were good - the eggs were runny, the pain au chocolat was cold, and side salad was uninspired. We were so disappointed, we have taken a \"break\" from the place for the last several months. Recently, we have noticed that their website and menu have been revamped and are considering a return there to try things out again.  We have never had the problems with the wait staff that other reviewers have had, and frequently have enjoyed short, friendly conversations with them during our visits - for us, they have been an enjoyable part of the experience, as they always treated our family and children well.  Pricing is a little high for the dishes served, and the lunch menu could use a \"tweak\" perhaps to make the portions smaller and less expensive to encourage throughput. Perhaps trimming down the number of dishes on the regular menu would allow the team to focus even more on execution, consistency, and value for their patrons. We would love to see Paris 66 return to the high level we first enjoyed, and know they definitely have what it takes to make this happen.",

Great desserts, they have a really talented pastry chef.   I was really charmed by my first visit here, and I'm sure it won't be my last.",

The setting is nice, a relatively small joint in East Liberty, and the service was very good. My cocktail was tasty, and the onion soup was well made but somewhat generic in the brown crock with melted cheese all over a-la chain restaurants. I had the rabbit which was delicious but had been sitting out and wasn't hot when it arrived. My wife's filet mignot was hot though, and very tasty, a perfect medium rare. For dessert the creme  brulee was excellent.  Our waitress was great, helpful but not too intrusive. This place is great if you want to experience some French cuisine in Western PA.",

Last month, we went back, and was almost turned away, but we got a table.  We started with the escargot, which was good, but a repeat of the duck fell short of the first experience.  It was dry and not eatable.  Furthermore, the server was rather rude and acted as if she had better places to be.    Another Pittsburgh restaurant that we will never spend another dime in.",

The waiters were extremely friendly, and the ambiance of the restaurant was extremely vibrant and authentic.  It was adorable how the waiters greeted patrons in French. Also, the owner of Paris 66 came up and introduced herself, which I thought was really sweet.  The food was AMAZING. It's currently restaurant week in Pittsburgh, so many places are having a special deal on the food. I got to try escargot (for the first time), beef wellington, and macarons, all for $30.  The escargot was really tender, and garlicky. It was interesting haha. :p Of course my favorite part was the mararons. In fact, I liked them so much, I took half a dozen home!  My friends and I are definitely coming back. The fact that there was a really cute waiter definitely didn't hurt either ;D",

    "text": "This is my first review on Yelp.  My wife has been encouraging me to join her in reviewing the places that we go so here goes nothing.  My wife refers to me as The H...  So I will refer to her as \"My Lady\" So my lady and I went to Paris 66 on Friday the 15th of August.  We were celebrating restaurant week and my lady actually let me pick a restaurant for us to go to.  So I picked here.  I've never been in a French restaurant before so I wanted to try it out.  When we pulled up to the restaurant we saw there was a sign for valid parking for only $3.  That was great so we used their valid service.  We had reservations so we were seated right away.  So far so good.  But then we just waited and waited for some service.  I was pretty sure who our waiter was going to be.  He sounded like a nice guy and he was knowledgeable about the menu and other things.  I over heard him at a few other tables.    Finally after 10 minutes he came to us.  By then we were ready to order and we knew what we wanted to drink.  So he took our drink order only and went to make it.  We waited probably another 10 minutes for him to come back.  I was thirsty and we had no water either.  I hinted to my lady that this may be more like a European Restaurant which is slower and you just have to be patient and enjoy yourself and talk!  So we tried that.  He came back with our drinks and then took our order.  Since it was restaurant week there for a few different choices selected from the chef that was part of the menu.  My lady and I wanted to try that and not the menu.  So my lady starts to order first.  She wanted the Boeuf Bourguignon  but the waiter said he wouldn't order that if he was her.  He didn't really think it was a good choice on the menu.  He wanted us to order from their main menu it seemed.  So then the other choice was Salmon and he said he's not a big fan of Salmon but he does really like this one.  Weird but she went with the Salmon.  I told him I'll risk it and go with the Boeuf anyways!   So time goes by and we still haven't received our bread.  It took about 30 minutes to get some bread.  My lady ordered some Escargot.  It was delicious but it took another 15 minutes to get here.  We both ordered goat cheese salads and we probably didn't get those until after an hour since we sat down.  I liked our waiter but I'm not sure if it was his fault or not.  He kind of reminded us of Jessie Pinkerman on Breaking Bad if you're a fan of the show!  Anyways the salad was good it just took too long to come.   Finally our main entree came.  We waited an hour in a half for our main entree.  There was another family sitting next to us that got their a little while after we did they were experiencing the same problems.  No drinks, no bread, really slow service.  So my Boeuf tasted really good.  It just was a really small plate for $35.  I was still hungry.  So would we ever come again?  Probably not.  I really liked the atmosphere.  The food was really good but too pricey for the amount of food that you get.  Even with that I would return but we won't be returning because it took us two in half hours to have dinner there.  It made us tired.  My lady and I are not in our 20's anymore so this drawn out dinner closed out an early night for the Nelson's.",

Service was solid, very good wait times between courses and appropriate hands off service (as is common in Europe, and Americans should learn to appreciate). Our waitress was plenty attentive, water glass was always full and she knew the menu well.   Started out with the Paris 66 galette - which was pretty good and recommended by our waitress.   Followed by the mussels in the Roquefort broth which everyone enjoyed.    Our mains were less impressive:   The duck was very good, cooked perfectly to order, however the raspberry sauce was too prominent.   The lamb stew (navarin d'agneau pritanier) was tasty, however the lamb was way overcooked and tough.   The pasta with shrimp (crevettes provencales) was okay.",

    "text": "Well...  I really wanted to give Paris 66 another try.  I felt like I'd missed something great here.    All the elements are here.  It's an adorable French bistro.  Cute setting and the menu looks amazing!  Last time I only had a salad so I was ready to go all out.  Great thing was, the lunch menu offered a 3 course meal for $14.99.  It included a coffee or iced tea, choice of soup or salad, 5 different main plates and then a handful of desserts.  Not a bad deal for those who want a taste of it all.    I decided to pick the warm goat cheese salad and Bastille Crepe. We received our ice teas and we waited. And waited. And waited some more. Then one slightly unenthusiastic apology from the waitress saying \"something was messed up\" with our order. Others beside us kept on ordering and getting food.  An HOUR passed by with no food. We finally had to summon over a manager who apologized and then 10 minutes later the salad appeared. A SALAD. It takes an hour to make a salad? I don't know what really happened... but I know it shouldn't have. It wasn't busy at all. Only three other tables in the dinning room with lots of different servers around. It was really irritating and I was HANGRY (hungry + angry)!  We then received our main dishes about 10 minutes after that and my crepe was a total letdown. It was a beautiful looking crepe, but frankly, it tasted like condensed cream of mushroom soup on top of some spinach and a crepe. Plus it was lukewarm. Major fail!   Our waitress then starting to do the \"save face so that I can still get a tip\" act and gave compliment after compliment to us. For all of this, during a lunch that we were EXTREMELY patient with (good thing we didn't have a strict lunch schedule), they comped us a couple macaroons...which in my opinion, there should have been more!  I've worked in the restaurant biz and personally felt for all of that, our meal should have been comped. Worst of all, the manager never even came back over to ask if everything was okay. Poor costumer service. Too bad, I had high hopes.",

We were asked to sit on the patio since it was nice outside. There were a few other parties but it was pretty quiet with a light rain while we enjoyed our meal.   I wasn't very hungry and was feeling adventurous, so I had the escargot bourguignon. Let me tell you, it was great! It was my very first time having escargot, but if you like the buttery, garlic sauce that it is served in, you will not mind the escargot at all.   I also had the La Bastille crepe, which I added egg and cheese to. For me, this was just ok. Maybe I was wrong to order a crepe. Maybe I should let the creperies do crepres, and opted for a regular entree item.   I was too full from dessert, but I most likely would have had macarons, which are housed from Gaby Et Jules over in Squirrel Hill.   I will definitely be back!",

I do enjoy a good snail, and the escargot was decent. Very buttery and garlicky. It might have been a little bit too buttery as each snail I picked up left a little pool of butter. It tasted more like butter than snails.   The beef wellington was also decent, though there was nothing special about it. Just a piece of beef wrapped in puff pastry. It came with a side of blanched asparagus.   The best part of the meal was definitely the macarons. We were able to choose three flavors out of the flavors they had for the day. I chose pumpkin, passionfruit chocolate, and praline. My favorite was the passionfruit chocolate. The slightly tartness of the passionfruit paired well with the chocolate.  This restaurant is very cute. They put up photos and decorations from France all over the restaurant and most of the staff have a French accent.   I do think the food is slightly overpriced.

    "text": "It was Pittsburgh Restaurant week and I was beyond excited to try a few new places.  We booked reservations to two places, one being Paris 66 Bistro  and this was the H's pick.  I checked out their prefixed menu online and thought yea this could be really good.     Parking was tricky, but they have a valet at a very reasonable price of $3.00.  The restaurant is quaint but nicely decorated.  They have white table cloths but cover them with paper I guess to save the effort of changing the linens every few hours.  When I say every few hours I mean that was about the time it took us from start to finish to complete our experience.  Not a positive.  After being seated we glanced the prefixed menu, which we had already decided upon and waited.  Then we waited, and waited, and waited some more.  Our waiter finally appeared, not sure what took him so long, but he seemed stressed.  We ordered drinks wine for me French Martini for the H, and immediately put in our order.  I requested the escargot and asked about the Boeuf Bourguignon which was one of the options for the entree the other was salmon.  Our waiter immediately began pushing this lamb special they were having.  He stated he would not order that and he didn't like it.  Compared it to a well done stew.  Um ok.. I said what about the salmon?  He said that was better than the beef but still not one of his favorites and wouldn't suggest it, but he said the sauce was really good.  What the heck?  He was pushing the regular menu and or the special, even stated the food on the menu was much better than the not so cheap $45.00 prefixed meals.  . We didn't allow this to alter our intentions of ordering off the restaurant week menu but I did decide to go with the salmon over the beef.  We both got the goat cheese salad for the appetizer, H went for the beef regardless of the waiters disdain for it, and I got creme brulee and he chocolate mousse.  To the most annoying part. The wait!  We waited for everything!  Our initial drinks took 15 minutes and when done  we waited forever with empty glasses.  The best part is I pushed the glasses to the edge of the table as to be noticed easily as our waiter passed several times, yet he did not stop to address it.  No actually he sped up as to avoid us calling him out as he dashed past our table.  I would have considered them moderately busy, not hustling past tables that are in need of drinks busy!  So we probably waited about 15 minutes before he finally stopped to get us a refill.  The refill process wasn't quick either, and we noticed that the servers made their own drinks.  Hmmm in a management perspective I think this is a bad idea.  But hey if it works for them, which it don't, then oh well.  He brings the drinks and in the process of setting them down he catches the H's on the tacky white paper covering the table cloth and spills a good sip or two of his martini.  The waiter blames the spill on said paper and says the next one's on me.    At least 30 more minutes, and still nothing. We came hungry this wait was excessive.  About 45 minutes in we got some bread and he dropped off a complimentary bowl of zucchini foam, quite tasty.  An hour in and finally my escargot show up.  H wouldn't even consider trying these puppies and good thing cause they were tiny.  They were quite good, but drowned in butter, garlic, and parsley that that was the primary flavor so I can only describe the escargot texture like a portabella.  Again very good, just wonder what they would have tasted like without all the disguisers.      Hour and 15 in, salads show.  I have never waited so long for a side salad, yet it was quite delectable.  The goat cheese mixed with the fresh veggies and delicate dressing made a very well balanced salad.  The problem, it was a small portion so we ate it in less than 5 minutes leaving us hungry and waiting for entrees.  So another 35 minutes pass and they show up.  The H really liked his beef so I am glad the waiter didn't deter his opinion, however it held the same challenge as the previous courses.  Small, tiny, teeny, itsy bitsy.  My meal held a little more bang for your buck.  The salmon was done nicely, though this sauce that was spoken of was hardly apparent.  The rice and asparagus that accompanied the dish were perfectly cooked.  In the course of eating again we were out of drinks and the empty glasses again sat at the edge of the table, where I would learn they would spend the rest of the night since he hustled past plenty of times without stopping.  Our final course desert arrived, Tasty we both enjoyed.  So in the end would I go again.  Unfortunately probably not.  The food was quite flavorful, but the portions do not represent the price tag, and being dodged for drinks in the almost 3 hours we were there was frustrating.  I would think that would be a no brainer, hello we want wine and cocktails, we drink more your tip goes up, sadly no.",

This is the best omelet I have ever had and I don't know why. It's just salmon,  spinach, and Swiss cheese but it's incredibly good.  It must have something to do with how the ingredients were prepared and how the omelet was cooked. I cannot replicate this dish.\"  I've been here several times and the food has always been excellent,  interesting, and worth the calories. They also have a great wine list.   **Do not come here if you're tight on time!  This is a casual little French cafe with a tiny kitchen that prepares all dishes from scratch when ordered. Nothing is prepackaged or frozen; therefore, it takes more time for the entrees to arrive than it does at most restaurants. As long as you are expecting this,  you will probably have a great experience (besides,  it's an excellent excuse to have an extra glass of wine).",

    "text": "After reading some of the recent reviews I had great expectations for my dining experience at Paris 66.  Sadly, I walked away feeling like I had wasted my money.  The dining room was extremely hot.  The air conditioning was clearly not working and it was well over 80 degrees in the room.  The service was very slow and the food was underwhelming.  I had the ahi tuna with mango appetizer and there didn't appear to have been any sauce whatsoever.  Just chunks of tuna and pieces of mango.  Nothing to bring cohesiveness to the dish.  I'd requested a glass of wine with my entree, but after a while I asked my server for the wine anyway.  I also asked to be reseated in the outdoor section because the room was so sweltering that I was fast losing my appetite.    After asking a second time, my wine was brought to me, along with a small plate of cheese and sausage.  That cheese was the highlight of the evening.  But it did not make up for the shrimp and linguini that was my entree.  The menu said it came in a white wine sauce, but I could not tell because whatever sauce they used was very thick and cloying.  I was not able to eat but a few bites.  The service was so slow that evening that I noticed several tables being offered a dessert on the house as an apology.    I'm very disappointed in my experience as it was my last night in town and I chose Paris 66 over about 20 other restaurants I'd researched.  It cost more than I would normally spend for myself but I thought it would be a nice way to end my vacation.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

I woudn't particularly recommend sitting in the tented back patio in the winter if you can avoid, but they do try their best with the space heaters, and they would totally do the trick if they didn't have people coming in and out of the back door.  Overall, the setting is a step up from Crepes Parisiennes on Filbert, but that's what you're paying for, the setting, the service and a fuller menu.  Their crepes are not better and are overpriced in comparison to the aforementioned place, but their Plats Principaux are far from flavorless and owners really seemed to make an effort to work the room, at least whenever I've been there.  If you're a seafood lover like moi, try the Crevettes Provencales, the last time I had it I could not get over how they cooked the shrimp to perfection, a task not often completed around these parts. Just don't bother with the crepes here and it's a really great menu.",

The night we were there it was perfect, and in my one stop back there to pick up pastries they were a bit backed up and alas could not fill my order.  No worries though, onto the review.  I normally don't comment upon a single dining experience BUT I have read some of the comments below and felt it only fair to weigh in for the owners/chef's sake.  It is a quite charming little place, with a lot more tables inside than you think are possible from the outside.  It is not a bit loud though, and appears all in the world like a quaint Paris Bistro.   For me, the key elements of the experience were:  Food:  Was extremely happy with the Steak Frites.  Perfectly done, I must admit it was better than the version that I actually had in Paris.   Everything was solid and spot on, the macaroons are to die for.     Service:  Absolutely rock solid the night we were there for dinner.   No complaints and even though our server had an injured thumb, you would not know it by here ability to open our wine and otherwise provide a high level of service (sadly something I see less often here in Pittsburgh).    Drink:  Wine list was pretty solid and rather fairly priced.  Again, one dinner is no real judge but I will be back to update.     Wildcard:  The bakery is a stunning addition and as noted above, macaroons are worth the price of admission.    You will not be sorry that you went.",

Come prepared to shell out a bit of cash for breakfast at least. I think they are slightly over priced for the portion. Perhaps that is just my perspective. And no, I am not cheap. I shop at WF's nuff said =)  We were seated in the sun room. May I make a suggestion. Never, ever let them sit you close to the plastic screen. The last thing I wanted to do but a few brief sips of coffee into my day, let alone birthday, was to be blinded (and I do me blinded) by the sun. I'm talking, full out squinting. There was no room for me to move my chair to avoid it. I had a table directly behind me. It was beyond awkward. Putting my inability to open my eyes behind me, the food made up that enlightening experience.  My husband and I both ordered the Paris 66 breakfast special. Delicious. They choose La Prima for their coffee source (smart move its the best in our town, hands down). The berry compote they serve along side their crapes is only sweet and tangy. The crape was moist and delicate- with fresh cream oozing out the sides as you slide the utensils within. Oh my goodness, love love love it. The eggs were amazing- eggs a la provencale.  Never had them this style and I will make sure to order them again. The fresh bread choices one gets with this offering are scrumptious. Fresh, buttery, flaky, and warm! I choose the chocolate au pain and sampled my husband's croissant. Just writing about them makes me want to pick up some this morning!  I also took home a nice selection of macaroons. I was in heaven. I feel I cannot eat anyone else's ever again. As theirs were 100% perfect in every way, shape, and form.   Update: Love this place. I went back twice since writing this review! I did not have a good experience with the dinner. To my recollection, they hired a new chef and management was very kind and purchased my dessert since we waited 1 hour and 45 minutes for our meals that were overcooked. The seriousness the manager took in our discomfort made me never think a negative thing about this place and I went back twice for breakfast. This place knows how to run a business, help out their staff when they are busy, and treats customers well. I cannot say enough nice things about this establishment! I do not mind if a meal isn't perfect- I can overlook it when the service and management are complete professionals about it. Thank you!",

Each of our party of 5 enjoyed well-prepared entrees, found a wine to his/her liking, never felt rushed and loved that our French waitress, Marie, indulged in banter en francaise with great good humor, letting us believe that our bad college French was better than i'm sure it actually was.",

    "text": "I was brought here for brunch by my daughter and husband yesterday for my birthday.  I've been several times for dinner and have always enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  Yesterday however, we had Mary as our server.  She was not interested in doing her job, she wanted to spend her morning talking with the hostess. She brought us our coffee, without cream or spoons.  When we asked for them she seemed put out. We got our food in less that 5 minutes, which is never a good sign that it's made fresh.  We all order the Paris 66 brunch.  The eggs were scrambled, and cold, not provencal, the croissant was stale and the crepe had redi-whip in it with no berries.  We tried to get her attention to ask her about the breakfast, but she never returned to our table, so we ate the food.  My husband tried numerous times to get a refill on his coffee, without luck.  When she came over to take our places away, I told her that the meal wasn't to our liking and she thought I was kidding.  When she realized I wasn't she became rude and gave us our check.  She did say sorry, but she wasn't.  She never acknowledged my birthday, never sent anyone to the table to ask us what was wrong, and totally ruined by birthday brunch.   I will never return here for brunch, I may go back for dinner, but skip this place for brunch if you want good food and service!!!!",

    "text": "Had friends for dinner there last night.  I mean. . . we ate dinner together with friends, we didn't eat our friends.  Who does that?  We hadn't really done French food in Pittsburgh, so this seemed like a nice switch.  It was good.  It wasn't great, but it was definitely worth a second visit.  The waitress was cute (not attractive cute. . . I mean. . . I'm not saying she wasn't attractive, I just mean she had a cute personality) and indulged our ridiculousness nicely.    Dinner was slow-paced but that suited us.  We were in it for the long haul.  We got a couple appetizers:  artichokes and mussels.  They were both great.    We ordered a bottle of wine and were completely clueless about the selections because, of course, they're all french and we knew nothing about french wines.    Our friend spilled his wine and the waitress apologized and asked if everything was okay.  I like that.  I like knowing that if my friend spills his wine that someone else will step in and say they're sorry even though it was all his fault.  Excellent work.  So then we cleaned him up and the table too (although they line the tables with paper table cloths, so that wasn't a huge problem.) and ordered our meals.  I asked the waitress to tell me what the Frenchest thing on the menu was.  She said, \"I don't know how to answer that.\" but then did pick something named for Marseilles, which despite being a city in France did not SEEM like the Frenchest thing on the menu.  Since escargot wasn't listed as an entree, and they didn't have rabbit. . . I ordered something else.  I got two specials, which isn't particularly instructive to potential NEW diners because they probably won't be on the menu when you dine there BUT. . .   I got the fig salad, and a softshell crab entree.  The fig salad was spectacular.  I couldn't have loved it more if I were twins.  Really. . . is lame as this sounds, I'll go out on a limb and say it was the best salad I've had in my life:  carmelized figs with romaine lettuce in white balsamic vinaigrette with soft blue cheese and candied walnuts. . . it really was great.  The softshell crab. . . not so much.  Very tough, very crunchy.  I had to request a steak knife to get through it.  It tasted good, just a little rough.  We finished off the evening with dessert, macaroons and creme brulee.  Only they spelled it macarons, because apparently the French spell everything differently than we do.    They have a bajillion different flavors of macarons.  I ordered a caramel and sea salt macaron.  It was pretty great.  The creme brulee was yummy too.    We had some nice strong coffee, paid and were out the door.  The bill was spendy. . . take away the wine and it was still on the high side.  It's hard to order a salad that costs as much as entrees do at other places, BUT. . . it WAS the best salad I've ever had IN. MAH. LIFE.  So that counts for something.  All in all, I'd go back again, especially if they added rabbit to the menu.",

    "text": "Romantic and authentic for a price.  My experience at Paris 66 Bistro was good but, because the cost for a three course meal was around $40 a plate, I'm going to rate this restaurant with a MUCH more stringent rubric. The atmosphere feels very much like a french bistro. It's romantic and quiet but some of the decorations were a little too much. There are a lot of antique photographs that but made me feel like I was in a b-list horror movie. Luckily the dishes were beautiful enough to cover this.  The food was good but not spectacular. I was most pleased with our cheese plate appetizer and macaroon dessert. The veal medallions I ordered were incredibly bland and the white wine sauce seemed a touch too bitter next to a pile of asparagus. Good service and fresh ingredients made this out to be an A-OK experience, though I would recommend skipping the main course.",

    "text": "Saturday evening, my Wife and I had the pleasure of eating at Paris 66. It had been a long week and we deserved something special. I knew we had made the right choice when I called to make sure I could get reservations and Stephanie was pleasant and efficient and said she could fit us in. Upon arriving, everyone greeted us with smiles and Bon Jours. We were led to a lovely table for 2. My wife started with the Crevettes flambes a l'anis. The shrimp was dome perfectly and the touch of star anise complimented it well, without being overwhelming.  I had the foie gras. It was tender and flavorful, but the fig bread and onion jam that accompanied it almost stole the show. Next the waiter brought a palate cleanser, which was zucchini foam that left us licking our lips and trying to figure out all of the flavors so that we might have some hope of duplicating this shot of deliciousness at home. For entrees, the wife opted for the Steak-Frites, which was cooked exactly medium rare. The bearnaise was silky and brought out the natural flavors of the steak. I had been recommended the Boeuf Bourguignon, and while I was reluctant to have something as simple as pot roast when there were so many adventurous options to choose from, it was the owner himself who recommended it. I figured who would know better than him. I am glad I listened. It is amazing how a masterful chef can take and elevate something simple into something so memorable. You could see the attention to detail in everything; even the potatoes were sculpted identically so they would cook equally.  To accompany our entrees, we split and order of Cauliflower Gratin which was delicate addition to our meal. A sort of \"whisper of flavors\" that you would pause to eat slowly to make sure you didn't miss anything. As we sat there discussing everything we had just eaten, we both realized how comfortable we felt. We hadn't even noticed how warm and welcoming the space was. We felt like we had been transported somewhere else and had been welcomed with open arms. Watching the families dine around us, it felt like we were regulars who had been visiting for years. We just wished we had left room for dessert. Oh well, I am sure there will be a next time.",

This time for brunch before the Sunday Matinee at the opera, the last was a lunch with friends and their two five year-old children. Both experiences memorable. Paris 66 does very well what it sets out to do--provide the experience of a Parisian bistro. Well crafted, hearty, non-fussy fare dedicated to the memory of grand-mere. This recent brunch visit gave the four of us the chance to sample across the menu. Spinach and salmon omelette, two varieties of eggs Hollandaise, French toast with bananas. All were equally successful. Cafe au Lait served first in a small cup, and the second as requested in a larger bowl (perhaps later the full Parisian bowl, sans handle)!.",

    "text": "I like the concept, but the food is not great at this cute little bistro. We went when it first opened, and I resisted the urge to review them then, as I wanted to give them time to straighten out the kinks. They have done that to a certain extent...they've fixed the ventilation system, and the buckwheat crepes, which used to have a grainy, sandy texture to them, are much better. The fillings, however, are uninspired and not handled with care. I got the Dijon mustard chicken crepe, and the chicken was bone dry. The filling was not enough for the size of the crepe, and they also need to sauce them more. I prefer crepe fillings that are either more stew-like or have a sauce to finish them, and these are just a pile of ingredients on top of a crepe. The soup of the day was watermelon gazpacho, which would have been excellent had they not dumped in so much cayenne, which made it overly spicy and strangely one note.   We were sat near the open kitchen when we first went in, and the clanking of pots, pans and plates was just too much for me, so I asked if they could move us. They did, and it was a little better, but this is a noisy restaurant, due to its petite size and tile floors.",

I made a reservation online for later in the evening, and we arrived at the restaurant 5 minutes before our time. It took 10 minutes (and multiple staff passing us by) before anyone acknowledged our presence at the hostess-stand. After finally being acknowledged and seated, it took another 20 minutes before we got water and our waiter came to get our drink orders. You think we would have left at this point, but it was 830, and we were hungry.  After putting in our drinks, appetizers, and dinner (weren't going to wait another moment to get our orders in), we enjoyed wine and french beer and the bread. Escargot came out in a reasonable time and was delicious. We split the mussels and enjoyed them tremendously. From there, things were looking up.... until it took another hour to get our entrees. My fiance's tuna was delicious. My duck... disgusting. The thing was soooo heavily salted I could barely eat it. And I LOVE salt. Instead of waiting and trying to order something else (our waiter hadn't even checked to see how are meals were after dropping them off) we decided to cut our losses and leave. Another 40 minute wait for the check. To try and make up for the waiting around, we got comped for 2 macaroons. REALLY?!?!?! That's like a slap in the face. Spending $150 to receive awful service, okay (but not worth $150) food for that? I would've gone back despite the duck, but will never go back because of the service. Get your act together, Paris 66.",

First of all, you would never have been alerted that it was restaurant week unless you made a point of knowing about it. There was just a tiny sign at the front podium listing the specials, no menu insert.  The restaurant week specials turned out to be quite boring, so we did not even select them. I started with the Soupe a l'oignon (delicious french onion soup) and then had the Roquefort Moules-Frites. The mussels had a wonderful flavor, but needed cleaning badly. They were distractingly sandy/gritty. The wine was over-priced, so I just had a single cocktail.  My husband started with Tarte Flambee Alsacienne - Flammekueche, which was fine. Then he had Magret de Canard, which was also fine.  Service was a bit slow, atmosphere was ok - kind of cramped, food was fine, but not as good as expected.  I would probably try the french place across the street before ever going back to Paris 66 again.",

The waitress was nice and attentive and the setting was adorable.  My friend ordered red wine (don't remember which) and I got French coffee. Her wine was delicious and my coffee had me drunk just from smelling it. It contained cognac, espresso, and cream on top. The cream was perfect though I couldn't even get halfway through my coffee because the cognac was way too strong for me at 12pm on a Monday.  I ordered La Champs de Mars, which is smoked salmon, creme fraiche, and dill on top of a buckwheat crepe. I wasn't having it with the buckwheat at all. I did not like it. It tasted very bland and kind of dry. This is a great option for people who like it or who need to go gluten-free, but it was definitely not for me. I didn't enjoy my meal because of this. The waitress mentioned savory crepes after we were done eating. They were on the dessert menu, but not anywhere on their website (or regular menu) as an option except as part of the brunch menu. I understand I could have asked about them before ordering, but I also wish the waitress had mentioned them as something to have other than buckwheat.  Even though I didn't like the buckwheat crepe, I still would like to come back and try a savory one instead since now I know how all of this works. I did try their chocolate mousse and it was really, really good. It was thicker and so chocolate-y, but not overpowering in the sweet department.",

    "text": "Bistro fare at 5-star Michelin prices.  I would love to give Paris 66 a higher rating, but the outrageous prices preclude that.  My partner and I went there for lunch.  If you look on the website, there is practically no difference between the lunch and dinner menus in terms of selection or prices.  Nor are there any type of \"lunch\" specials. So not wanting to fill up too much at lunch we both ordered the crepes.  I got the Paris 66 (ham, egg, cheese,etc) and my partner the salmon.  Both were very delicious.  But in no universe should a crepe cost $18!  In Paris it is no where near this expensive for crepes at any table service restaurant.  The price for our two crepes, tap water to drink and one macaron for desert with tip was close to $50!  Perusing the wine list was equally crazy.  Only a few selections under $50 and those were in the $45-$50 range.  Paris 66 would be outstanding if it followed through as a True bistro and not totally price gauge the customers.  Start by offering some True lunch offerings, and not charging a totally ridiculous price for crepes.  And if you want to charge these high prices, follow through and be like a Michelin starred restaurant and provide the matching service, white table clothes, etc. This place could be so much better.",

Granted I was only there once and for a late lunch.   But the tuna nicoise salad had the freshest delicate anchois (anchovies) as I eat in the South of France every summer. I am hooked!   A delicate glass of Sancerre and the nicest servers topped off my experience.   Some may say it is expensive, I do agree for lunch it's quite a price. But I didn't eat for dinner as it was really huge salad -- that's probably the only American thing about this place!",

The walls are filled with vintage posters and the chef is conversing with the waiters in French.  My parents and I stopped by for a late lunch around 4pm and were the only patrons. The waitress shared the specials and the menu has a huge variety from savory crepes, quiches, salads, sandwiches, or steak with frites. We ordered the La Trois Fromage with egg, Croque Madame, and La Tartine Savoyarde. Both of my parents said about their dishes of the La Trois, \"the right way to make a buckwheat crepes\" and the La Tartine, \"this raclette reminds me of our trip to Switzerland\". My Croque was simple, not overly buttered, and would be great option for brunch.   To finish off our meal of course we had our minds on those macarons! We each had an espresso and shared a six variety from the waittress's selections. Excellent.   Paris 66 needs more credit than the stars averaged here on Yelp. Give it a chance and you too will fall in love. Il est un delice!",

He was great at knowing what we needed and when we asked, he would be right back out with it.  Food: The moules-Frite were okay. The fries were perfect but the mussels were lacking. The escargot was amazing, as was the beef bourginon. The creme brulee was okay, I think the chocolate mousse was better.  Cocktails: They were great! Definitely recommend the French Manhattan.

We'll be dreaming about the quail for a while. The service was perfect -- this was (intentionally) not a rushed dinner, but a True French multi-course meal over four hours.

I honestly can't recall the last time I had a filet that tender & tasty. The deserts were equally pleasing. So you're probably wondering why only 4 stars. Well, for two people to eat with a few drinks expect to spend $300 or more. Had the prices been a bit more reasonable then Paris 66 gets the 5th *.

The eggs provencale were very flavorful with the stewed tomatoes and blue cheese.  The crepe was excellent, with it's slightly sweet cream and the berry puree.  It was really great. The chocolate croissant was meh ~ I've had much better at other places.  I also got the creme brulee for dessert which was so rich and delicious. The caramelized sugar on top was the perfect thickness and the perfect crunch. My friend got the Belgian chocolate mousse and I really thought I died and went to heaven when I tried it. It was everything I dreamed it would be.  I also wanted to try their macaroons, but they just get them delivered from Gabe et Jules. This was both disappointing and exciting. Disappointing because I would have loved to try them from somewhere new, but exciting because Gabe et Jules is my favorite spot for macaroons.  I will definitely go back. They had a lot of specials I would have loved to try. Smoked salmon eggs Benedict is most certainly next on the list.",

On the same day, we went to two different places:  Penn Brewery on the North Side, and this place.  In the first place, we had bratwurst and hand-crafted beer.  We had our fill.  Later, we were with some friends and checked in for a late-evening stop.  What we got was crepes (thin pancakes laced with some filling) and ended up paying almost the same as the previous restaurant.

I appreciated being told this before we were seated so that we could decide before getting settled whether we wanted to stay and wait. We decided to go for it since we weren't in a rush.   We ended up ordering (homemade) croissants and (homemade) jams as an \"appetizer\" to tide us over while waiting for the food. Since those things were pre-made on site, we were served them immediately. They were DELICIOUS!  Aside from the slow-to-come out food, the service otherwise also was a bit slow (ie, the waitress). She could have been more attentive given that we were being so patient and there for such a long time.   As for the food when it did come out: Two of us got savory crepes and one got a sweet crepe. We were all extremely pleased with the quality and tastiness of the food. We each cleaned our plates and noted that we'd be back. The French ambiance is really well done, too.  It seems that Paris 66 was not prepared for its own popularity and is experiencing some growing pains as it gets the pacing of its service correct. I hope they will learn from the foibles of their first few weeks. We will definitely be back!!",

The place is bigger than it appears from the outside and we were seated promptly (they don't accept reservations so we were concerned about having to wait).  The staff was very friendly although I found their intermittent use of French buzz-words a little heavy handed.  We decided to split a hummus appetizer, served with chips.  It was quite good, and the portion was big enough to necessitate a chip refill.  For our entrees, I opted for the Versailles crepe while my boyfriend chose a savory crepe (I don't recall the name but it had mozzarella, basil, and tomato in it).  He was pretty disappointed with his.  I tried a bite and agreed: with those ingredients I expected something light and refreshing but it all tasted very heavy.  The cheese didn't seem to be of very good quality and even the crepe itself tasted kind of dull and dense.  My crepe on the other hand was awesome; it had just a bit of butter and sugar on top and was sweet, but not too sweet -- just what I was craving.  We both also had soup with our meals, boyfriend had the soup of the day which was cauliflower and chevre (not bad, but cauliflower's not really my thing) and I had the onion soup (quite tasty).  From our experiences, it seems like Paris 66 can be pretty hit or miss.  However, even though my meal was consistently enjoyable, after eating every bit of it I still didn't feel all that full.  I have a notoriously small appetite, so this is really saying something.  I'd probably go back, but next time it would be for brunch or dessert, not a major meal.",

First impression: the decor was cute, the pastries smelled great, and the staff was friendly.  My wife ended up ordering french toast, and I got a vegetarian savory crepe.  We were both disappointed when the food came out- her french toast was literally ONE piece of bread cut into three small pieces. My crepe was a plain crepe topped with a pile of mixed greens with raisins, sundried tomatoes and walnuts on top.  Her french toast was great, but was gone within about two minutes. My crepe was disgusting.  The crepe itself was bland, some of the lettuce was wilted and slimy, and the herb sour cream dressing mixed horribly with the sweet raisins. I guess I should've read the menu more carefully, but seriously, even if this type of dish was what i wanted, the flavors were all wrong.  I should mention that the service was decent, and my chai latte was great.  Bottom line, when we left we were still hungry and considered stopping at Pamela's.  We won't be back, even though we really wanted to like this place..",

However, when he arrived he was charming and pleasant (though a French restaurant would not say something is served \"with au jus\" anymore than they'd think that \"a la mode\" means with ice cream - sloppy, when it's owned and run by genuine French) The atmosphere reminded us of genuine French bistros, as did the food. Servings are smaller than American, so instead of being overfaced and given a doggy bag, we were able to indulge in desserts as well as starters and mains. The French onion soup was OK, salads nice and fresh - but all were served at the same time, as well as mains. By the time the guys had eaten the soups and the salads (girls only had one) the mains were cooling. Crepes and piisaladiere were good - no problem with leeks as mentioned elsewhere. The creme brulee was exactly as you'd expect but the Paris 66 crepe - similar to a crepe Suzanne - should have been impressively flambeed. The evening was still light, there was a slight breeze outside and the Grand Marnier hadn't been warmed, so it wasn't properly flambeed. However, we all four have eaten often in France and felt this was a nice authentic little bistro, and felt very welcome. We will be back there soon.",

    "text": "This is a great new addition to the blossoming food scene of E. Liberty.  I was a bit tentative at first after having been very excited to try this place out, based on a couple mixed reviews on this site as well as some other input from family.  I can only speak to my experience and it was close to perfect.  Annie and I had lunch here today on a cool summer/fall day.  This place is very \"yelpy\" (refer to my penn ave. fish company review for a definition).  The space itself is pretty close to perfect.  It's located a few storefronts down from kelly's and when you walk in you are very much transported to a french bistro.  You are greeted warmly by the chef or should I say \"Master Crepe Chef\" (actually a title) who is behind the small cooking area to the right.  The colors are very warm and the detail is impressive down to the french clocks and pictures on the walls.  The space seats probably about 30+ inside and there is a wonderful little deck in the back with four to five tables and a small garden.  One of the other details I appreciate is that each table has its own pitcher of water (just like in France).  They sell pastry in the front on your way in or out.  The hostess was very friendly and the staff was top notch from start to finish even though we got there close to closinf time.  In fact, I was very impressed with how pleasant everyone was given the fact that they were closing for lunch.  THe chef is from france and just about everyone who works there speaks french as well.  The owner Fred Rongier is also 100% French (Btw, Fred also sold me my car and it was the only time in my life that I actually felt good after buying a car).  I see he applies the same service attitude to this place.  Another thing which  I really like about this place is that it is the only French restaurant that I'm aware of around Pittsburgh that is inexpensive.  This is a crepe restaurant, however they do serve a feature each evening that is more of an entree' type selection and once a month they do a gourmet dinner that is reservation only.  Okay, onto the food.  I ordered a delicious \"Le St. Germain\", which is a ham and swiss cheese buckwheat crepe.  I also added an egg.  The crepe was thin and even and very tasty.  The cheese was generous and the ham was a very good quality and tasty.  My only small complaint is that it would have been better if the egg was runny and not fried.  It was served with a cup of soup.  I had the pea soup which had a very layered and complex taste, perfectly seasoned with a ton of peas and not overwhelming with the cream.  The only small issue is that it could have been served a little hotter.  Annie ordered one of the best sandwiches I can recall eating maybe ever.  It was the \"croque monsier\" which again is basically a ham and cheese sandwich, but it was overflowing with delicious swiss cheese and crispy bread perfectly warm and with cheese on the outside that was a bit crispy (burnt in a good way). She also had the french onion soup which actually isn't that french at all and you'd have a hard time finding \"french onion\" soup in France.  However, this was top notch french onion soup served in a small crock with a lot of cheese (again burnt in a good way) and a rich, deep onion broth.  We both finished with a nice light Versailles Crepe served simply with butter and a little sugar.  THe perfect dessert.  A couple other small points... I had a delicious cafe au' lait.  This is a True espresso bar.  THe server was very pleasant and professional throughout.   I look forwarded to coming back again and I think this may become a regular stop for me and Annie.",

Wait staff was harried and showing it. I felt their stress which did not make for a relaxing lunch. I had to get up from my table twice to track down our waitress. Not once did she check in to see if we needed anything.  I wish it had been a better experience but for a $17 Salad Nicoise I don't feel like putting up with the restaurants shortcomings.  Bummer.

I asked if the ingredients were fresh or canned and the very rude waitress who reminded me this was the \"French way\" more than 5 times, admitted to using canned corn and canned beets. I expressed I was not interested in the salad and didn't want anything else. However, when the bill came my salad that I did not eat & was taken away was still on the check. I asked to speak with the manger who was more disgraceful than the waitress, explained that was my mistake for ordering it. My nana, who was treating me to lunch paid for it anyway. We proceeded to leave when the manager CAME OUTSIDE AFTER US YELLING, \"no tip? You left no tip!\" You should be ashamed of yourself. In France, this is shameful!\" He began pointing his finger in my face, while I was holding my baby. If I were a man or with a man, I'm sure this wouldn't have happened. DONT EAT HERE. To treat a customer so terribly is TERRIBLE, AWFUL AND DISGRACEFUL",

I ordered one of their sandwiches and it really takes you to place far far away at times.  That could be because i m so used to the food from where i live, which consists of basically Quiznos and Subway.  Point is that it is nice to eat a a real restaurant for once and it is nice to eat some French food that is not massively expensive for once.  The one thing that sucks here is parking but its not really that bad cuz the restaurant is not overly huge and massively busy, at least when we went.  If you like French food though you should totally check it out for lunch.",

Dessert crepe was okay but overpriced, and service was pretty average.

Many other customers were unhappy the last 3 times we went. I don't complian but paying over 120$ for two ppl (we dont drink) at dinner I expect more. The one male waiter is very rude. Unfortunately he has waited on me the past 3 times. He acts pretentious.  We were sitting next to 3 elderly woman. One of the woman said she just turned 92. They asked for the checks to be split up and the waiter refused to split the check! Seriously it would take 2 min but he just kept telling the woman no. They were very upset. I was upset for them. I think Paris 66 should try to be nicer to there customers and also turn down the AC! The last two times I ate here I was worried the food was bad concidering the table of men next to us and my husband and waiters/waitresses were all sweating! Deserts are what they should focus on because they make some good ones! I gave this restaurant 4-5 chances before I wrote a bad review. I feel awful but I feel like after so many failed attempts I should let others know!  Maybe I just go at the wrong days/times.",

    "text": "We went here Friday night and had fairly high expectations for Paris 66. I was looking forward to a decent crepe!  We were immediately greeted by one of the owners in the cramped entry. She advised that our wait would be approximately 30 minutes, although she mentioned that she hadn't been in the back for awhile and didn't know what was going on back there. She did take our phone number and said she would called us. Great! We wandered around nearby businesses. Fine. We went back 30 minutes later, being very optimistic. When we arrived, we saw that our position on their notepad, (yes, they have a very sophisticated way of tracking their wait list), had not changed. So, either no one had come in since we were last there, or they had been seating customers as they came in. We were told by a different host that our wait would be just 30 minutes. When we explained that we were told that 30 minutes ago, she became flustered and said we would be seated as soon as possible. So, this time, we decided to wait in the cramped entry next to the glass display case looking at yummy food.   Now let me say, they have made great use of the space in these very confined quarters. The kitchen is right inside the front door, (you can see crepes being made outside thru the front window), the chef and cooks are bursting with energy, working at a hectic pace to prepare the orders. They are warm and friendly and greet all the customer. A cash register is also located here, along with the dessert case. Tables are small and packed close together. Walls have a weathered finish, the lighting thru out is ambient, the fixtures are beautiful, all the walls are covered with old fashioned posters, post cards are under glass on the tables. Very nice. The exterior and interior finishes are very, very nice.   We were offered a dining room table or a table on the patio. We happily took the patio, the fresh air was very nice after waiting by the kitchen. Not a lot to look at outside, but it's very relaxing there. We got a nice table in the corner next to large pot of flowers.   Service was sub par. Our server waffled between her fake accent and Yinzer girl. Okay. We were not offered a beverage. She wasn't well rehearsed on the menu, except to say \"we are out of that\" twice. We also noticed that she struggled to open the wine of customers that BYOB'ed. Another thing that seemed odd was, mid way thru our dinner, one of the owners came busting out the back door with a table. She placed it in the middle of the patio, a server came out with a high chair, they moved it around a couple times and then customers came outside packing their own meals and then stood around and then decided to find their own chairs. Kinda strange.   I ordered La St Germain, a buckwheat crepe with ham & swiss served with a small side salad. I thought it was a bit tough and dry and couldn't eat more than 1/2 of it. Also, it was contained very little ham or swiss, however the salad was nice. BJ had Paris-Brest, a salad served with scallops, shrimp, mussels and pesto. The scallops, (only 2) were well prepared, the shrimp (4) were tiny but well seasoned and the mussels (4) were over cooked and very tough. It was supposed to be served with bread, but none found it's way to our table. BJ also had the carrot & vanilla soup, which was nice.   I so wanted a crepe for dessert, but after the savory crepe, I was afraid to try one of the sweets. Instead, we shared an apple tart. It was perfect, served with a bit of creme anglaise. The crust was very flaky, the apples were perfect. Our server gave us spoons to eat the tart, so that was a struggle.   I'm sure Paris 66 will do well in Pittsburgh and I wish them well. However, I was not at all impressed with our experience.",

First, the wrong main dish was delivered, and the correct entree arrived with soup not salad.  To make matters worse, the quiche crust was doughy across the entire bottom, and the \"ham\" was VERY fatty bacon.    The response from the waiter?  A shrugged sorry and \"do you want a side salad?\"  When the hostess came by, she, too, shrugged a \"sorry\" and grinned a bit sheepishly.  I finally asked for the manager.  When she arrived, she thanked us for the feedback and offered a free dessert.  I wasn't asking to have my butt kissed or get free food, but in any PROFESSIONAL restaurant, the server would have immediately offered to take the quiche off the bill.   Very poor service.  I had the monkfish.  Never had it before.  The server said that is was \"light and flaky.\"  Mine was dense and rubbery.    There are too many other good restaurants in Pittsburgh for me to bother with this place again.  Ugh.    Oh, and the french greetings and exclamations -- \"C'est magnifique?\" -- are a bit much.  The affectations were annoying.  Just give me good, friendly and honest service.",

    "text": "I've gone to Paris 66 twice now. The first time I went, it was soon after the restaurant opened. They were full, but not busy, and we got a table right away. We waited maybe 45 minutes and got half of the food we ordered. The rest of us just had to wait another maybe 30 minutes or so for the rest. The food was pretty good when it finally came out. Since the restaurant was new and the manager had been apologetic about the whole thing, I figured I'd give it another try.  I went again today with some friends. It took over an hour for our food. First we were told it was taking awhile because of some New Years Eve event they had planned later in the night (I wonder why they would open for lunch today if they thought they could not handle it. This is definitely not a valid excuse if you ask me).  Then the waiter came back and told us apparently the kitchen never got our order.  In the time it took for the waiter to realize he hadn't given the kitchen our order, they ran out of a component of one of the dishes as well (and note that my friend was incorrectly charged a dollar more for the original thing he ordered instead of the replacement dish he received..) When we finally got our food, there were a couple of problems with it too. In addition to the food taking forever, the server wasn't very attentive to us either (didn't refill our water, didn't give a spoon for soup, etc).  Even replacing a salad (brought it out w/wrong dressing) took 5-10 minutes.  I will DEFINITELY not be going back to this restaurant. While the food is actually pretty good (though I'm sure it would taste better warm), the service has been pretty terrible both times I've been there.",

    "text": "Been here twice in the past year, once today for brunch and once last fall (2009) for dinner. Both times, the food was good but the service was really slow.   Lots of yummy-looking items on the menu. The egg provencale I had this morning was fabulous. Last time I was there at dinner, there was a soup that was amazing - I think it was a potato cream soup?  A few things I've had were a miss (I remember a pear-chocolate dessert, which was good but not really as nice as some other combination would have been) but I've also had some amazing food. Today, the breakfast crepe was delicious (beautiful sweet ham, plus an egg) but instead of their usual buckwheat crepes, they used a refined wheat flour crepe that was quite sweet - in my book, a bit too sweet for the savory ingredients, but still quite yummy.  A word about buckwheat crepes - most of the crepe dishes on the menu use buckwheat crepes instead of wheat flour crepes. If you're not used to or expecting buckwheat, you might be disappointed. Buckwheat adds a slightly tangy, sour taste, It's dryer than wheat crepes, and can sometimes have a gritty texture.   Service-wise, as I said, really slow. There are lots of people rushing around the small dining area but somehow you can never get a glass refilled or a check delivered without asking. I feel I'm always fighting for a little bit of attention from the waitstaff. The first time I was there we waited like 10-15 minutes to get our wine opened, while the four-person table seated after us got drinks ahead of us - this kind of thing makes my head want to explode. Making things worse, there seems to be a system where a separate person delivers food from the kitchen, so although you usually are guaranteed waitstaff attention then, I thought it would be inappropriate to use that interaction for a normal table staff request (like more water or another fork).  I think service could be much improved if they had a dedicated busser clearing tables and helping out refilling drinks and such.  We didn't have a wait today (just about 3 minutes while they cleared a table, plus about 6 minutes before the maitre d' came up to the front to notice we were there - also typical from last visit), and last fall we were pleasantly surprised by a shorter wait than they said (20-30 minutes).   So, if you're easily frustrated by slow and inattentive service you might want to go elsewhere, but if you can roll with it, the food is worthwhile.",

You get either soup or salad with it, and I opted for the ham and corn soup which was good.    I did not get to try any of the sweet crepes, but I saw people just coming in for desert.  They do have daily specials in addition to the crepes, but they were all sold-out by the time I arrived.  I highly recommend giving this place a try.",

I was the big spender, with a refreshing, blood orange flavored French soda, and a goat cheese, olive French pizza with a nice little side of hot French onion soup. The pizza was quite tasty and flavorful, with a buttery, flaky pastry crust.  The soup's bread topping was a little soggy, but warm and cheesy nonetheless. My fiance ordered espresso, which he said was better in quality than similar spots. He also ordered the Versailles crepe, which consisted of just butter and sugar.  He said it was delicious, though he was a bit disappointed in the relatively small selection of sweet crepes.   Our waiter, Jason, was friendly and capable. I really liked the decor of the restaurant, which has fairly limited seating. When crowded, however, it was quite noisy. The restaurant is BYOB, and I am planning on going back for dinner quite soon.",

She did not offer any explanation of the menu... curtly took our order, delivered the food, and disappeared... we had to ask another server to get us more coffee(our server finally came over, refilled our cups with tepid coffee - not without spilling it on the table without a whim); when our food came, our server never returned to ask if all was well - did we like the food - if there was anything else - questions we heard other servers in the bistro asking their customers; we were not surprised when the bill was delivered with a \"Here.\"( it was \"thudded\" onto the table (startling my sister-in-law backwards in her seat)... No matter the ethnicity, \"look\", etc. of customers, they are the bloodline of any business. . . Dear owners,  don't let any server sabotage your lovely business. . . We'll be back because of the friendly reception we received upon entering. . . however, next time, we'll ask for another waitress. . .  Good luck. . .",

    "text": "I went to Paris 66 for brunch with my wife and some friends, and it was really excellent. My brunch combination included eggs Provencal, pain au chocolat, and a crepe with whipped cream and a berry sauce -- very simple, but very well executed. My wife said that her buckwheat crepe was a bit too rich, but I'll let her write her own review if she wants to give Paris 66 fewer stars. Also notable are the macarons. Lots of different flavors and all of those I've tried (raspberry, pumpkin, caramel, and pistachio) have been between good and fantastic. Finally, the service was quite good: they were friendly, attentive, and indulged us when we were indecisive.",

    "text": "Went for New Years Eve.  My wife and I got the Prix Fixe menu which was $129 for four course meal.   I got the wine pairing for an additional $50.   Our bill,  after cocktails,  still water,  my wife's drinks with her meal, and the mandatory 20% gratuity was over  $500.     This was not a $500 experience.  The food portion for each meal course was extremely small.   I don't mind that so much if the food is exceptional,  however,  the food was merely above average.   I received a lobster bisque portion that would maybe fill half a teacup.   A seafood gratin portion that sounded great on the menu but was served inside half a medium clam shell.   Again,  my issue is with value.    The service was not worthy of 20% gratuity.  I found myself constantly having to pause my meal so I could track down my waitress for things ranging from more water,  to bread, to silverware, to another drink for my wife.   In many restaurants, as a party of two, you are often pushed to lower priority when parties of 4+ start arriving.  Sad to say that Paris 66 seems to be just such a place.      To sum up:  Food was slighty above average,  staff was friendly,  but the experience was not nearly worth $500+ and we wont be spending New Year's Eve there again.",

    "text": "We came in during graduation week and I was a little surprised that there was so many available time on the OpenTable app. When we came, the restaurant was almost empty. Which was a huge surprise since every other restaurants were booked up at least a week before because of graduation week. When we came, it took forever for the waiter to come and take our order. and when he took the order it takes 45 minutes for the main course to come out, 30 minutes for the appetizer to come out, and it took 20 minutes for the desserts to come out. The only time that service was quick was when they give us the check. We ordered the snail for appetizer and a salad, both were subpar especially the snail, doesn't have any flavor whatsoever to it. And the lamb shank which the waiter recommended to us was soft, however there are not much taste to it, and it doesn't have that special juicy taste that lamb usually has. The only high point of our meal was the creme brulee, which was very delicious. Everything from service to food was very disappointing, especially for that price point, the restaurant doesn't look particularly fancy either, I honestly think it's because they think they can charge more because it's French food. I have even gotten irritated towards the end because it took us 3 hours to finish our meal when it absolutely does not have to be that long. After 20 minuted of waiting, I walked up to the front to see the waiter chatting with some guests that are not yet seated, while our desert plates were just laid out on the counter. Mind you these are all premade, they literally just left it there for 20m for no reason, while we were tired and sleepy from jet lag. Not a good experience and I will never come back again.",

The waitress spoke English and French, so it added to the whole Paris experience. Everything happened on time and we wanted for nothing. If I remembered her name, I would give her a shout out, but thanks for the amazing service.  :=(  We generally have something minute to pick at, but nothing really can be said. Maybe the Lunch Main Courses are a little pricey, so those might not be for the college student on a budget or if your paycheck is at it's tailend. The prices are generally what you would expect, though. However, it would have been nice to have quality mains, at a lower price.  All in all, nice place!

I was immediately impressed by the interior which featured turn of the century (19th to 20th) touches, small, intimate niches and perfect lighting levels. The food.   The food was just wonderful.  My partner had an appetizer of the onion soup, an entree of salad Nicoise a glass of wine and lemon tart for dessert.  I opted for the small salad opener, the calves liver in balsamic reduction with mashed potatoes and a strawberry crepe for dessert.  Since my partner speaks fluent French, was spoken constantly with one of the owners and it was like being across the ocean at an actual Paris bistro.   I have read a few criticisms of this restaurant saying that it was pricey for \"bistro\" food.  Having recently been to Paris and my partner having lived there for a number of years, I went online to European Yelp and checked out the prices of Bistros in Paris.  Almost spot on!  Some items were a few dollars / Euros higher and some lower.  But they were overall comparable.  I found Paris 66 to be fantastique!!!",

    "text": "Paris 66.  Right when you walk in you'll hear the chefs shouting out for ingredients in strong French accents.  It's amazing.  On my first trip to Paris 66 I tried their Beef Bourguignon and it was pretty good.  I also tried their Quiche Lorraine and their French Pizza.  The quiche makes me happy.  Like so happy.  Finding a quiche place in Pittsburgh.  Om nom nom nom.  The pizza was eh; I'd never order it again.  On my second trip I decided to get their savory Paris 66 crepe (mushrooms, tomatoes, ham, and an over easy egg.  For a choice of soup or salad, I got their soup which was a cream base with cauliflower puree and a dash of paprika.  It was surprisingly hearty and I barely finished my crepe (my eating companion helped me out).  The crepes are definitely worth getting, but don't set your expectations too high b/c it's not like the ultimate crepe that exists.  I absolutely LOVE the decor.  When you're sitting inside you would never imagine that you're in Pittsburgh.  The outdoor seating is peaceful but there's not much to look   The last time I was there, we saw some prepped salads about to be sent to tables and they looked gorgeous.  I definitely want to try one next time.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to check out Paris 66 for several months now, after reading reviews in local newspapers.  I finally made it there for lunch last week, and I was pleasantly surprised.   I loved that when I walked in the chefs in the front were speaking French (and I assume they are french as well).  I enjoyed the time I spent in Paris several years ago, and was eager to take a stroll down memory lane.  We  were seated on the outdoor patio, and although it was a cold January day, the space heaters kept the area comfortably warm.   Our server was very helpful in making suggestions, and he was very attentive.   I remember the feeling I got when ordering in Paris, and that is how easy it is to mispronounce menu items.    I cannot remember the name of the dish I ordered, but it was a savory crepe with chicken, mushrooms, and mustard.  I got the cauliflower and goat cheese soup at the suggestion of our server, and loved it!  It was the perfect amount of food for a lunch, and at a great price as well!  I will be going again to check out a few more of their menu items!  **update:  For their dinner specials the escargot starter is out of this world!",

The inside can be noisy with a relatively open kitchen and people coming in to just buy pastries. I started with the salmon tartare which was excellent and the line sorbert paired perfectly with the salmon (excellent together in a single bite). The bread was freshly cut to serve at the table and the butter was creamy and decadent. This butter with the bread was some of the best that I've had. For main course, I had the mussels Roquefort style. The flavor of the blue cheese persisted in the cream and butter based broth. The mussels were huge and well prepared. The broth was so heavy that I had difficulty finishing the mussels, despite how good they were. We got 6 macaroons to go, which were excellent as well. The violet and lavender were among the best, while the strawberry was nothing special. I thought the salty caramel was the best of those that I tried.  This is a very good French restaurant and I would recommend to foodies that prefer to not have coleslaw and fries on top of all of their dishes.",

I mean, yeah, a French bistro that lines its walls with Art Nouveau posters is a little cliche. But being a huge fan of Art Nouveau and not going to French bistros very often, I couldn't care less. Overall, it is an unassumingly charming little place and apparently has a heated patio? Definitely a great little romantic date spot, low lighting and all! Our server was a little pretentious but nice and attentive, for the most part.  My friend got a crepe and she said it was \"pretty good\" but nothing to rave about. I got the Moules Frites Normande. The mussels were plump, and while I liked the broth, I felt like it could've used a little more...something. It was just kind of boring and bland. No bread was given to sop up the broth, either. The fries were not very good in my opinion, and did not come with any sort of dipping sauce. I tried dipping in the broth. Still not very good, and now soggy. Basically I just wish this place was Point Brugge? Or maybe I should have ordered something else and accepted that PB is without a doubt the Moules Frites champion of Pittsburgh, and I need to stop comparing everyone else against them. I can't help it!  Not knocking it off my list just yet! I need to come back to evaluate their crepes!",

The last time I went for dinner I had that evening's special, cassoulet.  It was too salty, not very hot, and just not very good.  For $25.00 I expected something much better.    The service is on par with the food.  As far as I could tell we were our waitress's only table yet we rarely saw her.  It took 15 minutes to get drinks, about 35-40 minutes to get entrees after we finished our appetizers, and after we were finished, about 25 minutes to get the check and leave.  We also noticed, while waiting for our entrees, that the other tables got baskets of bread with their appetizers.  When we asked the waitress about it it was clear she completely forgot and really didn't care.  As another reviewer said, this place seems like its trying a little too hard with theme park decor, overdone bonjours, and apparently, teaching the wait staff the French art of insouciance.   There are better options for French cuisine in the city, don't waste your time here.",

The food was authentic and prepared well and the macarons were the best I'd had anywhere (yes I think they're better than Laduree). The macarons still are the best, although you now have to buy them at Gaby et Jules in Squirrel Hill up the street. Anyway, the last couple of times I went here, once in early 2013 and now in early 2014 were just ok. The service and decor are awesome and very charming, but the quality of the food has really taken a dive. We all started with french onion soup which was very good and I would highly recommend, but all of the entrees were mediocre. Two of us ordered salads and the lettuce was wilted and didn't taste fresh. My husband had veal, which was cooked to the point that he could hardly cut or chew it. I had salmon that was so undercooked that I couldn't eat anything but the edges (I ordered it medium). I want to like Paris 66 so much and there's a ton of potential there, but they need to step up their food game. Charging $20+ for so-so entrees isn't going to fly for long.",

    "text": "My wife and I celebrated our 14th anniversary at Paris 66.  We were so happy that we chose this restaurant. We will remember this delightful experience for a very long time.   First, we were welcomed by the owners. After a very kind display of hospitality, they offered us any seat that was available. While inside the restaurant was lovely, we chose to sit on the back patio. It was a gorgeous evening and it made us feel like we were dining in Paris, not Pittsburgh.   After seating us, the owners introduced us to Marie-Lise and Renaud and explained they both would be serving us for our special event. Immediately, both Marie-Lise and Renaud paid extra special attention to us. Even though there was a Pittsburgh Steeler dining right next to us, my wife and I both felt like we were the celebrities.   I started off with a Canadian beer and my wife drank a glass of Kir, since she likes sweet wine. For an appetizer, we went with the scallops!  WOW!!  They were some of the biggest scallops I have ever been served. Not to mention, they were delicious!!!!  I also had the French Onion Soup, which was also very tasty.   For our main course, my wife went with the Filet. The portion was much larger than your typical filet at an upscale restaurant. More importantly, the filet was so very tasty and tender.  The mushroom sauce that accompanied it, made it even better. I chose to have the Lamb Shank and was delighted by my choice. It was a very large portion and the meat fell right off the bone. The sauce was very flavorful.   Even though we didn't have much of an appetite after devouring the apps and main entree, we couldn't pass on dessert. We considered the famous Gabby and Jules macaroons, but since we can pick them up at a few local bakeries and the Pittsburgh International Airport, we figured we would order something you can only get at the restaurant. My wife went with a Nutella and banana crepe, which again went along with the theme of the night, nice portion and delicious!  While I am a fan of Creme Brulee, Marie-Lise recommended I try a special desert made by the chef. I can't pronounce the name of it, but boy was it everything I wanted in a desert. It was basically a cream with a \"floating island\" of some type of meringue. I am so happy I chose this desert, as it put a very sweet ending to our lovely evening.   While we don't typically dine in the city, we will definitely be making another trip out in the foreseeable future and will highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great food, an extreme friendly and attentive staff, and a lovely atmosphere. Thank you to the owners, Marie-Lise and Renaud for making this a remarkable 14th anniversary dinner for us.  Merci! Frank and Kerri",

    "text": "After meaning to try Paris 66 for months and never quite getting there, my girlfriend and I finally made it as part of Pittsburgh restaurant week August 2019.  We made our reservation online, and arrived at what seemed liked a charming upscale bistro on a quiet Tuesday night.  The ambiance was nice, but the experience quickly and unfortunately took some bad turns.  We were greeted by our server with an enthusiastic \"bon soir\" within seconds of sitting down, but since we were obviously not ready to order in this time frame, she left and came back in about 10 minutes.  We asked her to recommend a bottle for us between 2 reds we had narrowed down, and her response was simply that she \"didn't really drink red wine\".  Red flag #1 for a restaurant of this supposed caliber, but fine.  It's a limited menu for restaurant week, so we just order 1 of everything.    First course - escargot and warm goat cheese salad.  I loved the salad, despite the goat cheese not actually being warm, it was sweet and very tasty.  The escargot was forgettable, essentially being drenched in pesto so you couldn't taste anything but the heavy green sauce.  Second course - this is where things got very, very bad.  We had the sea scallops and green peppercorn strip steak.  First, the scallop dish was really just overcooked pasta with lots of canned stewed tomatoes, with 3 previously frozen scallops placed on top.  It was not good, but it was edible.  It became dinner for both of us, and I will explain why: the strip steak.  The Steak was ordered medium rare, and came out looking like it had been placed in boiling water for a just a few seconds, with a totally un-seared soggy grey exterior and a dark red interior.  We sent it back, and it came back slightly more pink, but still with no sear.  The main issue with the steak though, was the texture.  Never in my life had I seen anything like it - the texture was similar to one of those cheap chunks of processed ham that groceries sell during the holidays, nothing like any other steak I've ever had.  We did not eat it, instead opting to take it home and feed it to our dogs, who to be fair, did seem to enjoy it.  Third course - creme brulee.  We ordered 2 creme brulees, and were served 1 creme brulee and 1 tarte.  No big deal, we just told our new server (the original server had disappeared midway through the meal) and she replaced it with the correct order.  Unfortunately, creme brulee #2 came out as if it had been microwaved, with a very soft top sugar layer and visibly broken cream.  The original was tasty, but the second was very bad.  Overall, Paris 66 has a nice ambiance, but we were 0/1 on the wine, 1/2 on the first course, 0/2 on the main course, and 1/2 on the desert.  In my view, this would ordinarily translate to a 2 star review.  However, the rudeness of the staff further detracted from the experience, so here we are at 1 star.  We asked about the steak, and were given the explanation that \"Yeah, I don't know why they would put a steak on the menu during restaurant week when it's going to be busy, and it's not the best quality\".  I have issues with this because a) it wasn't busy, and b) despite it being restaurant week, other restaurants (most recently Monterey Bay, for us) manage to deliver on a great meal and experience during restaurant week.  Paris 66 is in that lazy middle ground between being a fresh and trendy upstart, and being a well-established staple, with just enough name recognition to skate by on their reputation.  Unfortunately, this was a total disappointment and not an experience I would ever recommend.",

    "text": "If I could give this place a 6 stars, I would in a heartbeat! We had booked the back patio on a Saturday afternoon in June for an intimate wedding ceremony and brunch. Renaud and Marie Lise were absolutely delightful to work with and were very accommodating. They helped us plan the decorations, menu and seating arrangements for our group of 27. We were allowed to bring our own decorations and Renaud added some lovely finishing touches to our centrepieces. He also decorated the stairs to the back patio and heater pole with tulle and a bouquet. In addition they also prepared signage for our wedding party.   Renaud gave us such delicious options for brunch-the quiche, goat cheese salad, salmon crepe's and chicken gravy with pomme frites. We also had a croissant basket and for dessert crime brulee and chocolate mousse. Most of these food options were from their menu and I highly recommend that you try them if you find yourself at Paris 66.  I also want to mention that they also honoured special gluten free and dairy free requests for two guests. I imagine this is difficult for French cuisine, but Renaud was more than happy to help! Our guests were very happy with thr service and quality of food.  We are so grateful to have celebrated our special day with the Paris 66 crew. They were so patient with us and even allowed us to take photos inside the restaurant. We will definitely be back to celebrate an occasion!!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I visited Paris 66 for a date night on a Friday. We were very excited about the decor right when we walked in as it was cheerful and classy. Our waitress brought us to our table and explained the delicious-sounding specials in a thick French accent; we already felt like we had been transported from East Liberty to Paris.   We decided to order some PEI mussels to share and it was a delicious choice. The mussels were cooked well and had the perfect tender texture. Our waitress kindly kept bringing baskets of fresh baguette for dipping because I wasn't letting a drop of that broth go to waste.   I ordered the scallop appetizer for my meal and my boyfriend order the duck with a rich cherry sauce. I delighted in the perfectly cooked scallops that were surprisingly paired with sweet creme fraiche. I also got to try a bite of the duck, which was moist and melted in my mouth. The cherry sauce was strongly flavorful, but not overpowering.   For dessert we shared the warm chocolate tart. When it arrived, I wished that it was a bit warmer (since it was advertised as a warm tart), but I wasn't disappointed at all with the flavor. I appreciated how it was rich, dark chocolate--almost to the point of being bitter. The freshly whipped, sweetened cream was the ideal balance for the rich chocolate.   The service was exceptional throughout the entirety of the meal. Our waitress never hovered and gave us our privacy but never failed to appear right when we needed her. Everyone was pleasant and helpful from start to finish. Our visit to Paris 66 was a fantastic experience.",

    "text": "I've had consistently wonderful experiences at this restaurant and can confidently categorize it as one of my favorite go to places in Pittsburgh. I am partial towards French cuisine, and feel like I've been transported to the heart of Paris when I walk into this place. As soon as you walk in, you greeted by native French restauranteurs that welcome you to your table. I've had several things on this menu now including the mushroom soup (with just a touch of cream, you've reached umami in the Truest sense), the coq au vin (perfectly tenderized chicken that cuts away like butter, cooked in a decadent savory sauce), the rainbow trout (seasoned just right with parsley, butter and lemon as to not over power the delicate and already tasty fish) and finally the sea bass (two filets of fish accompanied by rice and seasoned mix of red and green peppers). All the dishes I've tried are fantastic, but my favorite has to be the Moules Frites. The  Marienere rendition, with mussels seeped in a broth of white wine, shallots, and parsley, and according to my dad who travelled the world working in the restaurant business his whole life, is exactly the way you are supposed to prepare it. Top off this fantastic meal with one of their fabulous desserts including chocolate mousse (a truly decadent and rich treat), pear and almond tart (light and refreshing) or the grand mariner souffle if you are feeling bold. Final comment, the main waiter that I've had the pleasure of having each time I've gone is fantastic, professional, humorous, and has the best accent!",

Writing about it is making my mouth water. What's better than warm soup and melty cheese in the middle of a Pittsburgh winter!?   For dinner I ordered the filet mignon. This came with fries which were outstanding, and steak covered in mushroom sauce (I don't remember the details). Everything was savory and delicious. Being half full from the soup, I had to take leftovers home. But don't worry, I had steak for breakfast the next day   Honestly, I don't remember the super French name of the dessert I ordered but I do remember the moment it was set on fire.

We called in before we go and they were able to fit us in in a short notice. Probably because it was Thursday, I would recommend to plan ahead if going on a Friday night or weekends. When we got there, parking was a huge pain! Leave yourself 10-15 minutes extra for parking. Wish they can add valet service.  The food! Ah my, best escargot, it was very tender and flavorful. I also had the smoked salmon carpaccio for appetizer. Excellent! For our entry, we got the boeuf bourguignon, I wish it served with some pasta or so, it was a little bit salt to eat by itself. Dessert was very good as well, the chocolate mousse was very rich and the crepe was sweet.  The service was slow but our server was very polite. Also one thing learned over the dinner was you need to ask for check if you are finished. It is not polite to just bring you the check. They don't want you ever feel like they are rushing you out. I can't wait to go back there to check out the regular menu and I'm sure everything will be great!",

I have found other decent French places in Pittsburgh area but no souffle. So i was most excited about this, though was a little skeptical after everything else , and the fact there was no warning to order this dessert ahead of time.  They served my Grand Marnier souffle with an awesome presentation ( though odd given souffle is known to be super delicate) by pouring the alcohol on fire over it - i was so excited until i took a bite and realized they basically served me what tasted like fancy ice cream and def not a legit souffle.  I ordered the Coq au Vin- somehow the chicken tasted dry while the carrots were undercooked to point I couldn't cut them with my fork.  Also , our service was less than desirable.  I don't often write negative reviews but I was so shocked after being mislead, in my opinion, by all the raving reviews and awards.  Maybe it was a bad night but I don't get the hype.",

I chose Paris 66 based on the fact I had never been there before and a few friends said they had good meals there.  The meals and the ambience of the restaurant were fine but the service was absolutely atrocious.  While we were seated promptly, it took forever for a waitress to come over and take our drink order, which didn't mind us too much because my friend and I were too busy catching up.  We asked our hostess several questions in order to make a decision and it took nearly 10 minutes for her to come back and take our order.  In addition, we were unable to get any speciality drinks (latte, espressos) since their machine was broken.  I ordered an omelette; however, I was told I could not get egg whites since the chef didn't make subsitutions but I could get it without cheese.  My omelette was delicous and my friend had a salty crepe which was also as good.  Since our waitress was MIA (you think she would have been more attentive since her salary comes from tips) we flagged down the hostess, who stated she didn't service tables and didn't answer our questions, or other servers walking by.  During our meal I got an email from OpenTable saying the restaurant cancelled my reservation.  Um well that's hard to do since I was there and stated when I checked in that it was made using OpenTable.  I spoke back with the waitress when we left and she barely acknowledged me.  I even called to talk to someone from management about the issue with the reservation; they said they couldn't fix it.  I also told them about the poor service we received which was followed up with an \"I'm sorry\".  I don't want to completely discredit the place because the food was great and we loved the ambience of the place.  However, I will not go back unless there is some shake up in their management/service in order to provide quality and customer satisification.",

Fortunately, they have no problem substituting the traditional crepe if you ask :) Sometimes the noise level inside is pretty high, but I think that's just part of the \"bistro\" feel!

SLOW service - 3 hours to feed our table on a slow wednesday night?  We were starving and had to ask for more bread.  Avoid the salmon - it is dry - the risotto was inedible and dry, the coffee only lukewarm, steak and fritte good but expensive for what you get.  Shrimp and pasta lacked flavor and had WAY too much butter -  Lovely server but slow slow slow. Macarons good but I can get them elsewhere.(the ones from the French bakery in Millvale are larger and more reasonably priced)  I was so excited to come for dinner - so disappointed.  Chairs on deck in back are terribly uncomfortable when you spend three hours seated on them. Please put cushions on them    Not sure I would ever go back and I love french cuisine. Please reconsider your prices - even our expensive dessert crepe was lacking.  So sad.   so very sad this was not a good dining experience.    Even sadder that no one asked if we enjoyed our meal.  Loved it when it was just crepes and salad place - now.....not so much.     Back to the french bistro in Sewickley when the urge for french food strikes again.    Sad, sad, sad.  I really wanted to love it!",

We have a quiche, two benedicts (one salmon, one spinach), the brunch plate, an omelette, a few croissants on the side, five (great) cafe au laits, and one bloody Mary. The food is exceptional and the service great. The atmosphere and deign of the cafe is inviting and peaceful. Initially, my qualms might have been with the total - $120 - but on reflection is aligns with what we had and the quality of service. A lovely place.",

    "text": "I desperately wanted to love Paris 66, but I just couldn't do it. I will say, right off the bat, that this restaurant had the best, most attentive, on-the-ball waitstaff of any restaurant I've ever been to in Pittsburgh. I can not say enough nice things about them.  However, everything else about the restaurant was simply underwhelming. We ordered beef burgundy (29$) and a lamb shank on special (28$). The beef was tender but completely overwhelmed by the salt pork flavor. The lamb, however, was hard as a brick on the outside. I literally had trouble putting my fork into portions of the meat because it had hardened up so much in the oven. The outside was like eating slightly soft beef jerky.   The bottom line is, the food is FAR too expensive too be plagued by such problems. If this is their usual quality, I'm uncertain how they can compete with cheaper, better quality food such as Meat and Potatoes, Piccolo Forno, or even Salt or 11.  I would, however, recommend this place for their desserts. I would consider stopping here after an evening at another restaurant for dessert and coffee.",

It reminds me of cafes in South Park, SOMA. Strange thing is, I think Paris 66 costs more for less quality & quantity.   I had a savory crepe and was surprised that it was $10. If you're from the Bay Area you probably know Crepevine. The portions at Crepevine are generous (with salad and potatoes) and it tastes great for less than $10. Also, I'm not a fan of Paris 66's wheat crepes that they use for their savory crepes. I only ate the filling.  If you're in Pittsburgh and crave savory crepes I advise looking online for a recipe for crepe batter and filling them with chicken, tomatoes, and feta.",

Apparently they have decided they no longer want our business.   Tonight we intended to celebrate our new engagement at Paris 66. We arrived tonight, a Saturday evening with crappy weather, around 7:15. The parking lot was empty, and so were most of the tables. The hostess, however, seemed to believe they were packed to the gills. She asked if we had a reservation, and when we said no, she said she couldn't get us in until 8:45. I was confused because we have been here many times before and never even needed to wait for a table-- never mind the fact that the restaurant was empty.  The hostess did not offer to let us wait to see if another reservation did not show, nor did she apologize for the inconvenience. We left and went to another of the many restaurants in the area. While there, I checked open table and there were reservations available at Paris 66 immediately.   I really hope that this was a case of a clueless hostess and not some newly developed snobbishness regarding my fiance's lack of shaving. Regardless, We need to find a new date restaurant.",

Appetizers (tartar and dried meats) were adequate at best and fish entrees mixed (one served ice cold). Forty-five minutes between courses,for Pete's sake! Admittedly this was Saturday night, but it did not help to see the fellow who introduced himself as the general manager incessantly texting. Al fresco deck is lovely but the interior was super-hot, to the point that cooks could be overheard complaining. With time they may get this right but a ways to go before fulfilling very promising potential.",

    "text": "It seems like a theme for me, but this is a restaurant that I deeply want to love but just can't.  This place is walking distance from my house and is as appealing a concept as anything that I can imagine.  A French Bistro in my own neighborhood in Pittsburgh...?  Awesome.  But, the reality is nowhere near as great as the \"dream.\"  The food at Paris 66 is for the most part just okay.  As far as Crepes are concerned, they are fine, though not any better than Crepes Parisienne off of Walnut St.  Two things bothered me though.  1.  We ordered an olive tapenade appetizer (one of the few available).  We were told that the tapenade would come with Tortilla chips.  I was surprised and skeptible but thought, \"hmmm maybe it will be surprisingly good, and combination that works...maybe this is the new style in Paris...I don't know.\"  We got it, tried it.  It is a really really terrible combination.  It totally doesn't work.  The tapenade itself was just fine but the combination was awful.  Kind of like putting a slab of aged cheddar on a tuna steak.  Each component is just fine, the combo is ridiculous.  We asked for a baguette and were given it.  The baguette and tapenade combo was nice but I just don't understand who thought that the original combo was a good idea.  2.  I ordered a \"french\" pizza on a flaky puff pastry type roll instead of typical pizza crust.  I am on board with the concept, but what they do is make the pizza ahead of time and then heat up a portion to serve.  The problem with this is that the crust ends up super flaky and way too crisp and dry.  The crust may as well have been an unsalted saltine cracker.  Just not very good.  The Tarte D'Alsace from Trader Joe's is way better  The dessert crepes were just fine, good but not amazing.  One other thing bothered me.  The service was a bit like a high school musical--enthusiastic, but amateurish.  I do not expect perfection in service.  This was just not good service though.  We asked for an extra plate for one of our kids (did not arrive for 30 minutes).  Drinks, not served until after the appetizer was finished.  Check took 20 minutes from the time we requested even though my wife and kids left the restaurant because of my younger one's restlessness.  The service wasn't mean, or disinterested, or unpleasant etc.  Our server was very very nice, and very pleasant etc., and frankly we tipped well just because I felt like she must be having an off day and sometimes you need a pickmeup on those types of days.  But...the service was not very good.   My review reflects the experience that we had as a couple on one night.  I think that the food is what the food is, that is okay, but not great.  The service is another thing.  I don't think that there is any philosophical bent to make the service less than perfect, I just think I may have caught someone who was pleasant but not very efficient or \"together\" or someone who had an off day.  In my opinion if the service was good, this place is a three.  As it was for our experience, it was a 2.",

They have a nice variety of both savory and sweet crepes, along with many other choices including sandwiches, soups, and salads.  I enjoyed my carrot soup, and my co-diners' sandwiches and salads all looked great.  The prices are reasonable, ranging from $4 for simple sweet crepes, up to around $9 for some of the more elaborate savory creations.  I liked the atmosphere much more than the somewhat hectic vibe of Crepes Parisienne.  It does get crowded, so time your visit appropriately.  The crepes themselves are made with buckwheat flour.  I happen to love buckwheat, but if you're not a fan I could see this being an issue.  There's outdoor seating available out back.",

    "text": "Sigh...I hate writing negative reviews...I really do.  But our experience yesterday was far from what I was hoping or expecting.    After waiting about 45 mins for a table for 4 people for Sunday Brunch (which is about the norm) we were seated outside on the patio on a beautiful sunny day.  Alot of the reviews speak of people greeting you, maybe even in French, as you enter the building.  Well none of this happened to us.  Which is fine, just don't say that it happens if there are no intentions of doing so.  Anyway, our waiter comes over and greets us.  Upon placing our drink orders we are given 2 cups that have food and lipstick on them.  He apologizes, brings a new coffee cup, as well as picks up a container of milk from another table and gives it to us to use.  Well needless to say the milk is curdled from the sun so we had to send another cup of coffee back.    Our food comes.  I ordered soup but was given salad.  My friend ordered a vegetarian crepe; it was served with ham.  My other friend ordered a side of mustard and none was given.  The crepe was sent back, my soup was brought out this time...without a spoon.  LOL.  It was just one of those days where if it could go wrong, it did go wrong.  The waiter was obviously overworked.  Each time someone new was set in his area he would roll his eyes and groan in disgust...loud enough for everyone to hear.  Very unprofessional.  The bill was dropped off, but after waiting 20 minutes for his return, we decided to just leave the money and go...not even a goodbye was given from anyone in this restaurant.  If this is Paris I have no desire to go back again.  The food was delicious but certainly not worth the hassle.",

    "text": "I had a lovely brunch here today.  I started with the Cafe Arrose which was a wonderful combination of Amaretto liqueur, cognac and coffee.  I had mine with a little milk on the side and voila - perfection.  Renaud, my server, went over the specials and I had the cauliflower soup du jour.  The consistency and texture were  divine: silky, creamy and luscious.  The flavor, however, seemed slightly off.  I caught a faint hint of some kind of cheese in the soup and it seemed to overwhelm the natural flavor of the cauliflower a bit but I still enjoyed it nonetheless.  For the entree I had La Paris 66 Les Galette de Sarrasin which is a savory buckwheat crepe filled with ham, swiss and a fried egg.  On the side was a little mesclun simple salad and garnishes of both a creamy mushroom sauce and tomatoes provencale.  I've had a difficult time finding perfect buckwheat crepes in a town like Pittsburgh but Paris 66 Bistro blows this out of the water.  It was a delectable balance of textures and savory flavors.  For dessert I had a Grand Absinthe and some type of flaming crepe with grand marnier and ice cream.  I did not realize the dessert was another crepe so this was a surprise but it was delightful.  American desserts are often overly sugary and way too sweet so this was very nice as it was not too rich or heavy on the sugar.  Regarding the Absinthe:  I was kind of surprised that such an authentic bistro does not have the traditional ice water drip setup.  Most gastropubs or French cafes offering Absinthe typically have a vase or container with ice and water and adjustable valves so one can light the sugar cube on fire and allow the cold water to slowly run over the smoldering sugar cube drop by drop.  Paris 66 instead presents you with your Absinthe and the sugar set over the suspender with cold water on the side.  They use granulated sugar so it's a bit more difficult to light it on fire and impossible to control the water droplets as you're adding the water yourself.  Had I known this, I would have ordered a different digestif but oh well.  Finally I ended with a simple latte which was perfectly brewed.  The ambiance here is charming without being tacky and is absolutely what I've observed in little bistro type cafes in France.  Pittsburgh really does have a gem with this place.  Renaud was very helpful and perfectly accommodating although I could tell he was kind of busy.  It seemed like he was slightly overwhelmed but he was so pleasant in answering questions I didn't even care.  With such charming ambiance and music who would want to rush?  Overall, I will definitely return.  Great service and amazing food.",

Was there and being my mother was old and not able to walk far, I asked fro a seat closer to the door. The hostess was hesitant, but didn't deny me the seat.  Took the waiter near 10 minutes just to greet us and bring us water. Took almost 20 minutes just to get the worse French onion soup I've ever eaten there. The cheese was uncooked and the soup was salty. On to the entree. Ordered filet mignon and it was unbearable. I've eaten there a few times before this mother's day weekend was literally the worse. Food was awful, and service was awful. I had to sit and wait darn near 15 minutes just to ask for my check. This was embarrassing and most of all disappointing to my mom since I told her so many good things. As much as I love French food. I would rather wait to go to  Paris to indulge. WIll not be returning to Paris 66. Where parking is impossible and the service is unpredictable.",

    "text": "I wanted to love this restaurant.  After all, I am a lover of all things French.  It just didn't meet my expectations.  I do give credit to the owners for trying to make it right (and it did help some), but still not the experience I was hoping for.  The first thing that was off putting is that the tables are extremely close to each other.  It wasn't bad when there was no one seated next to us, but when they did seat the next table, it made it difficult for them to get into the table and us to leave at the end of our meal.  It also was a little awkward because it was almost as if we were sitting together as one party and were a part of each others conversations even though neither of us had any desire to.  The second thing that was off putting is that there are signs everywhere for a three for $30 menu.  On the door, on every table.  When we inquired with our server about what the options were for that menu, she said they \"decided not to do it that day\"  We asked her why and she said she would find out.  Apparently the executive chef was \"away on business\" and they \"didn't have the capacity\" to serve that menu.  I suppose that should have been a clue as to the experience we were going to have, but with a number of other appealing options, we ordered.  They were out of one of the appetizers I wanted to try, so I started with the escargot.  It was tasty and just as I expected.  Although so hot that when I took my first bite (several minutes after it was delivered to the table), I nearly burnt my mouth.  My fiance and I both had the pumpkin bisque, that day's special.  The bisque was tasty and we both really enjoyed it.    Both of our appetizer dishes came out fairly quickly, so we were expecting the same for our entrees.  The restaurant did get more crowded as we were waiting, so some wait time would be expected.  But 15 minutes went by.  20 minutes.  25 minutes.  And not even a visit from our server.  As I was getting ready to flag any restaurant personnel down, our server finally returned to let me know there was a \"mishap\" in the kitchen and that they \"had to do some scrambling because they were out of arugula\" and that our entrees would be up soon.  It  was another 5 or so minutes before my fiance's ravioli were delivered.  She indicated that since they don't have a warmer, they brought his out so it didn't get cold.    My Paris 66 Galettes came out about 5 minutes later.  I hadn't had galettes since a visit to Brittany in college, so I was extremely excited to try them.  It didn't disappoint.  Very tasty and met with expectations.  the mushrooms were perfectly flavored.  I just wish there had been more of them!  The owners of the restaurant came over while we were eating our entrees to apologize for the delay and offered us free dessert to make up for it.  It was a nice gesture and we enjoyed our desserts but it didn't quite make up for the extreme delay.  When we ordered desserts, we learned that they were out of bananas for the nutella crepe, so my fiance had it with strawberries instead.  (which turned out to be amazingly tasty).    Now - the desserts were amazing.  In fact, it may be worth a return visit just for drinks and dessert.  I especially enjoy that they have a huge selection of macrons.  Will I return?  Probably not, unless it is just for the desserts.",

I was able to try some other dishes at the table that were sweet and that wouldn't have been bad choice either.  I am not familiar with French cuisine, but this makes me want to explore more.  Some of the staff was speaking French, which added to the authenticity. It was a good way to start the day before we say Cirque du Soleil in the Strip Distruct.  We sat closer to the front, but the back patio area looked cute. We had called ahead for reservations, but it wasn't crowded.",

    "text": "My husband and I took visiting family members to the brasserie last night and had a lovely time. It's an understatement to say that our guests are discerning diners, so when they gave Paris 66 an enthusiastic thumbs up, we knew we had a winner. The service was well-balanced; our waiter/sommelier was cheerful and very helpful; and the ambiance was relaxing -- quiet enough to have a nice, long conversation. The place, itself, is charming, if not a little cliche with all the French lithograph reproductions on the walls. It was fun, however, to use my rusty college French there, with much encouragement from the staff.   The menu is typical of a good brasserie in Paris or New York, and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal. According to our guests, their dishes were expertly prepared and nicely seasoned. The hearty portion sizes seemed more typical of Pittsburgh than Paris. For what we enjoyed there, including very nice bottles of wine, the price was reasonable.  I was pleased to see that the restaurant is accessible for wheelchair users. There was a valet to park our wheelchair van, no barriers to entry and fully accessible bathrooms. If you're going there in warm weather, you may want to ask if the patio is accessible.  The reason I'm giving Paris 66 four, rather than five, stars is because it had no options for vegans. While restaurants in France are some of the last holdouts when it comes to accommodating vegans and vegetarians, I believe every restaurant in a vegan-friendly city like Pittsburgh should be able to make at least one vegan meal (even if it's off-menu) so all guests feel welcome. I ended up ordering a shrimp-veggie pasta dish without the shrimp, which was vegetarian but not vegan. I encourage the brasserie's talented chefs to get creative with traditional French flavors and come up with a few vegan dishes. We will be thrilled to spend our money there again when they do.",

Not an unsatisfied person in the crowd - the food was delicious.  It seems like 11am was a great time to head here for brunch.  By the time we left at 12:30 there was a line out the door.

In contrast to many other yelp reviewers, i found the service perfect - helpful, attentive, but not overbearing. The waitress was very accommodating.  My food was good, but not top notch. The snails were tender, buttery and garlicky. The way they are supposed to be. The boeuf bourguignon was good, although not nearly as good as the one I do (True, i do an amazing bourguignon). So fine, perhaps 4 star if I was just rating quality, but not succulent. Also, it was a bit too salty. (What's wrong Pittsburgh with salt? Cure was also way too salty!!)  That said, around the table, others seemd much less happy with their food. And, the price just isn't right: it's too expensive ($29 for the bourguignon) for the quality of the food.",

If you speak French, do use it! This aspect livened the atmosphere and made it all the more fun.  Savory buckwheat crepe: La Champs de Mars had delicious smoked salmon. I'd recommend ordering a side of l'epinard (spinach) to go with it. Each bite I assembled some crepe with a sliver of salmon and a dollop of spinach--divine. The crepe itself was not amazing, but altogether it was something else.  And the macaroons are phenomenal. I had the White Chocolate with Basil, and from now on I'm a basil-dessert fan. The entire quarter-sized pastry was beautifully crafted with fresh ingredients--you can taste it it's so fresh.  Plus the environment just ties everything together--language, art, people. It all makes me want to go to France so much!",

I had the La Bastille galette, and wasn't a fan either of the consistency of the filling, nor the texture of the crepe. Maybe this is authentic French. I wouldn't know.  I will give credit where credit is due though: the creme brulee was fantastic. Wonderful caramelized top and light, not-too-sweet interior.

The flavor combinations were perfectly subtle. The ingredients on the menu were exactly what you got.  Everyone was surprised at the small portion sizes. I think the prices were too high for what you get. Several people in my party had to order multiple \"entree\" dishes to have a decently-sized meal. You can spend 9 - 13 + on one crepe and I promise you will still be hungry. I wish it was more clear that you're expected to order multiple dishes if you want a decent meal. I carelessly ordered one dish and left hungry. It felt more like a snack than a meal.  Drinks: The wine and cocktail selection was very decent and included many French selections. The beer selection was underwhelming. They had a good assortment of other fruit / soda beverages for the children - just note they do not serve fountain drinks and go by the bottle (I do not mind this). The coffee was good.  Service: Young servers with decent knowledge about the food. Our server was friendly and fulfilled all of our requests flawlessly. The service was excellent in my opinion.  I would not go back here for the brunch menu. The food was decent enough that I may give them the benefit of the doubt and try dinner some day. But probably not until they either reduce their prices or increase the portion sizes.",

The Foie de Gras was absolutely amazing and was probably on of the best items I have ever had. The Duck Confit was tasty but I felt it was maybe too oily and was as a result very heavy and filled me up quick. The Mousse was very good. It was very rich. My total bill was around $66. I did feel this was a bit high although considering the fare it most likely was reasonable.  Overall it was a very nice experience. I'd say the highlight was getting to speak French with my waitress who was very accommodating both in serving me and in entertaining my bilingual efforts. Also, the Foie was out of this world. I can see myself returning when I am ready to splurge again.",

I definitely don't think its worth the price tag.

The crepes were fine (but who wanted to pay so much for crepes when you could get perfectly reasonable ones from Crepes Parisiennes in Shadyside? But, I guess that's no longer an option), brunch was fine, and dinner was fine. I mean, everything was FINE. But nothing was stellar (except for the macaroons. those were out of this world).   So, I didn't go back for a while. Thankfully I was persuaded to go by some friends, and what a change! I think management is trying really hard to go hard-core French, so the servers all speak French and appear to be legitimate Frenchpersons! The menu has changed and now the dinner entrees are much more traditional French fare.   When we last went, they unfortunately had run out of everything we wanted to order. And I'm not even exaggerating; I tried to order the duck breast... no go. My husband and another friend tried to order the lamb shank special... no go. They even told us they only had one left, and so my husband and our friend had to decide who would get it, and then they came back to tell us that they actually didn't have ANY left! Despite all this, we really enjoyed the meal and would be happy to go back again. I guess management just has to work on procurement... Excellent desserts, but... wait for it... NO MORE MACAROONS. Gah! This place is too popular for its own good!  So, if you weren't impressed with Paris 66 before, give it another whirl. It's worth the try.",

Side of bacon for $2 was massive and served three people.  Poached eggs with blue cheese and tomato were rich and savory.  My main complaint is that at an upscale eatery like this, it's a bit of a shocker to get a wine glass filled with orange juice from concentrate.  Don't be cheap, serve real orange juice that's not from concentrate.  Fresh squeezed would make it a five star review.",

As we walked through the restaurant it was very warm.  Uncomfortably so. Our server was Eric and he really took care of us. All of the food was prepared perfectly and plated with a nice presentation.  We shared a couple of appetizers. The pate was very good and the escargot was the best I have ever had.  Everyone was happy with the starters and the main courses were perfection.  We all are planning on returning soon. Maybe for brunch.",

I was quiet, and filled with tons of beautiful knick knacks and french items.   The service was very nice - a young french girl. I recognized many of the items on the menu but some were unfamiliar. I didn't request a translation but I sensed she would have given me accurate descriptions of the items, had I asked.   I got the croque Madame, which was excellent. The manager stopped by, and he was a True pleasure to talk with.  Overall this place was a real winner. Great food and service in a nearly unbelievable atmosphere. A place perfect for romantic dinner!!  I would highly recommend this location.",

    "text": "My wife and I had a really great experience at Paris 66 over Valentine's Day weekend.  We went for the prix fixe menu and were not disappointed.  The restaurant seemed authentically French with the kitchen and waitstaff communicating with each other in French, but it wasn't over-the-top.  The dinner started out with a crostini that consisted of a goat-cheese filled puff pastry and a whipped sweet-potato cinnamon pear dish.  Both were excellent and unique.  I had the foie gras two-ways for an appetizer.  The brulee was excellent, and the au chocolat was so so; the walnut bread both were served with was a perfect complement to the foie gras.  My wife had a puff pastry with scallops and shrimp which she enjoyed.  For the main course, I had a perfectly cooked lamb shank with a delicious dark gravy, served with brussels sprouts and truffle mashed potatoes.  There was a disparity in temperature between the very hot lamb and the nearly cold brussels sprouts that I didn't find enjoyable, but overall the dish was very good.  My wife had a seafood dish that looked good but small.  Dessert really shined as my wife had something frozen that they flambeed at the table with Grand Marnier.  It was quite good.  I had a chocolate lava cake that was accompanied by a raspberry whipped cream.  Both desserts were executed perfectly and were the perfect ending to a great meal.",

    "text": "I went there with a couple of friends for Restaurant Week to try different places. This place is a little small and crowded, but the atmosphere is interesting with the table and wall decorations. We were seated on the side for six people, but due to a column in the wall, the end table had to be moved out in order for people to get in to take our seat. A little awkward as everyone seated on the wall were trapped unless we moved a table out of the way.  Since it was Restaurant Week, we all ordered the special they had, which was Escargot, Beef Wellington, and Macarons. Service was a little slow, but I think that was due to all of us ordering the same thing, which mean they had to prepare multiple identical dishes before bringing it out. The Escargot was good and started the evening well.  The Beef Wellington was well made and the asparagus was tasty, but the breading around the beef was too salty for some reason. The beef was soft with a juicy pink center, though slightly plain and unseasoned. I suppose the saltiness of the breading complimented it, but the two extremes didn't work well.  For dessert, we had our choice of three different macarons flavors. They had quite a bit and this was what I was most interested in. They were slightly hollow, but it's hard to make a perfect macaron and it's more of a technical point. They were delicious, and for the price, it's not bad.  Overall, it has a nice atmosphere if you want to try something new. It's a bit pricey for the dishes given what we had and the size of the place is not well suited if you have a large group, so I'm reluctant to go back. However, I think this is a nice place to get macarons if you ever have a craving for them. The pricing is about average for the cost of each and there's plenty of variety to choose from.",

    "text": "Paris 66, je t'aime!  To say that I love Paris 66 would be an understatement. I love and adore Paris 66.  It is by far my most favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. They've gone out of their way to make it charming and not seem cheesy. I don't know if you've noticed, but it's really easy to go wrong with Paris decor. Instead of puking Paris all over the walls, they have subtle Parisians tones. It's exactly what you'd expect a small cafe to be like in Paris.  Earlier this year my husband and I walked in after seeing their sign on the sidewalk. A french restaurant in Pittsburgh? I just had to see if they had macarons. I LOVE macarons, and I have been on the search for the perfect macaron on this side of the pond. And I don't mean those silly coconut cookies or whoopie pie like creations people try to call macarons. No, I want THE french macaron!   Well, Paris 66 has them. Their macarons are exactly what a maracon is supposed to be: mana from Heaven. They have the perfect egg shell crust that is crunchy on the outside, yet soft on the inside, their feet are perfectly formed, and the flavors are strong. They are delightful.  After our initial intro to their macarons, we had to go back.   We've been there for lunch (you can't go wrong with the croque-monsieur) and most recently we went there for my birthday in August. This time we went with my sister, brother-in-law, and my young nephew (he's just under and year and half).  We had a wonderful time. Our waiter, Renaud, was from France, which made the experience all the better (if you speak French a lot of the staff speaks it natively and will kindly speak to you in French or English).  He was very attentive to our table, and even paid attention to our little nephew.   The meal was delicious. My sister and I both ordered the boeuf bourguignon;  the beef was so tender that it simply melted in your mouth. The carrots were done perfectly, they weren't mushy, but just right.  I can't remember what the others ordered, but I do know that they loved what they had.   After our dinner Renaud brought out the birthday cake we had brought with us (unfortunately, they don't have cakes available, however we were allowed to bring in our own).  He had lit candles on it and sang happy birthday. He even included some blown up balloons to add the festivities of the table.  It was the perfect dinner.  I don't think it's possible to order a bad thing on their menu, and the service is always spectacular.   Do yourself a favor, go for a meal (or heck, even just a macaron) at Paris 66, you won't regret it.  Dinner can be a bit pricey (again, we've only eaten there for dinner once), but the lunch menu is more affordable.",
