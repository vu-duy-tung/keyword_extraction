My only complaint would be how skimpy my salad was. Almost all lettuce with a couple of tiny salad tomatoes  halves with a shaving of carrot made up this dish. I really like everything about this beautiful place. I hate to complain but I was disappointed to pay twelve dollars for that salad. That said, this establishment is a most welcome addition to Sewickley and one I think will bring more and more people here. Simply put, it will be good for business. Congratulations on this newest addition to Sewickley.",

The only downside is the seating is really limited (maybe 15-20 tops) so it's more take out than Cafe.  About 1/3 of the customer area is taken up with a table and rack selling high end canned and bottled products.  Eliminating this and adding seating would add greatly but overall the food was terrific if you don't mind takeout",

It is family owned and operated by a beautiful and very talented family. For the event we sampled a little bit of the menu but I'm looking forward to going back and ordering a sandwich. I was pleased to find vegetarian and gluten free options to be ample on the menu. The bread and desserts look amazing and I can't wait to try more. This is also a good spot for any shopping for delicious homemade meals. I sampled a walnut pesto from a jar in the store and I haven't stopped thinking about it since!",

I had a cereal milk latte which was amazing and I wanted 8 more. I also tried the turkey club which was delicious. Everything tasted so fresh which I loved. My husband had a Ruben and he also loved it. Their baked goods looked incredible and I loved watching their interactions with folks while we were there, they definitely take time to know their customers. This is for sure a new favorite spot!",

I really enjoyed meeting the owner of the restaurant, learning about its history, and the full family support that contributes to its success. The food here is simple fantastic. I enjoyed two different pasta preparations with the walnut sauce (not to nutty, very subtle yet powerful taste) and classic tomato and basil with a hint of spice. The pizza was cooked on a thicker dough, the burnt broccoli with cheese slice was amazing. There was a very professional presentation on how to make a charcuterie board that I'm going to try and implement with my family over Christmas! In addition this is a prime spot to pick up last minute Christmas gifts if you are still looking - I didn't leave empty handed! I really recommend stopping into this place, they deserve highest praise!",

Breakfast was had and gushed over. It was so good we returned THAT VERY SAME DAY. Dinner was sendwiches and soup and dirnks, all of incredible quality. I have had the pleaseure or coming back again and again and never, ever have I been let down. The pastries? World class. The sandwiches? magnificent. The drinks? I could replace all liquids in my life with their coffee and be A-OK.  The interior is clean and sharp while also being inviting. It's a combination or tile and hardwood that anounces quality as soon as you step in the door. The walls are lined with imported products, all available for purchase, as well as 2 places to refill your water, (sparkling OR still) at your leasure.  The staff is always friendly and patient with questions, reguardless if it's about the food they serve, their extensive selection of cheeses, the bread they bake in house, or jsut how they're doing that day.  It is a combination of quality and casual atmosphere that I feel was lacking from the Sewickley scene. Get after it.",

If you're looking for a last minute gift for someone, I would recommend checking this spot out for a high quality cheese, or meats, along with some delicious condiments. The aesthetic is absolutely gorgeous in here... absolutely a place I can see myself spending the afternoon reading or working. They have sparkling water on TAP, and a sink just hanging out below the food menu- so you can wash your hands without running into the bathroom. Fancy. I went with a ham & cheese croissant and a rocky road chocolate covered oreo. The ham & cheese croissant was delicious- so flaky, and packed with flavor. The oreo was incredibly decadent and delicious. The only issue I experienced was waiting nearly 10 minutes for my ham & cheese croissant to be heated up in the oven. It was clear that it was forgotten about, which was disappointing, as it wasn't really that busy in the cafe at all. Other than that, we had a great experience.",

Luv the decor and the place smelled amazing when I went in.  I knew I was in for something good. I ordered their \"deconstructed latte\" which is a really cool visual experience. They provide you with coffee ice cubes, a little container of espresso,  milk and finally, a syringe filled with sugar syrup. All of the above go into the tall glass with ice cubes of coffee. It was delicious. Plus, because of the ice cubes it was a long lasting treat! I also ordered the porridge for  breakfast and oh my gosh...amazing. There are like six types of grain and coconut and fresh fruit along with a small container of delicious honey. Its very complex tasting and hearty and huge. I really couldn't eat it all. I came back another day and I had to try the turkey sandwich which has this green sauce which is called\"zhoug\" which is some kind of pesto. It was a huge sandwich with tons of turkey and it was so delicious. I also bought a loaf of their cranberry pecan bread which I had last night( a slice but i wanted more!) super dense and just delicious. I haven't had a chance to get to their desserts yet as I'm leaving but their pastries look fantastic as do their other items they sell which Include croissants , cookies, homemade pop tarts To name a few.  Great job on a quaint restaurant  with impeccable food!!!",

Custom everything , amazing selection of products and probably the finest selection of cheeses in Pittsburgh. We each decided to order something different and share. The sandwiches are a work of art, i was told they brine their own meats and prepare everything in house, it certainly comes through in the flavor. I had the oven roasted Turkey sandwich with avocado and an amazing sauce called zhoug. Friends ordered the pastrami and quiche & soup, both equally impressive . We ordered a side or Roman style Pizza , it was as good as Pizzarium, one of my go to spots in Rome. Really an amazing experience . Can't wait to go back. Desserts and breads look amazing. Worth the trip , be prepared to wait , lines are long and it gets loud, love it, amazing vibe!",

    "text": "I agree with the rest of the reviews...the atmosphere is beautiful, clean, very well appointed.  There are also some beautiful food products available both baked in house and imported.  Even the staff is pretty. I went in for a cup of coffee and a baguette around 8 AM on a weekday morning.  The baguettes were not ready; the wait would be about an hour. That's fine. I understand their ovens are very busy. I was pleasantly surprised to hear they are baked in the Sewickley house and not brought from their main bake house in Robinson. I asked what the roast for the house coffee was, and was told it's a mixture. After tasting it, it was very clear that it's a dark roast. I don't like dark roast very much...flavor of the bean becomes lost in the heavy roasting process, the coffee is bitter.  Here's a good talk about over roasting beans... <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FliGwcuFyaNY&s=748b5c6c227b39674cd52822de3b296819398c57349716b4bba5daa980a3a189\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtu.be/liGwcuFyaNY</a> The 12 ounce cup of coffee with a shot of espresso was almost $6 dollars before the tip.  I'm not surprised by the price, but it's a bit uncomfortable for me, And I certainly wasn't paying for coffee. I generally don't go to a place in the morning if I can't get a good cup of coffee there.   I am very happy to see this beautiful cafe open in Sewickley.  The pastries look beautiful.  The shop is full of lovely customers, too. I wish I would have the opportunity to purchase the loaf of bread. Honestly, I probably won't come back, but it looks like there are very many happy customers.",

    "text": "One word... FINALLY. I've been dying to try Mediterra Cafe for weeks now. Growing up, Mediterra's bread was always a staple at the dinner table, so I knew I had to try out their cafe location.  The decor makes for a photog's dream. The black and white tile against the marketplace look is both modern and inviting. There's not an abundance of seating, so at peak times the tables are likely full.   My boyfriend ordered the cold brew and I opted for a cappuccino. The cold brew presentation is second to none; presented on a platter, with the cold brew in a carafe and an ice chunk in a low ball glass. The cappuccino was just what I needed on a dreary Pittsburgh day.   He decided on the porchetta sandwich while I selected the quiche of the day (a goat cheese, spinach, squash, and apple combo served with house-dressed greens). Both were delish and came out in a timely manner despite the cafe being busy.   We were stuffed, but I couldn't leave without some sweets: two pumpkin cookies, and two cupcakes, one red velvet and the other pumpkin cheesecake.   Can't wait to come back to Mediterra for the baked egg breakfast option and their gorgeous charcuterie boards!",

    "text": "I LOVE the interior here. It is really nice. They have clean crisp lines and the decor is beautiful. I have been here twice in the past week.   First I tried the breakfast sammie. It was... not good. The egg was a both soupy (the white) and over cooked (the yolk), which is the exact opposite of what I want in a fried egg. The bread (brioche) was too soft for the amount of pesto they slathered on, and was completely soggy by the time I got home (5-10 min max). I guess maybe the experience would be better if I ate it right there, but overall the consistency of the sandwich was just too soft and the taste was too bland.  Then, we went for dinner, I had the tuna melt. The bread here was a winner. It was toasted to perfection, crisp, and flavorful, but that was about the extent of flavor in the sandwich. The tuna tasted like those flavored pouches that you get from the grocery store, and there was no flavor to the cheese at all. This again led to a bland, although crispier sandwich experience.  We did also get an almond croissant, which we have had before from the market. The baked sweets always seem to be top notch.  I think overall, I will be back for baked goods, but not for food.",

The space is small and tight with a line of patrons that wrapped between the little wall of goods you can buy and some of the table seating. But the tightness did not make it any less enjoyable. Everything on their menu sounded scrumptious. Their counter was filled with beautiful baked goods and of course we tried a few of those too. A great spot for lunch or brunch or grabbing a snack and coffee. I wish there were more establishments like this around the city! What friendly staff and a pleasant experience.",

I loved this place before I even stepped up to the register.   And then I fell in love even more: I ordered the cold brew, and I have never seen such a cool way of serving it!! (unique serving platter only served when you order the large size - 16oz). You are given a gorgeous golden plate with a large sized whiskey glass that is filled with a large square-shaped ice cube. The cold brew is placed in the most beautiful apothecary-like jar that is to be poured over the ice.    I also ordered a yogurt-fruit parfait which was delicious from the first bite to the last.  And, as if this place wasn't cool enough, they sealed the deal by offering water options on tap: still OR sparkling!!  To top it all off: the front windows allow you to observer the hustle and bustle outside",

    "text": "Mediterra is clearly a local favorite! I stopped in on a Sunday at a few different times and every time there was a line with at least 8 people and no open seats to claim as your own.   This cafe isn't one to bring your computer and get work done, but it is perfect to grab a bite with a close friend or significant other. The cozy but light and airy vibe here makes you fully stop and feel like you want to know every intricate detail of what's offered here. You almost feel like you're in Europe at a bustling street cafe, it's lovely.  On Sundays, breakfast is available all day and beautiful coffees and lattes are continuously coming from the barista section of the counter.   You order at the counter and take your number to make visible for someone to bring your order out. Be patient in line as it doesn't move too fast, but once you place the order, it comes quickly. As you wait, you stand along a wall full of products for sale - unique jarred nut butters, jams, sauces, pastas, and more. Take the chance to explore them all, as they'd make a perfect little gift for the right occasion. For all my eco-friendly friends, I was happy to find you're given the option to print, text, or email your receipt upon payment.  The staff is very attentive and care very much about your experience. A few times they came out to various tables to ensure everything was delicious and no one was in need of anything. There's conveniently flat and sparkling water on tap to refill on your own as you need.  Of the seats that are available, the seating quarters are tight, so make friends with those sitting around you. And if you're not into that, maybe order to go. There are a few outlets available along the walls if you need to grab a recharge.  There's plenty of street parking on surrounding streets in this cute Sewickly village, and it's completely free on the weekends. Metered during business hours on the weekdays. Try to come here with some extra time, there's plenty of other shops and things to explore by walking the streets.  The portions are light here, so you'll feel happy and satisfied. But if you're still feeling a little hungry, there's a beautiful display of cakes and pastries to buy as an extra treat.",

    "text": "My husband and I visited yesterday after having stumbled upon this cafe via IG (I know, I know). It was a crisp fall day and walking into the cafe I immediately felt cozy and welcome. The interior is beautiful - it's reminiscent of what you'll find on a cute street somewhere in Europe. A perfect way to spend an afternoon.   The options really are endless if you're looking for a quick snack: breads, pastries, treats, and of course coffee. We wanted lunch so opted for something more substantial and got the quiche of the day (chicken) and soup of the day (butternut squash). To my surprise, the soup came with a side of bread which tasted incredibly fresh! The food was delicious, I wish I had the soup again right now! I love the idea of rotating a quiche and soup to keep the menu fresh. There are also plenty of other options like sandwiches and salads that looked incredible - I can't wait to go back and try them!  The coffee was also great. We got a cappuccino which was my backup as I had wanted to try the deconstructed latte but they were sold out. None the less, it was delicious, one of the better coffees I've had out in awhile! The barista even made it a point to ask if we enjoyed our beverage which I thought was a nice touch.   Finally, what I thought was especially great, the owner stopped by to chat with us before we got our food. He told us a bit about the shop and his potential plans for a next location. Not that every cafe / restaurant owner needs to do that, but it's great to see he cares about customers and the service as a whole spoke to that!   If you don't live in Sewickley, it's absolutely worth the drive to come here for a cozy lunch. It was definitely money well spent and we left saying how we couldn't wait to come back. I would love to spend an afternoon here again during the holidays- it would be all of the good feels!",

    "text": "Mediterra bakery has always excelled in creating superior breads, breakfast pastries, and desserts in their main warehouse in Robinson. Nick A, the owner, has expanded the concept over to Sewickley where he has recently opened this cafe and market specializing in gourmet fare and artisan cheeses.  When I arrived the place was packed solid! There's very little seating room but people are happy to share a table with you if a seat is available. There is also high tops overlooking the front. They carry the same line of pastries and desserts mentioned above but in addition they have sandwiches, salads, toast, pizza, a kid's menu and even breakfast.  Everything can be altered or is already made gluten free or vegan. Since I love their bread so much I decided to opt for a traditional turkey sandwich. They have an extensive beverage menu and on a hot day a cup of cold brew in a giant size ice cube is very inviting. The coffee bar serves Parlor coffee and a variety of ice and hot teas. After ordering I was given a number and told to sit anywhere. Take out is also available. You can get a good meal here at a decent price.  I was pondering about the \"toast\" and my instincts were right. Jackie S. formerly of Josephine's, was one of the original chefs at Smallman Galley works here! She brought out my sandwich to me and I learned that she would be here \"for a while\".  These dishes are made from scratch! Believe me when I saw the size of the bread I knew I really wouldn't need any sides.  If you want water they have up front your choice of either sparkling or plain. Nice touch! My sandwich was melt in your mouth good! I was asking people around me about their salads and quiches. Everyone was pleased with their choices.   As I was eating Nick the manager came around and asking how we were all doing. I thought that was nice of him to make rounds in a place were you have very limited seating. He told me their breakfast specialty was four grain porridge. Well looks like a breakfast visit is in order next time. I did ask him about the breads. They hope to get more in from the main bakery especially my favorite chocolate cherry bread which is out of season for now. The do make their shrubs in house.  After I finished I wanted to explore the items for sale especially the artisan cheese. Many of them are imported from France, England, or Italy. Above the display are two types of giant olives. A nice counter lady waited on me and told me that I was permitted to sample a cheese of my choice before purchase. I sampled the Brillat-Savarin Affine from France which is a triple cream dessert cheese. Imported cheeses are pricey but I asked to purchase only a quarter of it along with some of the bakery's home made rolls. It was literally to die for like eating a bit of cheesecake! She told me how to properly store it and to re wrap it once opened so it will stay fresher longer. I asked if she could get me a dessert to eat there since I didn't want to go through that long line again. She got me a small carrot cake cupcake which after paid thanked her for. With this purchase I got a free tote bag.  Needless to say that cupcake was to die for! After I finished I browsed the merchandise they had for sale. You can buy imported olive oil or local made. They also have herb mixes, spice blends, salt, jams, and honey. Not only that you can buy artisan imported pasta and sauces along with candy bars imported from Mexico and Hawaii. Expect to pay for these things but you are buying quality.  Maple syrup is also available from Rivendale farms. The cafe also serves \"boards\" which include cheeses, charcuterie, and mezze. Full size cakes in the cooler are costly but believe me you won't be disappointed.   The establishment is clean and the layout gives you a European feel. Make sure to check out the display rack before entering the cafe. It was fashioned from an Amish harness.    Located on Beaver St next to Vivo Kitchen and B Gourmet metered street parking is available and there is a metered parking lot off a side street.",

From the beautiful aesthetic to the food, it's an impressive show right out of the gate.   The place is seriously beautiful. The tile walls and floor, the perfectly curated shelves of merchandise, and the display case of delicious food. The ordering process is fairly simple too. You just wait in line, place your order and grab a number.   I was super excited to see Gluten Free Goat bread, so I could actually have a sandwich! I was excited to order the tuna melt, but they had already pre-made the sandwiches to accommodate for their busy opening week. They came out and told me and offered to make a grilled cheese. Seriously, good problem to have, because the grilled cheese was amazing! Fontina cheese and fig spread makes for an incredible combo.   Can I just pause for a second to talk about the sparkling water fountain!!! Okay, I'm done. But seriously, that's awesome. There's also a full coffee bar, and was excited to see there's a house made chai blend. Gotta get that next time I'm in.   I'd love to see some more side offerings to compliment the sandwiches. But I'm sure over the next couple months they'll be tweaking the menu. My only wish was that the place had more seating and was closer to my home (that last part is just a small hint to open a cafe in Dormont)!",

    "text": "Mediterra Cafe is coming in hot!!  I've been impatiently stalking their social media account ever since I first heard that it was coming to Sewickley several months ago.  For as many perfectly lovely places as we have here in the Village, no one location has married together excellent boulangerie/patisserie offerings, high quality meats and cheeses, simple plates, and specialty/high-end grocery the way that Mediterra is clearly aiming to.  My boyfriend and I had dinner on their first open day to the public.  We shared the grilled eggplant and pastrami sandwiches, and while both were excellent, we agreed that the pastrami in particular just got better and better with every bite.   It was so memorable, in fact, that we returned for breakfast just this morning and split a slice of quiche, plus a scone, a butter croissant, an almond croissant, and a regular drip coffee for me and a cold brew for him.  The quiche was done proper: very soft, silky, and custardy. The dressed greens on the side had the perfect amount of acidity and bitterness to compliment it.  My croissants were good, though truth be told, a certain other French bakery located in Lawrenceville & Downtown is still my #1 for being closest to what I've had in Paris and is priced more favorably. However, vennoiseries are much more in their wheelhouse, whereas Mediterra's is clearly in the artisan bread category. Loaves of which are in my To Try Next list. On the whole, however, I found the prices to be quite on par with city prices for similar offerings, if not a little lower. Oh, and before I just breeze over that coffee, can I just say that if you like iced coffee, you have to try their cold brew.  When you dine in, it straight up comes ion a tray in a decanter and highball glass, complete with a giant round cube of ice. Classy as all get out, and not to mention the dang coffee is SO smooth. My drip coffee was lovely as well, although it edged just on the bitter side.  The decor has a bit of a French brassierie feel to it, although most of the grocery items are Italian. I ain't mad about it.  There are so many little details and touches that make this place feel warm and accessible, yet high end. My boyfriend, a marking and visual design guy, was particularly geeked out when he noticed that the window lettering was hand-painted.   And last, but certainly not least, the staff has all been lovely and attentive. It's a lot of hard work to get a new restaurant up and running smoothly, and they seem up to the task.  All in all, this felt well worth the wait, and I look forward to being a regular patron.",

Everything I tried from there was absolutely delicious. I was honestly blown away listening to the owner explain how the company came to grow to what it is now. I bought the BYOB for olive oil and actually need to get back to get some more! Make sure you check this place out if you stop in Sewickley!",

Great way to warm up on this cold day. Had the Pastrami sandwich that came on a marble rye with spicy mustard and some pickled slaw. Sandwich was OK, guess I was expecting better, bread was very dry as if it had been sitting out overnight.  Or maybe a tad over baked. Some of the pastries looked wonderful, so next time!",

We also shared the avocado toast which was good but $9 is a little ridiculous for a piece of toast in my opinion. It was topped with veggies and some seeds.   We also picked up the pecan cranberry bread and a loaf of the olive bread our favorites!!!",

It's a great place to sit and enjoy some quality baked goods and a good cup of coffee with a friend or even a group of friends! Sit down and catch up on life, the kids, love...why not swap some solid dinner recipes you've enjoyed as of late? I don't know what it is about Mediterra...it invites a kind of warmth that'll simply make you a better person.   Seems like a lofty proposition?   Just go there and see.   I don't know who designed that space, but they should be tracked down to design every coffee shop in our great city. It's smart, it's trendy, it's cozy...you'll not want to leave.   There are small tables, window tables, and a large communal table. It's not a huge shop, but to say it's \"small\" would rob it of something. So, I'll say, it's cozy.   There's plenty of street parking and they have good coffee. I'm a coffee snob, and I would rank the coffee a 7.5 out of 10. The experience, however, is a 10. Their breakfast-y options and baked goods (for Pete's sake, buy a fire loaf to take home and to enjoy with some chili) and environment make the experience an 11.   Mediterra even sounds like some kind of mystical land and... it's close to being just that.",

To top it off their food is amazing.   For entrees, the grilled Parma cotta was outstanding. You can tell that all their ingredients are top quality.  In addition, the bread they used is excellent. 10/10 would recommend getting this sandwich.   The avocado toast was also delicious. In comparison to the Parma cotta sandwich though it did not stand a chance. I probably would not order this again as they have so many other lunch options I would like to try.   They also service pastries which I did not try this time. They also have a plethora of beverage options! Definitely stop by this cafe while you're in the neighborhood. Can't wait to come back next time I'm in Sewickley.",

This place does get busy fast, so I would recommend coming on the earlier end of lunch time especially on Friday/ towards the weekend. But the food and atmosphere make it a visit very much worth it.   I would recommend the avocado toast for breakfast and the grilled Parma cotta sandwich for lunch. They also have delicious flatbread pizza by the slice. My favorite drinks are the London fog and the seasonal strawberry milk matcha. However I don't think you can go wrong, there's plenty of great choices to try off their menus and from the pastry section.   Overall, I would definitely recommend!",

We tried the avocado toast with egg, a breakfast sandwich and an almond chocolate croissant. All were very delicious and fresh.

If you ever see their special danish with bacon onion topping, snatch it!  The layers of flaky crust is buttery and melt in yo mouth!   Heard of Vietnamese pate' chaud?  This is the gourmet version!  So delicious.  My usual includes grabbing a ham and cheese croissant and either a coffee or tea.  I did order other scrumptious items like the perfect avocado toast; I am not as much a fan of the baked eggs as the beans threw my taste buds of a bit.  Aged cheeses, bread, pizza, also are offered and by all accounts look amazing!",

The space is accented with wooden tables against a black and white mosaic floor taking you from Pittsburgh to a European cafe the minute you walk in the door. The walls are filled with olive oils, pastas, cookbooks and more. You'll come for the food, but leave with a little something to take home.   For this event particularly we had three stations: bread making, a pasta station and charcuterie board building. Honestly, what more can you ask for? We filled out bellies with two types of pasta, pizza, and appetizers. No shortage of food to taste at this event. As we moved through each station the staff guided us through the cooking or baking process, ingredients selection and care they put into their work. We left with baguettes, coffee and of course - a few desserts!   Highly recommend making time to visit. I'd love to come back on a Saturday morning to try out the breakfast pastries. The menu is full of so many choices, it's hard to decide. One bit of cautious is the space is small so a large group will be difficult.   Looking forward to visiting again in the future! Hope to see more events at Mediterra!",

While their cafe menu is a little on the smaller side for what you may expect, the quality is absolutely out of this world. All their bread is baked fresh in house and the open kitchen concept lets you peer back and see that everything is made to order.   I ordered a vanilla latte, the baked eggs, and some pastries like the oreo cupcake and the chocolate chip scone. The baked eggs arrived piping hot and was incredibly flavorful. Reminds me of a breakfast version of chili - perfect for a frosty spring morning! The latte was smooth and perfectly balanced, and the latte art was nothing short of amazing too!  I can't wait to come back to see what new offerings they always have!",

I went with my sister and we shared the charcuterie board, pizza and chocolate croissant. My favorite was the pizza...literally the best if you like a thicker crust pizza. It was crunchy on the bottom without being too dry, doughy without being too wet, and the toppings were on point.   The croissant was flaky and perfect! After traveling to Italy this summer, I have been missing my morning chocolate croissant and this hit the spot! Served with coffee...I felt like I was back in Tuscany!   In addition to food we purchased a few market items and enjoyed looking through what they had along the walls for dinner ideas and gifts. Overall I would give this place 7/5 stars if I could!",

Owned and operated by a family that really loves and enjoys what they provide and it shows in everything they offer and sell.   During the event we had the opportunity to meet the owner and staff they were so friendly,  informative,  and passionate about what they provide to their customers.    They offer fresh baked delicious breads, pastries, cheeses from around the world, meats for charcuterie boards, sandwiches, chocolates,  jarred pasta sauces, among many many other items.  All so delicious.  You can also bring your own cutting board and they will arrange a charcuterie board to take home.   If you can't make it into the shop they offer some of their bread for sale at Whole Foods stores in the region.    The only negative to this cafe is that there aren't more of them located in the area.",

My husband and I stopped in here on Saturday morning and it was packed. We were looking to go to the market so we planning on getting our goodies to go. Most of our purchases only lasted until we made it to the bench at the intersection.  Pepperoni pizza - after much debate, this slice made it into my top 2 favorite slices in Pittsburgh. The crumb on the crust can't be beat! Props to the chef on perfecting this tasty, airy, chewy, crunchy crust that holds up even after being re heated. You can taste the quality ingredients from the cheese, to the ezzo peps, to the sauce, to the olive oil on the crust. $6 is a little steep, but literally worth every penny.  Blueberry / lemon cream pastry - wow! I have been jonesing for a cheese danish for quite some time and this guy was a no brainer purchase. The crust was a perfectly flaky/chewy croissant with a tart lemon cream topped with blue berries. I keep telling myself that my husband and I split this but it was more 70/30. I couldn't stop! Sausage / onion / pistachio pizza - awesome combo! The crust was the same as above and was topped with crumbly sweet sausage, super thin red onions, and crushed pistachios. Overall very flavorful but could have used a pinch of salt. Pretzel - classic, but done right. Re heated nicely. My husband added some everything bagel seasoning which only added to the slightly sweet, chewy, pretzel. Ham and cheese croissant - I wish I knew what kind of cheese was in this. My guess is a type of cheddar. It stayed melted nicely in the center, but the bits that did ooze our were crunchy and funky. The croissant was crispy, flaky, and chewy and topped with fennel, sesame, poppy, and maybe coriander - the crunch and flavor only supported the main event.  Chocolate chip cookie - I mean why not at this point. Classic chewy cookie but with a hint of cinnamon. There was nothing wrong with it, but there are so many better things to try!  Overall - I clearly enjoyed everything from this cute little shop. I don't know if I'll ever be patient enough to eat in the store, but I'll surely be back!",

I ordered the French toast with mascarpone cranberries and roasted pears. It was very good. The cranberries were tart which was a nice balance with the sweet pears and mascarpone.  It is served with syrup, but it was unnecessary.  It was very filling- half of a giant croissant didn't help. : ) The staff was friendly and accommodating, the food came out relatively fast.  I only gave 4 stars because the seating.  I understand it's a small space, but for a $30 lunch (2people: croissant, 2 French toast and a drink) I would have like to have a sturdy seat, not lawn furniture.",

The coffee was amazing and unique, hands down some of the best in Pittsburgh, and paired with any of their pastries you can't go wrong.  The chocolate croissants were so so good! My sister had traveled to Italy this past summer and said that it was exactly what she had there. Honestly so flaky and buttery. Warmed up on a cold rainy day was just delicious!!  The Roman style pizza was just perfect!! Crunchy on the bottom, thick and soft without being dry or doughy, a good deal of cheese and topping. Honestly maybe the best slice of pizza I have ever eaten. The best way to explain it was, like eating the best piece of Italian bread turned into a pizza.  We also had the charcuterie board, which we were able to do two meats and a cheese, along with accompaniments. It looked beautiful, and was very good.   Along the wall were several authentic items from Italy or Spain which you could purchase. I had to stop myself from buying too much!!   This is a must stop if you are even remotely close, and if you aren't treat yourself and spend some time relaxing in this amazing place. I guarantee you won't be disappointed!!!",

My hubby picked the breakfast Sammie which had a fried egg on it. Also sell an assortment of pasta products and other items to cook at home.",

I won't lie, I had a delicious Oreo cupcake before my pizza was delivered to me outside.
