    "text": "I've finally tried the North Hills famous \"Sir Pizza\".  As a lover of pizza (and cheeseburgers, but that's another story) I find myself often enjoying the debate over who has the best pizza in the burgh' (oh wait... that would be a good \"talk\" thread, I'll have to remember to post) and I often hear \"sir pizza\", so it's a bit shocking its taken me this long to check out this institution.  Incidentally, this may surprise many of you sir pizza lovers, but it turns out according to my girlfriend that said' pizza joint is actually a national chain, which in my eyes does diminish its stature just a bit.  Annie and I stopped here last lazy sunday around 230 pm.  It was pretty empty at the time, however I'm told that's a pretty rare thing and watch out if you stop by after a friday night football game.  The restaurant itself is adequate enough there are plenty of booths scattered about and it looked like a private dining area to the side in the back.  I noticed one of my favorite type of video games.  The two seater table style pacman which is a rare treat indeed.  You order at the large counter in the front.  It looks like they have a really good selection of microbrews and a few beers on tap.  We ordered a large pizza with pepperoni and onions and black olives on half for me.  We also ordered an order of bread sticks and then had a seat.  The breadsticks were up first and quite frankly they were pretty forgettable.  It was four average warm breadsticks served with a relatively tasty marinara.  Then a few minutes later our pizza was up.  The pizza was pretty large and to my surprise was sliced in a very interesting manner in really small cubes almost.  So, instead of 8 slices for example there were about 30 smaller pieces.  I liked this, it was fun and a good way for me to get around my 3 slice rule.  The pizza itself was pretty tasty.  The crust was really interesting.  It was thin crust kind of since it was pretty crispy, but then not quite thin crust because once you got past initial crunch it was a little doughy.  The sauce was a little sweet and plentiful and the cheese was just right not too much not too little.  The pepperoni was also pretty unique instead of slices it was more like crumbled pepperoni which was fitting given the way the pizza was sliced.  Overall the pizza was very good...Certainly not my favorite in the burgh' but maybe that's because I didn't grow up with it.  My buddy says they also make good hoagies here, so I'll have to give that a whirl on my next trip.  One last thing I normally would give this joint three stars, however after we left I noticed when we got to Target I didn't have my wallet.  Annie called and they had found it on the counter and had it waiting for me,,, what a relief.  Overall a good spot that I'll visit again.",

This used to be one of my favorite places to get pizza from when I was growing up and tonight I called in to ask a few questions before placing a take out order and both times I called was treated rudely (the second time, very rudely) by two different male employees.  For example, after I asked two questions - such as how many people does a large pizza feed, how much does a large pizza cost, the employee cut me off and said that he also did not have the answer to the meaning of life.  This may have been somewhat funny if he were joking or laughed afterwards but he was being obviously rude.  I told him I would take my business elsewhere and ended up ordering from the Wexford location (which I really hope has a different owner than the one that hired these two fools).  The folks at the Wexford location were very nice and their pizza just as good as I remember the North Hills location being!  Sir Pizza in North Hills will never get my business again.  No customer asking basic questions about their pizza sizes and prices deserves to be treated rudely.",

Before I say too much in my review I have to admit that this is not my first time coming here and that I have been to Sir Pizza many times throughout the years.   For me it is very much a nostalgic place and I love that they still have tabletop games of Mrs. Pacman and Dig Dug that you can play for a quarter and a jukebox.  For dinner my dining companions and I split two large pizzas, one pepperoni and one half mushroom half cheese and a crusader hoagie.  The pizza is cut interestingly here, 3 times across and 3 times down down giving you a number of small pieces which always leads to you eating just one more.  The pizzas were both good with the pepperoni being crumbled instead of sliced and the sauce seemed to lack some saltiness.  The hoagie was a little soggy by the time it got to me due to the dressing that was on but had a decent amount of Italian meats and tasted pretty good.  I would give the food itself 3 stars.  The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here in the future.  While the food is satisfactory, that is not the only reason to come to Sir Pizza as the atmosphere is great as well.",

I am open minded, love Pizza, and am new to the Pittsburgh area after many years away, so I figured I would try it, and who knows, maybe he was wrong and it will be good.  The sauce sucks, the dough sucks, and even the pepperoni sucks.  I would have been better off getting a Totino's pizza from the local Giant Eagle as it would have been far more satisfying!

I always get one large plane and one large pepperoni, even if it's just me eating it. Love it hot, LOVE it cold for breakfast. I hear that it's a love it or hate it place, I am a SIR PIZZA lover. The staff has always been overly helpful, polite. I've seen some of those guys in there for 30 years. If you are in the North Hills, skip McKnight and head over to Sewickley-Oakmont.  Reasonable prices and a great family business. For those of you who don't like pizza, the salad and spaghetti is good too. Nice beer selection as well.",

Then denied it after called back and asked \"did you just hang up on me?\" and hung up on me again!  I buy from them all the time, never again. Ungrateful jerks!!!! Horrible customer service.  There's so many pizza places, I'll take my business to someone who appreciates it and I suggest you do the same.  Which I did.  Called into another place and they thanked me twice.

If you like a thin crust that isn't flaky-crisp, looking for a truly more personal experience than Pizza Hut, you MUST GO TO SIR PIZZA!    This hard-to-find special taste, crumbly toppings, cubed pepperoni, and original crust is much sought-after by Hoosiers who have scattered across the nation.  The corporate HQ in Muncie even has a special shipping department to send their pizzas to your home with baking instructions!  The North Hills Sir Pizza is a family owned franchise with personalized customer service -- akin to finding your place in your local CHEERS bar.  They try to know everyone by their name and they serve up lunch or dinner like we're all family!  I've often stood at the counter and felt I was having dinner table conversation with pizza man about life, love, and the Steelers!  An anchor of the community, a transplant franchise operation that feels like it's a 'Burgher through and through.  Quality food, reasonable prices.  Fun video games for the kids.  Juke box.  And while you're there, get to know the owners/operators by their family photos framed on the wall!  On my wish list:  earlier lunch hours, larger dining area, delivery service.  Do I see it coming?  No.  Can I live very happily without it?  Yes!    For three generations, my family's tradition is to come to Sir Pizza (or Pizza King) and share the experience from parent-to-child.  We are not alone in saying we travel the world and come back here to celebrate with an old favorite:  (2) large pizzas, (1) 1/2 pepperoni and sausage, (1) 1/2 pepperoni and extra cheese ... PLEASE.  Service with a smile that builds memories of t-ball team victory parties, celebrating the end of final exams, Friday Happy Hours -- family style, and large pitchers of ice cold cold making the rounds!",

It's best friend is definitely the sausage. You just can't go wrong with it. If you are feeling like you want something more elaborate, get the works, or as we call it at Sir Pizza, \"The Royal Feast.\" It's a flavor party in your mouth.       The atmosphere here is just great. It's definitely family-like. The guys behind the counter are great and everyone is just in a great mood. We'll come here to celebrate sports victories, after meeting snacks, pregame meals, parties, just about anything you can imagine. My family just loves this place so much.      My friend used to hate Sir Pizza, he went there once and he said that the crust was too salty and that the pizza was cut weird. I kept telling him that he needed to go back and one night he finally relented. The next day he told me exact what I always thought. He told me that it was the best pizza in the 'Burgh and and the square pieces are a good idea. You can eat just the right amount of pizza because the pieces are small and it might sound crazy, but the square pieces might just make the pizza taste better. Just more Sir Pizza legend, but I'm here to tell you that it's probably True.       If you don't know where to eat, and want to eat good food, then venture out to the North Hills Sir Pizza and make not just your day, but your entire week. It's just that special.",

I had asked for all meat and they gave me a supreme.. and I couldn't just pick out the olives, mushrooms etc because they are chopped up and under the cheese.  They had no interest in even talking to me, it was just \"Here take it\".  They were busy but not THAT busy.  The pizza itself wasn't good.. the crust tasted stale!  Not crispy, it was stale.  The toppings were so tiny and it was just all around not a good time.  I give it 1 star for the sports games they were playing on the flat screen TVs.  Thumbs down on the customer service and the pizza.  I won't be coming back especially when there are so many pizza places that actually don't treat you like crap and have fresh pizzas.

The crust is thin, almost non-existent, the cheese is barely melted and the pepperoni is diced like something you would find at a salad bar.

    "text": "I think the \"Love it or Hate it\" comments on other Sir Pizza reviews are definitely fair.  Sir Pizza offers a very different pizza from other local pizzerias, but I find the pizza to be delicious.   We have ordered multiple times and generally just get a large cheese pizza.   It is a round pizza, cut into squares with cheese all the way to the edge (effectively giving the pizza no real crust).  It is great for large groups as it is easy just to grab a couple squares of pizza.  I would definitely recommend the plain cheese - they used diced pepperonis / sausage as opposed to the normal full pepperonis you would typically see at a local pizza shop.  A large cheese pizza feels like a decent value to me, running around $12.  We live a few miles away and they have always been able to have the pizza ready in a half hour, even on busy Friday / Saturday nights.  Why not 5 stars?  They don't offer delivery and the parking lot can be logistically challenging, particularly when it's busy.   Additionally, the menu is relatively limited and the toppings seem to be mediocre (good, but not great) quality.",

The sauce, dough, cheese, and toppings are nothing like a traditional pizza and that makes me happy because I can get those types anywhere in Pittsburgh. The sauce it's self is a bit on the sweet side, to combat this I add plenty of cheese and red pepper flakes. The dough is thin and crispy but not too thin like a cracker, and the pizza is sliced \"party style\".  The interior is a great transition from the past to the present including family photos, a juke box, super Mario cabinet and a Pac-Man cocktail table.  They serve alcohol as well as soda (which is only $1.15)   I love this place and will keep coming back!",

I've also gotten the Crusader Hoagie here which is a toasted Italian sub cut into 4 pieces and serves on a plate with a generous proportion of chips on the side. They do have a nice dining room area with a few televisions. You can also order for pickup, however they do not deliver.   I can assure you this pizza is unlike any you have had before.

    "text": "Sir Pizza is very hit or miss.   First off, I would like to say that if you are a traditional Italian, Sir Pizza is like a mortal sin. Instead of the common round pie with the  large triangular slices, they have a round pie with small square-like slices. You can see a picture of this somewhere on the page. Anyway, that is my fair warning before info into the pros, cons, and neutrals.  Pros: Sir Pizza is very unique. The pizza's toppings are shredded onto the pizza. I have never seen this before so I thought I should mention it. Also, if you bring along the kiddies, they have these retro Pac-Man and Dig-Dug arcade games. They do cost quarters, but I think it is worth it to keep you preoccupied. They have a party room as well for special occasions. Finally, it is overall cheap.  Cons: The place is usually packed with people. You will wait a long time to get the pizza(s) you ordered. There are no waiters at Sir Pizza. You order at the counter what you want, sit down and wait. They do not have any dessert items to server either. The closet thing you can have to a treat after pizza is getting some cheap donut at the convienent store next door.   Neutrals: The sauce on the pizza is very sweet. I know this would be a big turn-off or turn-on for people so I just put it here. Lastly, the do serve things like hoagies, but they are very run of the mill. If you ever go to Sir Pizza, you go for the pizza.",

    "text": "Sir Pizza certainly has a love-it or hate-it taste/style to it, obviously I am for the love-it side of the fence.  I grew up in the mid 80's nearby off of Rochester Road and this was probably the closest pizza place around our home.  The fact that it has remained for nearly 30 years of my lifetime shows they have a following enough to sustain business!  I have lived in Phoenix, Arizona for the last 12 years and although I have paid a visit to PA from time to time I this may have been my first visit to Sir Pizza  in those 12 years.  I was showing my wife (whose never been to Pittsburgh) where I grew up and around the city and Sir Pizza was on the tour as a must to stop and eat at! The visit did not disappoint, unless you count her introduction to I.C. Light which brought a very funny face out.  Service was friendly, fast and when I said I hadn't been here for years the gal at the counter said welcome back.    The pizza did not disappoint us and only added to the great time we were having.  We ordered a 14\" pepperoni which is my go to here and the small cuts almost always lead me to go for one more.  We said we'd stop eating with 10 pieces on the pie plate and by the time we left there were two.  I've never come across another pizza place that crumbles their pepperoni and the perfect combination of thin crust, not too sweet or salty sauce and provolone cheese just works.    I refer back to the start of this review, you may not love-it but at least try it.  You never know when you may find your favorite memory and can pass it on and can retell the story later in life.",

My parents would round up my brother and I (usually a few additional playmates of ours too) and head down the hill from the house I grew up in to enjoy a pizza pie. I love the fact they had the old-school style pac-man game I nostalgically remember pumping money into and an old fashioned jukebox to boot. The Sir Pizza \"gimmic\", if you will, is a round pizza with square cuts. Thus the \"corner pieces\" are small and triangular (which were always my favorite pieces but I digress). The sausage and pepperoni is crumbled, not large slices, so be mindful of that if its not your cup of tea. The mushrooms come from a can too- it's pretty obvious from how they are limp and lack any flavor. You order at the counter and pick it up at the counter. They do have some nice craft beer but that's a more recent development. I don't see the fascination with this place, honestly, however, if you're not looking for a chain, options in this area are kinda limited. I definitely thought this pizza was awesome growing up, but only because I didn't know better. One star for being unique with the round pizza, square cuts and one star for nostalgia.",

    "text": "Sir Pizza is a North Hills staple. I've been eating here since 1st grade. The pizza is unlike others you've had. The toppings go to the edge and it's cut in to squares. Since the pizza is round, this means you get 4 \"corner\" pieces, which are actually triangles. Add some of the grated parmesan cheese and these are the best little bite. We've yet to deviate from the basic toppings... cheese, pepperoni, sausage, or pepperoni/sausage. It's just so yummy.  There are times when we go more than once in a week, so you may want to try something different. The white pizza is a nice change or the italian hoagie is good as well. Sometimes I get a hoagie and pizza because I want a little of both. Either way, yummy!!  I like that you can dine in and grab a pitcher of beer. It's a good casual place for a delicious bite to eat. If by chance you have some left over pizza, don't expect a box because you won't get one. Your pizza will be moved to smaller pizza round cardboard with and placed in a white paper bag. It sounds weird, but to those of us that go, it's totally normal.  FYI...they are packed on Friday nights. Go early or wait for the dinner crowd to die down. If all else fails, get it to go.",

It's the perfect thin crust pizza place, and im thankful that Sir Pizza (Ross Township) goes to great lengths to bring delicious circular pizzas cut into squares to the North Hills of Pittsburgh.  The crust is super thin, very flavorful cooked to perfection and crispy. Crispy but soft. Two very important factors in thin crust pizza. The ultimate reason I love sir pizza is that they crumble there pepperoni, I think it's the only pizza place I've ever been to that does it, and it is a game changer. No more greasy slices of underdone pepperoni - This pepperoni has a bite to it, it's just spicy enough, and it's super delicious.  I've been going to the Ross Park location for the last month while my kitchen is being renovated, and I have not had a bad experience once. This transcends not only the pizza and other products sold by Sir Pizza, but also to all of the employees that sir pizza employs- he clearly has a very specific profile of the people that he wants working for him and does a great job of hiring folks who were kind, courteous, and simply there to do their job. It feels like I'm family.  Not to mention the price! It's super affordable. Sir pizza clearly had his customers in mind when he set these prices.  Don't listen to the haters, this is good pizza, and I'm a pizza aficionado, if there was a 12 step program for pizza I would be a candidate",

Color me shocked, but the diced up pepperoni seems to be the PERFECT topping for their pies. Crispy crust, nice sauce and cheese with the salty pepperoni bits. Even better, their pizza held up fairly well reheated in the oven which is not an easy task. Shocking that some folks call this the best in the Burgh, but it is unique and something I would find myself craving.  $18 for a one topping pie with two smallish fountain drinks was a little more than I expected compared to other local shops, but I will definitely be back.",

And the wait usually isn't terribly long -for a eat in or carry out situation!  It's definitely \"not like the others\" but if that's what you're looking for...go to another chain pizza joint. The pizza is square cut and can come with a plethora of toppings! This place is quaint but that allows your to spend your time focusing on your family or friends that you are their with - not staring at a million TVs or running off to play some cheap video game.

There are three locations and when we went in, a woman was leaving and said to the staff, \"you guys make the best pizza in the world!\"   Going to go out on a limb here and say she hasn't been many places in the world. Or, like, Dominos.   To those who have compared the pizza to Totinos, you are right on the money. It's even served on cardboard discs!  And it's not super cheap or anything.   Pepsi products and broken arcade machines solidified a low rating from me. Will not be back.  I threw away my leftovers. All time low.",

If you're looking for a traditional pie, with a substantial crust, topped with mozzarella then this is not your spot. If you want an unorthodox square cut, round pie topped with provolone then give it a try. It's tasty but to me will never satisfy like a True pizza slice.",

Really a dollar each and a 2 oz souffle cup of sauce. 3.barely any cheese on the pizza 4. Way less pepperoni than a normal large 5. The hoagie should have came on bread that is how soft the bun is.  Honestly never again Fioris has my business.  I will drive in traffic for 45 minutes before I ever order here again",

    "text": "We went to SIr Pizza and were quite pleased with our visit.  We ordered a large plain pizza and a large Italian hoagie. The hoagie was prepared with several Italian meats, along with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and a tasty Italian dressing. It was quite flavorful. The hoagie was cut into 4 pieces, making it easy to eat. Crispy potato chips were served beside the hoagie. The large pizza was uniquely cut into numerous small rectangular pieces, making it quite easy to handle. It was excellent.  The atmosphere was fun and upbeat. A large TV screen was located on one of the walls. Old family wedding pictures adorned the \"La Famiglia\" wall. A large, older video game was available to play in the dining room. The restaurant was quite busy and a bit noisy. However, the restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly and efficient. I know that I'll return to this location in the future.",

The Royal Feast pizza was just okay, based on the taste I think this place would be great for kids parties though the prices are a bit high for the quality of pizza. I also tried the White Pizza and the tomatoes should have been cut up a bit or Roma tomatoes used instead so they would break down just a little bit more.",

    "text": "The variety of 1 star and 5 star reviews are pretty accurate. This place is definitely different from other pizza shops and I can see how people would like it, but myself and my family are not one of them. I've had square cut pizzas before so this is not some new novelty to me. I've also had other pizzas with the toppings ground/grated instead of sliced. Both methods are fine for my taste, so these specific things making Sir Pizza \"unique\" in the pittsburgh area did not influence my review, although some others might love or hate this aspect.  We bought a large pepperoni and large white pizzas. Here's my specific breakdown of both:  Pepperoni: The crust: It is not a \"thin\" crust, like a cracker or something similar from pizza hut or papa johns. It is a regular thickness, but has cheese and toppings to near the edge and is square cut, meaning there is no huge breadstick like crust on the end to hang onto. I like the to the edge topping, and I did not think it was freezer burnt or tough. It was light but crispy. Overall it was average. My wife however said it was terrible. If this crust was cut like a normal pizza into \"pie\" sections, I don't think people would think too much about it, but since it's square cut it gets a lot of attention.  Toppings: the pepperoni being grated/ground into small pieces was fine. Their website claims it is to distribute the flavor evenly. I've had this type of topping before and I have liked it in the past, but the pepperoni was a little bland. Overall, like the crust, average.  The sauce: This is where the pizza really took a hit. Some other reviews describe it as sweet, i agree with other reviewers that it is just bland. There is not flavor there. It was pretty bad. Add some spices guys.  Cheese: I like provolone on my pizza instead of mozzarella, which Sirs Pizza has. It's a higher quality and more expensive cheese. There's a reason the crappy $4 pizza at the super market has a big \"100% mozzarella\" label on it, because mozzarella is a cheap cheese. So I'm glad they use a better ingredient, they just put barely any on the pizza. To say the cheese is sparse is being kind.  White: The white pizza had the same crust and cheese as the pepperoni, so you either like it on both or you don't. where the white fell short again was in the sauce. I like my white to have a strong garlic taste, this was again bland. The tomato topping drown out the garlic flavor making it taste more like a bruschetta without only diced tomatoes and olive oil without any seasoning. Again average at best.  My wife said it was the worst pizzas she has ever had, saying she preferred Digorno, which I think is definitely over dramatic, but still, she hated it. I thought it was average, which made what I hated, THE PRICE, even worse. Two 14\" pizzas with 1 topping for $28. That should be gourmet, not meh.   So the wife hated it, the kids didn't like it but didn't hate it. I thought it was on par quality with a little caesars, which I can get for $5 each, not $12, so hard pass in the future. 3* for me, 1* for the wife equals 2* overall.   If you like toppings to the edge of your pizza, or square cut, or ground meats instead of sliced, you may like this place, but there is severe lack of overall flavor and the price doesn't make it nearly enough of a deal to overlook that. Look elsewhere.  I'm also from Pittsburgh so I'm not a NY pizza fascist that will never like anything from here ;)",
