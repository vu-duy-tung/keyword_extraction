    "text": "Nice atmosphere, good food - Sesame Inn gets an A in my book.  The service is good - I especially like the man who has been refilling water glasses since I was in middle school and always smiles at you.  There is a room off the main dining room to support larger groups, a full bar, and a great menu.  The lunch specials are very affordable, even to high school students, and can be packed on days when school lets out early.  As far as the food goes, everything is delicious.  The hot and sour soup is great, the ma po bean curd is the best I've ever had, and even their newest offering of pad thai is pretty good.  Whether you're taking out, eating in, or having food delivered, everything here is delicious.",

The Hunan Chicken was spicy without being too salty & the eggrolls were crisp but not greasy.  Only negative I'd give is to the hostess, who was a bit snarky when I ordered, but I'll give her some leeway based on the crowd that was there.  I'd go again.",

Even while sharing, we still take left overs home! Great!!!!",

The menus are all the same but there are subtle differences between each. For example, the kung pao chicken is breaded lightly at the Station Square location but is not at the Canonsburg location. Service is generally good and they are responsive to customized dishes or requests. Pretty good as far as Pittsburgh dining goes.",

The lunch menu is a great deal because it includes a soup or egg roll, so we usually try to go for lunch. The staff is always really friendly and quick.  My dad is a dentist in uptown Mt. Lebanon and even though this is a sit-down restaurant, you can always run in for a quick lunch and make it back to the office on time.   Take-out is very convenient too.  We often get take-out and it's usually ready to pick up around 15 minutes after you order it! I think the prices are pretty reasonable.  You can usually get lunch for under $10.  Dinner is a little pricier, but the dinners are definitely big enough for 2 people to share. On top of all that, the food is really good!  I've lived in LA for a year now and obviously there are a ton of places to get Chinese food out here, but I still think that Sesame Inn is my favorite!  I definitely highly recommend this place!  I know I'm always dying to eat here every time I'm in Pittsburgh!",

We went for lunch and found it to be unexpectedly busy (and parking was tight), but we were seated quickly.  Service was excellent.  Our server was very friendly and helpful and made sure our water glasses were always full and everything was to our liking.  The food was standard Chinese fare.  They also appeared to have a few Thai selections, although we did not try them.  Our entrees were nothing out of the ordinary, but the pu pu appetizer platter was quite delicious.  Meals are large and come with rice and soup for lunch.  Prices were reasonable for lunch, but are several dollars more for dinner.",

    "text": "This is my first yelp review. I set up a account just for this review.  I was deeply sadden by the food I received today.   I first started coming here since 1993. I have moved to Midwest four years later. However,  every times I drive thru Pittsburgh,I always stopped here. I really enjoy the general Tso' s chicken. As part of preparation, chicken was fried ahead of time,and fried again when you order, That is why their general Tso's Chicken was so crispy and aromatic when served. I did not have to make this stop, but after driving 450 miles, I wanted a decent meal.  Well, I stopped by and order the Dish for carry out. When I open them(it was not long, 30 minutes or less), they were so soggy, and based on my experience who grew up on Chinese food, it was not fried the second time. The difference? They tasted worse than Buffet dish sitting above the steamer for hours.   Furthermore, I have ordered the shrimp with garlic sauce. Shrimp was hard to chew. It seems like the shrimp the simmered in the sauce for ages. There was no aroma from garlic or onion.   Being a decent cook myself, I can tell you those dishes I ordered were not cooked by the main chef, or secondary chef. I suspect this is  probably made by the guy who station the fryer. Truly, the taste of those two dishes were so awful, I toss them out. I purchase those passing Pittsburgh, not really possible asking for refund.  I have had so much memory with this place. Rest assured, I won't be coming ever. It was so bad, I would not dear to try again.   I do hope the owner sees this, and make a statement of this incident. I eager to see you standby your dishes again. If I see owner's rebuttal, I would love to call the owner to discuss this encounter further, and willing to be convinced to come back.  Sincerely",

Personally I don't usually think of a dinner out at a Chinese Restaurant is going to be excellent but this place was Dyn-O-mite!   We had reservations for 6 people on a Saturday night around 7:00 but got caught up in really bad traffic and couldn't make it until closer to 7:45. we called to adjust our reservation time and they had no issue to accommodate us.   It is simple enough just to park across the street in the public lot than drive around for street parking I think that the lot may even be free on Saturday nights. The plate serving sizes are pretty large so it makes it easy for everyone to try a little of everything which is the way we ran the dinner with our group. We order way too much food to say the least. Everything was flavorful and served up[ hot and steamy. We had so many dishes that I can't talk about how awesome each one was but the one that really stood out to me was the mussaman curry and fried tofu.  Usually with a group of 6 or more a smaller place like this might be overwhelmed with getting the plates out in a timely manner and relatively close together but this place did an excellent job. I will definitely put this place in my places to go for dinner file after this experience.",

Myself and six other adults were not hallucinating, they were actually in our food. The kids had eaten before us and we did not notice until we sat down to eat. I called and the way the situation was handled was absolutely unbelievable.they told me I should have put the bugs in a bag. We left the bugs in the rice when we returned the food. They claimed they didn't see any. Seeing as though I am a regular customer who has never complained, I could not believe they would not refund my money for the food that we were unable to consume. I will NEVER ORDER feom sesame Inn Again. Totally disgusting..I worked in the restaurant business for many years and none of my managers would have handled this situation as poorly as they have.

Go in, and upstairs and it will be well worth the choice.  This was one of the best Chinese meals I've had in many, many years. The hot/sour soup was very good, the egg roll, also good.  We tried the 3 Rivers Roll - OMG....I'll be craving that for a very, very long time.  We also go General Tsao's chicken - chunks of white meat and nicely crispy, lo-main, shrimp and garlic and a seafood dish (yep, only 3 of us, so WAY too much).  Everything was fantastic.  We'd go back in a heartbeat!!!",

Plus, my chicken egg roll was amazing. BF's general tso shrimp was very good.   Minus, we each got a very little bowl of rice, and when we packed up our leftovers we had to ask for more rice and received very, very, little containers.   Another minus/plus, the flavor of my Capital Chicken was very good, a lot of chicken, good sauce, however, for $14, I had too many questionable pieces of chicken. I expect that from a cheap hole in the wall Chinese place where you pay $7, but for $14 and being the Sesame Inn, I definitely expected more!",

Back when I knew absolutely nothing about cuisine I loved Sesame and returning now as a hypercritical jerk I still like it. Yes, it's not healthy, and yes you may hate yourself after a huge portion of fried chicken or oily noodles, but as a guilty pleasure there are very few rivals in the South Hills.   The decor is frozen in time. The tea isn't fancy. The cuisine is inauthentic. But who really cares? Everyone is nice here and the fare tastes exactly as good as it is bad for any aspirations of health-consciousness. If you're really throwing caution to the wind then go for the fried egg roll and the wanton soup, both great, and be prepared to bring the majority of your entree back with you for another full meal or two. My one caveat would be that I don't like the non-Chinese features on the menu, i.e., go elsewhere for your Thai fix.   A final shout-out to whoever designed the cocktail list years and years ago. The little logos for each drink and the accompanying descriptions are hilarious. (Flaming Volcano - \"An eruption of the finest rums fired with sacred nectars served aflame...\") I hope that person went on to an illustrious career in marketing (or perhaps poetry) because these are amazing.",

Any appetizers include coconut shrimp, egg rolls, crab Rangoon, bbq ribs and chicken teriyaki sticks. From all I got I ate chicken and ribs cause everything else was over fried, old & not fresh...

    "text": "I have a unexpected love affair with seasme inn that started one night on account of take out and has been growing ever since. Seriously if you're looking for delicious American- Chinese food without all of the grease and questionable meat items- you'd be crazy not to try and fall in love with this place.   I've never actually eaten in at the Mt Lebo location, I always just get take out because it is so close to my house. Typically, I order the General tsos chicken for me and the string beans with chicken for my fiance- both come with steamed white rice.   The portions are extremely generous, literally enough for two meals worth. The pieces of chicken are always huge and REAL- again not strange is this or is this not chicken that you might get from other Chinese take out places. The quality of the food is top notch and honestly though the prices are more steep than other Chinese restaurants it's 100% worth it for the quantity and quality you get.   Also, each time I've gotten take out their staff have always been really friendly. Actually, when I give my number they have my past orders on file so if I'm re- ordering my go-to's (noted above) then it's a quick and easy phone call.   Overall, love this place and I will continue to go here until my love affair burns out (which I don't see happening).",

    "text": "Sesame Inn's stylized, fiery red signage and pagoda-shaped awning averted our gazes as we drove up Washington Road in search of unYelped eats. Entering its doors, we walked up a flight of stairs towards a commodious, white banquet hall of a dining room with sculptures and Oriental musical instruments furbishing the interiors.   Sesame Inn is a local chain of somewhat upscale Asian restaurants with an emphasis on Chinese favorites, all of which I've seemingly had before in varying permutations. Deciding to eschew the familiar during a recent visit to this posh, penthouse-like location in luxurious Mt. Lebanon, I treated Kay and myself to some sushi and a sampling of Thailand.   Kamikaze Rolls opened the proceedings with a tempura-battered flair and bombast. An artistically stacked and embellished sextet of bronze medallions filled with smoked salmon, cream cheese, tamago, avocado, and asparagus dazzled our taste sensors with a blend of richness, creaminess, tartness and a crunchy yet elegant mouthfeel. Earth-toned ribbons of various smooth, mayonnaise-based (?) sauces or condiments further enhanced the deep-fried fantasy like suds unleashed during a rave.  This is why sushi still captivates in spite of its now mainstream status.   Desiring an entree I'd yet to try, I opted for a bazaar of a dish in Mussaman. My chosen protein of shrimp may have been what the course was centered around, but it was the exquisitely sour tamarind that truly made it shimmer albeit subtly. Onions, pineapple, string beans, and potatoes would make the Mussman nourishing while tamarind brought the sass, peanuts provided texture, and coconut milk tamed whatever magical fires the curry mischievously ignited.   With above par service, ornate environs, exemplary food, and moderate pricing, one is reminded that PF Chang's is blasphemy and that Asian cuisine is better on lavish plates in restaurants than it is in cardboard cartons at home.  P.S. Sesame Inn does a nifty Sunday brunch that costs between $11 and $13 a head and includes  soup, salad (or egg roll), a beverage (champagne costs just $1 extra), and an entree.",

You have to go upstairs to get to the restaurant but the little climb is so worth it. The decor here is very inviting, not bare and minimalist like many other Chinese restaurants and the restaurant is very clean. Everything I've had here has been delicious and fresh. Surprisingly, the pad Thai is good here too. I, however, have never ordered sushi here as it wasn't always part of their menu. Delicious, high quality American-Chinese restaurant.",

After waiting about ten minutes for our waitress to come to the table, I asked the hostess if we could get service and she assured me that the waitress would be on her way over. She seemed to be the only server working.   The crazy tuna roll was lacking flavor, and the soy sauce tasted like there was ten lbs of salt in it.   The shrimp with \"lobster sauce\" and brown rice was disappointing to say the least. It was $18 and had no flavor what so ever, I asked hot sauce to it just so I could eat it and feel somewhat fulfilled.   Would not recommend this restaurant, mainly because there are other comparable restaurants that are much better within walking distance. This is sad because I believe the sesame in a little further down Rt. 19 is much, much better.",

We began with vegetable egg rolls - they were delicious and a nice size. The spicy mustard got rave reviews from my fellow diners.  For our main course, our party of 3 split: eggplant chicken, orange beef, and chicken pad Thai. All of the portion sizes were large and even after stuffing ourselves we had leftovers. The orange beef was my favorite of the three - very flavorful though a little sweet. The eggplant in the chicken dish was cooked perfectly. I do, however, wish there had been more tofu dishes. While it's not the best Chinese food I've ever had, it's up there! If I'm ever in the area again with a craving for orange beef, I'll definitely stop by.",

To reach the Sesame Inn, you go up a flight of stairs and there is a large seating area and bar. The Sesame Inn is a typical Chinese food joint which offers your \"traditional\" Chinese dinners and sides and also has a variety of sushi's and Thai food. There are weekend specials and and lunch specials and the menu is large enough that anyone can find something. I'd recommend the amazing chicken as a top dish. The chicken truly is amazing - perfectly battered and served with the appropriate amount of sauce and flavor. All dinner portions are very generous and the quality is as good as expected. With a street full of Mediterranean, Mexican and Asian restaurants, the Sesame Inn more than holds its own.",

Definitely will be our top choice for a casual sit down meal in the future!  Our waitress was super friendly and on top of everything. She explained items to us that we needed clarification on & made suggestions for items when we couldn't decide!  We got the Golden Gate roll as our appetizer because I'm not a fan of the raw sushi (I know that's annoying). But it was delicious! Six large pieces of slightly spicy sushi with sliced shrimp on top that was very fresh & looked great! I'd recommend this for sure!   We then ordered the lo mein noodles with roasted pork, as well as the General Tsos chicken with white rice to each share.  Our waitress recommended the roasted pork over the standard pork as she described it to be a BBQ type of taste & deeper roasted flavor which was spot on. The lo mein noodles had a nice soy/teriyaki flavor with lots of pork, sliced mushrooms, green onions, bamboo shoots, and carrots. Delicious & a nice portion for the price.  The general Tsos chicken was very good - a bit stickier than I'm used to, and not spicy AT ALL. If I were to order this again, I'd ask for some heat because it was very sweet.  The white rice was fresh & yummy.  This was definitely a solid, high quality Chinese meal with a great atmosphere & top notch customer service. Check this place out the next time you are craving some sushi or Chinese cuisine!",

The price is higher than most Chinese places however and the portions were a little small for me (I have a big appetite) - I guess that is why they call it fine dining but I still think it isn't the greatest deal for the price.   Only other thing is that their wasn't enough vegetable based dishes - the vegetables that I did eat were completely delicious but there just wasn't enough of them! I also feel like they give you way too much meat (even though the meat is delicious) but maybe that is just me.  I would not hesitate to go back here nonetheless and would recommend this place highly to others who might not mind paying a little more for higher quality food or who don't require a vegetable based diet. If this place could make more vegetable based dishes and either give me a bigger portion or lower their price I will not hesitate to increase my review to a perfect 5 out of 5 stars :)",

Starting with the beauty Alaska rolls which are fresh and the salmon had a smoked flavor. I would give this 4/5 because I found the sauce to be overwhelming, but with appropriate quantities, the rolls were tasty. They offer 8 rolls. The price was reasonable for the quality and quantity.   The chicken fried rice was tasty but the chicken looked dry and unappetizing. The fried rice minus chicken is a good dish with appropriate amounts of spice and seasoning along with veggies. I will give this a 4/5.   The salt and pepper shrimp to me looked like a fried shrimp with some salt and pepper sprinkled over it. They served the shrimp over a bed of lettuce and garlic accompanied by few broccoli. The combination didn't appeal to me. In addition, the shrimp tasted like fried dough that lacked seasoning. Though the shrimp seemed to be good quality, the dish as a whole didn't impress me. I would give this a 2/5.   The sesame chicken consisted of chunks of well cooked and seasoned chicken covered with sweet sesame sauce and topped with sesame seeds served over fried noodles. Based on the instructions on the menu, we thought this would be a spicy dish, but it ended up being a sweet dish. The person who took our order didn't tell us about the difference. However, I still liked the dish. The texture was sticky and mushy and the chicken pieces were too big. My rating for this dish is 3/5.   I don't think I will go back again since I prefer Sichuan flavors. However, if you like American version of Chinese food, I recommend this place.",

    "text": "Went here for a Mother's Day - never again!  I had called to make my reservation for their earliest time slot, 12 noon.  When we arrived Sunday expecting brunch, as their website mentioned, the waiter told us there was no brunch, even though our Sesame Inn menu included a brunch menu.  Then when we asked about the lunch offerings, also in the restaurant menu, we were told there was no lunch option - only dinner entrees.  This was noon.  And it wasn't what their website said.  Nor was it ever conveyed to me during our 3 phone calls (2 from the restaurant reminding me of my reservation).   Our food took forever to arrive and was barely warm.  It was so sweet my sister in law could barely eat hers.  In addition, our waiter screwed up my brother's order - substituting chicken for his Shrimp entree.    If misleading customers from your website and menu is okay; and then not delivering what customers order is okay, then by all means this is a fine place.",

    "text": "Went to Sesame Inn in Mt. Lebanon this evening. Purchased a bottle of wine with full course meal. Manager would not allow me to take the remaining wine home with me. Explained that PA Liqour Control Board passed law, Act 59 that states that any restaurant with liquor license may allow patron to take home remaining portion of bottled wine if recorked. Manager would not allow me to leave with the wine. $35 down the drain unless they plan on \"reselling\" the wine. Will be contacting the sate. This seems very unseemly.",

The atmosphere is very cozy and calm.   The sushi bar sits in a cozy part of the restaurant. The staff are wonderful and attentive. Very friendly. The only con is that I didn't notice an elevator and there are quite a few steps to walk up. The restarting sits on a second floor. Take out is available.",

    "text": "As much as I like to avoid a franchise restaurant, this is one of our go-to place for american-Chinese cuisine. I guess I'll take solace in the fact that I am still supporting a local franchise :)   The place itself is pretty spacious and ideal for groups. They have two different seating areas including a full bar at the main area. The place is clean and the servers and service so far has been pretty good.  The food especially their in house specialties and traditional dishes are really good. No disrespect to the chef but if you're in the mood for the Pad thai or Sushi - I suggest you go to a thai or a Japanese restaurant.  So far during my visit here, I've had the Mongolian Beef/Pork, Amazing Chicken, General Tso ofcourse, Sesame Chicken, Mapo Tofu, Singaporean Noodles (don't recommend), Fried Rice, Lomein to name a few. I highly recommend the Mongolian Beef or Pork. Also, the portions served during the dinner hours are huge and reasonably priced - so order accordingly.",

Vegetable eggs roll, which was ok but I'd like to try a different variety next time, it was a bit boring. I tried the egg drop soup which was great for my cold but not exactly a traditional egg drop soup. It had peas and carrots added which I've never seen before but it tasted delicious.  We also got the sesame noodles which was a cold salad appetizer. My fiance LOVED it. I thought it was good too very peanuty and yummy. Finally he got the Mongolian beef and I got the sesame shrimp. The shrimp was soooo good, a little spicy but not crazy by any means. I would definitely get it again. And the beef was delicious  too!   They were super nice and everything came out fast. It was a good visit. We'll be back.",
