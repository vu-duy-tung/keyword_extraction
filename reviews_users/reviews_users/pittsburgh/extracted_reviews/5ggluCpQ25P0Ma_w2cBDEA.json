My favorite is how they chop the salad to your request personally I like small bites. The citrus vinigrette (may have been lime) is really good and the \"salad maker\" asks you how much dressing you want...it comes out perfect every time!  I'm such a salad lover!  Wish it was all healthy but I love my cheese.  Not sure who is ordering burgers here I mean really you burger ordering loonies its all about salad here.",

I understand they have rules but we all know avocado is one of the more expensive toppings so I felt that was an even sub.

French fries were nicely crisp and flavorful.  Service was poor--surly cashiers and a twenty-minute wait for any order with a milkshake--and burgers sat getting soggy until the shakes were ready. Perhaps due to the lunch rush, but still not a great experience.  The salad assembly line is the restaurant's centerpiece, I'll go back to try one--but there are much better burgers to be had for a similar price Downtown. Definitely not worth the wait and the crowd.",

    "text": "This is the place for salads!  A giant river of toppings to choose from, fresh greens, giant bowl, and they'll chop your salad for you if you wish.  I had a small side salad, premade with greens, tomato, cucumber, cheese.  The Citrus Lime dressing is perfect....not too puckery or sweet, doesn't hide the flavors of the vegs.  I will absolutely get salads here in the future.  My burger wanted to be great.  It looked fantastic. The Big Honkin' Superburger, a double-decker with \"Sauce Supreme\", one patty was still incredibly red inside so I removed it.  The sauce really is nothing more than a very thin skim of tartar sauce.  It couldn't hide the fact that although the meat looked good and had a nice, juicy chew, there was no flavor to the meat.  None.  I saved a bite for later just to be sure, and nope, no flavor.  This is where the Eat 'n Park relationship is obvious. Your burger will need mustard, ketchup, or something.  My friend had the Over-Easy Cheeseburger, cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and an egg.  He said it was \"alright\" but less than expected.  The fries are very good, fried in peanut  oil.  My order was to go, so the fries were a bit limp but that was likely because they were in a bag for ten minutes. A lot of fries for just $2.  Milkshakes, chocolate and vanilla, are very standard.  Go to the Milkshake Factory at 17th and Carson for your shakes.  I plan on trying the breakfast sandwiches, and the Boylan soda fountain next time.  I do wish they'd have some pastries or muffins for breakfast....they just have those terrible Smiley cookie pucks.  I remain hopeful.  Eat 'n Park is the absolute worst chain restaurant I've ever been to, It makes Denny's taste gourmet. Hello Bistro needs to further distance themselves from Eat 'n Park and get some flavor in those burgers.  But if you're looking for a SALAD, this is your place.",

I have been to the Oakland location and enjoyed the entire experience- food and customer service- so I was looking forward to lunch. My actual meal was fine (American Grill burger and fries). It was the customer service that left much to be desired. My sister ordered a custom salad. She had an important phone call come through and asked me to finish her order. The girl making the salad (Caitlin) was extremely unfriendly. Rudely asking \"what else\" and acting annoyed when I had to think about it (mind you - the place was NOT busy at all so it's not like I was holding up a line). When we came to the end of the line, she plopped the salad down and just stared at me. When I asked what else she needed to know she said \"I have more questions for her\" and just stared at my sister who had stepped aside. I responded that I knew what to order. She made no eye contact, finished the salad, and plopped it on the counter for me to take. No \"thank you\" or \"have a nice day\" or anything. I won't be back.",

I ordered the Superburger special-a Superburger, fries, and your choice of a fountain drink or a PBR. (The weirdest part of Hello Bistro is that they serve beer. They don't in their restaurants.). My son ordered a Buffalo Blue burger. Our meals came out on silver metal trays the size of old school frozen dinners. Our burgers were hot and juicy. The fries came in a paper bag. They were hot and salty. We both liked our meals. The only down side is that our table was not clean. Of course we bought Smiley cookies to munch on while we walked around Carson.",

Restaurant was clean, cool, and clearly laid out.  Only a few other patrons at that hour on that day.  I got their Soba Salmon Salad and wife made her own.  Kids got cheeseburgers w/ fries and (excellent, more natural) Boylan soda (all for $5 for each kid).  Burgers were good, simple, but good quality.  Fries were plentiful and excellent, fresh-cut, and well-seasoned (not overly seasoned).  Ketchup (Heinz, of course) and their house-made (semi-famous) ranch dressing for dipping.  Wife's salad had all the ingredients she could choose, and her eyes got big.  Picked her bed of greens, toppings galore (beets two ways made her day), asked for salmon (but we agreed she probably didn't need it since everything else provided abundant flavor/substance).  Some crispy and fruity toppings near the end of the bar.  Got to sample a dressing before committing to one.  They chopped it all up for her and handed her a bowl that was HEAVY.  Didn't really finish the whole thing because the portion ended up being enormous.  The only negative thing was that they were out of cookies, maybe because it was so late in the day.  We thought about asking for fruit as a substitute, but passed.",

I asked her to ask the manager. She huffed and looked over at him and asked, he then was rude and said, \"there's no oil in the dressing, it's cream based.\" I said, I need to see the ingredients. He then got an attitude and I said, \"you're not going to show me?\" My boyfriend then asked to see the chef or manager, he then said, \"hold on\" and he looked at a menu. He didn't speak up and I thought he said no soy, and then he got rude and said, \"yes. Theres.

I was a bit overwhelmed by all of the options, but I went with a veggie burger and fries. My boyfriend got one of their salads.   The salad process is probably the most notable and unique part of Hello Bistro. There are tons of choices for your salad starting with a variety of healthy greens. There's just about every veggie you could hope for, a lot of nuts and seeds and a variety of cheese toppings. The dressings are yummy too - he chose chipotle lime vinaigrette. All of the ingredients looked fresh and recently prepped. That's a plus, since it's easy to let those items sit out all day.   My veggie burger was large and filling. It tasted phenomenal, too. The crispy fries were skinny and flavorful. The order of fries is large enough to share between two or three people depending on how much of a fry monger you are.   One of my favorite parts of Hello Bistro is probably the fountain sodas. They're real sodas without icky chemicals. Creme soda and birch beer soda from a fountain? Dream come True. I mixed the creme soda and ginger ale together for a really tasty combination. They aren't anymore expensive than your average fountain drink, either.   Hello Bistro is my new obsession. I'm pretty excited to go back, and I think next time I'll get one of those salads. The only downside is that it is kind of pricey for what you get. Two sodas, a salad, a veggie burger and fries ran us about $30. For \"fast\" food, it's a bit steep. Though, the quality and customer service really outweighs any negatives here.",

Had a breakfast sandwich the first time, and it was all bagel with little-to-no egg or meat. My girlfriend and I both got burgers the second time, and they were very disappointing given the hype they indicate on the menu and signage. Burgers were small, bland, and way over cooked. Best part was the bun, which engulfed and otherwise paltry piece of meat. Fries were awesome.   -Timing: took way, way too long. I understand the \"fresh\" aspect of the food, and respect that greatly, but if I knew I was going to wait 15 minutes for 2 small burgers in an otherwise empty restaurant, I would have gone somewhere else.   - Staff: somewhat friendly, but were much more worried about socializing in a group in the back corner.   -Atmosphere: awesome, great feel! Really like how they bring the food to you, even though it took much, much longer than expected.   Overall, I'm not sure I'd try Hello Bistro again. There are plenty of other options in the South Side, and I'll likely be taking my daily business elsewhere.",

Having heard from friends that they are known for their salads I decided to get the Jamaican shrimp salad and I couldn't resist a side of french fries.    I was disappointed in my salad as it was mainly leaves...I was hard pressed to find morsels of corn, black beans or avocado.  I feel like there was the same number of shrimp as there were black beans...now this might sound like a good thing to you considering how small black beans are and theoretically how many they could have poured on the salad but I think I counted 7 black beans in my salad...most were timidly hiding behind the numerous lettuce leaves that seemed to be overwhelming the bowl.  The dressing was lightly spread across all the leaves which I enjoyed rather than in a glob on top of the salad.     The real highlight was the french fries.  They give them to you in a bag...like anyone needs a bag of french fries.  But they sure were tasty, very fresh - you could tell them came right out of the fryer.  And they were thin - all in all the highlight of my meal.",

Even the prices weren't bad, compared to other places where you may not get choices as fresh as the ones at Hello Bistro. Very comparable (even a little cheaper than some).   When I go back to the area, I will absolutely be visiting Hello Bistro again - I may even have to try the location on Forbes for dinner, too. :-)",

You order at the counter, take a number card, and then your food is delivered to your table. As a bonus, they bus your tables after you're done eating. It was quite crowded for lunch today, but the turnover was quick and there were always tables available, so I was impressed.  I found the fries to be a bit greasy but a great deal at $2 for a large paper bag of them. I see some late-night snacking to be done here.   The salads are the real winner here. Big bowls overflowing with fresh veggies and meat in any combination you can imagine (or you can cheat like me and pick one of their standards.) It's a tad on the expensive side for casual fast food, but probably one of the healthiest lunch options on the South Side if you stick to their salads.   Overall, this will make a nice addition to South Side lunch options and an easy quick dinner option when you want a burger or a salad. The tin-style ceiling, exposed brick, and general niceness of the decor also take it a step up for your average lunch fare.",

I used to frequent the Oakland location when I worked at UPMC Presbyterian, so when they opened a spot just a half block from my apartment, I was thrilled!  Hello Bistro is owned by the Eat 'N Park group, so you'll find similar menu items here - including the delicious, world famous (well, at least in my opinion) SuperBurger.    If you're in the mood for something a little healthier, their salad combinations are endless!  One trick I've learned is to ask them to chop up the lettuce before adding any toppings.  Since most of the toppings are already diced, they tend to get mushed during the chopping phase - asking them to do that step first creates the perfect salad! There is an additional, nominal upcharge to add protein to your salad, but aside from that, you can add as many toppings as your hungry heart desires!  You can easily get out of there for $10 per person, including a beverage.  They even offer classic fountain sodas, which is a nice touch!  The Southside location has a giant front window that they open in the warmer months for some al fresco dining, so if you can, grab a seat in front of the window for some glorious people watching ;)",

My coworkers and i stopped going to this location for a while due to the slow service and decided to try it again today. Nothing has changed and it may have gotten worse. The service was extremely slow, so much that my coworker and I waited 20 minutes (at least) after we paid to even have our salads made. To top it off, I ordered a salad from the menu (buffalo chicken), and it was less than okay. The amount of chicken put into the salad was barely anything, and I looked away for 2 seconds only to find out when I got back to eat my salad at the office that tomatoes were added. My receipt clearly said no tomato. I paid 9+ dollars for extremely slow service, barely any chicken, and realizing my order was incorrect after getting back to eat it. I had waited for so long it wasn't even worth going back to let the employees know. It appears there is no system happening here, and not even one apology for the slow service. In fact, everyone seemed pretty unhappy. I don't think I'll be going back for a while, but I've given it many chances.",

I could honestly eat here everyday and never get tired of it. Every time I go, they have new salad bar additions - kale/spinach mix, wheat berries, asparagus, etc - that shows the owners really like to keep innovative. I'm sure if this were in a more health conscious city (that doesn't put fries on everything) this place would be booming, similar to Sweet Green. But they will always have my loyalty!",

Their to go quarts are priced extremely reasonable, pick up is fast, the foods consistent for diner fare.   I have tried Hello Bistro multiple times and have finally given up on them. I'll drive to one of the E&P's near the city before I try Hello Bistro again.  Let's start with the soup- it's the exact same soup sold at Eat N Park, yet priced over $1 more per quart.  Why?!?  Same with many other items, pricier yet not close to being as good as the standard Eat N Park.  How can a place that has everything in place to be awesome, screw up burgers and gourmet grilled cheeses?... Try Hello Bistro and you can find out.   Kids meals- how is it that a place that has 50+ salad fixings, serves every kids meal with fries?! And the kids meals are the same as Eat N Park but twice the price without any healthy side options. Serving milk doesn't make French fries healthy. It's just goofy and not urban family minded.  Mind you, my toddlers $5 grilled cheese was acceptable in his opinion. It's nice to have your kids dinner cost $1.25 per bite. (Those w small kids will understand)  The fries were given to the dogs, who thoroughly enjoyed them. I tasted one and thought they were gross. I much preferred when I bought my kid the same sandwich at the Ohio River Blvd Eat N Park w a side of grapes and the total was a little over $2.   The customer service in this location is just- blah.  I don't expect perfection. Things happen. Ingredients run out, but I'm never made to feel like this location actually feel cares if my order can't be filled in its entirety.   I've tried. I've tried more than once. I've given up.  Our last two orders were just beyond not good, awkward and disappointing.",

I also dislike 80% of all salad dressing as well. Hello Bistro is great though, the Salads are large and their pre-set menus are fantastic. I always order the Chicken fiesta (mixed greens, Corn, tortilla strips, chicken, green and red peppers, red onion, avocado and blackbeans, i request no jalapenos tho) the dressing really makes it amazing and they mix up all the greens and dressing together so the flavors really permeate through the entire bowl. They're pretty ample with the toppings and you can request less/more of the basic stuff to suit you. I always have to take half of it home because of its large size.  I also had the burgers which are decent and the chili which is hearty and they offer boylan soda which is greatttt. I like the fries alot (even if shoestring is not my preferred) they're served in brown paper bags but i wish they'd have more large pieces because half my order is always the overfried tiny bits that just taste like salt. I've tried this location and downtown, Southside's is far superior in service and quality.",

The option to customize your own salad is awesome, while their menu salads are unique and take the hassle out of having to decided among 55 salad toppings. My usual is the Caribbean Shrimp at $9.50 it consists of  Mixed Greens + Seasoned & Roasted Shrimp + Avocado + Black Beans + Corn + Tortilla Strips with Citrus Lime Vinaigrette very filling and refreshing. I recently took advantage of their online ordering feature and it was an easy and I liked that I could opt to pay cash upon pick up! I've been to both the Oakland and South Side locations prefer South Side, way better seating. And I LOVE that they have birch beer fountains drinks, takes me back!",

I love the staff here! They are always welcoming and friendly. I feel like I am picky with what I want on my salad, and they have always understood that with a smile! The service is always quick and super fresh, and anything I have had here was good.   First time I tried Hello Bistro I got their Turkey Burger with mango salsa, and boy was that tasty!! No need for mustard or ketchup, which is shocking for me. Everything had so much flavor! I also ordered fries on the side which came in a brown paper bag - super neat. I love the fries also! They are thinner which I like and most places don't have that.  Now for the reason that I am totally in love with this place - their salads! They have salads you can pick from, create your own, or a mix of both. I always got the buffalo chicken salad. I customized it as I don't like blu cheese, but wanted to add this or that. It was never an issue! The salad comes with grilled chicken and the sauces/dressed is already mixed in with the greens once they bring the salad to you. Im sure you can ask for the dressing on the side, but I like that I didn't have to make a mess trying to mix in my dressing. Plus it is always perfect amount of buffalo sauce and dressing.   Honestly crave the salads from there and I wish there was a closer location to me! I can only hope they will expand and I can enjoy this deliciousness one again more conveniently!",

I'm also a big fan of Hello Bistro in general, so win-win!   You have two options when ordering here: use their standard menu OR make your own meal. Granted, customizable meals are available seemingly everywhere these days. Hello Bistro, however, is a go-to of mine because makes it easy to satisfy a number of food cravings in one place.  Salads? Check. (Bonus points for large and AFFORDABLE salads, by the way!) Burgers? Got 'em. Soup and fries? Yes and yes! They also have a variety of drinks to choose from - think flavored water, Pepsi products, iced teas, that sort of thing.  This location is also well maintained. The tables are cleared promptly, the staff are very nice, and it's just a nice place to sit and catch my breath post-workout. Parking isn't always the easiest, but that's South Side for you.  I'm a fan and I'll definitely be visiting this location on an ongoing basis - climbing makes me hungry and Hello Bistro is the perfect remedy for that!",

I chose not to make my own this time, I may do this but he next visit. I ordered the fiesta chicken salad minus avocado. I thought it was a good tasting salad. I was not sold on the dressing but it didn't make me not like the salad. There was a good combination of lettuce, chicken and toppings like corn black beans and peppers.  It took a really long time for our salads.  I didn't think to time our wait but it definitely was much longer than I expected. This is my main reason for not 5 stars. The restaurant itself was clean and I was able to maneuver my stroller and sleeping kid around easily. I look forward to my next salad from hello bistro.",

This all changed though with my recent visit to Hello Bistro. I ordered a salad with chicken and it was around $10. Not bad! I love getting the salad because  1) it's HUGE. Like meals for 3 days huge.  2) it's fresh. You can see how fresh everything is because they make it right in front of you  3) they chop it up so finely. I'm a weirdo when it comes to salads and I love them finely chopped and I love that they ask you how you want it.   This salad was seriously perfect. I'm so obsessed with hello bistro and I definitely have a better taste in my mouth after this visit. The employees got all of their stuff together and were SO polite. They'd actually cared about what I wanted, and they SMILED. I will definitely be back!",

The fries were pretty good, too, but were also pretty greasy. I dipped them in their ranch, which the best fast food ranch I've had.  The potato soup is great! Just the right amount of richness.  The staff at this location is also awesome. The man who took out order was friendly and helpful. As We waited for our order several staff people asked how we were and made small talk which was great!   Over all this is a great fast casual restaurant prefect for a quick lunch.",

The build your owns are just a standard price of $8 and obviously extra for protein. The salads are a good size too. They always fill me up and I hardly ever add protein. If you do add protein don't expect it to be high quality. Cold small pieces of chicken which doesn't look appetizing to me. They also have a nice selection of dressings as well. They mix and chop the salads in small, medium, or large bites for you which I love. The fries are good but other than fries and salads I've never tried their other food. They have sandwiches and burgers too. I recommend ordering online for lunch and go pick it up. They make it so convenient! Just place your  order online and pay then walk in and grab the bag on the counter with your name on it. All the toppings for the build your own salads are listed online, it's way too easy! As I've said I've been many times and the salads always taste good. Every once in a while I'll get an occasional salad that isn't up to par but for the most part they are consistent.

I went all the way back and they just casually handed me a different bag with my order. Eh. Annoying. So yesterday I went in and instead of going the usual salad route, I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich (to go). I stood over by the spot where take out is ready and watched the cook come out of the bathroom. He dried his hands on his pants and then went to the kitchen to cook. He grabbed the bread out of the bag with his bare hands, and then separated the cheese from the stack (again, no gloves). Is this common practice? It's probably better for me to just not be able to see what's happening in restaurant kitchens. I really had to choke that sandwich down after what I saw. Meanwhile, it's funny that the people chopping the salads wear gloves. They aren't even touching the food. It's almost like the gloves are for show. I did notice the guy that took my money was gloved, so I'm guessing that pair isn't providing the same cleanliness barrier we'd hope for after he handles money.   So all this to say, I'm probably not going to stop coming here, but I'm disappointed that it's not what I thought.",

Having never been here before, and after my friend, Franny, asked like four times in a row to go there, I found myself looking at Hello Bistro's burger/sandwich menu on a really nice evening in June. I ordered the regular Bistro Burger, a cheeseburger with all the fixing's. For $2 more, I added a bag of fries (amazing BTW) and a Boylan's soda. If you've never had Boylan's, you need to try it. I've never seen it in a fountain before, but it was equally as good as the bottles I've found elsewhere in the area.   We sat outside to people watch and wait for our food. They nicely brought it the whole way out! :) Back to the food; the burger was great, juicy and cooked just right. Toppings were perfect, too, crispy lettuce and a ripe tomato. Fries were in a little bag, and AANNDD, they have Eat N' Park's Ranch Dressing (the number one condiment of all time) on a chilled pump at the condiment station. I'm not going to be bashful here, I had 2 whole cups of it with my fries. I'll make up for it, I said, by running a little further tonight, and I did. :-P Sorry, got side tracked there; the fries were great. spiced and crispy, just the way I like them.  I recommend people watching while you stuff your face with burger. I enjoy it, and the people watching is great on Carson Street. So many weirdo's.   Happy Eating!",

Their employees were friendly and willing to help.  My order was the Sesame Soba Salmon Salad. Their website menu lists it as: Kale + Spinach + Salmon + Soba Noodles + Avocado + Edamame + Sesame Seeds x Thai Peanut Dressing. If you look at the picture online and look at what I had...a bit of inconsistency, but that's to be expected since pictures for websites are meant to look appealing. I did get a lot of kale, few leaves of spinach, sesame seeds, lots of edamame, one slice of avocado, bits of noodles (no whole noodles..they appeared chopped), and chopped pieces of salmon. The dressing was delicious and the whole salad tasted really good together, which is why I'm a fan of this place. I would have liked whole noodles in my salad, but hey..maybe next time.  I also got a bottle of water and a fruit bowl. Their fruit bowls are my favorite because it's not a little cup filled with two kinds of fruit. It's an actual bowl size with fresh, chopped fruit like mango, apples, strawberries, and a few other kinds of fruit that I can't recall at the moment. It was fabulous.",

    "text": "I've lived in south side over a year, but my first visit to the Southside HB wasnt until recently.  The reason is that when the entire business was brand new in oakland, we ate there like 4 times a month.. after church, after work.. whatever.. Not to mention lunch at the downtown location .  My friend stopped in to see me and heard great things about HB. I wanted to show her the cultural shops in southside so we decided to stick there for lunch  Anyone who is new to HB.. its a giant salad bar. They have a menu with salads already thought up by HB (Salads by Us). They also have tons of toppings and you can make up your own salad (Salads by You) HB also has a menu full of sandwiches & burgers (EnP Super Burger is delish). Their fries are fresh cut and they have a freaking ranch dispenser with EnP ranch. They also sell Boylan soda and omg the ginger ale is amazing.  My friend and I both ordered the Apple Almond Crunch.. romaine, grilled chicken, granny smith apples, blue cheese, almonds served with an apple cider vinaigrette. The salad was delicious. I subbed mixed greens for the romaine and mozzarella for blue cheese since im not a fan of that. The dressing was delicious and the salad was light yet so sooo filling.  We also ordered fries and EnP ranch to share. Yaas",

    "text": "The food is OK, the experience could use some work. I come in every few months to give Hello Bistro's South Side location another chance, and am usually let down and then avoid Hello Bistro's South Side location for another few months until I forget about the whole thing. Their salads are hit-and-miss, so when you find something you like, stick with it!  The burgers are simple and creative, the grilled cheeses hit the spot, and the soups are a good alternative to fries or a side-salad. I came in with a birthday coupon (thanks!) and the staff that greeted me didn't seem too thrilled about any of it and it caused a bit more complication that it helped.  For fast-casual or for takeout, Hello Bistro is definitely a quick spot and easy decision. I'm just always left wanting a bit more.",

    "text": "It's the Boylan's soda fountain that keeps me coming back for more! I mean, I love the concept of this place with made to order salads. But man, do I love me some Boylan's Cream Soda! Only thing that woulda made this experience perfect is if they had diet cream soda. It only comes in black cherry, which is a strong second in my book. But let's get serious. There's more to this place than Boylan's (I guess:).  I may have said this in my Oakland Hello Bistro review, but it still blows my mind that Pittsburgh doesn't have more, if any, made to order salad places. It seems that in NYC there's one on every block. So you'd think that would trickle down to Pittsburgh at some point. Finally it has, with Eat n' Parks version.  Which means the best of Eat n' Park! That includes their superburger and grilled cheese. If only they had grilled stickies it would complete the trifecta! But coming here I try to stick to MOSTLY (see: Boylan's obsession) salads, since they do them right.  I love the fact that they toss in what you want, how much dressing you need and mix it. Those are always the main problems when you get a salad to go. I opted for their choice of the Caribbean Shrimp Salad. I thought it was good, but not quite what I had remembered it to be. THEN, I tried my friends salad dressing, the citrus chipotle BBQ, and went, danggit, I should have switched things up! It was gooood! My bad. Next time I'm doing things differently. But somehow I still think its going to be tasty. And as long as they have friendly service (which they did) and Boylan's soda, I'm sold!  I'm glad there's now one in South Side too because I didn't think there were a lot of healthy, fast local options. I'll be stopping for my soda and salad again soon!",

    "text": "This might be super petty to write a review about this, but it has me super annoyed. I asked the young, short, dark haired girl who made my salad of she could put two more mozzarella balls on my salad. She said no, we are only supposed to put 4 to 5 on a salad. So I could ask for every different cheese on the salad, but I can't have 2 more mozzarella balls?? I've been in the restaurant business for 20 years... and I've learned that it's better to just appease the customer than to piss them off. Now, I've had a bad experience and will tell people about it. While I love the salads there... she put me in a crappy mood and I probably won't go back. After tipping them, I should have told them to use the 2 bucks I tipped them and charge me for extra mozzarella. Customer service there is mediocre at best with just the bare minimum done.",
