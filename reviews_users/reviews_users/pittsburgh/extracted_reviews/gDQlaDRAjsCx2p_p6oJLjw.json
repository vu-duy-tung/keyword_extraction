I drive past both of the Murray Ave China Stars every day (both located across the street from a Giant Eagle, presumably just to puzzle us more) and based on the addresses have confirmed the following--  THIS CHINA STAR: -4219 Murray Ave, in Greenfield -At the old location of Yen's Gourmet -No affiliation with the China Star in the North Hills -Standard American-Chinese food  THE OTHER CHINA STAR (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/china-star-pittsburgh-3\">yelp.com/biz/china-star-...</a>): -1900 Murray Ave, in Squirrel Hill -At the old location of Pacific Ring -Affiliated with the China Star in the North Hills -Traditional Chinese food  So, there you have it. A guide to the China Stars of Murray Avenue. I, personally, have only ordered from this China Star and cannot comment on the other.  For Chinese takeout--and I mean cheap, greasy, fried \"Chinese\" food--China Star is awesome. I mean, yeah, every Chinese takeout place with the infamous red menu is pretty much the same, and I feel stupid even writing a review of one on Yelp. But I get a craving for General Tso's Chicken, Pork Lo Mein, Cold Sesame Noodles, and Fried Dumplings about once a month, and now having tried several of Pittsburgh's Chinese options based on price and convenience, I gotta say China Star is my number one choice. Everything just tastes GOOD. I totally can't justify giving a Chinese restaurant more than 3 stars, but next time you feel the need to pig out on greasy takeout food, I'd highly recommend China Star.",

This is cheap, neighborhood takeout at its best.  Lunches include an entree, rice, and soup or a soda, and most of them are under $5.  Most entrees are under $9 (except seafood entrees - the most expensive of which is $10.95).  The food is good and the restaurant is clean.  There is a big dining room with a cool circular doorway and the kind of typical Chinese knick-knacks you usually see, but it's fairly tastefully done.   As far as food goes, their vegetable fried rice includes more veggies than usual, and the sesame tofu is deliciously crispy.  It has 2 pieces of broccoli on the side, so you can pretend it's good for you.  The vegetable spring rolls are really tiny, but you get 2 for $1.50 so you can't really complain.  The hot & sour soup appears to have no beef - good news for vegetarians.  They also have some cool combination dinners where you get soup, a spring roll, a chicken wing, rice, an entree and a cookie for $10.50.  How this place makes any money is beyond me.  The only thing I haven't liked so far was the vegetables in yu-shang garlic sauce, but everything else has been good.  If you live in the neighborhood, definitely check out China Star.  You get a lot of bang for your buck, it's fast and it's never crowded.",

They just opened a few month ago.  This is their second restaurant, so you know they're pretty good.  Their first restaurant's on McKnight Road in McIntyre Square.  I recommend reading a few of the review for their other restaurant if you want get an idea of what they're about.   The good China Star serves authentic Sichuan style Chinese food.  You can tell they're authentic and good cause when you walk in, many of their customers are Chinese.  For those of you who like the general tso's and lo meins, not to worry cause they have all the \"fake\" Chinese food too.  Some of my favorites are their tan tan noodles, scallion pancake, shrimp in chili sauce, double cooked pork, garlic egg plant and they have hot pot!  So, if you don't know which China Star to go to, pick this one.  It's just a few minutes away and the food is much MUCH better.  I would give this restaurant a 4.5 out of 5 stars just because the serves could have been better (not to say it was bad).  I've actually tried the other China Star too.  No authentic food there, but their \"fake\" Chinese food wasn't bad...it wasn't very good either.  It's kind of funny but I think the non-authentic Chinese food from the other China Star is better.  In short, if I feel like some good old general tso's, I'd rather go somewhere else.  I would give this restaurant a 2 out of 5 stars because the food is edible but nothing special at all.",

When I had my fiance call to tell them that they sent the wrong order, they told him it was correct. I tried to eat this mess, got severely aggravated and called them again. The man on the phone stated that it was how the shrimp with lobster sauce was always made. He defended the incorrect meal that was sent to me. The dish has ALWAYS been delivered in a rectangle plastic container. What I got was the cylinder soup container. There was no \"sauce\" to be found in this container. Just a watery version of the dish I normally love. I told them what kind of customer I was, and they didn't care.

Once you learn what they do well (General Tso's chicken, the duck dishes, lo mein, teriyaki chicken, shrimp egg rolls, steamed and fried dumplings) and what they do not-so-well (won ton soup, fried rice, regular egg rolls)*, you can have a pretty consistently good experience with them.  Online ordering makes things a lot easier, the delivery folks are polite and arrive within the estimated time, and the food is pretty good.  Also, one night we ordered a little close to closing time and arrived a few minutes late to pick it up, and they were very nice about sticking around for us.    I wish I could give it a less lukewarm endorsement, but going from the Asian food of San Francisco, CA to that of Swissvale, PA has been a little bit jarring.  All in all, no major complaints; it's great to have a dependable Saturday-night-in staple for the fiance and I.   *The won ton soup and regular egg rolls are so-so, but passable; the fried rice is just abysmal.

    "text": "One star doesn't do this place justice. They deserve less.  We ordered a delivery of food for dinner. Upon opening the fried rice that we ordered we discovered that a bug had gotten into the food. It appeared to have been fried along with the rice. Needless to say we were displeased. We called them back and asked them to come pick up the food as we weren't going to eat it, and to bring back a reciept for the credit card cancellation of the order.  Half an hour later a man with a flashlight showed up at our door. We gave him the food back, as we'd packed it back in the bag. He proceeded to unpack the food on our patio and start digging through the fried rice with the flashlight to look for the bug. Then he started going through the rest of the food - on our patio. Making a mess with BBQ rib sauce... when asked to leave he started arguing with us. We had to threaten to call the police before he would leave the porch.  When we called and asked to speak to the manager, we were told that the man with the flashlight who had been on our porch WAS the manager.  Needless to say, I am never ordering from there again. Completely inappropriate behavior from them.  Zero stars if I could give it.",

I call in a delivery order, and she tells me that it's an hour for delivery. Could I pick up? Yeah, sure, whatever. I place my order, and then she calls back to say they have no duck, and that I need to pick another entree. OK... After I drive to the wrong (an bustling) China Star in Squirrel Hill, I make my way to the correct (and completely empty) China Star in Greenfield. Boy, this food sure is disgusting.   Hot and sour soup: inedible; vegetable spring rolls: stone cold, pale, and inedible; Double delight: chicken was stone cold, and the white sauce was a gloppy mess. The menu is already in the recycling, and maybe I'll try the other China Star next time.",

If you're looking for 'authentic' Sichuan cuisine (as far as this white guy knows, but my Chinese friends agree), this is your place.  Appetizer:  Tan tan noodles.  Best in Pittsburgh, and head and shoulders over New How Lee.  The noodles were just right, the sauce had a kick, we could have eaten bowl after bowl.  Entrees:  Double cooked sauteed sliced pork belly with leeks -- very good.  Could have used a bit more oil and the portion wasn't overly generous, but we'll get it again.  Chonqing (dry fried) chicken was the best I've had in Pittsburgh.  Where How Lee's was covered in oil, China Star's was spot on.    That's all I've tried so far, hopefully the review will be updated soon with more.    THAT SAID...The prices do seem higher (?) than the McIntyre Square location, and you do need to deal with the Squirrel Hill parking scene.  We were also there on a Sunday afternoon, so I can't speak to how the service is when they're busy.  For us, it was perfectly fine.",

Asked for drinks three times, never got them.  Got up and asked for them, cashier actually pointed to the fridge behind the counter so I had to get them myself.  Food came out....ew.  Chicken and vegetables..the chicken looked like some sort of gelatin. Fried rice was a huge softball sized clump of cold, crunchy rice. Then, as I was poking at my food looking for any reason not to eat it...I found it:   a nice, loooong, wiry strand of black hair wrapped around my veggies and staring at me like a water moccasin.    The gentleman REFUSED to take the entree off of my check.  Then, he refused to give us the check altogether until I ordered something else to replace my chicken entree.  FAT CHANCE, DUDE.  I actually had to throw a ten on a table, grab my stuff, and get the hell outta there, never to look back.  Please, stay far, far away from this place.  I  am surprised we haven't gotten sick yet!  (Not to mention the delivery guy that was sitting on the hood of my car out front of the restaurant).  Yea...not good.  Not good at all.",

I think it is supposed to be duck sauce, but it has a sweet cherry-like flavor to it. It makes the sky open and the heavens sing.  Everything else is mediocre, really. Unfortunately, the specials seem to be hit or miss. Chow mein and egg foo young is meh, but the dragon special and general tso's is okay and good portioned.   I have never eaten inside the restaurant. The smell is slightly off-putting and I am usually in the mood for take-out. The decor is stereotypical Pan-Asian food joint.  Most people go here out of convenience and that the price is good. If you  can bare the hill walk up to Zaw's, I'd go there for my meal and pick up my crab rangoon on the way back.",

My most recent order I found bone chips/gristle or something white and unchewable in my dumplings. I dissected the remaining dumplings and found it in 3 of them. I want to point out that this is the SECOND TIME I've had this happen. The first time it was in my very last dumpling and I thought it was a one time thing.   Overall the food tastes average with an above average amount of grease. I've had a few different things and saucy dishes like sesame chicken are sticky, and their beef has a very soft chewy texture. I no longer trust this restaurant and question what kind of shortcuts they must be taking to \"consistently\" (for lack of a better word) end up with crud in their dumplings.",

    "text": "My first review and it's bad. God, I didn't think it was possible to mess Chinese food up but I was in fact wrong. I ordered off Grubhub & they were an hour late. I get the bag and my buffalo sauce is dripping on my egg roll and near my general tsos. Also, the wonton soup is starting to leak as well. I ignore it and decide to dig in. The wonton soup was meh - noodles were skimpy. The egg roll was ok but I felt like they used shrimps you buy at Walmart. The wings were ok if you wanna ignore they weren't spicy at all & the meat was dark.   I now open my general tsos hoping it's good. WRONG. There were 7 pieces of chicken floating in sauce but the sauce had absolutely no taste to it. It wasn't hot or spicy - just bland. The fried rice was the only redeeming part of the meal. I have never thrown away General tsos but today, I did.  Never ordering from here again. 0/5.",

I really only go here when I want Black Pepper chicken and Crab Cheese Wontons.  It is one of the best of these that I have ever tasted.  The prices are decent and the service ok.  I've only had takeout though.  I guess if you're looking for takeout in the Greenfield/Squirrel Hill area, give them a try.",

    "text": "As others described this place, standard and reliable.  Ordered with coworkers for dinner tonight and was satisfied and underwhelmed all in one, if that's possible.    For the satisfied part, I was surprised by the amount of food I received.  I order the General Tso's (old reliable) combination plate.  Unlike other places when you order and combo plate you get soup and an egg roll on top of the entree.  To me, soup from a Chinese restaurant is nothing more than a tea with food in it.  The egg roll was surprisingly good.  I think they may have mistakenly gave me a shrimp egg roll instead of the run of the mill regular egg roll (not complaining there).  As for the entree, their \"small portion\" was that of any other place; read - not small.  As for the underwhelming aspect of the food, the fried rice may have been fried a bit too much.  Some of the chicken pieces were a bit dry.  For being General Tso's, it wasn't nearly spicy enough for me.    In a pinch, this place sure can fill the void when you are in a rush.",
