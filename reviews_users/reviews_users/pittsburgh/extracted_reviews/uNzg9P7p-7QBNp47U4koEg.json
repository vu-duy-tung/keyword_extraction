It was so great, that we actually went there twice during our 4-day vacation to catch the Steelers/Ravens game.   They have daily sandwich specials. On Thursday night we went and had the special roast beef and cheese sand., and the .35 cent wings. Very, very tasty. I'm sorry, but this place kicks Primanti Bros. butt on the taste factor. They have about 8 different types of wings... reg., garlic, and I can't remember the rest - we got the regular, and I was wishing we would had ordered more.  Going back on a Friday night, we ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and a pepperoni n' mushroom.  Wow! That buffalo chicken pizza was awesome.  The other thing that stuck out for me was one of the customers. An older gentleman; he seemed to be a regular. I really, really wanted his SPAM t-shirt.",

It was a bit on the noisy side, but the good kind of noisy.  Of course the TV's were all on the sports channel, which no one was really watching at the time.  A good place that gets 4 stars mostly because of the atmosphere and because we liked it.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, but it is the inside that counts.",

    "text": "A great townie bar with tasty food and an interesting clientele. I went to check this place out on the way home from the airport one Friday night and it didn't disappoint. It is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stops and everyone in the place is staring at you - I'm guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fans, young men in collared shirts, and thirtysomethings have probably seen it all during their time at this place.   The staff was top notch - the orders were somewhat overwhelming as they appeared short-staffed for the night, but my waitress tried to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit. The other waiter was wearing a hooded cardigan, and I wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothing.  We ordered a white pizza - large in size, engulfed in cheese, full of garlic flavor, flavorful hot sausage. An overall delicious pizza, aside from 2 things: 1, way too much grease (I know this comes with the territory, but still, it is sometimes unbearable); 2, CANNED MUSHROOMS - the worst thing to come out of a can. Ever. I would rather eat canned Alpo than canned mushrooms. And if the mushrooms weren't canned, they were just the worst mushrooms I've ever consumed. The mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star - disgusting!  My advice for the place is keep everything awesome - random music from the jukebox, tasty food, great prices, good crowd and staff - and get some decent mushrooms; why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap, I'll never know.",

All of the union guys from the ice cream factory went in there after work, and I immediately found out why.  MANY, MANY years later, I stopped in there with some fond memories, and once again felt welcomed and valued as a customer, even though they didn't know who I was.  THE SANDWICHES are done Pittsburgh-style, sort of like Primanti's, and they are as perfect today as they were back in ancient times when I first started visiting the place.  Alexion's is a clean and peaceful little place in the Rook Station part of Green Tree, the oldest part of the town.  I recall that some of the sandwiches I got there were ordered at a pretty late hour.  Nothing but good things to say about the place, and I wish it was closer to home!",

Everything was perfect (except for the celery that came with the wings - not sure what was going on there).   The decor is classic Pittsburgh, but the bathrooms were small (unless there were more located in the back room that I did not see). I think it would be a nice place to watch the game.

I had to leave and hope I made it home in time before anything left my body........  laid down the rest of the night in a ball in excruciating pain. Work up the next morning an felt fine. What ever it was - was unlike anything I have ever experienced before.  This has never happened to me in any other establishment or ever before.

I've relied on Yelp in over a dozen different cities, never came away with anything less than a positive experience until today.   We ordered within 5 minutes of sitting down, there couldn't have been more than 20 people in the place, counting the people on the patio.  Took them almost 40 minutes to serve 3 sandwiches and a salad. I tried the fish sandwich, came out fried extra crispy on the ends, if there is such a thing as fish jerky a third of the sandwich would have qualified, it was just ok. I've had better at almost any church that fries fish during Lent.   All 3 of my dinner companions left partial sandwiches  or salad uneaten. Bread french fries and onion rings were good though. Iced tea was good, though I've never seen a place dispense sweet n low like they were giving away their last rock of crack. Asked for sugar but never saw any, they don't carry any other artificial sweeteners besides the pink stuff.  I may give the place another try in the future for a Reuben or hamburger, assuming today was some aberration possibly due to a cook having a family emergency or something like that. Waitress was pretty good, held up under my multiple requests to find out if they caught my fish yet, hardly ever rolled her eyes :)",

I consider the pepperoni roll here to be the best in Pittsburgh! I'm a big fan of the buffalo chicken sandwich too, very simple, but yummy. Another great thing about this bar is for most drinks you aren't paying Pittsburgh prices. Things are very reasonable as far as drinks go. I'm not a fan of beer, but if you are. They have 20 beers on tap including ipa's, ales, Stouts/porters & as well as others. UPDATE: They feature a happy hour Monday through Friday from 5 to 7 and even on Saturday from 8 till 10! Plus daily food specials. Just a heads up the kitchen is now open 7 days a week usually opening at 11 a.m. they close at 10 p.m. Monday through Thursday, midnight Friday and Saturday, and 11 p.m. on Sunday. If you're looking for a great place to stop and there's tons of hotels around here, within walking distance or cheap Uber distance, this is a great place to go!   Enjoy  Dig",

We decided to give it a try and were pleasantly surprised.  The first thing I noticed was how clean it was inside.  We were shown to a table right beside the bar, where there were a few patrons were enjoying their drinks, albeit a little too much.  Had the pizza, wings, and cheese steak with mushrooms.  The food was really good, all but the canned mushrooms on the cheese steak.  Would have preferred fresh mushrooms, but the fresh italian roll made up for it.  More than willing to try Alexion's again.",

I pulled, out of my mouth, as much as I chewed and swallowed.  Our waitress didn't have time to hear us:  She was good; but, barely had time to deliver our check, let alone hear about the crappy, tasteless salad or the chewy, tough Rachel.

They have a nice outdoor seating section, but it was closed due to the weather.    I opted for their Friday special a fish sandwich with cheese, hold the cheese.  I hate cheese on fish, in my mind it doesn't go well together.  It came with one side and chips.  I opted for cole slaw because that does go great with fish.  The chips were straight out of a bag.  I am not a chip fan, especially not one that Lay's delivered.  It would have been nice to have homemade chips.  The special was 10.50, so I was hoping it would be good.  The wait wasn't terrible for as busy as they were, but if you're on a strict time schedule for lunch I'd call ahead.  The food arrived in about 20 minutes.  My fish sandwich though nice size was a little small for the price, compared to other's that are cheaper.  The slaw was nice, good flavor but the fish was average.  I loaded it up with some tarter and cocktail sauce to help the flavor out.  It wasn't a bad sandwich just a tad small and mediocre for the price.  I would stop back to try something else another time and would love to grab a beer here, as they had a really decent selection, and the servers were also pleasant.",

I don't want to define it as a dive bar because that wouldn't fit, it's simply a neighborhood bar/restaurant that hasn't had a hipster remodel.  And it doesn't need one!  Great food--flavorful, fresh, and at affordable prices.  I came here on a Wednesday when it was $1 off craft beers and personal \"bar\" pizzas (could easily feed two) were $4.75, both great deals.  All in all I was able to drink and eat for around $20, you can't beat it.  Also, fast and attentive service.  Parking is a breeze with two gravel lots on each side of the building.  Without a doubt will return again.   Side note, the bar is non smoking but smokers will are able to smoke on the patio.",

Happy to find a new place to add to our list... we will definitely be back.  Oh and service was excellent... which is a deal breaker for me!",

Go there with friends because the place has a lovely patio area (covered porch) and we can sit & drink &  eat & chat &  actually hear each other. We usually share a pitcher  or 2 but  Alexion's does offer a very, very good selection of craft  & other bottled beers.   Food: always tastes fresh & is well prepared. Pizza good, their wings are generally unusually large (very good garlic parm!) &  all the other offerings always good.  Sandwiches & salads- large & tasty especially for the price! Another  big plus is easy, ample, off street parking.                      **Best is the excellent service! A super friendly &  good staff!** Honestly, is just a good local bar. It is not family oriented. It's a bar for adults...leave the kids with a sitter!   It's  just a very good local joint, very Pittsburgh in spirit & service.",

THE WINGS. I consider myself an avid buffalo wing fanatic. This place had some of the best original buffalo wings I have ever tasted. They were perfect size and cooked to PERFECTION.  We also got the pepperoni rolls and pretzels. Both were delicious.  Overall, if you are a wing fan and in the area of this beautiful city, I suggest you stop by.",

After a ,ong day of moving our daughter in to her new college apartment, we needed a quick and casual dinner someplace near our hotel. I scoured Yelp for recommendations and this spot popped to the top of the list.  We sat at a booth table in the bar area and settled in with our beer and cider orders. Server was a nice kid and he took good care of us along with others from the staff who chipped in as needed. The vibe there is very \"local\" where the servers seemed to know everyone who came through the door (except us! ha!) and folks appeared to be having a good time.  On to the meal review, however. We ordered a house salad, a burger to share and an order of wings. The salad was chopped lettuce, carrots and cabbage and was clearly from a bag. Nothing special to say the least. Our standard cheeseburger was most likely frozen and thrown on a grill given its shape and how it was cooked, but it was served atop a terrible, chewy bun straight out of a bag. The saving grace to the meal were the buffalo garlic parmesan wings, which we found pretty decent with a mild tangy flavor from the sauce and parm cheese combined.  Wish there was more to say about this place...although the atmosphere was chill, the food left a lot to be desired.",

They were super busy but only had one person working the bar/tables. However, she was very on top of things and worked quickly so no complaints here.    The atmosphere has a very \"local bar\" feel which I love. I ended up getting their 'wedgie' which is a sandwich made with pizza dough. It was super good. I had more of a chicken sandwich and I think opting for something with more flavor such as salami would have paired nicer with the dough. So, I am going to opt for that next time!   Great food, beer on tap, service, and price. We plan on going back soon when we just need a place to kick up and enjoy some solid food.",

    "text": "Where do I even begin:  At the moment of arrival, the outside of the establishment looked like a building in foreclosure, as it was dim and insipid.  As I entered the building, the restaurant was pumping loud rock music from every corner of the building, which obviously made it hard to communicate with the waiters(but I'll get there in a moment).  A group of close friends and I sat on the couch seats, which seemed old fashioned and a little outdated. To my surprise, the place was PACKED with people.  Our waitress(who seemed to be the only one as she was running around the whole building checking on the customers), finally approached our table and asked what we would like to order. One of my partners asked for a salad and the other asked for the chicken tenders, while I ordered the smokehouse burger.  I knew there should have been suspicion about the food, since the waitress had a difficult time describing the salad to my partner, having only said \"it's like what's in a regular salad\" and recited a list of what is suppose to be in a salad, such as lettuce, dressing, and to my partners surprise, pickles.  A solid 30-45 minutes had passed and the food had finally came, well, to everybody accept my order. As my partners were experiencing in on the salad and the chicken, I waited another 3 minutes for my smokehouse burger to arrive. And I was SHOCKED.  What my eyes detected first was the use of white toast bread( uncooked and not even toasted), When I expected the traditional brown buns to appear. The smokehouse burger consisted of onion rings, teriyaki sauce, bacon, and cheese, which luckily it had all the components.   The burger was too big to put in a human-sized mouth. I have made a couple of attempts to eat the sand which like a burger, however the size of the burger was overpowering. I asked my waitress for a fork and knife to help dissect this behemoth.   As fast as I had put the food in my mouth was the same speed I wanted to spit out the bite. First. The teriyaki sauce was inconsistent with the burger, as there were large patches of the sauce in some areas of the burger while the others were scarce. The onion ring was probably made with poorly made batter and the crust couldn't hold on to the onion itself. The bacon, however, was crisp and it is what you would expect from bacon, light, tasty, crunchy.   Now here's the real disappointment. The party itself was BLAND. Absolutely no seasoning in it, not even salt and pepper. The cook of the burger was well done and I couldn't take another bite from that sandwich.   Aside from my plate, my partner had tasted the table ketchup and she found a weird taste in it. I took a sample of the ketchup in the bottle and it tasted old and warm, which should not be a characteristic of ketchup.  And to top it all of, one of the customers sitting at the bar was arguing over the loud music to another customer and at a server. We stopped paying attention, grabbed our things and left. Never coming back.",

    "text": "I never would have found this place if it weren't for Yelp, and I'm so glad I did! After seeing everyone's picture of the wedgie's I HAD to get one.  Luckily my boyfriend and I split one, cause they are HUGE! I didn't quite know what I was getting myself into when I ordered it, but this thing is like a giant sandwich, but the bread is PIZZA CRUST! I was so pleasantly surprised when I figured that out! We tried the steak wedgie and it was soooo good! It also happened to be wing night which is Tuesdays and Thursdays.  Wings are 40 cents...super cheap and super yummy!   This place is definitely a sporty, divey, casual place to come for a drink or bite to eat, but I think that's part of its charm.  The staff was very friendly but I did have a bit of trouble getting prompt service which is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars, but hey, it could have just been an off night, and the food was worth the wait! Definitely give this place a try, you'll be happy you did!!!",

    "text": "Love love love. Perfect hometown bar atmosphere, super friendly service and yummy eats. Having two of those talked about Wedgies (though you could easily share one), side of coleslaw and 4 microbrew drafts, set us back only $44, which felt just right. We saw many baskets of wings go by, which do look baller and they have like 8-10 different sauces.   We arrived at about 6pm on a Friday and it was busy! We were able to nab the last parking spot in Alexion's small lot (maybe about 10 spots) and found one of the last few bar tables open inside, though they do have a small outdoor patio to the side by the parking lot. By the time we left about an hour and a half later, it had died down, presumably before the night time drinking crowd moves in.",

    "text": "This is a great little pub that is located in a residential neighborhood.  That just doesn't happen in NC so we were pretty intrigued by the location.  We arrived on a Tuesday evening at around 6:30.  We sat in a booth as soon as we arrived.  Our server arrived right away with menus.  She was super helpful with beer selection.  She brought us several samples so we could make a tasty choice.  For dinner , I knew that I wanted the steak salad with fries (you can't get fries in your salad in NC).  My husband had the nights special which was a steak sandwich and fries.  The food was good and the service was great.  If you are in the Greentree area be sure and stop by.  It's a great little pub.",

Was a little disappointed that we only had once choice in cooking of the burger. Some one else in the party order a reubens and it was okay.  They also need to get bigger table because four people can not sit at one table.  The French fries where really good.  Pickles where the best things.",
