It's insane!  Add in 5 bucks tip...and it's borderline ludicrous.  Come on.",

    "text": "Really good, hearty Italian fare.  Perfect if you are staying in Oakland.  Wine list was extensive, but pretty overpriced, really.  The bread was old style, crispy, garlicky, etc... The salad was wonderful - had beets, garbanzo beans, and a heavenly, light, balsamic vinegarette.  I added the crumbled bleu cheese to mine.  Yum.   My mom got the linguini with shrimp and scallops.  The scallops were perfectly cooked.  The pasta was done aldente (perfect), but the sauce needed a little extra salt.  (Maybe they cater some to the retirement community across the street?).  I had the ravioli sampler plate - home made pasta on the raviolis - OMG, good.  Could've used a little more salt as well, but the parmesean cheese at the table made up for it.  Meatball, large and tasty.  Sausage was the bomb.  The sauteed spinach (which I was really looking forward to ) lacked flavor.  Parmesean cheese added to this as well.  My dad had the lasagna sampler and was very happy with it. Overall, 4 stars for a solid meal.  I'd rather have things undersalted than over, and let me make corrections. The staff was attentive, and the decor was awesome!!!! A definite must return spot!",

    "text": "Zarra's has a special place in my heart and in my stomach. If you want honest italian fare, without a twist, without the flare and without every dish covered in provolone or mozzarella cheese, this is the place.  Once upon a time this was a punk/disco club with a storied past and if you ask Johnny Z about it he'll have more than enough stories to share with you about the first phase of this restaraunt's life.  The dining room is filled with eclectic decor from years of collecting and looks like an italian grandma's house. The menu here is extensive. Filled with old country recipies from peasant dishes like polenta to decadent rack of lamb or filet mignon. Everything is cooked to order by the chef so you have plenty of time to sit and enjoy your family or your date over drinks. Although i have visited many times the two dishes i sampled on my most recent visit were the homemade ricotta noodles and the salsa picante di jr williams. The ricotta noodles had a great texture. Unlike typical noodles these were more like ravioli without the stuffing made slightly more dense more akin to a gnocchi. I opted for sausage and meatballs and both were a great compliment to the noodles, the sauce both rich and with that great deep tomato flavor. The salsa was a tangle of peppers, garlic, mushrooms, onions covered in a spicy arrabiatta sauce over prefectly cooked spaghetti noodles. The veggies were well cooked and the sauce had a bit of a kick. The menu says \"not for the faint of heart\" and i def needed a few glasses of water and beer to wash it down. The waitstaff was good at serving drinks and keeping bread on the table even though we were seated in the back and with a handfull of other full family tables. Overall another great experience. Johnny and his family are great, the food is great, you'll never leave hungry here just like in the old country.",

From the beautiful stained glass to the plethora of swords, the wall decorations will definitely provide for interesting conversation!  Despite the kitchy decor, mismatched chairs and tablecloths,  the food was fantastic, and the service was attentive.  From the scallops to the rack of lamb, my family enjoyed everything that we ordered.  It's nice that all of the entrees come with garlic bread and a salad.  When I'm back in Pittsburgh, I'd definitely return.  My only concern: we were there on a  Saturday night, and the place was pretty empty.  I know it's a little off the beaten path, but I wonder how it's going to keep surviving....",

    "text": "Great food, great people. I would come back to Pittsburgh just to eat here.   My friend and I were driving across country and this place came highly recommended from a Pittsburgh local. We arrived close to closing, they seated us, were extremely friendly, and courteous to us. Owned by a family, you can tell this is the sort of honest family owned restaurant that is hardly seen anymore.   The food was exceptional. The cook is the owners' daughter in law, and the food is among if not the very best Italian food I've ever had. The salad course had an exceptional balsamic dressing, the lasagna was without fault. I am not a guy who usually eats lasagna, but this was out of this world.   The owner's son was bar-tending and comped us an exceptional dessert drink of his own concoction, which was a surprising blend of what I can only imagine was Kahlua and Bailey's Irish Cream.  Plus, this place had a lot of local history behind it. Originally called the \"Electric Banana Club,\" this place was a hotbed of punk rock activity in the 1980's. Even though it's now a very traditional Italian restaurant, you have to appreciate a place that has that much character and history.   We only stopped by, but you'd be hard pressed to find Italian food this good, anywhere in the country. Do yourself a favor and stop by.",

    "text": "Zarra's is on the short list of places I hit every time I visit Pittsburgh.  It's the closest thing you'll find to eating at your Italian grandmother's house.  The decor is a hodgepodge of antiques and odd artifacts that make it very homey.  The staff always includes Zarra's family members and they always remember you.  The food is fantastic.  The sausage and meatballs are made in house by Johnny, the recipes are from Judy's family and some of the dishes, like the ricotta noodles, you won't find anywhere else.  I get mean cravings for the sausage and peppers over pasta.  Your entrees will come with giant garlic bread and a salad with homemade dressing.  Unless you stop eating halfway through your meal, you'll never fit dessert, but, if you do, the sweet creations are also all made in house.  I recommend the homemade cheesecake, it's light and fluffy.  One year Judy made me a homemade cake for my birthday and it was the best cake I've ever had in my life.  Sometimes the meal takes a bit longer than you may expect but that's usually because the staff is chatting at your table but I'd rather have an overly friendly staff any day.  It's not uncommon for the owner to pull up a chair and shoot the breeze.",

    "text": "This Italian restaurant is located slightly off the beaten path off of University of Pittsburgh's campus. When you walk inside and walk past the bar, the restaurant opens up to one semi-large room with approximately 15-20 tables, with various eclectic items on the walls ranging from swords to photographs. You will be seated easily as there are rarely more than a few groups dining at Zarra's. For this reason, you might expect to be waited on fully and quickly. However, in the four times that I have been to Zarra's this has not been the case. All four times it has been approximately thirty minutes from sit down to order, followed by an hour from order to dinner, with another thirty minutes from the end of dinner to check. Although I am happy to have dinner at a relaxed pace, it seems unnecessarily long at Zarra's given the lack of patrons present.  Along with the lethargic pace of dinner, the service is performed at a sluggish attitude as well. Servers often disappear for tens of minutes at a time, leaving first time diners to wonder where they have gone. Despite the fact that there are few tables being served at once, there never seems to be a server nearby when assistance is required.   As far as the food goes, Zarra's serves classic Italian-style food. The food is a  decent value for the price, with most entrees being prices in the 20-30$ range. The pasta dishes are especially tasty with \"Judy's\" sauce making the dish regardless of which plate you choose. For this reason, the food is what makes this a place that I have come back to multiple times. If you are willing to set aside 2-3 hours for dinner, and don't mind a little quirkiness, Zarra's is worth checking out. Overall, the food is decent and the experience is something you wont likely forget; for better or for worse.",

Unclear.   Got the bill.  They charged us for blue cheese on the salads we never got.  Huh again?   Didn't correct the bill but offered us free tiaramusu which also NEVER came. Huh.

    "text": "If you just want the skinny- Delish!!!! Authentic! Genuine! A wee bit overpriced with the add ons. DO NOT let that deter you. Read on for enjoyment purposes only.  Okay- I never write posts, but I feel obligated to do so here. Let me preface by saying I am a FOODIE, I work in the restaurant industry, I live to find great places to eat, and I travel...A LOT. So today I had to drive up to Pittsburgh for work and ended up landing at the Residence Inn in Oakland, PA, because:  A. I waited to long to book at the Hampton, and B. Love the Marriot Rewards points.  Needles to say, I arrived late, tired, and a wee bit dissapointed at my lodging accomodations (the staff makes up for it in friendliness and hospitality).   None the less it is time for dinner, and of course the Front Desk is pitching this allegedly \"AMAZING\" italian restaurant (they even had a sign in the lobby)- by the way just accross the street and the ONLY restaurant on the street (and it's not the prettiest of streets mind you). Any of those reading this that travel shares my first thought of \"Danger Danger... Do not eat there!\".   But, all they had downstairs were stoffers mac n' cheese, and some chicken chinese stir fry, so I decided to spend some time not catching up on email and take a look at the Zarra's menu online. Once I started reading, the interest of the 2nd generation Italian in me was peaked.   So I gave in and gave them a call. Maybe I got lucky... I don't know, but I got the nicest coolest guy on the other end of the line. It goes like this... \"Zarras , Good Evening?\" \"Hi, what time do you close?\" \"Ahh...we're open and seating, what time do you want to eat?\" \"\"Oh I just got in and am staying at the hotel across the street and was checking.\" \"Oh yeah, come on over, we'll gett you seated\" \"Can I order something to be delivered to?\" \"Sure thing we can do that\" \"Ok great, I'll call you right back\"  I was so stoked by the non a-hole response that I normally get, where a restaurant sums me up as the 8:45 pm wishy washy annoying last minute order of the evening, that I called back 5 minutes later to order something (even though I realized at that point I wasn't hungry).  I will paraphrase this conversation for those that I have lost, am about to lose, or who are just plain annoyed by my endless diatribe (I can't help it! I dig this place!). A lady answered and asked for my order. I asked her what is good and she knew the menu and started rattling things off.  We landed on the ricotta pasta with meatballs AND sausage (I'm italian- if they say they make both from scratch- GAME ON), with a side salad w/homemade balsamic.She told me about all of the desserts they make from scratch and extra tidbits of yumminess, but for once I stuck to my guns.Ironically- this was this biggest mistake of my life. I should have ordered one of everything, charged it to my company account, called in sick the next day, and just nurtured an Italian Indulgence/hangover.  I decided to walk accross the street and pick up the food. It is a small place in between what I can only describe as row houses (hey, I'm from San Diego and live in DC- give me a break). You walk into this dimly lit but nice and clean front sitting area with a bar. They were folding napkins and closing for the night. I won't go in to detail except to say- Cool, Genuine and Quarky characters.   I wanted to sit at the bar and start chatting with everyone working there. A guy in his 30's offered to seat me right away, and then the lady who took my order came over to help me. Everyone was of course Italian and REAL! But the best- an older Gentleman dressed better than any man I've ever dated (owner?) that told me before the restaurant this place was the Electric Banana (I have not researched that yet- assuming an 80's accident in naming vs what I'm thinking). What I got from him, was that he has been the owner since the getgo. I could literally write another 5 pages about just how fun and unique the people are that run this place.  I left with my food in tow wishing I could hang out and drink with those guys. Came back to my room and started working, forgetting about my meal. SHAME ON ME! Then it hit me and I started unwrapping the 3-time foil-wrapped container (I'm already in love, because red sauce gets everywhere in the bag!).   One sniff and one bite- this is like my grandma's, like mine (because my grandma taught me). Meatballs perfect. Ricotta pasta- not what I expected, but in a good way. It's like a gnocchi, but cut like pasta, but different. I dunno- it's good! Dressing delish, like visiting Long Island family. Sausage, chunky with whole fennel seeds...ding ding ding!  I only wish I had tried more there. I ordered the ricotta pasta because many of the other items were a bit steep- my only complaint. But with the quality tasted thus far, I can imagine it is well worth it!  Note to self- should I stay at the Residence Inn from now on, just so I can eat here? TO BE CONTINUED...",

    "text": "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! We were looking for a place to eat that was still open late at night, near our hotel, Residence Inn (off of Bigelow). Looked online and several sites suggested Zarra's. Called the restaurant, they just closed for the evening, but they asked how many were in our party, and if we could get there quickly, they would stay open for us. We arrived a few minutes later, and had the whole restaurant to ourselves. They seated us at a table they usually deserve for family. My 4 month granddaughter was a little fussy (traveled by plane from the west coast, to NYC, then long car ride). The chef already left for the evening, so mama (owner of the restaurant) did the cooking. Her son Donnie, and a waiter (sorry! Forgot his name.) seated us, waited on us, and served us. They made us feel like family. They even held Malia (whose fussiness finally subsided). The dinner, dessert, wine, and after dinner drink was absolutely DELICIOUS!! Salad was yummy with anchovies. Rack of lamb was succulent, filet mignon tender, perfectly cooked, and juicy. Manicotti to die for, accompanied by a suggested Italian red wine. Dessert ~ heavenly! My husband and son-in-law loved every bite of their cannoli. My daughter and I agreed that the tiramisu was the best we EVER had. Layered, light, and absolutely tasty at every bite. Not too sweet, not too rich. Zarra's family-owned restaurant was among the highlights of our first trip to Pittsburg, PA to attend our nephew's wedding. Can't say enough of this place!! Great food, service, & family-style ambience!!  ~ Warmest regards,  The Reidy & the Halsey families Vancouver, Washington",

I only had a Cannoli and bite of Tiramisu, but it was leaps and bounds more authentic than my earlier Shrimp Scampi. My Caffe de Carol ( Coffee with liqueur) was pretty awesome too.  Everything here is homemade fresh, so I'm sure the food is legit. Sadly the service leaves a lot to be desired. I had to leave the table and ask for my waiter twice. Nevertheless, if you are staying at the Residence Inn in Oakland cross the street and try this place.",

    "text": "I came here with my parents this past Fri. evening at around 6pm.  I live a few blocks away and Zarra's was one of the closest places I had bookmarked.  Given that my mom is a picky eater and enjoys casual Italian eateries, and that my parents were staying in Oakland (not at the hotel across the street, FWIW), I figured it was as good of a reason as any to check it out. Zarra's is most definitely an old school red sauce joint, so it fits the bill for Pittsburgh Italian comfort food--don't come here if you're expecting trendy, cutting-edge fare.  For our entrees, my mom had the meatless lasagna ($16), my dad has the Zarra's sampler ($22), and I had the ricotta noodles ($18).  All of the entrees came with side salads, as well as a shared bread plate.  The bread was insubstantial and mediocre, and came with an oil dipping sauce, which is a good thing, since it wouldn't have held up to butter.  The salads were along the same lines, consisting of spinach dressed with a vinaigrette sauce and a few vegetables that most likely came out of a can.  You can get blue cheese on your salad, which my mom and I did, or anchovies, as my dad did, but just be aware that these additions come at an upcharge.  Fortunately, the entrees were better.  The manicotti had an interesting pointy shape and light texture that was different than any I've eaten before.  Flavorwise, they weren't too exciting, which was also True for the red sauce.  Each entree came with a side of sausage, meatball, or eggplant, so I chose the latter for mine since I'm inherently leery of ground meat.  The eggplant added some variety to the dish, but I found it a bit on the mushy side.  My mom and dad enjoyed their entrees--my mom is picky about the composition of lasagna, so I was happy to see that she ate it without picking it apart.  I tried a bite of it, and it was pretty similar to the lasagna she makes at home, which is probably why.  I didn't try any of the other items, so I can't directly comment on them except to say that the meatballs are huge (about 3\" in diameter and twice the size of meatballs I've had at the meatball joint downtown).  I wanted to try the baked Alaska since I'd never had one, but my parents were too full to share it with me, and I didn't want to get stuck eating the whole thing, so we ended up passing on it.  Overall, we were generally satisfied with our meal at Zarra's, despite the lackluster start to the meal.  The fare was exactly what I expected, satisfying my mom's pickiness and filling us all up after a long day of travel or work.  The service was excellent, as was proper given that we were about the only ones in the restaurant other than a few people sitting on the porch by the time we left.  As others have mentioned, the decor--right down to the toilet seat in the women's restroom--is interesting and eclectic, and makes for good conversation.  While I probably wouldn't go out of my way to return, I wouldn't be opposed to coming back sometime--perhaps to try the baked Alaska--given its convenience to my apt.  3.5 stars.",

We ordered some cocktails from the bar first and the bartender/server proceeded to literally scream at the tv about how trump was going to fix the economy. He managed to ruin my Moscow mule by pouring it in a glass and clumsily dumped it into the copper cup afterward. It took them nearly thirty minutes to give us bread that wasn't fresh or even toasted. Apps were atrocious, four measly stuffed mushrooms that were mushy and bland and \"fresh\" calamari that was drowning in balsamic vinegar. House salad was also doused in so much balsamic it was impossible to eat. Food took way too long to come out, I got the linguini: bland and swimming in butter, the (single) scallop wasn't seared and tasted like tofu. My friend got spaghetti and meatballs and it was literally just unseasoned Ragu dumped on a handful of noodles and a single over cooked meatball. Also throughout the night a ten year old Boy Scout was serving us water? A truly baffling experience; this place is a swindle.",

The dinner salad and Italian bread were excellent too!  The interior is unquestionably unique and eclectic.

This is a family run business - and the servers are wonderfully friendly and the food is fresh and delicious and if you are lucky enough to be there on a day that Judy is in the kitchen you are in for a real treat.  The food is always good, but you can always tell when it's made by Judy's expert hands.  I've been here many times and will definitely be back again and again.  Probably my favorite thing on the menu is the Ricotta Dumpling Soup.  It is one of the best soups that I've ever had in my life!  I've sometimes gone there just to get soup and salad because the soup is that delicious.  I've tried many of their entrees, but one of my favorites is the simple Algie i Olio which I sometimes add the Italian tuna to the dish to make it even more mouthwatering and delicious.  Judy's Ricotta Noodles are warm, pillowy delights topped with the rich tomato sauce - absolutely delicious!  The Melenzane Romano is another one of my favorite dishes.  There are so many great things on the menu and even though I've dined at Zarra's many times, I still haven't tried even half the menu because I keep going back to my favorites time and again.  Great Italian food!",

It also came with a bowl of pasta and marinara sauce.  I want going to eat the pasta...but it only took one bite for me to realize how awesome it was. Yum. Others had the Fettuccini Alfredo.

We've been talking about trying Zarra's for awhile and tonight we finally did.   First - the decor: It is so quirky. We loved it. There are a variety of weapons and... old toys... and stuffed ducks and such a mismash of things in the dining room. We spent part of the meal discussing which of the swords, daggers, crossbow we would bring to a duel with each other.   Second - the food: It was good. It was really good. I had the alfredo and it was creamy and seasoned and the pasta was al dente. My boyfriend had the ricotta pasta with a meatball and the meatball was giant, the pasta fluffy and unique and delicious. He says the tomato sauce was also delicious. I don't know because I don't like tomatoes, but I believe him. Our meals came with garlic bread and salads and the lettuce was crunchy and fresh. My only criticism of the food is that the salads were maybe a wee bit overdressed, though we liked the balsamic dressing.   The waitress was friendly and it seemed like a family-run operation.   We'll go back.",

    "text": "I went here for my birthday with the SO. We sat in the patio area, which is really nice. There's cute lighting out there and a big iron stove that wasn't lit while were there, but looks awesome sitting in the corner. The inside of the restaurant is also something to see. Unfortunately, it's not a good enough reason to come check this place out and I can't offer you another.  For starters, we asked our server about one of the wines and her answer was simply that she didn't know. There was no offer to ask someone else nor any effort to find the answer, just she didn't know. Not a big deal, we decided to just risk it on the wine, but not the best way to start dinner.   We ordered the Manicotti di Antoinette and the Melenzane Romano. They both came with dinner salads and bread. The lettuce in the salad was all romaine and it was crunchy and fresh. Everything else in the salad came from a can, maybe a jar, I don't know, but the freshness ended with the lettuce. The salad was topped with chickpeas, beets, olives, and a couple slivers of roasted pepper. The dressing was homemade, but nothing special, a very basic vinaigrette. The bread was so utterly disappointing I'm not sure where to start. The bread was served in a basket wrapped with a towel, but it wasn't warm. It was dry and bland. It wasn't served with butter, which is good because even room temperature butter would have ripped right through this stuff.   Service was already completely lacking at this point. We waited 15 or 20 minutes for our salads, which wasn't so bad, we had wine after all. We didn't see our server much during that time, but we did see her again shortly after we got our salads because she had our entrees. Fine dining at its worst! Timing is important, but nobody at Zarra's seems to care.  The entrees were underwhelming as well. I ordered the Melenzane Romano, which is described as \"Fresh eggplant lightly battered and browned in olive oil, layered with marinara sauce and grated romano cheese; then baked to perfection. Includes sauteed mushrooms and sauteed spinach. $18\". The eggplant was really good and their marinara is great. The mushrooms and spinach on the plate were so, so, sooooooo disappointing. The mushrooms were boring and the spinach was just a blob of tasteless right-from-the-freezer ickiness. The SO ordered the Manicotti di Antoinette \"Another house favorite. Each homemade crepe is individually prepared and filled with Judy's special ricotta filling, then topped with tomato sauce, a sprinkle of grated romano and baked in the oven. Served with your choice of meatball, sausage, or eggplant romano. $18\". Again, great marinara & the eggplant he ordered with it was good stuff. Not bad, but not worth the price, not even close.  Since we still had some wine, and it was my birthday, we decided to stay for dessert. Turns out, we shouldn't have bothered. We ordered the Tirami-Suzy. It's good that they don't actually call it tiramisu since it's made with cream cheese and not mascarpone. And, ordering dessert added about 45 minutes to the whole experience. Their version of tiramisu is heavier than it should be and not good. It's just wrong. That kinda sums up everything about this place, it's just wrong. The service was bad (we ended up getting up and going inside to pay our bill), not much that we were served seemed fresh, and their prices are ridiculous for what they serve and how they serve it. They get two stars because the place is actually pretty cute. Lucky for you, it's not the only cute place in Pittsburgh.",

You get about 5 or 6 ricotta noodles. I could've eaten twice that. Sausage was very good though. As for the manicotti, one manicotti is not really a meal.  The meatball is great, however. The sauce is on the sweet side. Dessert was tiramisu ($9) and one espresso ($4.75). Both were very good. But in my opinion $58 plus tax and tip for two people for average food (and small portions) is too much.",

    "text": "Really satisfying, classic Italian food. I am not of Italian descent, so I can't speak from any experience of \"authentic\" home-style Italian food, but the food I had at Zarra's was close to what I would imagine simple, tasty home-style Italian to be.  The salads that came with the entrees were tasty, and were definitely a little step up from the usual sad house iceberg salad I'd expect to be included with a meal. The bread and dipping oil that came before the meal were delicious. I was in the mood for something simple and home-y, so I ordered the the Ricotta Noodles with sausage, while my boyfriend had the lasagna with sausage. Neither dish was mind-blowing, but they were tasty, satisfying, and comforting.  This is not super fancy gourmet food, which is fine, since I don't want (/can't afford...) that all the time, but Zarra's is very good for what it is. A word of caution- be aware of the prices before you go! Zarra's is definitely at the upper end of that \"$$\" range for Yelp... Our meal of just two pasta dishes (seriously: no appetizers, only waters to drink, nothing with seafood, etc...) came out to about $30 per person after including tip, which was a little more than we were expecting to pay for a casual, mid-week \"it's-late-and-we-don't-feel-like-cooking\" dinner out. This is definitely my fault for not looking more closely at the menu pictures on Yelp (the menu on the website does not have prices). I will definitely return, but next time I'll be mentally prepared to get some wine and appetizers to make it a True date night!",

When we entered the decor was a little overwhelming at first, but after a while we enjoyed pointing out new and interesting things hidden throughout the restaurant. Overall the dining area is large yet cozy.  There were six of us but no one was starving so we got two orders of the stuffed banana peppers and three orders of the Zarra's sampler to share. The samplers were entrees so each one came with a salad which we also shared, and the table had fresh bread with olive oil, garlic, cheese, and red pepper flakes for everyone. Everything was delicious. The eggplant and sauteed spinach were my favorite. The lasagna had so much cheese, it was amazing. We walked out of there with full bellies and had basically licked the plates clean.  Our waitress was very attentive and helpful. At one point the owner or owners son (not sure which), stopped by the table to say hi and make sure we were enjoying ourselves. Overall, it was a very good experience.",

    "text": "Really disappointed with my experience here!  (Skip to the ~~~~***below to get to the real juicy stuff)  First of all, My friend and I were excited to go out for a \"girl's night\" and have some nice food in a place slightly off the beaten path. We're both young ladies, but immediately upon entering were treated by the manager as though we were children. He also didn't seem to respect his wait staff. He yelled to the back, \"THE GIRLS WILL GET YOU SOON\", to prompt their attention so someone would come seat us. This didn't seem like a respectful way to speak to his employees, and especially not in front of customers. So that was an unpleasant start.  Our waitress was a nice and friendly lady. Immediately upon sitting down I asked if I was able to use my <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupons. I had two \"buy $20 get $10 off\" coupons. I figured there might be a rule against using two coupons at one table, but the waitress told me it was no problem, so my friends and me felt excited to order whatever we wanted.  For two young people the meals aren't cheap, about $25 per entree.  When the meals came, we were surprised to see how much they  charged for how little they provided. The ricotta noodle entree came sparsely plated with only five small-sized dumplings and a big meatball. I don't know how they can ration selling that for over $20? Certainly not worth it on the purchaser's end.  I mean, the food was fine, it wasn't earth-shattering. The lasagna on the sampler platter was definitely the best part. Everything else was pretty average. The tomato sauce was sugary sweet. It was nice to have hot food on a cold night, but the flavor of the food itself wasn't anything original or special.  At one point I was in the bathroom near the kitchen and cash register area, and heard workers yelling complaints at each other through the door. Again, not a pleasant customer experience.  ~~~~***The biggest problem came when my friend and I wanted to pay and leave. Firstly, it took a long time for the check to arrive.  Our nice server finally came, and I handed her my coupons. At that moment the manager walked over, and the server, who after we had ordered told us this was only her second day and her second job, ask him how to apply the coupons. The manager, who treated us demeaningly on the way in, roared back \"WHAT COUPONS?\" He proceeded to tell us that Zarra's doesn't take <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupons anymore, and that they haven't for a long time.  Now, I know <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a>. I love them and will stick by them. If restaurants no longer want to utilize their services, <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> will send out a notification to whoever bought their coupons and will refund them, no questions asked.  This did not happen to me for Zarra's.  He told me, trying to make himself out to sound benevolent and as though this would seriously strain him, that he \"would honor one coupon tonight\". I told him that our waitress told us that we would be able to use both coupons. He boomed back at me, challengingly, \"WHO TOLD YOU THAT?!\" I didn't want our waitress, who was so kind and working another job apart from this one, to get in trouble, so I told him it wasn't important. He told me that \"if it's the new girl, she doesn't know anything\".  Well, isn't that your job as a manager to teach her? I'm not sure you're completing your duties to the fullest extent either, then.  I pulled out my phone and showed him how Zarra's was still listed on the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> website. He told me that it must have been a mistake, that he cancelled it, etc. etc. etc.  Throughout this entire exchange he made his demeanor very intimidating. He's a large, bald, loud man, and we're two small young ladies. It was obvious he was trying to use the power dynamic here to overpower us. My friend admitted afterward that he made her feel very scared. Should customers really leave a restaurant, a place they go to spend their own money for leisure, feeling shaken up and uncomfortable?  I didn't feel scared per say-- what was he going to do, fight someone a third of his weight?-- but he definitely was not acting level-headedly or rationally. I would have been more assertive, perhaps refused to pay what I wasn't expecting to pay throughout my long dinner, if I weren't concerned that the new waitress would get in trouble.  Ultimately, us paying $10 more is not worth her losing her job. I just hope she doesn't find working there to be as unbearable an experience as it seems to be, since clearly management has little respect for its employees and its customers.  ~~~~***In the end I left feeling disrespected, dissatisfied, angry at my mistreatment, and just scammed.  I would not go back and I don't recommend you try going there.  If you want better service and food there is a McDonald's on Forbes down the road a ways that I guarantee is a better option.  Hopefully this review is a lesson to Zarra's to treat their customers better, and not to mess with small girls with laptops~",

Three of us chose the Linguine di Contosta (linguine with mussels, shrimp and scallops) but each prepared in a different sauce - all delicious.  Flavorful and not overpowered with garlic or salt like some places.  My other friend had ricotta and homemade sausage - he liked it so much that he was on his last bite before he thought to ask if I wanted to try it. (I found out why).  The salads are served with a house balsamic dressing and had a lot more than just the basics.  If you come, absolutely save room for the tiramisu!  We had two waitresses who worked in tandem. Pleasant, knowledge about the menu, and attentive throughout our entire evening, they were on top of everything.  The decor is definitely unique. From interesting (old diving helmet) to pretty (paintings) to cool (various swords), there is everything and anything.  I will definitely return and recommend Zarra's to others.

    "text": "In a nutshell: eclectic decor, yet intimate. Overpriced. Smells like your grandma's perfume.   I didn't have a great experience here. I usually don't mind weird decor but some of the stuff they have here are just plain creepy. It's weird to catch a mannequin or doll staring at you in the corner of your eye when you're eating. Just saying. The dining room was cluttered and the smell is overwhelming of talc powder. The smell was so strong, it kind of made me sick. So I was really hoping the food would be amazing. The menu looks impressive because it doesn't look like your average Italian menu and it has a lot of homemade items. I ordered Judy's Homemade Ricotta Noodles and it was good, but certainly not life-changing. The sauce was on the sweet side and although it was good, it could not balance the overwhelming flavor of black pepper from the noodles. The black pepper turned the dish incredibly spicy. I don't know if I can quite call these noodles either. They're more like huge chunks of pasta dough, about 3/4 inch thick pieces cut into 1 in. by 3 in. pieces. All dishes come with a mixed green salad, not your typical iceberg lettuce salad most other Italian restaurants give. The service could also have been better. Our waiter did not smile once and he spoke to us with such a condescending tone, despite us giving him no trouble at all. With food not all that special, steep prices, rude service and creepy decor, I don't think I'll be back.",

    "text": "If you are looking for an Italian place that resembles a small family run restaurant this place has all the looks of it from the unique decor and pink building. However, the family itself leave a lot to be desired. The mother is the main cook and I will say she usually does a fairly good job. The son Donnie is a complete waste of space for this restaurant. He claims to be a waiter, but it's hard to be a waiter when you are sitting at the bar or watching tv or on his phone outside.   I can't even get started on the father. He is clearly the owner and mastermind and financial guy for this restaurant. Unfortunately, if you googled the definition of obnoxious, ignorant Italian man it wouldn't even come close to explaining the efforts this man goes through to be and sound like an ass. He routinely screams/tells (talks?) at his staff and even customers. Sorry Zarra's but you'd be better off without him. He literally does nothing for the restaurant except hang out and yell at people.  The only thing this family has going for them is the rest of the staff who haven't quit yet. I'm only giving them 1 star because giving 0 wasn't an option.   I mean...who washes silverware in Windex? Gross! Ammonia on my utensils? No thanks! I'll never go back",

We were greeted by the owner, Donny and the waitress, Emily and seated comfortably. Immediately the eclectic decor of the room jumps out at you. We started by splitting the stuffed mushrooms, which were excellent, and the ricotta dumpling soup which was absolutely delicious (think Italian matzo ball soup). For the main course, I enjoyed the cavatelli di anna, with tender homemade pasta and shrimp and scallop. The rest of my party had the filet mignon (perfect) and Filomena's homemade ravioli which were also completely on point.   Despite it being only her second day, our server Emily did an incredible job, and showed a solid knowledge of the menu items despite her brief time working there. We were also treated with the presence of Donny's young son, Donato who was an absolute gentleman and very entertaining.  Keep up the good work, Donny. Five stars isn't enough.",

Stuffed banana peppers were something unique as an appetizer. Not earth shattering, but solid nontheless. The ricotta noodles were good. The ravioli was actually very good. The sausage was better than the meatball, but both were definitely above average. The ambiance was quirky and weird. Service was friendly enough, but definitely slow.

A good fresh salad - variety not just plain old iceberg you find passing as salad - and the balsamic was good.  Great homemade bread and even freshly grated parmesan to die for!   The housemade sausage and meatball was a great addition to Judy's Ricotta Noodles - think big gnocci like pasta - with a flavorful sauce my grandparents would proudly call 'gravy'.   And dont pass on the desert, the tiramisu was fresh, full of flavor and big enough to share!!!   Overall a 5 star performance!!! Thanks Donny!",

The dinner salad had my favorite things, Bleu cheese, olives, and balsamic vinaigrette. I finished my meal with the Manicotti and meatball. Delightful.

She prepared me a piece of fish differently than how it is prepped so that I could actually eat. She also listed every ingredient in what I ordered and cross checked with my list to ensure that I was being accommodated. Wonderful customer service and I would highly recommend to anyone who has any special dietary needs. Will be coming back!",

However, it was a cheap/cold baguette, like you get from Walmart, while we were expecting it would be made from scratch in the kitchen. The salad had too much seasoning and was made with vegetables that were most likely coming from a can.  Atmosphere: we sat by the gas fireplace which was pleasant. However, we found the decoration ugly and messy. Guns, swords, skulls and pirates on the wall were clashing with the rest of the decoration.  Service: Worst service ever. The waiter was pushy and kept watching us. When it was time to sign the check, the waiter was standing next to us telling us how much we should give him as tip (seriously?) He checked what we put as soon as we stood up.  Avoid yourself the trouble, try another restaurant. Also check the pictures I posted with the menu for Friday night. Quite overpriced IMHO, with the cheapest entree starting at $21.",

To summarize:        My husband myself and our daughter were seated around 8:10 on a Sunday evening.        Our drink orders were taken and served by three different people one at a time 10 minutes apart. One of the people that served us was a little girl  around 9  years old.       20 minutes later our order was taken and  we waited the best part of an hour just  to get our appetizers.           In the meantime another couple walked in and got their whole dinner from soup to nuts by the time we were served our salad.            After waiting 2 hours and not getting our dinner we decided to leave.          When we asked for the check our waitress Sarah became indignant,arrogant, and rude. She took her good old time getting our check and started taking someone else order at the bar while we waited. She presented us with a check for $80  which seems to be their MO from some of the reviews I unfortunately read too late!         The appetizers and crummy green salad we ate were not worth all that!          When I told the waitress Sarah we were going to complain to the owner Johnny she replied \" if you think I am rude wait til you talk to Johnny !!!!",

From the moment we walked in, the place is a gem; it's like an antique-lover's dream. The extraordinary relics mean there is never a lack of anything to look at; my dad and i were having fun just looking at all of the antiques, which the owner and his family have collected over the years. So extraordinary! And there is a speaker playing great songs, just the right volume; great song choices!  And the food...WOW. Simply fantastic. Stuffed mushrooms (recommended by our absolutely spot-on waitress, who is also a complete sweetheart) are excellent! Fresh salad was delicious and crisp; and when Donnie brought out his pepper-grinder the size of a stairway post, well that was both hilarious and a great touch. My entree was the Portobello Ravioli, and I ate every. Ounce. Of. It. I haven't cleaned my plate like that in quite a while, not at a restaurant! It was so good.  I think perhaps the best part was that when the owners heard that I had gotten accepted for a new position and was moving from out of state, they made both my dad and I a shot, on the house as a way to say congratulations; it was so sweet and kind of them! The shot was delish; tasted like a chocolate covered cherry, beautifully made! Also, something else; I had initially asked for a Moscow Mule as a starter drink, and our waitress didn't think they had the ingredients, so I ordered something else, no trouble for me. However, like 30 mins later our lovely lady brought me over an excellent Mule,because she had found the cups for it and the right kind of ginger beer:):) She definitely did not have to do that, and it was yet another example of their staff going the extra mile to make someone happy.  I never write Yelp reviews; I think I've written 3 my entire life, but I had to make a point that this place is great. Warm atmosphere, kind staff and owners, and fantastic Italian food. I will definitely go back there and we've told others about it as well. Thanks again Zarras!",

    "text": "NO STARS, Yelp makes you click at least one. This was hands down the WORST dining experience. We arrived and were one of only two tables in the restaurant. We were seated by a sixth grade child. We waited about 30 minutes to get waters. Quite a bit longer after that to get our salads and bread. We had to ask for the bread as they forgot to bring it. We ordered the salads with blue cheese and no anchovies. One salad was brought with anchovies and we had to say several times no we don't want that, after being asked if we were sure we didn't order with anchovies. After we ordered with the incredibly rude waiter, it took forever for our food to get out to the table. A few minutes after ordering the waiter came out and said they didn't have the ravioli that one of us ordered, and asked if he would have manicotti instead. He obliged, but was still charged the more expensive price of the ravioli, and received his good way after everyone else. When the food came out, one person was asked if they ordered anything, implying they had not. The food was sloppy, one entree was cold, the bread was stale, and my fettuccini Alfredo tasted like fish. One member of our party at his entree, the rest of us asked for it to go just to be polite, with no intentions of eating it. When we asked for our check, it was brought over a while later, with a 20% gratuity added to a table of only 5 people. Our food came to $138 for the entrees and one soda. They added a $27 gratuity which we did not agree with. We went to the front to let them know, where a man sitting at the bar drinking directed us to the bartender. We told them we didn't agree, and would not pay the $27 tip since that's something we should decide. They became rude and belligerent when we told them about the mistake not bringing out an entree, and that the food tasted like fish. The man at the bar kept getting involved, we told him it didn't concern him. After a few minutes I jokingly said \"what are you, the owner?\" to which he replied yes. He continued to fight with us loudly while continuing to eat and have his drink at the bar, with a very rude woman next to him getting involved as well. I find it so unprofessional to be drinking at the bar of your own restaurant. The real kicker to this was that in addition to the sixth grade girl serving us, they were two other boys younger than her serving, one who was family and the other a friend of the child, which seems dangerous and unprofessional. One of the worst restaurants I have ever been to, I will tell it to everyone I meet never to go here. Gordon Ramsay should tear this place down.",

The noodles were homemade and the sauce was easily some of the best I've had! Everything is made in house and extremely fresh. You can taste the love in everything from the salad dressing to the cheesecake (which I could eat literally everyday- I'm not kidding). On top of fantastic food, the atmosphere was warm and friendly and reminded me of a home straight out of southern Italy. The owners had their grandchildren \"helping\" to serve customers. It was so precious! The little ones and their friend were dressed to the nines and having a blast suggesting their favorite desserts and meeting the customers. I will definitely be back, and soon!",

I love the Romano instead of Parmesan on the eggplant. The owner brought their ravioli pins and showed them to the folks at the next table, detailing how they make the ravioli in house. The wife is the cook.  The only disappointment was that we were asked if we wanted blue cheese or anchovies on our house salad with no mention that they were an upcharge. We had such a tasty meal with great service we didn't say anything. Go there for a great meal with great service.",

Food was bland and not as flavorful as I was expecting from a family owned restaurant.  Appetizers (stuffed mushrooms) were cold and got our bread after our meal was served. No oil provided. I will say the waiter  did his very best to manage being short staffed that night. At the same time the owners who were up front could have helped him instead of the children.  My boyfriend had two ask for the check twice since we were leaving for another function. At least the waiter did apologize for the delay and provided us with a free cannoli.  Pittsburgh has amazing food options which we experienced but this one was a low point.  I do want to note that service was not consistent with all customers. Those who knew the staff or owners were served promptly and had their attention the most.  One table who arrived after us got their appetizers, bread with oil and beverages before our main entree.",

All the food is AMAZING! Staff is nice and friendly. Sit on the balcony of weather is nice.",

    "text": "Quite honestly the worst Italian we have ever eaten. Four of us were here from out of town for a Steelers/Browns game and stayed at the hotel across the street (a Renaissance Inn - pretty nice). The hotel had a sign for the restaurant and the staff recommended it. We checked in late and didn't want to hunt around on a rainy night, so we went for it. Beer was warm, Sangria was horrible, bread was bad grocery store crap, salads were marginal with way too much dressing.  Of the four entrees, on one was more than 50% eaten when we were done. $150 of bad, bad food. When we talked to the owner/manager (we think) and told him what we thought of the meal, he waved his hand and said \"sorry your food sucked\" and then walked away.   I got a Yelp account for the sole purpose of writing THIS review.   Horrible.",

The food (sorry Donny) was even better (albeit too plentiful).   I was sad to have left town only eating at Zarra's once.    Two years later, and with high expectations, I (with 4 others) were at Zarra's again.   In a word, FANTASTIC.     This place is great.  The food is terrific, the people who serve you are like family, and there is nothing not to like about this place.  Love it!",

Family owned - mamma is in the upstairs and Jr. waits tables - all food seems hand made, which means the pasta is fresh and the red sauce is yummy. The best thing on the menu is the eggplant in all forms. Meatballs and sausage are second rate, though. Grisly is the word that comes to mind. Stuffed mushrooms too bready. But the greens and beans are good and the dumpling soup is authentic with delish homemade broth and dumpling - ask to make sure it is cooked through to avoid it being sticky in the middle. Excellent chicken parmesan. The bottled beer list is good but pricey, as is the wine. So split an appetizer and a pasta dish and have just one glass of red and all will be well.",

I had the sample plate and it was perfect. A nice sampling of several southern Italian favorites. The wine kep coming, so we kept on eating and drinking.  For desert, try the cannolie and a nice espresso.  Next time that I am on Pittsburg, I am going.",

It's a little deceptive--you have to go through a bar in the front to the actual restaurant, where the decor is very nice, and the staff is friendly...and unbelievably incompetent.  I put in my order.  The waiter seemed to have trouble grasping which dish I wanted, so I opened the menu and pointed it out to him.  That was at 8 p.m.  By 8:30, I was wondering what the problem was.  Ten mintues after that, a waiter came over and asked if I'd ordered yet!   So I got a menu and pointed it out again, mentioning that I'd ordered it some time ago.  And ANOTHER twenty minutes passed before my salad, bread and main course arrived virtually simultaneously.  What, they couldn't have brought me the salad a little sooner, seeing as they'd screwed up so badly already?   The food was okay, but nothing special.  But don't come here unless you're planning to spend a LONG time waiting.  (And, no, no one apologized or even said anything about the wait.)",

    "text": "We are really laid back people who like just about anything and are willing to give most people/situations the benefit of the doubt.  As a longtime Yelp lurker, I used to read some of the poor reviews and wonder who really has an experience like that.  Now I know!    Three of us were visiting Pittsburgh for a weekend and staying at the hotel right across the street from Zarra's.  On Saturday, we got back to the Hotel late, didn't feel like going far afield and so wandered over.  We were seated right away as the restaurant was only about 1/3 full.  Things went downhill from there.    1. We were not greeted or offered drinks until 20 minutes after we sat down. 2. After we ordered, our appetizer came out, but still no drinks.   3. Our bread came out burnt. (One of us even scraped it onto his plate and no-one noticed or cared) 4. Our salads came out wrong. 5. One of us who ordered the Portabella Ravioli found a huge piece of eggshell in the filling. 6. The wait staff was virtually non-existent throughout.    We kept thinking things were going to get better, but by the time we managed to get the check (almost $50 each), we'd had enough.   We politely and calmly explained all of the above to our waiter, who handed back our credit card and said something like \"Okay, sorry, have a nice night.\"  We didn't know what to do with this -- we've never walked out on a bill before and we were not expecting a free ride.  So he said okay and disappeared for another 15 minutes -- we briefly saw him talking to the manager.  He finally came back, put the bill with our credit card on the table and walked away -- they hadn't reduced it at all!  Even worse, as we were leaving, the manager and all of the wait staff disappeared so that we couldn't even talk to them.    This was possibly our worst restaurant experience ever.",

    "text": "My friend and I stopped at Zarra's on a whitewater paddling trip a couple of weeks ago. Please be warned... this is not your neighborhood (american) Italian restaurant. If they did have any pizza or calzones I must have missed it because I was distracted by the extensive menu of authentic italian dishes. The hardest part of my experience was choosing what to eat. This is one of those places where you're not going to be choosing something you think you'll like, you're going to be deciding between dishes you know you'll love. The decision is made easier by Zarra's excellent family of staff.   We sat outside near the outdoor fireplace fueled by a real wood fire. The scene, smell of the kitchen mixed with the wood fire, and excellent company set the stage for a perfect evening.   I enjoyed a regional craft brew that was delicious, an appetizer sampler, and a seafood entree with a spicy red sauce over a seafood medley with pasta. The shrimp and scallop were huge and perfectly cooked. The scallop was especially savory.   We stayed for a couple hours eating, drinking, and taking in the city through this small neighborhood gem. When you do go inside take a look at the pictures on the walls and notice they are all family of the owners. If you're lucky John will tell you the history of the establishment, how he met his wife there, and came to own it so many years ago. When you go to Zarra's you'll feel like part of their italian family for sure. We liked it so much we went back for dinner the next night while we were still in town. After all, how can you say no to an authentic italian family dinner?",

    "text": "We first ate at Zarra's about 5 years ago, and we were immediately impressed by the food. My husband is Italian and his mother is an incredible cook, so we have high standards when it comes to Italian food. I had the Cavatelli con Polo Primavera di Judith and it was fantastic. That dish remains one of my favorites followed by the Linguine di Contosta with the spicy \"palmieri\" tomato sauce. I love red sauce, and can't believe how many different types of red sauce they make here, each more flavorful than the next.  My husband has worked his way through most of the menu, and his favorites include the Polenta Calabrese, Pasta e Fagoli and Cavatelli e Verdure di Rena. There are so many good dishes it's hard to pick a few to recommend! We may have started to go there because of the food but we remain loyal customers because of the people. Each time you dine at the restaurant it is as if you are being welcomed into the home of the Zarra family, and it's a place you don't want to leave anytime soon. Johnny, Judy, Donny and Jamie, as well as their entire staff make you feel welcomed and it's truly the best place to relax after a long work week (or work day!). We grew to love Zarra's so much, we even had our rehearsal dinner there, and our family is still talking about that night. We feel like Zarra's is one of the best kept secrets in the city, and want everyone to know what a phenomenal restaurant they are missing!",

I must admit the first time was much better and would've gotten it 4 maybe even 5 stars because our meal, especially the lobster ravioli was delicious and they gave us a complimentary dessert liquor at the end of dinner.  The second time we went the food was mediocre and, yes, it was overpriced.  BUT the atmosphere in this restaurant is what allows it to keep its dignity and maintain that 3 star rating.  There are several antique knick knacks around the seating area and that will help to spur up conversation no matter who you're with. The music is nice, Sinatra style tunes.  And it's cozy, the staff is very nice and due to its unlikely location on Bigelow it feels like you're dining in one of Pittsburgh's secret treasures.  I say, give it a try and create your own experience out of it.  You may find it completely worth it.  I know because the first time was such a delightful experience, that even after the second mediocre meal, I would give it a third try.  I love the restaurant's antique eccentric atmosphere.",
