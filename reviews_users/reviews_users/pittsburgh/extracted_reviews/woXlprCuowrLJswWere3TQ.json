    "text": "Maravilloso!!! Finally to experience Tako and wow.   Tako is so trendy.. dim lighting and funky decor offers a fun experience for a patron at any age.  I made reservations through yelp (of course) and received a confirmation through email the day of.   Me and my party arrived a little early and had a seat the bar where we received excellent service.   The dining area on the first floor is half booth and tables..  pretty close to each other - not so ideal for a private dining experience.  I was pleased to be seated upstairs where they are cool booths!!  It was perfect for a party of four (4).  Our waiter didn't miss a beat by saying hello right away and answered many of our questions (and took pictures too).   We started off with the guacamole.   The chips that accompanied the dip were thick and crisp.. so tasty.   Many have told me that Tako had the best guac and it was good but not the best I have ever had.  My taste buds searched for other flavors that weren't present..such as \"tomato\" or more of a an onion flavor.  It was obviously fresh but not as flavorful as expected.  My taste buds weren't singing.   I ordered the \"Bistec\" which was tacos with steak, shishito peppers, cilantro, red romaine and was DELICIOUS!!! I could have lived on this variation my whole life. Everything was fresh.. and plenty of cilantro.. love it!  Two tacos were $15.00 - but it's worth it. To accompany my tacos ... I wanted to try the \"Street Corn\" side which was only $6.00.   It sounded so interesting. I expected loose corn but instead three small pieces of corn on the cob arrived.. smothered with Siracha Mayo, chil, cheese and lime.    It was different and very flavorful. There were more toppings on the corn than actual corn.  It was difficult to eat - but delicious at the same time.    Don't let some of the prices fool you.. there are plenty of \"starters\" available if you are on a budget and its worth the experience.   I parked at the parking garage on the corner of sixth and fort duq and it was only $7.00    Dining at Tako was a great experience and I cannot wait to go back!!!!!!! !",

From the dim lighting and unique light fixtures, to the balcony railing and booths upstairs ... It all just made the dining experience that much better.   But most importantly, the food. The guacamole MTO menu was awesome. We got the traditional guac with just one added item and it was delicious. The papas bravas were also a 10. Perfectly cooked, not too spicy, with just the right amount of some sort of special sauce on top. Last, the pollo asada tacos had so much flavor. For two fairly small tortillas, they packed so much inside and the flavor combination was great.   Lastly, the cocktail of the day was a frozen margarita with cinnamon and fireball, which also exceeded my expectations.   If I only had room for dessert... I would have ordered the churros funnel cake. I guess I'll have to go back again?",

    "text": "I could have SWORN I already wrote a review for tako after I dined here this summer.  Perhaps I enjoyed it so much that I only wrote the review in my mind and never magically posted it to Yelp.  Since I'm getting older and my memory isn't as sharp as it was I can't give a detailed review.  I will say this - what a cool place and a win for Pittsburgh.  Located in the heart of the cultural district tako is a seriously hot spot that you must try.  But do your best to get a reservation because this place is busy all. the. time.  I like that the kitchen sits facing the street and is open for all to see the magic happening on the grill.  There is also limited outdoor, sidewalk seating, but also a few bar stools facing the kitchen.  Tres cool.  This restaurant is pretty small and if I had to guess has 30 tables total.  There are two floors for seating and if you're upstairs it is kind of like a loft and you can look to the tables on the first floor.  I mentioned earlier in this review that I'm not the young whipper snapper I once was and my next comment supports that statement.  It is dark in here.  So much so that my friends and I used the flashlights on our iPhones to read the menu.  Yeah, we're pretty lame.  But not so lame that we were at one of the coolest restaurants in town.  Awesome selection of tacos, including duck confit (pronounced con-feet).  My friends joked with me on my lame pronunciation so I'll help the other yinzers out with the phonetics.    I'll be back and when I do I'll update my review and focus on the food.",

A group of 4 of us were seated 40 minutes after putting our name on the list- and were informed they were full on the inside and no longer seating people there. After ordering and waiting for 45 minutes, we came inside due to impromptu rain which soaked the seats we were sitting on. Miraculously, they were able to find a booth upstairs after one of the people in our party put up a fuss. Unless you're willing to wait an insane amount of time for average tacos, go elsewhere. And my octopus tacos were burnt!",

    "text": "The food is delicious. My husband is from Pittsburgh, and upon knowing we would get a rare night out bc his parents were watching our daughter, we made a reservation due to a recommendation from a friend. We were 15 min late bc of traffic and called to let them know; the host said it was no problem. Our waiter was nice, but a little pushy with getting our order. He seemed rushed. We shrugged it off and ordered the drinks, which were very good, the poke, and two types of tacos. All the food was also delicious; we highly recommend the octopus tacos and my margaritas were really good. We were thoroughly enjoying a rare night out when I decided to order a second margarita. It took about 15 min to show up, but we were happily eating, so I didn't mind. Not even 5 minutes after I received my drink and as I was taking a bite of my taco (I had only just started it), the waiter quickly slapped the check down on the table and said \"I'll take that when you're ready.\" What??? I worked in restaurants for years, and hate it when people camp out, but we were NOT doing that at all since we had full drinks and half our meal left. We wanted to order dessert, but felt weird doing so. As I finished eating (faster than I'd like), the hostess kept walking behind the table staring at the tab. We never even saw the waiter again. It was so obvious that they wanted us out and it really ruined the perception we had of the restaurant and the enjoyment of our night out. I've never experienced that, especially in a place where I dropped a hundred bucks on two people. No matter how amazing the food is, no one wants to feel like they are being pushed out an hour into dinner. It was unfortunate.",

The service was good and everything came out quickly, which was nice.  Guacamole- we ordered the one that had duck confit since I thought it sounded interesting and different than anything that I had in the past. It was just okay, I had expected the duck to be warm but it was cold. The portion was also a bit small for the $18 price tag.  Poke - The poke is served with these popped rice crisps, which led to the execution to be off. When I had one with a rice crisp, it broke and I ended up dropping some poke on the ground. It was good with the corn chips that I had kept from the guacamole.  Tacos - we ordered and shared the bistecca and the mushroom tacos. They were pretty good but pricey.  Drinks - we had the spicy cucumber and pineapple jalapeno.   Overall, the food was good but I don't think I will be going back.",

Tables are so close together you hear every word of your neighbors conversation and the wait staff can barely squeeze between them.   Food mediocre at best. Crab nachos were the best item we ordered. Down hill from there. $19 steak taco arrived cold and tasted like a cold slice of roast beef with a heavily dressed kale salad. Also ordered \"margaritas with a top shelf tequila\" we were serve the El Jeffe which was $30 each!!! We did not have a drink menu in our hands and expected $12-15 as is customary around town and other cities. We were shocked to receive a bill of $253 for nachos, guacamole, 4 tacos and 4 margaritas. The management was less than accommodating when we questioned the bill. Stayed the cost of ingredients justified the price tag. Will NEVER return to this overpriced, overrated establishment. Quick note - there is only ONE unisex toilet in the entire place. Be prepared for a long line and a wait if you need to use the restroom.",

Impossible....until last night!  We went to the Grit and Grace late night Happy Hour for some amazing snacks and drinks and wanted to finish with an amazing meal. I've been dying to get in to Tako. I have seriously been waiting since the day it opened! We walked up at about 10:30 pm and they were able to seat us!   The ambience in this place is sexy and fun. The red lights and the giant cracken in the wall are so damn cool. Even though the tables were super close I had no trouble focusing on the conversation at the table.  There is an upstairs that looked pretty great. I'd like to try that next time.  We ordered the quacamole with the editions of pepita, bacon, pineapple, and charred poblanos. It was perfection. The chips are thin and crispy and salty perfection.  My friend ordered the Duck Confit taco. Damn. Damn. It was so good. I was hoping he'd offer me more. But I took the liberty of sipping on his drink with out permission so...I won. He had the El Diablo. The drink was so good and fresh with ginger beer and lime that I'm dying too go back for the drinks alone! I had the Chicken Asado. It was classic with avacodo and crema. My favorites! It was the best chicken taco I've ever had.   If you plan to visit Tako you have 2 choices.... waaay advanced reservations or a late, late night meal. Either way DO IT!",

If you are looking to experience Tako on a weekend I would strongly recommend getting their upon opening to get your preferred seating or a space at the bar.

Once we were seated on the much quieter second floor overlooking downstairs, we dived straight into the menus.   A mix of good and bad, but mostly good. The apple cranberry margarita I ordered was strong, but I could not taste the apple cranberry at all. It tasted more like raspberry to me? We created our own guac to share and added smoked salmon, corn, and onion. We thought the salmon would be raw, but it wasn't. Still good, but a little disappointing. But their chips are tasty!  My chorizo tacos (chorizo, egg, cheese, cilantro) were great other than the mysterious sweet flavor that bothered me a little, partly because I didn't know where it was coming from. The tacos are not large, but I'd say two of them plus sharing an appetizer and dessert are perfectly enough for dinner. The churro/funnel cake we got for dessert was not good. I wanted it to be hotter and crispier, and I didn't think the fruitiness worked well with the rest of it.   Interesting decor, good service, and good tacos.

But the missing hospitality is worth dealing with for the outstanding food and cocktails. Fresh guacamole  salted chips was the perfect start. We had shrimp tacos, carnitas and pork shoulder taco. All were amazing!  The cocktails - spicy cucumber margarita was my favorite.",

Made the mistake of thinking they were open until 11 and it was only 10 so I unfortunately was that jerk who showed up 30 minutes before close, and our server was still awesome to us and didn't rush us whatsoever. (this may not seem like a huge deal to most, but after 13 years in the industry I know giving great service when you're about 10 minutes from being out the door is pretty damn hard.) Cant wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!",

The staff is incredibly friendly, and the bartenders do an excellent job of keeping up when the place gets slammed about 8pm on a Saturday. I'd definitely make reservations as this place stays steadily busy. I had the al pastor tacos and the pork was incredibly tender and perfectly marinated. The pineapple was plentiful as well but not over bearing. The street corn was also excellent. It was a little creamier than most but it was still packed with flavor.",

    "text": "I've been dying to actually eat at this place since it opened, so I was pretty excited to finally come for dinner yesterday to celebrate some good food, good friends and another Mini of graduate school come to an end. I was not disappointed.  Let's start with the Food experience:   We came at prime dinner time with a party of 6. As the place is smaller, filled with two seaters, a lively bar, we were seated upstairs in one of their few booths. I love this. From the top, you get a view of the whole restaurants, where you can watch the people below dine, the food servers scrambling about caring the open faced tacos which sizzle and smell tantalizing. The menu is simple: One half is starters, starting with chips and salsa, and ending poke, chopped and papa bravas [variety ensembles of salads and small bites], the second half is filled with their signature tacos which are serve in sets of 2. On the back of the menu you find an array of signature cocktails made from their wall of tequilas and mezcal. [more on that later]. In addition, there is a daily specials menu highlighting some of their fresh ensembles of the day and a crazy \"build-your-own\" guacamole bar, which my friend J was ALL OVER.   We ordered the Chips and Salsa as well as the selection of guac that J crafted together as we waited for our drinks. My \"Sookie Stackhouse\", a frozen margarita style drink, garnished with a special set of wax poured FANGS. I enjoy the occasional gimmick like that. It was served with homemade tortilla chips and a generous heaping of cilantro on guac, which, btw, was creamy with some depth in flavor.  I did a split with a friend for the taco. I HAD to try the Tako Taco, for one, as it is the namesake taco, made with Tako's patron spirit animal [Octopus] as the star ingredient, as well as the Mushroom Taco, a veggie taco with Mushrooms and burnt brussels. Floored. By the nth degree, the Mushroom stole the show. A good balance of veggies, paired with oaxaca cheese and garlic aioli. Absolutely fantastic. While the Octopus was done really well, I was upset that it was slightly buried by the accompanying harissa aioli. I personally would have made it more lemony because I love lemony Tako, but as with everything, that's just personal preference. However, it granted me my additional delight of eating a Tako Taco and thereby referencing my favorite youtube video show MPGIS [in this case episode 41]. I chuckle... anyways, moving on.  Service was great with a decisive flow to it. Jacen is great, vivacious, and made sure that we were served with good speed and recommendations. Definitely a thrill. Impending service was equally executed. My reservation was completed online and so they called to remind me of my reservation both by email, as well as via phone call and we easily were guided to our seats upon arrival.   Now to my favorite parts of the restaurant:  First, the decor. The art around the room is fantastic. For its namesake, Tako, there is a huge Octopus covering the main wall. From the top floor, you look the beast square in the eye, from the lower level, it towers over the patrons, watching them devour tacos or simply waiting itself to devour the patrons, take your pick. On the top wall, you get a view of the last supper. Quite ominous.  Second, the garage style kitchen. Watch your tacos be made right from the sidewalk view or have them served to you street side . I'm totally interested how they are going to do this in the Winter time.   Third and final, the duality between the restaurants. With the same owners, Tako mirrors and compliments the space of butcher and the rye next door. From the linking walkway between the restaurants, to the opposite placements of the kitchens and the back-to-back bars, it creates split yet intermingled worlds, one in the depths of bourbon and rye, the other a world of tequilas and mezcal. In the end they are all drawn together under the watching eye of the Octopus.  The experience at Tako is solid, the food is complex and delectable, giving the patrons an opportunity to dive into a dark world for a couple of hours outside the real world. A solid 4.5 stars, which will only be topped once I sit at the bar, stare into the cooking fires making the remaining menu items I left untasted and hear the gentle shaking of ice in making another S. Warren cocktail, only the essence and standard I expect of a DeSchantz establishment.",

If it's just you then sit outside at the taco bar on the street facing the kitchen. Think street-side sushi bar but tacos. I came two nights in a row.

    "text": "It's time. It's time I finally share the wonders of tako. Maybe, although I've bellied up to the bar (for food, too, okay?) often, I haven't shared my experiences because I wanted to keep this secret all to myself. Well THAT obviously didn't work!   Let's begin with offerings from the bar. DO indulge! A classic margarita perhaps? A Ramon Gin Fizz? Maybe a Spicy Cucumber or a Classic Daiquiri or an Anjeo Witch or......SO many well created cocktails from which to choose. Or maybe a frozen concoction or interesting beer? Let your bartender guide you...some of the best in town are behind the stick.  On to the food. If you're a lover of guacamole, THIS is the best in town. You're given a slip of paper with add ins for your custom guac to check off with abandon. My hands down favorite combo is bacon (if nothing else, GET THE BACON!), roasted poblano and blue cheese. And the chips! Whoa.   The tacos. More to the point, the tako tacos. The Japanese word for octopus is tako, hence the tako taco is an octopus one. And it's delicious! My first experience with the cephalopod, I'd say it tastes like a cross between lobster and shrimp with a similar texture.   More traditional? Don't miss the carnitas or al pastor tacos or if you'd like to step outside of the box without going all the way to octopus, the Korean tacos are an umami bomb of tender wagyu beef, fermented cucumber, pickled carrots and peanuts.   The atmosphere is comfortable, sexy even. If you're lucky enough to score a swing out seat on the sidewalk out front of the open kitchen, grab it! Oh, and word has it that brunch is coming soon. Shhhhhhhh...let's keep it out secret.",

I have had my eye on tako for many months but its kinda hard to get into because its a popular hotspot for dinner/drinks. Myself and two coworkers were able to snag a 5:30 reservation and this has just become my favorite taco place ever. Let me start with atmosphere. This place is just plain cool. From the sidewalk there is a walkup taco window with a bar and some stools that opens in the summer for walk-up patrons. The giant wood front door is gorgeous and mysterious, setting the tone for the decor inside. The inside looks like a super hip underground taco-lair with graffiti, neon lights, and thumping music (only downside was it was a tad loud). The kitchen is surrounded by windows which I love because (as I've mentioned in other reviews) it shows patrons the kitchen has nothing to hide. Next - THE DRINKS. Myself and a coworker had a jalapeno-pineapple marg that was TO DIE FOR. My other coworker had a watermelon basil marg and it was equally as refreshing and delicious. Like load me up with those, throw me on a beach, supply never ending tacos, and I'm a happy gal. We started with fresh chips and guac and it was soooooo yummy that we killed the first bowl and ordered another! Then we decided we were ready to dive into tacos so we ordered a few different styles to share. Each taco order comes with two pretty decent sized tacos (as you continue reading please know we over-ordered on accident and 3 women did not devour 8 \"decent sized tacos\" but even if we did, that'd be amazing). We ordered carnitas, lamb, shrimp, and al pastor tacos and each one was mouth watering-ly amazing. These tacos were LOADED with filling - so much so I had to use a fork and knife to tackle them. Also lastly, our waitress was awesome. I was so so so stuffed and so satisfied leaving this place. I will absolutely be coming back every time I visit Pittsburgh!",

Queso fundido had the traditional Mexican taste with a lil twist of Japanese fusion with the addition of shishito peppers. Came with delicious handmade flour tortillas.  Thrice cooked wings were amazing! Delicious flavor with the fish sauce base, and were super crispy.  Al pastor tacos - meat was delicious and tender. Was a bit weary of the pineapples, but everything went together very well. Wrapped with their awesome handmade tortillas.  Dessert - cheesecake was not what you would expect in a cheesecake. It was more like a deconstructed cheesecake, but the flavors were amazing and hit the spot. Homemade vanilla ice cream and blueberry sauce. Berries were fresh and tasty. Only thing missing from this dessert was the crust.  Damien was our server, and he was great! Very attentive and had great recommendations.",

    "text": "I am torn between three and four stars.  I want to give them six stars for the superb food, but the service is extremely lacking.    My husband and I have been to Tako twice.  The first time was an utter disaster with our appetizer forgotten, and ordered more takos to make up for it at the end.  My husband and our table were sprayed with water coming from the soda gun at the bar.  Our waiter was only concerned about the cute girls beside us.  We were practically ignored. The manager finally came over when we said don't bring us more takos just let us leave.  The manager was completely appropriate and gave us our meal with tacos to go.  It was quiet a while before we tried it again.  It wasn't as bad as the first visit, but still sub-par service. The second round, after being there for thirty minutes I couldn't get my waitress's attention to ask for more water.  She did not make eye contact with me.  Even when I am walking in and out of the restaurant, the staff does not even stop to let me through as they must be more important than I am.  I just do not understand this mentality.   However..... the tacos are so freaking good.  The Tako taco is so delicious with the most perfectly cooked octopus I have ever eaten (not chewy, which is so hard to do)! The octopus is complemented with delicious lemon vinegarette and crispy chickpeas, OMG!!! Cannot get enough.  The other tacos we had were also delicious including lamb barbacoa and duck.  So good!! Plus the guacamole: chorizo and goat cheese.  We almost licked the bowl.    YUM YUM YUM!  But I will probably get take-out takos from here on out.  Delicious food without the subpar hipster we are too good for you servers.",

I wish there was a mix & match option so I could have tried more because they all looked good!  My Al Pastor tacos with pork shoulder + pineapple were the perfect combo of sweet and spicy. We shared the street corn, which was so spicy and rich and amazing it was almost like mac & cheese somehow. We didn't try to customized guacamole this time, but the options looked delicious. They were super accommodating to a severe gluten allergy in our party, but they don't offer much for g/f drinks. (No ciders, just wine or cocktails.)  The atmosphere is very cool. It's dark and loud inside, with a live DJ, dimmed red chandeliers, and some very cool octopus art on the wall. The vibe here is awesome. If you're expecting a well-lit, quiet dining experience, look elsewhere. :) Service was extremely quick, but I'm not sure if that's the norm depending on how busy they are. Dress code is casual/trendy.  Overall great experience and plan to return ASAP! I'd recommend making a reservation.",

The street corn is awesome when they have fresh corn on the cob. It's not as good when corn on the cob is not in season, and they use can corn served in a bowl.",

We were seated at a table that was literally inches away from the hostess stand, where the hostesses were making phone calls, leaning over the iPad, grabbing menus and talking to other guests. The only thing separating us from the stand was a thin piece of dusty latticework-someone who works at the restaurant should really take a look at that thing from the vantage point of the patron who's sitting on the other side of it during dinner service, and maybe give it a wipe down. It's cool that the restaurant has a live DJ, but the music was so loud that we couldn't have a conversation with each other without yelling.  The unisex bathroom wasn't the cleanest-it had a pretty stinky urinal. All of this being said, our waitress was friendly and the service was good. The food was decent but not amazing.",

I travel 2-3 weeks a month and eating at the bar is my usual location and I will always wait for an opening. I was third down peering down the bar looking for that person who was close to wrapping it up. It took about 15 minutes to get the stool. Coincidently two spots opened and I sat next to number 2 inline and elderly lady who appeared to be a regular. Now being a newbie I didn't realize until I looked at the menu this is a Taco bar, but not just your average, run of the mill tacos. They are and I am not sure it's the right term, gourmet tacos. They also have a great variety of apps, and unfortunately since I was solo, and didn't want to fill up on it, but they have a build your own guac!! I have to figure out a way to do this, I was about to ask my line partner, but she ordered before I could. So to the food, I started with the kale and avocado salad, STRONG!!! Incredibly tasty with 1/2 sliced avo, so I got my health on with some good greens and good fat!! For the tacos I got the Pollo Asado and again avocados, they were OUTSTANDING, you get two good sized tacos, very flavorful and right proportion of everything. I love that this place is a block away from my hotel!! This place will on my regular rotation on my travels to Pittsburgh.",

Once seated, we were immediately told by a staff member who wasn't even our server that the kitchen would be closing at 10pm and we had to order as soon as possible. During our entire experience, we were made to feel like an inconvenience to the wait staff and the runner who slammed our food on the table. They made very clear that we were not welcome and were inhibiting them from closing and leaving for the night. The quality of the food was overshadowed by the unacceptable and judgmental service. If a 9:45pm reservation was such an issue than that time slot should not be made available and we should have been contacting prior to arriving.  Overall, horrible experience and waste of money and time.",

The wings: crazy good, they're crispy, sticky-sweet and that dash of fish sauce makes them memorable.   The guac: I've had better. The chips tasted like the oil in the fryer needed changed, but I loved the presentation in the box.  The queso chorizo: topped with shishito peppers, it's super cheesy goodness.  The Tacos: octopus taco, which is their signature menu item was kind of flavorless and chewy. There is a finesse to cooking octopus that I don't feel was executed on my taco. The Korean beef taco was the most flavorful, I'm not sure I was breathing I ate it so fast. The shrimp taco was okay, al pastor was also okay. Overall, the tacos felt hit or miss.   Spicy Pineapple Margarita: make sure you order this--a really cool signature drink that's well executed.  My favorite part of this place is the atmosphere. The overall aesthetic is rich and well-executed. Even the bathroom was amazingly on-brand.  Is this a place to check out? Yes. Is it the best taco place in the world? I'll let you be the judge.",

    "text": "Yelp is the reason I elected to go to Tako and I'm glad I went but overall, it is WAY over-hyped.  First of all, many reviews said you had to make a reservation well in advance and they were right so I made mine a month ahead of my visit to Pittsburgh.  When I went to make the reservation, the only time slots they had for Friday night for two were 5pm and 10:00pm.  I went with the 5pm and when we got there at 5, we were the ONLY ones there.  And in the hour that we sat there, the restaurant only seated a few other tables.  It was mostly empty the entire time which was odd since the reservations are so \"highly sought after.\"  The actual space is super cool.  The entrance looks a little \"speakeasy-ish\" which is all the rage these days in places like New York City and Chicago so I think that's what they were going for here.  I loved the octopus handles on the door and the interior was super cool.  It is very dark in there which provides a romantic atmosphere.  The hot pink chandeliers are lovely.  Great interior!  The service was fine.  Our waitress was nice and we didn't have to wait long for anything which was great.  The food was just ho-hum for the price.  I can't believe how much we paid for what we got!  It was outrageous.  We started out with Margaritas.  My fiance got the frozen blackberry margarita and I got a regular watermelon basil one.  In hindsight, I wish I had gone frozen as well seeing as my margarita was almost entirely ice.  It was tasty but it only lasted a couple of seconds.  Not worth the cost!  I ordered a poke bowl and I guess I am super spoiled because I live in a town where Poke restaurants are popping up everywhere.  This poke bowl was so small and not filling at all.  I would not recommend it, whatsoever.  If you want poke, just get in the car and head to Columbus and check out Hai Poke or Poke Brothers.  They know what's up.  I also ordered a plate of the steak tacos and they were good but WAY too salty.  And so small for the price.  I was just astounded by the quality of the food versus the cost.    We spent $78 for four small tacos, two margaritas (one that was mostly ice), and a small poke bowl.  We didn't get any chips or anything like that.  Just not worth it.  If you're only in town for a short time like we are, don't waste your time here - go to Gaucho's!!!",

    "text": "This place struck a little bit below expectations, but was still very good as far as taco places go. I would definitely get a reservation as the place was packed on a Sunday evening. One good thing is that they do seem to take reservation blocks seriously. We were seated immediately when we arrived for our time and were asked to leave after 1.5 hours to allow for the next reservation. May not be the best place for extended drinks and catching up with friends, but at least the reservations are timely.   They offer a wide selection of cocktails and Mexican beers. The guacamole was tasty, but the portion size is rather small and they give you about 3x the amount of chips you could eat for the guac. Not sure if it's worth the $14.  These tacos on the other hand are above average in serving size for a taco. I would say 2-3 tacos is pretty filling for the average person. Orders come with 2 each and we ended up getting the 'Big Board' which comes with 6 orders of tacos.  - Steak tacos: nice flavor but rather chewy and tough beef - Shrimp tempura: nice crispy shrimp. Not much I would change - pastor: my friend had this one but I didn't try it. Apparently very very salty and the pineapples were clearly straight from a can or something. Def not flavored or grilled.  - octopus: interesting flavor. Comes topped with again, what tastes like grapefruit straight out of a fruit cup. Octopus tasted over cooked and tough.  - Korean: probably my favorite one. Beef was tender and well marinated with a nice contrast of pickled cucumbers on top.",

The service was great and the workers were friendly. Only drawback is deciding which tacos to get. Bring a friend or two so you can get a sampling of more than one of the great tacos they have. I would come back to Pittsburgh just for these tacos.  ***Update: I had to return to ensure I wasn't just starving and measure quality consistency. After a second trip, I can honestly state again the best tacos I've had. For future patrons' benefit(mostly mine), I had the pastor (pork shoulder) again, and the chicken tacos. Pastor just as good as the last time and the chicken was also outstanding. Everything is very well executed. This is a place definitely worth the trip. If not a party of more than three, I suggest sitting at the bar outside and watching the kitchen work. It's a great experience!",

It also took forever to get our first round of drinks and it looked like they only had one bartender working.   We arrived 15 minutes prior to our reservation time and we were promptly seated. We didn't expect that, but we were pleasantly surprised!  We started with the chips and salsa and the queso fundido. Great portions on both of these. We had three salsas and all were absolutely delicious. We also ordered the pineapple jalapeno margarita and the grapefruit sage margarita.  We were impressed by the size of the entree tacos. The shells were packed full of protein and add ins. We ordered the bistec tacos and the fried chicken tacos. The fried chicken was on the specials list and it was underwhelming. However, the bistec was excellent. The meat was seasoned to perfection and cooked just to the right temperature. Would definitely order those again.   For a second round of drinks, we ordered the watermelon margarita and the mezcal smash. Unless you'd had mezcal before and really enjoy the unique flavor, I would NOT recommend this cocktail. It had a terrible aftertaste (but that might just be the typical taste of mezcal). The pineapple jalapeno margarita was definitely the best cocktail of the evening hands down.   As for the ambience, it was small, crowded, dimly lit, and loud. Probably not the best location for a first date. However, we enjoyed the atmosphere and DJ was throwing down some awesome old school tunes.   We found the prices pretty reasonable for the portion sizes. I'm confident we'll return in the future to explore more of the unique taco and cocktail pairings.",

    "text": "I finally got a chance to visit the infamous Tako!!!!! We did make a reservation, but it didn't seem like it would have been necessary when we got there. I love the atmosphere -  dim lights with cool beats and sounds. I started the evening off with the Thai Coconut drink, and it was very delicious with a little kick For appetizers, I ordered the Thrice Cooked Wings. Ok, so the fish sauce smell will definitely make you lean back when you put the wing to your mouth. However, once tasting it....I wasn't able to stop eating it. And for the entree, I ordered the Pollo Asado. It was good but a bit spicy in some bites of it. In one bite, I thought I was on fire!!!!!! It took for ever for my mouth and throat to cool off. The flavor of the chicken was ok. My friend ordered Poke for her appetizer. I tasted it, but wasn't a fan. But in Tako's defense, I am not a huge sushi fan. But she loved it! The service was nice, and they did not feel too overbearing. Which is always a plus for me.  Now, would I come back......hmmm, yes I would. It iis just, nothing was measuring up to all the rave. But it isnt bad. I think it is another cool spot in the downtown area for a date night or a little din din before a show. But honestly, I think this restaurant has been a bit hyped up, for some odd reason.",

    "text": "Tako is a great experience and the food is unique and delicious once or twice to find a favorite or cover the menu. Loud, small, and different, it is a great place with a fun  quasi-casual experience at fine dining prices. IMHO  once or twice covers what this place offers for most people. I have to admit that the value perspective is starting to move into profiteering because prices are increasing, ingredients are missing since I  first experienced it. Have they jumped the shark on the concept? (For example  chips and salsa w/guacamole was $14 for half a cup. The chips may have been flash fried but that's pricey for a side). I ordered an octopus  (signature and my fav.) and a Korean tacos (for her- too bland for me) + chips and salsa to-go, came to ~65.00. For take-out... yes, for take-out. The best value is the \"Board\" ($90 item) to sample enough to find my favorites and take some home. I ended up previously just sitting at the bar, ordering it, and taking about half home.  As I said, great one off date night, but I fear quality control if starting to slip. I've noticed the ingredients for the octopus is almost bland, no citrus, and inconsistent quality, and there are fewer unique items and a ton of sauce drowned out everything. It seems like they are trying to squeeze out more profit by reducing the content. I was/am a fan, but won't go back there as much to keep the memory of my first experience alive. Again, it is unique, and probably no where else offers quite the same dishes but it is still just a soft taco.",

    "text": "Stopped in for the first time tonight (Thursday, 9:30pm) and was shocked to find the place still packed. Fortunately we were able to get a table, and soon were delighted to find out that today marked the start of a new menu. Seeing the word 'butternut', I immediately opted for the appetizer, and picked the salmon tacos as my second must-try. The grapefruit sage margarita? Necessary as well.  Grapefruit sage margarita: pleasantly surprised by the fresh grapefruit flavor and the alcohol content  Butternut tostada: the highlight of this app was the spiced honey which really was only on the plate below the tostada. The butternut squash flavor was good, but there was too much ricotta. This would have been significantly better as a warm dish with the honey drizzled on top.  Salmon tacos: perfect. Each of the two tacos had a fillet of salmon all to itself. Perfectly cooked, melt-in-yo-mouth salmon combined with guac and pickled red onion makes for a happy me.  Choco tacos: better (and also less chocolatey) than I expected. Waffle cone taco, lined with chocolate on the inside, chocolate around the rim. Filled with avocado lime ice cream (you really only taste the lime). Topped with strawberry pieces/syrup and coconut crumble cookies. Yes there's a lot going on, but yes, it's interesting and really great to split between two people (two tacos).  I will say you should be prepared for not much attention from the server as this spot is very busy. However, the food did arrive quickly.   I really enjoyed the experience and the addition this place makes to downtown. Great place to try if you are in the mood for drinks and tacos (aka always) and are in the downtown area.",

When you walk into the door you actually are pulling open the freezer door and it is just so interesting and then the atmosphere is fun and exuberant and lively.  This is another one of the great opportunities in Pittsburgh to enter the atmosphere of a chef owned restaurant and I was extremely excited to try their food!  We decided to take tacos to go because we were going to catch a movie on the southside.  We ordered chicken tacos which were absolutely divinely fabulous. They had more chicken in them than any chicken taco I've ever put my mouth and they were fabulous.  Most of the time when I buy chicken taco I get more fluff the chicken but in this case it was loaded and it was fantastic.  We also ordered the mushroom and sweet potato and it also was incredibly unique flavor and the sweet potatoes were just very well seasoned and the combination between the sweet potatoes in the mushrooms it was just something you have to try.  Apparently they're known for their octopus tacos but I couldn't get myself to try that because I wasn't sure if I would like octopus.  All in all whether you eat in or take out this place will leave an impression on your heart because the people that work there are friendly and accommodating and it looks like between the service and the food they're doing very well!  Make sure you put this on your food bucket list when you come to Pittsburgh because it will definitely the one for the record!",

Some interesting drinks and a fun bartender.  I had the red sangria with lots of fresh fruit. Better than my own.  SWMBO had a margarita and was truly satisfied.  We started with a build your own guac that had some bacon and blue cheese and a few other items.  Really good, the blue cheese worked well with the sweet guac and the bacon!  Really good chips too!     We spit our taco orders since you get 2 tacos. The Mushroom with garlic aioli and truffle salsa with brussel sprouts was the better of the two and very good.  The Korean with wagyu short rib, peanuts, napa cabbage and cilantro was OK.  The cilantro and seasoning gave it a nice flavor and a little heat but some of the short rib was over grilled/charred to a crisp. Unfortunately due to the over grilling some of the meat was tasteless and hard to eat. Will definitely go back some time to try some other items on the menu.  The price of the meal and drinks seems to follow a local trend, where probably a little pricey for what you get, but still overall a good meal and good place to enjoy the cuisine.",

We found out about it when we went to Butcher and the Rye and we were so glad- they are both owner by the same company.   Their appetizers and dessert are extremely good, fresh, high in flavor and all about balance in spice/heat. Decor is fun, trendy and the music was upbeat and fun.  We wents a few weeks back so I don't know the exact name of what we got but the corn appetizer was amazing and I really enjoyed the ahi tuna and pico dish. Really good experience and will go back any chance we get.",

    "text": "My boyfriend brought me here for our 3-year anniversary, as we've been trying to get reservations for the last year or so. I was super excited, but that feeling quickly faded for both of us as the evening went on.   First, the service was pretty mediocre.  Dude kept cutting off our sentences and came over whenever he felt like it despite it being later at night and not incredibly packed.  I asked for a drink recommendation that wasn't too sweet, and he recommended what was probably the sweetest drink on the menu.  Strike one.   Second, the make your own guacamole was delicious but I think $18 for an appetizer is ridiculous.  We got bacon in it and they were these giant chunks that were hard to pick up. No. Strike two.   Third and most disappointing was their signature \"Tako\" made with octopus.  I'm amazed that everyone on yelp seems to be in love with them because we both almost threw up at whatever licorice-flavored oil or sauce was on the taco.  This flavor was NOT indicated on the menu and when I asked the sever about it he basically looked at me like I was crazy, as did the two rude women sitting next to us.  We didn't eat the tacos and nothing was taken off the bill or offered to make right.  I don't complain about food very often, but when you're paying $16 for two tiny tacos and you've already spent $100 on food, consideration would be nice.   Strike three.    The two star rating instead of one comes from their Choco taco dessert - amazing.  However, after getting home I became sick.  it's just too many flavors and too much stuff.  If you want an amazing taco, go to Doce Taqueria in the SS and save about 85 bucks.    I like to think that people in burgh know good food, but the yelp rating of this place tells me otherwise.  Not sure why this place is so hard to get into when there are so many other amazing places to go.  If only the restaurant would have put forth half as much effort as my wonderful boyfriend to give me a wonderful experience...",

Tacos are my favorite food and everywhere I go I make its my mission to have the best tacos in town. I was extremely disappointed in my experience at Tako. The tacos were very average, and a bit over priced. They did have fun and interesting ingredients, however, the recipes were not executed well. On top of that, the service was not good, and this is coming from someone who worked in the restaurant business for 3.5  years. The server acted annoyed about any questions we had on the menu, (I always ask my server what's best since they seem to always know) and took forever to bring us anything, including our drinks and chips and salsa. I would have to say this place is not worth the hype.",

    "text": "Ambiance:  First thing I noticed when I walked in was the six or so sidewalk bar seats outside facing the restaurant with the kitchen right in the front.  Looked like a great place to sit on a nice day.  Next was the kitchen itself, glassed in and with about 8 people crafting plates.  It was nice to see tortillas being freshly pressed.  The actual dinning room consists of a long line of two person high tables on the left a bar on the right and an upstairs area where some larger booths are located, which can accommodate a group of up to six.  The restaurant is decorated in a Gothic meets modern industrial meets Latin style which was well executed.  Unfortunately it was only about 55 degrees outside and they were running the AC which made the downstairs tables quite chilly.  Drinks: Tried the spicy cucumber marg as well as the anjeo and absinthe one.  Both were well done.  They had a selection of primarily Mexican and Asian beers starting around 4 bucks.  Interesting cocktail list as well and would definitely like to try their sangria at some point.  Food: We started with the Chef's Choice #5 guac which had crab, cojita cheese, and peppers.  It was Amazing!...could seriously eat that every day.  Next we split three orders of tacos, which come with two per order.  I was expecting Mexican style street tacos which can be quite small.  I was wrong.  They were big.  We got the Tako (octupus), Al Pastor, and Korean (short rib).  All were good, but the Al Pastor was the stand out for me.  The pork was cooked perfect as was wonderfully seasoned.  The Korean and Octopus and a little too much sauce for my likely, as it overpowered some of the other flavors.  Service: Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable, though the service was on the slow side.  Tips: Make a reservation a few days in advanced if possible.  I called for a same day reservation for two on a Tuesday and they were booked solid.  Nice spot for a casual yet trendy date.  $20 corkage fee if you'd like to bring your own bottle of wine.  Overall: I will be back at some point to give them another try.  The food was solid and drinks were well made.  Lost a star for service and for temperature control.  I should have brought a coat.",

    "text": "Tako could be a five star rating with a bit more focus on execution of flavors.  The interiors are... stimulating.  I'll just leave it at that, because that's not always a good thing.  I do appreciate the use of the octopus graphics and it translating through to the light fixtures and door pull, but the lighting approach and some other features simply aren't successful.  I'm not here for a design jury, so I'll get to it.  The guacamole... so much potential with a variety of options for the build-your-own approach, ranging from traditional mexican ingredients to the inevitable asian inspiration drawn from the restaurant name.  This can go either way if people don't understand complimentary flavors, but on the bright side there are preset combos to ease their way in.  The cost is a bit high for the standard bowl before add-ins, particularly when considered next to the end product and what is most important... seasoning.  I thought I was going on the high side of flavor with the addition of chorizo, pickled habanero, queso fresco, and pepitas... the one item I wish I could have added as a write-in candidate was salt.  I understand most times the amount of salt on the accompanying chips is sufficient to compliment guacamole, but avocados can be a fickle mistress and lay flat on your tongue... unfortunately this was one of those times.  Also disappointing was that all of the aforementioned ingredients were mixed in prior to serving, destroying most of the desired texture contrast and layering of flavor.  This could have been much better, but was nothing to write home about or justify the price point.  The tacos, however, were significantly better on the whole.  Name a place (albeit indirectly) after your signature item and it better deliver.  The bistec was cooked and seasoned perfectly, having a great contrast between crisp char from the grill and a tender medium rare center.  Shishitos were enhanced with a quick blister by pan frying and provided a great compliment to the beef, with a bit of freshness added by way of the salsa roja and cilantro.  Like many great tacos, a dusting of queso fresco finished a relatively great bite.  The octopus, which can be very successful or a complete disaster from a texture standpoint depending on preparation, was borderline perfect.  A crispy charred exterior contrasted the tender and succulent cephalopod tentacle interior with the right amount of salt, laid over a slightly bitter bed of greens and a mellow harissa aioli.  The preserved lemon was more flavor forward than desired and provided more sweetness than expected... unfortunately this was not counterbalanced by the pickled onion.  If the sweetness were to be replaced by some serrano heat on this taco, it would be exceptional... but it was still a flavorful and well balanced combination.  Tecate was $4, as it should be.  No review necessary as they are almost required with tacos, regardless of their refinement level.  I will be back and bring others that haven't had the experience, I'll just make sure a reservation is made well in advance since it's always packed.  DeShantz is getting pretty good at this restaurant empire thing.",

    "text": "tako. Easily the best food experience I had while visiting Pittsburgh. When I saw the stellar reviews on Yelp, I immediately went to make reservations - only to find that there was nothing available until 10:30PM on both Friday and Saturday nights! Luckily, I was getting into the city late that Friday evening and could make the 10:30PM reservation work. I can only imagine what the wait is like without any!   When we arrived, the place had pretty much cleared out from the dinner rush. The outdoor bar area (where you can watch them make the tacos) was still full, but inside contained a few parties lingering from dinner over drinks or new couples being sat. We were given a table on the first floor and we settled down to order.  Starting with the trio of salsa + chips and the \"build your own\" guacamole, my boyfriend and I were in food heaven. The salsas all had a good mixture of spices and temperature, and the guacamole was the freshest it could be! It paired well with the salty chips and fruity margaritas we ordered.  For dinner, we both ordered a pair of tacos (the Chicken and Al Pastor) and they were AMAZING. The Al Pastor was marinated to perfection and I loved the grilled pineapple they put on top. Furthermore, their tortillas were on point - using a flour and lard mixture to make their own. They were light but still held the taco ingredients together well.   While dining at tako was a great experience - one I will definitely want to have again - I was let down by the prices and chips. The chips seemed to taste similar to what you could pick up at a grocery store, and with all the great, fresh food served there, I feel like their chip recipe (if homemade) could be better. Finally, the price - it just seemed a little high for the area and food tako serves. We ended up paying close to $100 for four drinks, two pairs of tacos, and two appetizers.",

I was very impressed with the sauces on both - strong, but not overpowering - and really allowing the meat to stand on its own.  But let's not ignore the awesome taco shell.  Not too soft, and it didn't tear while eating which really pushes this place to the 5th star.    We also both got the frozen eggnog - which is not likely in season anymore, but it was incredible.

    "text": "My mom and I made reservations for Tako before seeing a show across the street. The location is perfect! It's right near all the theaters and there are several landing garages nearby.   We made reservations through the Yelp app about a week prior and there were only 2 options left, 5 or 8. We chose 5pm and seemed to open the place for dinner. It was a great time to be there because it was not overly crowded. The tables and bar did fill up but we never felt like we had people on top of us!   The food was just awesome! We had the chopped salad and papas bravas (potatoes) for starters. It was the perfect portions for two of us to split, and we ended up even bringing some potatoes home. The salas was incredible! There were roasted chickpeas, walnuts, bacon, feta on romaine lettuce. The flavors were amazing! The potatoes were so crispy and yet soft in the middle, not greasy at all, just so much flavor! Definitely get it!!  I had a meal from the specials of the day, the BBQ quesadilla. It was such a huge portion! The pork just melted in my mouth! And the tortilla was so good, not just your average tortilla. It all tasted so authentic! My mom had the pollo taco. She loved it! It was slightly spicy but the sauce balanced it all out.   The decor was so cool! Very dark, which made it hard for my mom to see the menu, but after ordering it it was not a problem! My mom said it felt like we were inside the Moulin Rouge, ha!   I definitely want to go back and highly recommend it!",

We got there right when they opened at 5pm and sat at the bar since that area is open seating/first come, first served. We ordered one of the restaurant week specials which was a pretty good deal because we got to try a few dishes: street corn, ceviche, guac, the korean bbq taco, pork belly taco and some chips and tomatillo on the side. Everything was so good. The only thing I wasn't diggin was my drink - I ordered the Lychee & Pepper, since I'm a big fan of lychee. I could not taste the lychee at all. While the presentation of it was nice, the flavor was unexpected and a little off for me. 5 stars for the food, customer service and really nice ambience!",

    "text": "This is a review I dread writing. I LOVE so many things about tako but so many thing were BAD during our last visit.  This is our most up to date impression.   So upon past experiences, we tried to make a conscious effort to refrain from over ordering. As much as we love our dogs; we are trying to cut back on the literal doggie bags going home. (The vet hasn't been very impressed with our mini dachshunds recent weight gain, Thank goodness our other two are mastiff breeds) And don't worry, the dogs did end up with tako leftovers.   So, we decided to order one apps, drinks, & then tacos.  We have always loved the tacos & thought we would start with one order each and could always order more!   To begin with. The service was awkward. Upbeat and hip as one would expect from tako but items arrived without a flow that one would expect at tako. The chips took forever to arrive at our table. About a minute before our takos arrived. We had quite a long amount of time sipping on our artisanal drinks but they would have been much more enjoyable with the chips and house made salsas. Each salsa accompanying the chips were awesome. Three come with the chips. One mild, a medium, and a hot. Fresh ingredients mingling and hitting the tongue with not just heat but flavor & spice. It's amazing- Except when you really need a drink refill. And nobody returns to your table to offer another cocktail.   Water is available at the table, which is nice. Cocktail features being the star of the show at tako; it can be disappointing to settle on a glass of water when you really something like a hand pressed juiced drink to accompany the salty spiciness of their chips.  So the chips ended up being mostly abandoned and taken home in a literal doggie bag. Bummer.  This is why our small dog is fat.   As for the takos. I went with my favorite. Chicken. One of the tamer choices at tako. Typically the chicken takos are a beautiful mix of grilled chicken, avocado, salsa verde, cilantro, & onion but these ones weren't as warm as usual and just - eh. Still good but not what I was expecting. Again, a tako taco ended up going home for the dogs.   So. I still would suggest tako for a night out. It's good. The ambiance is almost too cool to function all the time. I can't say it's my favorite place. Which is disappointing because I was hoping for it to be THE MOST amazing place.  It's good. It's not my favorite at this point.  But it's fun and festive. Entertaining. My dogs really love their food!",

Think, reserve two months in advance.During the warm days, there are outdoor bar stools to sit at, and there is a bar inside.  I have one word for you: tacos.  Lovely, flavorful, happy taco-land.  We typically order from their main menu for dinner, however, their list of specials always sound delicious.  And don't forget their margaritas and beer selection.  If you are taking a date, the music is loud, so be prepared for that.  You also sit close to the people next to you.  Can't wait to go back again.",

    "text": "Truly superb tacos, guac (build your own) and Margaritas -- possibly the best I've ever had in all three categories. Even the house-made tortilla chips were extra crunchy & flavorful, without being at all greasy. The vibe here is very hip, and the service is attentive and helpful. Even the bathroom is cool.  I found myself at tako two nights in a row, and although I was warned that it would be very crowded, the turnover at the inside bar was fast enough that I only waited maybe ten minutes to get a seat. That's entirely reasonable IMHO. I tried the steak tacos (Bistec) and the grilled chicken/avocado tacos on the two successive nights. I suppose if I was super picky I might have said the beef was a bit too rare for my tastes (they don't ask you about cooking temp), but the flavor was amazing. I actually liked the chicken even better. This place knows how to inject a lot of meaty flavor into their grilled items. This is one thing that makes the tacos truly exceptional. Background music is downtempo, hip, EDM genre, which seems to fit with the decor and the clientele quite well. This is the best food I have eaten in Pittsburgh. Highly recommended.",

Without reservation, was able to get seated within 5 minutes on the Wednesday before New Year's Eve.  To wait for a few here is a treat, as they have a very unique setup where 3 walls of the kitchen are behind glass (facing inside the dining room/bar, the foyer, and the street) - always love places that expose the kitchen to the guests.  The newspaper menu is quite creative, seems to be a growing a trend which I'm a fan.  I also liked how simple it is, maybe 8 or so appetizers and about the same for the tacos with some daily specials for consideration.  Drinks were awesome, the oxaca old fashioned is small but packed punch and flavor, same for the Diablo margarita (bigger, 8-10 oz drink).  We started with a recommended guacamole which had tuna and some Asian flavoring which was delicious and portion matches the price.  Tacos were all good, however the house special octopus and the bistec were superior.  Only stumble was the last round of drinks came out slowly and did not seem to be a function of volume of people at the bar.  Minor blemish in and otherwise very good experience.  Pittsburgh price '$$' seem inconsistent to me, if it helps I got an app, 4 tacos and 5 drinks for ~$130.",

My partner and I did the sampler where we got 12 total tacos (6 for each, yes it was a lot for us) so we could try all of them. I think of the 6 we each tried we only somewhat enjoyed one of them. We got a Korean (the best one but it wasn't great either), grilled chicken (the worst of them), fish, shrimp, pastor, and octopus. Bottom line is none of them were anything to write home about and I'm so disappointed that everyone raves about this place. It makes me wonder if people have even had real Mexican tacos before, or at least tacos from LA or Texas. This place was huge let down.",

The drinks are phenomenal and I wish we had gotten more, but we were saving room for the tacos.  The reason why I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the gluten. On their website and as told to me by a friend, they say their menu can be gluten free. I told the waiter this, however, the waiter said that pretty much all of the tacos have gluten snuck in somewhere whether in the sauce or something else, but \"it's only a little bit.\" The tacos aren't big and and I don't have Celiac's (just an intolerance), but man, I felt the gluten. Great experience, but 1 time deal!",

    "text": "Start to finish, I was totally in love with my dinner at tako! We got here early on Valentine's day, around 5:30pm, and found seats at the bar right away. The cocktails and margs all sound amazing and wee decided on some unusual options - cilantro margarita and the daiquiri with squid ink. The margarita was so good and refreshing, with a little heat and not too much sugar. The daiquiri on the other hand was way too sweet for our tastes and the subtle oceany flavor of the squid ink was totally overpowered, so the ink was really just there to make the drink look edgy and black in color.   We got some chips and guac, which come in funky patterned wooden boxes. The amount of guac was ridiculously tiny for the price and the amount of chips provided, so I'd skip this appetizer in the future. However, do not miss the chips because they are to die for, probably the best I've ever had! So definitely make sure you order salsa or queso or something, so you get the opportunity to crunch on these beauties.   The tacos are obviously the star of the show here. The menu is heavy on seafood tacos, but I was initially upset there was only one vegetarian option (nothing vegan). After my first bite of the mushroom and sweet potato taco, though, I was so satisfied - the flavor was sooo good!! They really play up the meatiness of the mushrooms with savory and spicy chutneys and dressing. The sweet potato is very subtle and just adds some texture to balance out the chewiness. My partner tried the shrimp taco and raved about that as well.   The tacos are pretty large and filling, and a plate of two makes a hearty meal for most folks.",

If you are a tequila person this is your place as they have over 200 tequilas. I had the octopus tacos and my wife had the chicken tacos.  The octopus was delicious, tender and complimented by fennel and crispy chickpeas that added a wonderful pop of flavor and texture. The chicken tacos were unbelievable, I'm not sure how they prepare the chicken but it has a phenomenal grilled flavor going on while being nicely spiced, flavorful and tender. Hands down best tacos of my life so far. As some people have previously posted the place is very small and tables are close together however, this did not have any negative impact on our experience. We even had some friendly conversation with our neighbors. The only thing that was a little tricky was keeping an eye on the restroom when you needed to use it as there was just the one. Highly recommend this as a place for an exciting date for 2!",

    "text": "I've been wanting to go to taco since I moved to Pittsburgh three years ago, right around when they opened.  Whenever I've tried to make a reservation it's been very difficult to get in. I bought my has been tickets to the symphony about two months ago and made my reservation at the exact same time hoping that I could get a decent timeslot. With even two months prior to our dinner there was only a 5 o'clock time slot which I took.  I wish there were some type of notification on when they open up their booking so that I could book a better slot.  When we arrived we were sat immediately and the Waiter checked in with us about three minutes into sitting which was perfect so we could play straight quarters. I enjoyed an unbelievable coconut margarita. I had the wedge salad, which had dill on top. If the deal wasn't on there I would've loved it but it was very overpowering as it was fresh.  I ordered their signature octopus tacos which were absolutely delicious and their portion was spot on. The service overall was fantastic my biggest complaint was there was a member of the cooking staff on the phone with his girlfriend having a very heated conversation right next to our table. If I had been the manager of this restaurant I would not of allowed this to occur.   It really took away from our experience as this phone call lasted nearly 10 minutes.",

    "text": "I was finally able to eat at the place that most Pittsburghers call the best restaurant in the city! I was afraid it would not live up to the hype, but I'm so glad I was wrong! It really is delicious! Let me start with their Queso, it's really good, but eat it fast or it will solidify. Also, it looks like a bigger bowl than it is, so I'd say, don't share this dish with more than one person or y'all will end up fighting for bites haha! I tried the chicken, chorizo, the Korean, the octopus, the steak, and the shrimp tacos! What I really loved was that each one had their own unique flavor and character. The shrimp was probably my favorite and I think they used Cheetos in the batter, because you can really taste the cheddar goodness! One thing I will say is that if you are trying to eat healthy, avoid the Korean and Shrimp tacos because they are deep fried, but hey, that's what makes it delicious, and it's ok once in a while! I will say, this place is a little expensive for a taco joint, but it's far from that! If you're just looking for tacos, this isn't really that vibe. It's a fusion high end restaurant and when you think of it as such, then the prices are fairly reasonable. I will also say, you get only two tacos in an order, but HOLLY COW they are big! It's packed with meat...haha get it, holly cow...meat! They also had a live DJ there, which was dope! I didn't drink there, but I tasted some cocktails, and they were good! The service was also EXCELLENT and I really appreciate that! The only negative was that the waiter was unable to appropriately split our checks, so be prepared with a good calculator if you come with a big group! The waiter was still super nice and probably one of the best servers I've had in PGH!  Summary:  4.5/5 stars only because I was told it's the best tacos so I'm using taco joints as a benchmark! Also because the Queso bowl was small and we couldn't split our checks. This place is not a taco joint, it's far more than that! it's amazing, I can't wait to go back!  In summary, best tacos in Pittsburgh?! NO Best Restaurant in Pittsburgh?! Yes Best Service in Pittsburgh?! Yes",

The elote was fine, but their attempts to fancify it did not make it better then the kind you get on the street. The tacos were fine, but the meat was overcooked and tough. We came a little later in the evening, but this is no excuse.  Atmosphere: Great. Dark lighting, murals, chandeliers, and a heavy use of the colors black and red provide a cool atmosphere.  Service: Quick and efficient. We didn't have a reservation but they still quickly found us a table.  Value: the price for two tacos is very high. Couple that with them not being that amazing means that this place is not the best bang for your buck",

    "text": "I have have been wanting to try Tako out for a long time. We had tickets to Aladdin (awesome show) so I made reservations thru Yelp.  We arrived on a Wednesday night a 5:45... not too many people but when we left around 6:30 there was a line.  It's dark and trendy, we sat in the booth high chair combos when you came in.  The tables are close, but not too uncomfortable. Once you order the table fills up pretty quickly.   We ordered drinks: coconut marg and a spicy jalapeno marg. The coconut was a dream and I could have ordered 3 of them.  The spicy marg literally made my lip numb. It had a nice taste but was difficult to finish.  It has several slices of fresh jalapeno in it.  The street corn and 3 salsas were nice appetizers. The salsas were fresh and had great flavor, the chips were excellent.  The street corn was easy to cut off the cob (messy of course, but the waitress brought over napkins)  We ordered tacos (you get 2 per order)to share. We got the Korean and Chicken tacos.  I loved the chicken taco, it is made with chicken thighs so it was very flavorful and juicy.  The Korean Taco was too sweet- the meat was good, but the sauces were too much. My mom liked the Korean, but I did not. It all came out perfect and quickly. Our waitress checked on us enough to feel taken care of but not too much that it was annoying. We never needed to look for her she almost anticipated what we needed.  Excellent experience, can't wait to go back. I saw someone order the mondo platter. I'd love to do that with some friends!    ::Update:: went last night for my husbands 40th. Everything was perfect once again! We went with friends. I made reservations on Yelp, requested an upstairs booth just incase. We were seated quickly, our waiter was fantastic, personable, knowledgeable and timely.  Everyone loved their food.  My husband got the mushroom tacos. OMG- THE best taco. Layers of deep flavors. Friends got the pork shoulder and shrimp tacos. They loved them esp the shrimp. I had a bite, they were ok- would have preferred grill shrimp not battered.  The corn is now served in a bowl, very helpful and delicious!  Consistently delicious! The decor is fun and funky.",

    "text": "Never had tacos this good before. I'm a lover of Mexican food and as overrated as this place may sound it certainly lived up to its reputation and is totally worth it. To start out, I had a grapefruit mocktail (of two choices: grapefruit and coconut) and guacamole and chips, but of which were very good and highly recommended. I thought my friend and I would run out of chips but we had them to munch on till the very end. As pictured I got the pastor tacos and was genuinely surprised by the amount of meat I got, I had to eat a couple pieces with a fork to be able to eat the rest as a taco. Great balance of flavors with the cilantro and pineapples for some sweetness. My friend got the korean tacos which I was able to try and those were excellent as well. Unfortunately neither of us had the budget to get dessert but I'm sure it would've blown us away too. Service was great, manager walks around to ask how customers are enjoying their meals which is always pleasant.  Downside for me was that the interior of the place is very dark, hence the photo taken with flash. Overall, I highly recommend trying this place if you're in town and make sure to make a reservation in advance!",

We all came from DC and we do not really have anything like those delicious tacos from this place nearby our neighbor. Food was soooo amazing,  pineapple and peach sangria drink was super tasty. The atmosphere and the decorations was cool and chic. Unfortunately, for some reasons, the male server was being so rude and very lack of his hospitality services skill. Not sure if he had a bad day or something but it really ruined our dine in experience. Thumb down for the service  :(",

First staff is super friendly and specially the guys that are working in the open kitchen which you see from the street. It's just a cool place, atmosphere is great and vibe is just positive.   I wasn't hungry coming in but wanted to try just a minimum of food to be able to rate this place.  As an appatizer I got the papas bravas which were beyond delicious. Something so simple is hard to execute so well. Every bite was super crispy on the outside and super patato'ish on the inside. Just everything about it was perfect. After I had the shrimp tempura taco, nothing else to say than that it was simple but yet pure perfection. Just the perfect taco. I give this place a big 5 stars. Also price is correct. Big 5 stars, great place!!!!",

We arrived at 7:23pm and were told it would be a 30-45 min wait but that we're more than welcome to have a drink or two at the bar while we wait. Once we agreed, they took our phone number to let us know when our table would become available, and we decided to stand at the bar. At the bar, it took a bit of time before a bartender took our order despite handing us a menu the moment one of us sat down (there weren't enough chairs for the both of us). When we were finally ready to place our drink orders, we waved down a bartender to place our order. Shortly after this, two other customers arrived at the bar and got the attention of the same bartender who just took our order which prompted her to take their order and make their drinks before ours--despite placing ours first. We immediately finished our drinks and decided to walk to another restaurant which was a great thing that we did since we received an alert that our table was ready at 8:58pm--an hour and half after we put in our request.",

We showed up a couple minutes early and we're seated downstairs. It looks like all of the larger seating areas are upstairs and the bar is downstairs as well as all the two seater tables. I had already perused the menu before we got there so I was fairly sure I knew what I wanted. I started off with a pineapple margarita. Just a word to the wise there is definitely Jalapeno in that Margarita so be careful when you order it because you will be in for a very spicey surprise! It was very good though and I would definitely try a different flavor if I go back. The queso fundido was our appetizer which comes with for Fresh Tortillas. It was loaded with chorizo scallions and peppers and was a big hit. If you need more tortillas they charge you for $4, but we thought for for the two of us was plenty. Since I'm a huge fan of street corn I had to try it. It was amazing! We went with the Carnitas and Korean tacos for our entrees. We both thought the flavors were fantastic, and we rounded up the evening with an order of churros. They came four to an order with a side of chocolate sauce and also a passionfruit creme anglaise. Personally I thought they were Tad under done in the middle but they were still at a bowl so we just went with it. Overall the evening was good, probably not as good as we were expecting, but not somewhere that I would cross off of my to go list. The one thing that I have to complain about is how hot it was inside the restaurant, it was nearly unbearable. I'm not sure what the issue was, but with all that spicy food and the amount of heat that was in there it was way too hot. People were fanning themselves with their menus and even the workers were uncomfortable. No military discount here.",

The atmosphere is super laid back. The one wall has a huge octopus painted on it, it looks awesome. The vibe was on point! There is an upstairs but I didn't go up so I can't tell you much about that. Definitely a go to place for drinks or food! Make sure that if you're gonna go here on a weekend that you put in a reservation, if we had wanted a table we were gonna have to wait for over two hours. RESERVATIONS ARE A MUST! The bar is first come first serve, snag a seat the moment you can. Otherwise, I totally recommend Tako!",

As soon as I sat down at the bar, the bartenders were very attentive. I got a red sangria that was absolutely delicious. I asked the bartender if I should do ceviche or poke and he suggested poke so I did, and I was not disappointed. The chunks of fish were huge and the sweet ginger sauce was delicious. I got a flourless chocolate cake to go that I promised I would only eat half of and promptly ate the entire thing. If this spot was in my city, I know where I would be taking future dates. Great ambience!",

    "text": "After talking about going to tako for over a year, my friends and I made it out last month - and we only just made it, because even this long into their run this place was HOPPING. I couldn't get a reservation in advance and we were lucky enough that there was outdoor seating on a relatively mild November night. Otherwise, I wouldn't even be writing this review.  I admit, once we got our food we understood why this place was so freaking busy. I came with a group of four in total, and we ordered a variety of tacos and appetizers to split. Nothing disappointed. Everything that came to us was fresh, crisp, tangy...whatever word you'd expect each ingredient to be, that ingredient met expectations and then some. And the flavor combinations of everything resulted in delectable dishes all around.  We kicked off our meal with their tasty bravas and cocktails, all of which put us in a very good mood - the kind of good mood that the best food inspires. And when the tacos themselves arrived they did not last long at all. The baja fish tacos stand out in my mind as the tastiest item of the night, almost making me regret ordering my mushroom tacos for the night. Almost - the mushroom tacos here are not to be underestimated, as a well-cooked mushroom is a mighty force. I think someone actually tried and loved the octopus tacos, which I skipped entirely. That food is not for me. But based on the way vegetables and fish alike were prepared, no matter what they make these cooks know how to make it right.  We ended the night by ordering a round of drinks for the staff after work - yep, this is an option that you have added to your bill, so when you visit, budget accordingly so you can spoil the cooks. They really truly deserve it.  Needless to say, my gang loved this place - we loved how easy it was to share dishes, and we loved the fact that the dishes were so good that we had a hard time even sharing them. I definitely recommend coming here when the weather is nice and asking to sit outside - while waiting to grab seats I saw the interior of tako, and it was too dark and too loud for my taste. Maybe it's not usually like that? But if it is, I'd much rather eat here after rush hour. Tacos and cocktails on the sidewalk...sounds like a great night out to me!",

After the TWO bad experiences we had there we both agreed we won't be eating here anymore. The first thing that made us turn away from tako was, I had made reservations for a Thursday night at 6:00 two weeks before that day. We were going to the pirate game and wanted to eat a good meal before we arrive and the hosted says that they do not have our reservations, and that they really couldn't do anything for us so we decided to just eat some where else because we had to be at the game at 7. Since we didn't eat there Thursday we decided to go Tuesday the following week. We made reservations, we get seated our waitress came over and started off very nice. Then it started to rain, and we asked if we could sit inside. She said she was going to check. The host comes over and says he can't get us a table inside we say out side at our own risk. We had to pay for the guac we didn't eat. Horrible customer service.  And attitudes were just not ok",

Thinking that a Wednesday night would be easy to get a table, we didn't make reservations.  We were wrong - the place was packed.  Since the place looked cool, and was obviously jumping, We put our names in and had drinks next door.  We were glad we waited. We started with a tuna app, fried chicken tacos, and the queso fundido (with short ribs).  That queso was out of this world!  We also had a round of mango chile margaritas - a little zippy (which I love) and absolutely delicious! We then shared the Shishito, shrimp, Korean, and duck tacos.  All delicious!  The shishito was my favorite but I think I was just overloaded by goodness by the time I had a chance to try them all.  The Korean and duck tacos were very rich.   Overall, we enjoyed our visit and would come back again!",

    "text": "Tako is one of Pittsburgh's jewels hidden amongst the cultural district. Catering to a young, trendy crowd, the Asian-Mex twist restaurant seems to be more fitting of New York than the business district of Pittsburgh. Dimly lit and chattering with noise from its patrons and in-house DJ, it's clear to see that Tako is definitely the place to be on a Saturday night. This little blip of New York flash works well in Pittsburgh. Lines of people weave out the door and down the sidewalk on particularly busy nights, so if you don't necessarily need a table, do yourself a favor and snag yourself a seat at the bar. The drinks are deliciously different and pair perfectly with the food. The tacos themselves come two to a plate and are perfect to share. While their tacos are rather light, I'd highly recommend ordering one of their appetizers to start. Tako is an absolutely well-rounded dining experience, and you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "My first time at this restaurant. We arrived Sunday evening 15 minutes ahead of the reservation time and were promptly seated inside. The decor is sweet. The music and dim lighting aren't my thing, but nothing to complain about. We told the server that it was our first time here, scoured the menu, and ordered drinks/apps/tacos without fuss. Drinks arrived within 5 minutes--frozen margaritas--and were excellent. Things quickly ground to a halt after that.   Essentially, we waited 40 minutes for the first glimpse of food to show up--the famed Papa Bravas. Once it did, it looked and tasted like charcoal secondary to how burnt it was. I try not to exaggerate, but the potatoes were thoroughly black. Our server was polite and affable; he acknowledged that they were quite burnt, apologized, and offered to get us another quick appetizer as we waited for the entrees to come out. We took up his suggestion and got the #1 guacamole instead.   We munched on chips and guac for a while. Eventually the tacos arrived, approximately 1 hour after we showed up. The folks two tables down had been seated later than us, and by this point had already enjoyed their apps, drinks and tacos. I'd definitely recommend what we got, the octopus and grilled scallops. But it's hard to fully enjoy food when you're feeling antsy and overlooked. We scarfed these down and requested the check. They kindly comped us for the burnt Papa Bravas, and charged for the guac instead. Thanks, I guess...?   I never fully realized how important timing was to a good food experience. Beyond that, I suppose I was tremendously surprised that someone had prepared one of the restaurant's most popular dishes, saw how burnt it looked, and decided to plate and serve it anyway.  It'll be hard to find a reason to come back. With all the excellent reviews of tako on Yelp, our ho hum experience won't make or break this already-thriving restaurant. I can only suggest for the future that like in any effective relationship, more open and honest communication may be helpful to change the course and mood of a dining experience gone sour.",

    "text": "So this past Saturday night, we were walking back from a game at PNC Park, the foot traffic along this stretch was heavy. Well what grabbed our attention first, was the outdoor counter seating. Then it was Tacos, in Pittsburgh. So we weighed the dining options and settled on here. Or so I thought. Went inside and it was packed, fine its Saturday night, that made sense. The weather wasn't the best outside, but that wasn't stopping the craving for tacos. So we said we'd eat outside and the hostess made it clear in a rather rude tone that ther was \"a list.\" That's great, how long is the wait was the next question, then rudely answered with \"there's a list for outside.\" I turned around walked out, I wasn't gonna express the first thought that came to mind. So I go out and see that seats had corned up. The other person with me came and said that they wouldn't even offer to put us down on this \"list.\"   So we stood there for a few minutes. It's odd, if this so called \"list\" existed, where was it's lucky winners for sitting outside in the crappy weather?   You can save your time on overpriced tacos. Street tacos shouldn't cost that much. And if you're not some trendy hipster who's not even trying, chances are you're getting a rude response from a hostess in need of an attitude adjustment. There are better options in that whole area.",

Called for reservations for his birthday, when I wanted to add two more people to the party, I was told that I couldn't because seats fill up too fast. When I explained that it was his birthday, the lady could care less. Her response was \"well at 945 at night we can seat that many people.\" My reservation is for 515. Completely ruined his birthday. And it's completely ridiculous. After this- will never return. My money and time is clearly more appreciated elsewhere.",

The downside is that a reservation must be made in order to secure a table. I arrived on two different occasions without a reservation and was told that I didn't need a reservation when I call to place a reservation. This quite naturally irritated me because I wanted to sit outside and was told there was a wait I was told that I can sit at a table but I can only sit there for an hour. I came with my pregnant best friend and I certainly didn't want her to feel rushed while we were eating. I enjoy the environment but just not so much of the extraness. It kind of irked me that it's a small restaurant with a big city feel however is not accommodating. Just my personal opinion.",

I love the octopus arm light fixtures, the bar area is amazing looking, and even the bathroom was cute! The upstairs has a little balcony space with really neat lighting... Almost looks like an old theater or something. I cannot say enough how much I loved the inside. I had a margarita, which was delicious. We shared the thrice fried wings, and man were they AMAZING!! They even gave us hot towels for our hands after eating them. My husband and I split the fish tacos and the Korean tacos... They were absolutely perfect. Those guys have their flavors on point...phew... They were sooo crazy good. Okay, now that I've told you how great this place is about a hundred times... Get your ass over there!

The drinks are interesting, the ambiance is fun, the service is great, and the food is all prepared excellently however the only drawback in my opinion is that the tacos here all try to be a bit too exotic and miss the mark a little bit flavor-wise.  I've eaten here several times now and all of the appetizers I've had, including the build your own guacamole, have been absolutely delicious.  It's worth coming here just for the queso appetizer alone.  It's also amazing to get a hot, moist towel to clean your hands with after the wing appetizer, every restaurant needs to do this.  As mentioned above, the tacos are all cooked well, but after having sampled nearly every variety on the menu none of the flavor combinations quite 'click' for me even when I think they should based on the menu description.  The tacos are all tasty and I'll keep coming back for more, but I haven't had the 'that taco was amazing' moment yet.",

A tip if you don't have a reservation, if you arrive a few minutes before opening and wait in line, you can almost always get a seat at the bar and the bartenders are awesome. The food is fantastic. I'm in love with the street corn. The description sounds a little scary (mayo in corn?!?) but it is delicious.  We are also fans of their queso fundido. Super creamy, just the right amount of spice, and the warm tortillas are awesome. We could easily have made a meal of just the corn and queso.  The tacos are fantastic as well, we've tried carnitas, pollo asado, and baja and all have been fantastic. They also run specials that change nightly. The vibe here is dark and a little loud. It can be a bit difficult to see your feed or talk to your dining companions, not somewhere I would go for s romantic night out. But the music is normally awesome, and they have a few seats outside if you want to check those out.",

    "text": "So I saw this on Cheap Eats and started to feel more then insulted, this crazed ultra-sympathetic West-Indian guy runs around and puts holy praise on all the cliche-modern restaurants that are very over-priced and are setting an unfairly high bar on the food industries pricing, sure it looks like it tastes good, but you get two small carnitas-style  - chorizo tacos with a simple fried egg and even simpler cilantro on top for $12.00 that's $6.00 each!!! outlandish! do you expect to turn a high profit margin based on the quality of your ingredients and greediness? Dude I can make these @ home for less then half the price! WHY? is everyone so stupid and why do they buy this? is it to Live to Eat, or to Eat to live? we need to go back to Eat to live, you waspy-elitest types suck.",

    "text": "We ate here for the first time after hearing several positive reviews about the food.  The chef's special guacamole with bacon and duck confit was excellent.  We also tried the chips and salsa and the queso fundido, both of which were respectable.  We tried several of the tacos, including the Tako, Korean, carnitas, chorizo and Baja.  Standouts included the Korean taco and the carnitas taco.  The Tako taco was not as flavorful as we had hoped.  We enjoyed the well-crafted cocktails and highly recommend the spicy cucumber margarita.  Multiple other reviewers have commented about the service and - unfortunately - we had the same lackluster experience.  Our server, Michael, was terse to the point of being unfriendly in addition to being inattentive.  Were the food and drink good?  Absolutely!  Do we have several other options for good food and drink in restaurants that also emphasize the importance of quality service?  Yes, to that too.  Because of the poor service, we would probably not go out of our way to return to Tako.",

    "text": "My father and I ate at Tako on Friday night around 10 PM. We just got into Pittsburgh after a long 12 hour Amtrak journey from Boston and decided to grab something to eat near our hotel. We came upon Tako and were instantly intrigued by the outdoor seating that looked into the kitchen. We waited outside for a few minutes then realized you are supposed to go in and put your name on the waiting list. We spoke to the hostess, who was very nice,and she seated us immediately at the outside counter.   Damien, our waiter, was awesome from the get go. He recommend the Tako taco (grilled octopus) as well as a guacamole blend and a few drinks. In addition to the tako I ordered the Korean taco. The Oaxaca Old fashion was a great Mexican spin on a traditional old fashion and Damien gave us a little background history about how that drink tied into the whiskey rebellion. The tuna guacamole was the perfect fusion of Japanese and Mexican flavors. The umami flavors really came through and they were not scant on the amount of the fish they included in it.   The entrees were also delicious. I highly recommend the grilled octopus taco. The fresh lemon juice and the peanut sauce made for a refreshing and savory coalescence of flavors. The octopus was very tender and the portions were generous. The Korean taco had a good amount of spice it blended the flavors very well. For dessert we had the whipped cheese cake, which was a modern deconstructed version a traditional cheese cake. It spiraled up around a center of blueberries blackberries and raspberries. They topped it off with a creamy vanilla ice cream that stole the show. All of Damien's recommendations were successes. This restaurant is a must for anyone in the area-great food and staff.",

    "text": "One of the greatest challenges to a restaurant that's \"hot\" is to justify it's heat (I sound like the critic in Ratatoullie but without the charm).  Tako really does justify.  Now, first things first...why is it seemingly uncouth in these types of establishments to be well lit?  Are the wait staff hiding horrible acne which may lead patrons to believe that they could very well leak open face wounds onto their dishes?  I can't see anything!!!  Fortunately, I basically knew what I wanted before I went out there.  But yeah, attention restaurants...electricity is relatively inexpensive, add some lights.  I heard that this place was extremely noisy.  It is pretty noisy...but it's not that bad.  Their may be an illusion of noise because the tables on the bottom floor are longer, and therefore you are further away from anyone you would be eating with (what percentage of people have anything interesting to say, really?).  We ordered the mushroom, Tako (octopus), and baja (fish) tacos, along with the lamb quesadilla.  All items came out at the same time (thus justifying the previously mentioned long tacos).  Visually, they were Liv Tyler (remember her?).  That is to say, they were perfect looking.  But looks can be deceiving...in this case, they weren't.  They were awesome.  Here's a subtle compliment, the texture was perfect.  Especially with the tako...they perfectly blended chewy and crunchy with the ingredients...and the octopus was cooked perfectly (for those of you who are octopus shy, it was the consistency of a juicy porkchop).  Delicious.  But surprisingly, this probably wasn't the best.  The best was the little taco that could, the mushroom taco.  I am not even close to a vegetarian, but if all vegetarian fare was that good, I'd be more willing to switch teams than a drunk freshman girl at her sorority initiation (yucky...puns).    Like I said, I can't really complain about the food itself...the restaurant is hip enough...but then again, I was Mr. Magoo in the dark (how's that for an antiquated reference?), so maybe everything looked awful.  Oh, and from what I could tell, they only had one unisex bathroom which pretty much always had someone waiting.  I wasn't aware of codes, but you would think that a restaurant would require more than one toilet (this point is moot if I just missed it).  IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND:  Rush:  Technically precise, with a hardcore fan base who believes them to be an all-time great.",

However, at midnight (we couldn't order food in between times?) we order \"late night tacos\".....they were awful. Slightly better than taco bell, but only slightly. I realize this is more for the bar crowd and shouldn't have expected much, but I did expect to arrive at 11:40 and order some guac....nope!

I would have never thought of that combination, but that bittersweet grapefruit, together with the whiff of savory sage was excellent.

    "text": "Tako was on my foodie lists for months and a friend and I finally had time for dinner there last week. We had an 8:45 reservation and we arrived around 8pm so we started with a drink at the sister restaurant, Butcher and the Rye. To our delight, we were seated within ten minutes! The place was packed but the table space was ample. We were greeted by our very friendly waitress and she gave us the drink menu, food menu and separate MTO gauc menu. SHUT THE FRONT DOOR!! MTO Gauc?! Dreams do come True. They have a menu dedicated to creating the perfect bowl of gaucemole. Needless to say, I couldn't wait to place my order dive in. In total, we ordered Papa Bravas, gauc with pickled habanero pepper, onion, corn, and pepitas, and one of their specials- roasted butternut squash tostada with pistachio butter, feta cheese, cilantro and roasted veggies. For drinks, we ordered the daily frozen feature of the merlot marg and their strawberry yuzu.   The drinks were fantastic. Fresh & smooth with just enough of a kick.  Our gauc and papa bravas arrived first. I'm happy to report that despite my extreme excitement for the gauc, I took time to savor each bite so that I could give the Yelping world a fair review...so, here it is: Excellent gauc!!! Seriously, 5 star creation. Unfortunately, the gauc was paired with awful chips. I don't use the word awful lightly. These chips were a huge disappointment. They tasted like Tostito chips that were tossed in a warming pan for too long. Processed, non-authentic corn chips, WOMP :( I expected more out of Tako!! The chips didn't ruin the experience but they certainly knocked my review from a 5 to a 4. Alright, on to the next... Papa Bravas: sweet gracious, I am going to dream of these scrumptious taters. The crunch of the fried potato combined with the spicy tomato sauce offset by the garlic aioli- I am salivating while typing this- The oregano butter didn't pull through for me but that's okay, this dish was amazing.  Finally, our butternut squash tostada arrived. I didn't realize it came with feta but it was my fault for not asking. I'm sure it tasted good with the cheese but I picked mine off since I am not a dairy fan. Regardless of that ingredient being removed, the dish was great but not perfect. The pistachio butter was my favorite part, I almost licked the bottom of the plate (don't judge) The butternut squash was a bit too crunchy and under cooked but the rest of the veggies were bursting with flavor and the combination of it all made for an delicious and filling end to our meal. We wanted to try the tacos but we were bursting at the seams! The portion sizes of everything were larger than I expected, definitely worth the cost.   The service was well executed the whole night and overall, I am very pleased. I am looking forward to going back to try the tacos and more of the drink menu!",

They had a DJ on the Friday night that we were there, and it felt like that place should've been turned into a fancy club after dinner hours! It is a bit loud for conversations, but we didn't mind that!  The tako tacos are a must try - I've never had octopus so tender before, and the combination of flavors was just divine! We also had the Korean and Baja tacos. Both excellent - impressive combinations of flavors. One thing to note - the wagyu on the Korean tacos are deep fried. It was excellent, but I would like to try something grilled in the future as the Baja fish was also deep fried.   We ordered the Korean buns to start, but this did not agree with our tastes. Stick with the tacos and you'll have an amazing dinner.  The cocktails are amazingly crafted, well worth the $10 price for quality. We had the frozen pumpkin margarita and spicy passion fruit margarita, both excellent!!  I have already made my next reservation seeing as they're booked a month in advance, but I cannot wait to go back for more tacos!",

However, we were met with attempts at innovation that just fell a bit short. We started with drinks, but my boyfriend's first two choices were unavailable (we were eating at like 530). We had a few tacos, including the Korean, the carnitas and the duck confit. They were all pretty messy (the tortillas fell apart immediately) and we were just generally nonplussed by the food. It was also super dark inside which was a little uncomfortable. I think that I would have liked to just walk up and eat at the window bar as the food and drink situation would have met that expectation.",

Enjoyed it so much, we decided to return w the whole family for my son's birthday. I was pretty disappointed since I'd raved so much about it. Tacos were good, not great, and definitely not bursting at the seams like last time. Something was just off. Even the flavors that I'd remembered so well weren't there. My daughter had the Pastor last time- loved it- repeated this time and said it didn't taste anything like the first time :( We were on the balcony. Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, just way too absent. We had to ask a couple of times for water refills, food took a little longer than expected to arrive (~45'ish min), and I think he only checked on us once after the food came.  Overall, I probably won't be back anytime soon. Nothing awful, just too many places downtown to eat these days to spend money on a mediocre dinner.",

The guacamole is good, though I'm not a fan of putting tons of stuff like pork belly and all kinds of add one to mine, with guacamole I'm more of a purest, but whatever floats your boat. The tacos are very good, the bistec and the octopus are my favorites, but you really can't go wrong. I would give 5 stars if it wasn't so hard to get a decent seat on a regular basis and the meal can be a bit expensive for whst is basically tacos, and since opening they raised the taco prices, which I understand to a point but $20 for 2 steak tacos I think is a bit much.

Combined with salted housemade chips (which were delicious, great texture), I felt that I was eating a mush of salt.  -Carnitas taco: meat texture was phenomenal, very tender but overall was very heavy. From my previous experience I remember this to be lighter, perhaps they would benefit from something acidic such as a lime, but their chef(s) are the ones in charge.  -Bistec: again meat texture was great but I personally felt that the taco as a whole would have benefited from something to balance out the heaviness.   Choco taco: thick waffle taco with cookies/cream filling, smothered in some kind of cherry compote and banana chips. Overall a great concept and beautifully plated. However, waffle to ice cream ratio was too small because I too frequently was trying to find something to pair with the waffle (they do provide a huge jug of water!). Lastly, I did not find that the banana chips added to the dessert. Perhaps something citrus to go better with cherries...idk I'm not a qualified chef...let's not be too picky here!",

Seats are close but our spot seemed private enough since there is loud music which drowns out neighboring conversations.  We each got a margarita. My wife got the grapefruit which was OK to her. I got the spicy pineapple and really enjoyed it. Enough so that I got a second and my wife got one too. We got the street corn and tuna taquitos for apps. Both were fantastic. I got the chicken tacos that were very good. My wife got the Korean tacos. She liked them but will try something else next time. She also could only eat one as she was too full. The tacos are huge.

Flavors were on point and the tortilla was fantastic! It's kind of a bummer that you can't mix and match tacos, but that problem can be solved by going with someone who likes to swap/share.   I love the atmosphere. It's loud and lively and dark and a little steam-punkish (check out the bike gear chandelier- it's amazing!) Our server was really great and was able to give some helpful drink recommendations based off of preferences.   This would have been a five star experience if it weren't for dessert. Let me preface by saying that I will eat almost anything that contains sugar. I have a sweet tooth that rivals an elementary school student. But the dessert was... just not good. I couldn't even get half way through it. I ordered the whipped cheesecake with bananas foster and brownie brittle topping. \"Whipped cheesecake\" essentially equates to taking all the ingredients of a cheesecake, minus the crust, and putting it in a blender. It was rich (too rich) and creamy but the temp and texture just made it feel like I was eating sweet cream cheese that was sitting out too long. The bananas were good but just added more mush on top of mush. The brownie bits couldn't even save it.   Next time, I'll pass on dessert and just do drinks and tacos!",

    "text": "I honestly have to say that I never really was a huge fan of tacos. I have had them if friends ordered them, but I never really had a craving for it. Until now. Tako serves the best tacos in town for sure. I had a couple of different ones to try so far and I loved all of them. All of them have a unique combination of flavors with my favorite being the \"tako taco\". The octopus is grilled to perfection and is accompanied with a zingy sauce and greens. The amount of octopus you get for $18 is very reasonable! However, the only thing that did disappoint was the guacamole that everyone was raving about! We took the classic one and for my taste there wasn't enough lime and cilantro in it and was rather bland and to charge $11 for it, is a bit of an overkill.   Their margaritas however are really good, and so are their desserts. I also do love the the place itself (dark, fun and cozy) and most of the staff is really friendly and if you're ever picking up food you can watch the chefs preparing it. It can be quite hard to reserve a spot at this place so be prepared to wait a couple of weeks if you're a bigger group. I was usually quite lucky walking in on a Sunday afternoon without having to wait! Definitely one of my top 10 places to eat here. I'd give them 4.5 stars.",

    "text": "tako is considered to be one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh and it's for a reason. Both times I've eaten there it has exceeded my expectations.  tako is an upscale eatery in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh that brings SoCal Mexican food with deluxe ingredients. They have fantastic cocktails, a great venue, and unique tacos.  The drinks: tako has a great selection of margaritas that pair perfectly with their tacos and appetizers like Queso Fundido (a creamy queso made with shishito, chorizo, scallions, cilantro). I recommend the Oaxaca  and Grapefruit margaritas, although the Classic is solid as well.  Both their guac and Queso Fundido are great starters, but the focal point of the menu are their selection of tacos. Ranging from their tangy Korean Short Rib to the savory Chorizo to their legendary Octopus. They have a variety of tacos that all seem to hit the mark with fresh flavors and unique ingredients that add new twists on classic tacos. The standout is the obviously unique octopus taco. It delivers meaty but tender grilled octopus with small accoutrements that bring out the delicious flavor of the octopus. It's a must get if you visit.  All in all the perfect place to spend a Friday evening. Try to get a spot at the small outside bar. You sit next to the kitchen and get to watch the whole process, definitely a great atmosphere. It's not cheap, but it's not ridiculously priced either and for the food you get it's worth every penny  TLDR: Delicious upscale taco place in the middle of downtown. Grab a Oaxaca margarita if you like mezcal, if not go for the grapefruit. Tacos are the focus, they're all tasty but at least get the octopus as it's in a class of its own.",

I added their homemade Arbol sauce which has a sweet and spicy flavor. I was worried that the goat cheese would be overpowering, but the tacos were delicious! I'll definitely return to try them again before the menu changes. I ordered the cilantro cocktail to start and I would definitely recommend it. It wasn't too sweet if you're not into that. This is the third time I've been to tako and this I definitely made the best taco choice.",

    "text": "Tako is a trendy restaurant with a lovely ambiance. Think dimly lit space with a fully stocked bar that runs across the length of the restaurant. It's a bit hidden as they do not have any door sign, but you know you're there when you see the large doormat with letters adorning the restaurant's name. You'll know you're at the right place when you enter and see the glass which reveals the huge open kitchen to your right.   The guacamole here is a must. How many places do you go to that let you customize your own guacamole?! There's so many options to choose from such as pineapple, jicama, mango, bacon, crabmeat, smoked salmon - there's really no way that you can wrong!  Now on to the tacos. Tako really knows how to make a mean taco. We ordered the following:  - Al pastor (pork shoulder) with pineapple, onion, avocado salsa and cilantro - Korean short rib with fermented cucumber, napa cabbage, peanuts and cilantro - Blackened fish with onions, peppers, avocado crema, and cilantro   My favorite by far was the korean short ribs taco. The short ribs were perfectly seasoned and the cucumbers helped to cut the grease from the meat. And of course the peanuts added a nice crunch to it. The blackened fish, which was one of the specials of the night, was a close runner up. All tacos come in two per order.   One of my faves in Pittsburgh! I'm already planning another trip back here!",

With a small group I don't recall if we had reservations (I feel like we did), we waited for a while in basically the way of everyone. Hugging the walls to make room for other guests and service persons. I believe there were six of us and we would not sacrifice a bad table for quick seating.  I remember ordering the chorizo sausage with fried egg on top, boy this was my favorite. The flavor was perfect and the egg was cooked perfectly making for a messy but absolutely delicious taco.  I had some decent red wine and the selection was satisfactory.  The noise level was a bit high for a large group wanting to be heard by all at the table. A small four person party would be my strong suggestion.  We were seated in the upstairs loft where the heat (I was dressed for our Pgh winters), the wine, or the combination got to me. I had to remove a couple layers.   While I was up there I got to get a good look at the metal work that was done on the chandeliers. They look awesome. I got lost in the detail for minutes at a time.   I will return...",

I had the carnitas tacos which blew me away. My girlfriend had the chicken tacos and she as well said they were absolutely amazing. It took us forever to try Tako and it was 100% worth it. Now I do have one thing I need to get off my chest...... The music...... I mean I love me some Calvin Harris but every single song was Calvin Harris and the playlist looped. Is there a reason why this was? I'm very curious and we laughed about it all night. Thanks again!",

I came here for lunch on a Tuesday night. This place was packed, I luckily was able to snag a seat at the outside bar area.  I wasn't sure how many tacos to get, so I settled on just two making sure I made room for the tres leches at the end. I ordered the Pastor, but then later decided that might not be enough and ordered a Street Corn. The Pastor came absolutely stuffed with pork shoulder, I could barely close it. The typical pineapple accompaniment of the Pastor taco is supposed to balance out the saltiness, but I found the taco a little too salty for my taste. The Street Corn was the same story. The first few bite were good, but as I went back for more the saltiness just kept building.  The tres leches was probably my favorite part of the meal. I enjoyed the caramelized pear with the crema that helped cut some of the sweetness from the pear, cake, and caramel sauce.  Wouldn't mind coming back to check out the other items on the menu. I do wish that each order of tacos came in one instead of two. This would allow me to try out more taco options.",

Severely underestimated its popularity and thought I could walk in but I ended up having to make a reservation 2 weeks in advance for a Wednesday dinner.   The street corn, fish taco and tako taco (octopus) were all delicious. The best part was the octopus taco as the amount of meat was fairly large and the tentacles were tender yet crispy on the outside. It was served with harissa aioli, baby lettuce, pico de gallo, fennel, grapefruit - all these flavors melded together nicely and while it was filling, it felt light/balanced. The coconut margarita here was good as well.  The waitstaff here were attentive and our waters were always full. Why not 5 stars? Having had delicious tacos around the country that were on par with Tako, I felt that it was a little expensive for certain menu items such as the $22 octopus taco or $18 mushroom taco since it only comes with two per order.",

Came here for my boyfriend's birthday and we immediately took a liking to the hip ambiance this place has. We also had great service and really liked our waiter. Everything about this place was great - except for the food.  I think if you are able to disassociate what a taco usually tastes like, you may enjoy this place more than us. We ordered two appetizers - crab nachos and the elote. We both enjoyed the corn although we thought the portion was a little small. On the other hand, the crab nachos is very sizeable and can be shared among many people. We found there wasn't that much crab in this dish though.  In terms of tacos, we tried the Korean, octopus, al pastor, and steak. Heads up that all of the tacos are flour tortilla and not corn.   Korean taco - not sure what about this taco is Korean. It has green onions and peanuts (not a usual Korean ingredient). This in addition to the flour tortilla actually kind of reminded me of a chinese Peking duck spring roll? I didn't really enjoy the flavors here but it wasn't bad.   Octopus taco - I did not enjoy this and couldn't finish it. The octopus itself did not taste very good to me and didn't seem very fresh.   Al pastor taco - this taco had my favorite flavor except that it was very salty. Other than that, I really enjoyed it.  Steak taco - this was just ok. Nothing jumped out at me and I felt like it was a little boring.  We also got a white and red sangria. They were both really good and I especially enjoyed the white which was very peachy. The portions are very small though and the alcoholic content is not strong at all. It really just tastes like you're drinking good juice.",

We have never been here and there is a clear reason this place is rated so well. It is phenomenal!! You definitely should make a reservation and it's super easy. Do it right from Yelp! Do it now!  The place is on the small side, but the big flavor in their food takes over anyway. Our waitress was very personable and described all the dishes in such a way, that we wanted to try every single taco. We started with a pork belly special that they had that night (wish I could remember the name) and their street corn. I highly recommend both!  When we ordered, we assumed, like most other taco places, they give you small tacos with big price tags. NOT here! We shared three tacos (barely fit on our table); the korean (can be spicy), the octopus, and the al pastor. The octopus was absolutely phenomenal and all three were so full of flavor. They were super filling and a perfect amount for two hungry people.  Even though we were stuffed, we couldn't not get dessert (am I right or am I right???) We ended with the churros.  melted in your mouth and the perfect amount of sweetness. I didn't try any of the sauces, but my boyfriend thought the fruity sauce was surprisingly good.  So now go and set up a reservation!",

We each ordered one type of taco as well as they come two to an order.  I went with the shrimp tempura and my husband went with the Korean - both were very delicious and the Korean was a unique twist and the flavors were incredible!  You may be asking so why only 4 stars?!       Well I'm glad you asked! There were a couple items I couldn't overlook: our service was pretty good overall BUT.... I ordered a seltzer water with lime and my lime never came with my drink (no biggie right?) so when I asked my waitress about it the next time we saw her, she literally handed me one slice of lime FROM HER FINGERS a moment later! What?! And as great as the food was - our chips with our guac tasted like the oil they were fried in was bad or desperately needed to be changed.  So, not to be overly critical but it's the little things that count and for a restaurant as highly sought after as Tako I expected a little better in those areas.   Enjoy!",

Overall, great atmosphere and meal. Would go back again!",

It feels like you're eating in a nightclub which is an interesting dining experience. This place is in high demand, so definitely make reservations if you want a table.   I would recommend starting with the Queso Fundido -- it is amazing! The cheese is cooked in a small skillet topped with spicy chorizo and charred peppers and served with fresh tortillas. There is absolutely nothing better!   The tacos are incredibly delicious and creative. The Pastor is always a good choice and a classic, made with pork shoulder and topped with pineapple. But I would also recommend trying the Korean, which is a bit salty, though very flavorful. The tacos are balanced with the perfect ratio of toppings to meat.  They're large tacos, too! If you want to try two different options, order two different tacos (2 per order), and swap--otherwise, come hungry!",

The first sensation that hit when you bit into it is crunch! The meat is dry but in the best of way - it had soaked all the sauce, leaving a crispy outer layer so that each bite is an ocean of smoky flavor that eased into a sweet asian flavor that is so familiar yet unraveled in such a unique way.  The guacamole was fresh, wings are as crispy and tangy as the korean taco, cocktails were flavorful and innovative. We were so full but we had to try the okonomiyaki - I was not disappointed. It was such a unique take on okonomiyaki. The dough is flat and crisp, the toppings were layers of flavor, different and new yet at its core still very much an okonomiyaki.  Stumbling into Pittsburgh on this roadtrip, I was not expecting such a treat. However tako have definitely snagged a spot in my stomach's hall of fame.",

We started off with the guacamole which was the best I have had, so fresh and a nice touch of heat with small rings of Serrano peppers if you choose to dare. To drink she ordered a regular margarita which she seemed to enjoy and I order a tecate which I always enjoy. For the tacos I got the Korean and it was on point, the steak had a sweet and salty flavor with a kick of heat at the end and the slaw on top gave it a good cool and crunchy texture. My wife got the chicken tacos and she loved them. Definitely a must go to when you are in Pittsburgh.",

To drink, I had the red sangria and frozen strawberry margarita, both tasted great. Appetizer choice was my favorite, the crab queso chips! For dinner I had one Korean short rib taco and one tempura shrimp taco. My best advice if you are dining with another person is to each split a taco since your meal comes with two of the same! Highlight of the night was definitely the Korean short rib taco. The meat was so tender and it had a kick of spice!   Overall, the atmosphere at Tako is very intimate. The space is perfect for a date or smaller parties. The waiting staff are very friendly and helped with dinner choices. Make sure to book a reservation in advance to eat here or you will be waiting hours for a table! I'm excited to go back!!",

I did notice that prices increased from my last visit. I got the spicy pineapple margarita to start along with chips and guacamole. The guacamole was good but just unfortunately too many jalapenos. As for tacos my friend and I split - we got an order of the shrimp and fish (mahi mahi). I preferred the shrimp - it was tempura. I ended up getting the coconut margarita which was okay not my fave. All in all it was a good meal albeit a bit pricey I felt for Pittsburgh.",

It was notoriously stated that this was an 'experience' and had some of the best tacos in the city, and a large variety of different ingredients. I'm not sure how True those were.  We made a reservation before coming (which I highly recommend because it was PACKED) and were sat near the door. Thankfully it was a warm night out so it wasn't really a problem with people coming in and out.   Our server was very attentive and helpful while we made our selections. We ordered the Mexican Street Corn, which was AMAZING, and each ordered 2 tacos and 2 margaritas. I did like that the drinks were fairly strong.  However, for the price of the tacos, I was not wild about how they tasted. I feel that the quality and quantity of what we got was not worth the price. Now don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, it was just unsurprising after all that I had heard.   Not sure I would come back to spend that kind of money when Condado is right down the street..",

It was very entertaining to see all the moving pieces in the creation of their dishes. Plus, they play some damn good music. It went so well with the nice, not too hot not too cold, summer weather and the upbeat vibe of the restaurant.   We went to get the jalapeno margaritas, which my friend told me was a must try. It was good, I must admit because I've given up on margaritas. They're just too sweet for me. However, the jalapeno margarita was a nice balance. It wasn't sweet and it didn't taste like they used a mix. The jalapeno provided a slight heat but it was far from hot. One of the salsas we got was spicier than the drink. It worked out well in the cocktail. They aren't shy with the alcohol either but the drink didn't taste too strong. Everything balanced out well. Must try!   We ordered chips and salsa trio and the burrata. The salsas were fresh and so were the chips. The chips weren't overly salty either, which I like because I stay away from salty foods. The burrata was okay, not the best I've had but okay. It didn't have anything that gave me a lot of flavor. The heirloom tomatoes were freshly cut and delicious but it tasted like the dish was missing something.   I didn't try the tacos but I will saw, Tako has some of the best dish presentation I've ever seen. Their chefs take pride in their dishes and how it's presented to the customers and I could tell the whole time we were sitting there. It didn't even matter how busy they were (and they were busy), they freshly prepared each dish. They took their time and everything moved so fast even with the chefs being perfectionist about their plating.   Cute place for a drink. If I go back, I'll try a taco.",

The outdoor bar seats right at the kitchen counter are absolutely the way to go, and well worth the wait to nab.    So, tacos.  I mean, they have other food...  But, tacos.  For gluten-sensitive peeps, they are more than willing to sub out a corn tortilla for flour if you request it/let them know you're gluten-free.  The only taco that's permanently gluten-y is the (breaded) fish taco.  Bummer, but so many other delicious choices, like the mushroom taco.  So yum.  Meaty, perfect, maitake shrooms with a garlic aioli, truffle huitlacoche salsa, and brussel sprout salad.  It makes my mouth so happy.    Also, the guac is really, really good.  It's fresh, and quality, and thick, and they do this thing where you choose your funky add-ins that make it even more awesome.  Don't be afraid to try that weird combo!  You know you wanna!    Aaand the gin fizz was pretty cool.  I loved the addition of avocado and rose water, and making it with Jarritos was a good choice as well.",

Tako does it right in all ways in my opinion- service, food, ambience, location...but like most people have already written it's almost always crammed with people.  What can we expect when you have a smallish restaurant with all the goods?    A friend and I went before a show at Heinz Hall last night and though we attempted to wait list for a table we found it easier to grab drinks at the crowded bar.  Sooner rather than later people left and we squeezed in so we had somewhere to eat our ridiculously good mushroom tacos served on a sweet wooden board.  Yes, who knew?  Mushroom tacos were so meaty in texture and flavor, a little spicy too.  Afterwards you feel thankful that the World Health Organization put the kabash on processed meats bc you can live off these tacos for the rest of your life!  Ok and the drinks didn't disappoint either.  I had the aloe+elderflower margarita followed by the grapefruit+sage margarita.  Both were perfectly balanced, neither too sweet nor too savory/herbaceous.    Finally I feel like I found a taqueria like the ones I've been missing since moving from LA.",

We didn't get reservations but were clever enough to go to the restaurant right as they opened and were lucky to get seated and served right away. The atmosphere is very trendy with upbeat music, dimmed red lights and chandeliers. The service was great since they were able to seat us without a reservation and the waiter was helpful and friendly. Now for the good stuff, FOOD was the best! Start out with their guacamole, its not your typical avocoda/lime/cilantro their speciality guacamole has meat and cheeses that add much more to the texture and taste. We ordered the guacamole that had duck meat and blue cheese, probably one of the best guacamole Ive ever had. Since duck is uncommon meat option also ordered duck tacos, they give you two tacos with enough meat and toppings to make them filling. I love the unusual combination of ingredients, everything I ordered exceeded excellence!",

While sitting on the patio, my friends and I observed a man who we're assuming was homeless leave some possessions outside and go inside to (presumably) use the restroom. Immediately, our waiter noticed the pile of blankets and bags of bottles and asked us, the closest table, if it was ours. We said no, it was a man's who went inside. Within a minute there was a manager outside checking out what the stuff was. She picked up the bags and began kicking the blankets along the sidewalk in an attempt to move it away from the restaurant. She even went so far as to throw away his belongings and leave his blankets in a spot where people could step on it.   All of this was done not only in our sight, but seemingly to our benefit. I don't know if the manager and her staff thought we would like to see this treatment of another human being, but we didn't. It was awful. It was uncomfortable and cruel and showy in a way that suggested malice.  It was extremely hard to think about the meal, or carry on with our conversation after witnessing that. In fact, we debated paying for our appetizer and leaving because it was so baste.   The food was fine, but overpriced. The staff was generally fine but our waiter seemed to lose interest in us as soon as we said we didn't want drinks and the portions weren't big enough to justify the price or the hellish display.   I knew it would be pretentious, I had already resigned myself to that when I decided to go. But I didn't expect it to be demoralizing.",

Their tequila list was extensive.  I didn't like that I paid 14 dollars for one shot (Patron), but in comparison to the other tequilas it was a steal.   You COULD NOT get a table.   They were \"reserved\" but we got there at 5 and one table wasn't occupied until nearly six.  Mind you, they only had a handful of tables.  Sitting at the bar was equally satisfying.

    "text": "I am officially in love with tako.  We showed up around 5:00 on a Tuesday to an already packed house, but were able to somehow score a table outside without a reservation (but you should make one, seriously).  Typical Meat & Potatoes, Butcher & the Rye service:  hoverish without being annoying, super helpful.  We had a slew of staff bring us menus, some fine tap, and had our drink orders taken before I could even look at the \"make your own guacamole\" sheet.  Unfortunately I'm not a guac fan, but it was a really cute idea that you get to fill out this scan-tron menu of traditional and a little bizarre options that come with a box of incredible looking chips.  The special (dollar off) frozen margarita was apple so I jumped on that instantly while +1 opted for a mango Jarritos.  We started with the papa bravas to start which were these confit lil' potatoes in garlic red sauce and a bit of cheese in a silver bowl of my new favorite thing.  I was barely done woofing them down when my pollo asado tacos came up.  Spicy but not hot chicken cooled with avocado and white cheese crumbles.  Somehow the best part were the tender (and really sturdy!!) shells. Pretty traditional compared to other options; the +1 played it safe but spicy too getting the al pastor tacos which were gone before I could even see what was in them--caught a glimpse of beef and pineapple. They were a hit with him.  And not to get tacky, but everything was priced well too.  I actually took one of my tacos home (and not just because I filled up on tequila!).  I grabbed a passion fruit margarita before heading out.  Super sweet but just as good as the apple, although not as unique.  Their frozen margaritas, by the way, are perfect.  Nothing syrupy and heavy on the booze. I really wanted to try the lychee, but I could not have more than two of these guys.  More importantly, I also need a reason to come back as soon as possible.",

    "text": "I've been curious about tako for awhile and finally decided to make a reservation for my Dad's birthday. I didn't understand how a restaurant could be booked so many weeks in advance. If you want a Friday or Saturday night reservation before 9 PM, you need to book more than a month in advance. Luckily I was booking for a weeknight so I didn't have much trouble, even though I still booked it about a month ahead of time. When we arrived, I realized the restaurant is pretty small. So it made a little more sense why they booked up so easily. We decided to order a taco board for $75 where we got 12 tacos (6 pairs). One strange thing was that we weren't allowed to order more than one pair of any style taco. We tried to order four fish, and they wouldn't allow it and said we had to pick 6 different styles and couldn't have duplicates. Luckily they all sounded delicious so we easily picked another type. The atmosphere in here is really dark, but not so dark that you can't see all of the attention to detail they put into the aesthetic. We got a queso appetizer. It was the best queso I've ever had. It was sooo delicious! Even better than Bakersfield, which was my previous favorite. The weird thing though was that they served it with maybe 6 small pieces of pita instead of chips. The four of us blew through the pita and were left with all of this cheese and nothing to dip in it. It was kind of depressing. Luckily our waiter brought us some chips, but I don't understand why the chips don't come with it, or at least more pitas. The cheese - pita ratio was way off! When our tacos arrived, they were literally brought out on a giant board that took up most of our table. Every single taco we tried was just as delicious or more delicious than the last. They were all generous with meat and toppings and super filling. We can't wait to come back and definitely recommend the board as a great way to eat with a group and get to try a variety of tacos.",

Funnel cakes were good but nothing to write home about and the hot chocolate they come with was good but rich, could have skipped that.   Everything else was phenomenonal and worth telling everyone about,  definitely my favorite restaurant under the umbrella of meat and potatoes, butcher and rye, etc.   Oh, drinks were delicious too, I highly recommend the spicy passion fruit margarita (I think that's what it was called) or the basil watermelon margarita.

Even after her attitude i still tipped 20% because i know how it is. She was nice at first but then when she got more tables of an older crowd she tended more to them and ignored us and every time she walked past she snatched something off of the table, didn't say a word to us just snatched it up. My friends and i looked at each other like wtf? As a server, i treat everyone equally. Although, i may assume people might not tip it doesn't give the right to give lower quality service because it reflects poorly on the restaurant overall. Impressed with the food and drinks but not impressed with service for my first visit i hope that changes",

The chicken taco was my favorite in a close tie with the steak. The octopus \"tako\" was ok and so was the duck.    Wanted to try something new and was an overall good experience, but slightly overrated. I still think the taco truck in Pittsburgh has better tacos overall.",

Ordered a wide variety of appetizers including Chips & Salsa, Guacamole, Street Corn and Papa Bravos -- all excellent. The chips were warm and crisp, served with 3 types of salsas -- salsa de arbol / roasted tomatillo / tomato poblano.  Guacamole can be customized to your taste however we just went with the basic Chef's Choice recipe. The Street Corn and crispy potato Papa Bravos were big hits. Everyone ordered a different type of taco -- Baja, Carnita, Bistec & Al Porter -- everyone enjoyed their entrees.  Highly recommend reservations.  Cool vibe and strong drinks. Outside seating option is along the sidewalk as well as bar facing the kitchen.  Reservations highly recommended.",

The flavor profiles of the tacos (two per order), the tableside-made guacamole, the cocktails...it all added up for a memorable night even if we could barely see (or hear!) each other in the dimly lit balcony, bumpin' with bass a la house DJ. Reality set in on the the long overdue second visit. Yes, the taco options still juxtapose diverse flavors, but the wow factor just wasn't there. After almost a year, their signature taco had become legend, but on this go around it fell short - the preserved lemon and mizuna greens were too dominant. Their was also a Lenten menu available this visit, and you would think $24 halibut tacos would be blissful, but shame on you tako - bland, Bland, BLAND! Utter disappointment. The winner of the evening was the special shrimp tacos - hell yes to crispy, spicy and Asian flavors! Service at our bar area table was adequate and the food was timely. Decor is sharp + chic, but the lighting could still use a bump up on the dimmers. Nonetheless...seek out tako, revel in the flourishing 4-1-2 food scene and mingle with the young 'n hip at midnight because that's probably the only time you can get a reservation!",

We started with chips and salsa - generous portion and all three salsa varieties were unique and yummy. I had the mushroom takos as a main course, and they were SO good - easily the best tacos I've ever had and I'm still fantasizing about them! Also had a delicious michelada.  The decor is really interesting and fun. It was kind of crowded and loud, but I guess that comes with the territory for a hip new restaurant. You'll definitely want a reservation, even for a weeknight.   I'll definitely be back!",

Pineapple cake - 2 stars - The worst pineapple cake that I have ever eaten in my life. I did not finish it either. Clearly, this restaurant knows how to make tacos but not desserts. Serving sizes - 4.5 stars - good sizes for each appetizer, entree, and dessert. Prices - 3 stars - My husband and I did not order any drinks--just water. The price per item was OK, but I went a bit \"wild\" by ordering so much food, and our total bill was $125.",

    "text": "Tako serves tacos. Tacos. TACOS! That should be enough for you to give it a shot, but I shall elaborate..  I've heard that you typically need a reservation for Tako, but we opted to walk in on Labor Day at opening and got seated right away! But I definitely hear that this is the exception to the rule.   Place is definitely a funky little rap-tastic spot with an underwater industrial/modern goth vibe. My only complaint regarding the ambiance is the lighting. It's a shade above pitch black like so many of these nouveau riche, hipster joints popping up. I like to see my meal. When I can't, I start to panic about possible unseen hairs or aged avocados. Part I of the illusive fifth star.  We ordered two appetizers - chips and salsa and the papas bravas. The chips and salsa came out quickly and included three varieties, salsa de arbol (so good and sooo dangerous) roasted tomatillo (cilantro lover here!), and poblano. They were all jam packed with flavor! Then the papas bravas arrived and almost ruined my dinner.....I COULDN'T stop eating them. They were the perfect balance of crispy and creamy and crunchy and amazing. The aioli is the stuff of fantasies.   As for tacos, we ordered the al pastor, the baja fish, and the bistec. The pork shoulder and pineapple was unparalleled. Acidic and sweet with spice and texture - Oh my! The steak on my husbands bistec was some of the most tender I have ever had the pleasure of tasting!  But here comes part II behind the missing fifth star ....The baja was barely 'meh'. Way too sweet. And not in the sticky savory way like a glaze just downright sugary. It screamed for some acid or a squeeze of lemon. The menu also stated 'tempura white fish'. I've had some tempura in my day and this sure didn't seem like tempura. It had more of a bread crumb texture than anything. The fish was also heavy and a touch too greasy. It broke my heart because I truly love me some fish tacos :(  Dessert special was a tapioca with sorbet and fresh fruit and it was D-VINE! I was unable to get it out of my mind the entire following day.   All in all, it's great. All mistakes need not even seek forgiveness. Super original takes on super tasty dishes. I will go back and eat until I wanna barf, no doubt.",

    "text": "I'm a little surprised to be saying this, but tako was worth the hype. I made a Friday night reservation for four on a whim a few months ago and had all but forgotten about it until I got a text reminder from Yelp, so I rallied some friends (four friends plus myself = party of 5, for which the restaurant was extremely accommodating when I called them that day) and headed downtown. We were seated quickly upstairs, which provided ample opportunity for people watching and yelling across the wide booth at each other over the loud DJ-curated playlist of the evening (which--spoiler alert--might be my only real complaint about tako). We started with drinks, of course, and while my friends enjoyed the red and white sangrias, I'm in the midst of a burgeoning love affair with mezcal, so the lychee and pepper margarita was just the ticket for me. We started with the queso fundido and classic guacamole (pro tip--the queso comes with the most pillow-like tortillas, and the guac comes with a basket of chips which make for perfect queso-dunking once the tortillas sadly run out), and I got the carnitas tacos... mmmm. A pork lover's dream, the carnitas were melt-in-your-mouth buttery with the chicharrones on top to provide some flavor/texture balance. Overall, tako made for a worthwhile (and return-worthy) Friday night out on the tahn ;)",

Erica's service was attentive and helpful but not intrusive and the place was packed. I had the el Diablo margherita and my wife had wine to start and we had the street corn and papa bravas apps. Would recommend both, but the papa bravas was my fav of the two. It was hard to pick the tacos we would order, but settled on the Korean and Baja and shared them. Again, both were delicious, but the Korean was the over the top. An order is two tacos, but don't think that's not enough. They are packed. We could not order dessert because we were so stuffed, but the next table had some wonderful looking desserts! Everything is fresh and really good. Check was 65 bucks with tax. Not bad for the quality and amount of food you get! We'll be back next time we are in the 'Burgh.",

HOWEVER, while i totally love outside seating and watching the kitchen, I will admit that I saw less than appetizing practices. If you are going to let your customers watch you prepare food, please please please make sure your hygiene is on point. I observed chefs eating without washing their hands and going back to touching food. An employee run his fingers through his hair and then delicately place garnish on some taco. A patron sneeze directly toward their ingredients stored in open containers. If a salad bar has a sneeze guard, outside seating should also. And I get it, you're working and wanna listen to music. But if I'm paying $50 for a single meal, please don't make me listen to 50 cent and Eminem songs saying nigga and faggot? Come on guys. If your patrons can here this, you might want to up the classiness. I sat outside for the ambience and experience though. Definitely got that :)",

Even on a Sunday night in downtown Pgh, there were no tables open and the bar was constantly packed! I had been so excited during the month leading up to my reservation, let me tell you!! We sat upstairs at a larger table with my party of 5 for birthday dinners. It's very dark inside and I really loved the decor! I ordered two margs through the night, blood orange and watermelon basil. I preferred the watermelon, it was so fresh and both flavors complimented each other really well. Tako's menu is not that big, that's probably a good thing! Chips and salsa come with three different salsas (my fave was the mild). Made to order guac was a little over priced IMO, but so good! We ordered the plain one and added cojita cheese. The queso fundido got two thumbs up as well! We all ordered different tacos (chicken, mushrooms, al pastor, chorizo, carnitas) and all of us were pleased! I had the carnitas and my god, that delicious pork was crisped to perfection! I definitely cannot wait to go back to tako and try more things, hopefully sooner rather than later!",

Their octopus (Tako) tacos were what you came for, along with the mushrooms and fried chicken ( and everything else) and the drinks and custom guac that you stayed for.   However, to my dismay, over the last year or so, they have taken the same menu and really cheapened it. Meaning the octopus taco that was their staple that used to be grilled... it's now fried with only one piece in it. The mushrooms which were my absolute favorite... now come with a thick  filler and very little of the nice juicy mushrooms.   The guac, which used to taste like it was mashed fresh in your kitchen, full of crab, tuna, or whatever else you ordered, tasted... lackluster.  I want to say store bought but I wouldn't dare make such an accusation.   I came with a group of 15 or more, where everyone had been here previously, and we were all deeply disappointed in the change in style.   I write this review not with spite but with hope they will go back to their old ways. I used to promote this restaurant like I was a paid employee. It was my absolute favorite. I told everyone and anyone who would listen how absolutely fantastic it was. Any chance I got... I. Was. There. So please, go back to your old recipes, not the money pinching ones you're using now.",

For me it is too dark inside, I don't like that look.  I ordered the tako tacos and the wings.  The wings were caramelized fish sauce, bomb!  It had pickled vegetables which provided a nice balance for the wings that had a little kick to it.  The fried skin on it was amazing.  The tako tacos I was told by the bartender is a favorite, it did not let me down.  First off, the tortilla was amazing! I would think all the tacos were good because I know it comes on that tortilla.  The tako itself, very good.  Lightly floured and fried.  This was $22 so I don't know if I would spend that myself (I was traveling for work) but I would definitely suggest any of those other tacos because like I said, that tortilla was amazing!",

You can make reservations through Yelp but I'd advise to do it well in advance because even a few days out (on a a weeknight!) they're booked up, though I believe they take walk-ins. The restaurant space is awesome, the decor is like nothing else I've ever seen. The service was good. Their drink menu is huge and they have something for everyone, everything from cheap beer to plenty of cocktails and margaritas. The one so-so thing was the chips and salsa. I really liked the verde salsa but the other two weren't as good. I'd get the chorizo fundido next time. Another thing I wasn't so crazy about was that the tacos come in twos (you can't just order one) so you really have to commit, not so much a problem for a group of people as you can obviously share. The Korean tacos were fantastic, probably the best tacos I've had in Pittsburgh. The steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned and there was plenty on it. The tacos are sizable too. Prices are semi-reasonable. Definitely check this place out.",

I couldn't decide, since everything looked so good on the menu, so I took the suggestion of our bartender and she definitely steered me in the right direction, though all of us enjoyed our food. The tacos were also a lot bigger than I expected and filled me up more than I thought they would.   I can't wait to go back. There is so much I want to try!",

They were bursting with flavor and had tons of shrimp. My kid got a steak taco with just cheese, avocado and sour cream. The steak was cooked perfectly and frankly I don't think you could make a basic steak taco that tasted better. The house guacamole was fine, but nothing special. The food was definitely 5 star. I gave it 4 stars because I didn't love my margarita, the guac portion was small and the prices were high.  We are going back every 2 weeks until I have tried all the flavors of tacos do obviously I would highly recommend this place. Enjoy!",

    "text": "In town for business and excited to try out tako based on the reviews. Unfortunately, the service or lack thereof, soured our party on everything. First of all when we inquired about a table, we were told there was nothing available for the rest of the night inside. Not a big deal, we put our name in the waitlist for outside.   Once seated, we waited for several minutes before a server came to take our order. Once we placed our orders, it was easily 20 minutes before our drinks arrived. Our drinks were simple, a house margarita and a can of ginger ale. This seemed like a long time to wait for such a simple order.  We had also placed our dinner order and when we ordered our drinks. Our server never came back to check on us or to even advise us if our food was near to being ready. We're were a party of four and We each ordered tacos. At the 40 minute mark, still no entrees in sight it began to pour down rain.   First of all, a 40 minute wait for tacos is ludicrous. Running from the rain, We brought our drinks inside and miraculously there were tables available, when we had been told earlier that the inside was booked for the entire evening.  Our food showed up immediately, as we were seated upstairs. One of my colleagues posted a review in yelp as we were sitting down with our food, regarding the lackluster service. within minutes of it being posted, the manager came to our table to make sure that everything was okay. If our server had just been even half as quick to check in with us even once, maybe our reviews would've been much more positive. At that point, we were just happy to have our food after such a long wait.   The True kicker though was the manager catching one of my colleagues on the way out. He told my colleague that her friend's review upset him.  What???? Many restaurants will offer some sort of compensation for such a bad experience. Maybe a free round of drinks or a coupon for a return visit. Nothing of the sort was offered. We were the ones that should've been and were upset. To be honest, my review on the service alone would be one star. I'm just bumping to two stars because the al pastor tacos were some of the best I've had.",

They mostly do come with cilantro so if you don't like it make sure to specify. They do have an interesting cocktail menu as well, definitely different and unique. The only downfall was that it took over 10mins to get our cocktails and our food also took over 25mins. It took them 10minutes to tell me they couldn't make my drink due to lack of ingredients and then another 5mins at least to get my drink. The people next to us, who sat after us, got their food well before we did. So the service needs some fine tuning.",

    "text": "I want to start this review with positive statement that Every time visiting Pittsburgh we make sure to visit couple of Richard Deshantz's  restaurants. We've been to B&R next door and M&P around the corner.  tako was the third restaurant of this group that we wanted to try. And up until this experience we loved everything about the other two. This time it was different. They seated us (in spite of the reservation) at the worst table possible (right in front of the WC (restroom) door). And though I noticed two tables available upstairs the hostess refused to change table reasoning that party of 4 they expect to be seated there. Well, after a little while she seated a party of 2 (just like us) and that was the end of it. To tell you the truth we wouldn't be that irritated by the situation if the good people of Pittsburgh would show their nice attitude to the fellow patrons by closing the door on the way out of the mentioned WC. But guess what, 99.9 % of the people didn't!?!?... Either because of the luck of their manners or might be they thought it would be so appetizing for us to add some additional smells and the \"beautiful\" site of the restroom to our culinary experience, but who knows what they were thinking? One thing is for sure we know what we were thinking about the \"beautiful\" culture of Pittsburgh. To make a long story shorter: food (except of desserts which were good) was unremarkable at best;  service was hectic, unprofessional but trying to please (thank you at least for that);  ambiance was described in the first part of the review;  drinks were the lowest quality we ever had;  and value for all of the above was really bad. The saving grace was done by the manager who took desserts off the check and agreed with our concerns about the WC door (hopefully something will be done about it for the sake of future customers sitting at this spot). So if it wouldn't be for him handling the situation my rating would be 1* period. Conclusion: no go for us, and you decide for yourself.",

Then I ordered the carnitas tacos and he ordered the..shoot I can't remember the name but it's the first taco choice on the list of tacos. We split them and my god I could not pick which one I liked more. They were both amazing in their own right.   Then because I saw one being made as I ate my amazing tacos I just had to get the choco taco dessert. Boy am I happy I did. It was amazing. It's a cone taco shell with ice cream in it and cherries on the plate. My advice is to top each bite with some of the cherries, you won't be sorry.    The atmosphere is awesome. The people working there are friendly and wonderful. The food is the tops. If you only have one place to eat while in Pittsburgh I would make it this place!",

If it wasn't for it being a late night on a Wednesday, I would've loved to have a second drink and try something else. It was crowded for 7pm and we got lucky getting the last 2 seats at the bar.

    "text": "So winding out the end of year in Pittsburgh and decided after flying in a little bit early to give Tako a try. I had heard quite a bit of mixed reviews to date and it had been on my bucket list for trying out so glad I was finally able to do so. Since I was in relatively early on a Sunday, there was no wait and there were plenty of seats to be found at the bar. I pulled up a chair as close to the right end of the bar as possible so I could get a glimpse of the chefs preparing the food. The decor is the whole dark/mysterious/casual vibe with the DJ like music playing in the background.   They provide their menus in newspaper format with a list of separate specials if you desire to peruse. I will admit the prices are a bit steep here for the portion but where else can you get something like this in Pittsburgh. The menu is broken down into multiple small plates and then multiple varieties of tacos. They also have a relatively large selection of adult beverages and the bartenders are pretty knowledgeable even with the standard curve balls of \"surprise me with an awesome drink.\" The tacos are a decent portion and if you do not eat tons, I could see one order of tacos and an appetizer being enough to satisfy the hunger. If you are super hungry then I could see two orders of taco doing the trick. The multia was a special and pretty solid. It came with mole and avocado. All ingredients were blended well together and I loved the freshness of the cilantro and onion sitting on top. It was a solid way to start the meal washed down with their version of an old fashioned. I followed up with waiting for my Korean tacos which came out quickly afterwards on a wooden board branded with the words tako. The tacos were well made and did not skimp on the ingredients. They were packed with flavors including kochujang and loved the cucumbers sliced into it. I would definitely recommend asking for the housemade hot sauce which adds a nice kick to the overall dish. I wrapped up with some lychee drink which was solid but the hummingbird at the end was the solid closer.   All in all, I thought this place was great and im a fan of what they are doing. Not sure how easy it is to just swing by for a bite but definitely a place I will try to hit back up in the future. The bartenders were also super friendly and very helpful. Def a plus",

    "text": "This place is seriously AWESOME. I first heard about it when I was home and interning in NYC for the summer (I go to school in Pittsburgh) and my supervisor went to Tako while doing business in Pittsburgh. So, it's safe to say that Tako was on the top of my list of places to try when coming back to school.  The abidance itself is a little dark, however it does remind me of something inspired by trendy NYC restaurants. The seating is a little uncomfortable- I am not a fan of seats without backings and the stools are not the most comfortable, but I digress.  The queso is a must-try... trust me. It comes with chorizo in it and it's just out of this world. It's served with warm tortillas, the same ones used for their tacos, however when those run out I simply use my fork, because the queso is THAT good.   I have tried an array of the tacos, and I think my favorite is the Korean taco. The flavor and combination of ingredients just really wowed me. I also enjoyed the Tako tako (grilled octopus) and though I have to be in the mood for grilled octopus, it was very flavorful and had a slight spice factor to it. The duck taco was also good, and same with the fish taco and al pastor taco, however these were not my favorites.   The food service is speedy and the tacos are of very good quality. This is one of my favorite places to go while at school when wanting to splurge a little bit on good food. If you find yourself in Pittsburgh, Tako is a must-try.",

One thing to note, you do need to make reservations a bit in advance so plan accordingly. With our reservation, we had no issues getting seating on time.  I order the spicy cucumber margarita and hands down was one of the best margaritas I've had. It's made with fresh ingredients and you can taste the tequila which I loved.  For an appetizer, we ordered the queso and wings. The wings are super crispy and covered in a sweet and spicy sauce. They even give you hot hand towels to wipe the sauce off. The queso was good but would have been a bit easier to eat with chips. The tortillas that come with make it a bit hard to eat but it's good.  I had the carnitas tacos for my meal and I will say they are quite large tacos. I couldn't even finish my second one. I would definitely go back to try the others.  Our waitress was amazing! She explained everything and was always around to fill up our drinks. It's hard to find service like that at other places.   The atmosphere is a bit different as well but it goes with the place. The only thing to note is there is one bathroom for the whole restaurant that is unisex. Just be prepared for that.",

Their Tako Taco is phenomenal; the grilled octopus is perfectly complemented with the chickpeas and creamy aioli. Their full menu is such a great fusion of Asian flavors (yuzu, soy, ginger, shishito, etc.) into each of their tacos and also margaritas (El Diablo is my favorite)!  Often hard to get a seat, but I would suggest walking in with a small party (2-3) and waiting to seat at the bar. Otherwise, be ready to book reservations at odd hours or at least a month in advance.",

    "text": "I was really excited to try Tako but I feel like this place is a bit overhyped.  I loved the outside which looked like a real taqueria, but once we went inside it looked more like a club scene--it was quite dark, cramped, loud, and there was even a DJ spinning.  This might be fun for a club/bar scene, but this is supposed to be a restaurant and they were still serving dinner.  I could barely hear my friend speak or the waiter.  The inside atmosphere was very hipster and a bit pretentious.   We weren't able to get a dinner reservation until 10pm since they were so busy, so my friend and I had already had drinks elsewhere first.  Since I was driving I decided to order a soda.  Our malebun-wearing pretentious hipster waiter got all offended by this and stormed off without even taking my friend's order.  Another waiter returned 15 min later with my soda and they still didn't ask my friend what she wanted to drink.  It's possible he was also offended because I missed or misunderstood something he said because it was so loud in there.  But this did not get us off to a good start.    We had the queso dip which was quite good, though a little pricey, and we needed to get more tortillas to go with it.  The octopus taco (which this placed is named for, as tako means octopus in japanese) was amazing.  The best octopus taco I ever had.  I also had a carne asada taco which felt like it was lacking in some key ingredient and was not that memorable.  The waiter finally spoke to us and became more friendly when he was all excited to explain all the homemade salsas.  Unfortunately none of them were very impressive.  One tasted just like a bbq sauce, not a salsa, and none were very spicy.  Definitely not authentic tasting.  In general, the prices are a bit high compared to other places that have comparable tacos and you don't get any side dishes or anything with your meal.    I'd go back for the octopus taco but nothing else I thought was really amazing.  I will have to go back for their drinks another time, as they did appear to have a good tequila selection.",

Service was fast enough considering how packed they were and this was 5:30 on a Friday - I was surprised we even got a table by how packed it was. Kind of upset that they didn't have a vegetarian friendly queso and also you have to pay $1 or something for them to refill your chips and they definitely do not give you enough chips to start with in comparison to all the dip you get with the order. Wish I had time to try a drink or dessert. Also - way too dark in there. All of my friends were tripping up the stairs because our eyes were not adjusted to the dark. I like ambiance but seriously way too dark. Will definitely be back to try the poke!",

Good thing the weather was nice and outdoor seating was available in 20 minutes when we got there. One word of advice, definitely go for outdoor seating if you can. The environment inside is just way too chaotic, dark and bar-like, that you can barely hold a decent conversation with the people you're with. I'm not too sure what vibe they are going for, but indoor seating is definitely not ideal.   As for the tacos, they are hands down one of the best I've tasted albeit a little pricey. If you're planning on ordering 7 or more sets, get the combos which will save you a bit of money if you're going for the more expensive tacos. I tried the chorizo, Korean, Baja and pork shoulder one. Each of them had just the right amount of filling and flavor. I'd recommend the Korean most, because it's a nice twist to your regular taco. If you're a fan of egg, go for the chorizo one.  Two tacos in a set might seem like a little, but I was stuffed after my first 2 out of 4. Will definitely come back when I get the chance too! (And hopefully get outdoor seating...)",

I was not hungry at all after a late lunch but felt inclined to partake because of a friend's recommendation to come here. Ordered the mushroom tacos because the word *truffle* was listed in the description, and they were delicious. However, as much as these tacos were packed with ingredients, they are damn expensive. $12-18 for 2 tacos?? I don't live in Pittsburgh anymore so not sure if this is reasonable but I've gotten similar quality tacos in other cities for a third or a half of the price. Everything else on the menu (guacamole, drinks, etc) seemed priced comparatively for a Mexican restaurant though, but the name of this place is tako, so you should be prepared to get some (pricey) tacos.",

    "text": "I travel to Pittsburgh for work and this place has been on my short list of restaurants to try.  Reservations are always booked solid, for the dinner hour.  I took a chance and dropped in and managed to get a seat at the bar.  The place was sufficiently full for a Tuesday evening.  I was given a menu in the form of a newspaper (pretty cool).  I bypassed the specialty margaritas for a standard margarita (sugar rim).  My margarita and a huge basket of warm tortilla chips and salsa arrived, while I waited for my order. The margarita was expertly prepared, strong and tasty!  I ordered the build-your-own guacamole and al pastor tacos.  The guacamole arrived really quickly, and I proceeded to dig in using the chips that had come with my salsa.  On a scale from 1-10, the guac was maybe a 6.5/7, needed a bit more salt, which I added.  It also had thinly slice jalapeno mixed in and was covered in shredded cilantro?  It's REALLY dark, so I can't confirm.  The guac just didn't do it for me, not at the hefty price tag of $11.  The portion was not that large, maybe enough to share with one other person, as long as you had another appetizer.  The price point should have been somewhere in the $6-7 range.  Also if you include additional add-in, the price ranged from $16-20, which I thought was a bit steep, but maybe it's just me.  A basket of plaintains or yuca chips would have been nice and maybe would have justified the price, a llittle bit.  A short time later the al pastor tacos arrived, nice portion, topped with pineapple ( I expected more of a char/caramelization), The tacos were really, really salty, almost inedibly salty.  I had to request water to chase the salty tacos.  The flavors were good except for the extra saltiness.  The tacos were 2/$12, so once again, not sure that the pricing was on point for what I received.  I do understand why other Yelpers like tako, so much; great concept, excellent food options, but just didn't do it for me.",

I'm sure you need to make a reservation for dinners: it was packed when we went there, our timing was good just by chance. Everything I ate there was SO DELICIOUS! Yes, it was expensive but the flavors were so rich, everything was so fresh and service was great. Pittsburghers- you are lucky!",

I would see the guys working in their kitchen, prepping for the day with sliding door open, and 90s music blasting from their work station. I would wave to the guys and receive a welcome response in return. I always thought this was interesting because I tried to get lunch here one day and to my surprise they don't open until dinner, even though they began prep so early. Even so, I knew this was something special that I wanted to try.  My True introduction started on a weekend evening. This place looks like a hole in the wall at first glance, but it's really an upscale fusion restaurant. Be forewarned that this one of the hottest upscale bars/restaurants in downtown Pittsburgh right now. Crowds and a long wait should be expected.  The main seating area has a festive vibe that makes it a great group place, as well as date nights out. The drink selection is insane and full of life, with everyone imbibing.  The tacos and pairings were delicious, fresh, and well done...all two bites of them. All-in-all, the food is delicious and interesting, but be prepared to pay for it!",

    "text": "So many taco places! So many up scale, Low key and homestyle locations to choose from! What a time to be alive and in Pittsburgh! We went to Tako for restaurant week recently and my knees are weak thinking about it!  Like Meat and Potatoes and Butcher and the Rye, The decor of Tako is nothing short of interesting (you should see the bathroom)! The staff is great and the food is killer! We ordered some delicious guacamole that had crab in at, along with a restaurant week special, short rib queso fondue. The fondue was tasty but I definitely preferred the guac! I want to go back and try every combination of ingredients they have!   For my entree, I ordered the Korean tacos. Now, I am a jerk. I have a pet peeve about portions. While I want to get my money's worth, I hate huge portions because I fear that I will either overeat or waste leftovers. These tacos are gigantic! They are basically an entire meal resting on top of a tortilla. However, these tacos were way too amazing to be upset! A mountain of crispy wagyu short ribs with peanuts, fermented cucumbers, cilantro and cabbage came together so deliciously that I have craved these tacos everyday since I ate them a month ago! Bonus? They were $14 for two! If you go to Smoke, a wagyu taco will set you back almost $10 for one and it would certainly not be as satisfying! If I had only ordered the tacos I would have been as equally satisfied.   I go to Butcher a lot for happy hour but I think I need to start switching it up and going next door every once and a while. I think my wallet and belly will thank me!",

    "text": "Kudos to the Tako, Butcher, and Meat & Potatoes crew for staying True to their niche. Ambience and flavor in a trendy setting seems to be their calling here in Pittsburgh. With Tako they took a unique route and gave True meaning to \"yinzerita.\" Hailing from NYC and having spent tremendous time in countries where \"flavor\" serves to be life's impetus I can truly say my palette left a happy camper. The cobia ceviche was spot on - light and bright and bursting with cucumber flavor. The fish sauce was a phenomenal addition to the wings and it's this out-of-box thinking that gives foodies a job. In the midst of all the salsa dancing that took place on my tongue my liver, too, felt like dancing after a lychee & pepper x 2 (and maybe a grapefruit & sage) margarita. The latter was a bit herbal (maybe easier on the sage) but overall, fantastic drinks. Best margaritas I have had in town, period.   Now, for the proverbial filler. My favorite taco had to be the Chorizo followed by the Al Pastor and finally the Korean. A delicate and melt in your mouth shell filled with well cooked meats, seasoned and spiced appropriately. Perfect! I cared not for the grilled octopus nor the Baja (I tried others) - as, plain and simply, I've had better. Better meaning Mexico, California, and San Antonio themselves.  When you're being compared to the numero 23's of Mexican food world you know you did something right.  Not bad Tako, not bad.   Kudos  Highlights: Atmosphere, bold flavors, margaritas Pros: Above Cons: Easy on the herbs in the drinks (but this was just once), octopus and fish were a little chewy, but overall good flavors Recommend to a friend: Yes Recommend to family: Yes Would do well in a big city with a huge culinary following: Yes",

Tonight was the second time I have visited Tako and it is easily becoming one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh! Both times I have gone during the week with my girlfriends. If you are looking to go here you basically need to make reservations weeks in advance... but it is so worth the wait.  The atmosphere inside of Tako is unlike anything I have ever seen before. From walking in and immediately seeing the cooks making their famous tacos, to the dim lighting and candle lit tables.  This place is sure to catch your eye. Both times I visited we were sat upstairs in the booths. I love that it is a private & intimate setting!   We actually ended up having the same waiter both times I was there! He was very attentive & helpful. Tonight he recommended the watermelon basil margarita for my drink which was AMAZING! I have also tried the grapefruit sage margarita & my girlfriend got the sangria- you basically can't go wrong with any of their cocktails. To start, we ordered the queso fundido. I recommend to order this with tortilla chips instead of the warm tortillas that is typically served with. This is LITERALLY finger licking good. I am obsessed.    For meals on both occasions I ordered tacos.....duh. My friends and I split the Korean, al pastor, and chorizo tacos a few months ago. We loved all of them, but I probably wouldn't order the chorizo again (we all agreed the texture & the fried egg we could do without). Tonight I had the carnitas, which were to die for. I truly believe you can't come to Tako and not have a great experience. There is nothing bad I can say about this place. Everyone needs to go to Tako!!!",

At times, it can be difficult to be seated, but I'm not complaining, because their food makes up for any inconvenience.   The staff is pleasant, knowledgeable, and genuine. They are all familiar with the menu, and they take pride in their work. It's apparent that everyone at this restaurant loves the food.   The prices here are reasonable and commensurate with the portion sizes that they offer. They also have a fairly extensive drink menu, which caters to their Mexican theme. Overall, I strongly recommend this restaurant.",

We called in to place an order and was told it would be 40 minutes but they can't take orders over the phone to place the order through doordash, ok no problem. Went to order and the menu through doordash and the actual restaurant menu is different which is disappointing because we could not order everything we wanted. Placed an order anyway and was told through doordash it would be ready in 20 minutes. Went to pick it up and was told it would be ready in an additional 45 minutes because doordash gives the wrong times. When 45 minutes passed I called to see if it was ready and was told it would probably be another 30 minutes but she would ask the kitchen. After being on hold was told it would be an additional 40 to 45 minutes. After waiting the additional time we went back to pick it up in hopes our order would be ready. It was and asked why our order took so long since it was suppose to take 20 minutes and we ended up waiting closer to 2 hours for two tacos and an order of chips and queso. We were told by the host we were dealing the whole time they they got sat with 40 people which is just the restaurant seating and your restaurants book up and rarely have walk ins especially for a 40 top walk in. So I asked if ticket orders don't get completed in order then and she said honestly I don't know why it took so long because we had one table that waited 45 minutes just for guac. I can understand if they were short staffed but this specific restaurant should take notes from the rest of the restaurants in this group if they are busy they tell me what the expected wait is and then tell me they will call me when the order is ready. Our food was great when we finally got it but waiting for two hours was a waste and if we would have know it was going to be that much of a hassle we would have just ordered from butcher and the rye or meat and potatoes. We now know not to order takeout from Tako and just make a reservation if we want to eat from there.",

    "text": "I love tacos and was very excited to finally try this place. My first impression was \"Wow. This place is super loud.\" It wasn't as much the crowd as it was the DJ. Yes, DJ. I didn't understand the purpose of a DJ at a taco restaurant but it sure made me want to leave quicker. Maybe that's the goal...to turn tables faster.  My second impression came after the menus arrived. \"Wow. This place is EXPENSIVE.\" The various tacos averaged around $15. For two tacos. This limits your ability to try different tacos unless you are there with a group and share different orders. I went there anticipating a plate of 4 different tacos to try. Since that would have cost me north of $60, I ended up trying the Tako- a Korean BBQ taco which lead to my third impression.  \"Wow. THIS is what all the fuss is about?\" I've had Korean BBQ tacos before (that cost half as much) and these weren't even as good. They were tasty, but certainly not worth $15 for an order of two. All in all, I left a little hungry (remember that you only get two tacos per order), a little poorer, and a LOT disappointed. Their tacos all seemed to be creative combinations of flavors but for their mainstay taco--the one that carries their name--to taste like something I can make at home with a jar of marinade from Giant Eagle...definitely a little disappointing. I fear that this place is inflated because of hype and potentially because there aren't that many places to get good tacos in Pittsburgh.  If you are searching for tacos in PGH, I have to recommend Las Palmas in Brookline. The tacos are much better. Period. Buuuuuut it also helps that you can get seven of them for the same price as two at Tako and that there's no wait to eat and that your ears aren't ringing when you leave.",

However, I had to make a reservation about 5 weeks in advance for a Friday at 6:30 pm. This wouldn't seem so ridiculous if the place was packed, but there were empty tables that remained empty the whole time I was there. It's a casual vibe and my friends and I were in nice shirts and jeans--by no means underdressed. However, our waitress made us feel uncomfortable as if we were out of place. She was curt and looked at us as if we had five heads when we ordered drinks (we are all 21+). Overall, the food was fine. It was not worth a 5 week waiting period. They were good tacos, but definitely overpriced. The experience felt rushed and we were out of there within 35 minutes tops. Next time I want tacos and margaritas, I'll be going back to Condado Tacos.",

In fact, I'm back again on Wednesday to try the other items on their menu that I didn't get to on Monday! This \"getting full\" thing is annoying. If only I was a bottomless pit.. I'd pretty much move in above Tako! Their bartenders really know how to mix great cocktails. I'd recommend the pineapple-jalapeno margarita and the spicy cucumber if you like a spicy kick to your drink like I do. The mushroom tacos are the BEST ever! We also enjoyed the mushroom queso and butternut squash tostadas. Service is super fast and efficient. I like sitting at the bar here but if you absolutely need a table, reservations are strongly recommended..even on a weekday. This place is always packed! No wonder they don't do happy hour specials! They don't need do. But considering the upscale vibe that this place has, and their prices, I feel they needn't charge $1 to refill tortillas that come with the $12 Queso! That's my one peeve.. Don't get cheap on the tortillas, tako.. come on now! Be above that!",

Seriously fresh as can be, with every single ingredient made from scratch. And not loaded with artificial sugar. These are margaritas I can sip on and enjoy. The menu is always changing, with new items popping up monthly. You can never go wrong with their guacamole, and be sure to try all their house-made hot sauces --all a little different but so fresh and packing the perfect punch. Was sad when I found out their in-house flour taco shells are made with lard. Fortunately they have a vegan/gluten free corn shell to substitute with. They are able to accommodate a vegan with the mushroom taco, but you must omit the kale slaw, aioli, and substitute the corn shell. Waiter looked at me like I had three heads as I ordered - not running back here to spend my money.",

We were tired, hungry, and looking to visit solid Pitt foodie spots -- it seems as though we did just that! We didn't have to wait too long, especially having dropped in without a reservation. A quick stroll around the block and our table was ready. We started with a drink each, and were impressed by how professional and well made the drinks were. I had the grapefruit sidecar, and she had the watermelon margarita, and we were both happy with how refreshing they were -- a perfect drink to sit with outside.   We were eyeing the guac menu, but opted for the Mexican street corn instead. It was my girlfriends first encounter with it, and she's been making it at least once a week since. It's easy to say, she's hooked. We also had the chorizo and carnitas tacos, which were absolutely delicious. I loved seeing them making the tortillas by hand -- something I don't think I've ever seen before in any other restaurant. The fresh ingredients, from the tortillas to the sauces on top, make all the difference.",

My daughter had the chicken tacos and I had the Korean (upon the bartender suggestions) and both were excellent. Plenty of food and great service at the bar.

But I've had better, for example pgh taco truck. These tacos were pretty salty and had huge chunks of Brussels and mushrooms.. I just wasnt wowed. My guy said his were really salty also.

That was just the beginning of the humiliating mess she created. Coming from someone who has tried various restaurants and foods across the globe, it should mean something when I say I have never been more turned off. Though the food was great, the beyond crappy service made the whole experience pretty sour. Hope the next person has a better experience there.  P.S. Maybe put more thought into who you hire to work for you. It'll do you a world of good since the food and ambiance is so top notch! (For example, fire Katie.)",

My favorite were the Duck and Octopus tacos! The herbs/ spices they use were so fresh! Our bartender was incredible. Cannot wait to go back the next time we're in town!",

    "text": "I was very excited to try Tako after it just opened a few days ago. A reservation is a must and it looks like you need to call ahead first as they do not appear to be on open table yet. This place is loud and by loud I mean that I could barely hear the person sitting right across from me. It was also difficult to hear the server and we were practically invading each other's personal space to place drink and food orders. The server was very attentive and very knowledgeable about pretty much every drink. I respect that because not every sever can recommend a drink based from what your likes and dislikes are. I started off with a Ramons gin fizz. Yes Ramons, not Ramos as we expected. It was served in a tiki mug and had a lot of ice in it. The taste was refreshing with hints of citrus and lime. Next, I ordered the aloe and elderflower, which had one large ice cube in it and was oh so tasty with just a touch of sweetness. The only good item that I tried was the queso. I felt it was gritty and had too much cilantro on top and was only served with three tortillas. Next time, I will be sure to order more food items and report back!",

Be aware though: This place is super super small, you are basically sitting with your neighbor, very loud music and dark like a club. I think its awesome, but it is certainly something you need to be in the mood for. Don't go there if you are just looking to relax, it def has an upbeat vibe.  The service was great! Although it was tiny the manager was able to accommodate our request to sit outside away from the crowd (reservations aren't taken for outside) due to my bf's medical problems. They were super nice and the wait wasn't too long. Service was great through the entire meal. I especially like that everyone was \"hip\" but very nice and down to earth. The drinks were AMAZING. Seriously two of the best cocktails I have every had..high alcohol content (I watched bartender make it), yet it tasted great and not like alcohol too strong. Two margaritas and I had a great buzz going. I recommend the passion fruit margarita, so yummy, and pretty! The spicy cucumber margarita was great too, could actually taste the heat.  The food....this place is definitely all about the drinks/vibe, which is fine. The food was really good though, but not the best tacos I have had or anything...they are not \"Mexican\" style in case that is what you are looking for...rather they are very \"clean\" and simple tacos, lots of good options, the pork and pineapple was great!! Lots of fun apps to share, the street corn was really nice.  I def want to go back to try some more margaritas! Loved the place! They really have something good going on....MUST have a reservation though or you are not getting in.",

The corn and tuna were just mediocre for us - we thought they were over seasoned and a little harsh on the taste buds. The wings were cooked really well, the meat literally fell off of it. We got three tacos to share, the octopus and the Korean pork. They both were absolutely wonderful and totally demolished the apps to be honest. I will definitely go back for them but probably won't eat any apps next time. We didn't drink so I can't speak to that but the drink menu looked like it was on point! Maybe I'll try those next time ;)",

Everything from their cocktails, to our incredible hoisan glazed wings, and life-changing tacos (Pollo Asado and Korean) was AMAZING!

I had the pastor and octopus taco with no drinks or appetizers and my bill after tip and tax was $44 and I was still hungry. I would say Bakersfield is 85% as good at 1/3 the cost.   The Octopus taco is their most popular taco and my friend didn't finish hers for not liking the texture. At first I didn't like it, but the taste and texture grew on me. It's a unique flavor unlike any traditional meat taco. I would say it's not worth the $22. The pastor taco was good and the pineapple added a citrus flavor without overpowering it.",

For dinner, our group ordered fish tacos, the specialty quesadilla, and the poke plate. Everything was served very quickly and was fresh and delicious. They also have an extensive drink menu, including margaritas, sangria, beer, and frozen drinks. I went with the cucumber jalapeno margarita which was amazing. Overall, just a great experience, from the service to the food, and the vibe in the restaurant is very trendy and cool.   Two tips:  1. Make a reservation early (they book up fast) 2. Get the guac!",

Ordered the street corn and wings for apps. The street corn comes in a bowl and the flavors are really nice though It is a bit spicy. The wings were really good also and has this Asian sesame dressing that made them really unique.   For entrees we got the shrimp tempura and the pastor tacos. Each order comes with two tacos but the tacos are generous in portion. You can tell their tortillas are made fresh daily (and there's also an open kitchen where you can watch them prepare the dishes). I really enjoyed both dishes. The pastor tacos came with some pineapple with gave the dish a nice addition that I really enjoyed.   Topped it off with tres leches for dessert. Although I enjoyed this dish it was on the sweet side.   Will definitely come back to try some other dishes from the menu. Reason I'm taking a star off is because it is pretty pricy for tacos.",

Just costs more than the other tacos. SPICY PINEAPPLE MARG: Refreshing, sweet, and spicy as the name suggests. There's a slice of a serrano pepper in there. TRES LECHES: Okay so the first time I came here, they had this deconstructed cheesecake as the featured dessert and that was so good. Same thing with this tres leches. There's this whipped cream cheese sauce they put that's so delicious. I neeeed that recipe...  Fun, trendy taco spot in downtown.

    "text": "Okay Pittsburgh - lets taco about your tako obsession. After venturing through many American cities, this restaurant fell incredibly short on their fusion taco.  We ordered variety of tacos and the first thing I noticed was the portion of the meat on each taco. Trust me I like my meats but the quantity was overwhelming and we couldn't even wrap the tacos in the traditional way. The tortilla is close to perfection though.  Secondly, the price for the tacos are some of the most expensive I have ever seen and I'm from DC! I mean there were tacos close to 20 dollars. There are numerous taco joints that are just as good for half the price. But I'm assuming the ambiance and location make it such a trendy spot. The inside decor is fun and edgy tho so I can see why it attracts so many people. The drinks are average but they're priced decently.   Overall, once you get over how overloaded and pricey the tacos are, the flavors of the tacos are agreeable. The meat is cooked well but I expected more heat/flavor for a Korean fusion restaurant. The staff was attentive even though getting reservations was a pain. I also liked that I could see the tacos being made through a transparent window near the entrance. I'm a huge taco aficionado and enjoy trying out different spins on tacos but this just fell short. However, there are other reasons to visit this restaurant such as the ambiance and appetizers so stop by if you're close and manage to snag a seat.",

While pricier than the first two taco establishments, the tacos are not a terrible value. My dad and I went with some family to dinner here. We were greeted by a cramped, dimly lighted, modern, restaurant. My family and I were seated on the top floor. When ordering we decided to start with an appetizer of papas bravas. This potato dish was very good. The whole family gave it a universal thumbs up. For the main course we decided to get the taco board. This board of 12 tacos was a decent value. The tacos were 2 pairs of octopus tacos, a pair of fish tacos, a pair of carnitas tacos, a pair of chicken tacos, and a pair of chorizo tacos. All of the tacos were incredible. They were the best tasting tacos I have ever had by a long shot. The tacos were all very filling. My family decided to split the tacos so everyone could get a little of everything. The groups universal favorite taco was the carnitas. If you can only choose one taco I would recommend this. My second favorite was the octopus. The octopus was cooked to perfection and it melted in my mouth. The chicken tacos were excellent and could hold their own. The chorizo tacos were paired with an egg creating a very unique combination of flavors. The fish tacos were solid as well. The thing that stood out from Tako is that the chef is so good at creating unique combinations of flavors that all blend together to create an incredible taco. Tako served me the best tacos I have ever had. If budget is not a concern it would be ludicrous to pass up this restaurant. Even with a budget the prices are not terrible. A pair of tacos is very filling and is definitely a full meal. Tako surpassed my expectations and showed that modern Mexican can compete with authentic food",

    "text": "The pros:  Our waitress was great! She was attentive and energetic, with frequent checkbacks.  I split an appetizer and had 2 tacos, and left happily sated.   The margs were delicious, a tad overpriced for the size (see below) but potent cocktails nonetheless.   The ambiance is cool! It's well decorated and low lit.   The huh?:  One single stall bathroom for the entire restaurant...with nowhere to wait in line unless you block the servers station. That's a major space design issue.   The tables are SO close together. People have trouble getting in and out, even the servers have trouble standing in between to take orders or drop food off. It's hard to have a conversation and hard to navigate.   The bad:   The lack of vegetarian options is nothing short of egregious. There was literally *one* taco on the menu that was meatless: the artichoke. Luckily I like artichokes and it was delicious, but with pea shoots and lemon, it's not gonna be for everyone, especially if I had wanted a spicy/traditional taco flavor.  The flavors were more suited to pasta than a taco. I was super surprised at the lack of meatless options. Artichoke is not something everyone loves. No tofu? No portobello mushroom? No eggplant?   Every other taco had fish or meat, which is *so disappointing* from a place that serves one of the most versatile foods on earth. I wonder if they realize that they are isolating a large customer base.   My non vegetarian friend enjoyed her chorizo tacos but said they were very greasy, especially with the egg.    The summer nachos were luckily a vegetarian special appetizer and they were very tasty.   The prices are bananas. $16 for two artichoke tacos  is nuts. The margs are good but overpriced for the size.   I was very excited to try this place, and am happy I got to go, but I don't see myself returning, since I've eaten the only thing on the menu I can have there, anyway.",

Not only that, but their menu has unique choices not just revolving around their taco selection.   Along with great food, their service is top notch! In and out if you're in a rush, a great place if you have places to go. Though the interior will have you wanting to stay and observe the oceanic scenery. For sure a place to go too if you want to impress someone with.",

The menu isn't too large, and I'd be comfortable with guaranteeing that anything you get will be enjoyable. Also the atmosphere and wait staff were both really nice. I was sitting outside on a rainy day. The warmth resonated from the kitchen and the awning kept me dry. I recommend outdoor seating if you're with one other person.  I and my friend ordered the wings as an appetizer and then split the pastor and the shrimp tempura. The wings were one of the greatest things I've ever eaten - bursting with flavor. The tacos were large and filled with fresh ingredients that created unique flavors. 10/10 would eat again and recommend to anyone.",

My friends and I started out with the original guac, salsa, and queso fundido with their house made chips. The chips and queso came out nice and warm while the guacamole and salsa was nice and cool. Perfect balance!   I ordered the shrimp tempura tacos and a side of the Mexican Street corn (order this- you're welcome!) in the summer months the Mexican Street corn is served on the cob, and the rest of the year it is served in a bowl. Both still amazing!   This was my first time ordering the shrimp tempura tacos (2 per order) but they did not disappoint. If you like shrimp tempura sushi rolls, then you'll love this play on it for tacos.   The place itself has got a funky and fun vibe to it! Everyone working was super accommodating and kind.   I can't wait to go back... until next time :)",

We had the guacamole and tuna and they were fantastic.  We ordered chicken, shrimp, octopus, and steak tacos for the group. They were all pretty good. I will say it is a little on the pricey side to be honest so we don't come here too often, but definitely worth at least one try.",

I was surprised they couldn't even do just a regular veggie taco with beans, guac, etc. The artichoke tacos also had lemon slices on top which I was not a fan of.

Food is amazing but every time I go here service is sooooo bad!!! Even the chef with the twits in his hair. Just bring us our appetizer and drop it like 3 inches on the table and walk away.

First the concept and design are so cool. Urban chic is you will. Modern and fun. The drinks are some of the best cocktails you can get in the city. But the food, omg the food.. Baja tacos  make me feel like I've been catapulted to the moon and back. The flavors are so intense. Chips and salsa are also a must.",

Then we stopped in on a Sunday afternoon and, to our delight, the place was empty.  We ordered the papas bravas, poke, and 2 tacos each.  I order papas bravas any time it's on the menu and these are among the best I've had - the perfect mix of crunchy potato and delicious sauce that left us wanting more. Neither one of us had ever had a poke bowl but we loved the interesting flavor combo. Surprisingly for a place named Tako, I was least impressed by the tacos. I had the Pastor, which had potential to be delicious but there was way too much pork and not enough pineapple or salsa. In the end, I wished I ordered a second poke bowl instead.",

Previously I would order it off the 1/2 price menu because the price is just not warranted, period. Now I just I won't bother because it's not even good - something changed for the worse. Avoid the Guacamole, it will disappoint your mouth and your wallet!",

I tried four salsa and chips, each salsa had a different flavor/spice entirely. I tried the pork, chicken and steak tacos!

To get a seat at the bar when it opens, it's probably best to get there early and wait outside (expect a line). Despite that, it was so worth it. The food this second time around for me most definitely exceeded my last experience. Seriously, I could eat the items I ordered every single day and not get sick of them. I highly recommend the poke for your appetizer and the bistec tacos for one of your taco choices. The special taco of my visit was a pig ear taco and if that happens to reappear as a special during your visit, I highly recommend it (even if the words \"pig ears\" scare you a bit). Trust me, they're so good!   There's a reason the restaurant is booked for weeks and people stand in line before it even opens. That reason is good food and hip atmosphere. It's a little expensive, but you might find that the quality of food makes it worth the price!",

The coconut was like a refreshing, slightly sweet island drink complete with a flower garnish. The cilantro was spicy, but not overly so. I love spicy tequila cocktails, and this drink did not disappoint. Next we had the guacamole which was a huge serving with lots of cilantro and lots of onion, and it came with lots of warm tortilla chips too. We had it as more of a meal, but it could be a good size appetizer for four. Lastly we and the chorizo fundido.  This comes as an appetizer, but we shared it as a light meal. It comes with with four tortillas, and we still could not finish all the fundido despite how amazingly cheesy & succulent it was. I would order this again. The whole place was festive, fun, and very busy. We enjoyed our dining experience here.",

Second, some of us ask for the Steak tako that is one of the most expensive on the menu. We couldn't eat it, the steak was so hard that we almost choked. They must buy the lowest quality steak in the market. I realized this restaurant only cares to make money, and provides no satisfaction to the customers.

Food: Our table of 5 had the chips and guacamole, queso and potatoes. Everyone had tacos, 4 people had drinks, shared the street corn and funnel cake dessert. Flavorful, some things a little too salty, but maybe that keeps people drinking.

The kitchen is really unique, it's outside facing the streets and there's a bar seating that faces the kitchen. We sat at the bar spots facing the kitchen so we got to see them prep and plate everything, really cool experience that I've never fine before. As for the food, the tacos were so unique and delicious!! We ordered the regular guac which you can build you own; the regular was really tasty. We also ordered the queso, totally recommend it! The chorizo and peppers with the queso was a great combination. My husband got the al pastor tacos and I ordered the beef tongue then we split the tako tacos (octopus). The beef tongue was amazingly tender that I didn't even realize I was eating tongue.  The octopus was soo good, I could eat that every time! I love seafood so it was right up my alley, the octopus was cooked really well, not chewy and the flavors with the octopus were so delicious! Highly recommend this place at the top of your must try in Pittsburgh!",

Also had several salsas as appetizers, and each different style really blew my hair back. Atmosphere pairs perfectly with food, unique and fresh, but not the least bit pretentious or overly fancy. If your looking for fresh, from scratch creations, this is a must try! I would try any and every item on menu. Can't wait to go again!",

As soon as we mentioned we were going to Bakersfield, they ran after us to say a table had suddenly opened. That was a bit interesting, and I have heard others had the same experience. Are they trying to create the perception of popularity? Maybe. It was also super dark in there so I kind of lost track of what time it was. Intentional? Probably.   We ordered drinks and the guac. The guac was great and they brought extra chips when we ran out.   Ordered the Korean taco. Was good but also kind of salty. Tacos were a good size and pretty filling. Would be cool if you could mix and match the kinds. Overall I think worth a visit.",

    "text": "So, my wife and I were visiting beautiful Pittsburgh for the Steelers game. We happened to be there for New Years Eve, we tried getting into restaurants, but they were packed.  We stumbled on this place, TAKO and were told there were only room at the bar, which was perfect for us.  We ordered some beers, were greeted by a very friendly bartender and told of the drinks and how they served their tacos.  My wife had the carnitas tacos (two on an order) and I had the chicken.   So, being Mexican-American (my wife and I) and coming from California, where there are endless taco shops, we didn't expect much from this place, especially in Pittsburgh, PA.  But, we were wrong!!!!!  HOLY SMOKES, so, the tortillas are hand made(can't get better than that), the meats had a wonderful taste to them and were served with salsa, avocado, cilantro, queso fresco(fresh Mexican cheese) and were packed with meat!!!!!!!!!   Some of the BEST TACOS my wife and I have EVER!!! had!!!    Come to find out this restaurant is owned by a chef who also owns two other restaurants in town.  Looks like he did his homework really good on how to perfect a great taco in Pittsburgh.   My wife and I would fly back to Pittsburg (If we were rich, lol) just to eat at this place!! that's how good and fun this place was.   I highly, highly recommend this place for anyone visiting Pittsburgh.  THIS PLACE IS A MUST and coming from two Latino's from Cali, it got 4 thumbs up from us!!!",

    "text": "AMAZINGNESS!!!  My husband and I ate here last Friday.  It was opening week, so they weren't taking reservations but we showed up at opening (5 pm) and got a table no problem.  The cocktails were the best part--they are all unique and many have mezcal (a smoky tequila, YUM!), which is a rare find in PGH.  We split chips and salsa, and each got an order of tacos.  I got the baja tacos (tempura fish) and my husband got the Korean tacos.  Everything was really good.  None of the salsas were too spicy, but they have homemade hot sauce they will bring out to you also, which has a kick.  Everything is made fresh and so delicious!  If I could say anything bad (and I really can't), they aren't many veggie options--there was a mushroom taco, but it had huitlacoche (corn fungus) as part of the plate and I wasn't feeling quite that adventurous. :)  We also shared the tres leches pie for dessert.  It was good--not my favorite dessert ever, but definitely delicious, and the desserts are big enough for two.  I love the decor--nautical meets street art meets gothic cathedral?  It's gorgeous.  We will definitely be back again and again.  Love tako!!!",

My boyfriend and I have been here twice now and have tried the chorizo, mushroom, Korean, and tako (octopus) taco. It's all sooo good. The drink menu is also quite good. I had the El Diablo cocktail (ginger beer, lime, and cassis) and it was refreshing and delicious. My only complaint was that the drink took a really long time to get. I had basically finished all my food and then the server brought over my drink.   Anyways, they're pretty much booked all the time, so if you're hoping to make a reservation, I'd recommend doing that a few weeks in advance for a \"normal\" dinner hour. I was looking about two weeks in advance and only saw reservations for times like 10pm, which may be a normal dinner hour for some, but a bit too late for me. We ended up just going around 6pm and putting our names on the list. They said it would be about an hour, so we went down the street to another place to hang out. They texted me saying they had a table for us in about 45 minutes, so I'd say that wasn't so bad. One of the times we sat at the counter by their open kitchen and it was so fun watching them make the tacos. I kept enthusiastically saying how good the tacos were, so I hope I wasn't annoying them too much. I couldn't help it, they were really that amazing!",

I do get full from the 2 tacos because they are pretty loaded up so wanting more is just me being greedy :) I am not able to drink tequila but I still wanted  a Margarita and the staff was super nice and accommodating about which ones would be best to replace with vodka.

    "text": "The food is an amazing fusion mix of an astonishing number of cultures, with substantial portions. The octopus tacos were amazing, the mushroom ones less so but still good.  I didn't really care for their highly touted \"Street Corn\", though.  It was kind of a strange version of creamed corn, both too spicy and too bland, if that makes any sense; the texture was just kind of weird, and we both opted to send it back.  If something is too spicy for me, then you know it's over the top.  I still want to go back and try other things, and definitely have the octopus tacos again. The drinks were also very good.  Service was fairly good, but a little slow.  My dining companion has a lot of dietary issues, and the waitress seemed a little annoyed by her many questions and need for changes, and our ultimately still having some issues with the food (see \"Street Corn\" above), but did accommodate us.    I actually had to go downstairs a couple of times to get the waitress because things were so slow, and being upstairs, there was no way to flag anyone down. This was definitely not so much fun because I've got mobility issues and use a cane (not to mention that no one should *ever* have to get up to go find the waiter/waitress), but no one ever came upstairs to check on anyone eating there unless they were actually serving something.  We also had to grab one of the other waiters and ask him to go get our waitress.  If you want a regular table, though, you have to sit upstairs, where there are booths.  Downstairs, it is just tall tables with barstool-height seats, or you can sit outside either at a table on the sidewalk or one of just a couple of stools at the window.  That's fine when the weather is good, but neither are an option when it's raining or cold.  The bathroom is wheelchair accessible, but unfortunately, it would be almost impossible to get through the forest of bar tables on the first floor in a wheelchair to even get to it.    There is no way on earth a person in a wheelchair is going to be able to actually eat at any of the tables on the first floor, either, and certainly no way to get to the second floor, which is served only by stairs, as with far too many other Pittsburgh establishments.  Unfortunately, there is also not enough room to install an elevator, so it is what it is.  They really need to put at least one or two regular tables towards the front of the first floor in order to be in compliance with both the ADA and reasonable consideration for the range of clientele who would like to be able to eat there, though.    Even with those, it would be unpleasant to get through the sea of barstools to the restroom in a wheelchair, because no one likes to be eye level with a bunch of other people's knees and crotches, looking up at the underside of tables.    It's not just people in wheelchairs, either; the elderly and otherwise infirm will also have trouble getting upstairs, and those of us who are vertically-challenged will all have trouble with the barstools as well, even if fully mobile.  They are not conducive for almost *anyone* to have a leisurely meal, but truly completely impossible for anyone who is not tall and agile.  It's also freaking *dark* in there, especially upstairs, which is lovely for atmosphere, but makes it very difficult to read the menu, even for people with good vision.  My older visually-impaired cousin and I both had to pull out our phones and use the lights on them, and we both had trouble actually seeing our food.  It's lighter downstairs, but again, there is the problem with the seating there.    I don't know if they have braille menus or not.  I didn't ask, but it seems unlikely, given the lighting situation, which shows no more attention to visual impairments than the seating does to mobility impairments.  It's definitely a trendy place, but the food is really excellent, and there are a whole lot of older and disabled people in this town who are very interested in eating at unusual spots, with plenty of money with which to do so.  Tako just doesn't seem to have taken any of us who are not tall and perfectly fit into consideration at all, which is a really major turnoff.  It's right across the street from Heinz Hall, and is open late, so it's perfect for dining either before or after the theater anywhere in the Cultural District.  We had tickets at Heinz Hall, and had left ourselves a good bit of time, but we did end up being a little rushed, so definitely leave yourself even more extra time than you think you will actually need.  As always, one star off just for being utterly inaccessible, and another mostly for the slow service.",

I made a reservation, and that was a good thing as I saw the average waiting time was about 45 minutes.  We ordered the pre-built vegetarian guacamole and it was absolutely delightful. My friends and I loved it so much that we ordered another one. We went on to have some really amazing cocktails, and I particularly liked my Blue Mango Mai Tai!   All of the tacos were incredible, probably the best I have in the recent past. I ordered the pollo asado which was really nice. What was good was, they could replace meat of any combination with mushrooms and make it vegetarian. For instance, my friend got the carnitas taco with mushrooms instead of pork.   Overall, we would definitely go there again. We liked the location too. The only thing which would be better is if they can reduce the volume of the music down a notch.",

This place is fun -- love the ambiance with its big bulbs, tako/octopus themed play on meaning, crazy religious-Mexican drive-in feeling.  But by New York standards, the food and drink are just good, not great.   The Taco Situation: Tako: It's a bit flat -- the octopus could use a touch more charring, the greens and oil used bring down the overall taste, and you're left wanting more flavor pow! with each bite.  Duck Confit: I didn't love the pairing of duck and hoisin sauce. The sauce took over a bit too much.  Korean: The hoisin sauce took over way too much with the Korean taco. And I couldn't taste any kimchee in there. It didn't have any hints of Korean flavor at all, really.  The Guac Situation: The chef's special crab, mango guac was okay -- could barely taste the crab because the jalepenos were way overpowering. Not to mention those 'penos practically burned my lips off.  When in Pittsburgh, Tako is a perfect stop in if you're looking for a fun vibe and some tequila!  And be sure to ask for Jacen if you sit for food!  Thanks, Yelp, for the good find!",

The drinks look great too, but unfortunately I've been living like a poor college student these days and had to choose one or the other. I think $14 for 2 tacos is a bit much, but, whatta ya gonna do. It's downtown and they can charge these kind of prices. The beef was SO tender and I wish I could have eaten another.

    "text": "My son and I had tickets to see Idina Menzel in concert. We tried to make reservations but found out to get a descent time you have to schedule two weeks out. I stopped over there when it opened with intent of trying to secure a future reservation and was told they would take us at 6:45. Outside there were tables and bar stools each with a sign advising you to check with the restaurant for those tables.  When I met up with my son later on i got a text reminder from the place advising me to confirm or decline my reservation by replying with the appropriate number. The two of us arrived and were seated inside. The place had a vibrant bar scene, was extremely dark, and very noisy.It was also extremely crowded and very hard to read the menu. Directly in front of me was the \"WC\" which I later found out was a unisex bathroom with dark patterned decor.  We were given tap water to drink along with a pitcher (no ice).Our waiter explained to us that Tako is Japanese for \"octopus\" hence that menu item is named as such. My son wanted to try the duck confit tacos and I settled for the mushroom tacos. The waiter gave us a special menu that we had to read next to some religious candle outlining the specials of the day. He was hungry so we ordered the customized  guacamole with mango and tuna belly. It is served with chips. We received that first and it was outstanding! Some of it was extremely spicy but it made a great appetizer.  Our tacos were served on wooden boards. We each got two. My son liked the duck but thought it was a bit sweet. I liked the mushroom tacos but found them a little bland. So I took some of that guacamole and threw it on top of my tacos  to add that needed zest.  Although we were told they had WiFi we were not able to connect to it. We had enough with the chips and tacos so we passed on dessert. My son thought the food was Asian inspired. We received a postcard attached to the check which I thought would serve as a reminder of this place.  My True rating would have been 3 1/2 stars but I normally round up when I can't decide. One word of advice-They are not open Sun and Mon but you can leave a message if you want to make a reservation. They did call me Mon and advised that normally for weekdays reserve two weeks in advance and for weekends a month in advance. I'm not sure if I would have been seated if I had decided to eat when it opens but I think with the popularity of this place it would be wise to make a reservation.",

The tacos are a substantial enough size that you don't feel shortchanged. The only complaint I have is that it is very difficult to get reservations, yet every time I have been there, it seems like multiple tables sit completely unoccupied for long periods of time. I don't know if they just honor reservations for much longer than they should, or what the reason is for that, but for a place that is both very popular and small, it would be helpful if they had a 15 minute policy or something to allow more customers to be seated and served.",

We were lucky enough to snag two spots at the bar without calling ahead for a table, and I think I would have preferred the bar anyways.   The build your own guacamole was tasty and unlike any other offering I've seen in the city. Every cocktail we tried was made perfectly. At places like this, I always am fearful that the cute-and-fancy cocktails are going to be gag-worthingly sweet, but none of them were. The bartenders also know what to recommend based upon your taste profile/preferences. And, they know what they're doing with mezcal.   I ordered the bistec tacos as recommended by one of the bartenders. I was excited for them to arrive but unfortunately the cut of meat I received on them was very fatty. I'm only speaking based off of my one time trying an entree, but if I had to pick Bakersfield tacos or Tako tacos, I would choose Bakersfield.   I still would come back for drinks and guac any day of the week.",

The tacos here are pricey yet quite crafty. The menu features tacos with influences from all over the world. I shared the signature tako taco with my girlfriend. The octopus was cooked perfectly. The other ingredients in the taco complimented the octopus very well.  In addition to tacos, we also shared the tuna tartar and the customized guacamole. There was a bit too much cucumber garnishing the tartar. The cucumber was cut very thin giving it a crispy yet soft texture. Nevertheless, I'd recommend the tartar. The guacamole was very tasteful too. I liked that they offered many ingredients to put in your guacamole which I never would have thought of.",

I am more than willing to spend money on a fancy restaurant, but for what your getting at Tako, i would say it's not worth it.",

We had the crab nachos, guacamole, and wedge salad. The nachos and guacamole were good, what you expect. The wedge salad however I felt had no mexican flavor at all and frankly was full of random herbs on top and 50 different types of seeds. I was expecting a delicious wedge salad but unfortunately it was too 'fancy' for me. Normally i am okay with the price I pay but for this particular restaurant I felt it was extremely pricey. Not to off put anyone though it was mexican food but without authenticity and instead a modern upscale flare, if that's what you're into check this place out.",

I consider myself to have a sensitive palette. Some combinations work and some don't. Sesame seaweed, soy sauce and tuna belly on guacamole was not it. Now, I am not one to complain about tuna belly but that combination was a bit much.   The Korean tacos were fantastic and the variety of textures right down to the pickled cucumber slices(not your average pickle) was truly a party in my mouth. I enjoyed it. The staff was accommodating and the manager knowing we were in town for a short while got us a table even though they were booked out for weeks. Thanks for the great Pittsburgh experience, tako!",

Drinks: Fantastic craft cocktails and a separate menu dedicated to showing what sort of craft mastery can be done with plays on the simple margarita. Oh, and a sufficient selection of sipping tequilas.  Food: You literally can not go wrong ordering here. Pumped up, refined street food. Probably the best Tacos I've ever had, including octopus, beef tongue, steak, and mushroom. The poke, the ceviche, and the chef's selection guacamole were all fantastic appetizers.

    "text": "I had put off writing this review each time Yelp suggests it, because I couldn't figure out how to approach it. So I'm just diving in. Tako is a place that I want to like more than I actually do. Don't get me wrong, I DO like Tako.. but I want to \"OMG WOW I WANT TO EAT HERE EVERYDAY\" love this place, because the menu is interesting and the setting is unique. I think it is because it's such a wildly unusual experience... it's not something I'm going to crave to eat everyday, though I am a fan.  I've been here a few times, twice for dinner and once for brunch/lunch on the weekend. The Friday night visit was my favorite, as they have a DJ and it sets the tone for a gritty, funky feel while you enjoy your dinner and drinks. The vibe I get is elevated street food. This is not your traditional Mexican food - these are complex dishes with a lot of layers which you'll get from the menu.  The guac is always a great option as you can customize to your liking by adding in various things including jalapenos and bacon. I've never been let down by the guac - it's a great thing to share with the table.  I've had a bunch of tacos off the menu, but if you're going as a group I really recommend getting the taco big board - you pick six pairs of tacos for $75. This is a pretty good deal as the tacos are pretty pricey. Again, these are \"gourmet\" tacos so the price is justifiable, but just keep that in mind if you're with a large group!  The margaritas and other drinks are DELICIOUS. They are also pretty pricey, but usually very strong (yay). Overall I do enjoy Tako. I especially like to take friends/guests who are in from out of town, as it's a very cool experience. However, I don't find myself going here frequently because I have a hard time spending this much money on tacos, fancy as they may be. As a taco minimalist, I tend to eat more traditional Mexican - but it's nice to treat yo self from time to time!",

    "text": "Went in with high hopes and left feeling underwhelmed.  My hubby and I waited about 2 months to get a Friday night reservation here. Upon arriving, we were kind of turned off by the atmosphere- there's a DJ playing mind-numbingly loud house music and it's so dark we could barely see our menus. All that aside, we are obsessed with Mexican food and couldn't wait to try this place out.   Our waiter suggested crab guacamole, which sounded awesome, but was $16? And after seeing the small serving size at a table next to us, w opted for the traditional gauc ($11). It was good, not great. We wanted to try a few different tacos but were disappointed to find you can't mix and match, so we just went for it and ordered the octopus, Baja, and mushroom to share. The waiter told my hubby to eat the octopus first because it has the shortest \"shelf life\"... okay, no problem.   Within a few minutes, the fish and mushroom taco boards arrived at our table.. the octopus took another 4-5 minutes or so... kinda hard to eat those ones first! Also- we still hadn't received our drink orders by the time the food arrived. My husband loved the octopus, but the other tacos were just OKAY for both of us. Certainly not the best fish tacos I've had. The mushroom were okay.. Im just not crazy about the type of mushrooms used- they are huge and meaty (which some people might enjoy) but Im just not a fan of the texture.  All in all, the experience was average, or slightly below for an $80 bill. 6 tacos, guacamole and 2 drinks... I'm glad we tried it, but I don't see what all the hype is all about.   Bakersfield continues to be our absolute favorite for Mexican fusion in the Pgh area.",

The food: it was just my boyfriend and I and we couldn't decide which tacos to get so we ended up getting 3 different tacos without any appetizers to split and try a variety. We got the steak, duck, and Korean tacos. The Korean ones were had a bit overpowering of a sauce but the steak and duck were delicious. They definitely didn't skimp on serving the protein, a problem I've run into before. The price for 2 tacos an order is just slightly pricey, but again, not too bad for how much they put in the tacos.",

We came on a Wednesday night and found ourselves having to sit at the bar which was actually a pleasant experience, despite being a group of 3, because the waitresses were very nice! But for anything larger than 3, I would recommend calling ahead.   The atmosphere was very cool, unless you thought too hard about it because the Last Supper, the Kraken, and being locked inside a industrial freezer don't seem to go together.   We started off with the papas bravas and the make-your-own-guac. Both of which were spectacular! The papas bravas was probably my favorite thing we had ordered all night. And, if we weren't gluttons then, we got tacos to top it off.   The Korean tacos were definitely good, spicy and tender. However, the baja tacos were awful, I couldn't even choke it down. The tilapia, which usually has a very mild taste, stunk of a very fishy smell. Maybe it was just that batch of bad tilapia, but our tacos paid the price.   While it is a bit pricey, their prices are not outrageous for the quality (despite the baja tacos) that you get. I would definitely go back!",

Some others had the pineapple jalepeno margarita, and spicy cucumber- nice spice and delish as well.  The tacos- Oh. My. Goodness. The chorizo had a sweet taste to it, with the egg and other fixings, this taco was out of this world. Seriously. My mouth is watering as I describe this to you. The Korean, equally mouth watering.

He explained to me that all of the dishes were well balanced. Yes but... So he said that the mushroom tacos weren't spicy at all. WRONG! I can't comprehend why he couldn't tell me which ingredient was the spice/heat and remove it upon placing my order. I felt he had a script and couldn't deviate from it to honestly answer my questions. The guacamole was tasty and the drinks are fantastic!  The vibe is great and, again, the cocktails are delicious! I can't get over the incredibly spicy tacos.",

    "text": "Believe the hype!  We've been wanting to eat here for a while, but often our plans are last minute and this place is always packed.  We were lucky early last Saturday night and scored a table outside.  It wasn't too cold yet and they had heaters set up.  I love the guacamole - they start with a base and then have a list of items to mix in, sort of like you find at ice cream shops.  We tried blue cheese and mango.  While it was good, the blue cheese was a bit strong for the guac, but that's really our fault for selecting it.  I definitely want to try new combinations.  We had a Poke which is raw (sushi) tuna with delicious lime foam on crispy rice crackers.  A couple of the rice crackers had stuck together and were a tad oily, but it didn't detract from the dish.  At the recommendation of our server we had Korean Beef Tacos.  All I can say is Yum!  The Neville Island Ice Tea was a nice twist on the drinks and I also had a seasonal pumpkin margarita.  While it was good, there wasn't much pumpkin flavor.    Pittsburgh needs more places like this.  Great food, great atmosphere, and reasonable prices.  I can't wait to bring some out of town visitors so they can taste the new Pittsburgh restaurant scene.    Taking in to account atmosphere, quality, and price, this could be the best restaurant in the city.  If there is a downside, its only that the food is so good its always packed.  Be sure to make reservations.",

It's hot, and just creamy enough. We finished every bite.  - Poke: Also an unexpected YES. It comes with fun rice crackers to eat. The poke was good, with interesting bits mixed in.  - Thrice cooked wings: I think these were good, but I honestly don't remember them. - DIY Guacamole: We got the variety that had crab and mango mixed in. I thought it was too weird to keep eating; my coworkers liked it, but it was the last item we finished between the three of us.  - Chorizo tacos: This was really great. The fried egg made it messy to eat, but overall, it was a solid, full taco. - Korean tacos: I liked this! I grew up eating Korean barbecue, and I thought they did a good job with adapting korean flavors in this taco. - Pig ear tacos: I think this was a special. I passed on this, but my coworkers loved it, and said it was the best pig ear dish they'd had.  We got another taco, but unfortunately I don't remember it!  We liked the Grapefruit & Sage margarita, and the frozen rum & banana float cocktail (which was a daily special).   Overall, I felt that tako had a unique, artistic vibe and great food. We ate outside, where we had a view of the sidewalk bar, and the cooks in the front making tacos.",

    "text": "tako is a modern, hip restaurant located in the Cultural District. What appears to be a regular taco place on the outside, is actually a gem in Pittsburgh that's gain lots of traction. The location itself is in a wonderfully bustling part of the city, which brings together a diverse crowd. I made reservations here about a month before my two friends and I dined here and scheduled a time during the week (a Thursday night). We thought there wouldn't be that many people, but the restaurant was busy. Initially, I thought that the restaurant only had one floor of seating, but there's a lovely second floor that's a lot quieter and has comfortable, spacious booths. Though it was a bit loud, my friends and I could still hold a conversation without bordering on yelling. My friends and I decided to order the \"Build Your Own Guac\" as an appetizer and mixed in smoked salmon, green onions, and white onions. The guac was delicious, even with such unusual ingredients, so definitely experiment! A huge highlight of our night were the chips. They were addicting, so it was hard to stop mindlessly munching on them so that we'd have room for our actual meals. My boyfriend and I shared the Korean, Al Pastor, and Bistec tacos. Hands down, the best was the Al Pastor. The flavors were classic mexican but with a fun, unique twist. The Korean and Bistec tacos were good, but my boyfriend and I thought they were a bit too salty. A few little extra tidbits about tako: parking is definitely easy, since there are lots everywhere, service is extremely efficient but never overbearing, and reservations are definitely necessary. Overall, tako is an awesome place to have a great meal and drinks with friends and it's a place any foodie should experience.",

This place was everything I heard it was and more. My wife and I started with their chicken wings...awesome. They are fried three times which creates a super crunchy exterior but keeps the chicken super moist and tender. They are tossed in an Asian fusion sauce which was extremely flavorful. I would be re-missed if I didn't mention the pickled veggies that came with the wings....a nice touch, very flavorful. We also got the make your own Guac, which was very good as well. For our main course my wife got the Carnitas which she said we great and filled with flavor. I chose to go with the Tako Taco. The Octopus was some of the most tender pieces of Octopus I have had with a great compliment of toppings and sauce. For dessert we got the TresLeche cake.....unreal. I'll start by saying TresLeche is our favorite kind of cake and this was on another level. Not only did it have the classic moistness from the milk topping, but they mixed the milk with caramel and cinnamon which just added an amazing depth of flavor.  All in all, loved every course and would definitely recommend you give it a try.",

The highlights:   tacos: octopus, Korean, mushroom; also poke, corn, ceviche - all delicious. Guac was good, but we have had better - lacked salt and life juice, but the fact that you can \"build your own\" is pretty cool and a fresh take on menu and ordering.  Grapefruit margaritas were perfect! When back in Pittsburgh - will def eat here again!",

It was a Monday night, we were able to reserve a table for three at 7 pm for 8:30 pm so the reservation was smooth.   I love the ambiance, the kitchen being open in the front. The seating area, the menu, the service they were all stylish and nice.   We ordered the classic guacamole, the chips were salty and delicious, the hot sauce we asked for was almost as good as the guac. Then we ordered the tacos and I went for the chorizo. It was really good and delicious but didn't really blow my mind. My friends ordered cocktails and they weren't thrilled about their drinks. Overall was a pleasant experience though, will definitely go back to try more of the starters and different guacamole. Just keep the expectations realistic.",

You HAVE to order two tacos at a time which sucks if you want to try a couple different kinds and the people who are with don't want to split something.  So you may end up overspending.  We got a frozen alcoholic drink and it was not good at all.  There were trying too hard to combine a bunch of tastes together and it did not work.  I would come back, but I won't go out of my way. I would much rather go to Smoke in Lawrenceville and get their tacos.",

This place is always packed with people no matter what day of the week it is, and for good reason. All of their entrees are perfect, the platter they bring out when you order a decent amount of tacos is huge! I love when I look up and see it coming towards our table :) their tako taco is the best (yes you read that right) tako taco translated is octopus taco, you can NOT go wrong with this. Love date nights to this place. Their bar is also cool they have a lot of alcohol options and they make a mean margarita. And on a weird note: when you check out this place, go check out the lady's room. They have a very different bathroom lol when you go check it out you will know what I'm talking about :)",

The decor was very cool, a lot of details to match their theme. The lighting was just too dark for our own personal taste and the music was way too loud. So I'm sitting across from my fiance and I can barely see her because of the ultra dim light and I can't hear her because of the loud music. Just not our type of atmosphere we prefer. VERY HIPSTER-ISH. However the food was EXCELLENT just as advertised. We did the chefs choice guacamole and chips for an appetizer. And we had the Al Pastor, Duck, and Korean tacos. That's six tacos total and we were very full by the end. Overall the food is great which is what we came for but we didn't prefer the atmosphere.",

The tacos we ordered are not terribly priced (10 bucks for 2 tacos - they're rather filling) and MAN were they incredible. They're put together like a speciality chef would only assemble, and the Guac. Let's talk about Guac...I honestly can't. There are no words to describe how good the guac there was - actually there is! I can explain it in one sentence. We ordered a bowl of Guac and ate it so fast I ordered another.

As I sat in the small outside bar area, watching the kitchen staff do their thing, I was hoping beyond hope that I would like this place. It was so cute and I love the open kitchen concept.  Thankfully, this was by far the best food I had during that trip, and I thought to myself, \"This'll do. This'll do just fine.\"  The tacos were spectacular. Inventive but more importantly full of flavor, and not incredibly expensive for gourmet tacos.  I came back recently and tried some more tacos (I now find that the Korean tacos and the Al Pastor are my favorite so far), BUT a highlight of my night was the tuna belly guacamole (#2 of the chef specials). So so delicious. A little bit of salty, a little bit of almost sweet, and a lot a bit of umami (I'm not quite sure what umami is but I know it when I taste it!).  Also, try the spicy passionfruit margarita. Sweet but not too sweet, spicy but not too spicy, boozy but not too boozy.  Long story short, tako is amazing, and I plan to be back many times. So glad that there are solid food options in Pittsburgh. Makes me excited to be here :)  (Also, hello Pittsburgh!  I'm new!  Find me good places please :D)",

    "text": "Anyone who knows my Yelp reviewing profile knows that it is biased towards hole in the wall restaurants rather than the trendy places that garner all the attention.  Having said that, I occasionally enjoy checking out the latest trendy spots to see if they live up to the hype that they generate.  I'd walked past Tako with curiosity many times before it opened, so when it finally opened for business this summer, I looked for a chance to check it out.  That chance came when I received comped tickets to see The Wedding Singer musical at the Benedum last night.   When I received the tickets three weeks ago, I talked my friend into checking out Tako with me, and she agreed, so I immediately made a reservation.  Upon entering, we had to wait for about two minutes before we being acknowledged, since the hostess was on the phone and had her back to us.  After that amount of time had passed, another woman came over, checked us in, and led us to our table, which was downstairs across from the bar.  The first thing that was immediately apparent to us was how small, dark, and loud the restaurant is--as others have mentioned, it can be challenging to carry on a conversation here.  The tables are so close together that my friend had to squeeze past our neighbors to get to the booth against the wall, and the service was slightly awkward because the waitstaff came uncomfortably close to our table when they were serving the tables on either side of us.  Speaking of service, while our waiter was generally knowledgeable and helpful, I felt that we sat for a bit too long at several points, continuing the theme from when we walked in.  Together, these factors are the reason why I'm not awarding 5 stars.  Having said that, the food was as amazing as all of the other reviews and my previous experience with Tako's sister restaurant, Meat and Potatoes, led me to believe.  My friend and I started off by sharing an order of queso fundido (cheese dip with chorizo and cilantro; $10), which was extremely rich and flavorful to the point that I felt satiated with slightly less than half of the portion (my friend ate the remainder)--something unheard of for me when it comes to cheese.  For entrees, I ordered the mushroom tacos, and my friend ordered the pollo asado tacos ($10 each).  Because the tacos come two to an order, we each traded one taco with one another so that we could each try both of them.  Both tacos were astoundingly complex in flavor and texture--needless to say, these aren't your typical taco stand tacos!  Although both were excellent, my favorite was the mushroom, which had just the right balance of savory, meaty flavor, vegetable notes, and richness from the sauce.  This is clearly 5 star new Mexican cuisine in terms of flavor--and the tacos are well-portioned and priced, to boot!  Overall, my friend and I really enjoyed Tako.  I'll definitely have to make it back to try the tako (octopus) taco, as well as some of the cocktails, both of which looked intriguing.  If you're like me, and prefer a quieter and brighter atmosphere, you may want to try to sit outside if the weather's nice, rather than in the restaurant itself.  4.5 stars.",

    "text": "I once read that fusion food was just the bastardization of cultures on a plate. Regardless, I'm interested in novel approaches and can always go elsewhere in search of a classic. So, I'm Mexican-American and a brand new transplant from San Diego. This is the very first restaurant I tried to go to, as it was near my hotel and looked happening. Let me preface my review with: I got kicked out. Haha!   Anyway, the first night I wait over 30 minutes for a single seat to open, though there are free seats outside during my entire wait. I'm told if they only seat two people there, that I'm the only one-party and would be sat with them. A two-top is sat, the third stays empty until I leave at the half hour mark. I'm texted to return about 40 minutes later, but let them know I gave up. The second night in town I have a visitor meet me downtown and suggest we give it a try again. I explain the wait, so he suggests we take some \"road sodas\" to sip on while waiting.  Same open seats outside, though this time immediately sat! What luck. (That third seat was still free, BTW.) The hostess does a double take at the drinks in our hands, so we try to finish quick, though it's hard downing red. Anyway, we immediately order red wines, to let them know we're not trying to free load with the BYOB-wait-beverages. We also order Baja and al pastor tacos and ceviche. Everything was extremely too sweet for my liking. They candy the jalapenos and make it into a sweet jam spread with the Baja, the al pastor is like a sweet bbq glaze with fruit and the ceviche also has sweet fruit. Everything was fresh, just none of the heat and salty I look for in these dishes. Anyway, while eating, I finish my wine (my second drink of the night) and ask for another wine. I'm told that I have been cut off because I'm too drunk. Bwaaahahahaha!! Say whaaaa?!! I couldn't even wrap my head around that. I still can't, actually. The kicker is that they continue to serve my friend, who already had several drinks before meeting up with me, plus they served him two drinks there! But I have two wines with food and am told I'm crazy drunk. The server says she's not the only one who thinks I'm too drunk either, looking around. LOL, ok should we play 20 Questions to guess who else thinks I'm wasted? The awesome part is that before any of this transpires, I accidently engage the manager, not knowing who she is, because I liked a piece of jewelery she was wearing. After I'm basically told to leave, I pay, but cannot just walk away. I return to ask to speak to the manager. It's the necklace lady! Anyway, she was polite and couldn't really give an exact instance of me acting inebriated, even while I was talking to her about her necklace earlier. She did mention the wine we brought in at the start of the meal. I agreed that we shouldn't had done that, but they could have just told us we couldn't have our own beverages and not continue to serve the only drunk person in the party. She said they're trained to spot drunk people... kind of missed the mark in this instance, with their laser pointed drunk-o-meter.  Anyway... fusion candied tacos ain't my bag anyway, baby. I'll be looking elsewhere to spend my $$.",

People still have to eat!). Even though we got there roughly 30 minutes before the kitchen closed, the staff didn't seem annoyed at all, and did not rush us to put in our food order. Everything we ordered was sublime! I got the fish tacos and the watermelon basil margarita. The margarita was incredibly refreshing, and not at all too sweet! My friend ordered the beet tostada, which was incredible, and her grapefruit sage margarita was herby and light (though I still preferred mine, if I had to choose). To top it all off, they were able to separate all five of our checks, which is convenient when traveling with a group. The atmosphere was also unique and inviting. I'll definitely try to stop by again the next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "This place blew me away. From the friendly service (cheers to you Damien) to the excellent food (the tako taco was a personal favorite), this restaurant is just amazing. I went with a group of 4 so we were able to get a good cross section of the menu. We started with the poke, thrice cooked wings, and the daily special meat lover nachos. Not only were the portions large and filling (the nachos alone could feed an army!), the flavors were intense. Damien our server recommended combining all the sauces and fish for the poke and the suggestion took the flavors to a whole new level. Just thinking about it, I'm drooling. For our main courses, we sampled the carnitas, al pastor, chorizo, Korean, bistec, baja, and my personal favorite tako tacos. As strange as it sounds to have an octopus taco, the flavors were explosive! Each taco had its own personal flair that made it impossible to compare. But the consensus of the table was that there just wasn't a bad taco. Each was spectacular. For dessert, we had the tapioca with passionfruit sorbet (I wanted to take home a gallon of the sorbet because it was so amazing), the churro with in-house prepared ice cream (a delicious treat), and a cheesecake so fluffy, I couldn't believe it.   The meal was a flavorful roller coaster from start to finish, and if I wasn't so stuffed, I'd get back in line right away. I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Great vibe and service. Kudos as well for the outdoor seating / bar, which was amazing in good weather.  The menu claims to be inspired / based loosely off of Southern California. I can't say it completely hits the mark, but then again, that's a difficult standard to met in a location that's so decidedly inland and distant from either SoCal or Mexico. E.g. the fish in my taco (I got \"BAJA\") was fairly mild -- it tasted best when paired with salsa -- and didn't wow me with freshness. Similarly, the spiciness of everything (even \"hot\" salsa) could've been kicked up a notch.  That said: the combination of flavors, though milder than I would've preferred, was excellent. The atmosphere was fun and relaxed. And as mentioned previously, the service was low-key but friendly. So yes, if you're far from the beach and craving a modern taco, this is a good place to come.",

We had a hard time getting a reservation and for my birthday dinner was sure to call about  3 weeks ahead of time for a reservation-yes  reservations are needed for any day of the week.  Once we arrived we had to wait a bit to be seated but it was cool hanging out in the front watching the master chefs at work (they have the kitchen enclose by glass at the front entrance  For our drinks I went with the red sangria which was delicious-the perfect blend of sweetness. My date got a Mexican beer-they beers are reasonably priced at $5 and my sangria was $8. The margaritas are $10 and not huge. For our appetizer we went with the made to order guacamole. There is so much to choose from so we went with the regular house guc and added a cheese-well what we thought was queso but their queso was some sort of shredded cheese. Not what we expected but very tasty. The chips are great as they are not greasy.  For my entree I went with chicken tacos which had big chunks of avocado, cheese, and salsa. The chicken was grilled to perfect and had the best flavor. You get 2 tacos and I wish it was 3 for the price but they were one of the best tacos I have ever had. My boyfriend had to order 2 types  since the portions are small and went with the steak and pork shoulder. The pork shoulder came with grilled pineapple which added the perfect mix of sweet flavor. The steak taco was a really nice cu of sliced steak grilled to perfection.  This would be 5 stars if not for the price & small portions but so tasty I can't wait to go back.",

We chose the beef and chicken tacos and both were very good, but maybe not the best choices after such distinctive apps.  Next time, I will try something a little more exotic.  The drinks were interesting but approachable. The gin fizz was a great surprise, as was the iced strawberry-line margarita, with bits of fruit in the drink. Very nice touch.  When we arrived 15 min early for our 7:30 reservation, we were seated right away, Our server was extremely knowledgeable and with us at every turn, offering good advice. My only disappointment was minor and overcome by the good food and drink. The restaurant was cool and funky (love), but it was too loud to hear anything and too dark for me to actually read the menu. The decor was cool and I loved it, but a slightly lighter touch on the music and lighting would have made it a better experience for us and several of the diners around us joked about the same issues with us. That said, it was an older crowd on a weeknight, so perhaps that explains it!  But I'd go back in a minute, with my flashlight and megaphone - for the wings!",

The tortillas were Meh, and it almost felt like they were trying to be too edgy and unique with the fusion flavors on the tacos so it was so much going on . We ordered a ton of food because we wanted to try everything  and they were all so heavy, they could even make the tacos smaller so people can experience more. If you have ever had tacos from the west coast these don't even compare . We also got the tres leches cake for dessert which tasted like one of those frozen boxed cakes, we had one bite and left it.",

We were surprisingly able to get right in, which was great because I have heard so much about this place and have never been when I am in town visiting! Although the place is a little dark inside, the ambiance is great! The chandeliers are made of recycled bike chains which is cool, and it has a fun retro feel with the octopus mural on the wall. I always like being able to see into the kitchen, so watching the food being prepped and cooked while we waited for a few minutes was a plus for me.  I had the Bistec tacos, Mezcal Smash, and Pineapple Jalapeno cocktails. The PJ cocktail was not very spicy like I was expecting, but was delicious nonetheless. Everything on the menu looked great and it was hard to choose! If I had a bottomless stomach I would order one of everything all at the same time. I would definitely getting a reservation if you are coming to town and want to check out this place. Last time I was in town we were not able to get it- this time just happened to get lucky and it is worth it. PS- the Mexican Sprite is just regular Sprite bottled in glass, in case anyone was wondering",

Had a very lounge theme, with minimal lighting and loud loud music. Definitely not some place to go for a first date, as it feels very seductive and you wouldn't be able to hear your date at all.   The service was great.  We had a fabulous waiter that was very friendly. The food was really good too. We got the octopus and al pastor tacos. The tacos have a LOT of filling so you will definitely be full from ordering the tacos alone (come in sets of 2). I read a lot of people complaining about the price, which I completely disagree with. Maybe because I am visiting from CA, but I thought the price points were good. The al pastor was $12, thats $6 per taco with very large fillings. The octopus was $18 total but you got a large piece of an octopus tentacle that was so worth it.   The octopus taco was amazing. The octopus was tender and so soft. The sauce was good too.   I thought the al pastor was way too salty. It was very tasty but I thought there was too much going on there, with the spicy sauce and the pineapples. My husband loved it, so to each their own.",

    "text": "I went back and forth a bit on whether to give tako a 4- or 5-star review; I wish there was a 4.5-star option! I made a reservation about a month in advance, which I read was recommended from others who have also left tips/reviews for tako. Our party increased upon arrival and I wasn't able to give advance notice to the restaurant. They did a great job giving us options to get us seated more quickly, or to have a more comfortable place to enjoy our evening. We opted to wait an extra 30 minutes or so past our reservation time for one of the tables upstairs, and I appreciated that the host and hostess were constantly updating us on the status of our wait. Our waiter provided great service throughout the evening as well. He was personable, willing to give recommendations, and put up with our indecision and need to have a few more minutes to continue perusing the menu.  Now for the food... the most important part, right?! The tacos were yummy. There are several types of meat or vegetarian options to choose from, and there are also non-taco items that you can order. Why do that when they are known for their tacos? Here is why I couldn't decide between a 4- or 5-star review. You can't mix or match. Each plate comes with a couple of tacos, but both tacos are the same. What would be awesome is if you could section off the menu so that you can order two or three tacos on a plate and have each one be different. I really wanted to try a couple of different tacos, but at $12 or more a plate, that wasn't an option. There was one \"party\" option that allowed you to order five different tacos (if I remember correctly) and you receive two of each. This is great if you have a group of people who want to split the options. Just wish there was a smaller version of this option available when you can only really eat 2 or 3 tacos in a sitting.  Other than that one thing, tako was great. I think it lives up to the hype. I haven't had the opportunity to find decent Mexican or Tex-Mex style food in and around Pittsburgh. Out of what I have had the opportunity to try, this one is the superior option. It is a really great date night spot as well, or a great place to snag a reservation before going to see a show at a local theater. I would definitely go back.",

The custom guac and pork tacos with pineapple were TO DIE FOR. You absolutely have to have a reservation here for dinner - good luck otherwise. The inside is pretty small so walkins I heard the hostess quoting a 2.5 hour wait time. It's directly next to Butcher in the Rye so if you wanted to grab a drink before or after, it's a great location.   Only negatives - I'm BEYOND obsessed with coconut but their coconut margarita is BEYOND DISGUSTING. It tasted like tequila with milk. Avoid! Also our server was exceedingly slow. It's possible that tables never turn in this place because the servers are so slow BUT the awesome food is almost worth it. Just don't expect a quick dining experience here.",

He loves fish including salmon. I find it odd that a white fish would be so fishy. He never spoke up at the restaurant so I never knew anything was wrong til we got home. He didn't get sick but I wonder if anyone else had the same experience.  The DJ was awesome on Saturday. It was probably the best part as well as our drinks and Jason, our server.

You may have to wait for a table or have a hard time getting in, but it'll be worth it, I assure you. This is an awesome Asian/Mexican fusion taco place with some unique taco combos, customized guacamole with lots of mix-ins, and an outstanding drink menu. My favorites of the night were the chorizo tacos with creamy romesco sauce, carnitas with chicharrones and salsa verde, and the bistec taco, which is made with wagyu beef.   Believe it or not, my favorite thing may have been the drink(s) I ordered - the Spicy Passion Fruit margarita. It's spicy and sweet, made with tequila, passionfruit, lime, orange liquor and habanero. Such a fiery zip! Had more than a few of these.  All in all, worth the stop AND the wait!",

It really is a pretty decent bang for your buck even though at $75 if might not seem that way right away. We each got three tacos total and were able to try all six through split and share. We went with the Korean, the Duck Confit, the Al Pastor, the Carnitas, the Bistec and the Chorizo. All were pretty tasty, and the Chorizo stood out for me in particular. Feeling wealthy, I suppose, we also got the thrice cooked wings and the Queso Fundido. Both were delicious and quite possibly better than the tacos! The Queso Fundido comes with warm tortilla shells so it is definitely my recommended appetizer of choice if the actual tacos are seeming out of price range. Drink selection is amazing as well! Prepare to spend a pretty penny overall, but you will enjoy yourself. Service is pretty good and the atmosphere is perfect for a night out, or even a date night, not really romantic but the perfect combination of lively and chill. Would go again after saving up some money...",

We went there for my husband's birthday and met this wonderful Italian couple from New York. (We had so much fun drinking and laughing with them, we ended up migrating to another bar.......I digress).   The guacamole was \"create your own\" and LOADED with bacon, per our request, which the men devoured. I could not get over the tenderness of the octopus that I ordered, and also could not have been happier with the service. We have tried to go back here several times for lunch, but discovered it's only open beginning early evening hours (maybe that's how they reel you in!). The wings were prepared perfectly, with just the right amount of sauce on them. Another perk was being able to look into the window as the shells were being prepared. Just such a cool place to sit down and eat a great meal and enjoy some awesome company. It's pretty small inside, so I'd definitely call ahead for a table. We would go back here in a heartbeat.",

I'm not sure how the restaurant would know we were 6 guys, so i'll cut them a little slack, but the overall level of comfort-ability really suffered. Sans the tiny tables the lighting a little dark, with a pretty upbeat music selection. Not for everyone, but i enjoyed it.  The pineapple jalapeno  margarita was exceptional. Perfect amounts of both advertised flavors. It's extremely easy to overpower with the jalapeno flavor, so kudos to the barkeep for making this drink as enjoyable as i would've hoped.   The biggest flaw was in the appetizers, specifically the guacamole. When the guac comes out brown, it makes it a little hard for me to really enjoy it. Albeit the taste wasn't as bad as it looked, but those who know guac, know that its brown because it lacked freshness or the proper acidity. I'll go with the former, as the taste was pretty decent. Either way, for tako to have such quality ingredients and preparation for their main courses, the fact that they let the guac go out brown really shocked me.  Main courses were top notch. Ive eaten tacos across the country and the the Duck Confit taco is quite possibly the best taco i've had the pleasure of tasting. Perfectly cooked duck with perfect seasoning and saucing. The garnishes were exactly where they needed to be. The Korean taco was stellar as well, with a great housemade bbq sauce complimenting the perfectly cook pork.  Overall the 4/5 due to the poor guac and the tight table quarters. Would 100% come back.",

    "text": "This place exudes cool.  Glass encloses the kitchen.  The dining area is dim, with octopus on the walls and red light fixtures dangling from the ceiling.  Our uber-hipster waitress explained that tako was Japanese for octopus.    Three of us ordered different tacos.  The winner was the chorizo taco, with the fried egg on top.  I didn't care for the Korean taco; it was way too sweet. On the other hand the choco taco, a desert, wasn't sweet enough.  There's something off with that.  The tacos are expensive by Texas standards. Similar tacos at Austin's Torchy's Tacos, or Velvet Taco in Dallas, run about half as much.  Even the tableside guacamole at Boudro's on San Antonio's Riverwalk is 50% cheaper than it is here.  But there don't seem to be any other fusion taco places around, so I imagine it's OK for Pittsburgh.  I'd try it again at least once.",

Their homemade tortillas are the perfect vehicle for such delicious and fresh ingredients. Since they updated their menu, I am looking forward to going back and trying some of the newer ones. This is a must try spot for people visiting Pgh for sure.",

The drink menu had something for everyone from sweet drinks to spicy options- I got the thai coconut and it was delicious. It was impressive to watch the bartenders make other handcrafted drinks including ones with egg whites! For dinner my friend and I shared the pollo asado and mushroom tacos. The chicken tacos are a classic you can't go wrong with but I much preferred the mushroom. I definitely plan on trying a new type each time I visit and the specials sounded amazing as well. My friend and I plan on coming back with a group to get the taco board in the near future. Highly recommend a stop here if you're look for a more casual dinner but with delicious food.",

    "text": "Perhaps a better tag for this restaurant would be Asian fusion.  Tako, as I remembered after my meal, is the Japanese word for octopus. Their logo is also quite literally an octopus. None of this got through my head as me and my girlfriend dropped by on a cold November night.  \"Sweet, let's get some Mexican food,\" I thought as we rolled in. The dimly lit insides were reminiscent of lounges reserved for Upper West Side New Yorkers, with an atmosphere that is simultaneously sultry and bustling.  Two bar seats and two cocktails later, we were diving into the nori guacamole (highly recommended) and the street corn. Things still haven't clicked in my mind.  The tacos arrived (we ordered two each). I dove into my Carnitas taco, and my Duck taco (still not clicking). The Asian influences on flavor were very strong. Indeed, the duck taco tasted a lot like Peking Duck, but in taco form. Surprisingly, the Carnitas taco also tasted a lot like pork belly. My gf ordered the octopus taco (or tako taco). The octopus had none of the chewiness that was expected; rather, the octopus meat simply disintegrated as you chewed. The flavor was lighter than my orders, and lacked much of the \"seafood\" flavor.  It was only after the bill came around (pricey, but just barely worth it) and after I got a good look at their logo on their coaster that everything began to make sense.  Tako is an Asian fusion taco restaurant.",

I arrived to my party once they were seated and they ordered a few different types of salsas and guacamole and an order of the queso.  I could have just settled on these chips for the entire meal, but I knew I had to have a try at a taco.  I went for the shrimp.  At first I thought it was on the pricier side, but when I saw each taco had 8 pieces of shrimp  it made the price feel a bit more reasonable.  For a drink I had their classic margarita which tasted very fresh and well mixed.   The only reason I am rating this 4 stars is because there was a drip of water coming down from the roof onto me a handful of times for the length of our stay.",

However, they redid the Tako taco- it is terrible!!! Extremely fishy and now deep fried. I have no idea why they would change their menu, especially when it was working. I think the new menu has had an impact on their business because the place was not nearly as busy with many empty seats. You might not need a reservation anymore. Save yourself the heart ache, eat something at home. That's what we'll be doing next time!",

First of all, they removed my favorite taco, the Baja taco :( and the only similar choice is a shrimp taco that costs $17 for a pair. Speaking of which, they've also raised their prices ridiculously high. The octopus (tako) taco now costs over $20, which I think is pretty absurd. Although their food was still good, I think they made some poor decisions in changing their menu pricing. Their business has definitely declined as well - when we were leaving around 730pm on a Friday, there were several empty tables. Hopefully they make some improvements soon!",

They brought out a Tres Laches Cake with a candle since it was my BF's birthday and that was really good as well. Definitely going to become one of our staple restaurants when we're downtown.

    "text": "This review is for take out. I walked in on a sunny day shortly after tako had opened and was able to place an order seamlessly. I thought I would be the first one of the day but there were already a few people ahead of me who had the same idea!   After placing my order, I waited in the entryway for a few minutes. It was nice to have the kitchen at work in front of me - I felt like I was at the aquarium or zoo watching behind a glass. Ha!   I transported my bag of goods home and everything was packaged nicely and unharmed. I had ordered the tako and the chips and salsa (the taco was in a cardboard box, the chips in a paper bag and the salsa in circular plastic containers - all of which are in a paper bag so thumbs up to the packaging materials). I love octopus but have never had it in the form of a taco and given the name of the place I figure I might as well try though it was a tough decision.   The tako was deliciously different - the octopus was probably the meatiest I've ever had in any type of food which was a delightful surprise, the fried beans gave a nice crunch and the person who built the taco you could tell was an expert - they weren't overfilled or too sparse with ingredients, and everything held together perfectly with the right amount of sauce. As for the chips and salsa I thought they were just ok. Just like eating in I received a trio of their salsas and each container was labeled which was a nice touch. The verde salsa was by far my favorite; the other two red salsas were watery so didn't taste like anything but bland mush, particularly the one that is suppose to be spicy which was unfortunate.  However the staff was so friendly and given the overall positive experience, taking out provides a great alternative to when getting a reservation at tako is not possible (and I've tried to make reservations on multiple occasions)! I think one of the major downsides though is finding and paying for parking in Downtown near tako. Also as others have expressed it is not a cheap meal, mine was ~$27.",

Then, for our main course, we split three different types of tacos - the lamb, the duck, and the pollo asado. They were all good, but the lamb was our favorite. The meat was very tender and the flavor from the hummus and the tomatillo sauce was fantastic. I would highly recommend giving tako a try next time you're in downtown Pittsburgh!",

We had a great experience and I'm really looking forward to my next visit!  We started with guacamole and queso. For the guacamole, we chose from the list of offerings (but you can also build your own) and selected the variety with crab meat. It was delicious and so fresh! The queso was a special offering for restaurant week (Tako was offering a daily list of special items in place of the usual prix fixe menu). It was also tasty, though we preferred to dip the tortilla chips (that came with the guacamole) than use the flour tortillas that it was served with.   I selected the carnitas tacos for my entree. The tacos come two per order, but they are HUGE so don't worry about leaving hungry. A generous pile of flavorful braised pork was topped with guac, salsa verde, chicharrones, and topped with cilantro. It was a great combination of flavors.  I washed all of this down with a spicy cucumber margarita, which was cool and refreshing but had a subtle kick. Overall, this was an excellent meal in a really cool space.",

    "text": "This was my third or fourth visit to tako, but the only time I've ever been there during prime weekend hours. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Not because of the food or drink, but because of the way I was treated by the staff, and the poor management of indoor bar seats. I walked in by myself at about 8 PM on a Friday night, hoping to get a drink and a taco before meeting up with some others. I knew I had a small chance of getting a table, so I went in with the mindset of being happy to sit at the bar. When I tried to walk in, the hostess stopped me at the door and asked what I was in need of. When I told her, she sharply told me that there was a waitlist to sit at the outdoor bar and that if I wanted to sit at the indoor bar I would \"just have to wait and see.\" They have tables out on the street too but those were not being used. I went to stand and wait at the bar for a seat, and it was clear that MANY people were using the indoor bar as a place to wait for either an outdoor bar seat or an indoor table. This is totally fine if you are ordering drinks, food, etc., but there were several people just sitting there. I ordered a margarita (very good as always) and informed the bartender that I was waiting on a seat just for me should one become available. As I stood and sipped my margarita for over 30 minutes, hordes of people came into the restaurant, and getting a bar seat became a bit like the hunger games. Still, there were people sitting at the bar seemingly not drinking or eating anything. Another bartender noticed my empty glass and asked if I wanted another. I asked for the check and politely told her that I would have to leave because I hadn't been able to get a seat. She said, \"are you sure? one might open up.\" I am not blaming the bartenders, because I know they were overwhelmed and it can't be easy to kick someone out of the bar if they aren't ordering anything.   Moral of the story? Don't expect to sit anywhere on a Friday night, even if you come alone. Perhaps one solution to this issue would be to employ a waiting list for the indoor bar, too. It's just a small restaurant and the traffic is difficult to control.",

Being an authentic traditional Hispanic, and being born and raised in Los Angeles and Houston, I certainly did not come here expecting to eat real tacos. I went to tako expecting to enjoy good food in a trendy, nice ambience, and I got just that.   These are not authentic tacos by any means. Tacos are not eaten on flour tortillas. Tacos do not contain octopus. Tacos are not $13 a piece. However, this place is not aiming to be an authentic taco place, they are aiming to provide a unique take on tacos, and they do a good job at it! The \"tacos\" are really good! The octopus was my favorite! The ambience is cute and trendy.   I think that's all you need to know. :)",

We started out with a couple of their signature spicy pineapple margarita's (I substitute vodka as I can't do tequila) they were exactly as described and worthy of a second round....  and third.... For food we had the gwok, Poke, street corn, octopus tacos and Korean tacos.   If I were going back I would skip the gwok as it is nothing special, it was good but not better than you can find at most other Mexican restaurants.  The Poke was also good but not amazing.  The street corn was worth EVERY calorie, soooo good.  Tacos were also good.  After looking at what the table next to us ordered if I ever make it back I want to try the chorizo fundido and the steak tacos!",

You can literally order any taco on the menu and you will not go wrong. Imagine a restaurant where every taco you order contains a conglomeration of succulent, juicy, and fine flavors that all come together to create a plate so perfect and extremely satisfying. This is Tako. The only thing not that special is their guacamole.  Some of their cocktails can be on the sweeter side. The servers/waiters are all quick, friendly, and knowledgeable. The atmosphere is great but on the louder side.",

    "text": "This is a different type of taco place. Know that going into this. Tako prides itself with a Asian Fusion creations and honestly I think it misses the mark in some places. Starters: Poke and Chips and Salsa. Both delicious separately, very odd pairing the two together. The Poke was well seasoned with big fish pieces and the chips that come with were crispy and flavorful.    I ordered the large tako sampler, aka the \"board.\" The presentation is flashy and holds small portions. Essentially a large board is filled with 12 tacos, 6 pairs. This fed a party of 5. This option allows you to pick and choose the tacos you want. The steak and the mushroom ones were the most flavorful and by far my favorite.    The carnitas were a little bland, and some of the tacos started blending together with Al Pastor and Pollo Asado. Knowing this is a more upscale place, I had higher expectations for distinct flavors to draw me back. Other competitors are better priced, portioned, and generally impressionable. If you are looking for a fancier, hip dinner, Tako is good to impress out of towners. If you're looking for a good meal and not break your bank, PGH has many better other options.",

Front is where all the tacos are being made It's a glass enclosed kitchen you can watch the chefs at work...it's very cool We arrived and were warmly greeted and seated Downstairs  It's one long padded bench with high tops for two The other side are metal stools The other side is the bar Waitress was friendly and perky we had water instantly  And drink orders quickly taken Guacamole has it's own menu Made fresh there are all sorts of fixins you can add from blue cheese to sausages  Menu had tacos of all sorts including octopus ...octopi seems to be a theme here ...walls are adorned with these sea creatures The is a poke bowl  We ordered plain ol guac it came with warm not to salty warm chips delish  I had salmon tacos  Soft little warm tacos a piece of warm salmon with slaw and some eggplant very tasty  My dining partner had bbq beef she loved I have a thing for light bulbs and the upstairs section has lots of cool all different bulbs as the lighting  The pros . Yum food and great service  The cons the metal stools uncomfortable and the noise level it's pretty darn loud Average 14 dollars for 2 taco is a little pricy considering portion size and food type Parking was difficult this Thursday evening we parked in the garage down the street Side note ...a gentleman sat down at the empty table next to us (there were two) after a few minutes they asked him not to sit there ...his friend had ordered take out taco apparently you can't sit and wait they left the tables were still empty when we left about 15 min later",

My party loved the guacamole and the burrata. Unfortunately, I couldn't eat the guacamole due to spice allergies, my party said the guacamole had a lot of flavors. I had the burrata and it simply melted in my mouth-- tomatoes are in season and it was delicious.   We all had the spring tacos which they offer in both corn and flour. I had the corn and these tacos were really filling. The vegetables on the tacos were mushrooms (which I love), goat cheese, asparagus -- really well balanced and definitely not vegan with the goat cheese and a great sauce that probably had dairy.  I also do love me a frozen margarita, which I had and definitely hit the mark.",

    "text": "Tako: 5 Stars Planted in the cultural district of Downtown Pittsburgh, Tako bills itself as a taco spot with so-cal and asian influences.  As I walked up to the restaurant, this place gave off the vibe that was going to be pretty great.  The kitchen is in the front of the restaurant and fully visible to on-lookers outside and customers inside.  Such a cool feature to see how the tacos were being prepared from start to finish.    Food/Drinks (2 Stars) Drink: Margarita ($10) Coincidentally, I happened to venture out to Tako on National Margarita Day.  So in honor of Margaritas (and Tequila), I opted to order The Classic Margarita.  Fantastic margarita made with corralejo blanco, bauchant orange liquor, lime, and agave nectar.  No complaints from me.    Starter:  Chips and Salsa (3 for $7) My weakness in life is Chips and Salsa, so when offer the opportunity to order Chips and pick 3 Salsas, I leaped at that opportunity.  I ordered Roasted Tomatillo, Peanut, and Smoked Chipotle.  By far, my favorite salsa was the Peanut Salsa.  I could not (and didn't) stop eating it. AMAZING.  The Roasted Tomatillo was delicious, but I was not a fan of the Smoked Chipotle.  Entree:  Tacos, of course  Upon the recommendation of the bartender, a colleague of mine and I order 3 sets of tacos (2 tacos per order), so we could each try one taco apiece. We ordered Al Pastor ($13), Korean ($16), and Bistec ($19). If I had to rank the tacos:  Bistec, Al Pastor, Korean.  The tacos were incredible!! Wow.  I'll brag about the Bistec and tell you what's in it (Only to entice you to order when you come).  The Bistec tacos include asada marinated flat iron steak, salsa borracha, smoked mushrooms, fried shishitos, and queso fresco.  Service (1 Star) We choose to sit at the bar, because it was impossible to get a table.  I didn't catch the name of our bartender, but she was great.  My margarita never hit empty, and she was pretty interesting to talk to which made for a fun night.    Cleanliness (1 Star) No complaints here.  This place was extremely clean.     Ambiance/Atmosphere (1 Star)  As I mentioned when describing Tako, the atmosphere was very cool with the kitchen being fully visible and at the front of the restaurant.    Would I recommend? 100% hell yes",

The tako taco consisted of thick giant rubbery tentacles that had a terrible fish odor as I brought the food to my mouth. To the point that my hand involuntarily stopped moving in a last ditch effort to save me. I took a bite anyway. Shouldn't have. Everything is covered in cream sauces and wilted cabbage. Chips were ok. Korean taco was ok. Not ok enough to ever go back. Go to las Palmas or Bakersfield. Or take someone you're mad to tako and slap them with that rubbery ass tentacle.",

Wonder selection of margaritas as well as other specialty drinks. They do make a good cocktail. As for the food we had guacamole with tuna belly and it was excellent. They have a guacamole menu nice idea. As for the Tako themselves great mix of flavors and as all places some better then others but if you try a new place try something new. The winner last night was the mushroom taco. Absolutely  wonderful. Overall I would say try it you should enjoy. But if you are looking for a quiet place to have dinner this would not be the place.",

The chicken taco was much better and had flavor as well as the queso fundido. However be aware,you would think a place that charges you $10 for a cheese dip would give you at least two orders of tortilla rolls,but they don't, they give you enough for half, then they secretly charge you a $1 when you ask for more.....it's the principle.  We were so disappointed by the exceptional hype the city of Pittsburgh has poured in this place that the mood was set after the flavorless Baja taco.  The el Diablo did not taste like anything special either except that it was a normal margarita that costs $10. I would have rather dumped $70 on mad mex which has more reliable food am that is worth the money.......Or wish that Yo!Rita was still open......or Verde........or I lived closer to Taco Bell. Our waiter was great though..... Extremely disappointed by the hype and how overpriced it is. Also for how annoying it is to make a reservation and how long people wait, the place was 2/3rds full the entire time.",

We shared the duck taco as well as the surf and turf taco that happened to be the special that evening. Both were incredibly tasty but also pretty spicy. My wife and I enjoy spicy food so we were okay, but it might be a bit much for someone who is a bit sensitive.   The only issue we had was with sitting at the outside bar. We did not have any reservations but took a chance. We were told when we go there that it was \"first come first serve\" with the outside tables/bar.  However, that is not necessarily the case. When a couple stood up, we took our seats and were almost immediately questioned by TWO managers if we were supposed to be there. Apparently, \"first come first serve\" means you still have to wait until you get called by the hostess. It doesn't make much sense. A little frustrating, but oh well. It was worth it.",

I was expecting traditional poke with rice but this had a lemony foam and guac at the bottom which was awesome! The mushroom taco had really good flavor but had too much aoli. The grilled octopus was really tender and probably my favorite. Our server Justen was super knowledgeable and friendly. Only downfall is the music is very loud and the table are extremely close together. I felt like I was shouting across the table to my friend! Despite this, the food was incredible and affordable!

On our way there, we got stuck in standstill traffic. We called Tako to make them aware of the issue and they changed our reservation three times! I know how busy they are and this flexibility was immensely appreciated. We were obviously behind schedule once we finally arrived and when we told them we had a show to catch, they continued to be extremely accommodating and kept everything moving quickly.   Once we sat down, we ordered margaritas that were phenomenal. We also started with the chips and salsa and the chorizo fundido. The salsas were all fresh and delicious and the chips were fresh, crunchy and salty - everything a chip should be! I don't even have words for the chorizo fundido. Out of this world. I loved how it was served with fresh flour tortillas.   We shared an order of the shrimp tempura tacos and the bahn mi tacos, which were on special. I loved the extremely unique flavors and appreciated how fresh everything was. Every bite was good from start to finish and I am already dreaming of going back and trying new things!",

I also didn't expect it would take so long to make a taco.    One Korean and one Shrimp Tempura taco at the bar along with some margaritas and street corn.  It was flavorful and fresh, but it felt like they had to go to Korea for my taco.  Maybe 25+ minutes?  The people next to us arrived after us, yet received their chicken tacos first.  We had to ask where our order was because we had to leave for the show.  When they arrived, it didn't allow us much time to enjoy them.  Instead it was a chew and screw kind of deal.    While we were waiting for our tacos, we enjoyed some margaritas.  My grapefruit margarita was very refreshing and perfect for summer!  My husband had the classic which was also quite tasty.  At least we got to sip our drinks instead of having to rush those down too.  If it wasn't for the amount of time it took to actually receive our order, I'd probably give them a 4 star rating.  But when the bill is high and the food takes 25+ minutes for a taco, you receive a 3 star rating.",

    "text": "Not as amazing as I wanted it to be, which is so disappointing!   We've driven past this place so many times coming in and out of town and we LOVE Mexican as well as Tex Mex, so we couldn't wait to try it.  The Good news:  the drinks are amazing.  They have a lot of variety when it comes to drinks both on the margarita front but also when it comes to other mixed drinks.  The passion fruit creme anglaise that came with the churros we ordered for dessert was so good I could have drank it straight.    The not so good news: so the tacos we ordered (pastor) were SO INCREDIBLY OVER SEASONED we removed the majority of the pork to make them tolerable to eat.  Now it should be said that: 1) my husband and I LOVE pork, 2) he LOVES spice/seasoning and it was too much for even him, and 3) the flavor profiles and accompaniments were great, but when you over season the main component to that degree, it sadly brings the whole thing down with it.  Huge bummer because it could have been epic.   The decor was kitschy, it was loud despite not being packed, the tables for anyone who is a party of two and sit inside are by the bar, and the churros were overdone/burnt and in one piece (like someone squirted batter like it was a funnel cake but it's a churro).  There's also not much room-that's why you'll find it hard to make a reservation.  And despite having a reservation, sitting outside means an incremental wait-even at 10pm...   So, go for the drinks, and maybe the dessert.  Know what you're getting into with the tacos (each order contains two tacos by the way and they are a decent size, so I'll totally give them that), and if you can snag a seat outside and watch them co, just go in advance and expect a wait.  Ps-we told them in advance with our reservation we were coming to celebrate a special occasion (anniversary)-nothing was done, so just be aware if you're celebrating there's nothing additional that happens",

Also the seating is quite close to the other tables.   The food is definitely super fresh and I love the open kitchen. The kitchen has a fresh, taco stand vibe. The taco shell itself was great. You can see them making it fresh, and it's a bit chewy and flaky.   The octopus in the taco was good but didn't stand out too much.   I would still recommend tako, but maybe have some moderate expectations and eat outside if you can.",

    "text": "I think this is, without a doubt, the best sit-down Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. Seeing that tako had upwards of 1.5k reviews and holds a solid 4.5 stars, I knew I couldn't not come at least once considering I work in the area. I went way past my hour lunch but no regrets!!! 10/10 would do it again hahaha. Forewarning y'all, this is NOT the place to go if you need to take a quick lunch. My party of 6 waited a good 30-45 minutes before we got seated and food also takes maybe about 15 minutes, but it is seriously so worth it.  We split chips and salsa, and I got two orders of tacos(im a hungry guy).  I got the Baja tacos (tempura fish) the Korean tacos.  Everything was really good.  None of the salsas were too spicy, but they have homemade hot sauce they will bring out to you also, which has a kick.  Everything is made fresh and so delicious!  If I could say anything bad (and I really can't), they aren't many veggie options--there was a mushroom taco, but it had huitlacoche (corn fungus) as part of the plate and I wasn't feeling quite that adventurous. :)  We also shared the tres leches pie for dessert.  It was good--not my favorite dessert ever, but definitely delicious, and the desserts are big enough for two.  I love the decor--nautical meets street art meets gothic cathedral?  It's gorgeous.  We will definitely be back again and again.  Love tako!!!",

    "text": "The place is obviously popular and busy so here is my take.  Food is good in general. Appitzers are good but over priced especially the $14 guac but I understand why. You come here for the tacos, the fresh baked tortillas are a delight. The meat is fresh and flavorful, I had the octopus, waiter recommendation and I was hesitant since I never had octopus before but it was fabulous.    50% of the taste is nice spicy mayo and a good squeeze of lime on top.  The corn is a nice appetizer too!  So why 4 not 5 stars:  On a hot day the restaurant is uncomfortable. When we walked in the host was on the phone so what looked like a shift manager told us that we would have to wait an hour to an hour and a half to be seated and walked away, as we were getting ready to leave the host got off the phone and she was like I have a table for you right now no problem. So either this manager was clueless or he just wanted to get rid of us.  Any I will probably be back for more octopus!",

    "text": "I rarely eat at the same place twice on a trip. I rarely order too much food at a restaurant. Tako somehow checked both these boxes.   This place is really kicking out well-balanced and interesting dishes with distinct and powerful flavors. They are doing something special. I expect to see them on the OAD top gourmet casual of North America list soon enough.   I started with the PAPA BRAVAS with fried potatoes / spicy tomato sauce / garlic aioli /oregano butter. The potatoes were super crisp. The sauce was piquant and bright. The aioli brought savouriness and a pleasant garlic astringency.   The tacos are the star of the show.   I ordered three kinds over two days: Korean, Chicken, and Shrimp.   The tacos come in an ultra-fresh tortilla that is chewy and soft while not distracting from the filling.   All the tacos were unique and delicious.   The Korean bulgogi beef was oyster-saucy, sweet, and super tender. The chicken was well executed, tender. The shrimp tempura was crisp on the outside and juicy/plump/springy on the inside.   All the toppings were intriguing, well-balanced, and fresh. It was at the point where I can't remember all the flavors that were going on in the individual tacos. You'll have to go and try them for yourself.",

Ordered the guacamole and chips + the wedge salad for starters.  Both were good - but the server had clearly put in the wrong table as everything of ours was arriving to the table next to us.  Tacos seemed over priced and nothing that you couldn't get at other tacos places. They lost a star from me for the server not being on his game and the taco prices.",

I was using maps to find the location and was on the opposite side of the street. I almost passed by as I saw a small outside seating area with stools. I was rethinking my options because it was too chilly to eat outside and with our group there wasn't even enough seating. Luckily I discovered the door.   This restaurant is a great example of taking tacos to the next level, maybe even to the top level. I was with several people so we got the board. I had chicken tacos and these were some of the best I have ever had.   We started with chips, salsa and then guac. Next up was the Street Corn. Wow was it flawless, great flavor and spiced perfectly.   I had several Negra Modelo to put out the fire. The portions were large and I left stuffed.",

You don't find that type of dish everywhere and the last place I went with those tacos was Arizona. It's one of the places that actually specializes in this type of taco. The taco was pretty flavorful here but my one critique is that it was very oily and I felt it needed a Crema or something to cut through a lot of the fat. We ordered the house made guacamole which was really fresh and I really enjoyed the chips they were thin and homemade. We ordered the spicy cucumber margarita and the cilantro margarita both were delicious. This location was very busy on a Monday night but we secured a spot at the bar. Very trendy and cute I would be willing to go again and try other tacos!",

For starters, we ordered the guacamole and the papas brava (fried potatoes with spicy tomato sauce / garlic aioli /oregano butter). Both appetizers were very good.   For my entree, I ordered the chicken tacos (Pollo Asado) - they were delicious. They are a little pricey - they were $12 for two small tacos.   For dessert, we split the churros. They were very goos. I would definitely get them again.   Overall I enjoyed my experience at tako. I'd go back for another special occasion.",

Per usual both were on point but the Street Corn with the srirachi mayo was fire!",

They have a small interior and an outdoor street bar and sidewalk tables. Make reservations on the weekend!  I sat at the bar outside which is attached to the kitchen. I got to watch the cooks making everyone's food and got to chat with passers by telling me they liked what I ordered.   I got the tangy yummy street corn. I got the strawberry lemonade Margarita as I was hot. I got the AL Pastor pork shoulder with pineapple tacos which were good. I have a sweet tooth so I would have wanted maybe one more piece of pineapple on mine. I was still hungry and didn't want to go so I tried the churro desert which was homemade cinnamon churros, with berries and coconut sorbet with Carmel suace. This was a light refreshing dessert, not overly heavy.  This was a cool fun place to eat. My service was a little slow because they were getting slammed but I would eat here again!",

    "text": "This place has been so hyped for about a year now that I was so excited to finally have a reservation.  Called on a Friday just to see what the deal was; surprisingly they said they could fit us in for 9:30, but scheduled for 10 days later to get a better time.  Bottom line-(though I think it is a bit overhyped) if you still even have an inkling of wanting to go, make a reservation well ahead of time.   My friend arrived before me and had not been acknowledged to be seated, but once I told he host of our reservation, we were seated right away.  I liked the outdoor seating, but am not sure if weather affects their reservations; there is also a small bar on the outer wall as well as an indoor bar.  My major complaint was that, while it is a small place, there was only 1 bathroom, and not really a lot of room to wait around it (unless there was also 1 upstairs that the waitress I asked neglected to mention).   They have a separate drink list in addition to the margaritas and other regulars on their main menu. If for nothing else, I would definitely go back to try a few other margarita flavors, as they had a very unique selection--I got the aloe/elderflower margarita, which I really enjoyed when comparing to the typical very sweet and fruity flavors offered at other places.    Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. For appetizers he recommended the Poke and the Street corn--we went with the street corn as a friend had also recommended this to me, and while I was not expecting the corn to come out on the cob (making it a bit difficult to eat), it was absolutely delicious, topped in cheese and other spices.  As for the chips and salsa, loved the chips which seemed authentic and the right amount of saltiness, though I felt their salsas were okay.   For my entree I had the carnitas taco, going against getting the Korean as I was recommended.  They were good, juicy and flavorful, but I can't say they were the BEST tacos I've ever had, which is what I was expecting from all the reviews the place gets and it being named Tako and all. If I had gone in with lower expectations maybe I would feel differently.  Ultimately, I would go back; I would love to go back to the bar, I would also go back for the food, but having to wait 2 weeks to get in just doesn't feel right.",

    "text": "This is my first time in Pittsburgh and I yelped for top star rated restaurants in my area. It led me to Tako.   Walking up the store front, it looked very busy. All the tables outside and the bar top seating in front of the cooking area were full. The kitchen is right up in front with seating for about 6. If you decide to sit outside in front of the kitchen, you can enjoy your meal while watching the chefs assemble and prepare everyone's food. We initially thought those were the only seating available bc the door to the actual restaurant on the side of the kitchen didn't look very inviting. I thought it was an employee only door.   We finally walked in after attempting to glance inside for a few minutes and found ourselves in a very dimly lit room with a bar that lined the whole right side of the restaurant, high top tables on all the left and a stairway in the back that led you upstairs to more tables. There were two large red chandeliers that hung from the ceiling and lighting featuring octopus tentacles all along the wall.   At 7pm on a Wednesday night they were all booked up for inside seating until 10pm. The host took down our phone number and told us outside seating will be available in an hour and 15 minutes. We decided to wait since the restaurant was so highly rated and there was a car show outside that night that could keep us entertained.   An hour later, we were back after a text from the restaurant and we were actually seated inside. Since it was so dark inside, I actually had a hard time helping myself into my high top seating. I swear I was going to step on the wrong thing and fall.   After struggling into my seat, the waiter greeted us quickly and handed us two newspapers and 2 sheets of papers. Their menu is actually printed on the newspaper and one sheet of paper had the choices for your personalized guac and the other had their specialty cocktails and food specials. We ordered the #5 off the guac menu which was a crab meat guacamole with mango and we added pepitos to give it a nice kick. The guac came quickly with freshly fried chips. The chips were not greasy at all and the crab meat blending very well with the taste of the avocados.  The taste of the mangos were very light, it just gave the guac a nice hint of sweetness. Only thing was, they can be a bit heavy handed with the salt.   We also order grilled tuna tacos, Korean short rib tacos and chicken asada tacos. 2 to an order and we liked the tuna and Korean short rib the best. The tuna was perfectly seared with spicy mayo drizzled on top. And the short rib tacos was made a thick sauce on a bed of lightly pickled veggies. I do have to say, those were a bit salty also. The chicken tacos were good too but the other two just had the perfect combo for your taste buds.   We were too full to get dessert but fiance got a mule and I had a sip. Was a bit sweeter than most mules but you can taste the fresh lime juice with the ginger beer. I liked the sweetness so it was good to me.   One guac, 6 tacos and a mule came out to $86 which is a bit expensive for tacos but I guess you're also paying for the ambience and decor.   Oh and the music choice was quite interesting too. Drake and the Weeknd... don't get me wrong, I loved the music. Just not the music I thought they would play for such a hipster-ish type establishment.   And sorry it was too dark to get pictures of the food. Didn't want to be that one person to make the whole place light up bc of the flash on my phone.",

We had the customized guac (great options for add-ins) and then shared both the chorizo and the pulled pork tacos. Both were great, but I went back for the pork! The meat was done very well.. plenty of flavor!  I've since been back to share the awesomeness with my family and again everyone left pleased! They get quiet busy, but the online reservation system made it very easy to book a table for after a cultural trust show!  I'd also suggest trying to get there right as they open on a beautiful PGH day, we sat outside at the bar on the sidewalk and it was fun to watch the kitchen prep the food and feel like you could still have a conversation!",

    "text": "One of the many wonderful things that Pittsburgh has built up, is its food scene. Around the time that I was moving to Pittsburgh, was also a time when folks were starting to spend more evenings venturing in-between the buildings that make up the Pittsburgh skyline. What they found was a strong sense of creativity and collaboration among the many dining options available. And, at the same time that downtown became a dwelling spot for diners and drinkers, a new restaurant opened up that caught people's attention and captured their imagination with all the things that Pittsburgh was and will be. Tako, located on Penn Avenue in the Cultural District, is a testament of the simplicity and innovation that makes up Pittsburgh. Simply enough, Tako serves tacos...but, it does so much more than that. What Tako is, is a combination of ideas, flavors, and ambiance that leaves you satisfied with the simplicity of it all. When you walk into Tako, you will notice that the space is dark and fairly small, creating an intimate vibe. At the same time, you realize that there is a live D.J. playing upbeat tunes in the corner, which makes you feel like you are at food and music venue in Austin or a bar in LA's Beverly Grove. When you sit down you will be given a newspaper style menu where you will find a plethora of headline specialty tacos. The flavors here come across as \"old-world ingredients meet citrus and chili combinations\". It's nothing that you haven't heard of before but every new blend that you want to try. The tacos will come out on wooden boards in pairs of 2. They are huge and loaded with goodness. The first time I ate at Tako, I made the mistake of getting way too excited over the \"build your own guacamole\" appetizer. It is definitely something to get excited about but, keep in mind that there will be more to come! If you do find yourself with leftovers, don't worry - the servers have this great way of boxing your tacos up so that when you go to eat them the next day for lunch (or breakfast), your tacos are still intact. Being vegetarian, I was extremely happy with the mushroom tacos. Packed with flavor and texture, they were so hearty for being mushrooms. And the sauce on top... the perfect match between creamy and spicy.  When you eat at Tako you will be transported into a whole new world and your taste buds will never be the same. You may even forget that you are in downtown Pittsburgh, becoming engulfed in the environment around you. As you leave the restaurant, however, and step out onto Penn avenue with a full stomach,  it may occur to you how simple of a concept taco's are and how Tako took a modest concept and made it something brilliant. This is a great example of the revival of Pittsburgh: simple, yet bursting with flavor; True to its roots, yet never failing to seek out creativity.   Enjoy!  Xoxo, A  (a California girl living in Pittsburgh on purpose)",

We added mango and peppers! I wish other places put mango in their guac!   For the 2 of use, we ordered the korean tacos and the chorizo tacos! Both were very filling and awesome! I am not the biggest fan of eggs, but the fried egg on the chorizo taco was great!  They also make fun drinks- everything has tequila in it, and my tequila hating boyfriend found a drink that he likes!  This is a fun new place in downtown. I like the idea of the outside bar on the street. We went on a Friday night. There a dj playing music, which was interesting. It made for a very loud setting. I don't think my parents would have enjoyed that. I was thinking it was their way to speed up the customers since it was so new, had a booked night, and plenty of walk ups!",

When I was there, they had 2 different alcoholic slushy drinks, and I ordered one of those and it was phenomenal.   The tacos were very good; they look smaller when you see them on other's plates but are actually a really good size.  I also ordered a really good queso appetizer which was very good as well.   I would definitely recommend checking this place out!",

    "text": "Lovely atmosphere and service, pleasantly surprised by how good the tacos were, and decent size for what you pay, unlike other taco places around town (looking at you, Round Corner Cantina).   My friend wanted to check this place out for their restaurant week special, so we went late on a Wednesday night. I was surprised that at 9pm on a Wednesday this place was full and lively, but I suspect that is because of restaurant week. The special was chips and salsa, a small plate, and two orders of tacos (4 total, 2 per order) for $35. Seeing as to how we were going to split the bill, we decided it was perfect treat!  As mentioned above, I was surprised that a place this hyped up on Yelp actually met my expectations, especially given that it's a fancy place that has jumped on a new trend (tacos, much like the burger renaissance Pittsburgh experienced years ago). The traditional guac (+ cucumbers for texture--GREAT DECISION) was DELISH. Exactly what traditional guac should be. Chips were decent, and the tomato based salsa was bursting full of flavor and really good. The green stuff was not so good, but I'll get to that later.  We ordered the al pastor tacos and chorizo tacos and split them so that we each had one. I freaking love chorizo, and I freaking loved that taco. It had an egg on it, and it was like the best breakfast taco I've ever had and the sauce was spectacular! The al pastor has always been a personal favorite of mine, and tako knocked it out of the park. Very flavorful, grill marks on point, and again a unique and great sauce to accompany it.   Service was attentive without being overbearing, but we were a low maintenance table and didn't require much.   Overall the meal and experience was good! A few things to dock a star for:  The entrance is not clearly marked, and the front door looks like the door to a walk-in refrigerator. Seeing as to how the kitchen is open glass for the public to see, I thought we were accidentally walking into the kitchen, as the people at the hostess stand had their backs to us. As cool, funky, and trendy as the place is, they aren't above needing clear signage as to where the damn door is.   Our table was directly across from the one person bathroom. While there was (thankfully) no gross smell, the layout of the area (table, lockers, stairwell, server station, and door to the back of the house) caused it to seem a bit jammed up at times and was distracting. Space is crucial and I didn't need a need for them to take up an entire wall of valuable space with non-functioning lockers.  Given how great this meal was, I am appalled at how incredibly lacking of flavor the salsa verde was. It literally tasted like nothing. No salt, no pepper, garlic, cumin, flavor, ANYTHING. It was odd because the red salsa was FANTASTIC, but the salsa verde literally tasted as if they blended up the tomatillos and poured it into a fancy jar. So so so so so so so so so confusing and I'm assuming it was simply an overlooked batch because the flavors of everything else were above and beyond. I'll be back for everything but the green watery anomaly that they call salsa verde.",

    "text": "Having been to, and subsequently fallen in love with chef Richard DeShantz' two other offerings in downtown (i.e. Butcher and the Rye, Meat and Potatoes) AND after waiting two weeks on the waitlist, expectations were no doubt set high for DeShantz' third installment, Tako. Boy, were my expectations exceeded.  ATMOSPHERE: 5/5 Tucked away between the aforementioned Butcher and the Rye and a corner CVS and across the street from the beautiful Heinz Hall, Tako illuminates the area with a vintage sign proclaiming their offerings: beer, tequila, A/C, and tacos. Directly underneath the sign is a unique sight for downtown, with a street-front kitchen and 5 stools for guests to sit at should they prefer to dine along the bustling 6th ave. Once inside, restaurant-goers will be delighted by the eclectic decor of the place: marquee letter signs spelling out TEQUILA, a giant octopus (tako means octopus in japanese) mural, and a second floor lined with beautiful Spanish railing, all dimly lit by an array of quirky edison bulbs and velvet colored chandeliers. The open kitchen and and impressive tequila bar surround the place and ensure that, no matter where you sit, there's always something to look at. Even if you arrive earlier than the rest of your party, it's nice to simply sit and enjoy the ambiance.  LIBATIONS: 5/5 As a big time tequila drinker, I was ecstatic at the site of the large selection of tequilas and mezcals that Tako offers. I ordered a glass of mezcal after the waiter helped me choose one I haven't tried from their unique collection. My girlfriend ordered their 'El Diablo' margarita and it was a perfect mix of sweet and spice. I'll have to come back to try some of their other creative cocktails, the woman at the table next to us told us she was loving her Oaxaca Old Fashioned.  FOOD: 5/5 We ordered the obligatory guac & chips to start, opting to build our own with mango, bacon, cotija cheese, sesame and pumpkin seeds. The guac was no doubt delicious, and our ingredient choices were spot on despite some hesitance on our part, since there were so many toppings to choose from. I would have preferred more avocado personally :)  Next was a special of the night, duck quesadillas. It came no sooner than we had finished our guac. Topped with mole and quacking good, these little guys made for a great appetizer.  Once done with our appetizer, our two taco orders arrived. Served on a giant wooden slab with the restaurant's name etched into it and a gutter in the middle to keep the massive tacos together, the presentation was impeccable. The first taco was the Korean. Very similar in flavor to a Chinese chicken salad (replace the chicken with juicy wagyu of course), sweet savory and a hint of spice. The next taco was the chorizo, which I was less fond of since I have a very very low spice tolerance. The egg on top was a nice, slightly sweet addition. My girlfriend loved both however so those who can handle a bit of heat can't go wrong.   Overall it was a great experience as one would expect from this class of restaurants. Looking forward to coming back.",

This is the best meal I've had in 6 months, and immediately became one of my favorite food joints in the city.",

I won't go on a big rant but once a menu is thrown at you and your date by a bartender things start going downhill pretty fast. Chips and salsa weren't bad but the chips were a little salty. I ordered the tacos names Tako and I almost choked on the off taste of dirty/old cilantro. The Korean tacos also were heavy on the salt, kinda took away from the taste. All in all I hoped it would be a little better seeing how it was $18 for two tacos. Went down the street to a food truck and had great tacos for 2.50.lol",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Saturday evening with my wife and another couple for dinner.  We had tried to make weekend reservations to Tako a couple of times before with no luck.  The attempts were made a couple weeks in advance and while there were times available, they always seemed to be after 9 pm. As a matter of a fact I found the whole calling this place for reservations to be silly as the person on the other end always seemed to be next to a DJ booth.  So while I was in a perfectly quiet environment I was forced to scream to be heard.  Why can't they just use some sort of online system?  I digress though and so my wife and I found ourselves outside of Tako at 5 PM as it was opening.  Thankfully we were the last party able to secure a non reservation table and we were led upstairs to the farthest table against the wall.  So while I walked through the whole restaurant I don't know that I saw as much as I should have.  On your way in you can see the kitchen and there are actually a couple of seats outside the restaurant on the sidewalk that act as a \"chefs table\".  They also have some crazy colored bathrooms which I didn't use and then each table seemed to have an odd religious candle on it.  For dinner my wife and I decided to split the poke for our appetizer which was big eye tuna, seaweed and rice crackers that came with what I thought was a lime crema. I can't say that it was really what I expected as it felt like a play on ceviche.  The tuna was raw but I really enjoyed it whenever I dipped it into the slightly tart lime sauce.  Then for our dinners I went with the duck confit tacos while my wife went with the Tako tacos. My tacos came with the duck, cucumber, scallions, pickled peppers, hoisin, cilantro and mint while my wife's consisted of grilled octopus, Harissa aioli, lemons and pickled red onion.  She enjoyed hers immensely and told me that she could eat a whole plate of the grilled octopus that was inside.  My tacos were also pretty good and I loved all the accompaniments to them but I have definitely had better duck confit before.  The bottom line for me is that I would head here again in the future.  I look forward to trying more of their delicious tacos and hopefully the next time I am able to procure a reservation.",

The frozen cocktail was refreshing. The desert lilly wasn't too sweet and had lovely floral and citrus undertones and paired well with our meal. They have a frozen drink du jour.   We couldn't decide whether to do make your own guacamole or do the three course. Eventually we decided on the three course dinner with the papas gravas and glad we did. Great sauce and a healthy portion- enough for two to split with a couple pieces left over. We sat outside and watched the make your own guac so we'll definitely be back for that.  The pollo and mushroom tacos were amazing. Definitely get the mushroom you won't be disappointed.  After all this food we were stuffed.

Lo and behold, a table opened up and we were able to sit down. Thank goodness, because this place is busy and very cramped quarters. Pretty dark, noisy, and nifty decor. We started with the pineapple/jalapeno margarita and a Mexican coke. We also ordered some queso fundido - and oh man was it awful. Terrible cheese that was not any cheese we've ever had - we've been having bad luck with queso fundido - what gives?! So bad, considering our tacos were amazing. Tried the bistek and carnitas tacos, as well as something with apricot -very yummy. So, go for the tacos and the drinks but stay away from the cheese. Yuck!

I've moved on to getting the chips and salsa every time, and I must say the green salsa is divine. You also get free refills of fresh, piping hot chips, a huge plus. I like the Korean tacos just as much as the Al Pastor variety, and the Chorizo ones would make great breakfast tacos as well.

I'm glad they were because this place is a gem! The decor is quirky and cute. They blast '90's-2000's hip hop (yes it's loud. Not my boyfriend's cup of tea but it's my favorite and i danced in my seat the whole time ). The margaritas were fantastic. I had the Thai coconut milk one and the pineapple jalapeno. Bf even commented that the pineapple jalapeno was one of the best margaritas he's ever tasted, and he has traveled far and wide! And the food. OMG the food. We went straight for the tacos. Each order comes with 2 tacos and we got 4 orders (ordered from my favorite to least favorite): Korean short rib, duck confit, the Tako (octopus), and the chorizo. For reference, even my least favorite was the best taco I had ever had up until that point. I'm here in Pittsburgh for a wedding and I'm not sure when I'll be back...so I'm going to try to get into this place one more time this weekend just in case it will be awhile until I return!",

    "text": "My mushroom taco knocked my socks off, but the restaurant struck me as pretentious. There is no reason any Pittsburgh restaurant needs a DJ in a full-on, club-style DJ cage, and music so loud that all dinner conversation devolves into a frustrating game of charades because speaking words is impossible.  Like Butcher and the Rye, the too-squished-together tables at tako intensify the awkwardness of the meal and difficulty of all communications with both your dinner partner and the wait staff.  I've enjoyed Deshantz's other restaurants, especially Meat and Potatoes, but tako seems more concerned with being trendy in da Club than with making a comfortable dining experience.",

I've been to tako about 10 times since they have opened, and sadly I feel like my last 2-3 visits were subpar at best.  Ive always loved the margaritas here- and have tried just about all of them, but the last time I was there they took one of my favorites off of the menu and the grapefruit and sage margarita that has always been my favorite tasted very different.  One of my other favorites is the street corn in a bowl.  We would dip chips into it and it was always fantastic.  The last few times I was there they were serving it on the cob and it wasn't nearly as good. And I feel as though the tacos have just slowing going downhill as well.  The staff here are always very friendly and provide great service, which is part of the reason I am still giving 3 stars.  I probably won't be returning anytime soon, but sure hope tako can improve some of these things because it definitely used to be one of my favorites!",

    "text": "I recently gave Tako 5 stars and a glowing review, but I am SO sad that I may not be able to return to Tako anytime soon. I have been there so many times and the food is AMAZING, but my friends and I had such a horrible experience last night. I really can't remember ever being treated so rudely.  We stopped in after Light Up Night to check out the late night menu. The hostess was wonderful and managed to find a table for the 6 of us rather quickly.  Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. Our server, Chelsea, seemed \"annoyed\" with us from the moment we sat down. It was 12:20am and she kept telling us that the kitchen wasn't quite ready yet, so we ordered drinks. We were confused, though, because the 2 tables on either side of us had already ordered.   When we finally did order, we ordered a ton of food for the 6 of us, so we asked for some small plates to share. Chelsea looked so annoyed that we had asked and replied \"I guess.\"  It just continued from there. I'm not sure what we did to annoy her, but every time we asked for something (extra napkins, more water), she would roll her eyes or have an angry look on her face. It was very uncomfortable for us.  The last straw was when we asked for a box to take the rest of our tacos home.  Chelsea got visibly angry and said \"we do not give boxes for the late night menu, you'll have to use one of the paper baskets that we served them in\" then she walked away. We were FLOORED! When she returned, we said we just wanted something to wrap the tacos in - even just a piece of foil. She replied \"typically, we do not give take out boxes for the late night menu because the cost of the items is so low, but I will see what I can do.\" The look of contempt on her face as she said this is what pushed me over the edge.  I worked as a server for 20 years of my life and I would have never treated customers so rudely.    It was then that we decided to talk to the manager, something I very rarely do. We explained the above situation and at first he was very kind. He told us that this was his first night on the late night shift and that he didn't want us to leave angry, so he offered us a gift card.  We told him we didn't want that, we just wanted him to know how rudely we had been treated.  He then started to make excuses for Chelsea, saying it had been a long night for everyone and that sometimes the transition from the regular menu to the late night menu is tough. This really disappointed us. I know it was a long night, but it was Chelsea's JOB to serve us and provide a pleasant experience for us, which she did NOT do. I'm sure that there are hundreds of people out there that would kill for her job and, in return, treat customers as they should be treated. It is sad, but True, that a server can make or break your experience and, unfortunately, Chelsea broke this one for us.   As I have said, the food is AMAZING and I have had so many great experiences there, so don't let this review keep you from going to Tako. You just may want to beware if you get Chelsea as your server.",

Our server was great with suggestions (both cocktails and food). They offer a truly unique guacamole where you select items to mix in (I added duck and it was awesome). I had pork tacos and my date the octopus tacos. We both loved it! However, it is the ambiance that truly makes this place great. Whether you're sitting outside at the window or inside where you can marvel at the tentacle fixtures, you will have a great time. Many thanks to the bartender at another establishment that recommended it.",

And man was it worth it, we got the street corn along with chorizo tacos. BOTH WERE INCREDIBLE. Definitely a bit more pricey than we were planning on spending but trust me, it's such a unique spot. The music they have going kept me sticking around to be honest. The only complaint I have is that we couldn't help but feel Unwelcome. People that worked there could care less about us, we got lots of ugly stares. The owner personally got us a table (after we were told we couldn't get in, he literally just made it happen) which was very kind. Everything else was amazing, and honestly people are the least of my worries... but that's just me (which is why the 5 stars are still there).",

    "text": "I absolutely love food. And so do you, that's why you're reading these reviews isn't it? As a reservation is not easily had, plan to go on the early or late end and it's a short wait for the bar that serves full menu and spot on cocktails. Take the grapefruit sage margaritas for example. So damn drinkable it's a bit frightening.   Pair that with exquisite cuisine, it's entirely next level. The place made such an impression we were back two nights after our initial visit before we had to skip town. We thoroughly enjoyed sampling their creations, including the lamb, mushroom, Korean short rib, and tako (octopus). The gamut were well executed with various textures in each that were just perfect. But let's be clear, one stands above them all EASILY. It's the Tako ... it's up there with one of the most flavorful bites I can remember. The mushroom was a perfect change up as was the Korean. The lamb came up 4th in our ranking, but still so very good, just not quite as tender as the others. Do yourself a favor and belly up to their well-tended bar soon. This out-of-towner will indeed be quite jealous. PS. Did I neglect to mention the tortillas are made on site and flattop heated tisoft and golden? How dare I.   Well after the glowing review from a year ago we of course came back the next chance we got. The cocktails were still as we remembered, but the octopus tacos were not. The portion of octopus was disappointing compared to our last experience. Instead of tender, flavorful octopus with each bite, this time was mostly filler that included a watery mess that ran out of the taco, all over the serving board and onto the table. Sloppy execution to say the least. Wouldn't have come back if this had been our first experience. Thankfully we tried branching out and got the wings, which were the clear winner this time around.",

Seriously, it works, and it's sexily done. We sat upstairs and I especially appreciated the huge portrait of Jesus and his disciples behind me and the huger portrait of an octopus to my left.  I loved everything that I ate and drank here, and I didn't even get the most popular items.  For an appetizer, we had the street corn (sriracha mayo / chili / lime / cotija cheese): With an intensely flavorful and tangy quality, this was probably the best street corn I've ever had.  And the poke (yellowfin tuna / spicy soy dressing / sesame mayo / lime / rice crackers) was the most creative take on the dish that I've had. Just the look of the dish is revolutionary. On the left side, you have your standard fresh bites of fish topped with nice creamy bits of sesame-flavored mayonnaise. And on the right? It's a tart, lemony foam. Then, just when you think you have this dish all figured out, you find a hidden bed of silky guacamole at the bottom of the bowl. It's all awesome.  I sampled a number of the cocktails, but ordered the lychee and pepper margarita (mezcal / lychee / bauchant orange liquor / pickled thai chilis / lime). This wasn't groundbreaking, but it was very good. A nice balance of heat and sweet lychee. Yay!",

Additionally, I wasn't a fan of the taco because the ingredients weren't authentic to Mexican cuisine, but rather exotic and too rich for my taste. Will consider coming back only if the menu has more veggie taco options.   If you're looking for cheap, high quality 5-star taco joint in Pittsburgh downtown, I recommend Condado.",

    "text": "When I saw the octopus tentacles on the bottom of the name, I was intrigued. My son and I love street-style tacos. This place seemed like it would be the ish. We were not disappointed. The indoor/outdoor style is tre cool. Since it was a nice day, the outside was full. We booked  a reservation an hour ahead of our visit on a Sunday night. We arrived early and asked if we could be seated. The host was accomodating and we were seated. There is a high banquette against the wall with high seats facing, which makes tako a good place for dates. The interior is cool with murals high on the walls and Jules Verne octopus tentacle sconces. Music was deep track classic rock that added to the ambiance.   There was a bahn mi taco on the specials list that my son and I both wanted. We decided to split that and a korean barbeque taco. I also ordered a grapefruit margarita with mezcal. My drink was excellent. They added a bay leaf a garnish which pairs well with the smoky mezcal. I finished my drink before our food arrived. I told my son that is a sign the kitchen is in the weeds. Almost immediately, the host stopped by and apologized for the wait. He asked if he could get us anything implying that it would be on house. I ask for a basket of chips and salsa. He brought them and they were complimentary. Our food arrived almost immediately afterward. Both tacos were excellent but the bahn mi was the best. It was just like the Vietnamese sandwich but a taco. My son says the bahn mi makes a good case for colonialism. I shook my head, embarrassed. The pork was tender and succulent. The beef on the korean barbeque was a little crip, as if it had been on the grill too long or had too much carmelized sugar. The combination of flavors was good. I would have thought the korean barbeque was good if I had not compared it to the bahn mi.   Loved tako. Look forward to tasting the rest of the menu with my wife.",

    "text": "I hate to be that dissenting person, but the only thing I got from tako was incredible overpriced average food and short-term deafness.  I have wanted to try them for quite some time, being a taco lover, but after our lackluster experience I wouldn't recommend it.    We stopped in after the Pirate's defeated the Chicago cubs late on a Saturday night.  Even though it was late the place was still pretty busy.  There was a table available and we were seated.  Immediately I started to loathe the fact that I felt like I was stuck in a pretentious dance club so loud and full of strobe lights.  This is not my scene.   I can't hear my husband who is an arm's length away, as is the other patrons next to us as the table set-ups are very in line with their other restaurants meaning communal and crowded.        I decided on the duck confit tacos, and my husband chose the pollo tacos.  We each ordered one beer and waited.  The wait wasn't long but when you are incredible uncomfortable it seemed to drag on.  When our food came out I was pretty surprised that it came with no sides.  So $7.00 for a taco ($14.00 for two) that I ate in 3 bites.  I swapped my last taco with my husbands and enjoyed his more as I found the duck to be overly greasy and so, so, so, not worth the hefty price for a taco, especially with no sides.    We left, still hungry, a little deaf, and light almost $50.00 for four tacos and two beers.  Maybe we ordered the wrong thing, but even so the atmosphere with the blaring DJ and the lights is not the ambiance I care to experience while dining.  Too many other great places around to waste my money and damage my hearing to come here again.",

    "text": "This is more of a 2-1/2 rating because my chicken taco was good but it wasn't worth the price.  This is more of 2-1/2 because it was late on a Saturday night when we got here and I would think it would be different during the daytime hours.   We have wanted to try out this restaurant for a while now.  The problem we have had is you need a reservation usually on the weekends for Tako and we usually want to come here last minute so you really need to plan ahead.   This time was no different because we got here after 11pm coming back from a Pirates game on a Saturday night.       Just walking up to Tako you can see that it was packed and jamming with music!  We walked up and the hostess said that we can try to go to the bar or have a seat.  He said he had a table for us so we got a seat because the bar was full.       It was loud in there sounded like a club.  I'm thinking that it was only like this because it was late Saturday night but it was jumping!       We got the menu and looked at the drinks first.  We got two beers but we weren't' that impressed with their drink or food menu.   We were hungry so tacos sounded good for the night.  I ordered the Pollo Asado and my wife got the Duck Confit.         When our food got here were dove right into our tacos but we noticed that it was small.  We got 2 tacos for $14 and nothing else.  I know we are downtown and things are expensive but we have gotten tacos at other restaurants in the city and received a lot more food for about the same price.  I did like my chicken tacos though but my wife did not like her Duck.  She ate my other taco and I ate her duck.  She was right it wasn't too flavorful and greasy.  My taco was very good but it should have came with 3 tacos or some sides to make me satisfied.         They seem always busy so good for them but if you want a good taco place there are other ones that are better than Tako.",

The daily specials are very unique and crafted for specialty; tacos, appetizers and libations.  The atmosphere is very cool, all customized by the Richard DeSchantz restaurant group. The bike chain chandeliers are so unique you'll never see anything like it anywhere else. The mural on the walls were hand done by a local artist. DJ's play on the weekends and some late nights in the evenings. The outdoor seating during Cooperative weather has a taco bar in front of the kitchen. You can watch the line Cooks make your food right in front of you.  The unique artisan Tequila's are from all over and some of the bottles are very rare and collectors love to gawk over them.   Good for small groups and date nights. You can be as intimate or as social as you like.  I highly recommend getting a few items and sharing.

The ambiance is interesting and I liked it, it was different. Would be a great place to come on a date night.   My friend and I shared the corn appetizer and it's was delicious. Our waiter, Todd, was so kind and had the toppings put on the side at our request. Todd was so wonderful in explaining the menu and what is popular. His attitude was really great and you can tell he really loves working there. It's nice to see that.   Then we shared the Korean tacos and the chicken tacos. Choosing which tacos to try was really hard. We wanted them all! Both tacos were so so so good. The Korean was my favorite.   If you go with a group, they have where you can order 6 pairs of tacos and I would definitely do that next time with a group.   I also had the spicy cucumber margarita which was fresh and delicious, not too spicy, not too sweet. Just right.   Definitely a must try spot!",

Initially when I saw the menu, the tacos seemed a little pricey ($13-$19, octopus is $22) for just two tacos. However, do not be deceived - these taco portions are big! Bigger than your standard taco and they are topped with mountains of filling. I got the carnitas tacos which I loved: carnitas, chicharrones (fried pork rinds), guacamole, pickled red onion, and salsa verde. The chicharrones are crispy and add to the nice diversity of textures and flavor to the tacos. Did I mention that these tacos are very filling?!   In terms of apps, we got the chorizo fundido and the street corn. The chorizo fundido comes with tortillas which is a little weird (would be better suited with chips) but very cheesy and delicious. Loved the street corn-comes with two half cobs that we used a knife to pare the corn off. It's topped with sriracha mayo, cheese and chili powder so it has a nice kick to it. If you are in Pittsburgh and you are a taco lover, you must check this place out!",

The taco was a perfect balance of savory tangy from the pickled onions and creamy from the cheese and avocado crema the chips and salsa were also high quality! I ordered a lemonade which was also the first sugary drink I had in 6months and you know when you get a lemonade and it's boring? THIS WAS NOT THAT, this lemonade was tangy lightly sweet it was that perfect freshly squeezed but strong lemonade ugh the whole experience was amazing I won't make you keep reading just go out and get yourself the lemonade and carnitas taco and go home with a happy mind, soul and belly!",

Wife and I shared a bar-side meal on a recent weekend night, and we had a super-fun time with an excellent meal to boot! the upstairs DJ was spinnin' the tunes and the two bartendresses (is that a word?) took good care of us and seemed to be enjoying what they did best.  As we had a long drive home (to the next state over), we did forego any drinks, but they have an extensive selection of tequillas and could whip up just about any related cocktail you wished (we'll have to do that next time!).  As for our meal, we did our typical shtick and ordered a bunch of dishes to share. We chose the street corn, papas bravas, (fried) artichoke tacos and an order of carnitas tacos.  The street corn was absolute perfection served with sriracha mayo, cotija cheese, chili powder and a slice of lime for squeezing. It was piping hot when it arrived and I had to restrain myself until it cooled so I could take bites...but it was hard to do! The papas bravas is their take on a classic Spanish dish (patatas bravas) that comes fried topped with a spicy tomato sauce along with a creamy garlic mayo based sauce. It is kind of a heavy dish and basically put us in a carb coma. The (fried) artichoke tacos came served with peashoots, crispy chiles and a crema sauce...not our favorite dish, but an unusualy and tasty alternative to a meat-based taco. The carnitas tacos however, was the rock star dish served with house-made guacamole, pickled red onions, chicharrones (fried pig skin) and a tangy salsa verde.  We scarfed those things down like nobody's business!  I loved the open-air kitchen concept and streetside dining option (wish there were seats open there!), but the vibe inside the restaurant was totally chill and the bar area was hoppin' and happening.  Will we be back? You can bet your sweet ass we will!",

We lucked out. Our original dinner plans were foiled tonight, so we showed up to Tako at 6pm and there was no wait.   Here's the thing:  It's really good, but everyone is very much the \"Downtown Pittsburgh\" price point, so it's pricey. We both felt it was all~$2 too expensive across the board.  Also, my partner's sangria was $8 for a pretty tiny cup--about the size of those skinny Coca-Cola cans.     First off, our waiter was amazing and very knowledgable--he honestly really reminded me of Antoni from Queer Eye but with out the Canadian/ Eastern European upbringing/heritage.    Food: We split the Poke to start and it was great.  Just the right amount of subtle spice and all the flavors from the tuna, sesame mayo etc and the rice crackers.  It was a great start.  Next, my partner got the Carnitas tacos and I got the al Pastor tacos.  Both were excellent. Mine had just the right amount of spice and heat (I'll admit i'm kind of a wimp with spice) and the flavors from the pineapple (Sweet, delicious citrusy bursts) and pork shoulder were excellent.  My partner loved her Carnitas tacos too, and from the bites of hers i had, i loved how the flavors mixed.  The decor is super funky, and octopus themed, and the music was interesting too; kind of made Tako feel club-like.",

    "text": "I was recently debating best tacos in the city with a friend we are lucky with how many great options we have! After a period of eating in and getting takeout from Tako almost weekly, I hadn't been in a while but missed the floury tortillas. It is still hard to get a reservation and you have to make one a couple weeks in advance, but it's worth the wait. Tako is very small and quite dark inside but it's an awesome atmosphere. Drinks are all amazing. I haven't been able to order anything but a margarita but they are all amazing. The classic is a can't miss, the spicy pineapple is unique, and the cilantro is my personal favorite.   For appetizers, the street corn is the way to go. The corn is on the cob and there are two of them so it is great for sharing. The sauce and cheese are full of flavor and just a little bit of spice. The queso is a very generous portion and has a lot I mean a lot of chorizo as well as a sweeter pepper and green onion. The queso is served with 4 tortillas but you can also ask for their yummy and salty house made chips if you run out of room on your tortilla like me.   Now for the tacos. I've tried a lot and haven't been disappointed. The namesake is after the octopus or in Japanese, tako. It is a giant serving and is great if your an octopus person. The Korean is delicious pork with some spice. The carnitas is a generous portion of meat with delicious pickled onion and house guacamole. It's the perfect mesh of flavors on a tortilla. Steak and chicken - can you go wrong? Obviously not! The chorizo is delicious and comes with a giant fried egg on top m, but my personal favorite? The pastor. Perfectly seasoned pork with cilantro (I'm a fan if you didn't know) and sweet sweet pineapple. A wonderful balance of flavor and the perfect size.   Tako is definitely worth the wait. If you're getting appetizers and drinks, I would recommend getting one order of tacos (that's 2 per order) and an extra to split with a friend. Or you could order three and you and the friend could have one of each. You can't go wrong at Tako. My only complaint is everything is so good I can never make it to dessert.",

The wine is $12 for a tiny glass, and the tacos (even though they are tasty) are tiny for $16 - $18 (for 2)  The service was awful, from the moment our server asked me to not sit on the same side of the table \"because our tables are small\"... and the table next to us was vacant....(the entire duration of our time here) or the time when the food runner threw our food down in front of us not once, but twice. No one asked how our food was, and when we asked for our check it was once again slammed down on the table.   Do I have a light above my head that screams \"please be rude to me?\" That's what it has felt like lately...   Tacos were tasty but not for the price. Service was completely disappointing and borderline upsetting.   Wouldn't make reservations here again.",

I dont think the flavors meshed that well and the octopus didnt taste fresh.   I also had a bite of the korean and shrimp tempura ones, which were ok in taste but definitely overpriced for what it's worth   Would I go back? : Unfortunately, I would not. For the price and quality, you could easily find better tacos somewhere else. One of the few redeeming qualities is their cool nautical decor.",

    "text": "Moved to Liberty about a month ago and have a lease at 6th & Penn so I literally smell this place every night after work. Finally stopped in mid-week with my wife to try some of the legendary bites!   I was kind of sweating the price tag per taco and wondering if the food was going to be both plentiful and flavorful (this coming from a guy who second guesses the dollar tacos at Taco Bell because they may not be filling enough...).   When my wife and I showed up, we checked in (as we had a reservation) and were immediately seated at a high table. Service was prompt and with a smile.   We weren't exactly sure how much we needed, but ended up ordering 3 different tacos and sharing each plate. It was just right for me and my wife got a to-go box for her last one (btw, she said it was even more amazing the day after).  We ordered chicken, Korean, and a pork special taco they had on the menu that evening. The orders were quickly filled and came out all together which was nice.   I'm not particularly hard to please, but I also loved everything we ate! Not a single complaint! The tacos were absolutely stacked with meat and garnishes, and all the meats were tender and well seasoned.   I would come back in a heartbeat and eat all three tacos again, but that would be boring. Will definitely be back to try more of the menu! And in case you're wondering, I would absolutely pay these prices again for this food.   Also, as an aside, the owner/manager came out and personally asked how our food was and I just thought that was a really thoughtful touch.",

It's a very busy place and after eating here, I totally see why. It is the real deal, and it's crazy that's in PA. I would recommend this place over a ton of places in CA or AZ, it was that light.   Decor-dark, intimate, and cozy. It has a great vibe with bright vibrant colors throughout with great artwork. I sat at the bar and it is well stocked with many options.   Service-bar tender was pretty good, he took our orders promptly and checked on us frequently.   Food-So amazing! Everything was top notch, grilled corn app reminded me of street corn from the streets of Mexico City. The tacos were great, I've never had octopus tacos that good, the octopus was perfectly cooked and tender. The flavors of all the toppings worked like a perfect symphony of flavors. Tortillas were like mom's and I left this place so impressed that I've been waiting for my next visit to PA.   This place is worth every cent, do yourself a favor and eat here.",

    "text": "Holy taco! This delicious place was recommended to us by a local for when we visited from out of town! I am so glad it came as a top recommendation and was so close to our hotel (walking distance from the Omni) because we had the best experience here!   First off, the decor is stellar and immediately gives you a hip vibe like it really is the place to be (and it truly is)! The lighting, decorative bar, viewable kitchen and seating arrangements all make for an amazing experience! We actually had so much fun sitting at the bar that we decided to forgo our table reservations and eat at the bar!  The bartender made for a really positive experience as she was easy to talk to (we learned a lot about the restaurant and other sister restaurants) and we were able to check out their massive and eclectic collection of alcohol! We both had strawberry margaritas that were out of this world and were a great start to the dining experience! We also started with chips and guacamole and both agreed that they were probably the best chips we've had (we've ate our fair share of chips and guacamole)! Additionally, I had to try their street corn because following the tasty chips and marg, I knew it would be delicious which it was-so much so that I didn't really share and scarfed it all down myself!  For the main entrees, we decided to get different tacos so we could share (see, I do know how to share)! I went with the shrimp tempura tacos and he had the chicken tacos! We weren't sure what the size would be given they were only serving two but we were pleasantly surprised by how big they were along with how much shrimp/chicken was in each one! I really have a hard time deciding which I liked more because both had unique flavors and were excellent! The shrimp tempura was different than other shrimp tacos yet the chicken had this phenomenal flavor! I highly recommend either and/or both! Pro tip: get you someone to share with so you can try more than one!   Overall, the food was fantastic, the atmosphere was so fun, we left stuffed with leftover chips in hand and really loved this place! Actually so much so that it's been two weeks since our trip to the burgh and I am still daydreaming about these tacos and have yet to eat tacos since because they will never be able to compete with tako's tacos!",

Whyone affects my memory... but guess what? I woke up the next day talking about that \"squid taco.\" I learned it was octopus, and not squid. I was hooked! I like to try new foods, but octopus isn't something i'd normally gravitate to. Yes, it's that good!  Whe been back since and we got the big board. We had the octopus, chorizo, steak and artichoke. Octopus is still my favorite, but the chorizo and artichoke are so flavorful. Plus, you seldom can go wrong with steak.   The drinks are great and reasonably priced. If you want to feel like you're on vacation, try the toasted colada, a great blend of tropical fruit flavors. I also enjoyed the red and white sangria. I do prefer the white sangria because of the tropical fruit flavors.  The staff is very nice, personable, and efficient. Il definitely be bringing more visitors to try this place out.   Also, There's 1 bathroom but it's clean. They have a urinal for men so it makes it easier to avoid the mess.",

Ceviche (2/5): didn't have authentic ceviche flavor, also small portion.   Al Pastor Tacos (3/5): was alright, nothing special.  Octopus Tacos (3.5/5): this was good, but not a fan of the flour tortillas here and $22 is quite high.   Fish Tacos (2/5): would not recommend.   Overall it wasn't worth the cost to me, but then again I live in California where we have tacos everywhere so this may be really good for people who live in Pittsburgh.

    "text": "Nice drink menu. Good service. Octopus tacos to die for.   Tako has been on our list for quite some time. Even when we lived on the other side of the country, Tako was a high-priority restaurant we wanted to visit. For any number of reasons it took us some time to finally get here, but it was worth the wait.   We started off with drinks - my wife getting a margarita and me with a sangria. I will say I was a little concerned up first sips. While my wife's margarita was tasty, my sangria tasted really watered down. It had almost no taste. Upon inspection it appeared that some of the ice had melted and there was a layer on top that was mostly water. Once I got past the water, the sangria was quite good - with that right mix of wine, sweetness and fruit.   We started with the Street Corn, which was a nice serving to share. It had a great combination of sweetness from the corn, with the savory cheese and spices. We thought about other appetizers, but wanted to eat more tacos than appetizers.   For tacos we decided to split three orders. Each order has two tacos - each of which is larger than your average street taco.  We went with Shrimp, Pastor and Octopus.   The Pastor was my least favorite, but it was still tasty. The meat seemed a little dry, but this was balanced by the pineapple salsa.   The shrimp tacos were fantastic. Marrying tempura battered shrimp with sweet yet spicy mayo was just delightful. And the mixture of textures (crunchy, soft, smooth) made this a real treat.   But the real star was the Octopus tacos. Oh man, these things are crazy good. It would be worth returning just for these. In fact I think these raise my grade a whole star on their own. In case I have not been clear: ORDER THE OCTOPUS TACOS.   If you are considering Tako, make a reservation. The restaurant is small and it fills up fast. The food is fantastic, so demand is high.   Tako is a totally unique eating experience. It has something to please most - classics like Al Pastor and Carnitas, but more adventurous options like Foie Gras and Octopus.",

We order the chorizo fundido to share. The flour tortillas are tasty. It was a heavier appetizer as the name implies. The chorizo in melted cheese was too much for me.   Entree wise, I chose the Korean and Hubs ordered the carnitas. We were both oh so disappointed. The Korean was overpowered by the red dragon sauce, which was essentially salty marinade drizzled on after the fact. I tasted the pickled cucumber, saw a shred of cabbage, and was perplexed by the take on flat iron (fried beef??).   Hubs was picking carnitas off his taco. That was a sign, too greasy he said. It was too much meat. The bit of avocado and onion was not enough to balance the heavy protein.  Beers are bottles, no drafts.",

I was going to get the taco's but something told me to order the POKE.  If you like Poke you must try theirs...  It alone is worth the trip.  Very good.    Overall if you are downtown and want to try something a little different go to TAKO.  You will not be disappointed.",

The classic Margarita was delicious and perfectly done.   I ordered the artichoke tacos. This was the only vegan taco offering. I cannot recommend this dish. Everyone hates when you eat an artichoke and you have that fiber left in your mouth. This was my experience. The outside leaf on each artichoke was charred and dry. Next, there were whole lemon slices in the taco. They seemed to be dried a bit so we're difficult to bite into. Then there were these hard bits of charred chili pepper. These were not pleasant because they caught in my teeth like a stone. Our waiter warned me after I ordered that these were spicy hot tacos and they were! So the only vegan taco is very spicy. Seriously. I was coughing.  My husband had the chicken tacos and loved them. Nice char and full of flavor. We also ordered the crab cake tacos to share. I do recommend these if they are still available when you go.",

We ordered the Taco Big Board, six pairs of various tacos, which was enough for four people, along with an order of the chips and salsa. All the tacos were good, if my memory serves me well we had the Al Pastor, Korean, Tako (which is octopus), Carnitas, Pollo and Baja. All were great with distinct flavors but the one that missed was the Korean. Way too salty! I thought it was my taste buds, but I had two other people try them and they agreed. Maybe a one off, I have friends that have eaten there on numerous occasions and they rave about it. One final note, the music was so loud that day we could not hear each other talk. We all rushed through our meal and couldn't wait ti get outside. Maybe we're too old? But the food was good and drinks were on point. Definite visit.",

The tacos are varied and really delicious. My big gripe is the cocktails. I'm a huge tequila fan so I was excited to try some interesting twists. My first cocktail was supposed to be \"spicy\" and it barely had any heat. If you're adding jalapeno to a drink don't be timid. My second drink was, according to the server, not going to be too sweet but it was so syrupy I couldn't finish it. A big disappointment, and while we might go back for tacos we definitely won't linger over cocktails.",

    "text": "We waited a bit for an outside table since it was nice out. Nice view of the open kitchen right out in the street.   My girlfriend and I each ordered a frozen margarita but the machine was broken. We got some non-frozen variations instead. A grapefruit and sage margarita, which had the right amount of savoriness and bitterness to counter the usual citrus sweetness. My girlfriend's sake margarita was a beautiful fuchsia color and tasted great.   We split some \"build your own guacamole\" with radish and pepitas. Nice crunch and we loved the tiny sliced chilies dotting the bowl.   We also split some tacos which come 2 per order. The duck confit tacos, topped with hoisin, chiles, pickled cucumber/cauliflower, mint and cilantro. Each ingredient contributed to a crazy savory/sweet, hot/cool, cooked/raw combination of flavors and textures. The carnitas tacos were our favorite. Tender, juicy braised pork shoulder with crispy bits, avocado, salsa verde, onions, and a crispy strip of chicharron on top. These were packed with juicy flavor. Super rich meat, cut with the acid from the salsa verde. A must order!! The tortillas were nice and chewy, we saw them making them in the kitchen (to order?).  We split some chocolate mouse cake for dessert after deciding we didn't have room for more tacos (but had room for dessert). It was super rich, and not too sweet, thumbs up.  I kind of wish the tacos came 3 per order (smaller sized tacos) or were smaller but a few dollars cheaper, allowing for more easy sharing. I would have loved to try a few more tacos but between the two of us we only had room for 2 tacos each.",

My expectations were basically through the roof by the time I got there after all the praises I had heard for the food, so I was hoping it wouldn't disappoint. Let me tell you...it didn't! Tako is extremely small, but the atmosphere is so, so cool. You honestly feel like you're stepping into a different world when you enter; you completely forget that you're in downtown Pittsburgh. The lighting is pretty dark, but it really sets the mood. There are only about seven tables on the ground floor, and then a few more tables up on a second floor loft. I love the fact that the kitchen is right at the front of the restaurant, so you can see the chefs making all the delicious food. The music is a little loud and I felt that I was almost yelling to talk to my friends, but the food was so good I didn't even care.  We started with a round of drinks - we all got either the red or white sangria. I tasted both, and would highly recommend the red over the white, even if you're partial to white wine. The red sangria had a lot more depth of flavor than the white. Next, we did the \"build your own guac,\" which was basically my dream come True as guacamole is one of my favorite foods of all time. We did the classic guacamole and added bacon to it. One of the best guacs I've ever had. Also, the chips were phenomenal and came out piping hot and very fresh. Next we put in an order of the famous \"papas bravas,\" which I noticed a few people had mentioned on Yelp. Oh my goshhhh they were PHENOMENAL. The potatoes themselves were crispy on the outside but very soft on the inside. There was some sort of tangy sauce on the bottom of the skillet with a hint of sweetness, and the aioli on top was more salty. Top that off with some scallions, and I was in heaven. I was so happy at that point that I would have given tako five stars even before trying the tacos.  I was tempted to order the octopus taco, but I decided to try the chicken since it was my first time and I wanted to see tako's take on the classic chicken taco. Oh man. I was already pretty full from our appetizers, but I scarfed both of my tacos down in record time. The mixture of the flavors is just amazing, and no one flavor overpowers any other. I've eaten a lot of tacos in my life, but these were the best tacos I've ever had. I am not exaggerating. If you haven't been here yet, please make a reservation and try it out ASAP. Your tummy will thank you!",

The octopus taco which is supposed to be their namesake taco was disappointing. It had giant, chewy and downright gagable  pieces of octopus in a tiny taco. To add insult to injury it was $22.00.  The music was so loud conversation was not possible even in the booths upstairs. The seats uncomfortable - wooden benches without cushions. Perfect place to take people you don't like.",

As for me and my wife, however, we arrived right as it opened (5pm) and were seated immediately. You can try your luck and do the same (you could also sit and eat at the bar).   Inside ambiance is truly incredible. I really love the vibe of this restaurant. It's two floors. Pretty dark. Edison bulbs everywhere. It's very trendy. They have octopus tentacle sconces on the wall . . . I mean, where else do you see that?   We came and ate during restaurant week. We received chips and guac, 2 appetizers (ceviche and papa bravas), and 2 tacos (al pastor & pollo asado). The chips and gauc and salsa were great!! Portion was huge and was delicious. The two appetizers were also very tasty. The Ceviche app was small but sooo flavorful. I was impressed. It was refreshing. The papa bravas . . . Listen . . . I swear I'd come back just for those potatoes. I can't explain it. They're perfect. They're delicious. Honestly, you'll do yourself a disservice if you don't order that appetizer. Heck, id order that over one of their tacos. Yeah. The tacos were pretty good. My wife had the chicken but she didn't care for it too much because the chicken tasted gummy. I tasted to see . . . Yeah, they were a bit undercooked and tasted semi-strange as a result (I'm sure that was a fluke and not the norm). I thought the al pastor was pretty good as well, but I honestly wasn't blown away! For the normal price tag of these tacos, I don't know id rush back. I thought the appetizers were more appealing, which gives me a huge internal conflict as the name of the restaurant suggests where the emphasis should be!   But taken as a whole, from ambiance to service (incredible wait staff!!) to meal . . . This is a 4 star restaurant and well worth your visit and the wait. I will 100% come back and try the Tako taco. That's what is apparently out of this world, and I will update this review when I do try it!   Extra: Tako also had a stand in the Christmas village in Market Square. All I can say is, wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Soooo so so good. I want the sandwiches they were selling every day of my life. If we are all so fortunate enough to see that stand there again next season, you do not want to miss!!",

The hostess offered to text us when the table was ready which allowed us to walk down along the riverside and enjoy the Pittsburgh views. We arrive back just in time for our indoors table.  We made sure to spend some time looking thru the glass windows into the kitchen on our way into the dining room. The vibe was super hip and alive. The DJ was throwing down some very good tracks. We ordered our custom made guacamole, feta cheese, tuna belly and tomatoes. It was not only unique but a truly amazing combo of flavors. Next up street corn, Tako tacos, and Korean tacos. Absolutely delicous! Full of rich bold umami!! Unfortunately we didn't leave room for dessert but next time in Pitt we will be back to check some out.",

We see immediately turned off by the extremely loud music/ they have an inhouse dj who had talent and spun some good tracks but it was too loud for me to enjoy the company I was with.  Cocktails were very enjoyable- my guava margarita was sweet but potent.   Apps/ entrees- some but not many options for veggies and probably near impossible for vegans since a lot involve cheese. We loved the street corn (perfect mild spicy with sweet corn and salty cheese) which was perfect to split between two people and wet your appetite. They had a beet appetizer option and a special entree that involved butternut squash - other than that there was only one veggie taco to choose from- which was sad but that one option- the mushroom tacos were very filling, the perfect flavor and texture combos and extremely enjoyable.  Dessert was a huge disappointment. We ordered the funnel cake which was bland, minimal powdered sugar and came with this caramelized apple sauce that did not make the dish any better. We took two bites and left the rest. Not worth the calories and probably the worst dessert I've had the past 6 months.  Service was impeccable and in many ways more than I expected for this type of atmosphere. Our waiter had a man bun and was attentive, always keeping our waters full, folding napkins, and whisking away dirty plates to keep the pace perfect. Was really impressed by the service.  Overall excellent tacos and cocktails but due to such disruptive music/volume we will not be returning.",

Luckily we got there 3 minutes after they opened as opposed to 7 minutes after we wouldn't have found an open seat for quite some time had we done that.   I was excited to see poke on the menu. That's a dish that's very difficult to find in Pittsburgh. I've honestly never seen that available here. It met my expectations and then some. We also had the chips and salsa. It was nice to see a place serving more than just one basic salsa with their chips. They gave us three different salsas and they all tasted great.   The service from everyone was awesome.

Cocktails are heavily centered around tequila, which is to be expected as it is a taqueria, and were delicious.  I tried the mezcal version of the Old Fashioned and was pleasantly surprised.   We started with the guacamole with blue cheese and duck confit, and then split a few orders of tacos: Korean, Pollo & Al Pastor.  Everything was really tasty and was reminiscent of my favorite taco joint in Chicago (shout out to Big Star!) so I was impressed.  Service was friendly and the space was done really well.  I think it caters to bigger parties as if you go with only 2 people, you are seated at a high top near the bar.  My only gripe is that I thought it was a bit expensive.  Our guacamole was good and had expensive ingredients, however it cost $18, and tacos are about $7 each so I thought it was a lot.",

I had a hand-crafted ginger cocktail (I think it was called a diablo), it was delicious, but I wished it was a little spicier since it was infused with fresh ginger.  Hubby ordered the shrimp tempura tacos, I had the Asian beef--we each thought that we would not be satisfied since each order consisted of two tacos, however, we both ended up eating only one taco each.  His shrimp was cooked perfectly and the taco was delicious.  My beef, was amazing!  Crispy on the outside, yet melted in my mouth!

The staff was incredibly nice, and almost too quick to clean off our table (I lost a side plate before I could even stop her). Fortunately, staff is always there waiting to help (plate restored!). The manager was attentive and when I shrugged shoulders for one of my dishes when our waitress asked how it was, he quickly came over to ask what I didn't like, what could be improved, etc. You really can't have a better start, service-wise.  The space is awesome to take in, with the octopus theme running wild. Adventurous concept, visually,  and just over-the-top enough to be a talking point, while never interfering with the experience.

All good, with my only exception being the thick and hard-to-get-through octopus on the Tako taco. Curious if I'll be the only one to make suggestions to the manager on that one. Flavor-wise, it was good. Just texture wasn't ideal. Otherwise, food was spot-on. I'd recommend it all!  Also started with the Asian Bolognese ask the Papas Bravas. We just returned from Barcelona and Bravas'd our faces off, so I can't say they beat our best there, BUT I'd order again. The bolognese was excellent.   All-in-all, I'm already looking forward to going back. If the service and food holds up like tonight (opening nights are always hit-or-miss), it'll become a staple in our Pittsburgh restaurant shortlist. Enjoy!",

Unfortunately, we didn't specify where we wanted to sit so we got stuck with the bar table outside. The interior was decked out with crazy decor and dim yet colorful lighting that created a unique atmosphere.     I got the Duck Confit taco. The duck was tender and the hoisin sauce provided just enough tang while the pickled peppers and cucumber cut through the richness of the meat.   Even though it was really delicious, my two small tacos were $14. If you go here, don't expect to be super filled. You pay for the experience and the taste of unique flavors.",

    "text": "Oh my. While walking towards tako, I worried that my expectations were set too high and that I would be disappointed. However, we had a simply magical experience, and I can see why finding a 7:00pm Saturday night invitation - even three months out - is still nearly impossible!  This place is about as hip and trendy and eclectic as a restaurant can get. Though I'm sure sitting outside is very nice in the summer, the interior is where it's at - dim lighting, pulsing music, wall murals, and quirky details abound. The music cranked up a few notches around 8 or 9pm when a DJ arrived, playing beats that my electroNOW Spotify playlist-loving self hadn't even heard before.  I thought that seating might feel a bit tight, but we were ushered to the second floor to large wooden bench style seats with plenty of room to spread out - and more importantly - to spread our food out.  I started with a cocktail from the specials list - a frozen blueberry margarita that our server mentioned being really delicious. Though sweet, it had a nice balance of flavors and was the perfect drink to end a hot summer day. I should have ordered another drink or two but was distracted talking with our friends that I never made up my mind on a second drink. In retrospect, the Strawberry Yuzu margarita on the menu looks absolutely heavenly...  For our appetizers, we picked out a guacamole from the long list and also ordered the Queso Fundido. I don't remember the exact guacamole that we ordered - unfortunately the listing isn't available online - but I know that it was a chef's special and included blue cheese and bacon. Now, I'm not a guacamole lover, the avocado texture grosses me out at times, but this stuff was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fa.ma&s=335551ad9218ed8977df89b925a7761ff4d39bfc8ea8d7e92253daa82cc8abf5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">a.ma</a>.zing. However, even though I loved the guac, I quickly moved on to the queso when it arrived. I often judge a Mexican restaurant based on their queso, and this may be the best queso that I've had in my entire 30 years of life. The cheese was rich, thick, and gooey, the perfect mild white Mexican-style cheese. Typically, I like my queso relatively simple, paired with just some chips, but the dish was so well balanced and executed that I enjoyed the accompanying chorizo, peppers, and tortillas. I wrapped up the cheesy, meaty, peppery goodness into a tortilla and simply transcended into Mexican food paradise.  After such a heavenly queso experience, I didn't know if the tacos would impress, but of course, tako delivered once again. The hubby and I ordered a special pork belly taco, the Al Pastor, and the Chorizo. All three were simply delicious with very clear, distinctive, well-executed flavors. I enjoyed the light, summery flavors of the Al Pastor, pork shoulder paired with pineapple and cilantro. Each Chorizo taco was covered in carmelized onions and topped with a runny fried egg, which is one of my favorite things to eat. The Mexican food paradise just kept going.  Unfortunately, I re-entered food reality with dessert. I had high expectations as tako's sister restaurant Butcher and the Rye has always delivered very strongly here. My friend ordered what I understood to be cheesecake with berries, but it tasted and looked more like cheesecake pudding - descent, but by no means exciting or innovative. My husband and I ordered the churros and were a bit disappointed. The churro itself was bland and boring and the lack of chocolate dipping sauce was upsetting. We used some of our friend's cheesecake \"dip\" for our churros, but the dish was in desperate need of some chocolate and some salt.  Though I wish that I had ordered more tacos instead of trying dessert, I still had an absolutely incredible time and was highly impressed by the atmosphere, the decor, the service, and the food. This restaurant has officially landed itself in my Pittsburgh top 3, along with sister restaurant Butcher and the Rye and new(er) Spanish restaurant Morcilla. I am already looking to make reservations for when friends visit in October!",

    "text": "This is the only place in ANY city that has been so good that I came back the very next night and ate here again. When you walk in and they are making fresh tortillas right in front of you - you know it's a good sign.   Tako is an trendy Mexican joint that offers the essentials. Although I wouldn't call this \"traditional mexican\" they take street food and elevate it. What makes this place different is the quality. Their tacos are rather large so I would suggest splitting for the table. I don't think they let you sub orders of two. The chorizo was our favorite of them all, but the real star of the night was the queso.   My GAWD I would give my left arm for just a bite of this queso right now. It's very thick with chorizo and spicy peppers. But here's what's amazing, as if you didn't already feel disgusting enough eating a vat of cheese, they give you a BAG of fresh tortillas to rip apart and dunk into the cheese. No chips, just warm fresh tortillas. I quit counting calories after my first bite and let myself go to enjoy what is probably (still) one of my favorite appetizers in the country. And I know what you're thinking...how can queso be this good? And I'm with you. I'm not one to even order it - but our friends as the table did and we got out own order, and came back the next night to have it again. And friends, I'm no afraid to admit that. We're in a safe place here and I feel you have the right to know.   Aside from the REDONKULOUS food. The atmosphere is super cool. Dim lit with a cantina/nightclub vibe. Beautiful art and lanterns light up the space. Perfect for a girls night out or date night.   Highly recommend and super jealous that we don't have one in Cincinnati. If you're in Pittsburgh or ever have any desire to go - bookmark this now or forever live in FOMO.",

The tacos had a perfectly cooked tortilla with TONS of beef in it. They did not skimp at all. All of the flavors on top, inside, around, upside down blended amazingly and it was a really delicious taco. Two come with the meal. The thrice cooked wings - it was a big portion actually, maybe about 8 wings? I didn't finish so I'm not 100% sure. It was cooked with a fish sauce base and that made it nice and sticky and flavorful!  The one thing that sucked was that they didn't put in my order when I called and when I stopped by to pick it up 30 minutes later, they basically had to start from scratch. Bummer, but the manager did provide me with a gift card to make up for it. Too bad I'm not from the area but hopefully will make my way back because I would try it again despite this experience because the food was pretty worth it.",

DeShantz puts a lot of work into the atmosphere, decor, and presentation of his restaurants overall and this effort makes the experience even better. The food was sensational. I had the Mexican street corn as an appetizer and the flavor was so incredible. The corn was fresh, the topping was amazing, and the presentation was to die for. Then when the tacos came (I had chicken and my girlfriend had the pork belly) the way they were presented was exquisite and made them look amazing. I was so excited even before I took a bite. Once I ate it, I realized what makes these restaurants special: DeShantz takes normal, traditional ideas and gives them new life. 10000% worth the price. Can't wait to go back",

    "text": "My last night in Pittsburgh for work and I had to end the trip with an awesome dinner with an old high school friend. I was perusing Yelp, spouting out names and I came across this place. My friend said, \"Dude, if you can get us a reservation at tako THAT'S where we're going\". He must not know who I am. (Puts sunglasses on.) Needless to say, I got us a reservation after failing to online, but by calling and we went. First of all, the kitchen is at the FRONT of the restaurant because you can actually sit at a stool right outside and order food directly from the kitchen. Legit. Inside the atmosphere is almost.. \"goth-like\". its very dark, red lighting everywhere, decorative \"splatter\" on the walls, but it was certainly unique. It wasn't too packed so we were sat downstairs. The staff was very friendly, flirty and helpful to me being a first-timer. Their menus were like... newspapers which I thought was pretty cool. I had already been drinking and was feelin' spend-y (bad idea) so I started with drinks! I began with their Thai Coconut margarita which was sweet and delicious. It didn't taste very strong, but take note of that. For an appetizer we got the Thrice Cooked Wings which are covered in a caramel fish sauce all over pickled carrots, cucumber, mint chili seasoning and cilantro. I know that sounds like a wild combination, but DON'T KNOCK IT. Some of THE BEST fall-off-the-bone, like, how-did-you-make-them-taste-this-good wings I've ever had. They were hot, spicy, sweet, savory... I can't use enough adjectives. JUST KNOW, they were that good. I made the mistake of eating the chili peppers... more than twice so my mouth was on fire. For our entrees we got 6 tacos and split them so we could have 1 each of 3 different kinds. The tacos come in pairs. Seemingly expensive, but ultimately worth it. We went for the Chorizo, Carnitas and the Bistec. The Chroizo comes with carmelized onions, roasted poblano, romesco, gently fried egg, queso fresco, arbol hot sauce and cilantro. We received an anonymous tip from a table next to us to flip the egg upside down so that when you bite into the taco the egg yolk runs into the taco. OMG. Mind blown. AMAZING. I'm not even going to try describing the flavor to you. Just get it. Next was the Carnitas which comes with braised pork butt, guacamole, salsa verde, chicharrones and cilantro. Again, very good. Not as good as the Chorizo, but I have NO complaints. Lastly, the Bistec comes with wagyu skirt steak, salsa roja, gem lettuce, queso fresco, fried shishito and of course cilantro. This was my favorite of the 3. It just blew me away. The flavor combinations that the chefs were able to concoct just blow my mind. For my 2nd drink I had the Watermelon Basil margarita which was very tasty, but again, weak. I will absolutely return here to try the rest of the menu. I was extremely impressed with the food, just not with the drinks. No matter, it'll save me more money and room in my stomach for my tacos by not getting drinks.",

I expected it to be good, but it really blew my mind. The street corn appetizer was fantastic, thankfully we had chips to scrap up any sauce or cheese that didn't make it onto the corn. And the Tako Tacos were incredible. Best octopus I've ever had, just a completely different texture from calamari or even high quality grilled octopus. I told the bartender I was angry at every other octopus I've ever had for being so bad in comparison. The care and effort they put into everything from the tortillas to the ailois to the octopus was really evident. 5 stars. Now if I could just get a table, I'd go back all the time...",

It is quite a small restaurant and reservations for dinner go weeks in advance. You can eat at the bar without a reservation and it turns over relatively quickly, but you might be waiting for a bit. You can make a reservation on their website through Yelp SeatMe. I went with my boyfriend and we had to shout at each other and still couldn't really hear one another. It is incredibly loud in there. It is also so dark you can hardly see the menu or what you're eating. The decor is very confused, with some metal lockers, Christian paraphernalia, and black/red decor that might be found in a dungeon. It was rather dreadful of an atmosphere (the bar looks slightly better since it is a tiny bit better lit and you are sitting right next to anyone you go with, which should make hearing them a little easier). We started off with the house-made guacamole and were not at all impressed with it. I had the mushrooms tacos which were quite tasty, but not enough so to go there again. I had a pretty good mezcal-based drink. The prices were quite high for what we were getting.",

We didn't have reservations, but the staff was kind enough to seat us at a reserved table since the reservation wasn't for another half and hour or so and we told them we had to be in and out anyway to be on time for the concert. The interior is awesome, especially the octopus tentacles holding the lights. It's very dim. I loved that you can see the food being prepared inside the kitchen. We didn't have time to try any drinks, but our tacos were amazing and they came out quickly. They are good sized (perfect amount of food) and they're served on a wooden board. We got the Pollo Asado and Al Pastor tacos and shared one of each. The flavors in both were fantastic and they don't skimp on the fillings. I slightly preferred the Al Pastor because of the roasted pineapple. So good. Next time, I want to try the bistec taco and a beverage.",

The white sangria was incredibly sweet, fake-tasting, and had no discernible booze in it. My other complaint: large chunks of canned pineapple in the Al pastor, bummer. But the highlights far outweighed my disappointments. After I finished my sangria I ordered a Spicy Cucumber marg which was wonderful, well-presented and sublimely spicy! I like the build-your-own-guac concept a lot. My boyfriend is a quac newbie so we got the classic but substituting fried onions for fresh and added shishito peppers. Absolutely fantastic! We ordered the street corn, which came off-the cob (cue skepticism) but was really, really delicious. It was like if Elote was Mac n cheese. Good stuff. Pineapple aside, the Al pastor was well-seasoned and perfectly cooked. So were the Carnitas. In my opinion, all-around a great job of high end tacos which retained a good bit of authenticity. We'll be back!",

My bf got a beer and said they had a nice selection with very reasonable prices. For appetizers, we ordered the chips and salsa and then picked one of the chef's selection guacamole. I enjoyed every type of salsa and the guacamole was very unique. I ordered the Carnitas taco and my bf ordered the Tako (octopus) taco. Loved both although I favored the Carnitas surprisingly. The reason I didnt give a perfect score is because the tables in the front are way too close together. I could barely hear my bf over the conversations of our neighbors. I also think I booty bumped the one table when I was trying to leave. But overall we loved Tako and will be back again!",

Staff attentive and were very helpful getting us transport back to our hotel. Good, hip vibe and overall excellent experience!",

    "text": "I think in the case of Tako, a \"Just the facts\" type of review is best.  My s/o and I reserved a table, one month in advance.  Unfortunately, Tako has limited indoor seating.  Upon arrival we noticed that we could have sat at their outdoor counter and eaten,  (Something that we were never made aware).   In retrospect, eating outside would have been so much better because inside was extraordinarily LOUD!!!  Tako has two levels of seating, downstairs is elevated and small tables and the side which is on the aisle is just a stool, no back.  Upstairs it looked like metal tables and equally uncomfortable chairs.  It was a Friday night, so there were lots of people at the bar, which make the noise level even louder.  The strange thing was that they had a DJ playing really, really loud music over some massive speakers which were hanging from the ceiling.  It's dark and loud inside.  I wasn't told that I would be dining at an AC/DC concert.  Waiter took forever to even get to our table, like 10 mins and took our drink order.  A mixed drink is $10, and they have an extensive tequila list but with little explanation as to what is what.  Mix'n match guacamole was just ho-hum and the stuff you can ad is somewhat intriguing but all in all, flavorless.  Drinks were just okay, not very strong or flavorful for the money.  Taco's were good but not great.  The carnitas  was the better of the two we ordered, (the other was beef)  Honestly, for what the ingredients were, there was just a total lack of flavor.  They are good size and you get two tacos per order.  No matter how you dress them up, they're still just tacos and not worth the month long wait.  I'm not a 20 year old but I'm not 50 either and I'm really tired of these new restaurants that are blaring must so loud that I can't hear what the person across from me is saying.  Mediocre food, ho-hum margaritas, lazy waitstaff and ear splitting music is what you can expect if you decide to spend some time at Tako.  Oh, and did I forget they have just one bathroom!  Gross.",

    "text": "Second time to Tako and I'm over it.  I certainly didn't appreciate having to wait almost 30 minutes for table after making a reservation nearly a month prior to going.  I will say the specialty margaritas are really good.  I went with the Yellow Jacket and it was delicious.  My first time to Tako I went with the octopus tacos, and the second time I went with the carnitas.  Both tacos are just way to over-seasoned and pretentious.  I can respect the thought of trying new things and trying to find that perfect blend of flavors, but it's like the recipe is trying too hard to impress.  Also, the construction of the carnitas taco was terrible.  Too much filling with the meat and fried egg and not nearly enough taco shell.  It was extremely difficult to eat and half of the taco ending up falling out of the shell.  For me, it's really not a place worth going out of your way for, and the food & atmosphere certainly don't warrant the challenge it is to get a table and a table ON TIME.  I'll stick with contemporary Mexican going forward.",

    "text": "We kept hearing about Tako and every time I called to try to go- they were booked. I finally booked a month in advance and admittedly was a little skeptical, would it live up to the hype? Surprisingly, it was really good and very memorable. The variations on guacamole are interesting and innovative. The chips accompanying the guacamole were equally good, freshly fried but light and not oily. The appetizers were phenomenal from the kale salad (as someone who does not ever order kale) it was so tasty, I would order again. The brisket queso fundido is decadent between the warm melted cheese and fresh tortillas. As a group of six we ordered almost every appetizer and enjoyed them all. We opted for the Taco board - to experience the variety. We each had our favorite. The korean barbeque was my favorite - beautifully seasoned with just the right about of crunch provided by the veggies that were incorporated. Although, I am not a huge fan of octopus, even I can appreciate that this too was very good and for my friends, their favorite. The only taco I was non-plussed by was the mushroom, felt it was a little bland and could maybe use some more interesting seasoning to support it's presence amongst the other stellar tacos. The other plus here- the drinks were really good, not super syrupy as some designed cocktails are made. I particularly liked the el diablo and the drink made with cucumber. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is this. The DJ who was there for I believe the early part of our dinner plays music loud, really loud. As someone who used to market heavy metal music I am not someone who cannot appreciate music at a higher decibel, but the music was so loud that we had to really raise our voices almost yelling to hear one another. By the end we all commented on how sore our throats were from trying to speak and be heard.  I just don't see the purpose of music being so loud where it gets to be an impediment to normal conversation. At some point it seemed to soften and we suspected the DJ took a break. If I could give advice to Tako, it would be just lower the music. The food here is just too good and should not have to compete with an ambiance that drowns it out. It will still be hip and not so painful to the ears. Will definitely go back... perhaps with ear plug next time.",

    "text": "Great experience!  Went on a Tuesday night, they were busy but we had reservations and were seated immediately.  The waiter was professional and took care of things, but was a little overwhelmed, but the other staff and management seemed in sync and helped cover each other to ensure a good experience.  I had the spicy cucumber cocktail which was off the hook, and a great combination of ingredients.  Mexican street corn appitizer was delicious, Tako taco was great, and the octopus was cooked better and more tender than any octopus i've ever had.  Pollo asado taco was very good also, chicken was tender and seasoned perfectly, more traditional taco than to tako.  Also had the special Bo saam taco which wasn't bad, but the kimchi really overpowered the whole dish and couldn't taste the fried oyster or pork shoulder. Being that it was a special item, and still tasted good, didn't feel necessary to go down a star.  Will be back soon!  (Side note: restaurant was noted as not kid friendly, but if you're little one is not a picky eater and well behaved, you'll be fine, our daughter enjoyed the experience as well!)",

    "text": "I have been trying to get a reservation at a normal time at Tako every so often over the past few years and have never been able to. It's always been on my list to try, but they never have tables available OR if they do, it's at 11PM. I was determined to go there this weekend, so I check the reservations - nothing available. I decided to call, and they had a table available at 10PM. What surprised me the most was that when we got there, there were several tables open upstairs and downstairs during our entire meal.   Overall, the food was good, drinks were small (I think I got like, 4 ounces of sangria for $8), prices were high, service was quick and music was SO loud. Definitely don't recommend bringing your parents here. Will we go again? Maybe, but not likely.   We got the Papas Bravas appetizer which is honestly one of the better starters I've had in Pittsburgh. SO good, and easy to split between 2-4 people depending on your hunger level.   I got the Al Pastor tacos while my fiance got the Bistec. Both were good portions, but expensive. $31 for four tacos? My expectations were high. The Al Pastor had great flavor, but the saltiness was unbelievable. Granted, I am not a salt lover, but I had to chug 4 glasses of water to get through these. My fiance agreed, and he loves salt. If this salt level is normal, I recommend putting more pineapple on. The Bistec was good, but simply not worth $19.",

    "text": "I'm going to do my best to describe the meal we just had at Tako, but I certainly won't do it justice. Suffice it to say, it was one of the most perfect experiences dining out that we've had in a long, long time.  We knew coming in to not over order tacos like we did the last time, which put us in good shape. To start we had the classic guacamole and the Poke appetizer. The guacamole was as good as the last time with some homemade, still warm, tortilla chips.  The Poke? One of the best appetizers we've ever had. It was served with a spicy soy dressing, whipped lime and guacamole (which we weren't expecting). You eat it over some rice crackers and it melted in your mouth.  For our tacos, we decided on the bistec and the special Korean fried chicken which were both incredible. The couple next to us overordered like we did on or first visit, you could see it in their face immediately.  We were drinking beer and a cucumber margarita that had my wife salivating... After dinner we had a pour it Reposado to go with our sangrita. They didn't have sangrita last time we were here, so I'm glad they added it to the menu (as their manager promised).  Which led us to dessert. Fresh cheesecake served in a bowl with vanilla ice cream, fresh berries, and a lime (strawberry?) sauce. I'm not even that big on cheesecake, but once again, perfection. It didn't have any \"crust\" or \"crunch\" element but the fresh berries and mint were fantastic.  It was a special occasion, but the bill was only $100, which for what we got was incredibly reasonable. I booked the reservations 3 weeks in advance, so plan ahead of you want an early enough reservation. They definitely cater to couples of two, as opposed to parties.",

    "text": "Great experience for our weekend visit! I made our reservations a few weeks in advance after reading an article in the local magazine highlighting the best spots in town. You all did not disappoint.  Design down sides: The host station is positioned so that the employees back faces the customer upon entry. The ambiance felt a bit kitschy. Super dark, red lights, steam punk, Pirates of the Caribbean. Also, the two top tables near the bar are not intimate but create a feeling of separateness and sterility, especially since I like my husband and want to be with him. He just came over to the bench side and we squeezed together so we could actually date.   Design upsides: The live DJ was a phenomenal touch, but be prepared to sit close to hear your date. Though it was raining the curbside window seating by the kitchen was fun and inviting. The upstairs ceiling light fixtures were creative and artistic, using old doors and Edison bulbs.  The Mezcal Smash was unique and well composed. The smoked salt was a fantastic touch to the just right sweetness of the margarita. I also enjoyed the Oaxaca Old Fashioned. Totally different experience but enjoyable and worth trying.  We ordered build your own guacamole the Tako grilled octopus tacos and the Duck Confit tacos. Every last bite was delicious. It is clear the chefs have put passion and thought into each option. The flavors and textures were complex and complimented each other without taking up too much palette space.   It is easy to make tacos but what has happened here is the playful creation of a separate food group. We were delighted to continually find interesting culinary twists on a staple food. Well done! We'll be back",

I had the pollo + pork belly taco, but I've been told their best known for the octopus taco. Most people say not to waste your time making a reservation. Walk-ins are usually fairly accommodated.

I really wanted to love Tako because its former executive chef, Dave Racicot, is one of the most talented chefs I have ever had the pleasure of knowing (I have been eating at his restaurants since he opened Notion in Oakmont), so I expected great things. However, the amount of \"hype\" that surrounds Tako does not reflect the actual food. Yes, the food is good, but it is not worth making a reservation more than two days in advance for, and the prices are not worth the flavor; a $2.50 taco from Las Palmas in Oakland is both tastier and cheaper.  So, I'm not saying it's not worth going, but you should not have as high expectations as the reviews would lead you to have.",

    "text": "I made a visit to Tako based on all the previous reviews here and many locations on the Internet calling Tako THE place to go when in Pittsburgh.  As many reviews have had recalled, I was looking forward to \"the best taco I've ever had\".  Like many other restaurants, the fish option here was clearly an afterthought.  Not bad, but pretty comparable to the fish tacos at Mad Mex, which for the price point is less of a value.  I think this could possibly be the best taco you've ever eaten if you don't typically eat tacos a lot.  My taco wasn't bad, but it also wasn't amazing.  Tako did have some redeemers though.  For starters, I got the poke and street corn.  I love street corn and thought this met the bid compared to similar corns I've had in New York and Miami.  This corn was different in that it wasn't on the cob but rather loose corn.  It was very sweet but it just made me question whether or not it was fresh.    The poke...was fantastic!  It was a concoction like no other!  One part tuna, one part guac, one part sweet sauce, one part crisps.  All my flavor and texture needs were met far beyond expectation.  I will say it's very much an acquired taste.  But if you have it, it sends you to the moon and back.  It was okay.  But for $50 a person, it's not really somewhere I'm gonna be dying to return to.",

    "text": "There's nothing WRONG with Tako.  The venue is sick--every detail is well thought out, from the Edison bulb ceiling lights to the soft core porn octopus wall murals.  It was really cool to get a glimpse into their impressively tiny glass-walled kitchen, and the service couldn't have been better.  But to me, Tako is not a restaurant--it's a bar.    The DJ keeps the pop music loud, and on a Thursday night, we struggled to hear the other end of our table of 5.  The Mushroom Tacos and on special Pork Belly Tacos we ordered were delicious, with all their components really sync, but the tacos themselves were the only delicious items on the menu.  Our group also tried the Kale and the Street Corn and made-our-own Guac, and none of them impressed.  The salad was tiny and lackluster, with the sesame seeds being the singular standout ingredient, and the chopped roasted poblano bits in the guacamole made every bite of the (small) dish bitter.    Sad starters aside, the customer left with very few desirable menu items, and the focus really does seem to be on the drinks.  That being said, this isn't necessarily bad if that's what you're looking for.  I wasn't.    The bottom line--come thirsty but not hungry, pass on the appetizers, and expect to pay $18 for a pair of their signature Tako tacos (You might hope that these are larger than your standard sized $2 street tacos.  They're not.).  It was a decent enough experience for a Thursday night, and I definitely understand all the hype, but I probably won't be back.  Would I have chosen  this place for an obnoxious screamfest reunion with my sorority sisters?  Sure.  Would I make another reservation 3 weeks out for a nice dinner with my fiancee?  Def not.  Personally, I prefer restaurants where the cooking is the focus.  If Richard DeShantz is trying to offer Pittsburgh a higher-end version of the over-copied Roy Choi concept, it's the food that's going to have to step up and deliver.",

The drinks were slightly pricy but delicious, the lychee margarita was probably my favorite. The pineapple jalapeno margarita is not for the faint of heart, some serious spice in that one! The guacamole was tasty and exactly what i expect. It didn't exactly knock my socks off for 11$ and 1 cup serving size. Id recommend getting a different appetizer if you go. We tried three tacos: duck confit, carne asada, and carnitas. The carnitas was hands down easily the best one out of the three. I would eat the raw tomatillo salsa off a spoon it's that good. The other two were good but not amazing. The carne asada was actually sweet which doesn't really float my boat, but to each their own. Overall, this is a fun restaurant to try if you're into stretching your comfort zone. We might be back to try the \"tako\" sometime!",

They then proceeded to try and talk us out of ordering the big board of tacos so that they didn't have to make them. Then, when we ordered the big board anyway, they proceeded to bring drinks, appetizers, and all of our food out at once. All of the servers waiting on us and delivering food acted like we were an inconvenience to them. The food was good. I'll give them that.

I understand that this place is supposed to be fusion food but the quality was just not good at all.  When we arrived my girlfriend and I stopped at the bar. I had the mezcal margarita and she had the wine frozen margarita. About 10 minutes later, we were sat at a table. It took about 15 minutes before our server got to the table. When he got there you could tell he really didn't want to serve us. So we made it easy for him and order everything right off the bat. We got the queso fundido, tako and korean. The queso fundido stuck to the roof of your mouth and not in a pleasant way. The tako tasted fishy as if the octopus was old and the Korean was ok but nothing to write home about. The worst part was that during the whole meal the music was so loud it was almost impossible to have a conversation.  Overall, my advice is if you are looking for good Mexican fusion food that won't leave you poor, I recommend trying Bakersfield Penn Ave. Much better food and drinks and much more reasonably priced.",

    "text": "I mean, what is there to say about tako that hasn't already been said? I don't know if I knew what a taco was until I ate at tako. I suppose that is a good start? Tako is one of the several restaurants in the area that are owned by the same person/company. Pork & Beans and Meat & Potatoes (I think) are also related to tako in some strange bastardized brother-sister relationship. During my trip to Pittsburgh I was able to eat at two of the three restaurants and both were impressive. But alas, this review is about tako, and the cultural awakening it provided.  Food: Wow! Seriously. As a foodie, even I sometimes look at some foods, such as tacos, and say, \"a taco is a taco\", right? Well, I (and everyone else who may have uttered this phrase) would be wrong. We ordered the 'Korean Taco' and the 'Carnitas'. You wouldn't think that by ordering a carnitas taco they could bring much of anything new to the table. Well they did.  Carnitas: The pork was just unbelievable. Seasoned to perfection, moist, succulent, and tender. Seriously, I would eat a bowl of that pork! Then came all of the toppings and additives from guacamole, to chicharones, and other delectable and delicate nuances that turned this taco into a 'holy-sh*t-what-did-i-just-put-in-my-mouth!' From the warm corn tortilla that is cooked on a griddle, to all the toppings and combinations of flavors, this is seriously one of the most complete dishes I have ever eaten. Completely satisfies the palette. (5/5)  Korean: So, I said all of those outstanding things about the carnitas taco, so you'd think, 'what could he possibly say about this next one that could even compare?' Well, again, 'Wow!' Add everything I said about the carnitas taco, and sprinkle-in some umami. From the kimchi-slaw to the korean short rib meat, this taco took me to a place I didn't think was possible. I can't recommend this taco enough. (6/5...yea, that is a 6)  Tres Leches Cake: I am a fan of milk. Milk three times? Damn son...now that even has Fergie begging for more. Though, despite how good this dessert was, compared to the tacos, it was barely above average. I mean, don't get me wrong, it was good...damn good, but compared to those tacos, it was pretty typical of what I would expect. If anything, those tacos set that triple milk cake up for failure. Yea, I would hold a grudge if I were tres leches. (4/5)  Overall Food: 5 / 5  Service: This was very spotty. He was relatively attentive at first, but then required me to get his attention for every other facet of the meal. More water? Needed to ask for him. Dessert? Needed to ask for him. Check? Needed to ask for him. This was disappointing.  Service: 2 / 5  Atmosphere: This place is not my jam. It was loud, it was dark, it was hispter-ish, and it was tight/crowded. Pretty much everything I hate. Despite that, the furnishings were cool, and everything did flow extremely well together. This was a cool spot, it just wasn't for me. Despite that though, I would definitely eat at their outside seating or at the outside counter. Bonus points for that because it was super cool.  Atmosphere: 4 / 5  Price: Not much to say here. For the best tacos I have ever had, this is a sure 5. I don't even think I looked at the bill, that is how little I cared what the price was...and I am a thrifty kind of guy...coupon-cutter and everything!  Price: 5 / 5   Conclusion: Again, I probably didn't bring any new material to the table here; but if you haven't been to tako, this is a must-stop for you if you are visiting and near the 6th street location. Best tacos I've ever had.",

    "text": "We dined at Tako before a show at Heinz Hall. Perfect location. Luckily we remembered to make a reservation (as it gets very busy). We tried the Poke for an app and it was excellent. I can't give any input on the margaritas, as I do not like sours, but I tried the gin fizz cocktail and it was very good! Don't let the avocado mixed in scare you.  We also had the chorizo and duck confit tacos. Both were good but the chorizo ones were a bit messy. Our waitress was great as well! Would definitely return.  The only down side of this place was that it was very low lit. Not a deal breaker, but just something to be aware of if you dine at Tako.",

I sat outside on consecutive warm summer evenings and watched the happy kitchen crew create beautiful, fresh, eclectic food bursting with flavor.  They did this while having fun (except for the girl with the tattoo on her neck who only very rarely smiled unfortunately).  Most importantly, the kitchen crew loves to blast old school rap which for thirty something's like me is, well, intoxicating.   I even bought a t-shirt, enough said.    The only negative is the cramped quarters inside.  The hallway to check in with the hostess is very narrow and a high traffic area.  My elbow accidentally caught some boob on a lady who glared back at me like it was an intentional boob elbow.",

My only GRIPE - and this is a BIG one - is that there is no way to make reservations online. One of the other reviewers was correct when she said that often the phone is just not picked up. Come on Tako!!! ( and your next door neighbor Butcher and the Rye) It's the digital age. We should be able to contact you online to make a reservations. I'm busy and I don't have time to keep calling back during the day for someone to finally answer. I want to come back. Make it easier for me!",

The ceviche had amazing flavor and we both enjoyed it a lot. The queso funded was pretty good, although the cheese hardened very fast so you have to eat it quickly. I ordered the al pastor tacos and my boyfriend and the pollo tacos. We both agreed the al pastor were superior to the chicken ones although they were both very tasty. The only downside was that the food was all pretty spicy, even though we ordered some the least spicy tacos, according to the waiter.",

Fortunately for me, I was alone so I sat at the bar located right outside. LOVED that concept. You can also see the kitchen from the sidewalk which I think is a genius idea to attract more customers as the food was not only attractive to look at, it was also delicious. Also, having grown up in Spain, I know I good Sangria when I drink one and thankfully, the Sangria I ordered made me feel like I was back home (not too many time I get to say this). I also ordered the duck confit tacos and they were a hit! I recommend you order them if you like spicy food. However there were two things that were a miss: first, I noticed that the hostess could've maybe...smiled a bit more. Although friendly when we spoke both on the phone and in person, she looked like she didn't want to be there at all. As a customer, this is a bit disappointing since your first experience with a restaurant begins with the host/hostess and seeing her look bored or perhaps annoyed really does not leave a good impression. Also, I ordered a ceviche to start off and I thought it could have had a bit more flavor.   Having all this said, I will surely come back to Tako in the future. The cooks look like they know what they're doing and are constantly supervised, the service was fast and attentive, sangria was phenomenal, and what I believe was the owner is extremely welcoming and professional.",

I got bumped into enough in the crowded hostess area to be annoyed and I typically am disappointed when I go to places that have been hyped. Soon enough the only \"chip\" was the fresh, hot tortilla kind that came in an ample portion, with terrific house-made salsa and guac. The chips themselves were top-notch and addicting. We then sampled the ceviche and the street corn. It was my first time trying ceviche and I think it's just not my thing. A little lime-y for my taste, but beautifully presented. On to the street corn. It should be required for all patrons to try it...I can't recall having a better side dish anywhere. My description won't do it justice. I'm talking \"side-dish at my last meal\" good. TRY IT! My fiancee and I had pollo asado, baja (fish) and the bistec (steak) tacos. The chicken was anything but plain, and bursting with flavor. The fish was battered perfectly and the toppings checked all the boxes - a little saltiness, a little sweetness, a little bitterness from the radish, but tons of flavor. The steak was pretty rare (probably avoid if you prefer well or medium well) but super tender and flavorful. When I dine out, I want to find something I can't easily replicate. Though I wish I could (especially with that street corn), everything here is so intricately spiced and seasoned, there's no way I'm replicating these flavors. Our server was fantastic, enthusiastic and engaging. Definitely worth the wait and the crowded atmosphere...I will definitely be back",

Granted, they are doctored up, but at the end of the day, it's a taco. The location also requires that you pay for parking except for Sunday, so it's overall an pricey endeavor.  Also, you'll need to reserve a table in advance to ensure seating.

    "text": "I love tako! Highly recommend getting reservations if you can, but I've also been seated outside without a reservation before. Inside the restaurant is octopus themed (tako means octopus in Japanese), very hip, and can be pretty loud. Honestly my description doesn't do the place justice!   They serve fusion tacos, appetizers, drinks, etc. I wouldn't go to this place expecting authentic tacos, but it definitely can be an amazing experience if you go in with an open mind. I don't even like octopus and the Tako taco tasted good to me! Another favorite is the Korean style one. Carnitas were good too, but I would recommend trying some of the more out-there tacos if you're here. In terms of appetizers I can recommend the papas bravas and the poke. The poke came with a lime foam which was definitely interesting (although I did find the amount of poke to be a little less than I would have expected for the price)! Drinks here are solid as well.",

They were good but not worth the price. Guac was mediocre and a tiny portion for $14. Chicken taco was bland IMO, which I found strange because it looked well seasoned. Just not worth the price for what you get. Don't let the words 'gourmet' and 'fusion' fool you.",

    "text": "Okay....finally found a reservation at a time that is not close to midnight and on a weekday in the holiday season. I was so excited to be there after all the reviews I read on Yelp and the hype my friends created. However, both me and my friend felt this place is overrated after finishing our tacos. Here are more details.  The interior is definitely different from a regular restaurant in Pittsburgh. I remember visiting restaurants with this dimly lit, sophisticated themed interior when I visited New York city. Maybe part of the hype is due to the interior. Our server was nice and the service was quick though the place was packed.   We started with Papas Bravas - fried potatoes served over tomatoe sauce and topped with roasted garlic mayo and green onions. These are definitely the best fried potatoes that I had in a while and it was a good quantity for 2 people. I highly recommend this one. It also has a nice aroma when they bring it to your table.   For entree, we ordered 2 varieties of tacos - Pollo Asado and Shishito. Pollo Asado is lime marinated chicken taco served with avacado and other garnishing items. I did not find any lime flavor in the chicken. It is bland and lacked seasoning for my preference. My friend like the Shishito tacos, but again I did not get the well seasoned flavor profile I was expecting. I wish they offered a wedge of lime on the side for the tacos.   For dessert, we ordered tres leches. I had tres leches in the past and it was way softer and fluffier than the ones I had here. However, the taste is good. Not too sweet and it is good quantity for the price. Entire plate screamed holiday theme with a heavy pumpkin spice flavor.   I recommend this place if you are interested in a different sophisticated restaurant experience for eating tacos.",

Me and my guy got sat right on time. My expectations for this place were so high, and they were met. The choices of margaritas were great - o got the spicy pineapple & it was definitely spicy + sweet!   Guac was kind of expensive, wasn't sure if I wanted to spend the money on it but I figured go big or go home? Glad I did because it was soooo good.   I ordered the veggie tacos I was worried by the description of my taco that I'd be underwhelmed but oh boy was I wrong. It was so flavorful and filling and ah, I'm still thinking about it a week later. Like I said, it filled me up, but it tastes so good I could've eaten another 2.  The venue is super cool - intimate but still has a really great energy to it. My only wish - more chips/guac for the price you pay. Regardless, I'm stoked to get back there. Tako foreeever.",

    "text": "Tako is one my very favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. I'm clearly not alone of that - this tiny restaurant is always booked! A reservation weeks in advance is pretty much always necessary. It's worth the wait though for the creative mixed drinks and equally inventive tacos. Tako serves its Asian-Mexican fusion food in a small, dimly lit space with creative decor and danceable music, making it feel as though you've walked into somewhere secret.   If you go to tako and are of age to consume alcohol, I'd say a margarita is a must! The spicy cucumber margarita is fantastically cooling and hot at once. On my most recent visit, I had the coconut margarita - it was a like a margarita and a pina colada had a happy baby. You really can't go wrong, unless you don't order a margarita at all.  As far as food, the tacos are a must. I have had the non-meat taco flavors. I used to love their mushroom taco with huitlacoche but the mushroom taco has since changed so on my most recent visit I opted for the shishito taco which was quite tasty and they managed to squeeze a lot of peppers into two tacos. Side note: the flour tortillas are not vegetarian but the corn tortillas are. My friends and family have also said positive things about the other flavors of tacos. The chorizo taco has been praised for being rich but it has been noted to not be very spicy. And the tako (Japanese for octopus) taco is noticeably octopus tentacle so you have to decide for yourself if that's fun or intimidating.",

I am terrible because I tend to get the same thing which is the guacamole, queso fundido, paps bravas, and the chicken tacos.  It is definitely enough food to share!  I do miss being able to make your own guacamole but I understand why they took that option away.  Margaritas and other cocktails are also tasteful and refreshing.  I've also had the chorizo and tako tacos as well - again all yummy!  I recommend the La Paloma as well as the grapefruit and sage cocktails.  Servers are great too!  My only small complaint is that it is very loud which makes it difficult to talk.  You feel like you are yelling across the table sometimes.

We walked in and were promptly seated per our reservations, but it took about 15 minutes for our waiter to come say hi. Long enough that we paroozed the menu and already picked out what we wanted.

We had a party of six for 9PM on Halloween night, and I was ready to have a fun night with good company... but at the risk of sounding 100 years old, I could barely hear a thing thanks to the music blasting in the background. Is this a club or a restaurant? :/  Rant aside, the food is pretty good here. Our chips and classic guac were tasty as expected, but the chicharrons were meh (my Latina friend was unimpressed). The two tacos we each got were decently sized, and the flavor combinations were delicious. Mine had pork, pineapple, and avocado, and I swapped my second taco for a friend's duck confit taco. I would probably be down to try all the taco choices on the menu, to be honest.   I do have to say though, it's kind of weird to have a sit-down dinner wait time for tacos that we all essentially inhaled in a couple minutes. If the atmosphere had been conducive to actual conversation vs. yelling across the table, the waiting would have been more enjoyable at least. For that reason I'd dock a star from my rating.",

We were seated in the outside seats looking into the kitchen which was very fun! The service was good.  Our first food item was the poke, and it was amazing! So dynamic and tons of different flavors as you go through the dish. We chose three types of tacos from the menu as well, one with pork and pineapple, another with mushroom, and the seemingly requisite tako. I was actually not so impressed with the tacos themselves. The parts seemed to be cooked well (really tender octopus, soft pineapple, etc) but the flavors were too complicated for me. The mushroom taco didn't have enough texture and was quite mushy and unappealing. The tako had crisped chickpeas which were so bitter and overpowering that, at first, I thought something in the taco had been badly burned. The pork taco was tasty but not incredible.  Overall, I would definitely go again, but probably only for the appetizers.",

This time we just got the trio of chips and salsa, the korrean and baja tacos. The options are creative, yet simple leaving your taste buds happy. Everything was rich in flavor and filling. I had just had guacamole earlier in the day so wasn't feeling it at the time, but build your own guac! By the others sitting near us, it looked pretty amazing. I would suggest making a reservation, because we went on a Tuesday and couldn't get in until 8:45 pm.  Why not give it 5 stars? Well, it's loud... like VERY loud. So at least you can stuff your face, because a conversation is not easy to have here. I can deal with people loudness, but the music was like a club, which isn't ideal for a meal if you ask me. If they would fix that, this place would be perfect. The word is out, and it's to go to tako... and I agree!",

An avid concert go-er, I don't mind a party, but I like to talk at dinner.  We shared the guac which was great, chips had perfect amount of salt, chicken, Korean and al pastor.  All were good, Korean was clear winner for taste- it was excellent.  The drinks were distinctive and creative, but not great.  Our server was knowledgeable and prompt with service. Price was very reasonable for downtown and volume of food.  I understand why restaurants crank up the music (you drink more because you can't hear what other's are saying so you don't talk and it helps tables turn faster), but I just didn't like having to eat my tacos in silence because a conversation would be pointless.

It's pricey, for sure, but I thought the flavor and quality did not disappoint (unlike Butcher and the Rye, a sister restaurant, which I think I'm the only person in Pittsburgh to not be enamored with).  The waitress was very friendly, and if you like octopus (personally my favorite seafood), the tako taco is out of this world.  Reservations are highly recommended, and sometimes you might find yourself needing to plan a few weeks in advance to get one.  The only reason I wouldn't give a five-star rating is the seating.  If you're a party of two, you'll most likely be seated downstairs at the high-tops.  Not my preference, but typically not a problem.  The issue here is that the seating for the high-tops is just a stool with no back.  I get that it's to maximize space, but it's incredibly uncomfortable.  It was also chilly outside so I had a jacket, and I had to awkwardly ask the waitress if there was anywhere I could put it.  She kindly put it in a locker for me, but when, as a couple, you're dishing out $100+ by the time you have an appetizer, a few rounds of cocktails, tacos, and a tip, you tend to expect to at least be able to relax and enjoy the food a little more.",

You can watch the making of them in the open kitchen. The cocktails are fabulous. I had a sweet yellow roasted pepper margarita, also the cucumber margarita. The drinks are definitely creative.

It's very hip, eclectic and sexy. The music is a little loud upstairs but not a huge big deal. They have bar seats outside facing the open kitchen, along with some outdoor tables, which is a great set up on a beautiful day.   We ordered a little bit of everything from the menu and every single thing we ordered was excellent !!!!! The queso fundido, patayas, guacamole, salsa and the chicken, brisket and mushroom tacos.   I think this may be my new favorite place !!!",

My boyfriend and I have tried just about everything and go back as much as we can. For dinner time & sitting at a booth, you have to make a reservation online (which gets booked months in advance) but you can stop in when they open and its first come/first serve - the bar is always first come though. I recommend the yellow jacket margarita, any style of guac, and the al pastor & Korean tacos.",

I have dined with you several times and have always enjoyed it, however tonight was very upsetting. I had one of the featured items on the menu which was the smoked mushroom taco. I love love love mushrooms so I was very excited about this feature. However, I am extremely sensitive to spicy food. The menu listed smoked mushrooms, feta and cashew pesto and a mojo sauce (please forgive me of this is a little incorrect). All of this sounded amazing! As I took my first bite I was like ok something is a little spicy... I then had my second bite and my lips were tingly and my mouth was on fire. I asked the bartender what could be spicy and he had mentioned it had habanero on it. This is something I would have stayed away from or asked to not have it if I have known because I am extremely sensitive to spicy food. My husband who loves spicy food agreed it was a bit much. I unfortunately had to give him my second taco because I couldn't eat it. All i am suggesting is that the menu descriptions are a little more defined. Not everyone likes spicy peppers.",

There were 3 salsas, two of which were wonderful. The third,  salsa DE arbol was supposed to be spicy, but it was bland and not spicy at all. I ordered the Korean taco. The meat was cooked perfectly but the Korean sauce was extremely salty. The peanuts added a nice crunch but overall, it was an average taco. Another diner ordered the Baja tacos. They were also nothing special as far as fish tacos go. The highlight was the potatoes bravas. They were really flavorful and crispy. Overall, I felt slightly let down. Maybe too high of expectations,  or maybe there are too many other quality places to grab tacos, so I just wasn't impressed.",

So first off, as a warning to others, you probably should make an online reservation if you'd like to eat here at a table since this place is highly popular.   The service - Fantastic. All the waiters and waitresses seemed very informative and friendly.  The atmosphere - Great ambiance. Reminiscent of some bars in NYC with the dark lighting, booming music, and interesting decor.   The appetizer - Got the #3 guacamole order with smoked salmon. The taste was so light and fresh, and has a buttery consistency that melted in your mouth with each bite. When topped on their salted chip, it made a perfect complementary combination.    The food - Out of this world. You get 2 tacos per order which initially doesn't sound like much, but is actually incredibly filling. Their Chorizo tacos  ($12) are packed with meat, topped with a perfectly cooked, over-easy egg, and packed with flavor and spice. The Tako tacos ($16) though are an absolute must. You might think that octopus is not exactly the ideal meat for tacos, but it was far from chewy. In fact, you will never find an octopus grilled to tender perfection as the ones served here and deliciously cooked with a smokey taste.",

Over the span of my 5 visits I've had a chance to try the beet \"faux\" tartare, Ahi Tuna poki, octopus taco, fish taco, and the waygu short rib taco aka \"The korean\".  Out of everything I've tried what kept me going back was in fact the Korean.  I've only scratched the surface when it comes to trying everything on the menu but I now I can't go wrong with the Korean.  I prefer to sit outside in the stool but sometimes I've had to sit inside at the bar.  The service outside is lackadaisical - it's like they forget you're even there.    But it's worth seeing the chefs in action.  Sometimes it is tough to get a seat/table so plan ahead.",

So you are warned, make reservation. (unless you are on your own, then you can always fight your way to the bar table)  we had the fish taco and the Octopus (Tako) taco.  Honestly i am a bit disappointed.  The tako tasted like chicken than seafood.  I love seafood and have octopus a lot.  This is not bad, just different...  We had a sashimi starter too, it might be a special of the day.  I cannot find it on their online menu.  Well... too bad, cause it was actually pretty good.  At the end of the day, I just do not think the waiting time / reservation time is justified.  I do think it is overrated. and hence, the \"ok\" rating.

These were your gourmet tacos, not street tacos, and each taco order comes with 2 tacos- which are pretty huge.  We started with the Guacamole appetizer- you get a order sheet and check-off the mix-ins that you want. Loved the guacamole, and it came with a lot of chips. The Thrice Cooked Wings were also great- the meat just fell off the bone. The fish sauce taste was distinct, so if you don't like it, don't get it. The wings are given by weight when we asked about how many pieces, and this appetizer was enough for 4 people.   I got the Baja Taco- tempura white fish with cabbage, onion, radish and jalapeno relish. First thought- the fish is huge!! I loved the slaw on top of the fish, but overall, not really digging the taco overall. The fish was not as crispy as I would've liked, and it got a little soggy. Friends complimented the Bistec as well.",

    "text": "Came here for my birthday dinner and sat on the outside bar stools, giving us a great view of the chefs in action. I had a killer mezcal cocktail. I wasn't surprised that I loved it, as the cocktail program here is run by cocktail guru Maggie Meskey (formerly at Butcher & The Rye).  I really enjoyed the ambience, everything from music to the bustling crowd (which is usually not a plus - but somehow here it is) to the aesthetic. The vibe is also quite different indoors vs. out. Sitting indoors feels more hip and vibrant - like a real mexican taqueria meets club. Outdoors is more relaxed, and if you manage to snag a bar seat, watching the cooking unfold is a real pleasure.  We had two taco orders, the chorizo and the al pastor.  The tacos are high-quality, but I am not sure those specific ones we had lived up to the general hype of the restaurant.  Though I appreciated the fresh-made quality of the flour tortillas, the texture had a grittiness that I didn't prefer (for reference, I think the best homemade tortillas are at SMOKE Taqueria).  The al pastor tacos were pretty good, with inventive flavors that really worked well together.  I'd love to come back and try the carnitas -- my usual go-to taco.  But the real highlight of our meal were the patatas bravas.  If you like patatas bravas (or potatos and spicy food), GET THIS DISH.  They were the best I've ever had, ever.  Including patatas bravas I had in Madrid and Barcelona.  The spicy tomato sauce is absolutely to DIE for, and the aioli is a perfect complement.  I will be back for cocktails and more patatas bravas.  I'd love to try some of their other tacos next time.",

To start I had the passion fruit margarita which was sweet and spicy and plenty of tequila. We ordered the chips and the homemade guacamole which was with out doubt the best I've ever eaten Then we had the queso fundido which was spicy and rich and very tasty, two perfect apps for a table of 4. Then we all had the tacos.... I had the bestik which was waygo beef and spices outstanding my wife had the mushroom which was incredible and my kids both had the pollo which may have been just a bit too spicy for their tastes Some of the best tacos I've ever had, but the atmosphere made the meal! Cool music, cool art work and exceptional service. Our waiter Damian knew every bit of the menu and was super helpful this being our first time. He was fast and friendly and very knowledgable. Reservations are a must unless you sit outside on the sit up bar which fills up fast I can't wait to return to try every taco o the menu!",

For tacos, we go Carnitas and  Baja. Both are great! My all time favorite tacos are fish tacos, so I try fish tacos at every restaurant that offer them.

    "text": "Well, they've done it again... did you think they wouldn't? They, being Richard Deshantz and Tolga Sevdik, owners of Meat and Potatoes and Butcher and the Rye. I'm not joking when I say they've got this down to a science. Cook awesome food, offer a hip environment, great cocktails and you win.  I've been there a handful of times already, always sitting at the bar. Why? Because their cocktails are killer, yes, but also because I never think to make a reservation, which you must do at least two weeks in advance (maybe even three if you want a weekend date).   It's TINY, like really tiny! half the size of Butcher and maybe offering about 20 tables. So that's why you have to wait for a table and make a reservation. But TOTALLY worth it! The taco's aren't priced too bad, in my opinion. They're hardy and you get 2 for around $10ish. My fave so far... the mushroom taco. Sounds weird, but it was so delicious. The best way to experience a mushroom in my opinion. So good... I seriously dream about this taco!   I've also had their gauc, which come in various forms that you can choose from. I went with the classic, and while it was good, it's a tiny portion for around $8. I probably scooped half the bowl on one chip, which is partly my fault!   I'm excited to finally sit at a table soon, so watch out for a full dinner recap soon!",

First, the vibe is very cool and the decor is really spectacular. The service was fantastic and the drinks were excellent. I had the caparhinia and my friends got margaritas.  On to the food.. We started with the build your own guacamole, which was very good. Then we decided to share the taco board ( 6 pairs of tacos). We chose the tako, mushroom, al pastor, baja, carnita, and Korean. All of them were good. None of them were 4 or 5 star worthy. They relied way too much on creamy toppings so they all sort of tasted the same. It was disappointing. I might be back for drinks but the food is definitely not worth the long wait.",

They have an intense flavor and are on the salty side which I love, but be cautious if you're not a salt person. This Baja is a close second place for me. The mango crab gauc is my favorite thing on the menu. It's so delicious and never fishy at all, but a little spicy sometimes. Also all of the margs are great and definitely worth trying!

I had the best gauc I ever had with mangos and tons of crab meat.  My wife and I split a smoked salmon tostado which was the best smoked salmon I ever had. While this may sound crazy, we didn't get any tacos during this visit. We were stopping by after visiting a few other spots and already ate but were lucky to get a table (most of time time you need to reserve in advance) so we just had some apps.

However, my dining companion was nice enough to make a reservation for us, and when we were feeling like two old ladies and wanted to try to show up to sit earlier than our set reservation, they were surprisingly fine with it and let us sit right away. I think what makes it hard is if you show up with no reservation and a big group, as I saw several of those lingering by the door hoping to be seated.   While entering the restaurant you can peek in the window and see the cooks making fresh tortillas and I knew it would be a good taco experience because - let's be honest - so much depends on the tortilla! We went with the mushroom and Baja tacos, which were HUGE and though they're pricey for tacos (about $12-15), the ingredients are top quality and the portions are satisfying. We also got the guac and the street corn and starters, which was maybe not the smartest thing to do as it did fill us up, but both were delish as well!   We were having a non-drinking evening so the server offered to make us virgin versions of their watermelon basil  margarita and OMG - they were so refreshing and fresh!   As for the ambiance, it's very dark and loud and trendy, as I've mentioned, so maybe not the best place if you're in the mood for a romantic date or a chill conversation. It felt very see and be seen, but again the helpful service and the high quality food helped it live up to the hype.   Huge fan, hope I can return soon!",

I started with a spicy passion fruit margarita which was delicious and my mom got the standard blood orange, good, but I liked the libations of the day.   We wanted to try a few things on the menu so we got two appetizers and an order of Korean tacos, which was way more than enough for two people. We got the queso which was sooooo good and unique. It came with chips (hot, salty and crispy) and a few soft tortillas. The queso itself had flavorful beef, cilantro and some peppers in it. A little goes a long with with this stuff, you wanna eat more but it's so filling!   The papas are another app we got which seemed like crispy fingerling potatoes covered in the same stuff as the queso. Maybe we could have been more diverse, but still delicious and carb filled :)  Korean tacos were really good, but didn't stand out. Too much sauce.",

The tacos themselves however, were not good. I felt the octopus tentacle were not very fresh. The tentacles themselves tasted burnt to me, it was not cooked well. The whole taco, and what they put in it didn't match to me as well, the whole thing just tasted like a lot of burnt. I didn't like it at all.

Maybe it's because the tortilla chips were warm, but they were probably the best I've had. For dinner, I had the veggie tacos were really good. It was nice to have veggie tacos that didn't consist of vegetables normally found in a bag in the freezer section.

I ordered the spicy passion fruit margarita which was very interesting and different. Even the presentation of their drinks is awesome.  We started the meal off with the chips and salsa. All 3 were very good and some were a little spicy but it wasn't overwhelming. But let's talk about the tacos...most unique and flavorful tacos I've had. My friend and I ordered both the Korean tacos and the pollo asado tacos to share. The chicken tacos had great flavor and the chicken was not over cooked like chicken typically is. The Korean tacos were an interesting spin on a typical Mexican taco.   Overall I give tako a 5 star and I can't wait to go back and try more tacos!",

Almost everyone that worked there seemed exhausted and overwhelmed which is understandable given how dark, loud, and impossible to get around it was. We waited for about 15 mins to be asked about our drinks, and were able to order everything then. As I said, all of the food was very good as we had expected, but they need to make some overall adjustments to make this a pleasant dining experience.",

Both were fantastic, but I preferred the diablo as the watermelon was very very sweet. Then, we started with the queso, which was creamy  with a little bit of spice. My boyfriend and I both chose the pollo asado tacos for the main entree. AMAZING!   The portions were just the right size and we left feeling very satisfied. Our server was very accommodating and knowledgeable about celiac substitutions as well. The ambiance is very unique and fun. Overall we had a wonderful experience and will definitely be returning!",

After sitting down at the bar with my friend to order a drink, I asked if there were any drink specials. My friend and I were then told to look at the menu. Which didn't answer my question. We then were told to sit at the tables. We sat at the tables, as directed by the servers, and my group was passed over several times. A server approached us. We asked for drink menus, as it was already midnight and we were done with food and wanted to continue drinking. We were never brought menus. We were not treated with fair service and after spending 20 minutes in an atmosphere that we should have walked out of, we were finally brought waters we asked for upon arriving. I understand that this may have been an isolated incident. I wanted to show my out of town friends a good time, and considering this did not happen, I don't know if I will be coming back here.",

I called the restaurant at noon today to request our party of 2 at 730 be changed to 3 and was told that would require a larger table and seating couldn't be accommodated until 11pm. No exceptions. Instead of telling our friend he couldn't come, we showed up with 3 thinking it wouldn't be a big deal, but were told at the door that we can only sit outside when another party leaves. We ended up accepting, but thank god it wasn't a humid night. We were finally seated but the reservation restrictions leave a world to be desired.... especially when you need to book at least a month in advance for a Friday night. God forbid you have a last minute change of plans. Sorry to be a bitch, because this was inconvenient. The place isn't exclusive. When you boil it down, it's just another restaurant of many downtown and you can go elsewhere. The food is excellent, but it isn't THAT amazing. Just sayin.",

The menu selection was decent- there were definitely some arrangements of tacos I'd never considered before. But there are also some old standbys for those less adventurous in your party.    I had the chorizo taco complete with a fried egg- delicious but very messy. I also sampled the Korean and the duck confit - each offered their own unique taste- so it was tough to pick a favorite.   The night of our visit the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra was on strike and they played a few songs outside- a great addition to our meal!   Overall I enjoyed my visit- but in the end the price felt a little too steep for two taco plates.",

I am Mexican and I have complained there is no good place for tacos in this city,this guys made my night!! The only reason I don't give 5 is because in their location the bathroom is only one, little for a whole restaurant and it is as dark as the restaurant. Personally I don't like black toilets in a black low illuminated space because you can't see if it clean. Also the fact that men and women use same bathroom adds smells to the small WC.",

We had to wait three or four weeks just to get a reservation which caught my attention and I was told this is one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. So I went with an open mind. We got there and my first impression was not good the place is run down, dirty, dingy and not well lit. We ended up going up stairs and it was extremely hot and also we sat on wooden tables and benches....not exactly high end.  Also it is very loud.  The atmosphere definitely does not suggest fine dining but more well used, worn out drunken New Orleans.  Then the waiter came and got us some waters which by the way were warm. We questioned this and he responded \"you know it takes a while to chill water. I felt like responding \"you've heard of refrigeration haven't you\" but I kept an open mind.  Many in our party had Margaritas and mixed drinks which were good but the beer menu is rather flat and limited.  I ordered wings which I could not even finish as they were too sweet and sticky so much so I had to wash my hands three times in the rather unusual bathroom which I would not attribute to a higher scale restaurant.  I also had a mix of three sauces and chips which were okay but not impressive. I did try some of the tacos which were good but not worth the price...flat-out period.  Basically I can't understand what all the raving is about I would rate this place actually sort of a joke.  Food was okay but that's where it stopped everything else turn me off. I will never go back and I will continue to go to the so many better upscale places that deserve that kind of money that you pay in there. Sorry you didn't win my vote.",

I had the same server twice and she was very attentive in taking our orders and was patient when we had issues with deciding what to get and made wonderful suggestions for us!  The first time I went I had the Chorizo taco and it was the most flavorful, scrumptious, piece of taco heaven I have ever had. For the second time I had the Pollo Asado. It was a nice slightly charred piece of grilled chicken packed with all of the same other ingredients the chorizo taco had (minus the fried egg).   For the dessert we had the mint chocolate ganache. WARNING: the ice cream is very minty like the leaf. It's not your standard mint chocolate ice cream kind of deal which in my opinion is awesome. When it mixes with the dark chocolate and the blackberries it creates an odd bland flavor, but once it sits in it becomes somewhat of a masterpiece of flavors.  Also if you're wondering what the little dispenser is in the bathroom. It's a condom dispenser. We asked our waitress after having a 6 person dispute on whether or not it was a condom dispenser, a sticker dispenser, or a giant hoax that kept the customers in a perpetual state of curiosity, forcing people to spend the 4 quarters to find out the mystery.   Will definitely be coming here again to try out the guacamole and more of the delicious desserts!",

    "text": "So I'm Here in Pittsburgh for the week and decided to come downtown for a late night snack and drink with some co workers. We were going to some bourbon bar. Next door however... I see this funky dimly lit place playing notorious BIG and outside it says TAKO. Im intrigued instantly just by the music and the word Tako.. (I love tacos. For example if I was on death row and I could have one meal, it would be tacos.) so without hesitation or any permission from my co workers I just signal the \"hey we're going in here first\" face. Pretty packed but we manage a seat at the bar and we are just FLOORED by their tequila selection.   So this awesome bartender, Caito, makes us all these wonderful tequila based craft cocktails that we just absolutely loved! Then we order chips with a trio of salsas and Mexican corn to start. Both amazing!  We were so impressed and I was shocked there wasn't many yelp reviews so I asked Caito how long have they been open and she replies... \"Since Tuesday\" holy balls they just opened and I just happened to find it randomly?! I love random amazing finds!  SO THEN THE TAKOS. We tried just a few; The carnitas, the al pastor, chorizo, and fish. Favorite was carnitas and al pastor. Amazing flavors, well marinated meat cooked to perfection, and fresh made buttery soft tortillas. Chorizo taco was good and had a fried egg which was awesome but it was just a little overwhelming and I wasn't in the mood for breakfast. Fish taco was good could use a little more flavor but I'm also not a big fish fan.   I'm from California and I'm part Mexican and these were some of the best tacos I've ever had and in Pittsburgh. WTF. They were a little expensive but still very tasty. Very good quality and very good flavor. They come in orders of two and the price ranges from about $10-$14. We're probably coming back tonight or tomorrow. I can't wait!",

    "text": "Visited here expecting an incredible meal and tako certainly delivered just that!   The spicy passion fruit margarita was sweet, tangy, and spicy! Very delicious. For the meal, we had the original \"tako\" taco, which is an octopus taco and also the special, which was an Asian inspired pork belly taco. The octopus was so tender; you never would've known it was octopus! The fried chickpeas on it were also delicious. But I must say, the pork belly taco blew it out of the park!! It was cooked perfectly, the veggies were crisp and tangy, the kimchi was a perfect addition to the rock pork belly, and the sweet miso glaze paired well! Overall, the tacos were great.   We also had the street corn, which was rich and good for sharing! The queso fundido was also delicious, and was also topped with their homemade chorizo and peppers that were delectable! The only complaint was that there a little bit too much cilantro on the queso, but that can be easily overlooked with all the other amazing qualities of the meal. The service was awesome as well!!! Definitely will go back and would recommend to anyone looking to try unique, delicious, and interesting good in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "What is there not to love about Tako?! Seriously, it's one of the most unique spots in Pittsburgh. I can appreciate the level of detail that went into this restaurant. The dimmed lights allow for an intimate dining experience! I love the seats outside that allow you to watch the chefs cook your meal and that is something I want to do in the future. The chandelier's are GORGEOUS and so are the murals on the walls.  I have been here twice and after my first time I wanted my mom to see what the hype was about. So far I have had the Korean taco, the al pastor and the pollo asada. Honestly I couldn't even tell you my favorite because they were all so delicious and unique. The different ingredients mixed together really just produced some of the best flavor. The tacos are a pretty nice size for what you pay. I am pretty picky when it comes to taco shells and these shells are just the right amount of soft. They are not dry which is a pet peeve of mine and most importantly they held all the ingredients together without breaking. My mom was pretty pleased with her visit! She ordered the Korean taco and we ordered the chips and salsa to start. I would like to try the duck confet and the chorizo taco at my next visit! I highly recommend tako if you want to be wowed by amazing tacos! Oh and make sure you make a reservation, at least a week or two in advance.",

    "text": "After a failed attempt without reservations (2 hour wait?!), we got our stuff together and planned ahead.  Totally worth it!    The place is way bigger than it looks and very different from what you'd assume if you were just looking at the part you can see from the street (the open kitchen with the outdoor barstools).   Inside, it's dark and dungeon-ish, but in a very attractive way.  The octopus sconces, iron and wood decor, and Mexican candles lend the place a really fun vibe.     The food was amazing.  We ordered the queso and two special taco plates.   One of the specials was shrimp with a bunch of deliciousness including pistachios.  It was a great fresh combo and I definitely wish it was on the regular menu.  The other special was a cheesesteak taco.  This was not your average cheesesteak - tender strips of actual steak - not the processed pressed stuff you think of when you think cheesesteak.   Both specials were absolutely delicious!   Each plate came with two tacos, which was a pretty good portion for the price and quality.     The queso appetizer was really the only thing I had a comment about.   The queso itself was awesome.   The soft tortillas it was served with were awesome.  The combo, though, was a little awkward.  Do you make a very cheesy burrito?  Try and dip/scoop with the soft tortilla?  We tried it a bunch of different ways; but in the end, we kind of just wanted some chips to scoop up all that rich and creamy queso.     Service?  Also excellent.  Our server was prompt, attentive, and friendly.   As an added bonus, we asked where the restroom was on the way out.  He pointed us in the direction, but took the time to tell us that there was a big line and we'd be better to try the one in the attached Butcher and the Rye (see my review of that place for why there was no line there).     Overall, a sure winner and I'll definitely be back.",

We are in town to see a baseball game and sitting next to us were two players from the Cardinals (I didn't recognize them but my husband was very excited). Anyway, we got the carnitas and pastor tacos and they were SO GOOD! I'm a big fan of carnitas but I always hesitate to order them when I'm out because a lot of places make them so oily and fatty. These were perfect- hardly any fat (just enough to be tasty) and simultaneously chewy and crispy. The street corn was the best I've ever had. I wish I was in Pittsburgh more often!",

The food was great but service could have been better so I took off one star for that.   Our server seemed so annoyed every time she had to check on us - we didn't have any complaints or extra requests, btw. Just margs, two apps, and the tako tacos. Also, I mentioned to the staff that we were celebrating my birthday (I was overly excited) and they didn't do anything. Now, I wasn't expecting any kind of Applebee's song and dance but maybe just a \"happy birthday\" or small piece of dessert? Nope. Kind of rained on my parade ):  The atmosphere was trendy and hip which we really enjoyed. I didn't feel that the lighting was too dark like some people have mentioned. We really liked the DJ instead of boring dinner music and it wasn't so loud that it interrupted regular dinner conversation.  Overall, great food and atmosphere but their service didn't really seem to match on the Saturday night we visited.",

Luckily, we made a reservation for an early dinner - so there was no wait and no crowd.  Although service was a bit slow for so early in the evening, the food was out of this world. For an appetizer, we had street corn (grilled corn, siracha mayo, cojito cheese, scallions, lime), which was as good or better than any street corn I ever had in Arizona. For dinner, my hubby had salmon tacos (blood orange, goat cheese, pistachio vinaigrette) - and said they were the best fish tacos ever. I had pork belly tacos (cucumber, asian BBQ sauce, grilled bok choy) - and wish I could have had room to eat more! The flavors of the tacos were perfect.  The ambiance of tako is also part of the experience. The interior is impeccably designed; and, the DJ was spinning some classic '90s hip hop.   Overall, I highly recommend the food at tako!",

    "text": "After months of talking about going to tako with my fiance, we finally were able to get reservations for a Friday night at 7:15. We both were so excited to finally experience all the hype surrounding tako. We arrived right on time and immediately seated at our table. I was already impressed by the vibe and decor of the restaurant. We both ordered drinks and put in our appetizer order while we tried to figure out the difficult task of which tacos to order. I ordered the Violet Pilot and she ordered the Watermelon Basil Margarita. I thoroughly enjoyed my drink. It wasn't too sweet, and I could really taste the smokiness of the mezcal at the end. (I love to try variations of drinks that have egg whites as an ingredient). She was happy with her margarita as well.  We ordered the Queso Fundido as an appetizer. It was a tough decision between that or the Papa Bravas. The Queso Fundido was a great choice and I would definitely consider ordering it again. It came with four little tortillas. It was a great combination of cheese and chorizo and all the flavors were a great start to an amazing meal.  Now onto my favorite part of the meal and what I was most anticipating: the tacos. I ordered the Chorizo and she ordered the Baja. (She tends to never to be able to finish her meal, so I was excited and looking forward to trying both kinds of tacos). These tacos were hands down the best I've ever had. The Chorizo tacos blew my mind and I enjoyed every single bite! I loved how they incorporated a fried egg on the taco; the yolk added a lot of extra flavor! As anticipated, she was full and gave me her last Baja taco. It was very flavorful! I feel that the slaw on the taco brought all the flavors together and it was a nice touch. However, the Chorizo taco was definitely my favorite so far! I can't wait to come back to try all the other varieties that they have to offer!  Our bill came out to be $60 (plus tip) for two drinks, an appetizer, and two entrees. I felt our meal was definitely worth the cost. Yes, it can get pricey quick and I see how everyone says it can be expensive.  tako is now one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh and I look forward to returning!",

    "text": "Okay, so while the food is freaking fantastic, they need better guidance or better directions on how to get people to use the bar space which is in front of the open kitchen. There were 5 seats available and a note that said to see the host - but I couldn't for the life of me figure out where the host was located. So I finally interrupted one of the chefs and was told to go inside. once inside, host station was easy to find, and I got led outside. Then I waited, and finally interrupted the chef nearest my seat if I gave him my order. Nope, a server would come!  Admittedly when my server came, he was awesome, but its confusion and I found myself explaining the process to the new folks who joined me at the bar. I'm still giving them a 5 star tho' because the food and service were so superior, the initial confusion of how my dining experience started is a quibble.  So on to my menu selections - I got a Red Sangria ($8) which had Brandy, Orange and citrus, based on servers recommendation that it drank smoother. Gosh, this was stronger than I expected - the brandy packed a punch, but super delicious.  - For my first taco, I had to try their namesake so got octopus, harissa aioli, preserved lemons, mizuna greens and herbs plus pickled red onion. The octopus pieces were super generous ad incredibly tender. This was a delight to eat from the 1st bite to the last. Well worth the price tag!  - My next taco was the duck confit - hoisin, scallions, cucumbers, pickled peppers, mint and cilantro. One disadvantage of sitting at the bar is that your eyes feel bigger than your stomach - I saw the chef prepping the duck leg, and it looked so lovely with that dark rich red flesh, I knew I wanted to taste some. One caveat, if you are a wuss with chilies like me, get the pickled peppers on the side - those suckers were massively hot! Another winner on the menu.  - Dessert was Tres Leches to go, lovely rich peaches & creama! Fantastic heavenly smell and each bite was deliciously awesome. I'd get this again!  So, each taco comes x2, and you cant substitute/ mix or match and I ended up taking one of the duck confit tacos back to the hotel - it held up to the next day eating standard, as did the Tres Leches.  One other thing - these guys make the soft tacos in house! With the bar being in front of the open kitchen, I realized one chef's station was set up where he was breaking off pieces of dough, putting it into a taco maker machine and then cooking it! So everything was super freshly cooked and made!!  Lucky Pittsburgh, to have such a fantastic and awesome place to go eat at. Highly recommend and will absolutely return when am next back in Pittsburgh!  Note: #331 of Yelp 100 challenge for 2016",

The atmosphere, the service, and omg the food. You could tell these people really pride themselves on this place. We had a couple beers, i think one had sea salt? It went perfectly with our al pastor tacos. The tacos were big enough to share! And the mexican corn.... i could swim in it. So delicious! Incredible experience",

In the summer they have 5 or so seats  to sit at . 2 tacos a board. Great to go with a few friends as you can swap tacos as they are two to an order.  Cool ambience, fast service, good cocktails, creative tacos.  My favs are the papas bravas app( never disappoints)  Korean ( a must have) , El Pastor, and the Chorizo tako are good choices .  EL Diablo cocktail is also a nice addition to your meal .  Enjoy!",

    "text": "When I ate the first bite of my tuna belly guacamole, my first thought was to write a yelp review. Holy guacamoley it was good. Never would you think tuna, nori and some other combo of japanese seasonings would go together with guac.  After that, we ordered one of their appetizer specials - shrimp ceviche, which was also a-mazing. In fact, because we were so enticed by our appetizers, my friend and I had even forgotten to order our entrees.   At this point, I was feeling a little full since I had some food beforehand. That spicy kimchi caramelized pork belly taco though. The moment my taste buds experienced this delectable substance (yes, substance because there must be crack in this), I knew there was no turning back. It's a shame it was only a special. Although the al pastor taco could not compare to the pork belly taco, it was still pretty good.   Drinkwise, I got Ramon's gin fizz, which is not bad for a creamer based drink (which I learned I don't seem to like) and my friend got the Hennessy Sidecar, which is a pretty solid cocktail.  This place is hands down my favorite restaurant at the moment. No pictures were taken this time (the lighting is ridiculously dark imo) but expect some when I go back to visit!",

After that with the only vegetarian taco option I requested if we could replace goat cheese with some other cheese and the server replied in a crisp manner \"no\".

Let me tell you, all of those expectations were blown away. When we first walked in, the first thing I noticed was the loud music, but the decor was spectacular! The malaria as were delicious, nut the food was really the star of our meal.  The tako tacos (octopus) were our favorite dish, followed closely by the Korean tacos and the poke (which included some of their delicious guacamole!). The server was very helpful and friendly. We were surprised by how quickly the food arrived at our table. Overall awesome meal, I will definitely be back!",

It's nice that you get three favors if salsa for the price.   We inquired about the \"Board,\" which includes 6 pairs of tacos for $75. The catch was you had to order 6 different types of tacos (so no option to get 2 chicken, 3 steak, and 2 fish...etc) and you couldn't order off the specials menu.   The chicken taco was delicious. The ingredients were super fresh. The steak taco was good too. Would order both again.   The service was pretty slow, but our table was up on the second floor and the place was packed. The atmosphere was great, so we really didn't mind.   Definitely a cool spot in downtown Pittsburgh, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Condado - right down the street, just as cool of an atmosphere, and half the price. It's a great budget-friendly substitute.",

(Note, they do not take orders over the phone).  The place has a cool urban vibe, dim with accent lighting in the main area in the back, and a fun open kitchen concept with bar seating right on the front pavement, reminiscent of an Asian street food stall.   The taco, while bigger than the average street taco and topped with chicharon, was overpriced and greasy with liquid. I wish they had drained some of that off first.   For $10 though, I thought the wings were pretty good. Not authentic but a good balance of salty and sweet.  In my opinion I've had much better tacos in California and Mexico, but maybe if it was less greasy I'd give it another shot.",

I'm not a huge queso fan, and they served it with soft flour tortillas which I would have preferred chips. I got the Korean tacos and my boyfriend got the carnitas. The Korean tacos were very good and different. They fried the skirt steak which is not what I was expecting, and I wasn't a huge fan of the texture. Something about the chewiness of the steak combined with fried batter did not sit well with my taste buds. But the flavors were very nice--kind of peanutty & very Asian inspired. The carnitas were amazing. I would get those if I went back. I also got a classic margarita which was very refreshing. There are a lot of comments about how expensive this place is, and I would agree that it is proxy. It is a nice casual date night spot, and they serve 2 tacos with every order. The tacos are also huge (I had to eat some of the filling before I could wrap it into an actual taco that fit into my mouth). They really load them up, so you get the bang for your buck which I appreciate at the very least.",

Man, they didn't even have the music too loud to talk. I'm in love and am determined to usher everyone who visits Pittsburgh to these doors.",

    "text": "Popped in late night and we tried the korean taco's and carnitas.  They had a tequila extra anejo special which we definitely ordered multiple rounds of.  The carnitas taco was nicely done.  They cook and then grill one side so you get some crunch to it.  By the way, these things are large and you get 2 of each.  The korean taco, we had mixed emotions.  The description made it sound scrumptious, but when someone uses the korean reference, I am looking for specific things to emulate korean cooking (I am korean too).  There was a little bit of spice, but the meat just didn't have much flavor and a few bites were more like freeze dried meat.  So it was a meh.  The manager was awesome and took those off the bill and we had a nice chat.  Definitely took advantage of the tequila special and still spent $100 on the bill.  Will definitely come back and try some of the other tacos on the menu",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I made reservations a month in advance to have dinner on a Saturday night here, and it was by far one of the worst experiences either of us have had a restaurant.  Our reservations were for 6:30. We arrived and were seated right away. Got our drinks, ordered guacamole, all seemed well until about 6:55 when we finally got ahold of our waiter to put in another drink order and place our dinner order. There is where it all started going downhill - 7:20 rolls around, we haven't gotten our tacos yet, but the table next to us (who got seated after us) got their tacos. We flagged down our waiter, asked him to check on our order, he goes to the kitchen and comes back and says \"there was a mix up in the kitchen, remind me of what you ordered.\" At this point, he probably forgot to put in our order, which is fine if he would have admitted it.   Now it's 7:30, still no sign of our tacos, our waiter comes and takes the table on the other side of us' order. A few more minutes go by, still no tacos. I asked for the check around 7:35 because we had somewhere to be after dinner and it would have been quicker to pay in advance. When it turned 7:45, we didn't have our tacos or our check, but the table next to us got their dinner, and I'm pretty sure flames starting shooting out of my head. Our waiter finally brought our check around 7:50 and I know he could tell I was furious; he asked if we wanted our tacos to go or if we still wanted to dine in, and we got them to go because we no longer wanted to sit in this restaurant. 7:55, we paid, left, and ate our tacos on the side of the road while waiting for our Uber.  Needless to say, we will not be returning to Tako. For as many great reviews that this place has, I was so disappointed at the experience we had on Saturday.",

If you're looking for tacos like what you'd find for $1.50 on the side of the road in Texas, this is not the spot for you. But if you're looking for gourmet tacos that's do justice to the word taco, you've found a good spot.  First, the atmosphere is great for a date, but if you want to try all the courses, it'll cost you. We spent over $100 just for two people. Granted the octopus tacos were mind-blowing even at $11 each. And I don't even like octopus. Also the tres leches is a must.   If you want a dish that won't break the bank, go for the street corn. It's gooey and delicious and pretty damn close to what I'd order every Friday night from the corn ladies standing outside Fuel City Gas Station in Dallas.",

The only downside, in my opinion, was the service. We had a larger group, which isn't optimal for tako's space. Our waiter seemed a bit annoyed by that. He was constantly coming to our tables and nearly pushed us out of the restaurant. But the food made up for it, so we were not to hung up on the less-than-desirable service.   A tip: be sure to make a reservation, since the space is quite small.   Looking forward to my next time at tako!",

    "text": "I was very disappointed in my meal here. A friend and I went, knowing it would be expensive but hoping great flavor would make up for it. We got two different kinds of taco (so 4 tacos total). We got the octopus taco and pastor taco.   The Octopus taco is what they're known for, so I was excited to try it. I ended up not being able to finish it because I couldn't get past the texture of the octopus, and I didn't feel like it had a ton of flavor. I really enjoyed the pastor taco, it had good flavor and I really enjoyed the citrus/pineapple flavor. We got the tacos on corn tortillas instead of the classic flour, and I enjoyed those as well. I thought the flavor complemented the flavor of the pastor taco well.  I am glad I came here and got to experience it, but over all I would say the food is not worth the money. Bakersfield was pretty close to just as good but at a way cheaper price. We spent $44 on 4 tacos when you add tip and tax, and I was so hungry after that I had to buy a whole other dinner somewhere else. I did only eat about 1 and 1/3 of a taco, but I don't think eating the whole second taco would have made me any less hungry.",

The food (and margaritas are exceptional) but the prices aren't the best since you only get two tacos. At the same time, I always leave very full after the two tacos so not sure the quantity matters. Something else to keep in mind is that you will not find your \"average\" taco here so you need to be prepared for that or else you will leave disappointed. We always order the chips and guacamole as an appetizer to start. The chips are so light and crunchy. I also love their spicy and coconut margaritas (they change some of them out from time to time).   Overall: highly recommend to try at least once. I suggest making a reservation beforehand because the place is always packed and you might not get a table to 9 or 10pm without a reservation.",

I made them a few weeks before and my options were 5pm or 9pm ugh! Anyways it all worked out because I was hungry at 5 anyways! We started out with the chorizo queso dip which is to die for. Would seriously eat it as part of a last meal if I was given the choice. Then we ordered the korean tacos and the shrimp tempura tacos. Both were delicious!!! I think I liked the shrimp just a little bit more.  I ordered a glass of champagne with my meal and they were not light on the pour--- another bonus.  The only reason I do not give them 5 stars is the fact that its a little pricier and I wish it was easier to get the reservation time that you want. Other than that the food and service is an A++.",

We stopped in last night and were told they were at a 2 hour wait and weren't taking any more names for the list. We decided to try out luck at the bar, and luckily we managed to get two seats out of the four we needed. The bartender was so nice and attentive! I wish I got her name because she was awesome! The prices here are a little high but everything is delicious so it's worth it. Except for the $14 guacamole... not sure why it's that much (even tho we did order it ) We were all happy with our assortment of margaritas. We decided to get the taco platter - $95 for 12 tacos. The steak tacos were our favorite.",

The drinks and food were great but Todd, our server, made the experience amazing.  He recommended items and was extremely attentive.  We had a few drinks and the Korean tacos- best tacos I have had (and we have tried a lot of tacos).  Very creative with their flavors.  We had such a great experience we came back for dessert later that evening and Todd remembered us!  Woohoo to Todd's outstanding personality and service.  We had the Churros and again amazing.  tako- we will be back and we live 300 miles away!  This place made an impression!",

    "text": "You definitely need to check this place out. We had to make reservations for six people a couple of weeks before. It was definitely worth the wait. The place itself is small and very dark which I wasn't a big fan of. The menu is literally a newspaper! I thought that this concept was pretty neat.   For appetizers, we ordered chips and salsa, street corn and guacamole. The best one was the street corn, hands down!! It was really creamy and the corn just made it taste so amazing! The guacamole was also one of my favorites. It was really tasty and different than the other guacamoles that I've tried elsewhere. We wanted to get the taco sampler which was 6 pairs of tacos for $65, however, you can only select different tacos and cannot repeat any flavors. Therefore we ended up ordering individually as everyone seemed to want the Korean tacos and we shared one to try another flavor. I ended up with one Korean taco and one Tako (octopus) taco. They were both delicious! I was surprised that the tako one was actually tender and not chewy. The tacos are not that big but definitely flavorful.   I definitely enjoyed my experience but these tacos are quite pricey for the amount of food. I also didn't like the super dark atmosphere to the point that you couldn't really see what was inside your food. There is only one bathroom in the restaurant and when I used it, the floor was all wet.",

    "text": "My father made reservations for 7 people a few weeks in advance. The earliest they could seat us was 11:00pm. So we treated it as a late night snack, rather than dinner. When we arrived the hostess said we could only have 6 people at a table. She didn't know why someone would have made a reservation for 7, so they weren't very thrilled. Luckily, after a short wait, they seated us all in an upstairs booth, with a chair on the end. It was honestly nice for them to still accommodate us, since that's not restaurant protocol.   Side note: I'm not sure why the earliest reservation was 11pm, since the upstairs was totally empty. So that was a little annoying to know we could have been there much earlier and actually had a nice dinner. Clearly whoever made the reservation didn't know what they were doing.  They had a DJ playing (also upstairs) and it was so loud! We couldn't really talk to each other and our waiter (who was awesome) couldn't hear our orders very well. It was so dark that we used our flashlight apps to read the menu, more of a joke, than a necessity, but it still made it 1000x easier. I loved the way the menu was presented, on newspaper paper. Despite how loud it was, I loved the dark vibe. The decor is so cool, octopus theme, low red lighting, and so unique to Pittsburgh. Another place that made me feel like I was in some real-life TrueBlood scene, if only you replaced the vampires on the show with octopus.   When it came to the food, I ordered the Baja fish tacos to share and a Pineapple Jalapeno Margarita. Also we shared an order of guacamole. Not sure what kind we had, since I couldn't hear them order.  Honestly, the food was amazing!! Best fish tacos in the city, end of story. I expect to come back here within the next month if I can stand to wait that long.",

Usually with a group of friends, we have used the online reservation system to be sure we have a seat. The upstairs seating is private and fun - with booths big enough for our party of 6.  I allowed others to take the lead on ordering, so we had a variety of takos. The Chicken was my favorite, with great flavor and delicious corn tortillas. They also have a variety of bar drinks -- good beer list, mixed drinks, and my go-to for the night was a Moscow Mule. Great option.  I also like that they have the outdoor bar for nice weather seating. I haven't been lucky enough to grab a seat there, but it looks great having a direct view into the kitchen to watch the magic happen. Hopefully when summer comes around again I'll find my self bellied up to the bar with a taco in hand!",

    "text": "Came here again now with reservations on a Wednesday night at 9 pm. It definitely was better sitting inside, because the decor has some cool vibes. My friend and I started off with the street corn and the #5 guacamole. The guac came pretty quickly and had crab, mango, and habanero peppers in it. The crab was jumbo lump and fresh and the mango was a nice addition. The corn was also spicy and flavorful just not a huge fan of cojita cheese.   For dinner, we had the Korean taco and the chorizo taco. The Korean taco was delicious and had a nice sweet and spicy flavor. The chorizo taco was good as well but could have used more of a crunch. I would recommend coming later on a weeknight, because it really was not that busy and we were in an out in about an hour.",

    "text": "These tacos were some of the best gourmet tacos I have seen had. They had delicious fillings and great toppings. I had the octopus tacos because when at tako, you have to get the tako tacos. They were good, but not the best I've had. The octopus was cooked very well, however the chickpea topping wasn't great. They were roasted, so they were hard. I get the idea of adding the roasted chickpeas for added crunch, however I think there could have been a better way to do that. I did have a bite of my friend's chicken tacos though and OMG. Probably the best chicken taco I have ever had. It was spicy (YAS) and juicy. They were some great tacos. The guacamole is also quite good, and I'm not a quac eater. I will definitely be going back to tako when I get a chance. It's a problem that you have to make a reservation at least a week in advance, for a decent time for dinner.  But that just means it's worth it.",

Love the dark design of this place, and all of the lighting is unique and effective. We shared the pastor, Korean, and octopus tacos. The Octopus would have been a winner but the sauce was just too salty. That being said, the food was delicious, and the tortillas were great (and I'm a South Texas native who knows tacos). I can't wait to come back and try more things on the menu--and get Korean again. It is worth the hype. Try a black daiquiri if you are interested in a sweet drink.",

We waited 45 minutes for a table, but wandered around downtown in the meantime until we got the text that our table was ready.   The food was delish, though slightly pricey. For about $12, you get two tacos of various toppings. We all decided that if there were 3 tacos to a portion, this place would be perfect. While delish, $6 for a taco is definitely pricey.   We tried the baja fish tacos, octopus, and the duck. The duck tacos were the unanimous favorite with their tangy sauce, but all were fantastic. Get the duck tacos if it's your first time, they were out of this world.   If I get the chance, I'll definitely come here for some late night eats, but with a reservation.",

Two themes I have picked up on from both visits. 1: each of the waitstaff we encountered were not that friendly.  On my last visit I ordered my tacos minus one item and someone else at the table ordered the same type.  When the server brought them up, he failed to mention which one was missing the item and I ended up finding out after a single bite.  The server was not quick to remake them, telling me \"you should have told him that you ordered yours without\".   They did make new ones but in 30 years, I've never been told that it was my fault the server didn't communicate to the food runner.  Theme 2: they never ask if you want more drinks.  Not sure why but both times we had to ask for another round.  At $10 each, with 4 of us in our party wouldn't it make sense to try for another $8 in tip? Especially if it's before the main food arrives.  Volume volume volume seems to be the gameplan, given the size of the venue. Suggest you Try it a few times and then wait for someone to open up a bigger place with a nicer staff and lower prices.  Only a matter of time.",

So, I can't speak to the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant so much as I can say that it's fun watching the crew make tortillas and tacos in the fishtank kitchen area they have going on.  I ordered the mushroom tacos because I had eaten a large snack before I went out (not knowing if food was going to be involved for the evening), and wasn't hungry for my usual standard starter of carnitas tacos when trying out a new taco joint.  I must say, I was pretty blown away by those mushrooms.  Don't let their veggie status fool you--they are pretty substantial.  And tasty.  One friend got another type of taco and though I can't remember which one she got, I do remember her liking it.  My other friend ordered ceviche, and the chips that came with it were self-replenishing, I swear.  We all three were picking at those, and there always seemed to be more!  The one thing I really wasn't super impressed with were the cocktails.  The first one I ordered was advertised as being \"stupid spicy\", and I tasted more mix than anything.  Spice level = 0, which is what I affectionately call \"Pittsburgh spicy\".  The second cocktail was better, but not particularly memorable.  I would definitely re-visit this place with a proper res, if for no other reason than that I'm a fan of this restaurant group and a sucker for tacos.",

First off - the staff and service at Tako is the best.  We have always had reservations (i don't recommend going without them), and have always been promptly seated.    Second off - the food.  I've done a variety of things for appetizers - specialty quac, queso, salsa - all of which is amazing.  They are always willing to bring extra chips too!  My fav - thus far - is the Korean tacos.  I have tried a few of the others, but once I tried the Korean tacos - I was sold.  No need to try others!  They are the best.    Just a note to future patrons - you get 2 tacos per order.  I would suggest you and your friend get 2 different kinds, then you can share!  It's the best way to try multiple tacos!",

They have a good amount of tables to sit at outside, as well as a out door(on the side walk)bar. We had a reservation. It was very busy, but were sat immediately...after my bud arrived (read the bottom). It took a few minutes for our server to greet us, but he was very nice and had a good sense of humor, so I'll let that pass.     The menu was not very big, which I like, so it was easier to choose what we wanted. And the server was knowledgeable of everything we asked about the menu. We chose the street corn and the chips and salsa to start. The street corn was amazing! The sauces that drenched the corn were very tasty and had a lil kick and taste of lime to them. The corn cob itself was cooked just right. I only wish they had served them with little knobs so that it would have been easier and less messy to eat (cuz I like to be a lady). The chips were served with three salsas (a hot red pepper/tomato, a medium/verde(green) salsa, and a mild tomato salsa. I enjoyed the hot salsa so much, I requested a to go order of it. The chips themselves were nice and crispy and not stale. You can tell they were not store bought.   I also ordered the cucumber margarita. This is a margarita I will forever love. The tequila was not over powering, yet the cucumber stood out, giving a very refreshing taste to it. Loved this drink!    Finally, the chicken tacos (pollo asado). There were two served on a wood plank( nice touch). The chicken was not dry and was marinated well with a hard grilled taste. They were served atop of soft tortillas, covered with diced white onion, salsa verde, queso fresco, a sweet taste crema, serreno, and cilantro. It all came together very well.    Although the food was very tasty, and the atmosphere was nice and warm, and the server was very nice I will stand by my four star on simply that I did not find the bathroom situation very appealing (being that there was one and it was right next to the bar), as well as the hostess with the mostest was not so much. I was given the cold shoulder for a good 2 minutes, even after being seen by a fellow server and still not addressed until my other half arrived. Made my beginning moments of the place very skeptical. However, I will fancy myself to come back. The food was good and I enjoyed the ambiance.",

But besides that the food was perfect! Started with the chips and salsa, which comes with a selection of 3 different salsas..all very good! They also have a \"build your own\" guacamole menu! LOVE IT! I've never been to a restaurant where you can pick whatever you want to add to your guacamole dip. Ordered the basic guacamole and added mangoes and fried onions. Delicious! Also ordered the fish tacos which were so good. The fish was nice and crispy, not greasy and lots of flavor in the taco. I do wish they sold their tacos individually instead of 2 per order. That way you can order 2 different types of tacos instead of getting 2 of the same thing.  You can never have too many taco joints around the city and I really hope Tako sticks around!",

The chips are very good and so is the guac. I still give Bakersfield the win on guacamole in Pittsburgh. However, holy smokes are the tacos ahhhhmazing. Tried the Al Pastor and the Baja. The Baja will delight you!  It has a bit of heat, sweet, and an absolutely wonderful rendition of tartar sauce that will rock your socks. The Al Pastor is pork shoulder, pineapple, and other delicious concoctions. The winner of the two for me would be the Baja. I will update my review once I try more dishes, but Tako is a winner and will not disappoint...a must try!  ----  Guess who's back with an update?  The street corn. Just go get you some. Ahhhhmazing. Holy. Does Jesus work in this kitchen?  When I say I want some of this everyday of my life, I'm not kidding you.   The chicken taco has now blown my Baja taco out of the first place ranking. Insanely delicious. Just try it. No regrets. I promise.   Service was stellar (Jason) and my company made the night all the more memorable. Tako is CONTINUALLY wonderful.

The host was super cool and made room for us at a table that was between reservations. Definitely over the top in costumer service. Wait staff was also great!  We went for the Pittsburgh Winter Restaurant Week Deal (Chips, Guac, red or verde salsa; choice of 2 apps; and choice of 2 tacos). The salsa verde (tomatillo) was rich and smoky and I definitely recommend. Other apps (guac, papas bravas, and ceviche) were also delicious. For dinner, We chose the Korean Beef BBQ taco and the Al Pastor Taco. Korean taco was very good, but the Al Pastor was fantastic!! I definitely recommend getting that one for sure! For dessert they had 3 options, but one sounded the most unique and we got that one (because why not!?) It was a chocolate bread pudding, with espresso/chocolate sauce, brownie bits sprinkled on top, bananas foster, and house-made Mexican chocolate ice cream... That was all in one dessert!!!! It was big enough to split (but small/good enough to finish even after a huge meal).  I plan to go back and explore the other taco options, because they all looked amazing!",

    "text": "We tried to get a seat as walk-ins on the first night, bad idea. So we went to Butcher next door and I grumped about it. I was a little salty but I came by for a second attempt on night number 2. We waited just a few minutes and somehow managed to get a table. Maybe they could tell I was desperate. The ambience is fantastic and for being the second night the service was flawless.   We had several types of margaritas. I really liked the frozen passion fruit but if you like cachaca try the pineapple Batida. The custom guacamole is an awesome concept and adding that perfectly cooked bacon along with mango and pineapple was mind altering. The chips were hot and salty and perfect.   Next came the wings... In a fish sauce caramel. OMG. They're everything I could ever ask for and reminded me of the first fish sauce wings I had at PokPok. All of the tacos were delicious but perhaps a little spicy for the average palate. I like spicy, so a lot of them ended up on my plate. The beef in the Korean taco melted in my mouth and the duck confit was superb. I am so happy I didn't let me first turn away experience stop me. I'm really excited to have a new place to enjoy downtown.",

I would recommend the Tako!",

    "text": "FINALLY.  I get to review this place after my first, long awaited visit!!!  Bobby and I always want to come in, but every time I call it's last minute and the only open reservations are at 10-11pm!  I guess that's a great problem to have as a restaurant!  So Bobby called three weeks in advance to make a reservation for a Tuesday night for my birthday dinner.  He took the 9 oclock reservation for last night.  We were seated right away by the host wearing a fabulous pair of printed leggings, fur poncho and big floppy hat!  The place was completely packed...about 8-10 tables plus bar seating on the first floor and another level of tables upstairs - all full.  Our server - didn't catch his name and no nametag - was really good.  Not overbearing or over the top friendly but not at all standoffish or rude.  He got to the point with explaining the menu and what is popular and made sure we were taken care of for the entire meal.  To start, we split the guac appetizer (#5, which we were told is most popular) with crab, pickled habaneros, pineapple and lime.  It was very good and didn't need any salt like sometimes guacamole does.  The chips were warm, crisp and fresh and they gave us more than enough. We decided to order 3 kinds of tacos to share - the Korean, Carnitas and Mushroom.  The Korean tacos were BY FAR the best.  The levels of flavor and the texture was absolutely perfect.  I honestly could have eaten 3 of those and been perfectly satisfied.  Mushroom tacos were my second favorite - really really good flavor for being vegetarian and had a good texture.  Carnitas fell short for me - they tasted how I expected but were a little too mushy for my liking.  I would try the fish tacos next time and I know Bobby will want the Chorizo.  As others mentioned, it is SO dark in there. Almost too dark to even see your food (or take a picture of the beautiful presentation without having an obnoxious flash).  It was also pretty loud, which I expected.  It was also really cold in there...but I don't blame public establishments for temperature flaws because of how insane the weather always is on a day-to-day basis..I'm sure it's hard to keep up.  The window from the outside and inside to see in the kitchen in the front of the restaurant was really cool and we stopped to watch the masters at work for a few minutes before we left.  You can tell they really take pride in their culinary craft and it shows in both presentation and flavor.  I told Bobby I will be calling this week to make 12 more reservations in advance (one per month) to make sure we get a seat at Tako to enjoy their food again :)",

It appears to be a street taco stand, but it's actually a hipsterish bar with an over the top unnecessary DJ. We were not thrilled with the drinks.. We returned both the Neville island tea and the blood orange frozen concoction. Way too strong, as it should be for $10, but we weren't trying to get drunk without appeasing our taste buds at the same time. The food was pricey... You can get the same quality at a Mexican taco stand for $2.00... And it's much more authentic. You'll like this place if you like throwing away money for an interesting twist on classic Mexican cuisine. $16 for two shrimp tacos, or $75 for a board of 12. They are definitely making a killing here, but not from my wallet, I won't be returning.",

If you've never had goat cheese and bacon guacamole you need to. The namesake taco with octopus is great but so are the Al Pastor with pineapple along with the chorizo. We ordered 5 different tacos and all were awesome. The cocktail and margarita menu is also comprehensive and creative. If mixed drinks aren't your thing you can grab a can of Tecate.   There is a live DJ and that may be the only drawback because it is loud as hell. That aside the atmosphere is like nothing else in Pittsburgh.",

But again it's worth it.  I'm not a huge drinker, but I sampled my friends margarita and it was refreshing and crisp... Not a one that comes from a mix or a blender.  I would also advise that the ambiance, while very trendy and fun is incredibly loud. If you're looking for a place to have good conversation I would probably not choose Tako. Instead I would go to Tako, eat, and then go somewhere else to talk!! Whatever you do...put this spot on your bucket list...you'll be glad you did!",

Very difficult to get into and get a reservation. We called a week in advanced and still could not get a reservation. We showed up 20 minutes before they opened and got in line. Yes, there was a line. We got seats at the bar as soon as they opened and after sitting down, the restaurant was already full. Glad we got to try it and will go back eventually, but will probably try this restaurant groups other places first. I feel this place is good, but just a little overhyped.",

We had Rolliing Stones tickets so...that wouldn't work. So, I lined up at 4.30p and we ran to the bar. Snatched two seats and reviewed both the drink and food menu.   Started with Cervices. Ended with two mushroom tacos. Both were great. The tacos in particular were fantastic. They had a great mixed of flavors and textures that popped. I couldn't finish two so it worked well with our food share plan for the night:)   The cocktails were prepared by an amazing tender. Not only did she craft great drinks, she knew how to carry on conversation. The latter is as important to me as the art of making the drink. We each had four cocktails and enjoyed each immensely. This was over the course of 2.5/3 hours and we walked off some of the buzz heading to Heinz Field.   Cannot wait to go back and spend another 3 hours saddled at Tako's rail.",

Once you walk in you can see the kitchen staff working to make the great food. They also have a few sits attached to the building serving as a sort of chefs table section looking into the kitchen. The first thing we noticed was the music in the establishment was much to LOUD,Awful Loud. The reason why I gave a four star rating.... We sat a the bar and Molly quickly took charge of us, she recommend drinks and suggested some food items.I went with Molly's recommended drink \"Dusk till Dawn\" it was carefully crafted and delish. We then order Chips and salsa (3- hot, medium, mild) as well as guacamole from the build your guacamole menu. Appetizers were great. As for dinner we ordered the Carnitas ,(braised pork with gauc, fresh salsa verde, white onion, cilrantro, and chicharrones) and the Pollo Asado, (grilled chicken, avocado,white onion, queso fresco, crema, serrano, and cilrantro) both were great. I must take my hat off to the Carnitas, it was special my personal favorite and the best I have ever had. I will be back again on my next visit, maybe even twice.",

Tako is octopus in spanish (apparently) but it also is representative of a menu primarily made of tacos. Unique combinations of beef, chicken, octopus, crispy fish, and vegetables adorn warm taco shells. (2 Per order ranging from $12 - $16)   I had the baja fish tacos which were absolutely perfect. I was also told that the beef and \"tako\" tacos were fantastic.   I probably could have eaten three tacos except for the fact that we started with the guacamole and the queso dip. Both were phenomenal and I highly recommend.   Spicy cucumber marg was also great.",

My friend and I arrived a couple of minutes late but were greeted warmly. There was one high top for 2 available and it was ours!! I had a classic margarita and i was not disappointed. We ordered guacamole. There was a guac menu that you could add all kind of stuff but we chose the basic. Chips were amazing- fresh and crunchy but guac was spicier than I expected even after asking. Beyond that.... amazing Korean tacos- tender steak and lots of veggies and spices.. yummy . My friend had the salmon tacos and cleaned her plate..mmmm good!!! We actually ordered dessert. Got tres leches. I'm not a fan but loved it with the fruit. I would recommend to anyone. Would be. 5 if the guac was just a little more traditional. Just my taste.",

We had to get the last one to go because we were so full!  We would recommend the Korean for a more interesting pick and the carnitas for something more traditional. Our waiter, Nick was great! He recommended the grapefruit margarita which I loved and would definitely get again! Our food was coming out a little slower than other people's (but honestly it was fine and we were enjoying the ambiance). Nick was very apologetic and checked on it which was unnecessary but very nice. My husband and I are pretty picky and have a handful of favorites, but this will be in the rotation!",

The first thing our waiter said once we sat down was \"our kitchen closes in 20 mins just so ya know\" so immediately we felt rushed which was unfortunate. The tacos were good but basically just street tacos nothing overly impressive. Drinks were good and the cheese dip we got as an appetizer was yummy too!  The atmosphere was very cool also.

I love my modern tacos with a fusion of flavors, as well as traditional (onions, cilantro and sauce) but I was pretty disappointed. I arrived on Sunday around 6pm and it was pretty busy. I couldn't sit at a table as it's by reservation only so I waited about 15 minutes for a bar seat to open up.   The service was good. I'll give it 4/5. The bartenders were friendly and even gave me some recommendations on what places to check out in Pittsburgh.   The food was way overpriced. I'll give that a 1.5/5.   The food itself I give it a 2/5. I was recommended to try the papas bravas by one of the bartender. The potatoes were cooked well. They were crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside. But the orange sauce drizzles on top was way too salty for my taste (and I like salt). I then ordered the Korean tacos. Although the flavors were mostly there (again, a little on the salty side) I couldn't get over the grainy taste of the meat. I know this is likely due to the peanut sauce but you guys need to work on that. I love peanut sauce and this was just off. Maybe I had a bad batch. Either way: not my favorite.",

Fresh warm chips and fresh guacamole were a good start. Had to try the street corn plate which was rich. Don't try to conquer this bowl yourself.

    "text": "I've been wanting to come here for so long! Stopped by one night last year and was (not particularly nicely) told they were booked for the next few days, so I finally made a reservation and came with a few friends this weekend. To keep it short - we were disappointed. I'd heard raving reviews from many friends of mine, and was super excited to try it out, but it fell short on all accounts. To start, getting a reservation was a little difficult. There were so few times available to book that we had to settle on a 3:30 pm time. We wanted to go for dinner but couldn't find reasonable reservation times before around 8-10pm, so we settled on a Sunday afternoon.   Atmosphere and service 2/5: When we got to the restaurant, it was surprisingly pretty empty, probably because of the awkward time. We were seated upstairs in a booth, which was a bit squishy for 6 people but not too terrible. It was really dark inside, not to my personal preference, but pretty standard for restaurants like this. The decorations were unique and interesting, but it's hard to notice much when it's so dark. The first plates we were given were dirty, and there was a large piece of food on one of our plates, but quickly switched out when asked. We were given only three hand towels for 6 people? We also had to ask to get our water replaced because nobody came by to check. Our personal server was polite and friendly, but other servers we interacted with were less amiable. Overall not the most pleasant experience I've had.  Food: 3.5/5 Looking over the menu, things seemed pretty pricy, so I had high expectations going in. Some of the dishes seemed pretty unreasonably priced, and I noticed that their prices seemed to have increased considerably looking at many of the yelp reviews I read. We ended up getting the ceviche and wings to share as starters. The wings were pretty unique, served with pickled carrots and cucumber and other greens, but with a really strong fish sauce smell and flavor that some people in my party really didn't like. They were rather sweet and a little spicy, and the sauce was tasty, but the meat was dry. The ceviche was not very interesting, and the chunks of fish were small and overshadowed by the volume and flavor of the vegetables. The chips it came with were good though.  Moving on to the tacos, we got a big board to share among the table. I tried the Korean taco, the Al pastor, and the duck taco. My favorite was probably the Korean, although none of them blew my mind. The Korean taco was pretty spot on because of the vegetables, but the meat didn't really taste like bulgogi.  On the other hand, the Al pastor had a large mound of meat and just a few pieces of pineapple and cilantro on top. Overall, my friends and I agreed that the tacos were in general too salty. It seemed the flavors were all really powerful but didn't go well together and just mixed and clashed. In addition, they only serve flour tacos with a really strong flour smell, although they were soft. The tacos weren't bad per se, but for $7-8 per taco, we expected a lot more. We left feeling dissatisfied and disappointed.",

Overall, 5 on the service, 3.5 on the food and 3.5 on the price. Chips and salsa was $7 and you only get two tacos. Dinner and two drinks between my girlfriend and I was over $60 without tip.

It was a gorgeous day and they have heat lamps above the counter!  Our server was incredibly witty and personable and not in an annoying way. In an awesome way.  The experience of sitting outside while also watching the chefs do their thing is definitely 5 stars. The turquoise glassware our water was served in was so unique. And the MUSIC ahhhhh amazing. It was faint, but I definitely heard some of The Weeknd and Wiz.   My favorite cocktails always seem to center around cucumber... so I was really excited to try the Spicy Cucumber margarita ($10). It did not disappoint. The exact right combination of Espolon tequila, cucumber, lime, and Serrano....  I can almost still taste it.... seriously, so good.   We started with the build your own guac... what! Awesome. There are lots of add ons to select from (we opted for pineapple, goat cheese, and smoked salmon) and the portion was generous.   We split the Baja tacos ($12) and the special beef barbacoa tacos ($13) (spicy cabbage, sesame seed salsa, avocado). The tacos themselves only get a 3.5 or 4. They were good, not great... and for the price I was hoping for great.  I also prefer grilled fish tacos instead of fried... but the beef was flavorful and tender.   But the tortillas definitely get a 5. I'm part Mexican and these are the first tortillas outside of my family that I have loved.   I can't speak to what it's like inside... but the outside experience was a blast. And I will definitely go back!",

There's not much seating inside and the lighting is very dim. The service was not great, as we received two dirty plates that we had to exchange and only 3 hot towels for all six of us. We ordered a ceviche for starters, which was $12 and contained a single slide of avocado with a few pieces of fish. It tasted alright, but wasn't anything special. We also ordered wings, which were more reasonably priced and tasted pretty good. For tacos, we ordered the big board, which contains 6 orders of tacos (so 12 total) for $78. I had one of the pollo asada and one of the chorizo taco. The chorizo one was a good balance of sweet and spicy and the yolk in the fried egg was silky. Overall the flavor and texture was pretty good. The chicken taco was alright but very average. My friends really liked the Korean taco. Our biggest critique was how overly priced nearly everything on the menu was and our experience was quite disappointing given our high expectations going in.",

We were told the earliest available table would be at 10:15, but got a text about ten minutes later and we're seated immediately. I would definitely suggest trying to make a reservation in advance. The ambiance of the place is great, the bar is beautiful as is the mural that the restaurant has become famous for. I started with a classic margarita, which I highly recommend, it was quite good. Also good are the watermelon margaritas. We then got classic guacamole and a poke bowl for the table. The guacamole was only ok, I found it to be overpriced for the amount that you are getting and overall lacking in taste. The poke bowl, however, was amazing and is a must try. I got the chorizo tacos while others at my table got the pollo asada, Korean short rib, and lamb tacos. The short rib tacos were good, solid 7/10 and the pollo asada were a solid 8/10. The chorizo tacos really stood out, the meat was delicious and the fried egg really made it worth it and even more so delicious, a 9/10. However, the lamb tacos stole the show. The meat was perfect and the cucumber with mint sauce just made the Taco unforgettable. The lamb tacos are a MUST TRY. We ended the meal with a tres leches cake, which I honestly found forgettable compared to the tacos themselves. I give this place a definite 5/5, it truly lives up to the hype. Pictured are the chorizo tacos and classic margarita.",

This place is ur strictly date night and or drink meet up spot. Not suitable for families. However once u get past how small the inside is, the menu has plenty of options ranging from guacamole to ceviche to every taco on the planet. We ordered margaritas (very small for the price but will get u tipsy), my hubby ordered the steak tacos and I got the chicken. Both were BANGING!!! We also ordered the guacamole and it was phenomenal!!! They use white onions in theirs instead of the normal red onion, which gave a great taste to the dip. For two ppl it was not badly priced for a dinner however when u think about the fact that it's just tacos, drinks and dip, u may think twice about eating here regularly. Just wish the place was bigger and the prices need to be adjusted but all in all we had a good experience.",

We also had this super awesome cheesecake dessert that was an amazing light whipped cheesecake with berries and berry drizzle. Delicious. For the drinks, you also can't go too wrong with any of them - the grapefruit sage is solid and packs a pretty strong tipsy punch. They also have an frozen eggnog cocktail that's worth a try!",

We always get the small plate of wings to start as they are usually delicious but this time they were too spicy to enjoy or even finish, very disappointing. We then learned that Tako has changed executive chefs and that many items have changed on the menu. You can no longer select from the 5 chef made guacamole and they removed some of the best tacos (duck and chorizo) but raised the price of the board. I hope the new executive chef takes some tips from his predecessor and then we may return.",

If you have room after the main course, the tres leches is awesome and is definitely worth a try.       For those who are of legal drinking age, the sangrias and margaritas are the bomb! Service is always good and they usually have a DJ playing music which is fabulous. It's a bit dark in the restaurant and the music is loud, but it sets almost a club-like atmosphere I personally do not mind.      We always make a reservation about two or so months in advance.

    "text": "Food was good (not amazing, but really good), atmosphere is interesting, staff was...not entirely friendly, but not entirely unpleasant.  For Pittsburgh, this probably is the best taco you're going to find - give it a shot!  Location is convenient, though it is also very small, so finding a spot to sit can be challenging.  There were a few tables outside (filled) when I was there, but I would never sit there as you'd have to suck down the cigarette smoke spewing from every 3rd Pittsburgher's mouth.  Foot traffic literally walks between the restaurant and the tables.  I ordered the fish tacos, which were decent.  They have a lot going on and might be better to just focus on a few quality ingredients than seeing how many you can fit into one taco.  (Also, they omit from the menu some of the items on the tacos, so radish lovers rejoice and radish haters beware!)  I saw them making some of the other tacos while I waited and would probably order something different if I go back.  You're probably hard-pressed to find something similar in PIT, so go for it!  It's decent and the prices weren't too bad.    One bone to pick:  tacos come in orders of two, but they force you to order two of the same taco.  You should let people mix-and-match (and just charge the higher of the two prices).  That way if I get a taco I'm not thrilled about (like the fish taco), I don't have to eat two of them (I actually didn't finish my 2nd taco and was \"over it\" as I neared the end of the 2nd) and could try something else (that I might be more thrilled about and come back later for more).",

I personally love the sidewalk seating for the warmer months.   The margaritas are some of the best I've had. The grapefruit and sage, the hibiscus and the absinthe and anejo are a few of my favorites. The queso fondido and guacamole are perfect starters and you truly can't go wrong with any of the taco options. What you wouldn't expect is that the poke appetizer is absolutely amazing. I've often just ordered this as my meal. The tuna is so fresh and works perfectly with the rice chips. You must order this if you haven't had it yet!  Service is always consistently friendly and accommodating. Overall, this is one of my favorite places in the city. Richard DeShantz and team can do no wrong! Keep up the great work!",

The cucumber margarita was unfortunately not as spicy as I had expected. The second time I tried the octopus (tako) taco and lychee and pepper margarita and it changed my life... Mind blown! The margarita was amazing, not too spicy with this awesome smokey taste. The tako taco was perfection in taste. Will definitely be back for this amazing combination.",

We have add a few different types of \"takos\" all of them have been fresh and full of flavor.  The atmosphere and decor is really hip and cool.

That being said, the queso with chorizo, and the guacamole with crab and corn were both delicious appetizers. The tacos we ordered were fine (a daily special with barbacoa, the Tako taco with octopus, and the chorizo taco with a fried egg on top). The drinks were good. The chocolate dessert was pretty terrible -- dry puff pastry with ganache, garnished with the smallest dollop of chocolate ice cream. The service was a tad hit or miss -- our waitress disappeared for long periods of time, but the only downside was for the restaurant --  I would have ordered another margarita. Would I return? We won't rush back. But we'll probably come back at some point simply because there are not enough good Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh, and this one is certainly pretty good. Next time, we'll sit in the bar area which seems to have much more light.",

The bar was so packed we couldn't even get a seat at 11:30pm. We asked the hostess for a table, and although multiple tables were open, she said they were reserved (we stayed for 20 mins, no one ever sat in those tables). We asked her if we could sit outside, but she said no because of our drinks. Bottom line: the place is packed, sub-standard and overpriced. I would not go back.",

This place is one of the reasons Pittsburgh's food scene is making a name for itself all across the world. Originality executed perfectly. May we suggest that you start with the Street Corn and the Papa Bravas? Although, I think my wife hit on a great idea to order the Street Corn as a side to be served with her tacos. Their take on a Long Island (the Neville Island Tea) was unlike any other and worth it. My wife had a drink special, the Basil Watermelon Margarita, which should be promoted to regular menu status.  The tacos...my wife ordered the Duck Confit tacos and I ordered the Korean tacos. First, the duck...the duck was perfectly cooked and moist. Think about the best Peking duck you've ever had, pre-constructed for you, and laid out on a wooden slab.   The Korean tacos were pretty much this: take authentic Korean BBQ short ribs, add all your favorite Korean side dishes, and wrap it up on the pancake you'd get with an order of Mushu Pork, and you've got the Korean tacos at Tako. Your taste buds and your stomach will thank you.   On top of that, the staff were friendly and were always around. You didn't have to wait excessively long for someone to come back and check on you.   Definitely going back!",

However, it does make for a full experience! The decor and atmosphere is definitely fun and unique. The food... amazing! Definitely get the guacamole and chips to start. We ordered pineapple in ours, and our waiter told us that they vacuum seal the pineapples whole before cutting it, and soak it with vanilla and simple syrup. It seriously tastes like candy and melts in your mouth! I got the carnitas tacos for my main course, and they were delicious. Although the tacos are not huge, don't let them fool you. Mine were super super filling, and had a bit of a spicy kick to them. They were perfect! The actual taco shell itself is perfect, too. I could watch them being made from scratch from my seat. I did not order any drinks, but they all looked amazing. I would definitely recommend getting a reservation here, if you can!",
