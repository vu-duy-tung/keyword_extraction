    "text": "We've been here many times before. I used to consider it my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. We haven't been there for over a year and, well, this place has nose-dived since then.  Before I talk about anything else about our experience, I want to say that we didn't see one smile there all night. Not a single one.  We went in at 8PM on a Saturday night. From the moment we went in, we had to wait. We waited probably 7 minutes before we even saw the Hostess. As soon as she saw us, she told us we'd have to wait at least 15 minutes. We sat down at the bar. And waited. Finally the sushi chef offered to get us some beers. We had to wait for those, too. Once we got the beers, mine was all funky. It had gotten warm and had been put back in the cooler. Gross.  We ended up waiting about 20 minutes to be seated. They sat us down underneath the stage while a band was warming up. After some waiting, the server brought us some cold bread and we asked if we could go sit in the corner away from the band. She obliged.  We waited. Finally we got our drinks. After we finished them, we had to actually go to the bar and ask for refills because the server was just nowhere to be found. Maybe she was busy in the back trying to do her sidework or something...I don't know. She only had four tables, I don't know why she was missing half the night.  The food was good. Their prices have gone up since we had been there. They have this three item combo where you pick like a steak, some seafood, some chicken, etc...and you get mashed potatoes and veggies. It used to be $19, now its $24. We got the lobster tail, the prime rib and coconut shrimp. It was all good. We also got this seafood platter that had shrimp scampi, beer batter cod, scallops and a baked potato for like $17. Everything was good. But the fact that we just had to wait and wait and wait made it all kind of crappy.  I guess they recently added some teppenyaki (or Hibachi as you yinzers like to call is) tables and stuff. They have sushi also but the sushi chef was making the sushi in the bar area. We sat and watched him make about six rolls and he didn't wash his hands once.   The only real consolation was that she only charged us for one vodka soda and I had about five. Plus the two beers and ice tea.  Oh...and the band was awful. They were called Run 4 Cover and....you bet we did as soon as we could get out of there.",

    "text": "I really hope the owner reads these reviews.  Because my husband and I used to enjoy the Baltimore House--but after our last meal there, we won't be back for a while.  The Baltimore House is one of the few places left in the Greater Pittsburgh area that serves stuffed flounder, which my husband loves.  The first three times he had it, he said it was perfect.  Heck, kitschy decor and oddball waitresses aside, for years we had great food every time, until our last visit.  The appetizer was burned.  Okay, so we'll say something, but our dinners are always great.  We would have said something, if given the chance!  There weren't that many people in the restaurant, but one would have thought they were packed to the gills; we didn't see our waitress for another 20 minutes, when she brought our entrees, then rushed off to the kitchen again.  Then we started eating our dinners, which both tasted like they had been liberally doused with salt.  Practically inedible.  Then a family of about 15 people came in, and the waitress busied herself with them during the rest of our visit.  We had trouble just getting the bill, let alone having a chance to complain.  We decided to pay it, leave, and stay away from Baltimore House for a bit.  We may go back in a few months to see if things have changed, because the food used to be really great.  But I really hope someone who matters sees these reviews, because it's sad that they're probably losing a couple of long-time customers.",

    "text": "Let me preface this review by saying that I have never been enthusiastic about The Baltimore House. I can recall seeing their commercials on local TV for years and wanting very much to try them, if for no other reason than that they were a seafood restaurant that wasn't Red Lobster. Although, after about 5 mediocre-to-bad visits over the course of as many years prior to my Yelp tenure, I finally gave up on them. The reviews I read on Yelp in the years since my last experience with Baltimore House only affirmed my boycott.   That was until Kay had a hankering for mussels, again. Why not give BH another chance?   And BH does them pretty well if our meal was any proof. The mussels were as tender, juicy, and buttery as they should be with some chopped garlic added to pump up the flavor quotient.   I couldn't decide on what to order for myself, so I went with their Seafood Norfolk, which features everything I pine for when I errr...sea-dine; lobster, scallops, crabmeat, and shrimp were all unimaginatively thrown together and sauteed in a butter sauce.   Was it good? Well, yeah. To be truthful, I was starving, and the aforementioned ingredients are difficult to botch. However, combine that with a lifeless baked potato, burnt croutons, and a decent but obviously pre-fabricated Oreo mousse dessert, and I cannot give BH anything more or less than a 3.   Kay ordered the extravagant Admiral's Seafood Platter, a smorgasbord that includes a lobster tail, scallops, shrimp, oyster shells stuffed with their Crabmeat Imperial, and filet mignon, all prepared yet again with BH's magic component, butter. She did let me taste the filet mignon, and through that morsel, I learned in splendid fashion that medium-rare is always the way to go when ordering steak. This was ideally cooked beef.    Our server did a fine job and was a nice kid, so I have no gripes on that end.  The interiors of The Baltimore House are eccentric and vast. You never know which room you'll be seated in. There's the room with the kitschy pirate statues, a few others I cannot recall, and then the faux nightclub.   Guess where they put us.   My back was turned for the duration of our meal, but based on the strident, pounding 80's dance music, multicolored lights, and odd barks and hoots that assailed my senses, I thought a wild party was afoot somewhere in the house.   When I turned around, I only saw a handful of middle-aged suburbanites at the bar.   Before we left, our waiter revealed that there were some \"serious\" drink specials that night, particularly on Jager bombs.   Call the babysitter. Ask her to stay a little later. Woo. Hoo.   The Baltimore House is an oddity that fails to be extraordinarily good but is in no way egregiously bad. If they were a little less pricey, I'd recommend them as a go-to for those times when one is desperate for seafood, but being that they're in the \"Spendy\" range, I'd advise area diners to stay away like most of the other reviewers on Yelp have.   P.S. BH also houses a restaurant-within-a-restaurant called Kazoku that specializes in Japanese fare, including teppanyaki and sushi, but they were closed when we were there Friday evening.   P.P.S. I should have taken a picture of the opulently wacky enclosed waterfall display outside. Clark Griswald would be impressed.",

    "text": "My husband and I had been here before years ago - was decent then - but not so much now - we went on a Saturday night expecting it to be busy but it wasn't, and I should have read some reviews before going!  Shame on me.    It took over 10 minutes to get greeted and drinks ordered which took another 10 to arrive.   Our salad came 15 minutes after she brought the drinks and bread - the entrees took over an hour, and she forgot my Lobster Bisque (which she brought only after I asked about it - had one piece of lobster in it but mostly broth and potatoes).     My husband got the wrong salad and ranch dressing when he asked twice for Italian dressing.   The fish was ok, but not as described in the menu.  She gave my sides to him and his to me - thank God we're married and can share plates.    She gave him mashed potatoes when he ordered a baked potato.   Then when we pointed that out, she said \"oh let me go get you one\" but then came back over 10 minutes later saying that the cook told her they were out of baked potatoes and he substituted the mashed (no one asked us!)   She asked if he wanted something different and he said 'No thanks i'll eat these\" but when I asked him why he didn't get a vegetable or fries he just looked at me and said \"Why so she can bring me squid as a substitute?\"    The mashed sweet potatoes taste like Gerber baby food potatoes (not kidding - I'd avoid these altogether).   Our waitress had a very stoic  \"I could care less\" attitude while waiting on us and everything took way too long to arrive.   No manager checked on us and the waitress never checked on us to see if our food was ok.  The bathroom door does not close nor lock and the staff were seen complaining (using the F-bomb) right by customers at the bar - about their hours and wanting to go home and about not liking the long shift they were working.     You can tell the place is not managed properly (I used to work in food service years ago so I know) and the staff really don't like being there.      I would not return, not even with a coupon.      My husband could not wait to get out of there.",

The lobster was perfectly cooked and the shrimp and scallops were tasty.  The others in the group ordered prime rib (which they both said was very good), crab legs (a lot of crab legs) and another seafood platter (very good).  The service was a bit slow (we refilled our own water glasses).  The place is huge and very complicated to navigate. I have passed this place 1000's of times but this was the first time I tried it.

    "text": "Long story short: We were there waiting for almost 3 hours for our food. There were maybe 6 other patrons in the establishment. Sushi chef was a no-show and they were out of items we wanted to order (it took them 2 hours to realize they had no gyoza!) What kills me here is that the place was NOT busy at all. Not once did the waiter offer to refill our water. I wish they'd had just said they couldn't serve us.  In detail: (I'd been here before for sushi and the only issue before was waiting to be seated...which took 10-15 minutes) We (a party of 4) arrived at 4:30 for the 1/2 off sushi and we waited a while to be seated. We were only seated when we walked into the bar portion and told someone we were there. The waiter alerted us that the sushi chef was late and that there might be a little bit of a wait and that they'd extend the 1/2 off sushi discount for us as a result. We figured maybe they were stuck in traffic or something, it happens, but they'd eventually show up soon. We sat around for a while waiting to order some drinks and appetizers. The frozen drinks couldn't be done because their machine wasn't working. They had no edamame at all. We ordered tuna tar-tar, spicy shrimp, gyoza, miso soup, 8 sushi rolls and our drinks. I believe it was about 5-5:15pm (30 to 45 hour later) before the miso soup came out. The tuna tar-tar and spicy shrimp appetizer came out about 15 minutes later. We asked about the gyoza and the waiter said that there had been an issue since the gyoza wasn't on the menu properly (or something similar...which made no sense to us) and that he'd get the order put in again. I understand that since the sushi chef hadn't shown up yet, that some things couldn't be made yet ...but we finally started receiving the sushi rolls at around 6:15pm (almost 2 hours from the time we arrived/ordered). We got the sushi rolls NOT because the sushi chef arrived, but because 2 guys were making it themselves (we didn't realize this until we were paying our bills, the sushi chef was a no-show all night). The guys did a decent job at making the sushi, so I'm sure they had some training. They brought everyone's order out plopped on plates at random and the waiter didn't know which roll was which and he had to ask the guys who made the sushi about what was what...and they didn't seem to even quite know. The sushi rolls were good, but not quite what was described on the menu. Some had a type of fish or vegetable substituted for something else or just mixed around. We're frustrated and at this point not going to argue about what the sushi is supposed to be. We want to eat and leave. At 6:30 we finally had our last sushi roll delivered to the table. We asked about the gyoza again and the waiter came back and said they had none. 2 hours...and they finally figured out that they had NONE. This was kind of the last straw with the place. Due to the wait and everything, the waiter said the manager was willing to give us all each 1 drink free. Most of us didn't order another and opted to have our current one free. When we got our checks, the drinks hadn't been removed and the waiter had to go back and adjust the check which took a while. We finally got out of there around 7:15. Not all of this was the sushi chef's fault for not showing, not all was the waiter's fault...Everything just had something wrong or missing from the service, to the food, to the missing food. We won't be going back. I've never had to wait almost 3 hours or had as many issues as we did. Big shame because we live so close to Kazoku.",

    "text": "Driving past this place for many years, my family was always scared away by the tacky exterior complete with busty pirate wench. When we finally decided to stop in, we were quite surprised to find what is a very vast and extravagant interior. Sure, there's still some tacky inside, but you could spend hours just walking through exploring the curious objects like it was some strange museum.   The prices for both the fish and the alcohol are extremely reasonable; much lower than you'll find for comparable meals in the area. The fish also met with my father's very exacting standards (he is never one to miss when someone uses \"K\"rab meat, \"nearly fresh\" fish, or just the wrong type of fish altogether).   The interior space, prices, and location near Jefferson Memorial Park also made this the perfect place when we needed a restaurant for a post-funeral lunch. Their menu options were very traditional and perfect for our needs, and as a group I believe we finished every last item served on the buffet. With the reasonable drink prices, it was also very easy to make it a cash bar without anyone feeling put out.   At this point we've eaten there maybe a half dozen times - any time my family comes to town we usually take a trip over. The individual experiences have been a bit of a mixed bag, with the worst being a Friday night we went and were seated upstairs near a band that was warming up the entire meal. I and my mother enjoyed the crab cakes, not the ambiance, though my father was very disappointed with his seafood pasta meal as being almost devoid of fish and overly sauced. The waitresses have also been kindof mixed, some being very nice while others have been downright weird.  Our best meals there have generally been during the week, or for lunch, where they seat us downstairs off the bar area. I will probably avoid dinner hour on the weekends going forward, since it's those times that didn't go as well.  Despite a couple of mediocre experiences, I still like this place and have never personally had a bad meal food-wise. It's one of the few non-chain restaurants in the Century III area, and honestly the interior just fascinates me every time.",

So for a special occasion we took our family there, I called ahead to make sure they still did the AYCE on Sunday and asked if we needed reservations which I figured we didn't but wanted to make sure. She said they had AYCE and no reservations needed it was available 5-9 as usual. We got there around 6:30 and they were completely out of crab legs. We drove over 20 minutes for a complete disappointment. But we still went in and ordered off of the menu. It was not as good as it had been in the past the food was cold and bland. I got scallops and they were so fishy that I couldn't eat them. I eat a lot of seafood and understand the difference between a normal seafood taste and old fishy food and it was the latter. One of the only times ever that I have been starving and literally couldn't choke my food down. But I had my fries left at least, So when I asked for ketchup they brought out a squeeze bottle and took one bite and realized it was cocktail sauce that I had put on mine and my daughters food. Completely ruined her meal and when I said something they didn't believe that it was cocktail sauce!  The whole staff didn't care from the point we walked in until we left. Very disappointing since we used to love it here. I'm not sure if we will ever go back.",

The poor wait staff was severely over worked with the amount of customers in the building, although they were pleasant & doing a good job with our table of nine people. The food horrible. Was embarrassed to have recommended my entire family to eat here. And to have paid the amount we did for the food we got was really upsetting. Will NEVER return!",

My steak was ordered rare and it came out cold. The salad itself came in a taco bowl, which I hate. Hubs didn't have any huge complains but all his food was drenched in butter.  The couple that were seated behind us had ordered almost the same meal and they sent all their food back.  We were one of 3 tables in the entire restaurant and we were sitting next to each other.   We were sitting in the non smoking section and everytime the waiter came back he smelled worse and worse like an ashtray, and I'm not normally that picky about cigarette smell.  The tacky decorations were the best thing about this place bc at least we could pose and laugh. But we will not be going back here.",

And while eating at this place is an experience in itself, the food is just eh.  It's you're typical bland seafood fare.  They have pretty decent wedding soup, I'll give them that.  But it's just very boring baked seafood in butter, with no seasoning.  The menu is enormous though and I've hardly begun to sample it, so maybe you'll have better luck.  It certainly wasn't bad, it was just kinda so-so.  The problem was, the bill just mounted up very quickly and I spent more than I would have expected, especially given the quality of the food.  Will I return?  I don't know.  It's a fun place to take visitors to the area because it's such an interesting spot, but I'm still kind of on the fence with the food.",

It took about 10 more minutes after the coke just to get a menu.  strike 3....Another 10 minutes goes by, finally waiter comes by after I flag him down and I decided to order 2 appetizers the Lobster Bisque arrives 15 min after ordering it,... It also arrived at room temp, and I also ordered the buffalo shrimp, it came about 10 or 15 minutes after the soup,it was ok, but you sure don't get many, I think I counted 9 small shrimp both apps were ordered at the same time, talk about slow  strike 4....another 15 minutes until I see my waiter, I decided on the Alfredo added shrimp to the pasta for an up charge   Strike 5 ...about 30 minutes later I get the entree it's horrible the shrimp tasted like they were frozen and quickly thawed in water then added to the less than satisfactory Alfredo   Strike 6... I have to ask for my check as waiter was passing...as I about had it with this place, it wasn't even worth my time to complain as it was obvious management didn't care about how the bussiness was run, I mean no one ever visit it my table or the table next to me. That table was less also less than impressed. I'm sure it's their last visit also.  Conclusion don't let the name of this place get you in the door, trust me you will be very disappointed. Save your money and go just about anywhere else in the country before going to the Baltimore House in Pleasant Hills",

The appetizer took about 25 minutes to arrive, I had 2 oysters which were oddly hard as if they had been left out for an extended period of time. My girlfriend had ordered a 10 oz steak (medium rare) which came out absolutely charred on the outside and raw inside. It was farrr too burned for me to even say \"oh it was seared\". It was burned to the point where it was breaking apart on the outside and was cold inside. I had ordered the fish, which was soaking wet, and undercooked to where any seasoning on it just smeared off. Dinner took over an hour to come and the staff was very apologetic over it. The bill came to about $70, and I couldn't logically blame any of these issues on our server so we still tipped her @20%. We will never go back.",

    "text": "This place ranks among the absolute WORST OF THE WORST! Here is a list of a few lowlights of the evening:  1) Bewildering wacky, maze-like, dismal, neglected interior, with a crazy mish-mash of pirate, Asian, and pub-themed decorative items (that all look to have a permanent film of grease).  2) Insane combination of both impossibly dim lighting in some spots and almost painfully glaring chandeliers in others (probably for the best so that we could not really see the unholy awful food that was about to be served to us).  3) Overflowing, plugged-up bathroom sink with no paper towels (at least there was toilet paper in the stall)  4) Waitress at neighboring table (three feet away) TWICE dropped ramekins of melted butter all over table and floor (our waitress, however, was friendly, prompt, and competent at least).  5) Some sort of rock band was setting up in the adjoining bar area and had to troop back and forth through dining area, repeatedly, with all of their equipment and instruments to set up on stage...this went on for about a half hour and was very disruptive.  6) Most importantly, the food was HORRID! My husband's lobster bisque was a salty, gloppy mess which may have had some lobster flavoring added to it somewhere in there, along with the puzzling presence of potatoes. Steamed clams were ok..not great but not terrible...were overcooked though. Prime rib was inedible. Leathery, thin, super-fatty, cold, and other than the taste of old beef tallow, had no flavor...like it had been sitting in a warmer for the last four or five days. I ate a few bites because I was starving and we were still an hour and a half away from home, but it was so vile that I just left three-quarters of it on the plate. Didn't bother sending it back because by then, it was evident that any replacement would have been no better. My husband got an abomination of a broiled seafood medley that was rubbery and tasted of nothing but oily melted margarine and garlic powder.   Been to many a restaurant in my 50 years, and usually am at least moderately satisfied. This place, however, was among the worst I have ever had the misfortune to experience. It looks like it used to be a good place, maybe like 25 years ago, and perhaps some family member inherited it a while back who know little of decent food and restaurant management, and is now just barely hanging on. Ultimately, my advice: AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!",

We arrived at 5:20pm and actually thought the place was closed at first, not a soul was there.  A waitress told us to \"sit anywhere\"  and brought us drinks and menus and then 20 minutes later had us move from our empty table to another empty table where we sat, ignored for another 25 minutes.  We think they were waiting to try to \"fill up\" the table, but no one came out and said anything to us like \"We'd like to wait xx long to see if anyone else comes.\"  So, just after 6 another couple came in and was seated with us.  After they decided and placed their order, the hibachi chef confirmed our order and said that he'd \"See about starting soon\".  Our soup arrived a full hour after we'd first sat down.  The soup was good, the salad was veggies that had clearly been in the fridge cut up too long (dried out carrots, wilted greens) swimming in their dressing. No forks were provided, so everyone ate salad with fingers/chopsticks.  Finally when the chef started cooking, he broke one of the eggs so it was unusable, and didn't add another, making 3 servings of fried rice with just one egg. I was supposed to have steamed rice, but the waitress brought the me sushi rice, then took it back and brought back the steamed rice.    The chef over cooked our rare beef, his knife was clearly not sharp enough because he had to really work to get through the veggies and our meat, we discovered, was not sliced through, and we had large chunks of meat, too big for bite-sized.  We waiting more than 15 minutes more after we were done for our check. They had cleared our plates so knew that we were done.  I had to go find a manager to get our checks and then there was a problem because they had apparently put it in all as one.  We had a PG deal coupon and the waitress repeatedly asked us what it was and where we got it.  After I complained to the manager, she gave us 1/2 off one of our meals, making it just over $40 for the entire bill, so thank goodness we had the PG Deal because that was definitely way too much for the okay food and horrible, horrible service.   They offered us the balance of the deal on a gift card and we refused, we will NEVER go back there again. The total time we were there was 2 1/2 hours and we saw our waitress a total of 4 times, before I went looking for the manager.",

    "text": "A group of friends and I tried this place for the first time, being drawn in by the promises of 1lb of crab legs for $10.  3 of us ordered our crab while the other 2 ordered steak.    Long story short: the crab legs were amazing, I felt bad for the two that ordered steak.    Looking at the steak, it had a not-so-right gray color to it, first red flag, then you notice that half of it is mostly fat.  For $20, I would want the large steak that it is supposed to be...not have to cut away half of the inedible portion of it.  I didn't want to taste test it for myself, so I'll take my friends' word for it that it tasted as terrible as it looked.  One of the unlucky receivers of steak called over a manager.  Her excuse was that \"the cut of meat is supposed to be fatty\" to which my friend replied, \"I could get a better cut of meat at a chain restaurant\" (zingggg).  The manager comped him the price of the steak so all was well.  Our waitress and the whole ambiance of the place was...a little weird. The place was completely empty for being dinner time on a Saturday night before Christmas.  Previous posters have explained the weirdness of the place and the waitresses so I don't have to go any further.  Based on that, and the quality of my crab legs I have to give this place 4 out of 5 - I would definitely return..but ONLY for crab legs, I'm not sure that I would trust anything else on the menu.  But if you were to ask those in my group who got the steak, they'd give it a 0 if they could.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I were in the neighborhood to see a movie, and we wanted to find a place that could accommodate both salmon for me and steak for her. When we saw the Baltimore House while driving, it looked like the perfect spot, so we excitedly parked and went in. When you walk in you are greeted with a mostly empty fish cooler, one can only assume that at the height of this establishment's popularity the cooler was filled with fresh fish, but now sat sadly barren. I say it was mostly empty because it still held a few pieces of fake greenery with plastic fish on top, as a decoration that I appreciated. The lighting was a combination of bright neon and nothing else, which created an ambiance very similar to a strip club, making the massive but unfortunately mostly empty dining room feel like an undiscovered cavern adorned with various seafaring-related decorations. We were led through the cavern to a separate dining room that was a striking departure from the first. It was reminiscent of your grandparents house, but again, filled with sea-related decorations. I was hoping to get a simple salmon filet, so you would think I wouldn't have a problem with that at a seafood restaurant, but turns out there is no salmon at all at this seafood restaurant. Before we realized this, we ordered two iced teas that we didn't even take the straw wrappers off of, but we were still charged for the drinks when we told the waitress that we were leaving, $5 for two unsweetened iced teas. This place may have been the bees knees 15 years ago, but these days it's a hollow shell of what I assume it used to be.  EDIT: Bumped up to two stars from one because they have a kick-ass Bruce Lee statue outside",

I'm sorry, but that is FALSE ADVERTISING!!!  While the ingredients were fresh enough, whoever they have as their sushi chef is an amateur at best!  They were WAY off on the rice to fish ratio, and the rice was so hot, it actually started to cook the fish!  BTW, My wife enjoyed the Hibachi she had, and the Hibachi chef was very good.

I have lived in Pittsburgh for 6 years now and am a Long Island NY transplant, these crabs are the thing I missed most from home and they really did them right, and at only $2.99 a piece! If you like blue crabs seriously go check this place out, you will not be disappointed! The staff was very friendly, they had a high chair with working straps (not a given in the area), and everything was clean.

Food was on its way out. No bake potato like I had ordered, crab legs were so over seasoned with nasty spice, husband's crabcakes look like they had been sitting on the stove forever and after he bit into them he could not get the taste of nasty old stale crab out of his mouth. We got up and left! I have never, ever, ever done that before. We spend a lot of money on going out to eat. We tip well and don't have \"high expectations!\" This was the worst place in all of my years of going out to dinner. NASTY FOOD, no liquor in a BAR ON A FRIDAY, and waiter who could care less!

So much so that we drive all the way to Curry Hollow from Cranberry during rush hour and are willing to deal with server roulette.  I remember Baltimore house growing up, and it is definitely a shadow of its former self.  Between the terrible exterior decor, and the hybrid decision to have an american seafood joint and a hibachi joint and the lack of good (non smoking) talent, I would advise my family and friends to not eat anything on the menu that's not the crab legs simply because I can guarantee that the kitchen isn't turning it around fast enough to provide fresh ingredients, and they're not making enough money to waste on keeping fresh stock of anything not on the AYCE special.  It's also kind of dirty looking.  ...But the crab legs are simply to DIE for.  They freakin' nailed it.",

Last night we went and it was... strange.   This restaurant is huge.  There is a hibachi room and a sushi restaurant.  Given the quality of the food for hte love of god i implore you not to order their sushi.  It cant be anything but food poisoning on a plate!  We were seated in the \"old mans den room.\"  Our waitress walked by our table 3 times and then came over and said, \"Opps...I forgot to see you.\"  I asked what beers they had on tap and said said, \"no beer tonight.  tap system down.  no beer.\"  so i asked if they had bottles.  She said she was sure they had bottles but did not know what kind.  In fact, she basically denied beer existed, until another waitress came over and confirmed they had Sam Adams in bottles.  I order one.  \"We're out of that one.  I can just bring you what we have.\"  WTF?   Turns out, they had Labatts.  We ordered the crab leg appetizer, and when they brought us our bucket for the shells, there were bits of crab meat and smelly water in the bottom of the bucket.  Its obvious they dont wash those so if for some reason you maybe threw something you were going ot eat into your bucket...leave it.  that was pretty gross.  The crab legs were good.  They have this surf & turf thing where you can get different items and it was only $13.  Never order $13 surf & turf.  This is a life lesson.  I had more crab legs and steak.  The steak tasted freezer burned and was inedible.    My friend had shrimp and baby back ribs and liked them, but this guy will eat anything so i do not trust his judgement.  Half way through our meal the waitress came over, removed my half drunk Labatts and brandished a bottle of Sam Adams.  \"Ohh...I was wrongsies, we have Sam Adams now!\"  she said that.    It was so weird.  After she put it on the table she sat down on the floor and said, \"Whew, now I can breathe.\"  I think she's just a kook.  There were only three of us dining there.  It was so weird.  I'll be back, probably over a year from now, just for crab legs.  This place is weird but still seems kind of fun and it might be a fun place for cocktials.",

I'd give this a one star rating if my waiter was not doing the best he could, but he was pretty awesome considering the circumstances. It started with another server bringing dirty side plates while not even realizing they were dirty until after setting them down on the table. I received my mixed drink with flat ginger ale. It was replaced for a fresh drink, but I was charged for 2 drinks. We ordered a calamari appetizer which was a very small portion  and had basically no flavor. The menu is different as they no longer serve sushi or habachi.  I ordered the surf and turf and got the teriyaki chicken with a crab cake. The crab cake was HORRIBlE while the chicken was okay. They forgot half of my food, which the server was apologetic and offered to get out to me, but at that point I was just ready to go!

    "text": "Disappointed and soggy  Went to the Baltimore House because they are really the only place in Pittsburgh that has whole crabs. This place is on the decline. Not packed, just 4 tables sat in dining room, but took 20 min to just get my drink. The had advertisements everywhere for a new Black Rock cooking experience but it was not yet available in spite of the menus for it placed on the tables. The crabs were mushy and overcooked. The drinks were weak and watery. The service was not great as they gave me a real hard time with my Groupon. Then the roof started leaking, water pouring down, in the middle of the dining room.   It's never been a 5 star restaurant but I used to like this place. I really hope that the Black Rock cooking revitalizes this place if not I don't see them lasting much longer.",

    "text": "I got take out from the Baltimore House so I didn't get the complete horrid experience that some of the other reviews say. But for starters the outside of the building needs a major makeover. The creepy, outdated statues aren't not doing any favors for this place. There are still signs on the exterior that say sushi and hibachi bar and they haven't served either of these in over a year. The inside isn't bad though. I was actually surprised with the main level. It gave off the vibe of a nice steak & seafood restaurant. Main level is non smoking; downstairs smoking is allowed. It is a lot louder downstairs that upstairs. Like most of the reviews say, the place was pretty empty. I went a little after 5pm but for it being a weekend, you'd think there would be at least someone else in the building, but nope! Just 3 employees.   Now to get to the food...I can't say it was so horrible I had to eat food from another restaurant instead, but also not over-the-top amazing. I ordered the clam chowder to start. I'm not a huge clam chowder eater but it tasted pretty good to me. I don't have much to compare it to though, but I'd go back to get it again. I also got the lobster Mac and cheese. It was basically pasta mixed with lobster bits and then a cheese sauce on top of it. It tasted like something I could just throw together by myself, but it didn't taste bad. Just average and nothing I'd be eager to try again. Then for the main dish I got the lobster roll. When I first saw it, I was a bit surprised. It was about the size of my fist. I started questioning if I had accidentally ordered off the kids menu. It tasted good but if I had not ordered the app, I would definitely have been very hungry afterwards.",

    "text": "I was pretty weary of this place because of all the bad reviews, but I was willing to try it because it looked cool/interesting and I love seafood. This place was basically a meme. The inside is like a labyrinth. The lights and decorations make it seem like it's trying to be cool but ultimately it's just... strange. I got a pretty generic meal. Crab legs and fries. The fries came out scalding hot and the crab legs were cold. It was hard to break them and get any meat out either. There was a fry in my butter sauce when they gave me my plate. My friends got the hardshell crabs and they didn't have high expectations, but they said they were pretty bad. Overcooked and hard to get any meat out. It's a shame, we love crab. We've all had some really good crab at places in Maryland, but this place was a joke. It was doable and luckily didn't make us sick. But don't spend $60 on a dinner for 2 here, it tries to look semi-fancy but it's just flat out bad.",

I ordered a pound of crab legs and chicken fettuccine Alfredo. Crab legs were small but I think they gave more than a pound for that reason, and the Alfredo was delicious. My fiance had a pound of crabs legs as well, along with the prime rib that he devoured. Their butter is like liquid gold! All in all, food was good but the decor and cleanliness could use some work! I'll go back :)",

Lobster sandwich had hardly any lobster and they told me I was lucky to get that as they were out of it.  Why not tell me to order something else then.  Place looked dirty.  They sat us at a booth, then waitress told us they have a problem with bugs there.  They sat us by the kitchen door which kept slamming then we asked for a different table and the table was lopsided and rocking.  Another waitress told our waitress she was mean for making us move.  Service and food were terrible!",

    "text": "Well, its official, I've found my least favorite restaurant in the Pittsburgh area.    I came here on a Saturday night with my sister-in-law and getting inside was tricky.  There was some sort of benefit concert taking place so it was unclear where to enter.  Once we finally navigated that we were asked to sit in smoking or non-smoking.  We chose non, but let's just say that didn't stop the smoke from bellowing over to our table.  In fact, my hair and clothes reeked from the hour I sat there.   I can count on one hand the number of times I've sent a meal back to the kitchen and this recent experience at the Baltimore House can be counted in that category.  We both chose the Alaskan crab legs and both immediately returned them.  The little to no crab meat in the case was cold and rubbery.  The waitress was nice though and immediately grabbed them and asked if we wanted something else.  I got the crab cakes, which were 'meh' and my s-i-l just ordered mozzarella sticks that were also inedible.  So we didn't insult or further upset our waitress she wrapped them up and hid them so it looked like she ate them.    Service was spotty but our waitress was nice.  Another employee at one point walked by our tables and yelled out the F-word.  The 'bouncer' at the door near the ground floor entrance said he was only there for the event and had no idea if/when you could be seated.    Decor is very bizarre and includes a non-working Jacuzzi under the steps.  There appears to be a nautical/pirate theme but I also saw some other weird statues, such as a dog.  I wouldn't mind all that if the food wasn't so terrible.  Sorry, I'll never return.",

Each time I needed a refill on my drink I had to flag someone down. While I understand they were short staffed the restaurant was not that busy to warrant the lack of concern or service.

I had bought a groupon but never used before it expired, menu looked decent enough so decided to check it out.  I instantly fell in love with the building (I don't like chains and this place is definitely different, in a wonderful way.  So much character) We went for lunch, service was great.  Our waitress was quick on her toes and attentive, offering suggestions when asked.  When we first arrived we were the only table seated but it began to fill up and she never lost a beat. Food was more than expected.  Lobster bisque and clam chowder both wonderful.  Cesar  and house salad great too, (it's a salad, don't understand the complaints there).  Hot rolls offered and obviously fresh.   Seared scallops cooked to perfection.  I myself had the seafood lasagna, which was smaller than expected but after one bite I realized why... It's the real deal stuffed with seafood and speaks for itself, no reason to overcompensate. Followed up by a shared tiramisu.  The presentation was lovely.

The alfredo was completely tasteless. We never did get our coleslaw and we were charged for rice that we didn't order.
