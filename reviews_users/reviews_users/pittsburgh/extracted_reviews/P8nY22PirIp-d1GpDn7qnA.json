    "text": "Naw, these are NOT better than In-n-out by a far stretch. Having heard recently that these were tied as the best burgers in the nation, I was anxious to compare to San Diego's local In-N-Out Burgers. The decor is surprisingly similar to In-N-Out restaurants, diner style with red and white tiles.  Very friendly young staff that help you out if you've never been there with the menu that is totally a la carte. This is very surprising that there is not value meal deal available.Two burgers,one fries to split and two drinks were $20 bucks,not cheap However,there are plenty of peanuts everywhere you can dip into while waiting for your order. BURGERS: Buns are very ho hum, small and uneventful.They also provide the choice of excellent grilled onions and the meat is very good, looks to be homemade, very tasty and juicy burger. Cheese was oddly melted and messy but not in a really good way. FRIES were cooked in peanut oil and I thought rather oily,soggy and not appealing after awhile. I was sure hoping that Five Guys would come through for me but they really need to rethink their buns and fries to come anywhere close to excellent.",

It really makes a difference, and while the end result is a little spendy for fast food, it's definitely worth the price.  Plus, you can add any number of toppings (mushrooms, onions, etc.) at no extra cost.",

This is definitely not a place for anyone with a peanut allergy to go. As a vegetarian, I like that I can get a bun with enough veggies and cheese on it to be filling. That being said their sandwiches are extremely sloppy and their fries are quite oily, but very good. Both their regular fries and Cajun fries are good and they are very generous with their portions. If you are looking for fast food that is tasty, and fresh I recommend Five Guys.",

These are some seriously good burgers man. there was a sign on the window that said \"the best 5 bucks you can spend on a burger.\" i would have to agree. for starters, the meat patties are literally twice as big as the ones in n out, and they give you two. you can pick from tons of toppings... pickles, grilled onions, mushrooms (the ultimate), lettuce, tomatoes, ketchup, mustard, etc. i got the grilled onions, mushrooms, pickles, tomatoes, and lettuce, with some mustard. man that bad boy was FAT. it really was quite a good burger, i'd prefer it over any restaurant burger. the meat was defintely fresh and juicy, didn't taste frozen. the bun was nice and moist and chewy. the ingredients were fresh. wow. only 5 bucks. sure a whole in n out meal costs 5 bucks, but u wont get a burger like this on the west coast. i think theres one in cerritos though..  the fries... my friend loved. they taste like boardwalk fries. apparently theres cajun fries i ddn't get to try those, but these fries are better than in n out for most people. i think i got used to in n out fries so i like em anyway. but note to self, get cajun fries.  and oh. all you can eat peanuts if you want. what a nuttin good deal.",

    "text": "I know it's a chain and I try not to review chains, but damn are these burgers and fries good.  However, I'd heard other compare them to in n out on the left coast and I'd disagree because while they are quite good they do not compare to the first time I fell in love (in n out burger).  Okay, went here with Mom yesterday for lunch.  I was a bit surprised to find it relatively empty and no wait at all.   The cashier greeted us with a warm, genuine smile and even gave mom a compliment on her blouse.  She knew how to work the tip jar.  I ordered the \"little\" bacon cheeseburger and it was plenty big and really reasonable priced.  I had it with sauteed onions and mushrooms (no extra charge) and a bit of mayo.  Mom was more traditional with a \"little\" burger with L, T, O and ketchup and mustard.  We ordered one drink to share and a \"regular\" cajun fries.  The total cost was under $13 and we had plenty of fries left over.  The burger itself was really flavorful, juicy, and the bun was soft and warm.  The fries were some of the best I've ever had in any restaurant.  I think it's because they are fresh cut daily and double fried in peanut oil.  The restaurant only serves burgers and fries, so not to much to think about.  I don't really care that they don't serve milkshakes I think I did enough artery clogging with the bacon cheeseburger and fries.  Tessaros is still the best hands down, but if you are looking for a great quick burger and friendly service for Mickey D's prices.  This is the place to go.  I will become a regular.",

I've eaten at other Five Guys locations and the buns at this one just plain taste weird. I don't know why.  The tables are dirty. I don't like sitting down to a table smeared with someone else's cheeseburger-grease. This, plus the loud crappy music being blasted, means I'm not taking anyone here for a date, or on any kind of business lunch.  It's dumb that they serve all hamburgers in a brown paper bag. I know it's probably part of some silly tradition, but the bag means that the tables get messy because you have to rip open the bag and grease goes everywhere. Also, the fries and bun get soggy inside the bag.  Note: this does not happen on a McDonald's tray.  If the restaurant would change its dumb, backwards policy of serving all food in ghetto paper bags and the workers would wipe down the tables more than once a year, this place would be a five-star restaurant, easy.",

The burgers and fries were appetizing. I would have given a higher rating, but the soda and condiment station was kind of a mess and the customer service was lacking a little. I ordered a cheeseburger and the cashier asked \"what do you want on your cheeseburger?\" I responded with \"Uh, lettuce? tomatoes? Onions?\" In my head I was like, \"You know, the normal stuff you put on a cheeseburger.\" My mom responded in the same confused manner when asked what she wanted. It was obvious we weren't understanding the purpose of her question, but the cashier just looked at us awkwardly, smiled and asked if that was it for us. She looked like a young college student and maybe with a little more years of experience she would have been able to easily identify that we've never been to a Five Guys before (or were otherwise incompetent at ordering beef and spuds) and explained the way it worked a little bit. After we already ordered, I saw a sheet of paper on the counter with a checklist of things you want to include on your burger. Had I known that, I would have ordered something completely different. But the food and the service was all around enjoyable and I'll be going back, if not to this location to another location.",

What I really like at Five Guys is the ability to pick any and all of the toppings and not have to pay extra, with the exception of bacon and cheese. The regular size left me disappointed as it is simply two patties from the \"little\" size, and not a thicker, juicier patty (as Carl's Jr. does with their regular and \"$6 burger\" versions). I much prefer the \"little\" size as the meat/veggie ratio is more ideal. The cajun fries also disappointed me as they are simply regular fries with seasoned salt thrown on them.  Now, as I am originally from California, and since everyone is making that annoying comparison I might as well put in my .02 for potential customers. The buns feel store-bought, fresh from the bag on Aisle 6, not the toasted ones of INO. The fries are pretty good - typical more of a restaurant than of fast food (though I really like INO fries). There are no shakes. =( It is not as cheap as INO, but close to the same value. You pay more but get more. If you're like me, a fan of toppings (peppers, bbq sauce, grilled onions and mushrooms at no extra charge), you will love this place. If you prefer the subtle freshness and simplicity of INO you will not find that here.  Right now I couldn't place 5G above INO, nor could I place it below. They each have their strengths and weaknesses. If 5G offered the sweet potato fries from down the street, had better buns and/or offered shakes, I would rate them above INO.",

The food quality of the burger was great, and the bun may have been the best part. The lettuce, however was slightly brown in areas and the tomato was terribly out of season. Good fries, but a small could feed four people. The amount of fries was ridiculous and gimmicky. I'd like to have seen this chain go for local beef, potatoes, and produce. That's a \"gimmick\" that would impress me more.",

    "text": "Great burgers, but it's hard to get the cost right when you're eating alone, since the portions are completely wrong for individual diners at lunchtime. The words they use for sizes are very poorly calibrated, with their idea of \"small\" being a normal place's idea of \"large.\" They do this to upsell you to more food than you need.  I'm a guy, 6'3\", and I've got a big appetite, but their \"little\" burgers are definitely adequate for lunchtime. The \"regular\" burgers, by comparison, are the same as the \"little\" burgers, just with two beef patties instead of one. So in other words, it's totally a marketing thing designed to upsell you to more food than you need. \"Little\" is actually \"regular\", and \"regular\" is actually \"extra large.\"  Unfortunately, fries work the same way. The \"regular\" fries are the smallest size on the menu, but they're easily large enough for two people. In other words, the minimum amount of fries you can order is still, in effect, an \"extra large.\"  I guess maybe this is just designed as a group place. So if you're a lone diner, be prepared to buy too much food if you really want to get a burger AND fries. If you get a little burger and a regular fries, it's the equivalent of another place's regular burger and extra large fries.  Overall, three stars, because the food really is very good. It's just a shame they have a deceptive sizing/price structure.",

The burger comes with grilled onions, ketchup, mustard, pickles, mayo, and I think something else. The thing is, you can't order it the way you want it. I tried to remove onions and mayo from the order and the cashier told me it was all or nothing. We \"negotiated\" a bit and I was finally get her to remove the mayo. Or so I thought.   The burger I got had everything, including the mayo that I did not want, and was missing the ketchup that I did want. The burger was ok but nothing special. It lacked salt and pepper. The fries were horrible with a capital H. I don't care if they are \"fresh\" from Idaho (they have sacks sitting on the floor to show how fresh they are; kinda weird if you ask me). The fries were limp and greasy!!! I could not finish them. I ate a few and threw the rest away. A complete waste of $2.49 for a small. And my stomach was immediately queasy after eating.   This place was popular, however, and I had to wait a while for my burger to be cooked. It is beyond me why. I guess either college students don't have good taste or I am out of touch with what passes for quality these days.",

I had the cheeseburger with sauteed mushrooms and sauteed onions. They went really light on the topping only under the bottom of the two toppings to the point I could barely taste them. I find it only marginally better than a McDonald's quarter pounder with cheese, as another reviewer commented. That much said In-n-Out doesn't do much for me either, so I can see how some might disagree.  I much prefer burgers where they grind their own beef and you can get something besides super well-done... I used to really like Fuddruckers before they went out of business.",

On the burger side, meh.   I ordered what I thought was a regular cheeseburger. Thankfully the chick at the register told me their \"regular\" is actually a double patty. Um, this truly is an influence of American culture super sizing. Ok, I'm getting off my box now...I opted for the single patty, which was the little hamburger.   Little - normal portion. Keep that in mind when ordering!   The burger itself was ok. Definitely not life changing. And believe me, I've had myself a life changing burger in the burgh! Cough, cough....Wingharts...cough, cough.   So if McDonald's and Five Guys were the last Fast Food restaurants on earth....I would go with Five Guys. Not saying much, right?",

ANYWAYS, pros are: Free peanuts while you wait, you can make your burger a junior size instead of the monstrous size, and there's a bunch of toppings for you to customize your burger. Cons are: the fries are too thick for my liking, too satly and oily, and not much flavor even though I ordered it cajun style. The burgers need those customized toppings or else their regular cheeseburger just tastes mundane, nothing to brag about.   It's not comparable to In & Out though. It's more like Fatburger's style of how they make their burgers and the taste of it. They too have the same concept and same ordering style, minus the free peanuts.",

    "text": "Located right in the middle of Pitt campus, Five Guys is a super convenient, quick, and relatively affordable place to grab a bite (I say relatively only because for a college campus, it's pretty in the middle, price wise). I didn't go much when I was actually in undergrad, since my roommate was very allergic to peanuts and I didn't want to risk bringing some peanut dust home with me.   Just stopped by last week after finishing some assignments on campus, and got a burger and small boat of peanuts. The burger was tasty - they have a long list of toppings that can be added on to customize. The bun held up well, although I did have a bit of grease drip from the bottom bun halfway through, so it ended up a little messy. Overall a good place to stop for a quick meal. Small, but comprehensive menu of burgers, fries, grilled cheese, and shakes (I think hot dogs as well?) so it's easy to decide quickly.",

    "text": "!!!People with peanut allergies should give this restaurant a hard pass-- they offer free peanuts around the restaurant and use peanut oil.!!!  Conveniently located, reasonably priced, and consistently good food-- this is a great location to get burgers, shakes and fries. Customary to Five Guys locations, you have a great deal of flexibility in customizing your burgers here-- just make sure you keep an eye on the menu before you order. (The regular hamburger comes with two patties!) Ingredients taste fresh, and every burger is made to order, so it's warm and nothing is soggy. The buns are probably the least impressive part of the burger, and it often arrives to pickup a bit squished.   Fries are tasty, served in a cup. These are also made to order, and most of the time seem to take a little longer than the burgers themselves. There's always a cute sign telling you where the potatoes came from as well. Sometimes the fries come a bit unevenly cooked-- some are crispy and hard, others slightly soggy-- but they are always fully cooked and one order of fries is more than enough to share. (Beware that the fries are drenched in oil which often seeps through your to-go bag!)  I am a fan of the milkshakes, which are large and offered with lots of whipped cream. The milkshakes come in a variety of flavors, and each one is dense enough to keep you full, even without a burger.   This location caters to students, which means that it can be a tight squeeze during peak hours. Music is played decently loudly and staff yells out numbers for order pickup-- so perhaps not the best place to study or go on a date, but a great place to grab a bite and hang out with friends.",

I definitely didn't feel the grease overwhelm me as I do feel with some types of fast food sometimes. I got the Little Hamburger, which was just right for me in terms of portions. I got typical toppings of tomatoes, pickles, and lettuce, and I found it nice that there were several options for customization. Complimentary peanuts were a plus, and I had a great time snacking on peanuts while waiting for my burger! A good experience overall!",

The burgers are are thin patties that cook fast and are so juicy. So if you are a big fan of big thick patties this isnt the place for you. However with two patties it is the same as one big thick burger. However the thin patties are more juicy. Also if you order fries for yourself, order the small. They over fill the cup and and you get about one or two more cup size of fries in the bag that you give you that has your order.",

Try the strawberry milkshake with extra whipped cream and you won't be disappointed; there are actual bits of strawberry in it! But let's talk about the set up. As expected, this restaurant is smaller than most Five Guys restaurants because it's located in the city. Understandable. What I don't understand is why the left door is an 'Exit' only door. You have to enter the right door just to walk to the left side of the store to order your food, because pick up is on right. Like what? Other than this setup, great service and good food.",

Plus, I was a bit worried about previous reviews' negative comments about customer service and cleanliness but the cashier was really prompt and kind and cleaned our table as soon as he could! :) Might have been the late hour because not a lot of people were present but those negative points have been dispelled in my mind.",

The fries are delicious and they even let you know where the potatoes for the day's fries were grown. There are boxes of peanuts in the shell for customers to shell and eat while you wait for your burger and fries to be cooked. It's one place I happily recommend.
