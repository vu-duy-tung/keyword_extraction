Our server was polite and prompt - she even chatted with us a bit at the end, and showed her interest in world travel. Do not overlook this place!",

Once our food was delivered, we immediately asked for pita to go with the hummus we'd ordered. 10 minutes later, we had to walk inside to get it so we could finish our food. Unfortunately, we had to wait again after our meal for the waitress to return to fill our water glasses and give us the check. The food was very tasty, but at $75 for 4 of us, it's just not worth not-so-great service.",

    "text": "Before I go into why I'm giving this place 3 stars, let me point out that you will not be disappointed with the food. It is, by far, the tastiest and subtle Mediterranean food I've eaten bar none.   The service, otoh, is mediocre and so the 3 stars. I got to the restaurant around 1:30 and was going to eat alone. The place was mostly empty with a few parties halfway through their meals. The host unceremoniously dumped me into a back table behind a glass wall without so much as asking if I wanted to be seated at one of the other available tables near the window. I get that I'm no eye candy :) but I love sitting at windows to people watch too!!  Then, my waiter was didn't even ask me if wanted to order. I had to tell him what I was having as an appetizer (a yum carrot/banana smoothie.) After bringing me the smoothie, he disappeared for about 5-6 minutes without giving me a chance to order the main course.   I sat there twiddling my thumbs and was midway through my smoothie before he reappeared to take my order. In the meanwhile, I pretended not to be able to hear the conversation at the table next to mine. I ordered a pita roll which was fantastic.   After finishing the pita roll, I again sat around desperately trying to find something to do on my cellphone while waiting for the waiter to clear the table and get me my check. After I paid up, he again took his own sweet time coming back with the credit card bill for me to sign.   I must say that the other wait staff seemed a lot more prompt with their service. My guy didn't make any effort to make me feel welcome or make small talk seeing how I was sitting alone.  Anyway, if you're going there for the food, you won't be disappointed.",

The portions are pretty generous - so you might actually be able to make this (Veg. Combo) your main entree. It's got bit of everything including homemade hummus.  For the entree, we ordered the Chicken Salad, Aladdin's Fav Combo and a lamb plate. Although, I've read rave reviews about the lamb - I didn't quite enjoy that much - however, my girlfriend loved it. The chicken Salad was amazingly delicious - and the Beef Kafta that came with the combo platter was really good.  The service was great - our server was very attentive and friendly.  Would definitely go back again.",

    "text": "On the low end of last week, a co-worker with a Lebanese wife brought me some kibbie, something I've only had once before at Crystal on Penn. Once I tasted it, I knew it was superior to CoP's in that it was simply more succulent. When I asked him where it was from, he said, \"I think it's from Aladdin's. Either that or Khalil's.\"  Another co-worker commented, saying that the kibbie resembled \"a turd.\" I told him that he in fact was \"a turd.\" He then went about his business.    Considering that there's an Aladdin's near me in Mt. Lebanon with more expanded hours of operation than Khalil's, I took Kay there this past Friday night.   Sure enough, that fried acorn of loose meat I had at Aladdin's was the same one I had at work. Served with a cup on non-fat yogurt and a chunky Lebanese Salata, anything else becomes extraneous.   Co-Worker of Darren W. also recommended the Lamb Roll, but I opted instead for the Shawarma Roll and was not disappointed. A thin, toasted pita scroll is filled with turnips (!), parsley, tomato, onion, lettuce, pickles, a Tahini yogurt dressing, and of course generous strips of seasoned beef. Terrific and inexpensive at under $6, Aladdin's turned in a torpedo of flavor if there ever was one.   The accompanying house salad was very similar, if not exactly the same as the one we had with our kibbie, the Aladdin's house dressing jazzing it up superbly.  I tasted the hummus, Chicken Mishwi, and Beef Kafta that populated Kay's Flavor Savor Special and enjoyed all 3. The hummus was particularly creamy without sacrificing its unique chickpea flavor and texture. Hey, forget chips and dip. Gimme some pita bread and hummus, and I'll be happier AND healthier.  Which brings me to what I'm really liking about Aladdin's; their food is good for you and doesn't skimp at all on taste. That Aladdin's is a chain specializing in Arabic food is interesting enough.That their menu might help you lose weight is a wish that could only be granted by the most benevolent of Djinn. That their food is so economical almost qualifies them for non-profit status.   That they have such a seductive array of desserts available almost makes them a culinary brothel.   Kay and I shared the Chocolate Fantasy cake (one of many choices, and they didn't have everything at the moment!). I loved the moussy/buttercreamish chocolate icing but found the cake itself to be a little on the day-old side.   Dana, our waitress, was an absolute dear who went out of her way to explain every single dish we ordered as well as share her culture and ethnic background with us.   Aladdin's doesn't build bridges like exotic cuisine often does. Instead, they whisk you up and over the mountains, oceans, seas, and deserts on magic carpets for a taste of the Middle East before bringing you back home.",

The food is fresh, delicious and usually served with a smile. My go to meal here is the turkey rolled pita, side salad with Aladdin's dressing and an appetizer of hummus. Usually a glass of wine or iced tea (theirs is pretty special) and a slice of cheesecake at the end too. Pretty basic but never disappoints. I love meeting friends here and sitting back to relax and have a nice meal. We take our time, enjoy ourselves and never feel rushed. Truly no complaints here! Two tips: mix the hot sauce in the hummus. And if your feeling extra adventurous throw the garlic sauce in there too. Amazing.",

So sorry for whoever has to talk to me the next day.....   I had heard SO many good things about this place that it had been on my places to try list for a while now. It absolutely did NOT disappoint! Thanks to Carrie L.'s suggestion, I got the Mediterranean Lamb Plate. The lamb was cooked to perfection and surprisingly had little fat for lamb. The rice was also fantastic, because who doesn't love a little sprinkle of pine nuts on top!? I was really not too keen about the Greek yogurt sauce but LOVED the garlic sauce (hence the garlic dragon breathe!).   The decor inside is also really cute! I love the glass accent pieces and I really wanted to keif the little vases with cute wooden flowers on our table. Since I try not steal....I did not....don't worry!   For a Mediterranean place to also be famous for desserts is a big surprising. But I had also heard many good things about their choice of cakes and cheesecakes. I had JUST been to the Factory of Cheese earlier in the week so I opted for a Coconut Cake. I love me some coconut and it was the perfect combo of moist cake and coconut! Yum-o!   They need a location downtown! I have to hike it to the burbs or Squirrel Hill for my fix now. But it'll be oh so worth it!",

    "text": "At one time in my life I ate from Aladdin's fairly regularly.  I happened to be working in the Squirrel Hill area, and would order, or dine-in at least twice a week, if not more.  That was approximately five, or so, years ago. Tonight, I found myself in Mt. Lebo.  I had to pick up a bridesmaid dress, and had not yet eaten.  After leaving the dress shop and yelping nearby vegetarian options, I came across an Aladdin's location less than a half of a mile away from me. I drove straight there hoping that Aladdin's was still everything I remembered. I was greeted by smiling faces, which is always cool. The smiling faces continued when I was greeted by my server, Haley. She was wonderful. I am a terrible decision maker, and was dining solo, so she helped me tremendously.  And by tremendously, I mean she made my decisions for me. If she hated me as a result, she hid it very well. She brought me either the natural energy, or the honeymooner juice. It was awesome, and has me wanting to go back to try others. I told her that there was a chance she was going to hate me, and asked that she bring me a vegan option, otherwise, I would have stared at that menu for another hour at least. She returned, not long after, with the hummus falafel rolled.  I'm considering driving back as I type this to eat it again. It was fabulous. A great balance, not overstuffed, so I didn't feel like a slob while eating it and facing the passersby. The pickles rolled in added the perfect crunch. I took two desserts home with me. Yes..two. I've tried some of both with my coffee this morning. Excellent choice. Blueberry bar and a peanut butter and jelly cookie. Their dessert case looks amazing, but I stuck with the vegan options. Unfortunately, I live about an hour from any Aladdin's, but hopefully I will be returning to this location soon, and hopefully Haley will be working again. Fabulous food and service made for a great solo dining experience.",

You cam get falafel as an appetizer or in various sandwiches or salads. There are a ton of vegetarian options. The mujadra plate is a favorite of mine. I also recommend the smoothies.   Everything is quite affordable except the dessert, which runs about $6 for a slice of cake. Two people can dine here and get an appetizer and beverages for around $20.  The service is generally pretty good as well.    If you're looking for a greasy, very filling meal, this isn't the place for you. But if you like Mediterranean, I highly recommend Aladdin's.",

There is also a parking garage just across the street if you don't find parking on the street.  This is my favorite Mediterranean place so far in Pittsburgh. Delicious!",

I had the vegetarian sampler platter -- dolmades, hummus, falafel, and baba ghanoush, served with a stack of pita.  Everything was very fresh, and all of the bright herbal flavors that you expect of Middle Eastern food were there.  It was absolutely delicious, and enough food for two meals. (I ordered for carryout).  For dessert I had a wonderful little two- or three bite pastry....shredded wheat wrapped around a slightly-sweet bundle of pistachio nuts.  Not as sweet as baklava, but the server recommended it after I told her I can't eat walnuts.  My only suggestion?  For the vegetarian platter, a couple of kalamata olives and a few chunks of feta would have been a nice addition.  Otherwise it was a nice lunch, and well worth the price.",

We never really knew what to expect from this place or had and big interest in trying it out, until this one evening. We spontaneously decided to give it a shot and we are very happy we did. I was very pleased with the food options, as they were mostly very healthy and very affordable.    Most of the dishes we never heard of before, but our server was very informative and gave great advice on what we should try for our first time here. The app we had chosen was their vegetarian combo. Included in this was wrapped grape leaves. I have never been a big fan of this, but theirs was very good. Their pita bread and hummus was very yummy as well. I had also ordered their vegi soup, which of very filling and had a great variety of vegis in it, including garbanzo beans and potatoes. We had ordered two entrees. One was the Aladdin pitza, which was very good, and we ordered the Lebanese vegi dish that was served on top of a rice. I was honestly so full after the app and soup that the entrees made it home for a second meal. not complaining about that!   If your one for gluten free and vegetarian options, then this will be the place for you! I was so full leaving here, but did not feel at all guilty about it. The service was very good. The restaurant is set in a great location, right on Washington road. They have 2 parking garages near by if there is no parking on the street. And their deserts... They have so many! Cheesecakes, Cakes, and few other options as well. I usually write EVERYTHING down about the menus and what is in the dishes, but my mind got away from me this evening. I know they have take out. They are also kid friendly as well, with a nice menu for them. The bathroom is a little strange though (two toilets, no stalls). The restaurant itself is nice, but casual. Reminds me a little bit of a panara bread decor, but with touches of Lebanese. They have glass panels to separate every few tables to give a feeling of intimacy and not a cafe feel. We will be back here again for sure!",

I think all locations are equally as good, there's really not much difference between the locations.  I always start with the hummus, so good. Some of my favorite dishes are; Len-Chili soup, falafel wrap, mujadara plate, Jaffar & Greek pitzas and the mujadara pocket.  Everything is made fresh, they use fresh ingredients & only olive oil when cooking.  Their smoothies are great too. They use all fruits & veggies and no added sugars.  And don't forget about dessert. Aladdin's has some of the best cakes around Pittsburgh. All desserts are made fresh and local. You have a choice from about 10 different cakes and you can't go wrong with whichever one you choose.  Service is always good. They also have outside tables which I love bringing my dogs with me when I eat there.  If you're looking for some really great food that is also healthy for you then Aladdin's is a must.",

Everything on their menu is so fresh, flavorful, and light, you will be hard-pressed to find something that isn't delightful. They offer loads of gluten free and vegetarian options, plus an array of meat dishes. The atmosphere inside the restaurant is simple, yet sophisticated. Everything on their menu is made fresh-to-order daily. Start with an appetizer like the hummus, tabbouleh, baba ganoush, or falafel, all served with bottomless, fresh warm pita. Or one of their made-from-scratch soups like the lentil, chili, or combine the two in one, add chicken or keep it vegetarian, topped with fresh cheddar or feta cheese. For an entree their rolled pitas are lightly toasted and served warm and much more filling than you might think. Choose from about 20 different options, and don't forget to order their house-made hot sauce on the side, which has just the perfect combination of spice, sweet, and salt, this could be eating by the spoonful. All their salads come served with one of their five homemade dressing, the 'Aladdin's Dressing,' a light, sweet, and tangy lemon vinaigrette is by far the best seller. And surely you will regret it if you pass up their baklava, the perfect little triangular-sized portion topped with fresh pistachios, it is by far the best baklava I have found in the city of Pittsburgh. On top of every menu item being so tasty, the prices are so affordable! Love this place for lunch, dinner, dine-in, or carry out, you cannot go wrong with this restaurant!",

The chicken salad wrap is a crowd pleaser, and the v-9 soup (nine vegetables, although I've never managed to count past seven), grape leaves and hummus are heaven. Their wines are limited but half decent and very reasonable. And my elementary school-aged children are willing to try new things. A miracle! Service speed can be a bit spotty at times, so my advice is to order your entree when you order drinks if you are in a rush.",

They offer various vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options. However stay clear if you are allergic to nuts and lentils.  I highly recommend the staples (hummus, tabouli, chili, and falafel) and the Aladdins Chicken Pitza- pita flatbread with chicken, green peppers, and scallions on a sweet honey mustard sauce. Yummy for adults but also a LOVE for kids. Don't forget the HUGE sweets that they have on display for dessert. If the portions are too huge, definitely get the smaller but equally as delicious diamond baklava.  Staff is friendly and helpful when making decisions. I usually don't want longer than 15/20 minutes for food. I will go back again and again!",

No matter what you get you have to get the garlic sauce for your pita. It's so good. (However, I've been told that it's basically mayo and garlic) There is an extra fee for it but it's worth it!   Parking can sometimes challenging but that's basically every restaurant in that area. If on street parking is hard to find there's always space in the parking garage on the left.",

We trundled down here one afternoon after eating regular vegan fast food became a little blah. We love anything on a plate that isn't part of a dead being so any ethnicity will do.   Though this spot is supposed to be Lebanese there are a lot of middle eastern mixes in here that we've tried in a lot of countries around the globe.   Portions - HUGE. I mean very large. Unless you've managed to stretch out your stomach significantly, you will need a doggy bag. And should need one - as a fitness coach I have to say be responsible and make it a late night snack or lunch the next day. Flavours were right on, we didn't get anything too spicy, had some hummus, grape leaves, soup and something else I can't remember. At any rate, delicious and the salad - right I got a Fatoush - dressing was wonderful. Get it on the side and take some home it's got a lovely mint flavouring. It's a lot of oil so I recommend getting dressings on the side.   Tonnes of seating - don't fret about getting a seat midday during the week at all. We were a little unimpressed by the lack of table bussing but it's not a swish swish place so, lowered expectations, right?   Service was ok, friendly enough staff, pretty fast and generally polite.   We didn't try a dessert because it's training season for spring bodybuilding competitions BUT you should try them because they were plentiful.   Not too bad of a price point for the fact that we got lunch the next day as well.   Worth a stop by for sure.",

I can easily walk to it, sit down in one of the cozy little booths in this not-to-big-not-to-small joint, mull over exactly what I want, and never be disappointed - plus, I always get my food very quickly, so whoever is in this kitchen, keep doing what you're doing!   If you're looking to get an appetizer with your meal, I highly recommend the pita and/or salads, which always have super tasty seasonings - they're super flavorful ways to start your meal off for sure. As for the main course, while there's a pretty decent number of options I'm addicted to their rolled pitas, which range from basic chicken and honey mustard dishes to Mediterranean-styled lamb or beef pitas, complete with special house sauces and dressings.  I rarely get their desserts, not from lack of quality but from lack of room - the food here is extremely filling, even if you split it with a friend like I often to. That said, I can testify from my occasional splurges that the desserts here are pretty darn good, so long as you're in the mood for cake. If not, there's both a frozen yogurt and an ice cream shop a block or two down the road. They're super easy to get to and find, assuming that you don't opt to order your dinner online in advance and then take it home, although I think this service is more there to allow someone to plan hours in advance, as opposed to suddenly deciding, Hey I want Aladdin's! At that point you may as well go to the restaurant, since they don't deliver.  Man, just writing a review about this perfectly placed restaurant with its amazing food is making me hungry...maybe I'll need to treat myself to some Aladdin's this week!",

Unfortunately in the South Hills your options are pretty limited.  We had been meaning to give Aladdin's a try so we decided to stop.  From the time we walked in we were treated amazing by the staff.  Our server was fun and friendly, and explained the dishes they were known for and her recommendations.  They were also playing some music which added to the great experience.  For an appetizer we went with the servers recommendation of the spicy cauliflower.  The cauliflower was lightly crisped and coated in two different sauces.  One seemed spicy and one seemed sweet, which made for a very different and great taste.  The cauliflower was cooked perfectly as well.  For my meal I went with Farmer's Pita Pitza.  I love pita bread and love pizza so these dishes they offer were an easy pick.  Mine came topped with garlic sauce, hot sauce, cheddar cheese, spinach, yellow squash, zucchini, mushrooms, tomatoes, and banana peppers.  All of the different ingredients came together for an amazing flavor.  Every bite tasted super fresh and delicious.  I also had an extra side of the hot sauce which is a must!   I can't wait to go back to try their hummus, grape leaves, and their other options.",

    "text": "Fresh, healthy and delicious! I always have a difficult time deciding what to eat because the menu is full of great choices. I love to start with the vegetarian platter (if I'm sharing because it's a lot of food). Stuffed grape leaves, tangy with lemon. Smooth hummus, pita and falafel, and my favorite baba ganouj. The pita pizza's are good as are the rolls. I love the baba, falafel roll.  If I'm feeling carnivorous, the Aladdin's favorite with Kafta, the shishkabob, or the lamb plate.  The desserts are so good, cheesecake, chocolate, coconut cakes, baclava, again difficult choices. The only thing that I would change is that I would expand on the beer choices, a draft beer is so much better than a bottled one.",

I got the chicken shawarma in a pita wrap and a Mediterranean salad. The pita itself was pretty small but the salad was bigger than I had expected. The salad was a bit oily but delicious! It felt very fresh and light which balanced out the chicken shawarma pita. I had tried the tiramisu which was also delicious! They have such a selection for food and desserts that one will find something to choose from.",

    "text": "Aladdin's on Washington Road is a decent place to get some vegetable -forward Mediterranean food.  I would classify this place as a Mediterranean deli: not fancy, but solid options.   I ordered a gyro salad and the flavor was a bit flat. The whole dish screamed for some salt. I really appreciate the freshness of the vegetables, though, so the flavors came together once I got my hands on the salt shaker. Their hummus is yummy and seasoned well.   The really issue was the service. Our waiter was A MESS. He was overly casual to a point of discomfort, and he leaned on a table at one point while he was talking to us. A server should NEVER put their bum on another table, even if it is unoccupied. This made the entire meal really awkward.   I would definitely order take-out from Aladdin's, but I don't know if I would choose to eat in-house again.",

Favorite items on their menu for me is the Jasmines Favorite Rice with Shish Kabob (beef), their Hummus (which is extremely well blended and delicious in its own right), their Rolled Pita (shish kabob or dawali, both are my favorites), and their Dawali straight up.  They also have a delicious Spicy Cauliflower appetizer which is amazingly delicious and can be it's own meal if you want it to be.  Highly recommend Alladins.",

    "text": "Stopped here for dinner on a Monday evening with my friend.  The first thing you see when you walk in is the case of desserts; they all looked delicious and I had to avert my eyes to stay on my healthy eating goal! The restaurant was buzzing but we didn't have to wait at all to be seated.   Our waitress was very friendly and she had a trainee with her so we received excellent customer service throughout the entire meal; they were consistently checking on us!  We picked Aladdin's to try and satisfy both of our dietary restrictions (Mine is low carbs and my friend is vegan).  After doing some research on the menu, she was very impressed with all of the vegan options (not just salads, but vegan wraps, soups, appetizers, and bowls! They also customized her smoothie order to be vegan which she was very thankful for.   I myself hose the baba ganouj appetizer with vegetable dippers instead of warm pita. It comes in three sizes- small, regular, and large. I got the regular portion since I was getting a light salad entree, and it ended up being about 4 cups of spread which was a lot for me, I took about half home! In hindsight a solo person should probably get the small size as the regular seems to be for sharing!  I also got the Lebanese Salata, a salad of spring mix greens, parsley, cucumbers, onions, tomatoes, and olive oil/lemon juice dressing. It was excellent and also a large portion. I was very happy with it.  As a side note: it is very wet, the remaining salad did not survive for lunch the next day.  One thing I didn't like was how it seems we weren't getting the full picture when ordering.  When I asked for the baba dish with vegetables instead of pita, I was charged for the vegetables as if I just ordered them on the side. The waitress did not mention it would be an up charge. She also asked if I wanted hot sauce on it and did not mention 'would you like to 'add on' hot sauce'? Same goes for my friends salad. She asked if my friend would like a soup or salad with her wrap, and it was extra. But it came off like would you like a choice between a soup or a salad, not would you like to ADD a soup or salad. I mean maybe it was just this particular waitress's way of communicating, but it was confusing. If you aren't sure, definitely ask does this come with a side dish? Is it an up charge to substitute so-and-so? Etc!  I will go back again because it was really awesome that we found a place that, like I said, can work for both of our dietary restrictions! The food was very good and it was an easy walk from the parking garage across the street.",

Hummus was way too creamy and soupy for my liking and pita bread didn't really excite me.  Pita didn't taste much fresher than something I would get in the store. Thought the lamb shawarma pita wrap was tasty, but on the small side and a little off -- being presented fully wrapped in printed tin foil. Kind of felt like I was at chipotle or a fast food spot.  Even if this was present in plain tin foil, half wrapped -- that would have been more appealing. Service was friendly and attentive, but I'm certainly not dying to go back again for the food.",

There is hummus, baba ganoush, tabbouleh, falafel, and some grape leaves. The tabbouleh was nice and fresh. Their pita is very standard nothing special. For dinner, I had the lamb pita roll. The roll was fine. My issue was that the lamb was so chewy, it made the roll quite difficult to eat. My friend enjoyed his chicken sambusek. Overall, they have a great variety of options for mediterranean food and the prices are very reasonable. I just was not wowed by the meal.",

    "text": "Stopped here for lunch while touring the Mt. Lebanon business district.  I was greeted and seated promptly. I did learn the following upon arrival: Yelp is offering a $10.00 voucher for $5.00 if you wish to purchase it. I'm always for good deals so that was a great savings. Also, they do not validate garage parking if you parking in one of Mt. Lebanon's indoor garages.  The menu is vast and extensive but my waiter was kind enough to explain the choices to me and help me come up with a decision. I opted for the chicken tender salad that came with cucumbers, grapes, and cranberries to name a few. This is a Mediterranean style restaurant so you can get a lot of meatless sandwiches and flatbreads.   Your are served a basket of pita bread but nothing to dip it with. I inquired about that and learned that if I wanted hummus or anything else for that matter then it would cost me around $3.95. I politely declined. To me, that is like serving you a basket of bread without butter and then charging you for the butter.  My salad came in record time and I was indeed pleased with both the presentation as well as the taste. It wasn't overfilling but enough for me. They have as you enter a case displaying various cakes if you want for dessert but I decided to pass on that one.  Another item of note is that when I went to the ladies room I noticed they have two toilets but neither of them have private stall coverings. Although they are not side by side, still it could pose a bit of a problem for women.  With the savings of $10.00 I actually in the long run was glad that they could shave $5.00 off my check.  Aladdin's is a chain so you will find it in other parts of the city. This is the first time I ever visited one and may check a different one out in my travels.",

I ordered a pizza and it  had chicken on a pita bread with honey mustard and to be honest with you it was a lack of imagination for a foodie myself .  drinks were fine service polite and professional  atmosphere was good place was very clean and dessert was decent . the hummus didn't have enough lemon for any Lebanese I've tasted in Beirut and the baba ghanouj obviously it was burned when they made it from the eggplant into the sauce you could taste it because of the complete charring and babaghanouj and it both lacked salt . I would say for a gentle representation of the cuisine for people whose never experience the authentic one it's palatable I'm very sorry to say I will not be returning.

    "text": "Aladdin's is one of my favorite restaurants and a great fallback when there's no where else I want to go. Don't let the Lebanese/Middle Eastern/Mediterranean label scare you- Aladdin's has something for everyone. First off, everything at Aladdin's is fresh and delicious. I've never had anything there that wasn't made well or seemed to come from a box. The lettuce is always crispy, the meats fresh and juicy, and I love their pita. Plus, with so many vegetarian dishes on the menu, I doubt there will be too many people that can find a fault with Aladdin's. My favorite thing to get on the menu is the Flavor Savor Plate. It has a bunch of the best from Aladdin's, with Chicken Mishwi, Beef Kafta, rice, salad, hummos, and Falaffel (mmm... Falaffel). They also have a dozen other plates with all kinds of chicken, lamb, beef, and other combinations that will make your head spin, but if you have no idea what to order, get the Flavor Savor and you'll get a little bit of the best on the menu- plus at $9.95, you can't beat the price and will probably have leftovers. Aladdin's also has these amazing stuffed pitas. They take fresh lettuce, tomatoes, and onions, and overstuff them into a pita pocket. Then, they put a meat on it, a choice of feta or cheddar cheese, and dressing. These things are huge, and my favorite is the tuna pocket. The tuna is big chunks of tuna steak that is cubed and grilled with seasonings- yum. I've also tried several of their pita pizzas, which have a crispy pita base and lots of choices on toppings. There also wraps, rolls, cheese pies, stuffed grape leaves, and lots more- the menu will make your head spin. For an appetizer, you can't go wrong with their hummos. Finally, make sure you leave room for dessert. Despite their Middle Eastern menu, they have very Americanized desserts that are freaking awesome. You can't miss them when you walk in- they're in a case at the front entrance. These monster cakes are incredible, and could have anything from double chocolate cake, to red velvet cake, carrot cake, or lots of others. The cakes are huge, and the portions are giant. Many times, I come here just for dessert. They also usually have two or three different kinds of baklava, which are moist and sweet and better then my grandmother's (sorry Nene). Are you still reading?? Why haven't you headed over to Aladdin's yet? Don't worry, the place is casual, so you don't even have to dress up, and you'll want to bring a friend because the portions are big and you'll want to share. Enjoy!",

I had never been to Aladdin's and was pleasantly surprised by their emphasis on fresh, wholesome ingredients. I ordered Aladdin's favorite combo to get a taste of beef, chicken and kabob. When the meal was served, I was a litle disappointed in the quantity. There was about 2 ounces of each meat. Just enough for about three to four bites. It truly was a taste of each. For the cost, I was expecting a little more. However, the quality of the meal was exceptional. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. The meats were juicy and tender. The meal also was served with a small mixed green salad on the side.True mixed greens, no iceberg here. I chose to try Aladdin's dressing which was tangy and delicious. Not being on a diet and having been deprved of chocolate all day, I decided on the most decident chocolate cake I could order. This tower of chocolateness had layers of choclate cake held toegther by chocolate mouse and chocolate ganache. A True choclate lovers dream. All in all, I will for sure head back to Aladdin's for a fresh, casual meal in a relaxed atmosphere.",

We chose the latter. The stuffed grape leaves were tasty, and I wolfed down the Lebanese Salata. Stephen J. ordered lamb and liked it, though I think there was too much time between when the food was picked up and when we actually consumed it, as he felt there may have been a change in texture of his dish as it cooled. Our friends who go there once a month or so are most definitely fans.",

Had the soup for the first time! The veggies were out of this world. Think the broth was from scratch. I'm on a diet and this place kept me on it. Lamb had a beautiful crust and sear on it. The fresh garnish on on the plate was a nice touch. The ice tea was really good don't often comment on drinks, but I just can't get enough of aladdin. The waiter was really nice kudos to him being so honest with the suggestions and also, finding my favorite hat and putting it in a safe place. The portion will say is kinda small for price. It was a lil pricey for 2 people. But, that's what you get with fresh and homemade food. Hope to get that waiter again just wish it was nicer to sit outside. I always feel satisfied and full when I leave aladdins. The place is good for special occasions also. It's a fancy decor. The place is Mediterranean. They had a pretty neat design where their was rice different type of seeds and beans in a glass. This one does the offer for hummus platter you just have to show them thru yelp. But, their WiFi is not really good wish they had one for guests!!! Cause people love wifi!!!! Overall, this place is wonderful I highly recommend it even if your by yourself and also a good date place!",

My meat-free meal (I try to eat meat-free at least a couple days per week) Jasmine rice with red beans, veggies, + a side of Loubbie (sp?) which is a tasty mix of flat green beans in a beautiful tomato and garlic \"broth\". Actually, I suppose it is a very loose sauce, garlic cloves left whole so that their flavor doesn't over power. Quite yummy.  Others at our table enjoyed lamb, beef, salads, falafel (which is a wee bit spicy here), their super smooth and creamy hummus.   Entree prices a serious bargain between $7.95-maybe $14.  Great service, wine available as is a very strong hot mint tea; and has been said they have a bigtime dessert case with all sorts of decadent and fancy cakes. Sampled last night was a German Chocolate cheesecake (yep) and a very complicated looking chocolate peanut butter layer cake which had alternating types of dark and light cake on each layer so that it was kind of a checkerboard pattern when sliced and was not cloyingly sweet.

    "text": "After eating here a half dozen times I'm finally ready to comment on it. I'm a big fan of Middle Eastern food, and some of what Aladdin's offers delivers. The hummous is very good, and usually I like the falafel, sandwiches and salads. The menu here is varied and interesting, and I've had some good meals here. I ordered take out from this location yesterday and was disappointed. I picked up the veggie sampler for myself and the chicken mishwa salad for Doug. The salad had grit in the lettuce leaves, which is always an unpleasant experience. Even if this had been well prepared, it was a small serving for an entree sized salad. We get a similar salad at My Big Fat Greek Gyro, and it's twice the size, with a dozen olives in it, compared to the three in Aladdin's salad. It's like the old Woody Allen joke. Two women are dining at a restaurant and the first woman says, \"This food is terrible\", and the second woman says, \"Yes, and such small portions, too\". After a couple of bites of this, Doug ate the chicken and olives and gave up on the lettuce. The veggie sampler is too much food for me anyway, so I shared. We both found the falafel too salty, and the stuffed grape leaves were also overly salted and the rice in them a bit undercooked. The hummous was as good as ever, and I enjoyed the baba ganoush, although I like my own homemade version better. When I can make better food than a restaurant, why bother eating there? I guess the answer is convenience. I'm also not a big fan of their pita, which is very thin and dries out quickly. I called the manager and let him know how our lunch went, more to give him a heads up on the sand in the lettuce problem than anything. He offered me a credit for a comparably priced meal, which was very nice, so I'll be trying this place again, and I'll let you know how it goes! I have not tried the cakes and desserts here, as my husband is a pastry chef and we rarely order cake out , but they look beautiful.",
