I got the avocado bahn mi tacos, and they are possibly the best tacos I have ever had- the tempura veggies inside are delicious.  My date loved the Cuban sandwich.  Additionally, the Kaya juice is a perfect blend of fruits - it makes you feel like you are at tropical resort! Thanks for the great time!",

    "text": "The staff inside of the restaurant was very nice. Smiling and saying hello as I passed through to meet my friend who was seating outside. The waitress at our table was probably one of the worst I've ever had, though.   I had my mixed drink and water within minutes of ordering it, which was great. (The mixed drink was basically entirely alcohol and I couldn't manage more than a few sips, so without me even asking, the waitress did remove it from my check at the end of the meal, which I did like/appreciate.)   I ordered a sprite to try to wash taste of the mixed drink from my mouth. About 25 minutes after ordering, I finally stopped the waitress while she was walking away from helping another table, to ask for the sprite again. I finally received it about 6 minutes after that.   My friend and I ordered an appetizer but we both only had a few bites as it was pretty horrible. (If I remember correctly, I believe it was three types of hummus and pita bread.) Everything on the platter was bitter while at the same time, tasted the way I imagine cardboard would taste. It was strange.  Our meals arrived about 15 minutes after ordering them, which was lovely. At that time, there were three of us and I think we were all pleased with our main meals. I ordered a burger with waffle fries. (I highly recommend the waffle fries.)  The burger was massive and I couldn't finish even half of it so I asked for a to-go package. The waitress took the plate and brought our check about 10 minutes later, without the packaged burger. I had to stop and grab her again on her way back from helping another table to ask her if the burger had been packaged. She brought it out and sort of tossed it into the table.  I don't think I will ever be eating there again. Well, maybe to order some waffle fries to go. (They were that good.)",

It has an eclectic and fun atmosphere, but isn't too loud to be able to have conversation with dining companions. The owner is always there and likes to walk around and make sure everyone is doing well. They have wonderful drinks and amazing food. I always get the Yucatan Hot Bean Dip to start, which comes with some lovely chips made in-house from yuca (I believe it's yuca but it might be another root vegetable). We recently discovered they have a fantastic Vegetarian Prie Fixe dinner the third Wednesday of each month and though it's on the pricier side (something like $40/person without wine pairings), it is scrumptious and we go every month. I couldn't recommend Kaya more highly and will certainly be headed there again soon!",

Attractive - Fresh - Terrific !

Overall I had a great experience and I'm already looking forward to returning.  The space itself is small but comfortable. Even at lunch time it was pretty dark and cozy. We waited only a few minutes before being seated, and everyone we interacted with was friendly. Our waitress was also knowledgable and answered all of our questions.   I had the Crispy Fish Tacos. For only $12, it came with two large soft-shell tacos that were packed with cabbage slaw, avocado, flaky fish, and a slightly spicy cream sauce. This was, believe it or not, my first fish taco experience and I absolutely loved them! There was also a pre-dressed side salad; I need to find out what the dressing was because it was delicious.   There were so many other options on the menu that sounded good. I'm looking forward to returning to try out the dinner menu and maybe also happy hour.",

In addition to executing well on dishes within its wheelhouse, Kaya manages to far exceed expectations on other fronts as well.  For example, the burger here is easily in the Top 10 I've had in Pittsburgh, and they cooked it better than even many well-known burger places (beating comparable burgers I've ordered at BRGR, Union Grill and Tessaro's).  I also wouldn't overlook Kaya as a stellar brunch option; their menu offers plenty of variety, great flavors, and combinations ranging from classic to inventive.  Not only is Kaya a very good restaurant, it's stunningly well-rounded as well.",

The jerk chicken wings were startlingly spicy, which was a welcome change from other establishments' jerked chicken. I also love their chips. For entrees, the Paella, flank steak and Cuban sandwich were all good. However, on one occasion, a dining companion ordered the Green Curry Vegetables. I had a taste, and we both agreed it was bland. The shrimp he ordered were also a bit undercooked. This would be my lone \"bad experience\" at Kaya. The staff also remedied the problem.   Service is usually friendly and casual. They were kind enough to serve my fiance the calamari free of sauce, with no questions or eyebrow raises.

I think it would have tasted fine without the slaw or perhaps up the taste for the slaw. It just had a sour taste and didn't go well with the pork. The Tropical Paella had chicken, chorizo, mussels, shrimp, bay scallops, sugar snap peas, pineapple and red peppers. This dish was well flavored and the pineapple gave the dish a great touch. There was chunks of everything everywhere, I would say they need more rice with all that stuff! =) We also had an order of Jamaican Jerk Wings with cilantro cream- this was very tasty.

I like the fact that they offer a small sandwich and two small sides for a really reasonable price. I liked the Conch Chowder and the slow roasted pork and banana sandwich was wonderful.  Apparently they're part of a chain of other restaurants that come highly reccomended.  It's a cool neighborhood, kind of like the Metapacking district a few years back or South Philadelphia around 9th st.  A little high end dining, some real ethnic food, and a little historic charm.  Well done.",

    "text": "I recently went to Kaya's monthly vegetarian prix fix dinner, complete with wine pairings. I ordered all of the vegan options. I was not entirely impressed...  The amuse, a beet ceviche, was delicious -- I would have traded out my main course for a big bowl of it. The two bite portion was a True tease.  Course one was roasted potatoes, meh. These were served with a green tomato ketchup which tasted too much like heinz for me to give a shit. OK, it did have notes of apple which was slightly interesting. But also served on the side was a \"sour cream\" and onion dip that was pretty yummy and had hints of horseradish.  I think the \"sour cream\" base is the same as that used at Mad Mex.  Second course was Chilled English Pea Soup. I LOVE raw english peas, thus appreciated the imagination of this soup (I believe it was a raw dish). However, I would have just as soon cracked open fresh pods, enjoying the full texture of nature's candy. Toward the bottom of my bowl of soup, I realized that blenderization diminishes the essence of peas, and felt slightly sad.  Carrot-lime intermezzo -- fine.  Third course was a big disappointment. Roasted Porchini Arepas sounded exciting (\"what are arepas?\"), but it tasted rather plain. The arepa was dry; dying for some of that \"sour cream\" and onion condiment from course one. The mushrooms were delicious, as mushrooms are, and that is my only compliment for this course. Crispy sweet potato fries were served on the side, but again with no condiments and I had had my fill of potatoes at course one. This course lacked moisture and flavor all around.  So why three stars instead of two? Dessert was amazing. \"Strawberry Pound Cake\" is the strawberry short-cake I have been dreaming about for 13 years (about the length of time I have been vegan). Probably not all that difficult to make, but wow, those strawberries were good (I surmise they were local, yay)!  The mignardises, chili chocolate, was like a slightly spicy m&m. Cute.  To quote Kaya's website, \"The menus emphasize flavor and variety, presenting familiar foods in exciting ways, and making exotic foods delightfully accessible.\" I feel that exotic foods were completely lacking from this meal and that the emphasis was placed on creativity with familiar foods. Plantains would have been an excellent substitution for one of the potato dishes. The meal was full of \"American\" flavor with very little suggestion of \"island\" influence (ie. lime and cilantro). Perhaps they strive to use local ingredients, which would be cool, but there were no indications of that on the menu. No, I am not going to lay into a discourse to define \"American\" cusine, but hey, the restaurant is located in the U.S., admittedly serves \"fusion\" styles and the kitchen boys were white; probably studied culinary arts in 'merica. I mean that one should not expect an exotic experience at Kaya, though one should expect, demand even, an imaginative and quality meal.  The wine pairings were all perfectly on point; I owe much to this in creating what was generally a lovely meal.   The service was also excellent. We had come in from the rain and were soaked; the host brought us towels to dry ourselves. Our server made intense eye contact which, in my eyes, made her an attentive communicator.  The ambiance was nice, with exception for the tv airing CNN in the front corner; it wasn't obtrusive, but it was there. I did not care for the seating. The tables were close together, and there was a great distance across the table between my date and I, thus at Kaya, you will often be sitting closer to your neighbor than your companion.   Thankful to the date who paid, Heidi",

We started with the Yucatan Hot Bean Dip served with house made chips which was excellent, spicy but with a nice flavor u could actually taste. We had the Tropical Paella as an entree and it was delicious! The portions are big enough to share or take home for leftovers which were even better the next day!

The spices,  flavor and variety are yummy. We had the fish tacos. It is a must try! We also had jerk chicken wings that were simply amazing. My husband had the sweet and spicy ribs and did not like it. It was REALLY sweet. Wait staff was very friendly and prompt. The atmosphere is dark, and very loud. It was also very hot and I'm not sure if they had AC or if it just didn't feel like it with a crowded restaurant. Food price was also reasonable. You're probably looking at $12-20 per person. Menu was also very simple and not more than 30 options (i believe so). Limited choice but a variety.",

Crackling tofu --yummy but pretty spicy and our mouths were burning. The ribs were deliciously sweet, and the Jamaican jerk wings were good. I had the veggie green curry with tiger shrimp. The actual curry was delicious, although I felt the vegetables were overcooked. The rice, however, was disappointingly crunchy! I did like the tuna, and my friends enjoyed the flank steak and the tacos. nothing was spectacular but it was good.   and finally desserts were good. I loved the banana chocolate bread pudding and the chocolate pecan torte was super rich. I'm not a fan of the trend of putting cayenne pepper in sweets, such as the ice cream that came along with the torte. It's always such a surprise and just doesn't work for me. I avoided the ice cream for that reason, but my friends were surprised and didn't like it either.",

This is one of my go-to places to take friends, relatives, and co-workers when they are in town and I have never heard of anyone having a bad meal or cocktail.  The atmosphere makes you forget you are in Pittsburgh and has an awesome Caribbean feel.  The fish tacos are pretty spectacular and are typically my order when I am there; The Don cocktail is also a favorite.  I would also recommend getting the tofu cracklins as an appetizer - I am not a tofu lover, but these are incredible.  You also cannot go wrong with the Kaya burger, conch fritters, or the chicken entree.  The pulled pork quesadilla is pretty spicy, so if you don't like a lot of heat in your food, I would recommend against that.  But overall, you won't be disappointed at Kaya - it's one of the best, and their homemade sorbets/ice creams are a delicious way to end the meal.",

If you've ever had oxtails you know how difficult they can be.  My fiance ordered the fried chicken sandwich. It was good but wasn't that great. He did swap things around so it could of been amazing the original way.   Will definitely visit again!",

I went with another friend and we used our $10 off coupons from the Big Burrito group (if you sign up for their mailing list they mail you coupons at the end of the year to use at any of their restaurants through Jan. 31st).  We started out with the Yucatan hot bean dip which is served with Kaya's house-made chips. Always delicious and never disappoints.  For my meal I ordered the burrito. It was a little spicier than I expected but still very good. Also a very large portion which left me feeling very satisfied at the end of our meal.  Out of all the Big Burrito restaurants, Kaya is at the top of my list with its unique menu items and laid back atmosphere. Great place for a meal with friends/ family or for a date night out. The restaurant itself is not very big so I suggest making a reservation.  It is also in a great location - perfect for strolling through and shopping in the Strip after brunch.  Be sure to check it out sometime.",

    "text": "Illuminated only by the track lighting hanging from the ceiling, the glow of a monitor, and spotlights placed upon the bar, this suave, darkly lit atmosphere screams classy dining with eclectic Caribbean decor. A medium to small sized joint to enjoy dinner and start your Friday bar crawl. Most patrons here are dressed in casual to semi-formal or business attire.   The environment is fairly loud. You have to practically yell to be heard by the person across the table, and people sitting next to each other still had trouble hearing each other. This was mainly the result of the music, although the words and language used in most of the songs were indistinguishable. However, the music was clearly a mix of genres, from hip hop and R'n'B to Reggae, from Latin American pop to soft rock from the 80s. Later, in the night, this music was quite upbeat and made everyone want to dance! This appears to be a calculated move, since when hip hop is played on busier nights, the fast music leads to quicker table turnover.   I ordered the Kaya Juice, a delicious mock tail comprised of mango, guava, cranberry, and pineapple juices. The cranberry juice's bitterness and the muted sweetness of guava temper the overwhelmingly sugary pineapple and mango juices. The conch fritters appeared similar to a pakora, a deep fried and breaded vegetable appetizer featured Indian and Pakistani cuisines. Biting into it yielded a chewy, salty and quite savory taste, made deliciously tangy by lime squeezed on top of it. Underneath the fritters was a green habanero aioli, about as spicy as a teaspoon of Cholula. This was incredibly potent, with a delicious mix of savory ingredients reminiscent of Hispanic Caribbean, potentially Cuban, cuisine.  The entree was a monthly special, the Bake 'n' Shark burger, composed of lettuce, tomato, tamarind, cilantro, hot sauce, and fried bread. The taste was initially tangy, and slightly sweet from the sauce. Unfortunately, the shark part itself was quite underwhelming. Even though the shark patty was breaded and fried, the fish itself tasted extremely bland, like unseasoned tilapia. The mixture of cucumber, crunchy iceberg lettuce, leafy cilantro and other textures added interesting dimension to this otherwise tasteless dish. Its crunchy, possibly fried hamburger bun felt unusual, like an oily cracker. This and was probably the best part of the entire meal. Indeed, the conch fritters probably overshadowed the main course with their flavor and spice. Yet the shark burger's only selling point was its exotic nature.   Overall, it was a great experience! Although I found my entree to be bland, I'm excited to come back and enjoy other plates when the next opportunity arises.",

Definitely start the meal with the Jerked Pork and Plantain Nachos they are incredibly delicious I can still taste them! I got the Tropical Paella and it was out of this world, my date got the Jerked Pulled Pork Quesadilla and she thought it was fantastic, I tried a little and the pork was perfectly cooked! We went on Valentine's Day and didn't have a reservation but thankfully someone canceled and we got to experience this magnificent restaurant! But if it might be a busy night it's a good idea to make a reservation. The entrance is on a backstreet on the strip and the front entrance looks like it should be the back so don't get confused like we did and walk to the other side only to find an alleyway. Haha. The atmosphere of Kaya is super chill and relaxing and the seating is really comfortable! The chips with the mango pineapple tomatillo sauce were delicious, such a unique flavor I've never had before! The food and experience here are like no other this was my first time and I will definitely be back! There wasn't a single moment that I didn't completely enjoy m experience, I would give Kaya a 6 out of 5 stars if I could! Hope this helps, enjoy!",

Sweet potato fries mmm Highlight of brunch: first of, mimosa is way overpriced. C'mmon it's brunch!! Ain't nobody tryna spend $30 on three small glasses of mimosa. Lol.

If you're thinking of coming here, stop thinking, go give it a try ;)",

They had the correct large cube of ice for my husband's Jameson rocks, and my Dark and Stormy was the perfect complement to the tropical flavors of the meal. Husband loved his tropical paella. I had the chicken tuna poke bowl - a poke bowl served in a bowl made from a fried chicken breast. The poke was so good, I barely touched the chicken \"bowl,\" but did try some of it and it was very good friend chicken. Our friend was able to have her blackened salmon dish served non-blackened so it wouldn't be too spicy for her liking, and she said it was excellent. Would definitely be regulars here if we lived here.",

We got our drinks (water) in a reasonable amount of time, and we're waiting for the waitress to take our food order. We waited for about 25 minutes before we received any attention from her. We decided to get up to leave. As we got up, she cams to our table finally and said \"are you guys leaving or what?\" Needless to say, we left. I do not have an opinion to give on the food, since we did not get to taste anything. Based on the service alone, I would recommend to skip out on this place.",

The cornbread was crunchy, seasoned and delicious. I usually don't like runny eggs but they tasted great with everything else on my plate. Hubby ordered the rainbow salad and that was amazing. The size was generous and it included papaya chunks, mango slices, chickpeas, pickled pink onion, crunchy shallots on top, avocado and more! It really did look like a tropical rainbow and there wasn't any cheese, croutons or heavy dressing to ruin it. We finished everything super quickly. The prices are high here.  We went on a Sunday and stopped unexpectedly for brunch without any expectations. I will say it's actually a bigger place than most other restaurants in the Strip District. The owner had to move us to another table and there was a change and delay in being served but for the trouble, she offered us a free drink on the menu. I had the lime grapefruit margarita and it was so strong! Presentation was beautiful but I could not finish it ;).  The only downside was the slowness of our server. Since we changed tables, we had to wait an additional 8-10 min for someone to notice us and assign us a new server. Other than that, they were friendly enough. I would definitely come back to try their weekday menu!",

Kaya gets it right.   Service is good. Seating is a little cramped when it's busy. You are close enough to easily steal food off of your neighboring tables plates.   Nice beer selection probably 20 on tap. Not much crap. Nice strong drinks.   My only caution would be if your going with a group make sure they have open minds. I made the mistake of going with a group of our culinary people and I guess I gave them too much credit. The menu is Afro-Caribbean so if your people are looking for familiarity go elsewhere.",

Letting us know that the kitchen was backed up and when to expect the food etc. also when we got the food it was fantastic. I got the crocodile appetizer and for my meal the Cuban  sandwich. All very good. We also shared the hot bean dip and everyone else enjoyed their meals. I would of given this place a lower score if they food had not been so good when it did come out. Also since the weather was nice it was a great night to sit outside. Only issue was the bad river/shit smell that blew past every now and then but it did not ruin the experience.",

We started with some Kaya chips and Yucatan Hot Bean Dip, then some fried chicken tacos. The chips were a treat and the bean dip was almost like chili, which I enjoyed. It had a spicy kick, but I didn't think it was that hot. The fried chicken tacos were absolutely delicious.  I ordered the Kaya Burger for my meal and was pleasantly surprised with it. The egg made for a great burger and the Kaya sauce was extremely tasty. I expected the avacado and bacon to stand out, but there was a blend of flavors instead, which was great. I was surprised by how small the burger looked when I got it, the the burger patty was very thick and I was stuffed when I finished. I was also able to try some jerked chicken from a colleague's plate and it was exquisite. Not only was the flavor out of this world, it was very juicy.",

    "text": "I've always enjoyed dining at Kaya. Most recently, I went for dinner with two of my close friends. We had and I suggest making a reservation, even if you're planning on dining during the week. It was quite busy for a Thursday at 7pm.   Upon arrival, we were promptly seated toward the back of the restaurant. Our sever, Autumn, greeted us and gave us ample time to review the drink and food menu.  In addition to a fun selection of cocktails, they also have a large wine menu. We each ordered a glass of wine ($10).  We decided to order an appetizer and chose the calamari. I always like calamari, but I always think it tastes the same. Which leads me to ask, why do I order it? Anyway, instead of a traditional marinara on the side, they served theirs with a yummy, green sauce. Slightly spicy tangy, but delicious. The calamari wasn't super greasy (a plus).  For our entrees, I ordered the fish tacos (grilled, not crispy) ($18), and the other two ordered the fried chicken special ($18) and a fancy burger (can't remember exactly what made it so special). The tacos, something I've had many times before are just wonderful. The kitchen doesn't skimp here, packing each with a nice portion of fish, coleslaw and dressing. The fried chicken platter looked amazing. Keep in mind that they only serve the fried chicken on Thursday nights (perhaps that's why it was so busy?). My friend noted that the chicken was super delicious (it looked it!).  We didn't stick around for dessert because we were so full.  All in all, a really great night at a fun restaurant in Pittsburgh's Strip District.",

They gave us a lot of food, and it was good.  the chicken adobe was a little salty, but the food was quite good.  The waiter and chef were friendly.  The waiter did a good job.  It was pricey.  35 dollars a person.  They did not put the price on the menu.  I believe they should, as sometimes you feel funny having to ask the cost. Speaking of asking, our party of five consisted of two couples, and a single.  They gave us one check.  I do not understand why restaurants are not more thoughtful in this regard.  It is as if their attitude is \"well, if they ask, we can split the checks, but if they don't ask, why should we make more work for us?\"  All I know is that if I owned a restaurant, I am going to do all things big and small to make it as pleasurable an experience as possible.  Everything counts! But the biggest thing was that the chef (congenial as he was) had an unkempt beard that was sort of dangling over our food.  I know how today's society is, but that is not right.  As of now, I am not going back.  But if they make two simple changes (automatically ask the party how they want the checks done and have any chefs shave a long beard (small beard is ok), I will go back.  One other positive.  I see the manager, or whoever it is, responds to some of these reviews in an attempt to right some wrongs..  I think that is the right idea.",

Their red sangria is delicious and always my first drink! They also have a nice list of beers.  The space is small and I recommend making reservations if going for dinner.  Some of my favorite starters are the Kaya chips with mango salsa-this salsa is so delicious and the tofu cracklings- lettuce wraps with tofu and the Chipotle BBQ sauce adds a great flavor.

    "text": "This by far is one of my top 3 restaurants in Pittsburgh.  The happy hour is amazing-half off of almost all drinks.  This means great bold and oaky reds for a decent price.  I think the Yukatan Bean dip is also amazing!!  They use root chips instead of tortilla chips that Mad Mex uses and it is so much better that way!  I also enjoy their vegetarian options and their vegetarian-friendly days now and then.  I also went for brunch recently during Open Streets Pittsburgh and I think I had the best breakfast burrito that I've ever had. The bartenders are extremely friendly and never leave you sitting too long with an empty glass.  The only downside of this place is that it is small, I wish the space was bigger and their outdoor seating had a better set-up.",

I ordered the Grapefruit Basil Margarita and SC the Poco Picante. The drinks had great flavor and according to SC, his was \"the best drink I've ever had.\"  Food wise we got the Jamaican Green Curry Vegetables and Jerk Pulled Pork Quesadilla. There was a lot of great flavor in the curry and I love the fresh pineapple to offset the (a little too spicy for me) curry, all the veggies and the rice. It was comfort in a bowl!  The service was also very friendly and attentive. I also liked the decor of the restaurant. Would definitely come by again next time we're in town!",

We got a table right away around 6 pm on a Friday, even though the bar was packed.  Our server was able to get us in on time for the last few minutes of happy hour where cocktails are half price. I enjoyed the Redrum's presentation with the single large ice cube and fig, but it ended up being extremely bold (given The Shining reference). Our server saw me struggling and still gave me half off the Red Stripe I ordered in its place. They comped the first one right away without me even requesting it!  I'm also amazed at how well they can do a spicy fried chicken sandwich and waffle fries without hinging entirely on salt and extra grease. The breading on the sandwich was light, which made it less cumbersome to eat and the waffle fries were topped with actual seasoning instead of extra breading in its place. The chicken was extremely savory and the honey mustard on top tied it together with some sweetness.",

    "text": "A takeout visit for te Cuban Sandwich, Jerked pork and Plantain nachos. Overall, the Cuban sandwich was absolutely phenomenal! However, the plantain nachos tasted as though they accidentally dropped their entire spice rack into the jerked pork.  Cuban sandwich: a sumptuous mix of different kinds of well-seasoned meats melded together with creamy cheese and savory aioli. Although the sandwich was a bit heavy, it was incredibly delicious, and I look forward to tasting other sandwiches they have to offer.  Jerked pork and plantain chips: the plantain chips by themselves were crispy, well-salted and delicious. However, as I mentioned above, my taste buds felt that they were on a roller coaster ride of different spices, some of which may have gone well, but others that made me wonder \"I think something happened in the kitchen, and it involves someone experimenting with every spice he has in his spice rack\". I personally would not recommend this dish.  Overall, the receptionist was welcoming, servers were kind and patient with our orders, and wait for take-out was not long at all.  The Cuban was a solid 4.5, the Plantain nachos a 1.5, service 4, ambiance 4.",

Ordered the LOCO MOCO ($11) off of their July Featured Island Cuisine (Hawaii), which I think might've been a mistake. My friends thought it was good but I thought it tasted way too peppery?! It contained pineapples, hamburger steak, coconut rice, onion gravy, scallions, Fresnos, and cilantro. If you've had bibimbap before, it was basically a Hawaiian bibimbap.  But it was just a blend of flavors that just didn't taste THAT good together. For my drink, I ordered their WHITE SANGRIA, it was alright, maybe should have tried their regular sangria instead. Oh yeah, do not get their TAKO POKE bowl, holy moly that thing was small and I felt bad for my friend who got it, especially for $14.  Customer service. Slow. But then they would fill the waters too often, and when they brought the food to us, the way the servers talked to each other was so.. weird?? They gave each other some attitude and I felt a little uncomfortable sitting there. It was also my birthday and they didn't refrigerate the cake my friends brought. (NO CAKE FEE if you were wondering! Not sure if you wanna bring your cake though, hopefully it doesn't melt..) When we got our checks, the customer copy was on top when we were paying (what?). Well. At least they lit the candle we provided for our room-temp cake, lol.   I read an old review where it said they used to charge if you wanted to make a reservation, which wasn't True in our case so don't worry about that.  For a big Burrito Restaurant Group place, I'm pretty disappointed. Not really around my price point for a college student. I signed up for their emails awhile ago but didn't get a free meal to use that day but oh well. Someone would have to really try to convince me to come here again.",

Drinks came out soon, as well as a pitcher of water for our table of four.   As for our food, we'd ordered the spicy ahi Tina poke, the salmon poke, the loco moco, and the Rueben sandwich. All of these things took almost 50 minutes to come out to our table. Two of those are raw fish bowls, and the others didn't seem that hard. I don't know what was going on there.  Our server apologized for the kitchen delay.   The spicy ahi tuna poke was very good. I liked it better than the salmon poke, which had nuts in it. The loco moco was really good too.

    "text": "Stopped in for a Saturday afternoon Linner and were pleasantly surprised. Kaya has a welcoming interior with a well stocked Bar and almost communal style seating on the opposite wall, not sure if cozy would be a good descriptor but you should definitely have no expectations of even minimal privacy. This is not a bad thing but be advised you probably won't be having any intimate conversations with your date during peak hours, or maybe you will if you don't mind who hears.  From the time we walked in the door to walking out of it the service staff was gracious, understood the menu, thorough with our orders, and attentive but not overbearing which allowed us time to relax and enjoy our experience.   First up for us was the drinks, I had the \"Room 237\" and my wife imbibed with a \"Still Singing Galway Bay\", both were made with top shelf liquor and tasted refreshing. Neither were short in the spirits  and well proportioned for a pre dinner drink along side the Conch Fritter appetizer.  Our main event plates included the Shrimp Po'Boy highlighted with cilantro - jalapeno remoulade that made it interesting enough to order. Our second plate was the Tropical Paella made up of sofrito, chicken, chorizo, shrimp, scallops, mussels, pineapple, and red peppers. Since we usually share our plates this was a good tasting combo for both of us. The flavor and texture combinations made for a delicious meal leaving us both satisfied and full.  All in all it was a good hour and a half late lunch where we weren't rushed and just took some time to enjoy the experience. We'll be back to try their Fried Chicken Thursday the next time we're down in the Strip District. Make sure to check out their web site for menu offerings as they do change between lunch and dinner.",

Luckily, we were able to convince our friendly neighbors to scoot over a few spaces such that my family of 4 could fit.  We started off with the Kaya juice which is a combination of 4 fruit juices (mango, guava, pineapple, and grapefruit - I think). Drink wasn't too sweet and was very refreshing on such a humid night.  For appetizers, we opted for the Yucatan hot bean dip and the cheese/corn fritters. The fritters were just okay...presented more like cheese sticks than fritters. The chipotle sauce that accompanied them though was good. As for the bean dip - order this! The bean dip is hot and gooey from the melted cheese served with a hearty side of house made chips. Some pieces were definitely overdone, but most were seasoned well and not too well done. Actually, it was a pretty divine bite when you combined the bean dip and the chipotle sauce...yum!  For entrees, we ordered from the more 'casual' menu but I was surprised at the portion sizes!   My fish tacos were huge! The tacos featured creamy guac, approximately 2 filets of crispy fish per tacos, and a hearty topping of slaw. The slaw was just okay in my opinion...had a hint of ginger which didn't pair especially well with cilantro and limes. Mom opted for the flank steak sandwich. GET. THIS. The steak was sooo tender and had the right balance of flavors. The waffle fries were a bit too salty though. Brother opted for the pulled pork quesadilla but found it to be too pork heavy and severely lacking in cheese or other toppings. His sweet potato fries were on point though. Dad ordered the regular cubano and enjoyed it.",

The Jamaican Jerk wings app we ordered was good, but I've had much better wings at a dive bar. The flavor on point, the texture just didn't do it for me. I like my wings to be crispy and tender. These were tough and chewy at times.  My friend got the salmon. He said it was over cooked on the outside and too soft on the inside.  I ordered the rainbow salad, it  was good and not a bad value. I opted for no meat because I had the chicken wings already. Im leaving 4 starts for my overall experience, but there is definitely room for improvement. I'd give it another try and you should too.

Well here for her funeral, we visited Kaya in the Strip district, and 8 minutes from the apartment we rented. It was great!  Service - Great. Our server had a hippie, ladi-back, guru vibe. He provided good guidance on must try menu options, and he wasn't wrong.  Drink - I had a Tropic Thunder. A delightful (not too sweet) lime, mint, cucumber and vodka libation that was refreshing.  Starter - Tropical Guacamole. Pineapples and avocado. What's not to love!  Entree - Flank Steak Stir Fry was amazing! A nice blend of ginger, coconut milk, hoisin sauce and El Yacateco habanero sauce mixed with flank steak, bell peppers and long beans [Note: Entrees are quite large. You should consider sharing, otherwise make sure you have room in your fridge for leftovers.]  If you are ever in Pittsburgh, PA I recommend you stop by Kaya. We just might go again on this trip.",

The margarita was like any other margarita, except they charged me $12 for it.  I sat on the patio because it was a nice day. The service was fine and the restaurant seemed clean enough.   Overall I don't have much to say about it. It was a bland experience and I don't recommend it.",

    "text": "More like 4 1/2 stars...not quite 5 because our food took a long time to get to us.   A friend I drove in to Pittsburgh to support our friend who was showing as a part of NCECA. After that long drive and checking out some amazing artwork throughout the city, all while avoiding drunken green people (we were there on St. Patrick's Day), we were in need of some good food. And we purposely avoided all bars/restaurants where we saw green people hanging out at.   One of the artists familiar with the area suggested we head over to Smallman Street, where we would have some options. There just happened to be another exhibit near by so it was a win.   There's a fully stocked bar, booths, and tables in towards the back. Restrooms are downstairs...I didn't really explore to see what else was downstairs. Anyways, our server was great. He was able to answer any questions we had about the menu and very nice.   I forgot what was ordered...I think one of my friends had a pulled pork quesadilla thing sans tortilla. It came with a side salad that looked amazing and some sweet potato fries. It was highly enjoyed. My other friend had ordered some broccoli cheddar soup (also highly enjoyed) and the vegetarian burger (not highly enjoyed, but finished). They admittedly don't make the patty in-house, and that may have made the difference. You can tell that everything else on their menu is made in-house however. It may be the reason why our food took so long to come out.   I ordered the jerk chicken salad. While it wasn't what I thought it would be (it came with tortillas and not a lot of greens), it was absolutely delicious. It had some mango, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc. And surprisingly was even good wrapped inside those tortillas. Not for the faint of heart...I am someone who can take the heat, and this definitely had it. I basically licked the plate clean and could've probably had more. It was absolutely delicious.   I would love to go back when/if I'm ever back in Pittsburgh. If you're around, check it out.",

The food is quite different from the typical types of cuisines you'll find in the greater Pittsburgh area, so for that reason alone, I would recommend checking out Kaya at least once. I thought the food was pretty good, but nothing worth writing home about. The ambiance was towards the \"fancy\" side, and the prices mostly reflected that. Probably wouldn't specifically make plans to go back, but I wouldn't mind joining if some friends decided to go here for dinner.",

We decided on Kaya after finding out about their great happy hour. And oh my is it great! All single serve alcoholic beverages are half off from 4:30-6:30. That includes cocktails and even spirits. My husband got an $18 glass or Blanton's for $9! I had (multiple) grapefruit basil margaritas. I loved it!   Our server was wonderful. She had lots of food and drink suggestions. I ordered the fish tacos after she mentioned they were their most popular menu item. My husband had the steak sandwich...I can't remember the name of it but he loved it. The fish tacos were the best fish tacos I've had. The sauce and slaw on them are so flavorful. I was full after eating two but ate all three because they were delicious.  If you're looking to have a nice night out I recommend coming here! Even if you're just looking for a good happy hour, the drinks are priced so well you can definitely get a small plate or two. We will certainly be back soon.",

While we weren't ready to order immediately (first visit), our server seemed very friendly and relaxed/ready to go.  But once we ordered, everything took way too long.  Our drink order took 5-10 minutes, and when we placed our full order (apps and entrees with a rush on sweet potato fries), everything showed up around 25 minutes later (our entrees came out 2-3 minutes after the apps).  I told the server countless times to bring out a side order of sweet potato fries as my kid was melting down and she kept saying they ran out and were making more; meanwhile said kiddo was pointing out all the fries every other table was receiving as everyone around us received their food.  I also asked if the kitchen was in the weeds (I don't want to blame the service unnecessarily) and she said \"no\" and looked at me like I was crazy.  Service was absolutely pitiful (yes, I served tables back in the day, so I know bad service).  Ultimately, although their food was absolutely fantastic, they are too dysfunctional as a kitchen and wait staff for me to risk bringing my family back there again.  I truly love Casbah and Mad Mex, but this restaurant just hasn't figured out how to make people comfortable.  I really hate writing such a harsh review about a restaurant with such wonderful food, but from a family stand point, I am definitely not their target customer, and that is a-ok, I just know I won't be back for a long time.  Side Note: the bar tenders are great!  When the service hit rock bottom I bussed most my dishes to them, asked for extra silverware, drinks, etc, and they were very cool.",

However; the bowl of strawberry/red pepper gazpacho was the best thing we ate today.   Maybe its hit or miss here but, for me... it's been more MISS. Ill take my business elsewhere... OH and FYI Kaya is part of the Big Burrito restaurant food chain which encompasses my FAVORITE place  MAD MEX !!!  Just not sure why Kaya is so inferior.  So I guess it does not matter if I wont come back to Kaya because Ill still go to Mad Mex every chance I get; ether way, Big Burrito gets my cash.",

I've only nibbled on a couple appetizers - Conch fritters were tasty and the black bean dip was not too bad either.  However their drinks... I have a favorite.  I've tried the Graduate which is sage liquor, limoncello, lemon, sparkling wine.  It's very fresh but a tad bit sweet.  I asked my bartender his favorite and he said the Pisco Sour - Barsol Pisco, lime, egg white*, Angostura bitters.  Frothy yet tart - I love it!  We have a winner :)  If you're looking for a great happy hour venue, try Kaya and have a Pisco Sour.  I'll be there too, so say hello!",

My friend and I stopped in after shopping for groceries  in the Strip. We were seated immediately in a spot with plenty of room to place our grocery bags next to us. Our waitress was friendly & gave excellent recommendations for drinks. We started with a bloody mary and grapefruit margarita. I got the horseradish infused vodka in my first bloody mary and the old bay infused vodka in my second. Both were the perfect kick but the horseradish had a stronger flavor. Our app was the mango pineapple gaucemole. The mango overpowered the pineapple but not the avocado! I would order that dip again. I stuck with Bloody marys throughout our meal and my friend switched to a mojito. It was crisp, fresh and well blended.  For our entrees, I got the Jamaican veggie curry and my friend got the flank steak burger with arugula and truffle aioli and a side salad. Wow! Both dishes were incredible!!! The citrus that pulled through my curry was a delightful surprise and the portion was huge. It was served with saffron rice and I had to leave most of the rice behind. My friend demolished the burger in record time. The aioli was the perfect compliment. I am not a burger fan but one bite of her dish, I saw the appeal.  The attentive service, excellent food and drinks screamed 5 star. I am excited for my next trip back to further explore the menu and libation creations!",

You receive 10 wings in the order for $10, which is probably one of the better values on their menu.    For my entree I ordered the tropical Paella.  My girlfriend ordered the grilled flank steak.  Both portions were plentiful and delicious.  The only reason why I am knocking the rating down to a 4 is because our waiter gave us bowls and plates on the side and they weren't completely clean.

Taco Tuesday is a phuckin joke those little ass tacos are 4 dollars and misleading AF matter of fact that will take the rating back to 2 stars. After eating, felt like  I should have gotten a diff dish. Will be waiting for the Kaya Veg burger then I may come back so now we're back at 3 stars. We also had the jerk wings which were barely jerk (poor seasoning) and 1star and poor grade of chicken back to 2 stars. I'm willing to let them redeem there self. Service was cool and swift which is saving this review. But I'm just a foodie and know food and good dishes so the average person may like it but I wasn't impressed to say the least.",

I got the pulled pork quesodilla and the quesodilla was like dripping wet from the pork or something I don't know. You couldn't pick it up and eat it like a normal quesodilla you had to eat it with a fork which was annoying. It just was falling apart when I was trying to eat it and not it a good way lol. I wouldn't really recommend this place or go back it wasn't that great there's way better places to eat in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner as I've had this place on my to-go places for a while, but never really got a chance to follow up with it until recently and sat down at a bar seat to see what to get. The menu is pretty decently sized and judging from the crowds and the buzz when I walked in, I'd say this is probably one of the more popular restaurants in the Strip District as it's also on the cheaper side as well for decently sized portions. Anyways, ended up ordering the Ahi Tuna Poke Bowl and the Jamaican Green Curry Vegetables entree. As for the poke bowl, it was decent tasting. Ingredients were fresh and tasty, although probably not really worth the $14 I paid as I've had better poke bowls elsewhere for less (and also made-to-order aka I could customize it however I liked). Now as for the Jamaican Green Curry Vegetable ... mmm did this entree really blow my mouth out of the park. Now I will say it's not as spicy as Indian or Asian style curries, but I will say that the spices (mid-spicy), the pineapple (sweet), along with the carbs in the dish (potatoes, saffron rice) and the veggies (peas, greens, mushroom, squash) made for a delightful medley of different flavors in my mouth ... made it so happy haha. I would say the curry itself is actually pretty darn good and was reasonably price as the portion size was rather large for what I paid (my appetite has really declined in comparison to previous years ... prob a good thing). In general? Great place to come and get some great tasting grub. Bar here is also pretty lively and there are many drinks that you can order. I would not recommend coming here if you're planning a date or more intimate gathering though ... place is rather loud with the crowds and all, but for good reason! It's certainly worth paying a visit to come try this place, the great food, and the drinks (if you're into that kind of stuff haha)!",

It was loaded with yummy sauce, avocado and an egg - so much flavor and the sesame bun was such a great addition. I've heard the regular Kaya burger is amazing too. This place gets pretty packed at most times of day and has a GREAT happy hour (almost everything was half off), but it's not a huge location so it gets crowded!

Finally we got to try it out Sunday for brunch:)  I have never had paella before and I was happy to see they had a tropical paella with chicken, shrimp, chorizo, mussel and rice. I am not a fan of mussel so I told the waiter to leave them out so it doesn't go to waste. My mom ordered the black bean, shrimp and jalapeno omelet  but requested just the shrimp and cheese be left in it. The table beside us received their food and it wasn't long before two of the three sent their dishes back. Our plates came out and my moms came out with jalapenos and black beans, so her dish went back to the kitchen to be fixed. The manager was very apologetic and took the omelet off the bill. When mine came out, scallops were mixed in with the paella and I am also not a fan of scallops. I didn't say anything, I just picked around them, but it would have been helpful to know that these were included in the paella as well. I did feel bad wasting them, but I will say that the paella was bursting with flavor. It's a bit on the spicy side, but it was not lacking in the flavor department that's for sure. I would recommend this True Caribbean dish! All in all, the kitchen may have been having an off day since certain peoples dishes didn't come out as requested; I would still come back to try other menu items!",

Service was good.  What disappointed me was something so simple to get right--the guacamole.  Yep, that's right. The guac.  And I get that Kaya isn't a Mexican restaurant, but I think that means if you're going to put guacamole on your appetizer list, it better be on point.  It did have a lot of tropical ingredients mixed in, but it didn't have enough salt or acidity, and the chips were rather bland as well.  The jerk chicken wings with the cilantro cream sauce, on the other hand?  BANGIN'.  I'm definitely willing to go back and give them another try.",

The waffle fries were so delicious. Really crisp, could tell they made them on the spot and were not frozen & heated up. The flank steak cemita was delicious. I usually don't eat steak, and the steak was cooked amazingly. It wasn't too medium or well done, and it had a lot of flavor. They put a good layer of lettuce and tomato. I hate places that skimp! Finally I got a angry orchard cider. They poured it into a cute little glass. Really exceptional service, beautiful decor, and great food. Makes the pricier tag worth it. My food cost $25 with tax",

Last time I was there the chicken was awesome, but the cole slaw was unpleasant with kind of a weird taste to it. There are enough really great things there to keep me coming back but I find myself needing to keep track of which things they do well and which should be skipped. (No slaw, I'll have a salad instead). I also get irked at some underhanded things I've run into such as ordering a drink during happy hour but being charged full price for it, and then getting an explanation \"you ordered dinner, and we charge full price for a drink if you have it with dinner.\" But of course that doesn't appear on any sign or the menu, I guess you're supposed to read their minds before ordering.",

My hubz just became a vegetarian so I am always on the look out for restaurants that serves delicious meals for carnivores (such as I) and vegetarians.   Decor: First, I must review on the decor. I mean the interior design just makes me to think of an art space. The paintings on the walls, the furnitures, even the bathroom, was decorated nicely.   Service: Lol... I felt like a food critic as they served our meals one by one. We did ended up sitting at the bar as you had to make reservations the night we came so there were not a lot of space to place all the food I ordered lol. I didn't have any issues though.   Food: (I'm salivating...) We first got the Yucatan Hot Bean Dip. Delicious! I especially loved the fresh house-made chips. We also had the Tofu wrap! My hubz looooved it! He kept wanting to go back here for the tofu wrap during our time in Pittsburgh! The tofu was just nice and firm, sweet, and spicy all at the same time. We also tried the corn and lentil beignets. For me, it just tasted like flour with corn and lentils lol. For my entree, I had the Flank Steak Cemita! Definitely a must!!! I enjoyed every bite! The avocado, black bean with the chipotle aoili was just plain delicious! My husband ordered the Jamaican Green Curry Vegetables. I did have two to three bites. It just tasted minty cool and spicy. I wasn't impressed.   Overall, I wanna come back and try more dishes from their menu!",

I want to give a shout out to who's ever in charge of the music in this place it was great had us moving in our seats! We ordered the mango salsa and chips which was tasty.

I ordered the conch fritters (and soup) and my boyfriend order the ribs for appetizer and salmon entree.  My conch fritters had such a crunch that the sauce provided was hardly sufficient for one fritter.  My food was so overcooked that the person next to me (not in my party) who also ordered conch fritters couldn't help but tell me he was in the same boat!  His food also was overcooked.  When my boyfriend's ribs were overcooked, I really urged him to return them to the kitchen.  However, he was reluctant out of fear that his food might be spat in.  I really wanted to impress my boyfriend for his birthday, but sadly it just wasn't possible with the look of disappointment he just couldn't hide.  I really had high hopes for this visit because I had a great one about a year ago.  But sadly something has changed.  Someone reached out to me to \"remedy the situation\" but never did.  I can assure you this is a place of False promises.  I wouldn't trust them for decent food or good service.",

    "text": "Kaya is one of those restaurants that's been on my radar forever.  I finally received the chance to try it out yesterday (Sun.) for brunch at 1pm with a friend.  Given that I was taking her out for my birthday, that she'd taken me out for brunch at Marty's Market, and that I had a $10 off coupon, Kaya seemed like a natural choice.  As an added bonus, it's GF friendly (my friend is a GF eater), which is a rarity for brunch.  We started off by ordering the chips and guac ($8).  While a bit pricey, the guac was clearly freshly made, containing chunks of pineapple and mango in addition to avocado.  The flavor was good, though not as limey as other versions I've had--likely to avoid overpowering the flavors of the other tropical fruits.  In addition to the appetizer, my friend ordered a Bloody Mary with Old Bay vodka ($11).  Unfortunately, she didn't end up drinking much of it due to it being too spicy for her taste.  If the bartender noticed, she didn't say anything, which was kind of a bummer, since it wasn't exactly cheap.  For our entrees, I ordered the Caribbean eggs Benedict ($12), and my friend ordered the huevos rancheros ($10).  This version of eggs Benedict substituted cornbread for the English muffin and pulled pork for Canadian bacon, with the usual poached eggs on top.  While I enjoyed this take on the dish, I must confess that I missed the Hollandaise sauce, which is my favorite component of traditional eggs Benedict (I make a mean one myself!).  Having said that, the pulled pork and cornbread combination was quite flavorful, and the runniness (sp?) of the egg yolk mimicked the consistency of Hollandaise.  Though I didn't try my friend's huevos rancheros, she enjoyed them, and the bacon accompanying it looked absolutely delicious.  Both of our dishes came with sides of grilled pineapple and potato hash.  While the grilled pineapple was flavorful and moist but firm, complementing my eggs Benedict nicely, the hash was rather dry and flavorless, and I was not a fan of the onions and peppers mixed in.  Personally, I'd have preferred plain old home fries--but then again, I suppose that would be too pedestrian for the likes of an upscale-ish brunch at Kaya.  Overall, my friend and I enjoyed our brunch at Kaya, despite some items not being exactly suited to our personal tastes.  Because we weren't able to get a reservation, we sat at the bar, which may explain why service wasn't quite up to par.  Despite what I'd thought from passing by, Kaya actually isn't *that* big--though there is a decent amount of seating, and the bar itself is quite large.  I look forward to returning for happy hour on a Thurs. to take advantage of half price drinks and fried chicken night!",

    "text": "We went to Kaya last Saturday for a late dinner.  I set up our reservations online and being a Saturday 8:45 was the earliest unless we wanted to eat with the early birds at 5pm.  I really like the convenience of scheduling reservations online.  When we arrived at the restaurant it wasn't overly busy.  There were a few open tables and a few open spots at the bar.  The Pens game was on, but the one TV I saw was too far away from the table to see.  That's ok, I was really looking forward to this place so concentrating on my meal seemed to trump my attention to the game...    Well I knew already I wanted to try the wings, and they didn't disappoint.  I absolutely loved the cilantro sauce they were served with. It really heightened the wings to a more sophisticated flavor.  I wanted to ask for extra sauce but we actually ended up finishing them before our waitress returned.  Recommend the wings.  Now as far as the entree went I really, really wanted to get the fish tacos.  I love a good fish taco and everyone talks highly of Kaya's so I was sure I couldn't go wrong.  However, my H talked me out of getting the tacos and trying something \"new.\"  As he put it \"you know what fish tacos are like, try something else.\"  So I did, and I can confidently say I was really, really disappointed to say the least.  I got the tropical Paella that had chicken, chorizo, mussels, scallops, shrimp, some pineapple flavor with peas and crushed red pepper.  Ugh I thought this would be delicious considering I am a seafood junkie and it just missed the mark completely.  The chicken and chorizo were totally overcooked and the rice resembled the flavor and texture of Rice A Roni, yes it was that bad and bland.  I found no scallops and there was no sauce to the dish to soak the mussels in meaning dry, dry, dry.  The only part of it that was tasty was the shrimp.  I am guessing they cook up the paella in advance for dinner then reheat it and add fresh shrimp?  Well that was how it tasted... So get this, my H who talked me out of ordering the fish tacos, ordered them for himself, a move I was not anticipating.  A few bites into my dinner and I just said to him, I really don't like this at all.  He offered to swap dinners with me so I had almost 2 whole tacos, and yes folks they were delicious, and way to take one for the team dear!  I knew I should have just went with my gut and got the tacos from the get go.  As for the rest of the Paella he did eat it but grudgingly and had the same opinions about it as I had, not good and definitely not worth $24.00.    So cool place, good drinks, pleasant atmosphere, attentive servers, but I would never recommend the Paella.  The fish tacos, YES, the paella, NO...",

At first we couldn't tell if he was sarcastic and joking but after multiple interactions, realized the waiter was being extremely rude.

I had some folks in town and decided to adventure the Strip District.   I picked the wrong time (after 6pm).    I quickly accessed my Yelp 911 app on my phone and found Kaya a few steps away.  We walked in and were met by the Hostess.  She explained the place was completely booked for the evening with reservations.   She did mention we could eat at the bar.   There were just enough spots for our group.  I knew this was going to be a long night so I was wearling my big boy pants and was ready for some festivities.   I ordered our group some drinks and appetizers.     I am used to beer and wine flights.   Kaya offers Rum flights.    I boarded this pupply and went on the smokey flight while my friends went on the sweet and traditional flight.   We had a great pairing of appetizers (corn and lentil beignets, mango salsa, and calamari).  The dinner  - I ordered the Flank Steak (recommended by the bartender).   It was marinated for 2 days!  The steak was very tender and the meal was awesome.  Atmosphere:   Very trendy with lots of people.   Awesome atmosphere Price;  Price can run you for an entree anywhere from $15-25 on average Food:  Great , wow, yummy ...  I strongly recommend this place.  I hope you like it as much as I did.  (Please note that this owned by a restaurant group (Big Burrito) who own Eleven, Casbah, etc...)",

This is sort of a 'Friday night tradition' normally with my wife and I when she flies into town. I always get the tofu tacos;however, it seems that the tofu tacos one on the menu today. I hope that's not a permanent thing!   Sat outside with my friend Rick tonight. Had the fantastic ox tail bruschetta followed by the skirt steak on a bed of asparagus and polenta.  They serve nonalcoholic beer, which makes me very happy. I wish more restaurants did that! Oh, and by the way, I do not think O'Doule's qualifies as anything other than rotgut, so if that's what you serve, you're not serving nonalcoholic beer.  They screwed steak tonight was okay, but a little bland. I was able to put some hot sauce on it to make up for it.  Service is good, location is good, highly recommend.",

The burger was well cooked, but the toppings make it, especially the chihuahua cheese, egg, and special sauce. The waffle fries served with the burger were crisp and well-seasoned, and I only wish it came with more of them. The mixed drinks were excellent as well. My significant other's Tropic Thunder was one of the most unique cocktails I've ever tasted - cool cucumber lead with a sour pineapple finish. My Caipirinha was great as well, but a little underwhelming compared to the other, and I wish they added actual lime wedges like a traditional one.   Pros -great happy hour (4:30 - 6:30, half price drinks) -some of the best mixed drinks I've ever had  Cons -parking can be kind of tough, but hey, it's the strip  -sat at the bar, and the bartenders splashed water over the bar as they were cleaning cocktail shakers",

It may be me but the pineapple messed up my taste buds so it must've had some of the pineapple core in it too. The chips could also use some salt. I loves the waffle fries. They were fantastic just like mad mex's fries. I ordered the Tempura Avocado taco which was good but would've been better with extra sauce (and salt again maybe me).

Service was really slow despite the fact that our reservation was after 8 pm. Once we were seated, we spent way too much time waiting for our server to greet us. We didn't even get a glass of water. We ordered right away, but it took almost 45 minutes to receive our entrees and our hot appetizer. Thank god we placed an order for guacamole, which was the only part of our meal that arrived quickly.  The food: tropical guac was a fresh twist on the classic, studded with fruit instead of tomato and onion. Lightly spicy!   The lentil and corn beignets were a little too oily, but the flavors were spot-on (spiced, gingery, crispy). They were more of a fritter than a beignet.   Banh mi fried avocado tacos were unique and flavorful. But absolutely COVERED whole stems of cilantro. Beautiful presentation, but extremely hard to eat.   Jamaican jerk chicken was tender and flavorful, but the skin on my chicken was completely blackened. The lighting in the restaurant is dim so when I bit into my chicken, I got an unexpected mouthful of char. The drumstick was also so charred it was inedible. This dish was also covered in whole cilantro stems. I love cilantro, but why? Not every dish needs this much!   The Jamaican curry vegetables were practically a puree of cilantro and hot chilis. Our family eats spicy food but this just hot... flavor and texture was a fail. Rice was served *in* the curry... so it's all soggy by the time it arrives.   No indication of spice levels are given on the menu, but of our items were strewn with sliced spicy Fresno and jalapeno peppers. If you can't handle the heat, you might want go ask the kitchen to hold the .   One good thing I can say, portions are generous. And the flavor profiles are inventive for Pittsburgh. I'd try again but not on a busy night",

    "text": "Kaya is great.  There's big variety in the menu, including some vegetarian dishes.  In addition to the great food, this is a great, casual place that takes reservations, so if you have a special occasion and want to do lunch in the Strip, you won't have to wait for a table.  Here's my take:  - Bean dip app is nice - served hot, with some cheese on top and fresh green onions, it's tasty and the portion is definitely large enough to share.   - I like the Cuban Sandwich, made with a proper sandwich press, so it's warm and just a little crisp on the outside. Kaya's version has some turkey in it.  Oddly, the pickles (a standard Cuban sammy ingredient) are served on the side.  - The Rainbow Salad is fresh and filled with lots of good stuff.  Plus, you can add a protein.  I've not tried the Kaya burger, nor the Kaya Veggie Burger, but each is on my list.  Plus, I suspect plenty of reviews have covered the burger already.  Finally, service is excellent.  People working there all seem pretty enthusiastic.",

Several people have raved to me about their chicken and waffles and I wanted the chance to indulge!    My wife ended up ordering the chicken and waffles, promising me a few bites so that I was able to order the tropical paella.  Last year I was first introduced to paella and loved it.  Needless to say, Kaya's paella was excellent. The scallops, mussels, and shrimp were blended beautifully with chicken and chorizo with not one element overtaking the dish.  I also thoroughly enjoyed the sampling of chicken and waffles I had from my wife's plate. For some reason, fried chicken always taste so much better with waffles and maple syrup! We ended up ordering some coffee and tea to go with our meals.  A little pricey for each, but we both needed a nice pickup after our filling meal.  Kaya definitely lived up to my expectations.  I really enjoyed our brunch here and was pleased to see the prices on the menu were reasonable for a nicer brunch place with good food. I saw a few things on the men that I would like to come back to try, especially the rainbow salad. Kaya is a solid choice for taste and price and I imagine this will be one of my default go to places in the strip when I'm in the area.",

The restaurant itself has a Mexico feel to it from the decors to the furnitures. The service was great and the food, although it seems pricey, is not bad for the amount and quality food that you get. We would totally go back again.  *DINNER*  Fried Chicken Tuna Poke Bowl (Highly recommend): Tuna poke bowl with a piece of fried chicken in a shape of a bowl AS the bowl. When I saw this on the menu, I know I had to get it. I LOVE sushi and to think that it can be served on a piece of fried chicken amazes me. The chicken was crispy and not too dry. The fish, the sauce, the mango, the seaweed, and everything else that was part of the poke bowl was fresh and perfectly seasoned. The portion was big enough for two meals. Who would've thought poke and fried chicken can go so well together?! Kaya did.  Dishes my friends ordered:  #1 Blue Bay Mussels (for an appetizer, it was the size of a meal)  Crispy Fish tacos  Tempura Avocado Banh Mi Tacos  Bread pudding",

Maybe we visited on an off day, but overall, I thought the food was pretty bland.  It was nice to sit outside and people-watch on the Strip, tho, and the White Sangria was excellent with fresh orange juice and bits of crisp green apple.  The service was top-notch, too.  When our first batch of Corn and Lentil Fritters came out with sticky, liquefied batter still in the middle, our server was most apologetic.  And the manager herself came over to apologize as well and let us know the appetizer would be removed from the bill.  Wonderful.  I would have been happier if the fritters had more zing, tho.  The green curry sauce that accompanied them was phenomenal and completely outshone them.  Speaking of green curry sauce, I ended up dousing my Jerked Tofu Tacos with the remainder of it.  When I hear \"jerk\" I think of that puckery vinegar tang and that punch-you-in-the-mouth Scotch bonnet heat.  I think \"FLAVOR.\"  Kaya's tacos were pretty tame and unremarkable.  And before you go all pooh-poohing and saying something about how tasteless tofu is, what did I expect? -- I've had some mighty flavorful tofu dishes in my time!  Husband had the Pulled Pork and Banana Sandwich, an interesting pairing which he seemed to enjoy.  However, the accompanying sweet potato fries were flaccid.  Don't you just hate a flaccid fry?  With so many fabulous restaurants in Pittsburgh and so little time each visit, I don't feel tempted to return to Kaya.  Big ups for the great service, tho.",

The Kaya burger looked unique and delicious, so I set out across town to try one.  Maybe it was the beef (which did arrive cooked perfectly), or maybe it was just that the kaya sauce just didn't jive with the fried egg, pickles, and avocado.  Whatever it was, while I enjoyed the burger (great bun, and delicious fries), it didn't WOW me like I had hoped it would.  The interior is super cute, and the service was good though the kitchen was slow.  That gave me more time to drink, which is always fine, though Kaya's bar was a little on the light side for worthwhile beers.  3.5 stars, rounded down, but I will without question be stopping by Kaya next time I'm through Pittsburgh to try some of their other menu items.

I wouldn't necessarily classify this as a Caribbean restaurant just because they have a few jerk dishes on the menu but I would definitely recommend the Cemita! I did have the pomegranate mai tai which many reviews raved about but I didn't really enjoy it and neither did my friend. It wasn't as sweet as described and it was too strong for my liking. Overall great ambiance, great for friends and if you go definitely try the Cemita!",

    "text": "Note to readers: this review is of the Sunday Brunch menu and cocktails, the bartender Joe who I want to tell stuff, and the conch hushpuppies in particular.    Oh, brunch.  That meal of the week where you can justify literally drinking vodka for breakfast.  So Hemingway.  While we're on the subject, Kaya has different vodka infusion options for your bloody mary pleasures.  They have a cucumber vodka, a cilantro vodka, a red pepper vodka and a......jalepeno one?  Don't quote me on that I just forget the last one.  I asked for half cucumber and half cilantro and then ended up drinking Ned's red pepper one because I liked his better and he conveniently thought the same about mine.    The conch hush puppies are really really good.  I love appetizers (especially at 11 in the morning) that make you go \"oooooooo\" (shudder spicy shudder) \"mmmmm\".  If you can wrap your head around that.  They give you some slivered onions and peppers on the side with a lime.  I made a little salsa on my plate and ate it all together and it was pretty wonderful.  The pork eggs benedict were just a touch too sweet for me and lacking in salt but that's more of a personal problem.  Ned's huevos rancheros were so, so good but then he ruined it with chorizo.  Blegh!    I'm going to have to come back for another meal to see about the rest of the menu and then we'll talk about that missing star.    Service was impeccable and WHILE we're on the subject, Joe, who mostly took care of us (though Nate did too and he also did a great job) is going to San Francisco tomorrow (Thursday) and I wanted to tell him in writing to A) check out my Best of California list of reviews here on yelp because they're all pretty spot on (as usual) and B) the place I told you to go to which you may have already been to and may not go to and I don't care if you do but in case you forgot it's called Bi-Rite Creamery on 18th by Dolores Park and get the salted caramel ice cream and, if you're feeling bold, get one of their sundaes.",

This weekend, I went back for a brunch with a couple girlfriends -- and everyone agreed about its collective deliciousness.   The brunch started with a basic mimosa -- don't let the pulp scare you away (if that kind of thing scares you away from OJ, as it usually does for me); this drink is incredibly refreshing. I had the eggs benedict (sans cornbread, since the server/chef confirmed it is NOT gluten-free... bummer). The smoked salmon and hollandaise sauce was perfection together. And holy plate of grilled pineapple! What a nice complement to the meal.   I love my old standbys in this city, and this Caribbean-inspired cafe endures at the top of the list.  Five, brunchin' big stars, Kaya!",

    "text": "Somehow without even checking Yelp I managed to stumble into one of the trendiest brunch places in Pittsburgh! Apparently this is a Caribbean restaurant, but I couldn't really tell from the menu. I do appreciate that there are a variety of vegetarian and vegan options!  I had the eggs cemita (torta) with cilantro, pickled red onion, avocado, black bean, chipotle aioli, and Oaxaca cheese. The sandwich had tons of flavor. You can't argue with eggs and melty cheese! At first I thought it was silly that the sandwich came wrapped in parchment paper, but it would have been really messy otherwise, so that was a smart call.  With a sandwich you have the option of hash browns, waffle fries, sweet potato fries, or salad as a side. I should've gone with waffle fries inside of sweet potato--the sweet potatoes were old. I also tried a bite of the Rainbow Salad; it was SO delicious and definitely an exciting lighter option!  The location is great; since Kaya is on a corner, you can soak up the vibes of the Strip without feeling like someone is selling a vegetable two inches from your face. There's a lot of outdoor seating that's perfect for people watching, but I was happy to be seated right away indoors with air conditioning!  It was a pretty affordable brunch at only ~$15 per person with tip. Of course, we didn't indulge in any of the brunch cocktails! Although the restaurant was full, the service was super fast so we could get back to touring Pittsburgh in no time. Overall, Kaya has a great atmosphere and some interesting menu options. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to recharge while in the Strip!",

    "text": "Came here for my friend's 21st birthday dinner with a group of 6 people. The atmosphere didn't seem too crowded for a prime dinner time or during happy hour time (5:30-6:30pm). But the service was pretty slow throughout our dining. It took a while for our food to get ordered as well as be brought to us. Also we brought a cake to eat there after the dinner portion and asked if they could store it for us in their kitchen so we assumed that it'd be refrigerated at least - but when the cake was brought out, it was lukewarm and definitely was not refrigerated. I thought it was a basic rule to know that something like this should be refrigerated but was disappointed that it wasn't. Also we mentioned it was our friend's birthday, but there was nothing in particular that was done for her birthday? Seemed kind of like there wasn't anything special that Kaya does for birthdays, for example singing happy birthday or having some of the workers gather to sing? Also the person refilling the water came too frequently that it was almost disturbing our dinner. And lastly, when we got our checks, they gave it to us with the customer copy on top when the merchant copy should be on top. Maybe these are petty things I'm reviewing about but I think these are also basic restaurant manners. I would give the service a 3/5.   We shared the Jerked Pork & Plantain Nachos appetizer. The plantain chips were really good but I would say that the flavors were not consistent throughout. For my dinner entree I ordered the flank steak cemita, which was a sandwich with sliced pieces of steak, romaine lettuce, avocado, tomato, cilantro, pickled red onion, Oaxaca cheese, black bean and chipotle aioli. I got a side of sweet potato fries to go with that. The cemita was actually very good. All the flavors blended very well together. I didn't feel that it was seasoned too salty or too bland. Overall was very pleased with my entree order. I would give the food a 4/5.   Not sure if I would come here again any time soon just because it is more of a high-end restaurant that college students would not be able to afford very often.",

So that is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. I had a brunch entree that I would describe as brunch nachos. It had chorizo and a fried over easy egg on top.

It's located in a very unique neighborhood call the Strip that has a long street with a bunch of small mom and pop type shops. The area is a little run down but retains its old time charm.  We asked what the top sellers were in the restaurant were and surprisingly the burger was not on the list. Whaaatttt??? Our waitress recommended the carribean salad and chicken sandwich. We ordered the salad and the burger.  The salad was nice but needs a little more robust dressing than just fresh lime. My friend had the burger and said it was amazing.

I have tried a couple of appetizers and seem to always order the \"conch hush puppies\" with spicy habanero aioli and mango! Absolutely delicious with a nice kick to it. Also, if you do love seafood you really cannot go wrong with the tropical paella. The serving was huge for the price at lunch time and very filling with a very generous portion of shrimp, scallops, mussels etc. It also has some nicely flavored chicken and chorizo in it. Definitely one of the best paella I have had so far in Pittsburgh. We have also tried the Flank Steak Cemita and what can I say? The meat was tender and oh so good. I have expected a \"normal burger\", but what I got was so much better than this. With all the food we tried the white sangria, which was very fruity and on the sweeter side, but delicious.  I have been here at dinner times and it can get very busy in here difficult to get a seat, but trust me, even if you have to wait, it's going to be worth it!",

Every ingredient, garnish, sauce or accompaniment in each dish is carefully thought through and net effect is just out of this world! This is one of those places where I find myself noticing and appreciating little touches like the crispy fried garlic shavings sprinkled on a dish, for instance. It's apparent that they strive for quality and it shows. I don't think I've eaten even one mediocre dish at Kaya. I particularly enjoy the shishito peppers and the tempura avocado banh mi tacos. Their cold soups are also fantastic! Their vegetarian prix fixe event (with vegan options too), which happens on the 3rd Wednesday of every month and is not to be missed and is worth every penny. Don't forget to make your reservations in advance though because it is a popular event and gets full! Kaya is most definitely among my favorite restaurants in the Burgh, perfect for a date, a birthday dinner, or even just happy hour drinks after work!",

It is a long, thin restaurant with a slightly larger room in the back.  When you walk in, there is a long bar on one wall and a long series of tables along the other wall.  The tables are easily configured so that you can have parties of two or move tables together for larger parties.  I've come with parties as large as eight and they were accommodating for any size party. The menu has a variety of options and although it changes seasonally, there are some items that seem to be staples and always on the menu.  There are a wide variety of appetizers, really something that will please every palate.  What I like is that although entrees are on the pricier side ($20+ each) there are appetizers that are substantial enough that you can make a meal from one or two of them.   My favorite entree I've had was a steak with chili rellenos.  It was packed full of flavor and a pretty substantial portion size.  In terms of appetizers, my favorites have been the yucatan bean dip and conch fritters.  Both are unique and full of flavor. The drink menu offers many tropical options and standard fare as well.  I did find the drinks a bit overpriced for the size you get, but they were very tasty. Kaya is an enjoyable dining experience and I will be back/",

    "text": "Kaya is a Big Burrito joint and aims to hit the Caribbean in both atmosphere and flavor profile. I would say it succeeds moderately well in both departments.   We had a number of dishes and drinks so I think we got a decent cross section of their offering.   We both started with the Pisco Sour (we can't say no to egg white froth!) and gave the jerk wings and the curried cauliflower a shot as apps.   The wings were spicy in a good way, but not spectacular. In fact, they tasted like regular old wings with jerk sauce poured over them. They were, however, plated on a creamy herb sauce that was quite excellent.   The cauliflower was good, and had an interesting sauce and pistachios that actually gave it a new angle.   The main dishes were oxtail (from the Trinidad special menu) as well as the famous rainbow salad with flank steak.   Although the oxtail was very good, the portion size was tiny and not commensurate with the $15 price tag.   The salad, however, was something to write home about! Hot damn, that was the best salad \"as-a-meal\" I've ever had! It was colorful with a dozen different ingredients, well dressed and perfectly cooked flank steak chunks. I would honestly go back for this salad alone.   We sat at the bar, and service was decent, despite the busy night. All in all a good experience!",

The size of the fish, the crunch of the fish, the flavor of the rest - just perfect, everything you'd want in a fish taco.  Everything else was fantastic too.  Food is top notch, highly recommend!  The only negative I can say is when we took a seat at the bar to wait for a table, the bartender was terribly inattentive and slow.  She didn't seem to care to be there.  Took forever for her to just come over to us to get our first drink, and it's not like the bar is huge or something.  So my advice is she's got to go.  But thankfully the food more than made up for that experience.  So 5 stars it is.",

My co-worker and I ordered the Roasted Brussels sprouts and cauliflower tropas (appertizer?), the Conch and corn chowder, strip steak tacos and the Pumpkin Creme Brulee. Everything was really good except for the Pumpkin Creme Brulee. The Pumpkin Creme Brulee made me think of baby food with a sugar hard top. I love creme brulee and this was a no bueno for me.   Server was very polite and had a spunk to him. We ordered, drinks came out, food came out and dessert came out very quickly.

As our party trickled in, he told us to try and stay in our seats throughout the dinner as to make it easier come check time.   My gf and I were one of the first to arrive and he made sure to get us some tasty beverages to sip on. We both had 2 mojitos ($9/piece)! They were soooo refreshing with a good amount of mint!  We had an order of salsa and chips prior to our meal. The salsa was also very refreshing. A lot of the girls commented on not expecting it to be as fruity as it was but enjoyed it. The fruit was bonus in my book :)  I ordered the fish tacos ($18). They were fried and I wish there had been a grilled option but they were still pretty damn delicious. There were three on the plate with a HEAPING portion of cilantro (triple bonus points for this). I only ate 2! I NEVER leave a (fish) taco untouched and I was sad.... but the two I ate were so good I was definitely satisfied.   The bathrooms are quite small and dark but overall the ambiance in the restaurant is intimate and tropical. The place was packed the entire time we were there but there was room at the bar.  I can't wait to make someone take me back here! Ha",

Happy hour beer prices were great, and my waitress even stopped by to ask if I wanted another drink before happy hour was over.   I always love that!  The interior is beautiful as well.I ended up getting the Avocado and Tomato Torta, which was excellent. My only complaint about it (& others complained about this with their burgers) was that the thing was just too big to pick up and take a bite out of. Trying to cut it and eat it was kind of difficult too. They also had some really awesome sweet potato fries. Visiting the website I found this:  \"On the third Wednesday of each month, Kaya presents a seasonal vegetarian prix fixe dinner. The menus emphasize flavor and variety, presenting familiar foods in exciting ways, and making exotic foods delightfully accessible. Menu items are also available a la carte.\" Because of that, I took this from a 4 star to a 5 star review because as a vegetarian, this is hugely appealing to me and makes me want to go there again!",

My only complaint was that we asked for them to alter the dessert, which was a choice between chocolate brownie a la mode and a chocolate-lined taco, and they just brought us a scoop of vanilla and a scoop of raspberry on a plate. For that kind of money, I think they could've made more effort, as it was two desserts (my husband and me) so why one plate? And couldn't there have been a substitution? Plus our Mon Aimee chocolate, which was also part of the price fixe dinner, was a tiny chunk. I think the kitchen must've gotten confused and thought they were serving one person. That was my only sore point. If they had been more accommodating and hospitable about the desserts, I would've given them more stars. I still recommended Kaya to friends who visited Pittsburgh.",

Saturday night we were in the mood for something a little different and Kaya seemed to fit the bill. We had a 7:00 pm reservation, however, I do not believe that a reservation would have been necessary. Things didn't start off too well, as the hostess tried to seat us at the banquet next to a gentleman at the next table who was fixated with the TV and had his butt blocking off half our table. When we insisted on another seat and pointed out several available, the hostess said \"I think we are expecting a table of 10 and need that space\". Well, alrighty then.   We did get a different table without an over hanger, but then it seemed to take awhile for our server to greet us. Adam was very nice and very knowledgeable concerning the menu.   I had a Key Lime marguerita. BJ had a Red Stripe beer. We were starving so we ordered up a couple appetizers. We got shrimp fritters with spicy mango sambal. They were delicious but I thought they were a little stingy with the sambal. BJ got Jamaican jerk wings with cilantro cream. He said they were very crispy and tasted good. He also really like the cream sauce.   For dinner I got the tempura battered chili relleno stuffed with hominy and crinimi mushroom stuffing and served on slaw. Adam reported that the chef had recently changed the recipe and inquired if I liked it (I was only able to eat a little less than half). I thought it was definitely the best chili relleno that I have ever eaten. The only downside was that it was served slightly warm. I like my food just like I like my men, hot and toasty! BJ had the Tropical Paella. It was chicken, chorizo, shrimp, bay scallops, mussels, pineapple, roasted red peppers and sugar snap peas. I managed to steal a couple snap peas which were awesome. But BJ, who always cleans his place, didn't finish. He reported that the portion was plentiful, but he expected the dish to be a little more Spanish type flavored, rather than a jambalaya. Also, he thought was over seasoned, the flavors could have been a bit some subtle.   For dessert, we shared a single scoop of \"mystery\" sorbet. It was a mix of mango, ginger, lemon, etc. and after eating it, the rest of the flavors is still a mystery. It was a great finish to the meal.   Our take was that the restaurant was just okay, nothing special and definitely not the place to go for a romantic meal.",

    "text": "Solid 4 stars, could be more after additional planned visits.  No tables available at 5 on a Sunday but the seats at the bar were comfortable and the bartender's service impeccable. When we left at 6:30 there were people standing and waiting. Closing time is at 9 so dinner reservations must be earlier than the usual.  The Caribbean vibe is unobtrusive but more of a bright rather than boring surrounding and typical of Big Burrito ambiance. The value is better than some of the other Big Burrito restaurants.  The appetizers - chips and salsa were veered to the island side with house? fried (over- fried to almost bitter actually) potatoes? taro? very thin with a chunky fruit salsa with a few bits of jalapeno that read more like a fruit salad than a sauce. The watermelon gazpacho was tasty and simple, almost clear, and not too sweet. The lentil bean beignets were delicious with a green curry sauce that was white in color like ranch and more sweet than I expect green curry sauce to be. The beignets were spicy and though fried not greasy. Easily my favorite and the most unique item ordered and the spice level delivered. The pork quesadilla was super though served with an odd sauce that reminded me strangely of hollandaise and on a soft flour tortilla from Reyna's (local Mexican market in the Strip). The burger combination was a good safe choice if you like the toppings of nicely peppered bacon, sunny-side egg, avocado, cheese and I'd leave off the special mayonnaise sauce.  The seared tuna was perfectly done. The spice level was lower than I expected. While there is a bit of spice the overall tone seems to be geared towards a more conservative palate in contrast the menu reads as more spicy than it is.",

A few places we tried to go to were closed (which I thought was odd for a Sunday when both the Pirates and Steelers had home games), so we ended up going to Kaya based on the good reviews onlined.  We got there at around 3:00, and I was upset when I found out that I couldn't order some of the dishes I saw on the online menu, because they don't start serving dinner until 4:00.  So I ended up \"settling\" for the Cuban sandwich.  It turned out to be one of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life.  My wife had a chorizo and eggs breakfast dish that she loved also.  So the food was amazing, the place has nice decor, good music at an appropriate (not too loud volume), and the Pirates game on the TV.  Next time in Pittsburgh I'd like to go back and try some of the things I didn't get the chance to order off of the dinner menu.  Oh, and the food was very reasonably priced.  $10 for an amazing sandwich, waffle fries and some pickles!",

    "text": "I've visited Kaya several times now, both for lunch and dinner. This review is a little bit biased in that I'm generally not a big fan of the \"island cuisine\" that Kaya serves. It's one of my least favorite \"Big Burrito\" restaurants.  As such, I've never independently chosen this restaurant as a place to eat,  I've only met people who are already there.   Nevertheless, I always receive friendly and knowledgeable service from the waiters. In terms of the appetizers, I enjoy the calamari and the tuna tartare. My favorite entrees (the only ones I can order, really) are the kaya burger and the crispy fish tacos.  The burger is huge and packs a punch, but for some reason has a sunny side up egg on top of it. I don't understand where the egg fits into island cuisine, but ok. The fish tacos are less substantial but still very tasty.   I'm don't like \"jerk\" spicing, but if you are, you will have a great deal to choose from on the menu. EVERY category of food from the tapas to the appetizers to the main courses has SOMETHING \"jerked.\" Hey, did I mention \"the new phone book's here!?\"  All around, Kaya has quick and nice staff but few offerings for a lady who doesn't like the cuisine theme, so three stars it is.",

We started with the Kaya chips with mango salsa. The chips were very good, however some were a little too burnt. The salsa was amazing though, and I loved the kick that the chips had to them! I was in a Kaya kind of mood, so I also got the Kaya burger, med well, with sweet potato fries and this cayenne dipping sauce (one of many sauces they offer). The burger was perfect with just enough pink, and the avocado and egg was the perfect blend. The sweet potato fries were awesome, hard to mess that up.",

The soup was excellent, luscious without being overly creamy, and topped with some notably tasty fried sage. The sweet potato fries were nothing to write home about, but were a nice accompaniment. Decent prices, could have been more creative, but I'd go back for lunch. There are certainly other, better places in the Strip, though.",

After an hour, we finally got some good. The table was positioned so that you could see into the kitchen. We saw our server standing over the food she was supposed to be boxing, eating something else. Completely gross.   Additionally, saw several people in street clothes bring guests into the kitchen for a few minutes, then leave - seemed like employees bringing their girlfriends for a tour.   The food and drinks were 2 stars at worse, but slow, rude service and grossness gives it 1.",

I was really looking forward to try the Island cuisine. The ambiance and service was pleasant and the appetizers were great. The cilantro- lime and cilantro cream sauce were unique and delicious. The Jamaican jerk wings were finger licking good, nice crispy skin with perfect spice-cover and juicy flesh with cilantro-cream sauce. The house-chips, black bean dip and mango salsa were great too. We ordered a plate of lentil-corn beignets too, after looking at the Yelp photographs , however was disappointed by the taste. The food went downhill from there. We ordered fish tacos and Huevos Rancheros. Two friends ordered the steal entree and shrimp omelette, which weren't all that amazing. I think the food severely lacked salt which is essential to bring out the real flavor in every dish. The Rancheros dish was too dry and bland and I couldn't finish mine, even after asking for extra sauce. One friend jokingly suggested that the appetizer menu looked so interesting, that we should just order all of them and make that our lunch. I wish we did that.",

Ambiance is OK. The location in the Strip is great but I wouldn't return unless the menu has changed and no other alternatives are available.

Our food arrived and was great.  I got the pulled pork with bananas and the chipotle tomato soup.  Everyone in our group loved their food.  But again, when we waited for the check, it took a good 20 minutes after we were finished for it to come, and another 10 to get our bills back to sign.    If I was to rate the restaurant on food alone I would give it a 4 star rating, but over an hour and a half for sandwiches when the place was empty?  That's ridiculous.  I would hate to see what the service is like when the place is full!  Final verdict:  It is a great place to go if you have no plans afterwards or have anywhere that you need to be.

I got an old fashioned; my girlfriend got the mojito and both were great. I got the kaya burger and it was amazing. She got the tropical paella and loved it.

The veggies were cut oddly with huge chunks of carrots and tiny pieces of green beans and cauliflower among other veggies making for hard carrots and the rest of the veggies overcooked and soft.  So disappointing.  My dining partner tried hers, but didn't even eat it.  Not wanting to hurt the waiter's feelings, she had him pack it up and then tossed it in the trash outside.    I guess Fried Chicken Thursday is the night to go.  It sure wasn't Monday.  Hard to believe this is a Big Burrito restaurant.",

    "text": "Underwhelmed.  Went here a little while back with a friend visiting from out of town.  Our overall impression?  Non-memorable food, and mildly tacky decor led to a \"meh\" type experience.  We started with the chips and mango salsa.  This was pretty good; their chips are made in-house and were tasty.  My friend enjoyed the salsa more than I did, which could be because I didn't expect the mango-tomatillo to be quite so sweet.  Could definitely appreciate their fresh ingredients.  Sangria was super-sour.  To mitigate this, our server suggested simple syrup, and brought some for us to mix in as we saw fit.  Take this as you may.    On to entrees:  Friend got the jerk pulled pork quesadilla which was soggy and over-stuffed with pork (i.e. the cheese-to-pork ratio was definitely off).  Although she consumed far less than half of it, she had no desire to pack the rest, and left it to soak in its own juices a bit further.  I ordered the chicken breast with confit enchiladas.  While the chicken was good, it wasn't anything I'd make a special trip for again.  The confit enchiladas, however, were memorable - in a bad way.  They were over-cooked, tasting like re-microwaved taquitos.  Not even taquitos that were good to begin with, prior to the round 2 reheating.  Yikes.  The outer shell was also quite oily/greasy in appearance and in taste.  In essence, could have done without the enchiladas.  The barstools with hanging faux leather palm tree leaves gave my friend the sense that were in a cheap Caribbean hotel's lobby.  Yikes again.  Maybe a bit harsh, but Kaya, you just weren't my fav.",

The tacos were OK.  Not the best I have ever had, great flavor, but the fish wasn't as crunchy as I would have liked.  The prices were also really high, I think.  17$ for tacos is a lot.  We had some starters too, corn and lentil balls and tuna tartar.  The corn and lentil balls were good, the tuna was just OK.  They did have a great beer list selection and our waitress was great!",

We had the queso app and it was fantastic- the pita bread is soft and delicious! Husband had salmon eggs benedict and loved it. It comes with a heaping portion of pineapple, which I can only assume most people take home for later. I had the paella, which was good but not great. They lose a star for service- we didn't have a reservation (didn't know we needed one for brunch- don't make our mistake!!!) so they if ignored our 2-person table for most of our meal. We had to call the waitress repeatedly. Note, the tables are very close together, so when I say \"call her\" she was standing right next to me, checking on the table to my left and to my right but outright ignoring our table. Took them 20 minutes (not exaggerating) to bring the leftovers *after* paying. If it wasn't pricey I would've left, but the busboy was very courteous when I pointed out that he still had not brought them back. Overall, make a reservation and you will have a great 5-star experience!!!",

A friend I went there last week and we got the black bean dip (delish) and then I ordered the Jamaican jerk wings which I really enjoy with their cilantro cream sauce which is delectable. She got the fish tacos which I had a bite out of and they were sooooo good!   We also got the BBQ Tofu thingy and have to admit - NOT a huge fan. There was little flavor to them and they had a cinnamony taste which was weird. Maybe I was expecting the Tofu that they have at Mad Mex as an appetizer (I think it's Asian inspired) which is really really good.   So although I wasn't blown away by all the food, the fact that we were getting 1/2 off drinks and 90% of the food was very tasty - I think I'll check this place out more often!",

This place is not very big and they draw huge business. Reservations are a must, even for 5:30pm on a Thursday.  We arrived during happy hour where everything from the bar is half off.  The drink list is outstanding.  They have a huge offering of cocktails, wines, and diverse beers (I had a great India Brown Ale).  This isn't too surprising because the bar takes up almost half the space of the entire restaurant.  We started off with the conch fritters and mango-tomatillo salsa which were both extremely flavorful.  Everyone at the table agree that the pulled pork quesadilla, the fish tacos, and the Kaya burger were excellent.  Our waiter was very attentive as well.  Prices were reasonable for what we had.  Overall, Kaya is a great place for Caribbean fare.  Make sure you call for a reservation if you want a table (they're not on Opentable).  Compared to other Big Burrito restaurants, Kaya definitely appeals to a younger crowd. When we walked out it seemed like almost everyone in the place was under 25.  You may or may not view that as a good thing.",

    "text": "I went here to partake in their Fried Chicken Thursday. You get an entire half a chicken fried with old school pasta salad, a vinegary coleslaw and a stack of fresh tortilla straight from Reyna's Foods down the block. We started off with the Yucatan Bean Dip appetizer. If you've ever had the bean dip at Mad Mex you'll recognize it. It's beany, slightly salty and a little spicy. Very flavorful.  I have to say, the chicken is a little steep at 15 dollars a plate but I thought it was amazing. The chicken was delicious and browned nicely and the ranch-style dip they give you is a really good with accompaniment. I love being able to pick apart the chicken and put it in the tortilla and make myself a little taco. I'm a huge fan of Mexican food so blending southern cuisine with the containment system of a Mexican tortilla is great. I hate coleslaw, especially mayo-based. If it is a vinegar based slaw I tend to like it a wee bit more. The coleslaw I had at Kaya was so good I ate all of it. It had little bits of pepper in it, a huge vinegary kick and a spiciness that I think came from ginger.  The pasta salad was like what your grandma would make. The chef at Kaya really must like the sourness of vinegar, however, because it's really evident in this dish as well. Luckily, I love that in food. I could see a lot of people being overwhelmed by it.  The only complaint was when my girlfriend ordered a Mojito. When it came I took a sip and thought it was pretty bad. It mostly tasted like alcohol and the ripped mint floating inside overwhelmed it to the point where you couldn't taste the mint anymore so much as the leafy flavor underneath. I did not care for it at all.  I definitely want to check out what Kaya has on their actual menu. I'll be back.",

The service and atmosphere of the place were great.  All of our drink and food orders came out relatively quickly, and with some time in between our appetizers and main dishes which I really like.  The drinks everyone ordered were put together perfectly and were all great.  Now for the food.  I had wanted to try Kaya for such a long time after hearing about their great burger and other food.  We started off with the Kaya chips which came with a mango-tomatillo salsa.  These were just ok.  I did not think the salsa had much flavor.  Next we had the jamaican jerk wings.  The wings were cooked perfectly, but did not have much of a jerk flavor to them.  They tasted more like regular fried chicken with a little seasoning salt.  The best part of these was the cilantro sauce they came with.  We also ordered the shishito peppers.  These were the best appetizer we had.  They had a great peppery taste and were a perfect spice level.  For my meal I went with the Kaya burger which came with avocado, bacon, a mexican cheese, an egg, and Kaya sauce.  You could tell the meat of the burger was high-quality.  The blend they used was great and made for a nice juicy patty.  The meat was overcooked to my order of medium rare request.  The toppings were just a little too much and did not compliment each other well.  Because of all the wet toppings the burger became very sloppy and was falling off of the bun.  If I were to order again, I think I would go without the egg.  Surprisingly the best part of my meal were the waffle fries.  Overall it was a good meal, but I had higher expectations.  Maybe I just had a bad experience.  I would definitely go back to try some other options.",

My experience was average overall and the downtown/Strip District scene has much better food to offer.   Kaya, owned by the Big Burrito company (own Mad Mex, Eleven, and Casbah), offers moderately priced Island/Grilled fare and attempts to transport guests to the tropics.   We ordered Jamaican Jerk chicken wings to start. These are good, and well seasoned. They came with a delicious white sauce. By far my favorite part of the meal.   For my entree, the Shrimp Po Boy sandwich underwhelming. Shredded chopped lettuce covers the mayo/aioli tossed shrimp and it's all lost in a large bread roll.   It was a Saturday lunch rush, so the restaurant was packed. Our servers was struggling to get to our table (and avoiding bumping into the tables to the back of him). Plus, it was hard waiting for the bathroom since the door opens to a main walkway the servers walk to. I was awkwardly standing between tables for the upstairs restroom and trying to stay out of the way for  those heading outside/back to the kitchen/to the tables.

Being vegetarian, we can sometimes be limited in what is offered, although fish is something we will eat on occasion. The restaurant itself was nice with unique decor, however it felt a bit small and cramped where we were sitting.   The menu had a lot to offer with a variety of choices. I ordered the eggs Benedict with salmon and my partner opted for the huevos rancheros. We also ordered the Kaya chips appetizer, which included potato and sweet potato chips and mango salsa. This was great and I recommend everyone try it! The eggs Benedict with smoked salmon was good, however it wasn't quite what I expected. I'm really weird about my eggs and they felt a little underdone to me, but that is just personal opinion. The flavors were amazing and if this is a dish you normally enjoy, I highly recommend. The huevos rancheros were AMAZING. I was disappointed I didn't get those as well they were so good. They even offered a vegan sausage option that was out of this world. Definitely recommend trying it even if you aren't vegan!  Overall really nice place for brunch, looking forward to trying some dinner items in the future!",

Banana ketchup ribs, conch fritters, Jamaican stir fry, Kaya burger, etc. It's all really good, a lot of it very playfully and creatively designed.  Now, the first time I visited, the service was great. No complaints at all. The second time this couldn't be further from the case. The place was essentially empty, and I sat at the bar. And sat. And sat.   The bartender/server there was completely non-responsive. It took upward of 45 minutes just to get a drink and pay my check after I sat there so long that I decided I wasn't going to get food anymore. What's worse is any time he went away, it was to sit at one of the tables in the dining room and talk to the servers/bussers. It was maddening.   I wish I had a more positive experience the second time around, but nonetheless, great food if you don't mind a risk of being ignored and killing a little bit of time there.",

About an hour after I ate here, I fell and broke my ankle badly while walking in a park downtown, just before I was planning to drive back to Toledo. I had to go to the ER. Now in May of 2019 I am still doing rehab and have a second surgery scheduled in June. I share this information to explain the severity of the injury.  In the weeks after I broke the ankle, in spite of the greivous injury, I was still in a good mood. This was partly due to my excellent weekend in Pittsburgh, which was due in part to my excellent last meal before my injury.",

I can't wait to come back and try some other menu options because my neighbor's Kaya burger looked to die for.   This place is really fun and bright, and I love the vibe. It temporarily transports you to a tropical paradise, and it's a great location with plenty of street parking. I came over my lunch break, and the service was quick, but not rushed.",

Not so with the salmon which also came with grilled asparagus and jicama. Both the eggs and salmon came with micro greens! So freaking good!!  UPDATE: Tonight, I came for dinner and had the Manchengo and Avacado Deviled Eggs, Caribbean Jerk Pork and Plantain Nachos, and Grilled flank steak. Another delicious and healthy dish. The flank steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare (note that I wasn't asked how I wanted it cooked). Peppers, mushrooms, avocados, cilantro, and a corn salsa. The salsa was quite vinegary, but I am into fermented foods and I am wondering if the salsa was fermented...That would make it even healthier. If it is not fermented, they need to work on their salsa recipe.   Last comment: they have my most favorite beer Dechutes Fresh Squeezed on tap along with some good local craft brews.",

We also very much enjoyed the fact that it was happy hour until 630 (not sure if this is unique to Monday evenings or if it is other days as well) so we could enjoy half price on all cocktails.

They are the perfect mix of savory, filling, spicy and well, delicious!! Each bite gets better and before you know it, all three tacos are gone!! We also tried their street corn and it was tasty with a good amount of spice to it!!  I hadn't been here in years and they appear to have revamped their food and drink menus to be quite a bit larger. I had a glass of red sangria, which I also think is the best in the city. It's a great subtle blend that's not too strong or over powered with tons of fruit, but gets that buzz going. My BF had the bartender's favorite cocktail called the \"pharmacist\" and although a bit strong, it was tasty as well. I was happy to see the restaurant lively at both the bar and tables on a Thursday night. Our food came out fairly quickly and our bartender was the perfect combination of attentive and respectful. I hope the road construction is finished soon because Kaya still holds it down as one hip, cool and delicious spot unique to Pittsburgh.",

We decided not to say anything or make a big deal. 2) food came out at disparate times making it awkward while some people ate while others had to wait. 3) waitress missed the side order of fries that one of us ordered. Should be noted that she didn't write anything down.  Brought it to her attention right away but fries came well after we were all done eating. 4) my daughters chicken sandwich was inedible. My son got the same thing and his was fine. But here was either uncooked or a bad piece of meat because she couldn't bite through or even cut the piece of chicken. We sent it back but her replacement didn't come out until well after we were all done eating.  We are low key and rarely make waves. But given the occasion this was a highly disappointing experience.  $200 for 6 people which is fine if a good experience. Not sure if we will ever be back tbh.",

My husband and I stopped in without a reservation, but we were seated outside immediately. Our server Justine was right on it, with cold water, and within a few minutes there was a pineapple-strawberry Mai Tai in my hand.   Thursday's are fried chicken night, and after seeing so many other patrons had ordered it, my dining partner couldn't resist! He also got the conch chowder which was delicious. The conch was sweet, and not chewy or rubbery at all - it tasted like conch chowder from a place in the Bahamas I've been too.   I got the heirloom tomato salad and order of crab cakes as my meal. I loved the avocado puree that was plated with the tomatoes- so flavorful, I will have to try and recreate it at home. My crab cakes were excellent too- sweet chunks of crab with a mango and red pepper salsa on top. There was a little something extra in one of the crab cakes, and our server was quick to bring me another order, she also took them off the check without me saying anything - I would have been happy to pay for them since they brought a replacement, but nice gesture.   I live on the west coast, but will definitely come back to Kaya on our next Pittsburgh trip. I'm still thinking about that heirloom tomato salad!!",

We started with the Kaya chips and mango salsa. The salsa was straightforward and delicious but the chips were absolutely horrible. They didn't go very well with the salsa and ruined the appetizer. I believe they were some type of homemade potato chips, but they were overdone and an inappropriate pairing with the salsa. A simple tortilla would have been more satisfying. The place was quite the \"twist\" on Caribbean... in fact it wasn't very Caribbean at all. A few menu items seemed Caribbean \"inspired\" but mostly the menu was unfocused. The interior was decorated very nicely, but the country music playing throughout the restaurant was strange to hear. When I go to a restaurant that supposedly features ethnic food, I hope to have an authentic experience. The saving grace of this restaurant was my delicious entree and the great service. I had the avocado tempura Bahn mi tacos and they were excellent. I swapped my side for the watermelon gazpacho which was excellently done. While this is a great restaurant, it's an insult to call this spot Caribbean but it was definitely worth the stop.",

    "text": "Amazing way to spend a Sunday. I visited Kaya for brunch, which is only offered on Sunday, and was pleasantly impressed. From the moment we walked in the door, we were thoroughly taken care of. The hostess, whose name I didn't catch, was a wonderful woman who offered us a table even though they had a reservation coming in at 2.   We opted for the mojito and grapefruit-basil margaritas instead of traditional brunch cocktails and they were fantastic. The tropical guac (order the homemade kaya chips to substitute the tortilla chips) was awesome, I really wanted to take it home with me. We chose the chicken and waffles (it came with a spicy Tabasco butter which added an extra layer of flavor) and the huevos rancheros. I was super excited that the huevos rancheros came with ~more~ of the tropical guac, but it was all in all a fantastic dish. The bacon was peppery and delicious, albeit I wish it was a bit crispier, but it was a great juxtaposition to the sweetness of the grilled pineapple.  I'll have to come back and see what Kaya has to offer besides an awesome brunch, but if brunch is what you're in the market for, definitely come check it out next time you are doing your Sunday shopping in the Strip.",

I'm a big fan of cilantro, & that was pretty strong in the green curry sauce. I could rave (and eat) all day.   Friend & I joked about making a list about reasons to come back to visit Pittsburgh. Bottom line: beignets make the list.",

My major complaint is that even though we did have a reservation, we still ended up waiting for almost half an hour for our table to be ready for us.  We waited at the bar and had a couple mojitos and it was just fine.   Once seated, though I was not sure where to go with the menu, our server was incredibly helpful.  Honestly, our waitress was so nice, and definitely part of what made my experience at Kaya so great.  She wholeheartedly recommended the paella, and I wholeheartedly accepted her recommendation.  This dish is a mix of pretty much everything but it is SO GOOD, and the portion is HUGE.  I was a bit embarrassed that when I finished, it barely looked like I made a dent in the dish, and unfortunately I was unable to take the leftovers with me, but I left as a very satisfied customer.",

    "text": "I was really worried coming here for brunch. It was like seeing a friend after a very long time. You're pretty sure you're still going to like them, but something could go terribly wrong and you'll be disappointed at the hope of a long lasting relationship.   Kaya is my go to joint for happy hour. Hands down they have thee best happy hour in the city. I mean, half off EVERYTHING! Even shots (okay, things get a little crazy when you enter that into the equation). And, of course, if you're drinking it up you also have to get some nourishment. Coming here so much, I've gone down the menu with my meals and not-a-one has let me down! All amazing... Big shout out to the Fish Tacos.  I'd heard how good brunch was, but I really wanted it to live up to the normal Kaya standard. You can see why I'd be nervous. If they ruined something as sacred as brunch, what would be left? Maybe I'm being too dramatic, because you know I'd be back at that bar once it hit 5pm, but still... I was expecting a stellar meal.   I'm happy to report, they delivered, and then some! There were a handful of items that stood out to me, but the Salmon Eggs Benedict was the True winner. I believe the key item being corn bread instead of a biscuit. LOVED. IT. Every bite. The cornbread made the dish, but the hollandaise was a close second (you can't mess with a good sauce!). Eggs were perfect and salmon was smokey. The side dishes held their own with juicy sweet sauteed pineapples and a spicy potato hash. I really wanted to lick my plate clean.   They can do no wrong in my book. Come for brunch, stay for lunch and exit after dinner. You'll probably want to throw up after a full day spent eating and drinking at Kaya, but it will have been worth it, I swear!",

Located in Pittsburgh's Strip District neighborhood Kaya has an eclectic and festive atmosphere.  The staff are friendly and attentive and the menu should make everyone happy.  Happy hour is amazing - HALF OFF ALL DRINKS.  Sorry, I didn't mean to yell, but this is exciting information.  And they have awesome mojitos and margaritas.    On my most recent visit I had the tempura avocado Bahn Mi tacos.  I loved the carrot and radish garnish with the cilantro but this was just a little too spicy for me with the addition of the jalapenos.  I had to take the jalapenos off and then I enjoyed them much more.  You're given three very nice portions (tacos).    I also had the Kaya chips with mango salsa.  That salsa is amazing!  Kaya, I'll be back (likely during happy hour).",

We sat outside, and since the restaurant was located on a side street in the Strip District, it was quiet and relaxing.  She ordered the calamari as an appetizer, and me the bean dip.  We ate every crumb of both!  For our entree, we both had the avocado tacos.  Those were so-so.  I've made breaded and fried avocado before (there's might have been baked), and there's wasn't as good.  The tacos were topped with crunchy carrots and cabbage (possibly - not remembering so much now), with a drizzle of hot sauce.  Very fresh ingredients, but, eh.  Presentation was nice, but I think the dish could've used maybe a cilantro cream sauce or something to kick it up a notch.  The beer selection was pretty spot on, which I appreciated it.  We didn't get to try any of their yummy-sounding mixed drinks.  Maybe next time.  I would definitely go here again.",

    "text": "From the industrial look of Smallman Street, stepping in to Kaya is like walking into a tropical oasis. Beautifully decorated and colorful, there is a lot of character in the space. The owner is very friendly and it is apparent that this is a labor of love. We were seated for lunch and the server went over the menu with us, necessary as there are plenty of dishes with unfamiliar ingredients or combinations (pulled pork and banana, malanga).  She did not steer us wrong. We ordered chips and spicy-sweet salsa, and steamed buns with pulled pork. The house-made chips were composed of various starches, including malanga, a slightly-sweet root vegetable.  Our group ordered the Kaya burger, the pulled pork and banana sandwich, and rainbow salad. Rainbow salad is pretty special stuff (it's toasted garlic, spices, lots of different vegetables, and a lime to squeeze over it all, then mix) and Kaya's was a decent representation of it.  Everything was spot-on, overall. In the bathrooms - embossed guest towels! The floors, walls, bar, art - it can be upscale or kitschy depending on the mood. We are so happy we got here, and will be back in our Burgh travels.",

    "text": "It's taken me quite a while to eat at Kaya, but between a group of friends' invitation to eat here and a $10 off coupon I had to stop in and give the place a try this week. Overall I was definitely not disappointed.  I came in around 7:00 for dinner, which meant I missed their 4:30 - 6:30 happy hour. A minor disappointment on my part but not their fault by any means. Either because it was a Tuesday or because the happy hour was over the place wasn't super full when I came in; it was, however, still kind of noisy, and it was probably not the best place I could have gone with a large group of folks that wanted to talk. But we did just fine and managed to make ourselves heard without hurting our throats from yelling during the evening, so at least the noise levels weren't super bad. The restaurant also wasn't brightly lit but it was still bright enough for me to read my menus quite easily (and to enjoy the colorful murals, masks and other decorations in the place). The menu itself was so fun to read - the meals all looked flavorful and the drinks were definitely unique, so everything stood out to me. It was really hard to pick what I wanted.   I ended up ordering a Pomegranate Mai Tai and the fish tacos. Neither disappointed. The drink was simply delicious - it was made with Amrut Old Port rum, Myer's Dark rum, pomegranate liqueur, amaretto, and lime. The result was a tasty drink that was sweet, but not too sweet, with a twist. There just aren't enough words for how much I liked this drink - I can only say that my friends commented that I started beaming after my first sip!    And the fish tacos? Just excellent x3! There was definitely a moderate level of spiciness but I didn't think it was too much, so long as I paused to sip on my water and Mai Tai every couple bites. They were also crispy but not overcooked, so they had the right amount of crunch but also weren't overly dry (a problem I've found with other fish tacos in the past). Best of all there were plenty of toppings and sauces to top off the fish - avocado, cabbage slaw, a spicy sauce and cilantro - and as a result I got to enjoy a full taco featuring mouthfuls of flavor every time I took a bite.  After all that, I reeeeally wanted to have dessert - I just knew that it would be absolutely delicious, too (and it was! it was moist and yummy and OMG I'm running out of descriptive words to use) - but just didn't have the room to eat it there. So I asked if they could packed up a chocolate chip banana bread pudding for me to take home. They could! At that point I thought my night was more or less complete. Unfortunately dessert was about the point we saw a couple problems service-wise; our waitress actually put in the wrong dessert order for one person, which held us up a bit; there was also a major slowdown in service around that point, as our waitress stopped checking on the table so frequently. As a result it took 25 minutes to get our checks. Fortunately I had nowhere important to be on a Tuesday night, but I'd definitely be wary of eating here in a time crunch after that.  Well, service slowdown or not I would SO come back for another meal or just for a drink sometime; the dining and drink options here are worth any potential future hassle in my opinion, and I'm hopeful that what I experienced near the end of my night was just a fluke. Just a final word of advice for new Kaya diners: the spiciness in certain dishes can be a bit much if you're not a fan of spice, so it doesn't hurt to ask about this before you order any meals here. Personally, I'm not the biggest fan of spicy foods and I thought my meal was DELICIOUS, so I still recommend them.",

We also got the crab cakes which were pretty good but I wasn't really feeling the mango aioli that came with it but I guess that's personal preference.  For entrees, I got the pulled pork quesadillas and let me warn you IT WAS SPICY! I would say my tolerance for spicy foods is not bad but man my tongue was on fire to the point where I couldn't even enjoy my dish. My mom got the whole fried porgy, and I'm sure she enjoyed it because she devoured the whole thing. My dad got the jamaican green curry which he said was okay.

I had the Caribbean Flank Steak Stir Fry, and it was pretty much fabulous. The coconut rice was delicious. Seriously, delicious. The bigger pieces of steak were cooked to about medium rare and were a delight! The rest of the steak was good too, but not as amazing as the bigger pieces. It wasn't as spicy as they said it may be, and I added hot sauce, as I love spicy food. It was a toss up between Pickapeppa Sauce and Busha Brown's Pukka Sauce to put on the Stir Fry. The former was a more smoky chipotle sauce and the latter was a spicy sauce with good flavor, both tasty on the Flank Steak Stir Fry. My husband had the Jerked Pulled Pork Quesadillas with waffle fries as a side. He thought the fries were amazing and the quesadillas were good, not amazing. I would agree that the waffle fries were pretty much amazing! Crunchy and delicious.   I thought overall it was pretty delicious!",

Service was pretty slow - hence the four stars. The restaurant was pretty empty and we had to grab another waitress to get our drinks refilled after a while. Great atmosphere.",

We put our orders in and waited for our food. We waited a lot longer than 5 min... But when the food came it was pretty yummy! And the staff was personable and friendly. It seems like a great place to sit at the bar and have a drink but because of the music was so loud it really detracted from enjoying our meal.",

    "text": "I had really high expectations for this place after hearing so much about it, so that may be part of why I'm only giving it 3 stars, but I really didn't think it was that amazing.  I went with a group of 15 where we had a reservation a few weeks in advance for such a large group.  After we made our reservation, my understanding is that they later asked us to move the time up from our original 7pm to 7:45 pm since that was a less busy time for them, which I found kind of odd since they should give priority to who called first.  Since they close at 10pm and dinner with that large of a group can take while, around 9:40 they started bringing checks out even though some people's desserts hadn't arrived yet, which I also found to be unusual and kind of annoying when they did push our time up 45 min.    The service was just ok, but decent for such a large group.  When I sat down I had no drink menu (though did have a food menu) but there was one way on the other side of a very large table.  I asked the waiter for a drink menu and he said his hands were full but that there was already one on the table---ummm way down on the other end and people were using it.  He said he'd be back with one in a bit anyway, but when he came back he had no menu so I then had to eventually get it passed all the way down the table when he finally brings more.  They did have a very nice drink list, including an impressive draft selection that I was happy about.  As for the food, it was a little pricier than I was expecting for Caribbean food so I expected it to be amazing (most entrees in the upper $20's, and appetizers also expensive--chips and salsa was like $7/8!!).  I ordered the bbq tofu cracklings for an appetizer which was tasty but way too huge, and I normally really like generous portions--it filled up a HUGE plate and was bigger than my entree so I could not even eat half of it.  I would have much rather preferred a smaller appetizer for half the price.  It was tasty but there was a bit too much bbq sauce on it and it really was just fried not so crispy tofu, not sure why they called it cracklins--I was expecting something much crispier.  For my entree I ordered the flank steak and the presentation was beautiful and the fried egg on top was a nice touch.  I asked for it cooked medium and it came out exactly as I requested.  However, although it tasted quite good and flavorful, the steak was quite chewy, which was disappointing for something that looked so lovely.  I was expecting a higher quality of meat for the price ~$26.  The atmosphere and decor are very nice and the bar seems to be the centerpiece here although there's a decent amount of table seating.  I think I'd come back for their happy hour but I felt their dinner, while good, was not really a good value for the prices.",

Just didn't feel welcomed and  comfortable which is super rare for me anymore and lets just say I WILL NOT be returning.",

    "text": "Three words: Fried Chicken Thursdays.  I would go to Kaya any day of the week, as the entire menu is great, but it's the divinely battered and fried pieces of bird that appear every Thursday (and only on Thursdays) that are usually the reason for me travelling to the Strip.  The batter is perfectly seasoned and always crispy.  The meat is juicy and tender. Paired with Reyna's tortillas and the side and sauce of the week, the fried chicken never disappoints.  I'm also a huge fan of the conch fritters and the black bean dip.  While it is chicken that usually draws me to Kaya, vegetarians have plenty of excellent options.  This was my favorite place in the city when I was a vegetarian.  The cocktails are also good and the bar is a great place to sit.  I've been a fan of every bartender I've ever had at Kaya.  Absolutely worth a visit for anyone with any palette.  If you go on Thursdays or a weekend, be sure to make a reservation.",

After a through review of the menu and a few questions for our server we settled on the corn and conch chowder, ribs, soft shell crab bahn mi, and the mahi mahi satay.   The chowder was delicious full of conch and corn nice spice level and mildly sweet. The ribs were fall off the bone tender, we didn't need any utensils to eat them. The Mahi mahi was grilled me had a mild peanut sauce which was a nice twist on traditional satay. The star of the meal was the soft shell crab bahn mi sandwich, the crab was fried but not heavily battered, the bread was lightly toasted and flaky, the veggies were thinly shredded and the chicken liver mouse was a nice touch.  We finished the meal with the chocolate banana bread pudding, the chocolate didn't over power the banana, nice flavor and texture.  Great experience, our server, Tori, was pleasant, attentive and thoroughly explained the menu. The drinks are good as well.",

    "text": "What a great happy hour! My hubby and I grabbed drinks here the other night before our anniversary dinner at Eleven (which was also very good by the way).  Kaya's happy hour specials included half off most drinks. I got the caipirinha and grapefruit basil margarita and my husband got a frozen mango mojito and Kayapolitan. Wasn't a fan of the Kayapolitan, mainly because it tasted like juice. But our other drinks were delicious and strong (get Joe to make your drinks!). After two I was recommending the grapefruit margarita to everyone sitting around me, haha.   We also munched on the Yucatan hot bean dip which had some good kick to it. Unfortunately, I don't think their food is part of the happy hour, so you're looking at around $10 bucks for an appetizer. But when all was said and done, our bill came to $35 and we got 5 drinks and the bean dip (with a double portion of chips), so I'd call that a deal!   I hope to come back here soon and check out their dinner menu. In the meantime I'll definitely be back for more happy hour deliciousness.",

The blue mussels were bland, the black bean dip was tasteless (until our efforts, see below), and the tofu cracklins were soft and soggy.  Ah, but I must say that the waitstaff did their best. Unfortunately they can't make up for the failings of the kitchen.  After getting the tasteless black bean dip, we were determined to have something edible, as it was too late to head elsewhere. So we gave the waitress our requests, and she soon returned with chopped cilantro, chopped onion, salt, pepper, and chopped hot pepper. After mixing those in the appropriate amounts, we finally had something edible.... though I'm giving the restaurant no points for the work we did.  ... a shame too, because we've visited before and the food was quite enjoyable.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try Kaya for sometime because I spend a fair amount of time in Pittsburgh for business.   I journeyed here on a Tuesday night, there was a decent crowd at the bar and in the restaurant.   I was greeted at the host stand and escorted to my table.   I ordered a red sangria and the Kaya Chips and Tomatillo and Mango Salsa as a starter.  The couple at the next table had the conch hushpuppies and hot bean dip with Kaya Chips, which also looked very good.   The hot bean dip must be popular because almost every table in the surrounding area had the same appetizer.   The sangria was just ok, nothing to write home about, not particularly fruity tasty, especially for $10.   The chips and salsa....yum.   The Kaya Chips were homemade potato chips that were seasoned accordingly....slightly spicy but very flavorful.   I don't  think that the chip were a good pairing with the salsa.  I was expecting a yucca or tortilla chip.   The Salsa was EXCELLENT, just not with the potato chips.  The salsa was a great blend of flavors sweet, spicy, flavorful.  I saved the salsa to accompany my entree.   I was torn between the jerk chicken entree and the cuban sandwich.   I chose the jerk chicken, kinda wished I had chosen the sandwich.  The entree included 1/2 chicken, chopped into manageable pieces.  The chicken was served on top of red beans and rice and then topped with an heirloom tomato/avocado/jalapeno salad with a hint of lime juice.  The highlight of this dish was the salad and the salsa that I had saved.  The chicken was not what I expected, the jerk seasoning was just not apparent.   I also think that the price point was a bit high at $24.  The chicken was moist and tender but just didn't taste like jerk chicken and the red beans and rice were just ok.    I would return to Kaya, but would opt for a different menu choice.  All was well prepared and generously portioned.   The service was a bit stand-offish, but all-in-all I would return.",

But I must admit I have been there several times (at least 3) but most recent was about 4 months ago.  And unfortunately it is tough to recall exatly what was ordered.  I know I know...if I don't remember exactly it must not have been that good.  No!! Just tough to recall all the details!  I do know my date and I started with the Conch Fritters.  Quite good...fried yummies.  I had a salad with pomegranate, pepitas and greens and scallops (I think!!).  I really enjoyed them (honestly).  My date had the Halibut special which was wrapped in plantains.  He is not soo adventurous but he did enjoy his meal.  Great service too...owner/manager (?)/ hostess is very friendly and adds to the relaxed atmosphere.  Next time I am there I will be sure to Yelp sooner!",

    "text": "Came here for a late lunch. A friend told me how much he liked their cuban sandwich is, so I had to try that. For lunch, you can get a 1/2 sandwich with 2 sides, or a full sandwich with 1 side. I decided to get the full sandwich combo (cuban + sweet potato fries) and a cup of their cauliflower & potato soup. Food-wise I'd give everything a solid 3.5*. Everything was tasty, but it just wasn't terribly memorable. Of everything, the sweet potato fries were my favorite. The soup was nicely spiced and not at all heavy. My friend had conch & corn chowder and it didn't look very chowder-like (it was a thinner soup base), but he said it still tasted good. The cuban sandwich was smaller than I expected: the two sandwich halves were cut like strips (instead of two triangles). Nonetheless, I still found the sandwich+soup combo more than filling and even had a bit to take home. What bumps this review up to 4* is the service. It wasn't crowded, so we were seated quickly. The food also came quickly and the waitress was attentive. You really can't ask for too much more service-wise!  Next time I'll try coming back for their dinner menu.",

    "text": "Kaya has great food and a fun atmosphere. It has an active bar and a sort of celebratory vibe, which made it nice for a birthday dinner.  It's vegetarian-friendly, and we've had some very interesting veggie and fish dishes in two visits. I particularly recommend the fish tacos--delicious and reasonably priced.  Other favorites are halibut ceviche and gazpacho. All three dishes taste authentic--well, my version of that anyway. The tacos and ceviche would be right at home in CA.   The fish tacos are really the star though. The spicy creme fraiche sauce on the tacos was so tasty that we went home and tried to imitate it. The taco is a fresh wheat tortilla, an avocado slice, lightly battered fish, cole slaw dressed with lime, and a pink spicy creme fraiche sauce. It all works perfectly together. The acidity of the cole slaw is just perfect. I can't rave about these tacos enough (and I really love tacos).  I also really like the homemade sweet potato chips.  They also have a good variety of wine, beer, and mixed drinks. The mojitos are very good.  Portions are smallish, which I like. I was able to eat my appetizer and 2 of the 3 fish tacos. I really appreciate not having my plate loaded with rice and beans. More stuff I like, no stuff I don't.  I suggest having reservations--we didn't the first time and we waited a while.  They also have a once a month prix fixe vegetarian dinner that we are going to try. It's pricey ($35, with $20 or so extra for wine pairing), but it's really hard to get high quality vegetarian food in a restaurant so we are going to try it.  Incidentally, we liked the fish tacos so much that we made our own version at home (also delicious, but not as perfect). It's rare that a restaurant inspires me to directly copy one of their dishes.",

    "text": "We had a night out without our little one and wanted to try a new place with unique food, so after checking out some reviews, we ended up choosing Kaya. We made reservations for 9pm on a Friday night, and the place still had a lot of diners. One other person noted how close the tables were, and we agree. We were only a foot or two from a couple on their 1st or 2nd date (and were totally amused by their conversations which you couldn't help but overhear due to our proximity), but it also helped to scope out what other people were ordering. All the food looked pretty good.  We ordered the jerk wings and we would absolutely order those again. Very flavorful, hot & fresh, and juicy. The dipping sauce was a welcome change from ranch or blue cheese. For entrees, I had the seared tuna (I think the  most expensive item on the menu) with very flavorful lime-y black beans, another creamy green sauce, and what seemed to be fried plantains. He had the crispy fish tacos, and we both cleaned our plates.  For dessert, we ordered the chocolate chip banana bread pudding, and it was pretty tasty. We have a hard time passing up bread pudding when it's on the menu, even when we're full!  The drinks were interesting. I hadn't ever had a frozen mojito, and I tried their mango version. I don't think I'd get it again, but his rum ginger drink was good.  We would definitely come back and try this again.",

It is a hefty price, but this is the kind of food you want to splurge on. We tried many of their drink specials, all of which are good. The last drink I chose was a margatini (tequila martini-ish) and it was delicious. As for the other drinks, my memory has grown foggy, but I'll update with specifics after my next visit.   The ambiance is great, dark but boldly lively with oranges and reds.  I recently moved back from Pittsburgh, and I was surprised to see the place so quiet on a Friday night. I remember the strip being much more vibrant when I was in high school. I guarantee that this restaurant would have a wait every night of the week in Chicago.",

I love the vibe of this place and they had some of the best sangria I have ever tasted, but came short when it comes to food. If I had even a slightly better meal, I would have bumped the rating up, but unfortunately it wasn't good at all. I went for lunch with co-workers and ordered the Green Vegetable Curry. It was seasoned oddly, and the rice was super salty. The sauce was not really there, leaving dried, weird seasoned vegetables in a heap. I tried working around it but it was such a big pile of food, it was unappetizing. Maybe it's just this dish that's not up to par? Everyone else really loved their food! I also see another review about the curry dish... I am definitely coming back here, hopefully for a better experience!",

    "text": "Another one of my favorites in the Burgh. Kaya has been around for quite a while and it used to be a refueling stop for me on Christmas Eve before diving in with the shopping masses on Penn Avenue.  Their specialty, tropas, tropical tapas, were here way before Ibiza and all of the other tapas bars in town caught on with the idea of serving little dishes. Although, the tropas menu has been substantially reduced from Kaya's glory days, there are still some tasty treats on the menu.   The tuna tataki (or whatever it's called) - sashimi tuna, seaweed, sesame seed, all chopped up and marinated in a soy-based sauce, served cold and with some crackers is great. I also like the conch fritters; and the tofu cracklins - deep fried tofu served with a sweet, chipotle sauce (a little too sweet and not spicy enough for me - nowhere near the heat of mapo doufu - but it is good nevertheless).  I have never tried any of their main dishes...so I can't comment on them. It's usually 3-4 tropas between me and the mrs.",

    "text": "I kinda went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. You see when we were entering the restaurant, a number of young men in track suits were leaving.   The decor was surprisingly not as tacky as I imagined it would be and the service at the bar was very good. We did have to wait longer for our reservation. It was a laid back atmosphere with excellent service.   As far as food goes, I would lean toward the seafood dishes and getting a number of small plates. They are also excellent about splitting entrees for you. Of the small plates, I particularly like the tuna poke. The enchiladas are just okay, but their dipping sauce is very good. The lamb and cockles were very good. Eastern Shore Sea Scallops, Mussels and Littleneck clams was excellent. Crispy duck breast, creamy cornmeal grits, charred mustard greens, chili gastrique was good, but I found the sauce a bit on the salty side. Portions are quite generous.   As far as desserts, the creme brulee was the best. The bread pudding okay, but a bit too egg-y. The chocolate cake was meh. The texture was too dense and dry. I think they need to soak the cake in rum.   Wine selection was a bit disappointing. I would have like to see some South African wines considering that this is a African / Carribean fusion theme restaurant. Though I had a glass of the Carmenere and it was quite good.   Overall, I was quite pleased with the place. It would be nice for a date. It is a bit spendy on a grad student salary. It came to approximately $200 for the 4 of us with a couple drinks each, tax + tip.",

The side salad has some good garlicky sauce. One day...I went to pick up an order and the bartender was awesomely engaging. He could tell I was having a rough one because I looked REAL frazzled.

I ended up splitting a carafe of Red Sangria with a friend which was good and nice to sip on. Although it only had apples in it but oh well. The table ordered 2 orders of the Jerk wings and I was able to try one. It was crispy and delicious and the Cilantro cream sauce was so so good. For entrees the table ordered Fish Tacos, Green Vegetable Curry, a Kaya Burger, and the Grilled Salmon salad. I had the tacos which were really good and with 3 tacos I was able to take one home for lunch. I tried the Green Vegetable Curry that was on the sweet side that I wasn't expecting but a nice dish.

A better version of their fish tacos can be purchased for 50% less at the Penn Avenue Fish Company a few blocks away.  Did you ever notice that all of Big Burrito's restaurants (aside from the Mad Mex chain) get in the Top 25 every year.  With Kaya being in it that makes me question the \"purity\" of the list.",

I could always count on delicious vegetarian meals, like the spectacular risotto with a fried egg on top, the green Jamaican curry, and the egg and avocado torta. The appetizers were also top notch, especially the lentil and corn beignets (don't try to tackle these on your own, though -- there's more than enough to share with about 4 people) and the tofu cracklins.   The service was always great and the servers were genuinely excited about the food being served -- and were happy to share their favorites, or steer you away from a choice that may not be quite as good.   The meat-eaters who I dined with were incredibly impressed with the double cut pork chop, and the fish tacos (a friend, also from California, said they were the best she'd ever tasted).   The atmosphere is funky, and the prices are very reasonable, too. Definitely worth a visit!",

There is a bar up front where you can order a margarita and just hang out, and table service in the back. Make sure you try the plaintain appetizer-- very tasty.  What I didn't like was the dim lighting.  It works fine in most restaurants, but this place was wayy too dark.  Wish I could've seen my food better. (It was my first time trying Carribean).",

The food, meanwhile, has always been great. The tomato torta this time of year is by far my favorite light dinner - generous slices of heirloom tomato with two big zucchini and goat cheese pancakes?

    "text": "If this restaurant were a boat, they'd have forgotten to put a \"k\" on the end of their name.  Happily, however, this restaurant is not a boat.  It's a restaurant.  (I may now refer to myself as Captain Obvious in the third person for the rest of this review.)  Captain Obvious went to lunch at Kaya.  She ordered the following menu items: 1.  A glass of red sangria, 2. a cup of gazpacho verde 3. a small isabeleta(?) and monchego grilled sandwich with lime oil, arugula and some other item in there of which Captain Obvious does not recall the name.  The sandwich came with two sides.  Captain Obvious chose the spicy slaw and petite salad.   Considering that an appetizer and meal generally is generally a overzealous amount of food, I... I mean Captain Obvious... was very please with the portion sizes.  They were mid-sized, reasonably small, yet still big (go figure that out) portions of delicious.  The sandwich and gazpacho were particularly delish.  Delish dish! (Say that 10 times fast). The side salads were nice, but they were side salads aka somewhat boring. The Sangria... well perhaps they should rename it Saintgria, because it was heavenly.  Actually, it might have been a touch too sweet, but I liked saying that.  It was good in any case.  One downside was the the service was kinda slow... It took a long time for the waitress to get us our drinks and apps (which considering that they were just soup should have been easy to maneuver). The entrees came perhaps a bit to quick.  Time is always of the essence, so that could be worked on.    In addition, the chairs... ugh... who designed those?  Clearly, they never sat in them, because they weren't great for posture or comfort and, let's face it, chairs should meet one of those two basic needs at very least. Let this be a lesson to you all:  Sit in every chair you design before finalizing plans.  (Captain Obvious design chairs ALLLL the time - don't you?)   In all though, Captain Obvious did like the place and mmm to the food.",

I ordered an orange juice to start. It may have been 5 o'clock somewhere but not for me. As I looked over the menu, I saw some really interesting options. Most seemed to be with a Caribbean flare. Then my eyes wondered to nearby tables. Are you kidding me! The portions were gigantic. Was this brunch or dinner? I don't think the kitchen realized it was before noon. Accordingly, there were lots of tables with to go boxes. I decided to go with the chicken and waffles. I recognized that I was taking a risk here. I'm much more of a sweet brunch person than a savory one. When our meals arrived, I dug in. The fried chicken was spectacular as it always is. The waffle was light and fluffy. But somehow the combination was off to me. Maybe it was the tabasco butter mixing with the sweet syrup. Sweet and savory failed to come together for me. I ate the chicken separately and left the waffle. Should have stayed in my comfort zone and went with the chocolate banana waffle. Oh well, I think I'll stick with Kaya for dinner.",

No thanks on the wait, we were starving!  We were seated immediately, and brought drinks. The bloody marys were a little spicy, but the waiter had warned us (and thoughtfully gave us a glass of tomato juice to cut them). We ordered sweet potato fries as an appetizer, and they were honestly some of the best I've ever had. The chipotle mayo dip for the fries was really good too.  We each had a benedict for our entree, I had the pulled pork one and my friend had the smoked salmon. I liked their take on the benedict, with corn bread as the base, and the slightly sweet/spicy hollandaise. Our benedicts came with grilled pineapple and potatoes.   Overall, I was very happy with our experience at Kaya. The one ding I would give it is because the service was slow, but the food was great. If I'm ever back in Pittsburgh, I would visit this restaurant again.",

    "text": "My first trip to Kaya was out of sheer Monday night dinner desperation.  Having found that our first two restaurant choices were closed, my boyfriend and I headed aimlessly toward the Strip District.  We were both getting pretty hungry and frustrated at this point (our fault...should have used the mobile Yelp app to look up restaurant hours!).  We'd both heard good things about Kaya, so we decided to give it a shot.  We arrived right in time for Happy Hour (5-7pm, Monday thru Friday).  I promptly ordered a pomegranate martini...good flavor, but I found it to be a little weak.  My boyfriend and I were able to grab two seats at the bar, so we decided to order our food there as opposed to waiting 30-45 mins for a table.  I went with the Jamaican Green Curry Vegetables, while my boyfriend ordered the Fish Tacos.  By this time, the Happy Hour crowd had begun to clear out, and our food arrived quickly.  I really enjoyed my Jamaican green curry.  It had a much different flavor than the green curry I typically order at Thai restaurants, but was very tasty.  It was served with some fluffy saffron rice.  The bf loved his crispy fish tacos, which was great because the portion size was large.  I tried a bite myself and had a bit of food envy.  Next time!  I found Kaya to be my favorite of the Big Burrito restaurants that I've been to.  I can't wait to go back and sample a few more items from the menu.  Although my boyfriend and I had been tired and frustrated when we first walked in the door, we found that our mood had been greatly improved by our overall experience here.  Thanks Kaya!",

    "text": "Conch fritters. That's really all I have to say. At Kaya, they're the best I've ever had. Kaya is a member of the Big Burrito group who also owns Mad Mex, Eleven, and several other places around the 'Burgh. Kaya has Mad Mex Prices with Eleven-level food. It's really fantastic.   The place is cozy and full of Island flavor from the tiki-looking statues in the corners to the tile decor. Surprisingly, given the amount of area covered in tile, it's not cold or uninviting in the winter. You can also choose to eat outside during good weather, but something caused their outdoor tabletops to warp slightly so keeping a drink upright is sometimes challenging.   Their menu is fantastic. Among the winners are the Kaya Burger, the Crispy Fish Tacos and the Conch Fritters. The salad that comes with is also amazingly good. Something about the lemony garlic dressing... I would eat the side salad alone as a meal given the chance, it's just that good.   When they serve chips, they're taro chips that feel (and probably are) home made.   The service is always great, and their bartenders really know how to mix their drinks. Though the place is somewhat small - maybe 30 tables or so - I have never had a problem getting seated except when we went there for dinner on a fried chicken Thursday. I didn't know it was a \"thing\" and the wait would have been so long that we decided to find other food.   Overall, Kaya remains one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "Ok I've been to Kaya a few times, my review comes about 40 minutes from leaving there. First off  1.BEST MOJITOS IN TOWN.... its hard to find a bar in these parts familiar with the Mo, let alone that it should be served with fresh mint, muddled with simple syrup and the right kind of Rum. Kaya does not fail here.   2. Jerk chicken wings, pulled pork Quesadilla, and calamari are lovely, I am not overly familiar with this cuisine. But I feel like they hit the right mix of flavors here a little spice, a little peanut, sometimes coconut mixed in. Nothing overly done. I've also tried the Jerk tofu tacos, nice and still flavorful for the vegan or vegetarian.   3. Best Customer Service, so I ate there with a friend tonight, who can be picky. She first asked for the jerk tofu done as jerk chicken tacos, A dish not on their menu but they accommodated. The chicken in the tacos was blackened, as Jerk meat often is she did not care for it. She asked for the wings, they came back and she again felt they were burnt although she began eating them anyway, when the waitress asked how were they? I promptly ordered another drink thinking I was settling in for a long night. My friend replied she felt they were burn but i could see the meat was tender, and why would she eat one if they were burnt?   Again the kitchen and wait staff accommodated and brought her a dish of her choice, she went with creme brulee. Then out of the blue the manager who had already once rushed to her unsatisfied side, said they would be picking up our tab. This was not necessary as we told them we were happy with the rest of the food we ordered and we would be back. We put our cash together for a tip for the waitress and thanked them again.   I feel guilty for my free meal i completely enjoyed and would have paid for, Kaya I will be back and not just for your fabulous Mojitos and excellent customer service.",

    "text": "After attending an event in the Strip, I decided to get a bite to eat with a fellow attendee.   We weren't looking for anything too formal, but were interested in getting some quality fare.  I had been to Kaya many years ago, and remembered having a good experience, so we stopped in.  It was a warm summer evening, and many hungry patrons were seated outside enjoying tropical drinks.  It was quite warm, so we chose to sit inside.  The interior at Kaya is festive.  The walls were covered with warm tropical colors, and the tile on the bar was in a mosaic pattern.  The entryway and front end of the restaurant are narrow, so we had to be careful while we were being shown to our table.  We ordered a Corona (with lime) and white sangria- both drinks adequately quenched out thirsts as we looked over the menu.  The food at Kaya is described as island fare.  I immediately chose the Tuna Tartare (11.00) as an appetizer.  We also wanted to try the Conch Fritters ($9.00) with tropical tartar sauce.   Other starters included Salmon Crab Cakes with Jalapeno Remoulade ($9.00), Sweet and Spicy Baby Back Ribs ($11.00), Crisp Calamari ($9.00), and Blue Bay Mussels ($10.00).  The tuna tartare arrived first and was served with poblano, scallion, avocado, lime, chile oil, crema, and large curly bands of deep-fried bananas.  The tuna was perfectly fresh and buttery.  The scallions and chile oil added necessary heat to the mild, raw fish.  Oily chunks of ripe avocado provided texture, and taste balance.  Placing large scoops of the tuna, crema, and cilantro on the crispy banana proved to be particularly scrumptious.  The conch fritters arrived looking a little over-cooked.  After a few bites, I concluded that the quality of the dish was suffering from some aged fryer oil.   That being said, the battered treat was flavorful and crisp.  The tropical tartar sauce helped cool down the fritters, and enhanced the soft flavors.  Our entrees were served immediately after our appetizer plates were cleared.    Since our bellies were quickly becoming full, we would split the Crispy Fish Tacos ($17.00).  One of the reasons I chose the fish tacos, is because the tortillas on which they are served are provided by Reyna's.  Reyna's is a small Mexican food outlet that provides authentic food products.  They're famous for having hard to find items like real enchilada sauce (Las Palmas), homemade salsas, and even Mexican jumping beans!  Our fish tacos arrived on two separate plates (a kind gesture considering I asked if we could share an entree- restaurants frown upon this).  The flour tortillas were grilled, and stuffed with corn meal coated fried tilapia.  Also inside were cabbage slaw, avocado, spicy creme fraiche, and cilantro.  The tacos were amazing- the fish was perfectly cooked, and the soft, doughy tortillas were warm and chewy.  The shredded cabbage slaw was seasoned, and tart; it added a nice crunch to the dish.  Silky creme fraiche and perfectly matured avocado slices concluded the flavor-festival.     Kaya is a great place to go for a meal.  Not only does it have a festive atmosphere, the food is excellent.",

We had the same waiter we have had the past few times we have eaten there over the past 3 years and the service was as good as ever. We ordered a FEAST. The waiter had several \"courses\" brought out to us so we could pace ourselves (and have space on the table). We first got the Fundido and the Yuca Bean Dip. Both were fantastic. The fundido was creamy with a good spice and little bit of sweet from the onions with a great cheesy flavor. The yuca dip was a perfect spicy, bean compilation that always has been good. Next, we got the crab cakes and calamari which were both good. The crab cakes had a refreshing salsa on top that balanced the heaviness of the cake well. The calamari also had good zest, as well as fried jalapenos which are always a plus. Next, we got our conch hush puppies and the jerk wings. The jerk wings are possibly my favorite with a great crunch, delicious lime sauce, and tender chicken. The conch hush puppies were good as well but they were filling especially towards the end of the huge meal. They were also surprisingly spicy. The final thing we got was a fried chicken sandwich that we took to go since we had to go to PNC Park. It was delicious (better than chik-fil-a and I love those sandwiches). It was perfectly crunchy with a bit of spice and tender chicken. Perfect meal.",

Loved the Carribean theme, its something we don't have in Philly.  We started with some of the house tropical cocktails and an order of the Jamaican jerk  wings, which were possibly the best wings I have ever had. The wings were large, juicy and spicy and the cilantro sauce tasted so good with them.   There are plenty of wings on the plate and more than enough for 2 to share.  The salads were also terrific, we had the grilled peach salad with herbs, blueberries and spicy peppers, I loved this combination. The heirloom tomato salad was also amazing.  For entrees, we had the crispy whole porgie which a whole porgie with a crispy fried coating and inside the meat was tender and delicious. Worth having to deal with the bones etc.  The Jamaica Green curry vegetables was good and spicy, I had it with shrimp but you can also get it as a vegetarian entree.  Service and atmosphere, great. Overall, a fun casual place to eat with well prepared, interesting food. Would return!",

My wife ordered the fish tacos. They were large and very fresh but covered in a little too much creme freche.  I had the green curry with shrimp. I did not care for this at all. It was too oniony and too citrussy. Coffee was superb. Dessert was lava cake with vanilla ice cream. This was very good. I must have ordered the wrong thing.  The green curry does not taste like it's Thai counterpart. But the vibe is so good I will have to return. I will order the cuban sandwich, Paella or jerked chicken when next time.",

The kamayan meal is a traditional Filipino meal served family style on bamboo leaves and meant to be eaten using your hands. It did not disappoint.  Kaya took creative license to modernize the dishes a bit. For example, they made ribs with a banana ketchup barbecue sauce. The chicken adobo utilized chicken wings. The beef bistek was perfectly seasoned and the fish was cooked to perfection.  I docked a star for two dishes that were just okay: the mussels and the shrimp. Both were flavorless. But don't let these two dishes ruin the experience for you! The meal was overkill--definitely a lot for three people and a great value for $35/person.",

Some nights I'll get a delicious spread that I eat until I think my pants aren't going to button the next day and other nights I'll get somewhat 'okay' food. I've had mixed drinks before and they're strong- like no mixer strong. Which is fine if you're wanting to get wrecked but not fine if you plan on drinking it with your meal.   The service varies according to what waiter you get. I've had some great service there but I've also had to literally chase down a waiter before in order to even get our order taken. They are pretty quick with getting food out and are on time with reservations, which is nice.   The Kaya burger is delicious, but be prepared to eat it with a fork and knife. It's soggy as all get out but it's a delicious kind of soggy.",

The bottom of the bun was deteriorated by the time I got it. I tried the fork and knife approach, but they serve it on wax paper, so now I have wax paper in my food. TIp: If you order the burger, get them to put it on a normal plate, and put the sauce or whater it is on the side.  Also, for some reason, the mixed drinks were not good at all. I got the \"Tiki #7,\" which really tasted like frozen juice concentrate (just bitter sour and lots of acid. I sent it back and got a \"Mojito\" which was basically a mixer with mint leaves on top. Not great.",

    "text": "This is one of the overall best restaurants in Pittsburgh for three reasons:   1) The appetizers. If they have it on the menu, as some items are seasonal, the spicy tuna poke bowl is a MUST TRY. The tuna was clearly fresh, the dish wasn't smothered in spicy mayo like a regular tuna roll might be, and it was overall delicious. It had me and the person I was eating with literally scraping up single grains of rice to finish off. 2) The drinks. They have a really fresh and innovative cocktail menu and a pretty good wine list as well. I had the rum punch, and it was very very good. 3) Fried chicken Thursdays. This was the reason we were there on a Thursday night. They have fried chicken plates every Thursday, and it is very very good. Upon being seated, we were told they were out of the fried chicken and I was disappointed, so it might be worth it to go a little earlier in the night if you're really interested. However, they still had the fried chicken sandwiches, and I got the spicy chicken version which was truly delicious. It was crispy and perfectly spicy, I would definitely recommend it.   A little tip, the waffle fries are AMAZING.",

    "text": "On my epic voyage to Pittsburgh we had had friends take us via car (fancy) to a little district called the Strip. It's a unique, thriving little area that has definitely developed over the past few years. My sister says it was a completely different place ten years ago. You'll see vendors with fresh produce, breads, meats, cheeses, flowers, etc. Free samples from restaurants. Antiquing galore. I was digging it. Then we stopped in this restaurant to regroup everyone together for a drink and lunch.   I wasn't particularly starving so opted to split a dish with my sister. It was a vegetable Paella and it was most def. pretty delicious. There were chunks of fresh zucchini, pineapple, peas, carrots and melded well together. If I were more hungry I would have totally got this SUPER DELICIOUS looking slow cooked pork sandwich with banana! The guy across from me was eating it and he looked like he was creaming his pants over it. He said the banana and pork just melted together. A few people got the non-vegetarian paella, which looked better but more filling: chorizo, chicken, mussels, shrimp, scallops. A full freaking meal. They enjoyed it. Someone else had fish tacos and they looked supreme.   Drinks were pretty tasty too. I had a fancy mango mai tai. Only complaint is really the price for their cocktails is a little up there. $10 for a drink that was exceptionally fruity and not very strong is very New York. I was hoping for something very Pittsburgh. Second complaint is that the bathroom was a little way too dark. I almost couldn't find the toilet paper after coming in from the glaring sun to a low red lit bathroom. But that's not a biggie. This is a solid restaurant.",

The tortillas are apparently Reyna's tortillas which is the taco stand down the street which means they're freshly made corn tortillas. The tacos are a bit on the pricey end for the size of the tacos. $17 for three fish tacos.  The burger is probably worth more the price of $12. It's topped with all my favorite condiments: pickles, sunnyside up egg, avocado, tomato, and bacon. Also comes with Kaya chips which seems to be a mixture of potato chips and plantain chips.  My only complaint is the way they handle seating and reservations. It's pretty hard to come here without a reservation. Even if the restaurant is empty you might not be able to get in without a reservation.  They did accommodate us this one time when we had an extra person than what we originally said when we made a reservation. They seated us at a larger table but told us we had to finish within an hour or so. That was enough time and it was nice of them to allow us to switch tables rather than turn us away.",

Been going here for years and have pretty much had everything on the menu and there is NOTHING I wouldn't order again! That good. Service is always superb (well, we had one visit when it was subpar but Monika the General Manager showed how much customer service means to them and took care of things for us! She's amazing!).   Starters for us always include the spicy bean dip or the lentil and corn beignets. Amazing. The greeny curry sauce for the beignets is the perfect complement to a superb dish! The conch fritters are not something you see elsewhere in the Burgh and worth a try! Entrees are spectacular and range from  crispy fish tacos with cabbage slaw (Highly recommended!) to jerk pulled pork quesadillas with that yummy jerked flavor, to specials like barramundi (which might have been the best fish dish I've had in years!) and skirt steak so tender it melts in your mouth.  And with all the burger talk in the city, don't sell Kaya short in that category! Oh no! The Kaya burger may be the best burger offering out there!! The juicy, perfectly cooked burger topped with fresh avocado, fried egg, Kaya sauce and whatever mystical ingredients they supplement it with is enough to make me dream of burgers! I've even ordered it for brunch! Yeah, I know - so good. The salmon eggs benedict for brunch is killer. KILLER!   And let's talk about alcohol, shall we? Happy hour cocktails and beer are half off. Cocktails are imaginative and super tasty. And the draft beer selection is among the best around! Huge selection of craft beers that rotate frequently. May be in the top two happy hours I've ever been too.   Love the atmosphere, the food, and the beer. I will keep coming back. And with a freee entree on my birthdays, here's hoping I'll be there for a long, long time!!",

We've done brunch, dinners & even one of their special theme dinners over the years and I've got to put several of their dishes up there with some of the best food I've ever had: the jumbo lump crab omelette on a Mother's Day Brunch that had more crab than most lump crabmeat dinners & the crab and avocado appetizer served during their Creole themed dinner were standouts I will never forget, ever! Yeah, I really love crab and theirs was fresh and perfect! And silly as it may sound I had coconut grits as a side with a recent brunch that I can't stop thinking about. Who but Kaya could give you a side dish like that?   Delightful standbys as starters include the Yucatan hot bean dip, the ridiculously delicious tofu cracklins (and I'm not even a tofu fan but those converted me) or the lentil and corn beignets.  You can't go wrong ordering any of their lovingly and creatively prepared fish dishes, the fish or jerked tofu tacos or the Jamaican green curry vegetables with the black tiger shrimp. Lots of my family members love both the Kaya burger and the veggie Kaya burger. Personally there are too many other fun things on their menu for me to consider a burger.  Their Happy Hour half priced drink menu is also delightful! The grapefruit basil margarita calls my name regularly!  Service is typically a standout and on the rare occasion (1time) that it wasn't, their manager made sure we felt the Kaya love even more in the way she treated us. Phenomenal!!!!",

Our only complaint was it then took a good 40 min for our entree to come after that. A lot of people around us that came in well after us had received their entrees before us. Not sure what was going on because we didn't order intense entrees. My husband got the green curry vegetables and I ordered the fish tacos. Both were good. No complaints besides the fact that it took forever to get our entree.",

    "text": "Stop everything you're doing and think about the last time you had a cemita.  An egg-based bread bun, rolled in sesame seeds. Cut in half and decorated with marinated (or grilled) meat (or meat alternative). Topped with a white, stringy, Mexican cheese. Adorned with avocado, onion, tomato, salsa roja (sometimes also a spicy creamy sauce), and papalo (an herb somewhere between cilantro and arugula). To dismiss a cemita as a torta is blasphemy; to enjoy a cemita is an understatement.  The cemita is elusive in the United States. Primarily found in NYC and LA, we rarely see the sandwich spread its wings beyond the most well-known of cities. Okay, okay, okay, now for the best part: Kaya has the best (i.e. only) cemita in Pittsburgh.  My unhealthy obsession for cemitas aside, Kaya is a pretty nice place for any time of dressy-casual. Great for date nights, sharing a few plates, brunch that isn't Ritter's, celebratory happy hours, and just about any other occasion you can suggest. The service can sometimes be a bit slow, but they do a great job for nearly always being packed. The menu isn't perfect, but there's always something to enjoy--the fish tacos, the mango salsa, but honestly why wouldn't you get a cemita and then another cemita to go and then a third cemita to ship out to your mother.  Other notes: Thursday night is fried chicken night. The Kaya Burger is one of the best in Pittsburgh (close second to the Pub Burger at Meat and Potatoes). They make a stellar bloody mary with some jalapeno-infused booze.",

    "text": "Happy birthday to me. I was taken here for my birthday dinner by two of my work friends. I have not been here in a really long time. I always enjoyed their food and their drinks so I was happy that it was suggested.   We made reservations, but were an hour late due to the rainstorm. They still had room for us and were so nice about it. We started with the Yucatan Hot Bean Dip and the Mussels. The bean dip was amazing. The chips were fresh and warm and the dip had a great taste to it. Yum. The Mussels were my pick and they were just ok. The sauce was amazing, we were even dipping our chips from the bean dip into the sauce. The mussels were too small.  I love mussels and I am not saying that I am someone who really knows all about mussels but these were really little and about half of the mussels were empty.   For my dinner I ordered the Tropical Paella. It had chicken, chorizo, shrimp, scallops, mussels, peas, pineapples, and red peppers.  I love paella. This had a nice good taste to it but it had too much tomato and it overtook the dish. I did not see/taste any scallops which to me would mean that they were so small that I couldn't detect them. The pineapples were not overbearing and they were a nice added ting of sweetness. The mussels also were the same as the appetizer, small and sad. Overall the meal was really nice and I enjoyed it.   I enjoyed the food. I enjoyed my drink. I enjoyed the experience.",

    "text": "Kaya is another offering from Big Burrito and if you're familiar with their other restaurants (especially Mad Mex), you'll know what to expect from the vibe. It's a pretty dark space, heavily style with an island flair...both in decor and menu. The menu is pretty small, but all of the items that I've tried have been pretty good, and the service has always been really good, whether sitting inside or outside.  We absolutely love their black bean dip, but fair warning: it's pretty spicy if you're not good with heat. The burger is good, as well as the cuban sandwich, but my go-to is probably the fish tacos. I tend to think they overdo it on the cream sauce, but otherwise, they're excellent. The red sangria is also delicious! I wouldn't say the food will blow you away, but I doubt you'll be disappointed, either.  It's warm vibe and good service means it's good for both casual meals and for a nice date night spot. The strip district can be insane at times, so while you may have luck grabbing a table or seats at the bar on a whim, I'd advice making a reservation to save yourself a wait. Enjoy!",

There have been some hits and misses for me on their food but that's okay with me.  I went to their pre fix vegan meal in October. They do this once a month. You are presented with a menu that has a vegan option or a vegetarian option for each course including dessert. You can choose all vegan, all vegetarian or switch it up for each course. I ordered all vegan dishes. Each course was delicious and worth the price. Although, sometimes I enjoyed the garnish more than the meal! For example, the roasted acorn squash dumplings didn't have much flavor but the pearl onions and braised cabbage was melt in your mouth heaven! I'd love to go back for another of Kaya's veggie dinners!",

I ordered the tropical paella, but rest of the fam also ordered their conch appetizers, their Kaya burger, jerk chicken torts, and a few other items.  What's hot - Quality.  My paella was delish.  Good amount of seafood- mussels, shrimp, scallops, and shrimps.  Definitely added to the flavor.  The Kaya burger was a good size portion, with sauce that dropped off the sides, melted cheese, a fried egg, etc...  No complaints from our family on the quality of the food. - Menu variety.  There are vegetarian options and vegan options.  Great that they take into consideration different dietary options. - Service.  Good service and attentive.  However, they don't look like they have enough staff to handle a full restaurant.  We were there past noon, so it wasn't a busy time.    What's not  - Layout/space.  This place isn't conducive for groups.  If your group is more than 4, be aware they'll be pushing tables together.  Their space/overall restaurant layout is also tight. - Price.  Generally less than $20 per person, but more than $10.  Not too expensive, but not cheap. - Portions.  Small portions, not huge.  It may not be enough to get you full.  Good chance you'll still want more food.  Final answer Willing to come back, but not my first choice.",

You get great coupons for your birthday. It is small and the bar area itself was packed (difficult to walk by) but we were able to get a table right away.  We started with grapefruit margaritas. It's a delicious drink with fresh garnish. It's light and refreshing. I would say regular price ($12) is a bit high for what you get, but happy hour ($6) is definitely worth it.  Next we had the Carribean Rainbow Salad, which is always good. It has way too many ingredients to list but it all comes together. Just squeeze the lime over the top and mix everything together for a very flavorful and filling salad. Personally I'm not an avocado fan but my boyfriend is happy to eat all of it.  Finally we had the roasted cauliflower and carrot paella with crispy tofu. This was my first time trying this and I was not disappointed. All the spices give it a good burst of flavor and the blend of vegetables all worked well together. You get a pretty large portion. My only complaint, though minor, was that the cauliflower was in such huge chunks. My favorite bites were when I got a little bit of everything together, so I tried to cut the cauliflower to match the size of everything else.  Waitress was attentive. She kept checking in and stayed on top of refilling our water glasses. It was an enjoyable night out an I am sure we will be back again.",

We had to ask for our drink orders to be taken at which time we put an app in.    Then we did not see him for 20 min.  The bartender brought our drinks over.  They had seated people next to us and those people actually left bc no one came to their table at all after seating.  Bc we had been there so long we started timing things, and it was a full 45 minutes before our food came out (a chicken sandwich and a burrito).  If you can get it to your table, the food is good.  The atmosphere is stressful; loud inside, everyone sits in a long hall or a few tables in the back.  I honestly dont think I'll be back.  For me, Kaya is not a destination restaurant anymore.  Its always crowded and more trouble than its worth.",

From its unique interior design and friendly wait staff to its amazing food and drink selection, Kaya has it all. I spoke with a coworker who said their \"Veggie Burrito\" offered only during the Sunday brunch was the best meal she's ever had. I had to try it, and I was, too, blown away. I've got to admit, I think the Kaya burger takes the cake. The meat was so tender that you had to eat the burger with a fork and knife.  Overall, I am a 5 star fan of Kaya, and I will definitely be back to try more of their exotic menu!",

What I liked about the todo en uno is 1) the variety of dishes it incorporates and 2) it's plenty of food for lunch. Hubby had the Cuban sandwich with waffle fries and a hefty \"side\" salad. I opted for the black bean and pineapple quesadilla, which comes with mango salsa, paired with sweet potato fries (spicy aioli!), and a really hot delicious conch and corn chowder. We both took some food home as leftovers. I would order that again, but there are so many other items I would like to try! Finally, I had heard that they serve Caribbean-style food, but the statuary in the restaurant definitely looks African to me. The rest of the decor is appropriate, especially the really pretty sea life mosaics on the floor.",

This was the most unique salad I have ever ordered and it did not disappoint.  Although; for lunch, with the  added salmon, it was pricey(+$20), I will say it was that delicious , I would splurge again.   They had a a variety of carribean cocktails on the menu that looked very good.  Since my husband and I are partaking in dry January, it was so nice to choose from non-alcoholic unique beverages as well.  The sorrel tea was excellent.  We really enjoyed Kaya.  It is really convenient they take open table reservations as well!",

To the barstools and the floor tiles to the walls and decor, it's so cute in here!  Next, onto their perfectly perfected cocktails. We had a variety across the table and everyone loved every sip!  For the table we had a couple of apps. The shishito peppers were my favorite, not too spicy and perfectly charred/grilled. Whatever the topping was, I could literally eat it with a spoon it was so good! We also had the chips and dip which were spicy, yet tasty! We also tried the jerk chicken wings, they said they were pretty good as well.  For my dinner I had the tempura avocado tacos. I was a little curious to see how fried avocado would be but - YAS AMAZING! I wish I had more!!!  My husband had the burger, he said it was a little sloppy but overall pretty good, did not knock his sock off as recommended.  I wish we had dessert, but sadly they had no vegan friendly options, which was actually really surprising.  I wish I could remember our server's name, he was awesome! Very polite, helpful and overall a bomb server!  I need to come back ASAP!!!",

We started our foodie experience ordering the Jerked Pork and Plantain nachos and their Yucatan hot bean dip.  Both of these appetizers are recommended but the Plantain nachos were great!  I ordered their Tropical Paella that had a large quantity of mussels, shrimp, chicken and chorizo.  The dish was very good, but I have had paella in a number of places including Spain and was not the best, but I expect you maybe hard pressed to find better in.Pittsburg. My wife enjoyed her Chili Rellenos they were tasty and well presented.  Note - They have a good bread pudding if you have room for dessert.    Food 4 - Excellent starters definitely go with Jerk Chicken Nachos. The Tropical Paella is Very good as well.

The plan of the field trip was to introduce inner city youths to tropical/exotic cuisine. That field trip left a huge impression on me. I have now been dinning at Kaya's for over 11 years!    Crispy Fish Tacos are excellent and bright and flavorful.  A meal that picks you up and give you energy, instead of bogging you down.  Kaya's keeps it genuine to the Caribbean isles.   They do remove and add menu option frequently, one of my favorite menu items was the paelle. There is a lobster tail served right in with the sausage , chicken , muscles and clams.",

Awkwardly, we saw the same hostess and the powers must have been with us because they sat us at the same table.   Between all of us we tried several of the dishes including the Tuna Tartar with plantains, Calamari, Fish Tacos and pulled pork quesadilla. I enjoyed everything. The tuna tartar was massive and fresh. Calamari was good. It had peanuts, coconut and was served with a jicama and apple salad that complemented it well. Fish tacos were good (not the best I've ever had) but I would not hesitate to order it again if the craving it and the pulled pork quesadilla was delicious (very very very porky and meaty). The quesadilla looked more like a sandwich because it was so thick.   Drinks were also excellent. I tried the Kaya-Chelada and loved it. It was not a traditional Chelada but it was a corona mixed with rum and lime. Had a sip of the mojito which was also excellent. Drinks were very strong.   The next day we did some sight seeing and then at noon found ourselves starving. We had seen some people order the Kaya burger the night before.....and wow that was a sight. This was something we needed to try before leaving Pittsburgh.   The Kaya Burger was delicious and messy. It was a thick burger stacked with an egg sunny side up, bacon, cheese, all the fixings and came with sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were perfectly salty and crispy.  It was a delicious pig out.   My friend had a bloody mary that was delicious and spicy. I don't even like vodka or tomato juice that much!   Service was excellent and prompt and the surrounding area has some fun bars and clubs just down one block.",

The decor is neat and the hostess was nice.  Our waitress was kind of odd and I didn't think she was listening half the time.  We tried the conch hushpuppies that were really good (I hate seafood and I loved them).  The sauces with them were amazing.  My husband got the flanksteak with yucca cakes.  It was also cooked very well and tasted great.  I got the burger, mostly because I saw someone else and it looked tasty.   It is a large burger (too big to eat without a fork and knife) and and it comes with a medley of root vegetable chips (but I asked for waffle fries).  My burger was burnt to a CRISP and tasted like it was on a charcoal grill too long.  I loved the sauce, but the waitress forgot to put in the waffle fries so I got the chips.  She did fix it when I brought it to her attention but then I got 1/3 of a tasting cup of ketchup which I thought was kind of strange.  So....  there were definite highlights (appetizer and my husband's meal) but my burger and the waitress was much to be desired.  Food prices seems on par with the other big burrito restaurants (so pricey but you get a good amount of food).",

I had the Atwater Java Vanilla Porter and it was rather delicious, maybe if anything there was almost too much smoothness.  I then tried the Rum Runner which didn't really have all the flavors listed on the menu.  Their Dark & Stormy was the best drink out of the three.

There's just something about the place as a whole that they are infatuated with. This could speak well for Kaya. Maybe they have the whole package??? My numerous experiences there over the years haven't impressed me the same. It is a fun spot to go to. There's something about saying you're going to Kaya that sparks up a little excitement in you. I'm not sure what that comes from. The food I think is way over priced. I've had their fish tacos, some kind of pork they swear by, and a quesadilla. Everything was good each time I've been there, but nothing to write home about. The interior is unique and a cool spot to hang out with friends for appetizers and some drinks. Maybe that's the source of the Kaya-love?",

    "text": "This is without a doubt one of my favorite restaurants. If you like fish tacos, then you won't want another one after eating here. There is something about these tacos that I just fell in love with. The portion is so huge that I always take half of them home with me.   I love Kaya because it is laid back enough that you can go in jeans and a jersey or you can go a little more dressy. It is a cool and comfortable vibe there and just another notch on the belt of the wonderful restaurants in the Big Burrito Group.  The corn beignets are to die for and are paired so well with the curry sauce. Everything that I have had here has not been a disappointment. The desserts and drinks and slightly cheaper than Eleven down the street and the entrees are more reasonably priced.  However, you do not lose the flavor in these dishes with the decrease in price.   Go here! You will love it!",

It has a great ambiance to it.  Nicely stocked bar, great service  I ordered Jerk chicken wings.  Huge chicken wings with a cool dipping sauce on the side...great start to a huge meal.  I washed down my wings with a Cuban sandwich.  Lots of taste to this thing.  Beats a sandwich with French fries on it any day.  Reasonable prices, food seems fresh and its in a great area.",

Kaya has a lower price range but I still don't think the food is worth the amount they charge here. I had the conch chowder, which was fantastic, and the crispy fish tacos. The tacos were huge - I will give them that - but they were mostly packed with cabbage and impossible to eat without making a mess. I am a very experienced taco-eater and know some taco-eating tricks, but I tried just about everything including using silverware, and was quite unsuccessful. I was also bummed that they took the coconut milk cocktail off the menu - that was my favorite summertime cocktail in all of Pittsburgh. Oh well!",

Excellent flavor. Hot, crisp on the outside, soft and tasty on the inside.   For dinner we split the Jamacian Green Curry veggies with shrimp. The curry was pretty tasteless and the veggies were mostly potatoes. 4 small size shrimp were hardly worth the up charge. In addition, we split the tuna tartar for dinner. It was very flavorful. Pure clean tuna. No fillers to stretch it out. It was topped with an avocado. Very tasty. Best value of the night.   The one thing that blew us away were the drinks. We ordered a drink, who's name escapes me but is was a whiskey drink and we asked for it to be made with our favorite spirit instead of well whiskey. It was tasty. HOWEVER, at the end of the night, when we got our bill, we noticed that they charged us for the original price plus a full up charge for the premium spirit/ not the difference between the two. $21 for a small drink in Pittsburgh. You have got to be kidding me. It's Pittsburgh, NOT NYC. Get it together.",

Robin has been my contact and does a fantastic job helping me stay on budget, while still providing me such great food options!  This most recent time, I ordered food for 50 and it was delivered.. (by Robin's husband, he introduced himself after I was raving about Robin. We then struck up a convo about how I think Bill Fuller must be a cool human after listening to him on WYEP. Hey Bill - If you read this, I need to know if you'll adopt me around holidays!)  Okay, back on topic. I ordered a sandwich, salad and paella combo. The order arrived on time and was set up fabulously. I love that I can always count on those print-out cards to label the food. With events, I am always being asked what ingredients are in the food, so it's great to defer to the cards. Both the veggie cuban and the chicken sandwiches are big hits. Ended up having a large amount of the paella left over, mostly due to the amount included.   If you're looking for unique catering options, I would highly suggest Kaya. The menu is easy to customize and able to accommodate vegetarians.   One last thing: a tip on tipping.. Ask to add it to the invoice, otherwise it will be too late to add on once delivered!",

I'm a huge fan of mangoes so I enjoyed it but my friends disagreed because they would've liked more guac for the price we paid. The chips to guac ratio was also uneven. Way too little chips! For the entree, I got fish tacos. It was okay, but the fish was a little too crispy for my liking. I have to say though, I absolutely loved their white sangria. Drinks are half off during happy hour on weekdays 4:30-6:30pm as well!   One thing that ticked me off during my visit was the nonchalant servers. I know Kaya has the whole laid-back beach vibe going on, but that doesn't mean that the servers should behave that way too. We were in a rush, and whenever we asked our server for the check, refill, to-go boxes, he would respond with a \"Okay, I'll get that for you in a second\" and skip along to do something else first. It gets pretty frustrating the third time he says that. A little sense of urgency would be nice.   I've heard great things about Kaya from other people, but sadly I can't say the same. It didn't live up to my expectations and there's nothing phenomenal about the food or service.",

As much as I love the Italian food in the Strip District, Kaya is a nice departure from that.  Fruity Caribbean flavors and aromas aren't a norm for the area.   Their coleslaw is a unique ginger-based, crunchy recipe that goes well with the entrees.   Try especially the fish tacos and flank steak sandwich.     The service was friendly but a bit slow.   The water served with the meal was lukewarm and very chlorinated.   The food took a long time to come out once we ordered.",

This was my third time being there and all three times ordered their big salad but this time with Tofu. The option without Tofu is definitely better.  The tofu was quite without any taste and somewhat destroyed the salad experience. Also, the iceberg lettuce in the salad does not contribute to much of a great experience.

Fried Chicken and Waffle. For only $13, you can partake of one of the best brunch dishes of all time. The menu describes this item so normally, but this isn't a normal dish. The waffle is good but the chicken packs a spicy punch while the maple syrup is extra sweet to balance that sassy Caribbean flavor. It's an absolutely incredible experience, and we'll definitely be back to enjoy it again.",

    "text": "Oh Kaya. What a love/hate relationship I have with you. There are some truly great things on your menu. But the service . . .   As one of the few places open in the Strip District after 5 pm I usually come here at least once a month if not more. As I am usually by myself I sit at the always-packed bar. And that's where the problems start. One bartender for a bar with around 20 stools that spans nearly the length of the restaurant? I don't know how they do it. During the evening hours, this is just not enough. Especially as they're serving food and fancy drinks.   Management - Please try adding a bartender at happy hour to say 9 pm. The food runners NEVER remember your whole order. I don't get silverware until I ask for it. I don't get my aioli that's supposed to come with the dish until I ask for it. And the runners always look confused or put out with my simple requests. The bartenders are supposed to be providing these things but when do they have the time? Also - why does the food always end up on a metal prison tray with paper that ends up sticking to the food? It makes cutting impossible. Try plates. Really. They work. I know you're going for the rustic look but it's just not practical.   Now I know what you're thinking. You're sitting at the bar ya dumb bunny. You can't expect table-level service. Oh yes, I can. Single people are making up more and more of the dining population. Expectations on the part of the restaurants need to be adjusted. And I have eaten at the tables in a group. The service was still not great. Lots of socializing between servers and not much hustle. And still, the resentful looks when you ask for things like cutlery and water. Now that's just silly.  If you're going to Kaya be sure to check out the Fried Chicken Thursdays. I wish they would do away with the incompatible sides like tortillas(?) and do a take on island soul food. Also the conch fritters would go really well with the chicken. Oh gawd. The conch fritters are so good. Crunchy on the outside and almost creamy on the inside. And the spicy mayo (aioli) is insanely good. You'll want to use it on everything. I love the Poke bowl as well although I usually order it without all the fruit. I prefer a simpler version. Pro Tip - The side dishes and appetizers overall seem to be much more interesting and just plain better than main entrees. The cocktails could be a lot better as I have ordered many different kinds and haven't found a stand-out. The liquor choices could be expanded as well.   But whatever you do Kaya please don't lose the conch fritters.",

This place is not kids friendly but if you so happen to have your kids with you , you will be alright. We ordered a number of things and they all turned out good except for the grilled Steak with chimichurri sauce. The steak was a bit burnt and the sauce was not a good fit neither was any other option brought to me. So i left very disappointed! But my server Kurt i think his name was was so awesome and he tried so hard to give me a sauce to go with the steak. But at the end of the day. I think it wasn't the steak but the sauce that was so much of a problem. So i recommended this place but skip the steak. I am a New Yorker i know good food!",

    "text": "Never a disappointment! Make a reservation online before you go, as it's pretty small inside and can get crowded, and try to get there during happy hour. Kaya has one of the best happy hours in the city!  There is not a lot of outdoor seating (and it's basically just tables on the sidewalk), but the inside decor is really cool. The Caribbean theme is unique when compared to other restaurants in Pittsburgh, and they really do it well.  Some of the food I've had there include the following (spoiler alert: I like everything I've ever had here...):  --Jamaican Jerk Wings - so good! The sauce is tangy and the wings are cooked just right. --Yucatan Hot Bean Dip - it's a heavy, thick dip, but it's really tasty and cheesy, mild on the spices. --Tropical Guacamole - really tasty, pineapple and the mango in this give it a sweet and fresh flavor --Caribbean Flank Steak Stir Fry: had this most recently.. OMG. My boyfriend kept trying to steal bites. It is a huge portion, the steak is cooked perfectly and there is a lot of it. The flavors just go together so well! -- Crispy Fish Tacos - this used to be my favorite menu item before I experienced the steak stir fry. The portions of the fish are really generous and cooked to the right amount of crispiness, but be wary of the spicy creme fraiche, it's REALLY spicy.  -- Fried Chicken (on Thursdays) - my boyfriend makes sure that we only go on Thursdays so that he can order the fried chicken. It's really fresh, hand battered, and you get SO MUCH. He tried the Nashville hot once, and it is no joke. We found it too spicy to actually be enjoyable.   In summary, make a reservation, be cautious of anything advertised as \"spicy\", because they do not mess around with the spices, but otherwise, everything here is SO GOOD. The service is always on point, and they have an awesome draft and cocktail menu. What's not to like?  One more tip -- make sure to sign up through Big Burrito's website to get on their mailing list. You get a coupon for a free meal on your birthday every year :)",

I instantly thought of Kaya since we never been and it was on my list of places to try.  We arrived around 630pm. We were informed inside was booked for the night from reservations but outside seating was available. It was a nice night so we decided why not.  For appetizer, we tried the 'Jumbo Lump' Crab Cakes ($11). They were absolutely delicious but it was a very small appetizer. Two tiny patties. Luckily it was just two of us sharing.  For entrees, I went with the Jerk Chicken Thighs ($18) which came with 3 thighs over well seasoned red beans & rice. It also came with a side of tomatoes, avacado & jalapeno which went great with red beans and rice. The entree also had a few pieces of perfect pita bread.   Bobby ordered the Skirt Steak ($27)  mainly because he wanted ox tail. The steak was seasoned so well, full of flavor and it was delicious!. I tried ox tail for the first time and I loved it as well.  Our server was friendly but seemed to disappear towards end of our meal. We waited a little while at the end to be checked on & get our bill.  I'm glad we experienced Kaya. It had a nice menu.. Not too big and overwhelming but enough dishes to want to try back. They had a great list of sandwiches under $15.   I'm excited to head back.  I heard about their amazing happy hour plus brunch!",

Sat down with a larger group for lunch and was left waiting as the waitress took the order of two other tables that sat down after us. After our drinks were put in our orders weren't taken until the drinks were ready (about 15 mins). When we put in order food orders we were stuck waiting another 45-50 mins for or food and no wait staff checked in letting us know there were busy or any update where our food was. After all of that after finishing our food we were stuck waiting another 15 mins before our plates were cleared, and another 10 mins before they checked in to ask if we wanted dessert. We decisively decline, conceded that by the time we received our dessert it would be time for dinner. But don't worry by the time we signed for our checks they managed to dim the lights, light the candles and create pretty decent ambiance.",

I've actually only been here twice, but my elder friend who came with me last night knew all the servers and the general manager. I'm surprised they were taken off of Pittsburgh's \"Best Restaurant List\" this year since their food and drinks are outstanding. I had the flank steak stir fry and it had all the right veggies and just the right amount of heat. I also had the capirinha and it was also mighty tasty. Since I work in the Strip now, this might be a more frequented lunch spot. Keep on keepin' on, Kaya!",

Service, although a little slow many times, is always friendly and special requests are taken easily.  I happened to come with a vegetarian friend and my four year old during my last visit. Being I had previously taken my vegan friend who still raves about this place, I thought it would be a good option! Their selection truly has something for everyone.   As for the food, we started with the pineapple guac - both of us were hungry and this was probably my favorite part of the meal. We also split the chile rellenos and the wild mushroom dishes which were both filling and tasty with lots of flavor. The tequila colada was delicious and my friend enjoyed his pharmacist's daughter cocktail. My normal favorite is usually their corn and conch chowder but I was looking to expand my samplings from them a bit more tonight. Their Caribbean rainbow salad is also awesome!  They also accommodated my daughter wanting a taco (slight meltdown when she got a quesadilla instead...until she tried it and realized what a quesadilla was) and also accommodated her request for \"fancy milk\" - she wanted an umbrella but very much enjoyed seeing the pretty pink grapefruit and decorative leaf. I spoke with the bartender later who was an absolute doll and he made sure to check that she had enjoyed it. Needless to say, Diva D had a bit of a \"night\" while we were there.",

I started with a cucumber jalapeno margarita and was hesitant since I'm not usually a huge fan of cucumbers - but I was so impressed. They use fresh lime juice and you could really tell.  We shared the Kaya Chips for an appetizer and these are the only reason this place isn't getting 5 stars. The salsa was good and fresh but the chips tasted kind of burnt and didn't have a ton of flavor other than black pepper.  My boyfriend got the jerk pork quesadilla with waffle fries - both of which he enjoyed. I can attest to the fries since I stole one haha.  I got the 1/2 jerk chicken and that was the star of the show. Such fresh ingredients. I asked for a side of jerk sauce since I expected it to come with that but that wasn't an issue! I have a medium-high spice tolerance and I thought the spice was just perfect.   I highly recommend this spot and look forward to returning.",

Haven't tried anything else on the menu but looking around everyone else's food looked good and looked happy with their food.  Their cocktails looked especially appealing. Will be coming back!",

The food was great and the drink list was good, nothing to write home about but certainly passable.

    "text": "Kaya has long been on my list of places I wanted to dine in Pittsburgh. Sadly, I never made it while living in the Burgh, but my husband and I met here on a Thursday when we were in town visiting. Thursday is fried chicken night for $18. Neither of us partook in this but it did look good. Kaya is probably the second most casual Big Burrito group restaurant after Mad Mex. The pricing is also similar to Mad Mex. Happy hour is not just at the bar and our server gave us a heads up when we sat down that we had 2 minutes left to get drinks in. Happy hour is totally worth it as ALL drinks are 50% off.   It took us FOREVER to get our drinks and that was the continued theme with service all night. Service was not great, but the food was on point! My husband ordered the jerked pulled pork quesadilla (spicy slaw, Chihuahua cheese, cucumber aioli), which came with a mixed greens salad. The portion was large and the spice was delicious. The pork was tender and flavorful too. The spicy slaw added a nice flavor addition. I ordered the Cuban sandwich (pork, turkey, ham, mayo, Swiss cheese, whole grain mustard, chipotle aioli, ) which came with sweet potato fries. The bread was crisp and well pressed. I loved the addition of the chipotle aioli which was also delicious for dipping the fries. All of the meat was tender and flavorful. The portion was very large too. The sweet potato fries were crispy and hot when served.   Parking was not too bad on this Thursday but be on the lookout for all of the construction which can wreck havoc on weekends I'm sure. I enjoyed my food, despite subpar service, and would return in the future.",

The fried chicken had a strong taste and a sour smell straight to my noise. It made me think of Buffalo wings. They put too much flour and fried the chicken for too long that the chicken skin was very thick (but very crispy indeed). I did enjoy the chicken with tortillas, salad and the sauce they provided. The sides neutralize the strong taste. However, when I ran out of tortillas, I did not like eating the chicken alone.   I enjoyed the fish taco. That is one of their most popular dishes. I am a cilantro person. I liked them on the crispy fried fish !",

The Jamaican Green Curry Vegetables and tofu lettuce wraps were excellent, and the tempura avocado tacos were pretty good but could maybe use a bit more flavor (I prefer salty/spicy over the more subdued fat of avocado so maybe this is a personal thing)  The ambience is really nice inside- spacious but no empty, vibrant but not too noisy.

    "text": "A friend and I went to Kaya for the vegetarian prix fixe menu that they have on the third Wednesday of every month, and it was incredible! There were two options for each course, so we each got one and shared so we could taste everything.   The atmosphere of the restaurant is really cool with Caribbean decorations, but it was a little dark. The food was presented beautifully, each dish was timed well, and they all tasted amazing too! I liked how each dish was very different from the last, but they somehow still worked together too. At first I thought that the portions were a little small, but I was stuffed by the end of the four course meal. Our favorite part of the meal was definitely the dessert--the chocolate cheesecake tasted like brownie batter (in the best way) and the raspberry sorbet was perfectly tart!   Please excuse the picture quality, again, it was a bit dark!",

It was the end of the work week and national margarita day. I had to be at Kaya for margs to observe the holiday. After scanning the list I opted for the Passion Paloma marg which wasn't too bad.   Appetizer: I'm a sucker for queso and when you throw the word fundido with it, I know it's going to be delicious because fundido means melted and melted cheese is always amazing.  Main course: Fish tacos were good. Can't say they were my favorite fish tacos in Pittsburgh but they were still delicious and a pretty decent size for 3 tacos.   Overall not a bad dining experience definitely a place I would go back to but not as often as other fish taco establishments.",

We got drinks and they averaged $6-10 and they were a little small in my opinion. our food averaged $18ish and that seemed high for what we got. I liked they had a lot of vegan and vegetarian options and the waiter told us each meal was made to order so it is very customizable. My friend got the poke bowl in a fried chicken bowl which was so unique and none of us had ever seen that before. I really like the Lawrenceville area and everything is so unique and trendy there.   If you come be prepared to spend at least $25 per person if you get a drink. My friend who got the cuban said they cut the pickles wrong and they should be longer (in long slices) rather than small circles.",

I was EXTREMELY happy, though, to be greeted by big enough portions that I could take almost a whole extra serving of paella home with me (this almost never happens to me, haha, I can eat a lot). Seriously, this serving was massive. Maybe the smaller portions are given out at lunch only, so if you want a huge pile of food, lol, stop by for dinner! Easily double what I would've expected for the price--$16 is totally worth it when I get lunch the next day out of it too!  the service was also great, even as we were there on a busy holiday--our waitress never let our water glasses empty and our food came out probably 4-5 minutes after ordering. I'll definitely be back.",

I was in a group of 3 and we didn't have reservations and upon arrival the bar was full. The staff was very accommodating and gave us a reserved table whose party wasn't arriving until later so we promised to be done by then. When we needed to leave the table, spots at the bar were open so that was very lucky! I had their margarita and plantain nachos. Omg. The nachos were aaamazing. I didn't want to share with my friends! :)   The second time I went to Kaya was for dinner on a Thursday night. We were a party of four and didn't make reservations but was pleasantly surprised that they had multiple tables inside and outside available. (I guess dinner w/o reservations on the weekends is more troublesome). I had their rainbow salad and it was very tasty.   Overall great experiences at Kaya. I look forward to coming back!",

Tip: sign up for the big burrito group mailing list and you'll get some great coupon goodies around November December  Parking: there are the pay stations as well as pay parking by the loading docks  I had a Bloody Mary with cucumber vodka because when in Rome. It was good but I think it was on the small side and full of ice.  We split the black bean dip with homemade chips. The chips were well seasoned: salty with some subtle heat. The black bean dip was very filling and lightly seasoned. It wasn't heavy and paired so well with the chips.   I got the veggie burrito (since it had mushrooms and seasonal veggies) but had them add the chorizo and bacon (for a few dollar up charge). This thing was gigundo! The over easy eggs were on top, so when you cut in the creamy yolky goodness cascaded down the burrito. This thing was chock full of potatoes, veggies, hunks of chorizo and pieces of crispy crunchy bacon. I used one of my BBG coupons and saved $10! I pretty much waddled out of there to do some shopping in the Strip.  Dinner review:  We stopped at the bar for happy hour which included all of the cocktails being half off! Beer also  We started with the chorizo queso dip and it was just simply phenomenal! Gooey cheese, spicy chorizo and homemade chips.   I got the Kaya burger and it did not disappoint. Cooked PERFECTLY to medium, this thing was thick and juicy. And can we talk about the waffle fries?! Like who does that?! NO ONE! They were outta this world.  1000000% will be going back",

The lettuce wraps reminded me very much of the Pennsyltucky fried tofu at sister restaurant Mad Mex, just with a slightly different flavor profile. The chocolate chile lava cake was served hot with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, which is the perfect way to round out a meal in my opinion ;)",

The fish tacos (talapia) were served with soft tortillas and asked for my fish grilled and was filling and tasty. Service was great, mildy pricy but rewarding. The only negative was the red sangria which wantde to be a real tasty drink but tasted more like enhanced kool-aid! :') Overall a positive experience and will be back.",

The strong mustard (infused with horseradish?) was a good addition to the flavor however. My dining companion had the curry vegetables ($10) and she was less than enthused.

If I retire to a carribean Island and Jamaica has sports books that serve wings like this, it's a done deal. After that recommendation, I turned over my life to the waitress, who was hardly stunning but could've convinced me to propose based on her food recommendations. She guided us through a meal of Jerk wings, Tempura Avocado, some Tacos Al Pastor that we split and a couple different brews that are not sold on the west coast but were very good.   I'd definitely go back, especially since this is the only entry that comes up for Carribean food in Pitt on Yelp.",

Definitely good for me since I sometimes forget that it's there!  I love the decor of this place...the caribbean theme with the colorful paintings and tiki heads hanging on the walls!  Unfortunately we didn't make dinner reservations and were forced to sit on the bongo-style stools with no seat back!  Liz the bartender completely made up for it - started off with their signature Kayapolitan which found its perfect spot between sweet and tart.  Then she made us her own secret cucumber concoction.  I didn't really believe the cucumber part of the drink until she actually pulled the cucumber out and sliced it up.  The drink was AMAZING...highly recommend it if she's there to make it!  We started off with the Seared Sea Scallops, PEI Mussels and the Calamari.  There's no doubt that they were all great, but out of the 3, the Mussels were by far my favorite...portion was huge!  For dinner I ordered the Grilled Salmon Salad...I loved the spiced pecans, crumbled bleu and sliced apples.  The salmon was also grilled to perfectly.  Between the food and Liz as our kick-ass bartender this was a great way to start off our Saturday night!",

    "text": "Visited Kaya on Thursday for fried chicken.  Happy hour is a good deal with 1/2 price drinks. Service was good but for some reason the kitchen was backed up.  The manager was apologetic and comped one round of drinks.  Nice.  Appetizers were good but not great.  Steamed pork buns a bit bland.  Soft Shell Crab was good but $15 for one is a bit high.  Now the reason we went, the chicken.  Good, but not as good as we remembered.  A bit unusual in that the batter/crust fell off the chicken when we picked it up.  Not sure what that's all about.  Also, while you get 5 pieces, the actual chicken was very small.  Mostly batter.  A bit disappointing.",

It was packed when we got there, so we had a seat at the bar, and after admiring the art, we decided to eat at the bar.    First of all, the service was great.  Our apps came out quickly and were divine!  I had the Tempura Avocado, which was served with an amazing chipotle reduction.  The combination of creamy avocado with crisp tempura was absolutely perfect.    Our food came out quite quickly, as well, and was absolutely perfect.  I got the Tropical Paella, and could not have been more impressed.  The seafood was cooked perfectly, it had the delicious saffron flavoring, with pineapple and jerk spices added to it.  So amazing, I would like it again as soon as possible.    Throughout the night, the service was just amazing.  I wish Kaya would come further east so I could enjoy it more often!",

    "text": "I have now been to Kaya twice, once for dinner and once for brunch and both occasions the food has been lackluster at best.   Kaya is attempting to pull off a high concept fusion style restaurant, blending Caribbean, South American, Pacific and Mexican cuisine into an appetizing blend of food. To be perfectly honest I am skeptical of fusion places due to the high rate of failures in execution. In many cases you have a young hot-shot chef who wants to be known as a bold flavor innovator, blending cuisines that he has never mastered to achieve usually poor to mediocre results. The dishes in many cases have only a vague similarity to the original and if it would be beneficial if the chef would stick to concentrating on the basics instead of cooking up bizarre fusion dishes.  Some examples would be the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Wings - which tasted nothing like Jerk seasoning should (loaded with allspice, heat of the scotch bonnet pepper, cinnamon, cloves, etc. Instead it looked like we had a dab of commercially bought jerk seasoning tossed on the wings after cooking. The wings themselves were cooked nicely, big and juicy but still had some pin feathers attached that were not removed, attention to details such as this is mandatory.   For brunch I tried the eggs benedict with smoked salmon, the eggs were poached hard, again another detail that is unacceptable and sloppy. The salmon was cheap, the cornbread it was served on was good and made for an interesting combination but the addition of smoked paprika on top was okay, but nothing exciting.   I could go on and on, but you see the problems.  2.5 Stars because the place is interesting for Pittsburgh but for those of us who have traveled and eaten in the Caribbean, South America and Mexico, the food comes off as dull copies of vibrant originals.",

    "text": "Maybe my expectations were a little high, but I left Kaya a bit disappointed.  I'm sure the gloomy, slushy weather didn't help, but the restaurant seemed a bit too dim.  The decor was fine, the music was pretty good, and our server was very friendly.  The food was just a little mediocre.  We started with the mango & tomatillo salsa - very chunky and not bad at all, but the Kaya chips were a bit dry and some tasted a little burnt.  As my entree, I chose one of the todo en uno options - a smaller sandwich + 2 sides - with the pressed manchego and idiazabel sandwich, and the spicy slaw and the sweet potato fries as my sides.  The bread for the sandwich was a bit dry, the cheeses were a bit bland, there was a bit too much arugula and the plantain chips on the sandwich had no plantain-y flavor.  The slaw was also very dry and the only spice I tasted was pepper.  The sweet potato fries were very good though.  Boyfriend had the pressed serrano ham & manchego sandwich, which he also said was a bit bland.  We shared the creme brulee for dessert, which was not bad.  The bill came to about $36 before tip.  As we were eating dessert, we heard a couple at the next table rave about the Kaya burger, so I may have to try that next time.  I'm also curious about their vegetarian prix fixe dinners - an amuse bouche, 3 courses, and dessert for $39 with plenty of vegan options.  They also have a chocolate & rum Valentine's dinner coming up.  Overall - not very impressed the first time, but willing to come back and try something else.",

We accidentally hit a happy hour we didn't know about, and had a half hour wait for a table; no problems.  The bartenders basically ignored us for fifteen minutes while we sat there - seated at the bar - and that kind of soured the tone.  The portion sizes were opulent, and most of the food was excellent.  But one of the appetizers was just straight up burned; it'd be hard to respect the food you're serving *and* let that out of the kitchen.    A-OK, since it averaged between excellent and terrible.",

    "text": "3.5 stars.  I've had the Kaya burger in the past as well as brunch yesterday.  Kaya focuses on an \"island\" theme to their food and is located in the Strip District at the corner of 20th and Smallman St.  Brunch on Sunday starts at 11 AM.  My companion and I decided to sit outdoors since it was a rare beautiful day of mid-November in Pittsburgh.  We started out with their smoked salmon appetizer and their Jamaican Jerk chicken wings.  For entrees I got the Kaya Benedict.  I ordered the smoked salmon b/c I like beginning my meals with some sort of cured meat, either a smoked salmon or some sort of antipasto.  The smoked salmon appetizer came out with a large serving of smoked salmon topped with minced onion, cilantro, a drizzle of creme fraiche and two fresh tortillas from Reyna's Foods right down the street.  We added the Jamaican Jerk chicken wings and it was definitely a good decision.  Typically chicken wings are fried and then tossed in a sauce.  These wings were super flavorful and crispy; I think they were marinated and then baked?  I'll ask next time I'm there.  The lime cilantro sauce was creamy and full of cilantro, but I would have liked a bit more lime for a little more zing.  The Kaya Benedict didn't meet my expectations at all.  It was cornbread with roast pork topped with poached eggs and hollandaise sauce.  The cornbread was sweet but it just didn't fit into the dish at all and clashed with the roast pork and the egg.  It's texture was soft and made the entire entree mushy...  The roast pork too... completely uninspiring.  It came with grilled pineapple, which was pretty good as well as their house hash brown, which was a plated as a weird mound with slight crustiness on the outside and mainly mush inside.  The spices of it just didn't click with me.  The Kaya burger though, is one of Kaya's saving graces (along with their happy hour).  I ordered it medium rare and it came topped with bacon, avacado, tomato, cheese, special sauce, and a sunny side up egg.  It comes with a side of chips, but you can substitute their side salad if you want.  Gourmet burgers are always interesting because the chef's choice in combination of toppings and the bun shows a representation of his/her cooking style.  As someone who views himself as a burger purist, I'm not too familiar with gourmet burgers in general, but the Kaya burger did impress me.  I'd probably just stick munching on some appetizers with drinks during their weekday happy hour from 5-7 PM.",

My experience  with Carribean places has been shabby restaurants with great authentic food made with soul. This place didn't involve plastic furniture or island accents. I was suspicious especially when a hostess asked if we had reservations? Anyhow I had my 5 year old son with me. The menu is not what I would call kid friendly, nor is the ambience. My kid was on best behavior for some reason but I wouldn't suggest bringing yours here.  We shared the jerk wings with a killer cilantro sauce yum o. My friend had a chowder and crab cakes while I tucked into \"the best burger in Pittsburgh\". The best burger involves an egg and guacomole and bacon on the burger, not the best that I have had, I feel that Primanti Bros could offer some competition if burger judges weren't apathetic to that chain. My friend liked her food a lot. I ended up getting the lava cake a la mode which was decent because chocolate is always decent.  It's OK.. Seems like a nice date night spot but don't come expecting authentic Carribean dishes.",

    "text": "Since Big Burrito was kind enough to send me a gift card in the mail for mah birthday, my boyfriend insisted that we go out to dinner for my birthday...again....yes, this was my third birthday dinner in the period of one week.  Hey, you only turn 27 once!  I decided we should go on a Thursday, because that was Fried Chicken Night and I don't even need to say why that sounds insanely awesome.  I didn't even end up ordering the fried chicken, but I made my boyfriend get it so I could try it.  Birthday girl gets to make decision!  We didn't make reservations, just showed up around 7 pm or so.  They were pretty busy and we thought we'd have to wait awhile, but by the time we ordered drinks at the bar, our table was ready.  We both ordered delicious cocktails - one was a grapefruit-basil margarita, and I forgot what the other one was.  That's what I get for being a bad Yelper and not posting for a few weeks.  Since it wasn't quite 7 pm yet, our drinks were half off, making any cocktail suddenly an amazing bargain.  Definitely a good reason to come to Kaya early!    Our server was friendly, and he recommend the barramundi in chile broth.  I sprung for it, since it was an expensive entree and I wanted to get my gift card's worth.  My boyfriend got the fried chicken, at my insistence.  Let me say that my barramundi was OUTSTANDING.  Way better than I expected.  Fresh, flavorful, and just marvelous all around.  Totally worth the money, but if you have a gift card then it's a don't-miss!  I was so happy that I didn't even really want to share my boyfriend's chicken, but I took a few bites.  It was incredibly crispy, which I loved, but honestly it wasn't as flavorful as I hoped.  More salt in the breading needed, perhaps?  Chicken was very juicy though - just didn't deliver a flavor punch.  It was served with a salsa of some sort, so perhaps that was meant to compensate, but I hoped for more kick.  I wouldn't get the chicken again, but I'd go back in a heartbeat for that barramundi and another half-price cocktail!  mmmmmm.",

Great for watching all the hustle and bustle the strip has to offer on a Saturday afternoon. I had the Kaya Burger and the red sangria. It was just what I was craving.  Mmm beef.   It had avocado, bacon, fried egg, and kayas secret sauce, mayo based with sweet potato fries and chipotle aioli for dipping.  It was darn delicious.  The egg yolk was oozing out perfectly over the beef and bacon.  My only complaint is it was well done, asked for medium, and it took about 40 minutes to get our food without an explanation or an apology.  Just a heads up would've been nice. They were empty inside with a few patio tables outside.  Will be back next time at the strip!  Can't wait to try more of their menu items!",

We had previous reservations, which had been made that week, so it appears as though it was relatively easy to get in if you plan ahead a little (as opposed to Salt of the Earth which was booked well over a week ahead).  It's a long, narrow restaurant with seating outdoors. Everytime I've driven past Kaya in the summers, it's got lots of people sitting outside relaxing and eating.  My friends enjoyed the variety of beers on tap as well as the sangria and mojitos (and nojitos since one was preggers). For the mains, I had the  seafood jambalaya was quite good. Good flavors, nicely melded together.  When I started this review, I was going to give 4 stars but then I remembered that they took extra care to accommodate some friends who have various food allergies, including gluten. One friend called ahead about his allergies and the chef and waiter marked up a menu with which dishes that he could order. For that service, I'm bumping Kaya up to 5 stars.",

I frequent here with vegetarian friends thanks to their vegie friendly menu that actually taste really delicious, and they offer a monthly vegetarian prix fixe dinner. Unfortunately it did not last long, disappointed twice, in a row. There's this Sunday brunch in mid January that ended up with sadly dressed frisee salad taste nothing but oily albeit produce being fresh. Their infamous tofu taco came up with jalepeno sauce so powerful that the heat just burnt every other taste bud off.  Then, we returned for a birthday dinner last Tuesday for a vegetarian friend. I am glad the food picked up their normal deliciousness, however, the service was quite a let down. Our server, took the only one drink order and just walked away not bothering asking the rest of the table. On a Tuesday night, pre-dinner time, with the dining place half full, I should've warned myself just stand clear from the service. Not surprisingly, the entire dining time, you gotta just live with it. Two out of the three appetizers came out missing core ingredients. The crab cakes, good on themselves, did not cry too hard for the mango aioli that probably left out weeping somewhere in the back of the kitchen. Mahi mahi came as almost disguised bacalao (salted dry cod), you got it, and of course fried plantain was just another redundancy from the menu. My friend got the fried avocado taco with jalepeno peppers on top while asked specifically for no heat. Again the server came up with the clever 'at least they are still within eye sight', call it professional!  At the end of the day, it was absolutely another delicious dinner at kaya, minus the minor imperfections. I will probably still be back, but definitely will skim the menu without looking into too much details, because you know, redundancy.",

The Cuban was very good and as we were ordering the group at the next table told us how good the sandwich is so we ordered with the sweet potato fries.  Very good Cuban. Would recommend highly. The hostess was very nice and friendly and our server was great!",

First impression of the restaurant was the host (or manager even) who hurriedly told us it would be an hour and half wait for a table inside since we didn't have a reservation...  I was confused though because as I looked around the dining room it looked to be only about 40% occupied.  We opted to be seated outside and our table was basically on top of Smallman St ...  The menu looked exciting and we ordered sangria, so things looked on the up and up. But... when we started eating all of our food was sort of just \"alright\" and very one note.  Don't know if I'll go back.",

We also ordered hanger steak and fish tacos. All excellent. The paella was not that good. A little disappointed since everything else was so good. We were so full couldn't do dessert.

The cocktails were delicious (loved my Dark n' Stormy, Blood Orange Mimosa was splendid, and even the sip of Waffle-Martini I tried was yummy, if a bit sweet for my tastes.) I ordered the pork benedict (poached eggs + pulled pork + corn cakes? #duh), served with grilled pineapple, and enjoyed every bite. The benedicts were on the small size, but if you want a gut buster, go for any of the omelets, sandwiches, or the burger. Be sure to upgrade to the sweet potato fries served with a spicy special sauce. The brunch menu was extensive enough to please my meat-and-potatoes grandmother as well as my cousin's with more exotic palettes.  Our waiter was congenial, gave informed answers about the menu, made great recommendations, and was a total cutie. (Hey boy ;) AND he didn't get mad when my talkative aunts lingered at the table for 40 minutes after the meal.  All in all, everyone had a great time. I would love to return for dinner, or just a few drinks at the bar with friends.",

    "text": "We've been here two weeks in a row already for lunch and brunch and will definitely be coming back in the future. I'm not sure how authentically \"Jamaican\" the food is, but it's still pretty good food nonetheless. It's probably best to get reservations, because it fills up pretty fast on weekends, if you want to avoid waiting around.   It's nice that they change their menu every so often, to keep things new. The brunch menu online hasn't been updated since April 2011, but after eating brunch there today, i think it's not too far from the real thing. For brunch today, hubby and I ordered the pulled pork benedict and the shimeji mushroom omlette.   Hubby really likes the pulled pork ($13, i think) there. Too bad they don't sell it by itself. It was also pretty good in sandwich form last week when there were bananas mixed in. I know, it sounds weird, but the added sweetness really does work. Reminds me of a sweeter/mild curry flavor. Anyways, brunch options come with grilled pineapples and breakfast potatoes (referred to as hashbrowns, but they really are cubed bits of potatoes and onion and bell peppers). His pulled pork benedict came as two crisp cornbread rounds with pulled pork piled on top and two poached eggs with hollandaise sauce. We got the eggy-buttery sauce on the side, which was good, because it didn't need too much sauce. It was pretty flavorful on its own.   My shimeji mushroom omlette ($9) turned out really well. Our waitress actually admitted that was her favorite. They used shimeji mushrooms (the little japanese brown ones that you buy in clumps) and some arugula (i think) and chevre cheese inside, then I requested the omlette to be made with egg whites. It was a good combination with the chevre cheese, and I was surprised that they were nice enough to change it to an egg-white omlette free of charge. I'm pretty used to being told it'll cost extra. Oh, it also came with grilled tortillas, which are clearly way better than plain 'ol tortillas. And the salsa verde drizzled on top is amazingly good! And the soy sausage patties were especially delicious. They didn't taste like soy at all. Kinda meaty, without being too heavy/oily.   When they brought out the dessert menu, we saw the ice-cream/sorbet assortment for $6.50. We got to pick 3 flavors/scoops on tartlets (out of a choice of 5 or 6 options). We went with the chipotle, avocado, and coconut/chocolate. The coconut/chocolate is the best chocolate flavored ice cream we've ever tasted! It was a really rich and velvety dark dark dark chocolate ice cream. I assume it was made with coconut milk, because there was a very subtle coconut taste, but it's not as if there were flakes in there. The avocado was our 2nd favorite. The taste and texture reminded me of a lighter green tea ice cream. Lastly, there was the chipotle ice cream. It was good, but just good for a bite. The aftertaste gets a bit too spicy/overpowering and is hard to get rid of.                                               All in all, a great meal, and for a great price. Deee-licious!!",

It's funny because there was over half the room available inside. Her claims over reserved tables were unwarranted, there were plenty of tables open and weren't being seated for another 45 minutes.

Their drink menu is WAY above average, and the food isn't like anything else around.   I have been a vegetarian now for 2 years, but prior to that I LIVED for Kaya's fish tacos. Quite possibly the best in the city. Now that I'm all veggie, I go for their tofu tacos, which are one of their best veggie dishes. They also have a great avocado egg sandwich served with their amazing mixed green salad. Don't forget a side of sweet potato fries no matter WHAT you order - they are a must have.  Definitely plan ahead with reservations, or risk it and end up drinking at the bar for 45 minutes while waiting. Either way it's a win-win!!",

Another problem I had was the rum selection was extensive but like most places in the city they completely miss one of the best destinations in the Caribbean. The Dominican Republic. Now I have to admit because my wife is Dominican and i have been exposed to that culture the most I tend to look for those flavors and I never see it represented in Pittsburgh. But that's more of a issue with the city's Latin population not having representation then just this place. I would like the addition of brugal anejo rum",

Two visits ago when we ate outside our meal was subpar. We chalked it up to how busy they were and ignored it. Today my wife and I ate at Kaya and my meal was horrible. I got tofu tacos and my wife had tempura avocado tacos. She really liked her meal and it came out hot. Mine was cold, the tofu batter flavorless (use to have seasoning to it) and the guacamole they buried under everything was a brown sludge. The side salad that came with it had mushy runny lettuce hidden under good lettuce.   This is similar to how our last meal was there  6 months ago. I'm thru with Kaya. It's beyond forgivable to serve that bad of lettuce and bad guac. I can let the cold tofu slide when there are other cold stuff on it.   Not to mention our server was less than pleasant. We've had her before and she was the same then too.   All of this was on a Friday at 2:00 pm for a late lunch. The place had one other table, nobody else.   Why I give it two stars? My wife enjoyed her meal and the booze was good.   Hopefully this isn't indicative of the other Big Burrito chains.",

The fish tacos were with tilapia, and a disappointment based on all the amazing reviews.I would give this place 3 stars but the service was quite off-putting at the beginning. We had reservations and the hostess told me to seat myself outside. The waiter came out and got upset that I seated myself and told me to go back inside until i explained I was told to sit here by the hostess.

Crispy fish tacos were very flavorful.  Nice experience overall and a definite treat!  Will be back.",

    "text": "I have no idea why I never got around to reviewing Kaya seeing as it's been a staple in my Pittsburgh restaurant rotation since I moved here. In fact, it was the first \"nice\" meal I had in Pittsburgh, before I even made my official move...I celebrated my 21st birthday here! Although it's not one of my very very favorite spots in the 'burgh, the food is consistently good and the Carribean-inspired fare is something that I normally wouldn't gravitate toward, so it's nice when I want something a bit different than the standard \"New American.\"  I mostly come here for their brunch, and one of the big reasons is that it's served until 3pm! The only thing is, make sure you show up at least 15 minutes before that...the \"brunch kitchen\" closes at 3 o'clock sharp, unlike sister restaurant Casbah, which seats for brunch until 2pm but won't rush your ordering. Anyway...my favorite thing on the brunch menu is the roasted pork benedict with grilled pineapple. The Chilaquiles (basically, breakfast nachos) are also delicious, weird as they may sound. And the Kaya Burger is always a safe choice.  The dinner menu changes, so I've never ordered the same thing twice here. But everything I have had has been great. One of my favorite apps is the corn and lentil beignets--if you like spicy, get them! They also have a pretty large and super fun (read: girly) cocktail menu, and since they are tropical in nature, it's totally okay to imbibe at any time of the day! That's how that works, right? Riiight...?  They have a fried chicken night on Thursdays that a lot of people like. Kinda makes me wish I liked fried chicken so I could try it but I'm weird like that!",

Great specialty cocktails (love the Frozen mojito and the Lava Lover), great appetizers (I recommend the Mango-Tomatillo Salsa and Bean Dip with their house made chips) and some of the yummiest Fish Tacos ever.  Even better has been the service on my multiple visits here... I find the staff friendly, knowledgeable (when my friend asked about an odd beer on their menu, she described it to a T and offered her a sample before a whole glass as it was on draft), and attentive.  If you have not been to Kaya, I highly recommend checking it out!",

The drink menu had a lot of interesting options on there. We started with the fried conch (excellent). I then had the paella, which was filled with chicken, chorus, mussels, scallops and lots of vegetables and pineapple. The paella was great and it was the perfect size for a lunch portion so that I didn't feel like it was going to waste. Travis L. had the jerked pulled pork quesadilla, which went really well with the spiced slaw on top. The service was excellent and the owner is an incredibly friendly women that makes an effort  to see that all of her patrons are pleased.",

    "text": "Who thought homemade bean dip with housemade chips could taste SOOO darn good??? Well, I didn't until my visit to Kaya.  As many times as I've driven past this place, I can't believe last weekend was my first visit.   We had reservations but it seemed like we arrived at a good time before it started to get jam packed, around noon.  We were greeted at the door and arrived a little before our seating time but offered to be seated immediately and we agreed.  We ordered the wings, bean dip (I know I mentioned this already :), paella and the fish tacos.  I have NO complaints.  Quite honestly, after the bean dip (3rd mention), my favorite was the salad that came with my fish tacos...so simple with a lime based dressing. OMGee! Okay, please don't think I didn't love everything else because I did.  The fish tacos were amazingly good with perfectly cooked pieces of fish, jicama slaw and buttery pieces of fresh avocado slices.  Seriously, each bite made me feel as though I was in the caribbean somewhere.  (Maybe a bit dramatic, okay).  My friend's entree was the paella, which was good, pieces of pineapple were really juicy throughout and shrimp cooked perfectly...although it was the least favorite for me because my husband's brother has me spoiled by the paella he makes on the grille :)    All said and done, Kaya did not disappoint and actually exceeded my expectations.  This restaurant is owned by Big Burrito Group and I've been very happy with all of their restaurants I've tried.  Can't wait to visit Kaya again.  My next trip will be on a Thursday.  I hear the chicken is to die for...  YUM!",

There was only one group waiting for a table when we got there, so the reservation may not have been necessary.  We were starving after a long day in the heat.  I wanted to try everything on their menu, but we narrowed out it down to 3 dishes between the 2 of us.  We shared the 3 salads (a spicy eggplant salad, a spiced chickpea hummus and quinoa served with grilled tortillas), the jamaican jerk wings (with cilantro cream sauce) and the fish tacos.  Of the 3 dishes, the wings were my favourite.  Not only were they gigantic, they were actually moist and the sauce was very tasty.  The salads were also delicious and I enjoyed the variety.  The fish tacos were a little bland, so the cilantro cream sauce from the wings dish came in handy.  I also tried the Kaya Juice, which is a combination of mango, guava, cranberry and pineapple juices.  Great concoction!  We ordered way too much food for the 2 of us.  We struggled to finish, but the waiter wouldn't let us give up.  Luckily, Kaya is located in the Strip district and we were able to go for a long stroll after dinner.",

It was serve with saffron rice and was the perfect portion.   Our server, Brenda was great -took time to explain the dishes we asked about sharing her honest opionion on her most and least favorites.   I recommend the dark and stormy - black jamaican rum and ginger beer - very refreshing.   Returned the next day for a dark and stormy and stayed for dinner - again a great server and a wonderful meal. No matter what you orer you will be satisfied.   The place has a nice buzz about it - will return and would highly recommend it anyone visiting the strip looking for something different.",

This place was so fantastic, I actually created a yelp account just to leave a review (then got distracted and never left it). My husband and I were in town visiting his family and originally planned to go to Pamela's diner but there was a 45 minute wait. So we walked down the strip and stumbled upon this place. Boy am I glad we did. At first, I was apprehensive because there was only 1 other table with patrons but my group and I were starving so we just went with it. I ordered the crab omelet and I can't remember what everyone else ordered because I was too wrapped up in the orgasm that was on my plate. Seriously, it was that good. I would probably never pair a crab omelet with bacon and grilled pineapple on the side, but oh my word the combination was amazing. We had a larger party of 8 and our server was really attentive. I can't even believe how not busy it was on a Sunday morning. Pamela's had a 3-page wait list and this place was empty! Unbelievable.   When we were headed out, I asked if I could speak with the manager to thank her for such a lovely experience and she was very gracious. I now can't wait to visit the area again, this place is an absolute must. One of the best brunches I've had, ever.",

I'm not sure if they use sustainable seafood, but they're meats are all from good local farms, which I always appreciate from a restaurant.     I had the cuban sandwich, which starts out as really good and then jumps to amazing when you dip it in the accompanying chipotle aioli...yum!

I read that it's a Carribean style type of food and coming back from there for spring break last month I was afraid everything would be made out of conch and shellfish. Fortunately only half the menu consisted of that.  We began with some calamari, a carafe of the lava lover (which in essence is just a large bay breeze), and some of us at the table spoke nicely of the kaya burger but I ordered the paella which came out in a nice large portion. It wasn't the best or worst paella I've had before. The service came and went and the place seemed to have trouble bringing everyone's meals out at a timely fashion. Albeit, we had a large party, the last few people shouldn't have to wait an added 15 minutes to get his food while everyone else was sitting there waiting for our dishes to get cold.  I couldn't really tell what the draw of this place is, neither the food or drinks were very unique, even though it specializes in its own type of cuisine. If I had to rank the big burrito restaurants, Kaya comes in last.",

However, the $10 off an entree coupons I got in the mail made it possible for me to try Kaya last Sunday with two friends.  Our table ordered drinks, most of which ranged from $9 to $15.  I ordered a Mojito ($9). It wasn't very strong, but it was aesthetically pleasing and tasted OK.  We ended up ordering the Jerk Pulled Pork Quesadilla ($14) and Crispy Fish Tacos ($18) to split amongst the three of us.  Both came with 3 sections/ 3 tacos. The Quesadilla was spicier than I expected but good. There was plenty of meat, but I wanted more cheese.  However, I preferred the fish tacos. There was so much fried fish in these tacos, and the slaw and cilantro mix was perfect.  The three tacos would have been enough food for a meal and a half for one person.  Similar to Casbah, I find the Caribbean ambiance odd with the menu. However, I do like the theming of the restaurants.   While Kaya is not in my budget since it is a bit pricey in relation to the quality, I did enjoy my meal and the ambiance.",

The host and waiter both were very polite and caring as we went through the menu from drinks (providing thoughtful advice on the sangria) to the dishes. Everything was plated beautifully and more importantly, they taste delicious. They definitely know how to use avocado and vegetables well to pair against the main meats or seafood. If you don't know what to get, fish tacos won't let you down! The portions are large too for which I am thankful for.  Now it is located on Smallman St so it is out of the way, definitely a night life area so weekday dinner is naturally quieter. If you're looking for a nice fancy casual dinner outing, Kaya should be on your list as well!",

First,  before you think about dinner, the Pork Nachos were out of this world! Everything was perfectly proportioned and delicious to start the night off.    For dinner, I got the Jamaican Jerk wings (Yes it's listed as an app but I fell in love with them the first time I dined here). The jerk sauce is THE BEST JERK SAUCE I'VE TASTED here in the states. Again,  I would compare them to the jerk chicken I got while my wife and I were in Jamaica.  Just incredible.  You get 10 crispy wings with sauce on the bottom of the plate.  Myself being the dipper I am,  I had to ask for a side of sauce.  My wife got the crispy fish tacos and loved every bite. I can't speak about them too much because she didn't do much sharing (so you know they're good). The fish looked perfectly breaded,  not to thick but just enough.     The service was amazing!  Everyone was very nice and professional.  You can tell the staff genuinely has a good time and enjoys working there.  We went for my wife's birthday and they couldn't have treated her better.  From wishing her a happy birthday when we were seated to helping us celebrate with a lava cake. If you dine here,  save room and eat a small lunch because everything you try here will blow your taste buds away!   I would 100% recommend this place and definitely will be returning.  Thank you so much for the amazing service and food!",

When I think of Caribbean food, I don't really think \"vegetarian-friendly\" but Kaya does a really great job of blasting that misconception to smithereens.  I very much enjoyed the veggie Cuban sandwich - I have had sauteed mushrooms and cheese on bread many times in my life, but never has it been so delicious! The black bean spread is super flavorful and it makes for a wonderful sandwich experience. The chips are great too, and the cilantro-lime dressing from the salad makes the perfect dipping sauce for everything.  The salad itself is a little plain - basically just mixed greens and pepitas. But man, that dressing is good! The other lackluster item was the veggie paella. It was less flavorful overall, and there was hardly any pineapple. Due to time in transit, the rice had clumped up quite a bit. It also lacked the crispy crust I expect on a paella.  Looking at Kaya's menu, I'm intrigued to go check it out in person, but I'll have to save it for a special occasion (it's pretty pricey). I wish the veggie cuban was on their regular menu - it's sooooo good!",

The saffron rice is special too, and complements the flavors really well. And, unlike most curries in Thai restaurants, Kaya's is vegan (among a few other amazing sounding menu items)!  Great happy hour deal, although I wish it was still 5-7pm instead of 4:30-6:30pm - that half hour does make a difference when you get off work at 6!",

    "text": "Made reservations for 7pm on a Saturday evening but found myself a bit hungrier at an earlier time and walked in to a fairly empty restaurant at 6:30pm to bump my reservation up.  They gladly seated my boyfriend and I and promptly served us.   This is exactly the kind of place a San Francisco raised and Los Angeles based Yelper is looking for when they're visiting Pittsburgh! It's Caribbean food set in what i believe is the cultural district of Pittsburgh.  The atmosphere is cool, sexy, fun, and semi romantic.  There's a full bar, dim lights, and a bunch of island like paintings on the wall, and some other unique decorations.  Started off with the JAMAICAN JERK WINGS. Woo! This is spicyyyy. The range of spices coasting the wings somehow burst in your mouth as fast as the heat does.  8 wings come plated on a cilantro cream dip which i assume is supposed to cool your mouth a bit and balance the power of the spices but it didn't do as good of a trick as my 2 glasses of iced water did to fight the burn. Good stuff though!  We split the BEEF BARBACOA TACOS and although we didn't ask them to, they actually split the dish for us assuming we were sharing. These are very large tacos on a flour tortilla.  I didn't find anything special about them. A bit bland to me. They were around $17 so I'd pass on this next time and try something else.  All desserts are $6.50.  We ordered the trio of sorbets to cleanse our palates.  I was taken by the unusual variety of sorbets but  was sad to hear they ran out of the nectarine sorbet. Instead we had the: CARROT LIME SORBET - wow. this was revolting. MANGO CARDAMON - interesting.. not bad, but not my fav. DULCE DE LECHE ICE CREAM - fantastic! All sorbets/ice cream scoops come on top of a mini tart :)  Our bill came up to around $50 (including a pint of Ocktoberfest beer) for 2 people. Will come again next time i'm in the area!! Thanks Pittsburgh Yelpers for leading me to a great restaurant! 4 stars for a great appealing and different menu, the alcohol, atmosphere, and the service.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for Kaya, as people seem to really like this place. On top of that, I've had some great Caribbean food in the past. Not here, however.   If there are ever fish tacos on a menu, I order them. So I've had my fair share of tacos. The wait was long, and we began to wonder if they had forgotten about our orders. We were finally served. Even on a hungry stomach, I found the tacos to be tasteless. At $17, I was a bit shocked.  None of us were very impressed with our dishes, or the waiter, who was neglectful and curt.  There are some great restaurants in Pittsburgh, but Kaya isn't one of them.",

    "text": "I ate here for brunch this past weekend with my girlfriend and her parents for Father's Day.  We had made reservations earlier in the week for when Kaya opened and I am glad that we did as the restaurant seemed to fill up quickly shortly after we arrived.  We decided to start off our brunch by splitting the conch fritters.  There were seven conch balls that were served on top of a tropical tarter sauce that contained capers.  The conch was nice and crispy and paired well with the slightly salty tarter sauce.  For my entree I decided upon the slow roasted pork benedict.  After a long wait of about 70 minutes after being seated, it finally arrived.  Even though I generally do not like cornbread, I enjoyed the play on Eggs Benedict by using the cornbread as the English muffin and pork instead of the ham.  It tasted wonderful as well with the pork being tender and juicy while the lime hollandaise sauce had a good flavor to it.  The sides were good to as they made a sweet and savory mixture with the hash browns mixed in with pineapple chunks.  Several times during the wait for our entrees the waitress apologized to us and even took the step of notifying the manager that our food took a long time, without us saying a word about it. After the meal the manager came over to us and apologized herself and comped two of the meals, once again without us having said anything.  From that I would have to say that they have some pretty good customer service.  The bottom line for me is that I have been here many times before and will be headed back again.  Kaya has both interesting and tasty dishes that you will not find anywhere else in the city and I was more than impressed with their customer service this past visit.",

    "text": "Checked this place out on a Sunday night with a friend from college, and a co-resident.    Food (8.0/10) = started off with the Jamaican jerk chicken wing appetizers.  When I go back to kaya, this is all I'm going to order.  Absolutely loved it.  The cilantro cream sauce is the best.  I was scraping the plate with the edge of my knife trying to get every ounce of that sauce.  If I wasn't dining with my friends, I would've licked the plate clean like a dog.  Also ordered the fish tacos since it was the most mentioned item on yelp.  The fish itself was nicely done.  Tilapia.  Crispy.  Moist.  Soft.  The only thing weird about the flavor profile was the thousand island dressing in the taco.   It wasn't bad...just felt out of place?  The quantity was a bit overboard as well.  3 big tacos on a platter for $17.  Two tacos would've been just perfect.  This seems to be a recurring formula for restaurant success in Pittsburgh = large quantities of food per order (other examples:  Pamela's, Church Brew).    Ambiance (7.0/10) = we sat outside.  Strip district is really dead at night.  First time I visited the strip at night.  The surroundings felt like a post-apocalyptic movie, such as I am Legend with Will Smith.  Service (7.5/10) = felt a little awkward whenever our waitress interacted with us.  Not sure what it was.  She was still nice though.    Overall opinion = fish tacos (most mentioned item on Yelp) is done well by the folks at Kaya, but that thousand island dressing...it bothers me.  If you haven't had it, I'd still try it out.  The real winner, the gold medalist, the award winning dish of Kaya has to be the Jamaican Jerk Chicken wings.  The skin is crispy.  The wings are juicy.  And that amazing cilantro cream sauce!  The folks at Kaya should consider opening up a small wings shop in Oakland, just selling this one dish and beer.  The college kids would eat this up.",

    "text": "Great Strip District bar and restaurant!  The ambiance was causal, urban, caribbean.  The music was not too loud, creating a relaxing atmosphere for a late afternoon (3pm) meal.    The service was prompt and attentive.  Bethany seated me immediately and checked in with me frequently throughout the meal!  The general manager (Monica? I believe?) was very pleasant.  There was a slight problem with the timing of one of my dishes and the general manger handled the minor setback graciously and professionally.  Thank you!  The food was delicious!!!! I had the basil infused margarita.  It was not a sweet drink (which I like) and the basil added a refreshing after taste. The conch corn chowder was perfect!!! I have never had conch and I am so glad that my first experience with conch was pleasant- I will definitely experiment more with it.  I ended my meal with the Kaya Burger.  Everything I read online was True... It's a good burger! The fried eggs was drizzled perfectly from the bun and the special sauce added tremendous flavor.  I did not have to add salt/pepper/ketchup to anything.  All of the dishes were ready to eat as is.    Cheers to a great meal at Kaya!   Only one critique: one of the staff members began sweeping. I respect and understand her efforts to clean up during this down time just  before the 5pm happy hour rush hits.  But, I wish she had waited before pulling back the chairs and sweeping both tables DIRECTLY flanking me.  Kicking up dust from a broom on either side of meanwhile eating was not pleasant.  If she could have stayed one table distance away with the dust/broom, I would have appreciated that courtesy.",

It's got a little heat to it so be prepared for some spice but a great appetizer to share with the group can certainly serve a group of four people easily. Love the acidity as well great balance  to the spice.  I then had the caulk corn chowder which was absolutely amazing. The portion was definitely a bowl and could've been split between two people. But makes great leftovers for lunch tomorrow. My wife had the spicy tortilla soup. But no it was not that spicy. The server even suggested bringing a standard sour cream as well as their other specialty cilantro sour cream.  I had the paella with seafood. This is just a great dish all around. No complaints at all by me. In the shrimp was cooked to perfection. Again the portion was huge.  My wife had the fish tacos. And it came with three very large tacos. Again a great portion size for the price.  Our server was also awesome she checked in at the right times and always knew exactly what to say.   Great meal at a great price, and it never seems to disappoint.  By this point we were so stuffed didn't even have room for the desert.  Oh yeah I forgot about the two glasses of wine.",

    "text": "This place is always packed with people-a sure sign they're doing something right-and they certainly are! My friends and I arrived a little after 8:00 PM on a Friday night and the entire restaurant was full of people. After waiting near the hostess stand for no longer than ten minutes some seats opened up at the bar, we were in! From that point forward it was a 5-star dining experience. We were greeted by such friendly bartenders who offered us samples of the beer and wine we were interested in. The hostess even came over to let us know she was keeping her eye out for an opening table.   Food: Everything was so fresh, delicious, flavorful, and unlike any placed we've dined in Pittsburgh in quite some time. Caribbean cuisine at its finest. For starters we ordered the Yucatan Hot Bean Dip with House-made Chips & the Lobster Tacos. The dip came out sizzling hot, a blend of beans, cheese and spices baked to perfection served with their house-made chips that really pack a punch! Quite spicy. We could have eaten the dip by the spoonful we were practically drooling over it. The Lobster tacos are served on three mini hard shells with cabbage and some other fixings. Very substantial amount of Lobster so you're getting your money's worth. My friend loved them-high quality lobster. For entrees we ordered the Jerked chicken thighs and the Caribbean Rainbow Salad. Jerk chicken was seasoned to perfection, very large portion served with two sides. The salad was enormous and comes served like a chopped salad with all the ingredients separated for you to toss on your own. So fresh and flavorful, close to 20 different ingredients in total. Overall dinner was fabulous, not a single complainant, and we will certainly be back again. It's very unlike us to not even look at the dessert menu--I guess it's safe to say we were completely satisfied and didn't need to consume one more thing. One additional bonus is the menu is seasonal which keeps it interesting and us coming back for more.   Ambiance: Very unique Caribbean decor inside. Lots of wooden figurines and statues around the restaurant. Darker, romantic lighting. Caribbean music. Restaurant is on the smaller side but they pack in a lot of tables inside, outside and there's a long bar inside that seats about 20 people. Very cozy. The upstairs bathroom even has a beautiful mural painted along the walls.      Overall service was great, food came out quick & always delicious, we loved every moment of our dining experience here. Can't wait to come back for more.",

It's often times a slow and long dinner process because there are so many of us, but the service was great at Kaya, and I didn't notice that it took much longer for our large group to eat, than many of the smaller groups there.    We all started off with drinks, and all of the cocktails I tasted were delicious and high end (causing the prices to be high).  Their Dark and Stormy was amazing, and something totally unique.    The food was also amazing, I had the jerked pork quesadillas, and not only were they delicious, but they were huge!  Often times, when you order quesadillas at a restaurant, you have to get an appetizer to supplement your meal, but this was definitely not the case at Kaya.  On a side note, their chips are heavenly, and while probably not the healthiest, they really didn't seem all that greasy and gross.    We were all too full to get dessert, but I would love to go back and try some sometime.    The majority of the meals were under $20, and even the more expensive meat options were under $30, so I would say a good price for the quality of food you're eating.    I would definitely recommend Kaya to anybody",

    "text": "I can't believe I've never reviewed Kaya!  Kaya is a Pittsburgh staple that has been around years before the 'burgh became a big foodie town, and is still going strong.  Kaya's food is fresh, full of flavor, and a great value.  I'm particularly partial to the Crunchy Fish Tacos - these are 3 tacos full of fried fish goodness, topped with plenty of veggies.  And the drinks!  Oh my - strong, varied, and delicious.  Plus they even offer non-alcoholic mixed bevvies if you are so inclined.  Reservations are a must on busy nights, which you can make online at Open Table.  Parking is limited in the Strip, and if you do park on the produce terminal side, there is a charge (bring cash!).",

    "text": "I've been to Kaya for brunch and the vegetarian prix fixe dinner.   Brunch was pretty good and included Bloody Mary's, conch hush puppies, Eggs Benedict, and huevos rancheros. We sat at the bar because the host said the other tables were for reservations. The bartender did a great job checking on us and getting food to us in a very timely manner. Now onto the food- The bloody's were pretty good, although the cucumber infused vodka was almost too strong of a flavor, even for a Bloody Mary. The hush puppies, and pretty much everything, except some of grilled pineapple, was devoured.   The prix fixe dinner I had was AMAZING. Every dish, besides dessert, was made with peas. And although I know I *like* peas, I *loved* every dish they brought to the table. I wanted to lick the plates clean, but I refrained. We ordered two of the dinners, so we were able to try both options for every part of the meal. We ended up trying eight different plates of food. Among the most memorable was a soup, a fake pork dish, and a chocolate mouse s'mores type thing. There was a strawberry and pretzel dessert that we both did not enjoy, and although the wine pairing was great, the last wine seemed to be almost a liqueur and was too strong for me to drink, let a lone finish.  I will definitely be going back for the prix fixe menu as soon as I can, and if you enjoy delicious food, I recommend checking it out. (Third Wednesday of every month.)",

    "text": "Visited Kaya for the first time yesterday with a friend who loves the place.  It was around 3:30 and basically empty with the exception of a couple sitting at the bar, so we decided we'd also just take our place there.  The menu is small (1 page), but theres a lot of variety to choose from.  Reluctantly, I ordered the Kaya burger (I'm not really a burger fan and DEFINITELY not a bacon fan) because my friend gave me a couple of her faves and the burger was right on top, so I took her advice and went with that, cooked Med Well, with a side of sweet potato fries, and let me tell you, i ate every. last. bite.  it was that good.  So kudos to the cooks in the kitchen for making this hater of red meat and bacon clean her plate with no regrets!  We also ordered a pitcher of white sangria, which was OK.. I mean, we finished it so it wasn't bad, but I've had better (which is the only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5.. but I've been told that the other drinks are amazing so maybe there will be a review update in my future).   All in all, I really liked Kaya.  The theme and the decor was cool I thought, and the service was good.  Not fabulous, not horrible.. just your basic good service, and thats ok with me.  I was with a friend and enjoying stuffing my face with everything that I would normally never touch, so I wasn't looking for a chatty bartender anyway. Thumbs up, Kaya!",

    "text": "In the middle of the previous week, I had yet another concert to attend at Altar Bar, and with gigs come visits to restaurants near the venues. Kaya had been on my brain for months, and I was on a mission of sorts to try them out, but all I knew was that they were on Smallman Street.   I strolled down Smallman, a road that for the first quarter or so is pure industrial loneliness, particularly after dark. I passed Kelly O's: Closed as was Smallman Street Deli. I almost went into Marty's Market since it's new, but Kaya had me under a spell, whispering to me on a soggy Wednesday night as watery, formless headlights floated towards me, \"Before your show, you must come and taste...the Caribbean, boy...\"  But I couldn't find her!  Dodging cars, I trudged forward. Knowing that I was getting close to Altar Bar, I was about to settle for another nearby restaurant...until I heard those rhythms, those beats...  It was Kaya, and she was waiting for me.   I opened the door and immediately felt as if I had entered a houngan or shaman's converted urban hideout. Masks of wood and dolls of straw hung in the gloomy, sultry, but lively and welcoming atmosphere. Businessmen dined amongst slackers. Professors and students ate alongside...me, the anomaly.   Autumn, my server, casually approached my table, her eyes smiling, glistening in the brown darkness.   \"I looked up the menu online, I already know what I want,\" I told her.  \"Shoot,\" she replied.  \"I want the Cuban Sandwich.\" I didn't see it mentioned or photographed on Yelp yet, and it was inexpensive.   \"Dining alone?\" Autumn was perplexed by my solitude.   \"Well yeah. I'm meeting friends at a show.\"  \"Wiz Khalifa!\" she blurted. Pittsburgh's hip-hop star and lover of Mary Jane was in town that night.  \"No, it's Sonata Arctica.\"  \"Who?\"  \"They're a power metal band from Finland.\"  \"Oh. Ummm, is that your scene?\"  \"I guess.\"  \"Oh, I'm sorry.\"  \"No, it's cool. I'm just not used to it being put that way.\"  \"Metallica changed everything you know?\"  \"Yes, they did, didn't...they?\"  Just as the conversation was getting...awkward (There was a tension between her and I for some reason, initially only. Hipster vs. metalhead?), I requested a side dish of fried plantains. Alas, there was no such thing on the menu that evening, but with a desire to please, Autumn rushed back to the kitchen and brought me two plantain chips.   \"These are on the house,\" she assured. And crispy and sweet they were. Immediately, our dissimilar musical tastes became irrelevant and all that mattered was our shared love of food.   \"It's cool that you like plantains,\" she gushed. \"I don't know why we don't sell them. Maybe next time.\"  That's when she recommended the Conch Chowder to accompany my sandwich, and a fine luncheon foil it was. Not having ever had conch before, I wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised to find that it was akin to a clam that was more \"to the teeth\" if you dig. The milky broth never coated my tongue enough to miss the conch's oceanic flavors, nor did it allow the subtle nibble of the poblano peppers to go undetected. Sweet potatoes and corn merely disappeared and resurfaced in the pale liquid, frolicking like children in a swimming pool, adding texture and sugar to the warm, solacing, tropical stew, rounding it out if you will.   Guilefully dimidiated on a bias, plated in a manner that creates the illusion of height, and served with a bowl of shocking orange chipotle aioli and some sour pickle chips, Kaya's Cuban Sandwich is street food morphed into haute cuisine through presentation alone. Tastewise, it is genius immaterial of where or how it is served and eaten. The turkey, pork, ham, Swiss cheese, and mustard are stacked in a deliberate sequence between with the flaky cuts of elongated baguettesque bread. I applied the pickles at Autumn's request and dredged each half of the sandwich through the ochreous, spicy cream before every bite, experiencing grains, sugar, salty proteins, dill, sharp cheese, and piquancy as actualized in the most exotic yet humble grinder you're likely to find in Pittsburgh.   Once again looking to my mod, new, platonic acquaintance for guidance, I chose as my dessert (Kaya doesn't list them online for some reason) the Pistachio Pumpkin Pie. Served with a tantalizingly tart quenelle of cream cheese ice cream, a caramel glaze, and shards of pistachio brittle, it was apparent that \"pie\" was a misnomer. No, upon seeing and tasting this mildly decadent pastry, it seemed more like a dense, raisin-studded muffin in composition. By itself, this pumpkin cake would humbly satisfy a mid-morning hunger with coffee, but when paired with such creative companions in the aforementioned candy and frozen dairy product, it became a stroke of the sublime. With that, my affair in the Lesser Antilles had ended. Kaya, you haunt me...  P.S. Autumn was efficient, accommodating, adorable, groovy, and didn't charge me a dime for the chowder.",

Although it had good flavor, the tomato seemed to overpower the deliciousness of all the other ingredients, but it was still pretty good.

The bar was pretty busy at 6 on a Wednesday so I believe this place gets crowded on a weekend.  We had the Mango Mai Tai, Caipirinha, Rum Swizzle Punch, and Mojito and the Punch and Mojito were our faves.  As for dinner - we started with the Crispy Calamari that had this wonderful pineapple-chili glaze.  Not too spicy and not too sweet.  It was really a wonderful combination of flavors.  I then had the Tropical Paella and my husband had the Wild Alaskan Halibut.  Both were decent dishes, but nothing to write home about.  Kaya was a place I would go back to for drinks and appetizers (during happy hour), but I would skip the dinner.",

The food was ok, but over-priced for things that we didn't really like. We were in Pittsburgh for only a few days, and I really regret that we wasted one of our meals on Kaya.  We started with the beignets. I thought they were good, my sister did not. I ordered the fish tacos, which were ok. Unfortunately, they were smothered in over-sauced slaw that completely overwhelmed the taste of the fish. My sister had the rainbow salad which was the same thing: way too many tastes, drowning out any enjoyment of the flavors. I think the food would be much better if they focused on highlighting quality ingredients.   This place wasn't terrible, but neither of us particularly enjoyed our food and we don't plan on coming back.",

I ordered two entrees because I was worried by favorite dish might disappoint and I wanted to try something new and not reget it. So, to hedge my bets, I got both my favorite Jamaican Green Curry and a new item, Seasonal Vegetable Paella. Both were good, but the JGC is better.

I'll agree with others that the tables are quite close together, and we did occasionally struggle to converse over the rowdy Happy Hour crowd. The Happy Hour deal is amazingly good--half off every alcoholic beverage in the joint. I tried The Graduate, which was strong enough that I actually declined a second drink.  Chas was our server, and he was incredible--if this review were for him, he'd get 5 stars. When we sat down as a party of 3, he took the liberty to point out which appetizers came in 3s. He also promised to give us last call on Happy Hour (and delivered), and performed all the regular duties of a server admirably. But he truly went above and beyond by actually recommending how we could repurpose our leftover paella by reheating in a pan with some eggs. Brunch paella is amazing, for the record.  The food was all pretty good. The skirt steak tacos were delicious, the fish tacos were very fresh (the slaw does not contain mayo, a downright miracle in PGH), and the paella was great. The alligator wasn't fantastic--definitely have had better. The corn and lentil beignets were tasty but smaller beignets would have worked better.  I'd definitely come back for Happy Hour for drinks and apps, but the ambiance struggles to match the prices for a sit-down dinner. Chas was so charming that we might give dinner another shot so long as he's working!",

Kaya's happy hour features  1/2 off all single serving drinks and all craft draft beers. What an ideal combination. It is located right in the Strip District on the corner of Smallman and 20th.  Kaya is a Caribbean restaurant and that reflects in its cocktail list. My favorite drink is the Caipirinha. It is the national drink of Brazil with an ingredient list of leblon cachaca, demerara and lime. Confused? Me too. Cachaca is also known pinga or caninha and is Brazil's most commonly distilled alcoholic beverage and it is closest related to rum.",

    "text": "We went to Kaya last night for dinner.  We were seated outside which was great!  Make reservations because it's definitely a really busy restaurant.    We really did not enjoy the food.  We got the guacamole which comes in a really small bowl, with basic Tostitos chips, and ends up costing $11.  We ended up asking the waitress to give us more or at least fill the bowl up to the top.  She said these were their portion sizes, did go back to the restaurant and added maybe a spoonful more, and then said she'll have to charge us if we still wanted more.  I understand but probably a little more than half an avocado was used in that guacamole bowl.   My husband got the jerk chicken wings.  He said it grew on him eventually but it wasn't spicy.  I believe the sauce that comes with it is cilantro aioli? which makes dipping the jerk chicken in it taste even more mild.  The sauce was pretty yummy.  I got the vegetarian Caribbean rainbow salad with tofu because the description sounds SO yummy.  It was not.  It tasted bland and there wasn't any dressing on it.  I typically don't add dressing to my salads -- a little olive oil and lemon goes a long way.  But this salad was just tasteless and it was the first time where I wished for dressing.  The drinks were yummy!  We both tried a cocktail and both were delicious.  I would go there for drinks and apps but not dinner.",

The first thing that I usually notice is how many vegetarian options a restaurant has, and Kaya did not let me down! It is rare that I can find so many things that I am able to eat that I actually have a difficult choice deciding.   I ended up getting the tempura avocado tacos. It had jalapenos, carrots, cucumber and cilantro. I also got a side of the sweet potato fries, which I have to say I did not love. They were just too oily. The tacos were great though! Very filling. The only problem was I asked the waiter if they were spicy at all and he said no, which was a lie! Twas spicy! It seemed like everything might be a little spicy here, however, so beware if you do not like a bit of a kick.",

    "text": "Kamayan Review Only  Every Tuesday, Kaya does Kamayan Night.  It is a traditional Filipino feast where the food is laid out in front of you on top of banana leaves, and you just go HAM on it.  No utensil and no rule.  Our server said Kamayan at Kaya has a Caribbean twist to it.  While not all the dishes are made traditionally, the kamayan is pretty damn close.  We also observed that every table had a least one Filipino in the party.  If they come back to this, that's good enough for me!  The presentation was mouthwatering.  We watched as they set up the whole table, dish by dish.  The amount of food is too much to deal.  We did our best and were still able to pack two full containers home.  My favorites are the fried fish and the adobo chicken wings.  I've heard the fried fish is on the regular menu.  I also love the avocado salad.  The pineapple/mango dipping sauce goes well with the lumpia.  The shrimp and mussels topped everywhere were the icing to the cake.  Kamayan is a really fun way to get a glimpse into the Filipino cuisine, which is often underrepresented in the US.",

The first time I stuck with a glass of wine which was wonderful. This most recent time, I got a glass of Pinot Noir and the Tiki #7 which was a fruit blend; it was delicious! Also, I tried the tropical guacamole which I'm not a fan of only because I don't like mango. However, I got the fried chicken sandwich with waffle fries and found it to be very good. While I wish I had more flavor and less spice in the chicken, it was still super crispy and tasty. The waffle fries were amazing especially with the cucumber cream sauce. I highly recommend the fried chicken in whatever fashion you get it.   The vibe of this place is really chill with dimmed lights after 5pm. Tables and bar are parallel to one another. Oh, and the napkins/towelettes in the bathrooms are amazing! They're thick and super soft. Yea, I couldn't leave them out of this review.",

I'm not a fan of spicy or seafood, but I did enjoy the conch and corn chowder, sweet potato fries, and chicken wings. The fried conch fritters were super chewy and the jerk chicken sandwich I got had super extra dry chicken and was hard to eat. The paella was also a big hit at my table. It seems they change their menu quite a bit but their HH (beginning at 4:30pm) seems good. They also seem to have good specials (like Filipino special dinners and fried chicken nights) that I'd recommend people trying.",

Finally after walking in again for the zillionth time on a Sunday afternoon, the bar was empty!   The hubby ordered the Cuban and I, of course, got the Chicken and Waffle. I am a sucker for chicken and waffles; it's hard for me to ever get anything else when there's chicken and waffles on the menu. So the food tasted exactly as I had imagined their food to taste like: rich, bold, flavorful, and oh so yummy. However, I felt the food was a bit too rich after a while. Halfway through the meal, it left me craving something fresh. Despite this, I absolutely loved Kaya's take on the chicken and waffle. The chicken had a spicy batter and the dish was topped with green onions and bacon, which added a little extra punch of flavor and differing textures to add some contrast to the dish. The Cuban was a simple sandwich, but it was done right. The bread was toasted to the perfect level of crispiness.  With brunch being this good, I am looking forward to coming back and trying out dinner!",

Drinks are always reasonable and we've always had incredibly friendly service, but it always comes down to the food here.  Quite frankly, I haven't had something off of their menu that I didn't like. Of course the fried chicken night is amazing - not the best I've ever had but certainly the best in the Burgh. Specifically love when they have coconut rice as a side. The pita with hot sauce is fantastic as well.  I regularly order the Jamaican jerk wings with the cilantro sour cream, the kaya burger, the skirt steak, lobster tacos, or the black bean dip - not all at once obviously.  I've only made it to dessert once or twice, wasn't big on their ice cream as it was more ice than cream.  The 5 stars is for consistency and overall food quality.",

I ordered the crispy fish tacos (which was always recommended from my friend) and I'm so glad I did! I never order fish when I go out to eat, but it was a Friday in Lent, so I figured I'd go for it.

    "text": "Short version:  Amazing food.  Stellar service.  That said, my first helpful tip is you should take the time to make a reservation.  We naively thought that on a humid Sunday evening (very much on the early side--as in around 5 p.m.) that no reservation would be necessary.  UH, WRONG!  The greeter and host in charge did the appropriate and diplomatic thing of saying (and rightly so) that there were no tables available for a party our size.  It was totally \"on us\" for not taking the time to make a reservation.  So, we left (at first) because we hadn't taken the time to make a reservation.  But, here's what makes Kaya a stand out.  We (our party) left since the first available table was about 2 hours down the road from when we'd arrived.  \"Oh well, we thought.\" So, while we were standing outside considering our options, an amazing thing happened.  Someone (thank you thoughtful someone) phoned in a cancellation.  The host (Kurt!) actually took the time to come outside the restaurant (where we had been standing trying to figure out what to do next) and called out to us as we were headed to our cars.  This is going the extra mile!  He didn't have to do that.  For sure other folks would show up and fill the tables.  Kurt is an example of the way-awesome-worth-it-allness of Kaya.  The quality of attention and care you receive as a customer starts not just at the door (where the host's back is actually to the outside window where we were standing--so this meant he actually cared enough to pay attention), but is part and parcel of the entire experience you receive as a customer at Kaya.  Our food was wonderful.  Our service was also stellar (thank you to our amazing waitress named Adrienne--sorry, not sure I spelled this correctly).  But, seriously, we were with friends who we only get to see once a year.  We picked Kaya for the cuisine and wonderful \"whimsy\" of ambience and food--and our experience was absolutely.  Kudos to the Kaya team who made our evening so lovely, lovely, lovely.",

It's tucked behind this...sketchy-ish street where you can park your car along the \"street\". We sat outdoors on a beautiful weekend.   We ordered the Jamaican Jerk Wings, Ahi Tuna Poke Bowl, and Blue Bay Mussels. Food came surprisingly fast, we didn't have to wait too long, considering all our dishes had a decent amount of meat in them. The Ahi Tuna Poke Bowl was amazing, fish tasted decently fresh, and everything else in the bowl complimented the tuna so well. Mussels weren't too bad, nothing to complain about; although,the portion was huge. We were sort of disappointed at the Wings. The Jamaican Jerk flavour wasn't special in anyway, and it felt like the Wings were a bit overcooked - meat was dry and a bit on the tougher side.  I remember ordering a Margarita and it was amazing, but I couldn't find the drinks menu on their website.",

The menu had alot of really good sounding Caribbean things, but  it didnt taste Caribbean. It tasted like my caucasian aunt Brenda made it. Maybe we just ordered the wrong things. The bill was only 38$, so i wasnt expecting a four course culinary masterpiece, BUT let's just say it didn't cure my Caribbean food fix. Maybe i'm just spoiled from New Orleans Caribbean cuisine.

The seafood paella was a huge portion, lots of chunks, which was good, but incredibly bland. The jerk chicken torta was probably the worst thing - a very dry piece of chicken on some bread, and there was no flavor. Really couldn't tell that it was anything but some grilled or boiled chicken. I blame my brother for even thinking we should order this as it didn't sound appealing in its menu description either, which is a testament to their menu-writing at least.  When I think of Caribbean food, I think a lot more flavor than what was here. But it would still be a good place to gran some tasty drinks and some small fried snacks.",

The prices seemed a little high for some of their dishes but then again they were mostly fish and fish can be on the pricey side. I ordered the half pound of shrimp from the appetizer section and it came with a fair amount (maybe about 15) shrimp for $12. It was just what I was looking for and cooked very well. The cocktails looked very good but didn't try. Would definitely return when I'm craving seafood/Caribbean inspired dishes!",

When we first walked in, we were greeted by the aroma of fresh citrus from the bartender squeezing fresh lemons- off to a great start! It isn't the largest space, but there are probably about 20 tables. We went right at 12pm on a Thursday, and it was about half full. I ordered the Fried Chicken Sandwich - Nashville Hot. It was super spicy and tasty- the flavor of the lard complimented the cayenne flavor perfectly, and the pickles, of course, were the cherry on top. Though very tasty, the sesame bun wasn't adding anything to it. It was falling apart, so I ended up not eating the bun after about 3 bites, but nonetheless, it was still delicious. Service was excellent. Our server recognized we didn't necessarily have \"time to spare,\" so he delivered our checks very quickly and had us out the door in about 50 minutes from the time we sat down. I definitely recommend making a visit to Kaya- a lot of people around us were eating salads, and they looked delicious! I can't wait to return!",

They offer a few staple things that you'll always see on the menu while also changing up the menu to always offer a few new items. Non of the dishes really WOW me, most of them I can get at other good restaurants around Pittsburgh.  As a restaurant that's part of the Big Burrito Company you'll find they use fresh and local ingredients when possible, which is always a plus in my book.  The outside seating area is a nice plus BUT they do not allow dogs if you are dining outside. This seems a little ridiculous to me seeing as how it's a casual setting & you are on the sidewalk.  Overall its worth eating at Kaya at least once.",

    "text": "This is a bit of a one-off review.  I enjoy Kaya.  If I was being objective about the restaurant overall, the review would probably be a solid 4 stars...but the thing is...  I just ate the best thing I've had in 2018 there the other night.  And I feel like all things considered that has to make it a 5 star review.  Compounding this is the strong possibility that the best thing I ate in 2017 was ALSO here; a Caribbean re-imagining of poutine that knocked my socks off.  So I'm not really REALLY reviewing Kaya so much as one spectacular dish on Kaya's menu.  I can't vouch for all the food.  Some might be good, some might not be to your liking...  But this past week I had their \"Fried Chicken Tuna Poke Bowl\": sticky rice, yuzu, Fresno, mayo, pineapple, cucumber, mango, edamame, avocado, seaweed, sesame, tobiko, garlic, cilantro...all of this is stuff I loooooove.  But...but...what's missing from this description is the fried chicken.  I know you're wondering, how does THAT play with this asian adjacent, Hawaiian \"fish salad\"???  Like the right hand of a ragtime piano player: syncopated, crisp, bright and joyful.  Off the poke beat perhaps, but completely and satisfyingly fitting into the gaps, the element of crunch otherwise missing from the dish, a comfortable savor in the midst of the tangy acidity and asian spice.  And, best of all, it's the bowl.  The poke is served in a bowl MADE of fried chicken.  Right-hand-to-god I'm not sure what could have made it better...bacon?  I don't know.  I probably would have collapsed at that point.   When I ordered it our server scribbled it onto her pad, a slight smile creasing the corner of her mouth.  Nodding almost imperceptibly she said, \"good choice\" and I knew this was no polite, \"make the customer feel good about his selection,\" patter, no well-practiced rote response.  She and I shared something that day.  We communed mind to mind and her message was...\"oh, you are going to enjoy this...\" then \"get out of my head...don't make this creepy.\"  I don't know how frequently Kaya changes their menu.  But I know this:   Possibly the best thing I ate in all of 2017, the poutine, was not on the menu.  So you owe it to yourself to try this before the menu changes.   *A note about the chicken-bowl...it was a bit overdone (a tad dry).  I'm assuming it was pounded very thin and wrapped around a bowl or form prior to frying, which meant it was super easy to overcook when made crispy enough to hold the shape.  THAT.  DIDN'T.  DETRACT.  But by way of coming completely clean about the experience, if you try this because you're a fried chicken purist, you'll miss the magic.",

The host/hostesses and waiters are often rude, uppity, and the least accommodating group of people I've ever met. My last two visits were frustrating, to say the least. I limit my visits to Kaya only because we always leave feeling like we're either an inconvenience or not good enough to be seated. Sat at the bar for an hour with 3 open tables visible. Like I said, I only go back for the food, but not for much longer if the staff doesn't change their attitude.",

I had the fish tacos and my boyfriend had the jerk pork quesadilla. They were both flavorful and incredibly filling.   I love eating down at the Strip District in general and Kaya fits the bill of most retaurants down that way - casual, small but good. If you're into the idea of American-meets-Carribean-meets-Spanish cuisine, you should definitely try Kaya.",

I enjoy the Sangria especially, but if you're not into that (who ARE you???) the draft list is pretty rad too! The seafood is just phenomenal, but their offerings include some knockout vegetarian dishes and stellar jerked pork and chicken entrees.

The menu is as lively as the walls, with creative dishes like Tempura Avocado tacos, corn/lentil beignets, Jamaican jerk wings, and my personal favorite the Yucatan bean dip with homemade chips.

    "text": "I have only been here a few times but I feel confident in my feelings toward Kaya. It's a  Big Burrito restaurant which owns restaurants like Casbah, Mad Mex, and Eleven all very respected restaurants in Pittsburgh. Kaya is Island themed and falls in the mid to upper price range of the several Big Burrito restaurants.   Between my wife and I we have tried a few dishes on the dinner menu and all of them have been delicious. What I really want to talk about is their Sunday brunch menu.   My wife and I happened to be in the strip on a Sunday and wondered into Kaya for a little lunch. We had the Eggs Benedict and Fried Chicken & Waffle. The Eggs Benedict was good but what I crave is the Chicken and Waffles.   A large Belgian style waffle with spicy breaded chicken strips on top. The syrup was extra sweet with what I suspect may have been infused with vanilla to make it extra sweet. The combination of spice breaded chicken and sweet syrup on top of a delicious waffle was about more than mouth could handle. It was so good that you will just have to try it yourself.   Don't miss their weekly happy hour  Mon-Fri 5-7 and if you are there on sunday do yourself a favor and get the chicken and waffles.",

My wife and I ate there tonight and I am sorry, but the only thing we had all night with any taste (seasoning) was the sauce the Conch fritters came with. If there was a bright side, our server was nice enough. 25+ minutes after the appetizer was removed from the table, the entrees arrived, here is the recap: My wife is 7 months pregnant, she eats just about everything in site nowadays and tonight she didn't have the desire to finish her dinner... She had the Jerk pork quesadilla that even she said had ZERO taste. I tasted the pork by itself, and I concur. I had the supposed infamous Kaya burger (medium well)... Where do I begin? The burger was beyond well done, dry and had only the char taste of the grill. The egg was tasteless, cooked too long and thus couldn't run when cut, no doubt because of the far too long of a wait. The bun was from yesterday, the sauce on it had no spice or flavor and how the hell does bacon have no taste?!?!  Look, a lot of places screw up the egg on the burger concept, but this was by far an insult and theft of $15... At only $8 the ENP breakfast burger blows the Kaya burger away! We have been to a few restaurants that screw up either her's or my dish, but both, and for neither to have any taste?... So disappointed!",

I wouldn't really say it's the most authentic Caribbean venue, but they do a good job of incorporating those vibes into a place that people of all backgrounds can enjoy. It stays busy here for a reason. Everyone knows that their Sunday brunch is great.   The service is really good. That's one thing that sets restaurants apart, in my opinion, especially at places that usually have a large crowd. The hostess is such a sweet sweet lady. She checked in with us a couple times to make sure everything was okay. The food was wonderful; it was appealing, flavorful, and very satisfying. The chicken and doughnuts appetizer is a must try. Please find a way to try it. I'll reimburse you if you don't like it... But I know you will. I've also tried the fish tacos, cuban sandwich, and other dishes and I don't have a single complaint.   Make a reservation and go have a great time!",

    "text": "I came here on a Sunday night during my weekend trip to Pittsburgh. It had come recommended by a friend. It's a Caribbean and South American fusion themed restaurant.  The restaurant is aesthetically pleasing and inviting. The restaurant opens up to a seemingly well-stocked bar with recessed lighting under the counter-top illuminating bar stools resembling congo drums. The physical space is small, yet warm and intimate. Kaya would likely make a perfect happy hour and possibly date venue. Their outdoor seating is also nice on a nice warm day and allows you to take in the Strip district while enjoying your meal. Ambiance - (4/5)  The food was a mixed bag. I ordered the Jamaican Jerk wings appetizer and they were tasty. 10 wings for $9. The Jerk seasoning had a nice kick to it and it was perfectly balanced with a palate cooling cilantro cream sauce. They were juicy and well cooked. I would most definitely order these again.  However, I ordered the fish tacos based on the rave reviews on Yelp and was disappointed. The portions are large and for $17, you would expect them to be. The plate came with 3 corn tortillas with generous portions of fried tilapia and coleslaw. I am talking about Cheesecake Factory-sized portions. To be honest, the taste was also not too far off from the Cheesecake Factory's either. Not bad, but definitely not great. I think the huge mounds of coleslaw and the thousand island dressing they called \"spicy creme fraiche\" threw me off. The tilapia and corn tortillas are the True stars of the dish, but they are only masked amongst these other ingredients. Sometimes less is more and I feel like if Kaya eased up on the sauce and slaw, then the dish would benefit overall. The option of getting 2 tacos for reduced price may also be a good idea.  Food - (3.5/5)  Their drink menu is extensive with 12 different mixed drinks and 18 beers on draft. In addition, they host a happy hour Monday through Friday from 5 to 7 pm where draft beers and cocktails are half-off. That's quite the deal and if I lived in Pittsburgh, I would probably be a regular. Drinks - (4/5)  The service was okay. Our waitress was polite, but appeared very disinterested. Maybe it was an off day or a case of the Sundays. The drinks and appetizers came out quickly, but it took another 25-30 minutes before we got our entrees.  Service -  (3/5)  All in all, I still had a positive dining experience at Kaya. If i'm ever back  in town, I would not hesitate to return. However, I was disappointed with the fish tacos and for this reason I will have to give them a 3.5/5 rating.  Overall - (3.5/5)",

The burger was gigantic (I couldn't physically eat it with my hands, rather, I had to dissect it with my fork and knife) and it came with a fried egg, avocado, their Kaya Special Sauce, chihuahua cheese, tomato, bacon, and pickles. I ordered my burger medium rare and I found it cooked a little too much for my tastes. The burger was alright - not mind-blowing, but pretty decent. The fries were a disappointment. I had read such rave reviews about the sweet potato fries, but I found them a bit stale, dry, and bland.   Ambience of the place was very nice - eclectic blend of modern furniture and artwork. Service was very mediocre.",

We came for brunch and got seated at the bar, which was fine. There were 6 of us, so it was a little harder to talk when there was an empty table for 6 with a reservation card on it.

Let me explain the pork and banana sandwich for you from bun to bun: Slice: fluffy baguette red onion cilantro mayo lime slow cooked pulled pork sliced plantains Slice: fluffy baguette **if you're one who enjoys the dynamic duo of savory and sweet - this dandy is for you!  According to our Pittsburgh hostess with the mostess, Rachel C, we HAD to order the sweet potato fries as they were some of the best in the city - and, she added, that they paired nicely with an order of the cilantro mayo. True and True! From the sidewalk looking in this place is extremely unsuspecting - I didn't even realize there was anything there until she swung the door open. Inside sits a Caribbean oasis tucked away in the heart of the Strip District. Warm lighting with a long bar that boasts tiki-style bar chairs and colorful walls. By ordering the \"Todo en Uno\" portion size I was able to have a smaller version of the sandwich with a side.   Rachel informed our crew that Kaya is a great spot for Happy Hours and that in her downtown working days she was a regular;) Next time, Rachel, - you + me + Kaya.",

Imagine Rainforest Cafe as a pre-teen who just realized his parents dressed him funny, so he goes to some random crap store and buys a pair of JNCO jeans to wear with his hawaiian print.  This is sort of what the inside of Kaya feels like.  It wants to be fancy and cool at the same time, but c'mon now... your bar stools look like they're wearing palm tree skirts.  Food: Not good, but edible (lunch).  The paella was dry and looked more like fried rice.  Paella is supposed to be moist, absorbing all the juices of the seafood, white wine, spices that go into making it.  This was more akin to wok-fried rice with mussels and mexican rice mixed in.  The burger was also lacking, with a dried out (although sizable) patty with formless bread to hold the contents together.  For the lunch price point, not bad.  $20 got me a beer and an attempt at what could have been a good dish, tip included.  Would have paid more for a better dish, but won't be coming back for lunch again.",

    "text": "Had my first trip to Kaya this weekend for lunch, a Saturday, and it offered some of the best food that I've had in quite awhile.   Their made from scratch, Jamaican dry-rubbed jerk wings were stellar (our waiter recommended including a chipotle sort of aioli to go along with them, too, which was incredible) and all of our sandwiches and tacos were great. Specifically, we had the Skirt Steak Cemita, the Shrimp Po' Boy, and the Tempura Avocado Bahm Mi tacos. Also saw a killer looking Cuban sandwich come out to an adjacent table, and the paella looked pretty darn good, too.   The customer service was somewhat informal in a homey sort of way, and I enjoyed that the aforementioned wings took an accurately advertised 15 minutes to prepare. This allowed for plenty of time to relax on a hot day with a cold drink in a really nice atmosphere. A particularly nice touch was also the friendly stop-by of the General Manage, Monica. We were all so impressed with the experience that we immediately made reservations for Mother's Day for six, the day before Mother's Day, mind you, and the general manager was kind enough to squeeze us in. We cancelled other plans that we had made and were glad we did.  Can't wait to get back to Kaya again, especially for a happy hour to enjoy some wings, a cold mojito, and whatever else the place is offering. I'm an instant fan.",

    "text": "I've been trying to review Kaya for an embarrassing length of time. I'd start a draft, realize I wasn't doing this place justice, then I'd start over. I realize I'll never be able to summarize how incredible Kaya is, or how delighted it has made me over the years, but I can't leave the Pittsburgh area without attempting to express just how much I love Kaya. There aren't enough available adjectives to describe the food. I always start the party with one of their magical appetizers. The lentil and corn beignets are always impressive, lightly fried and served with a wonderfully spicy green curry sauce. Perfect for sharing. The Yucatan hot bean dip with homemade chips may be the most addictive item on the menu. The rich, spicy-ish, slightly cheesy dip with those magnificently salty chips will make it difficult to carry on a conversation with your dining companions. You'll be too busy hollowing out that tasty dip. The tofu cracklins are enough to astound even the non-vegetarians with the chipotle honey BBQ flavor and crispy texture. The field green salad is served with possibly the world's best salad dressing. This lime cilantro vinaigrette should be bottled and sold. To me, specifically. With all of the amazing vegetarian appetizers, it's almost too difficult to save enough room for an entree.  But I do. Oooohhhh, I do. Jerked. Tofu. Tacos. If Kaya only had one item on their menu and this was it, it would still be my favorite restaurant. Ever. Fresh, soft, warm tortillas with a mind blowing cilantro cream sauce, avocado, a cabbage slaw, peppers and tofu prepared so expertly you'll swear you might cry...but that's probably the jerk seasoning talking. Your order comes with three tacos, and they are large. The third one is perfect for lunch the following day, although you'll be sad you aren't actually eating it at Kaya. The Jamaican green curry vegetable dish is a spicy little number with saffron rice, potatoes, squash, peas, and pineapple. Each time you get a fork full with that pineapple covered in the creamy, fiery green curry, your eyes just might roll back in your head with delight. The veggie Kaya burger is a wondrous experience. Homemade veggie patty (no phoning it in with some frozen Boca burger here!), avocado, pickles, tomato, chihuahua cheese and a sunny side up egg. It's messy. It's large. It's heavenly. And with a side of sweet potato fries it's perfection.  The brunch menu seems to change often. Just know that you can't go wrong with any of the Sunday offerings, whether it be chocolate chip waffles or huevos rancheros. Just be sure to try the Vampiro cocktail, with tequila and grapefruit juice.  Cocktails at Kaya are inventive and exciting. Cocktail menu changes quite often and during happy hour everything is half price! My favorite drink I've experienced here has to be the mango Mai Thai. For the winter months, they've traded mango for pomegranate. Which is just fine with this girl. The cherry spritzer served in a champagne flute with it's bitter sweetness is hard not to love. The mojito is a reliable favorite. The dark and stormy is stupendous. The bartenders are very skilled and it makes all the difference in the world. Service is always on point. Nice servers, who seem to remember us as we are there so often. I'm not sure if Chaz still waits tables at Kaya as I haven't seen him in quite sometime. He was the greatest, most knowledgable, friendliest server I've had in my life, and we'd always get excited when we knew he was waiting on us. If you happen to see him, consider yourself lucky. And please, tip him well.  The vibe at Kaya is casual, Caribbean and inviting. Always a decent crowd at the bar sampling those stunning cocktails and ample amounts of seating. The lights are low, the music is funky, and I'm probably in a booth resisting the urge to lick my plate.  Kaya is not only my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. It's my favorite restaurant ANYWHERE. An exceptional dining experience all around. I could never do it justice with words. You'll have to check it out for yourself!",

    "text": "I've got no complaints with Kaya. Sure, like any decent restaurant in Pittsburgh, they get busy during prime hours.   They have a rotating selection of great beers, some good standbys in bottles, and adept bartenders who can mix a great drink on or off their seasonally changing cocktail menu.  The food here runs the gamut of Caribbean and American fare. Some of my favorites are the flank steak salad, cuban sandwich, or green curry for lunch and the paella, fish tacos, or the burger for dinner [note: their burger is stacked and loaded, good luck on that first bite].   Outdoor seating on a sunny afternoon is great. Parking can be trouble, but that's the case anywhere in the Strip. It's worth the time you'll spend circling for a place or the $5 for parking on the warehouse side of Smallman.",

I've been here twice and and I have ordered those wings both times.  On neither of those occasions would I have called those wings jerk and on only one were the wings even good.  On that second visit, what I got were some unseasoned chicken wings fried hard as shit.  So the waitress brought us some sauce, I shudder to think what kind of jerk sauce it actually was.  I do recall having some soup that was ok, but seriously,  the classification of this place as Caribbean is a stretch.  And the lack of consistency is a problem that I've had with so many Pittsburgh spots that it doesn't seem fair to dock them for it, hence, three stars.",

    "text": "Impressive. Great food, service AND decor. Love this place.  We had butternut squash/pumpkin/apple soup, corn and lentil beignets, and the fish tacos. All were a hit. The soup is completely vegetarian (with a touch of cream) and had amazingly rich deep flavor and spice. The beignets were light, with a sauce we just had to finish. And the fish tacos were a classic, as others report, really nicely done. The soup was so good, we quizzed them on the preparation!  I found the interior attractive and interesting, with great African art pieces and sculptures, a beautiful wood wall and back room, comfortable seating and good lighting. Not too noisy at lunchtime, when they were about half full, and I like the industrial touches with the old brick building as the backdrop.  We tried a couple of their drinks, and the Hummingbird is a very good, unusual rye-based cocktail. The bar is innovative. And the caramel-cardamom ice cream was also really good, not too sweet.  Strongly recommended. They have a prix-fix fried chicken dinner on Thursday too. Absolutely nothing to criticize here, well-worth seeking out.",

Our bill came to around $150 (tip included) for appetizers, dinner and drinks for 4 (with leftovers to take home!).  Autumn was our server and she was just splendid! She made thoughtful recommendations for both food and drinks, which was wonderful for our indecisive group! We had the margarita and the ___ which was a refreshing cucumber drink. Both were delicious!  We started with the Bean Dip and the Shrimp/Avacado Bruschetta. The dip was great, served with crispy and seasoned house-made chips. Warning: The Bruschetta was delicious but VERY HOT. I knew there would be a hint of habnaero, but our mouths were on FIRE!   Our server told us that each order comes with 3 tacos, but if we are splitting orders, they will give you 4 for no upcharge! That's a pretty amazing deal when the 3 tacos are already a very generous portion!  We heard the fish tacos were very popular, so we had to go with an order of those! I'm not normally a huge fan of fish tacos, but these were so enjoyable! It was topped with cabbage slaw and a spicy cream sauce. The fish was rich, but not overpowering.  My favorite part of the meal was the Tempura Avocado Bahn Mi Tacos! What a unique dish! The flavor was amazing and I can't wait to have them again! It was topped with carrot, radish,cilantro, yuzu mayo, & cucumber. Our server told us that they can add any type of protein to them, so we also had shrimp on them also. Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuum!  They serve their tacos on Reyna's tortillas, so I love the local aspect as well!  I was very impressed with the quality of the food and the service. I'll definitely be going back!",

It's a relatively small restaurant with a really big bar.  There's also outdoor seating, which is great for people watching in the strip.  The service was friendly and prompt without being intrusive.  The bathrooms are a little out of the way in the basement, but nevertheless nice and much nicer than I remember them years ago.  We started with a selection of appetizers.  The black bean dip with cheese was pretty good and is the same stuff you get at mad mex.  The scallopp app' was awesome, three huge scallops perfectly cooked with a nice sauce.  I got the \"pork belly\".  I've had this in other places and it was different than this.  This was basically a really fatty barbecued rib, but I like ribs,so I was happpy enough.  My entree' was the flank steak, which was a nice portion but a little undercooked and the black bean side was cold.  Overall an average entree'.  My friend ordered the shrimp with curry vegetables, which she liked a lot and had plenty of leftovers.  I tried the shrimp and they were cooked well and very fresh.  The curry veggies were super hot.  I was a bit disappointed in the wine list having asked for two of the wines on the menu only to find out that they were out of stock.  This is a good spot, but I wouldn't really consider it caribbean or west indian food.  I'm from the carribbean, so maybe I have too high standards.  I'd say this is to carribean food what olive garden is to italian food.",

    "text": "When visiting Pittsburgh earlier this month we were searching for a place to get a small, quick lunch on a sit-down restaurant.  Since we were \"sight-seeing\" Steeltown's \"Strip\" we decided to try Kaya.  The restaurant looked decent.  First, the service was inadequate fromt he first moment.  Our waitress was a bit rude, walked away in the middle of our order of drinks and then did not come back with even the ice water until 15 mins later.  We ordered a fried appetizer (a take on an Indian dish of which name I don't recall), and it was ok tasting....something a TGIF could pull off.  My husband ordered a seared tuna salad I believe and I got the jerk chicken salad.  His dish was on the bland side but edible.  My jerk chicken salad was a far cry from anything edible.  The chicken was so salty, had so much dry herbs and pepper that all I tasted was salted herbs and then fire from the pepper.  The dressing on the greens underneath the chicken was bitter and the mango salad that came on the side was not at all fresh.  I was starving so I managed to eat a third of it but then had to stop because it was beginning to really make me gag. I obviously refused the spacey waitress' offer to get the rest of the meal wrapped up.  If you like boring food trying to pass for something exotic then this is your place.  One other thing I can say is that the problem with service was not only a problem for us.  A couple sitting near us got up and left after not even getting menus for the first 15 or 20 mins and another family had to actually get up from the table to go get the waitress on the other side of the restaurant.  This was not a busy Sat so I doubt that lapses in service like this can be blamed on a busy hour.  In general our food experience in Pittsburgh was just bad.  I do hope that the city has more to offer than what we had the displeasure of trying.",

I tasted a lot of the drinks/food but I'll try to keep it to a minimum.  The service, first off, was awesome. Our waitress was awesome. Maybe it was because it was a slow night, but she voluntarily split our checks (never seen that happen with a party so large). +10 stars right there.  Our first round of drinks took a decently long time to come, but making 9 drinks takes time, so I understand. I got a Mojito. I think it was one of the first made, cause it tasted watered down. Some people got Dark & Stormys which were quite good. I don't know what type of ginger beer they use, but it was ridiculously ginger-y (a good thing). I also had a Troegs Nectar Nut Ale which was quite strong but a good dinner beer.  Now for the food. I should've listened to everyone and just ordered the fish tacos. Let me tell you now. If you visit Kaya for the first time, order the fish tacos; they are incredible. I, unfortunately, ordered the pork belly tacos. I'm a fan of pork and pork fat, but these were unbelievably fatty. It had to have been 70% fat and 30% meat. Some bites were pure fat, and it wasn't crispy bacon fat. It was gooey, gross (for me) fat. Luckily, someone couldn't finish all their fish tacos, so I traded for one of those (again, get the fish tacos). My GF got the veggie green curry which was surprisingly good. With the added shrimp, it would be an excellent meal for me (meat-a-tarian here). Three of us split the Mussels for an appetizer. I've only had mussels at Point Bruges, but I liked the Point Bruges mussels much more. The sauce at Kaya was great, but the texture of the mussels was not as good.  No one ate dessert. I would've given it 5 stars have I ordered the fish tacos, but the pork belly tacos were very disappointing.",
