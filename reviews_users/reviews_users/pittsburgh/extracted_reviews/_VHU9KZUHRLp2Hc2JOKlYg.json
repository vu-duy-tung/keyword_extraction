    "text": "I have to agree wholeheartedly with the observation of another reviewer: Cioppino is a good restaurant, just not good ENOUGH. Good enough for what? Mostly, for what they charge. I'm no stranger to expensive dining, but I know the difference between fancy and \"fancy,\" and while I had a good meal at Cioppino, the food wasn't fabulous. The menu, like nearby Eleven, served local ingredients and dishes of all proteins. $34 lamb, though, had better be knock-your-socks-off, holy-shit good. (Since they use many of the same local farms, like Elysian for the lamb, as Big Burrito, the comparison seems apt.) We found our dishes to be decently cooked, though we were both disappointed by what felt like a lack of innovation and, on my salmon, a hefty dousing of salt.  I'd definitely say that Cioppino is AOK--I agree that it's a great date restaurant, and the service was fantastic. However, this probably won't become a regular spot.",

The bar area was nice and not too noisy or crowded. The window table we sat at was nice, but a bit cold (we were there mid November); you might want to stay away from the window if you do not have a good tolerance for cold.  The cioppino was very good, but not the best I have had. We also had the potato crusted salmon, which was delicious. The wine was also very good. They had a huge wine list to choose from.   The service was OK. We would have preferred a different server who seemed to be more attentive.",

    "text": "Cioppino is conveniently located on Railroad St. right across from the Cork Factory.  The services offered at Cioppino are tremendous. You can park yourself in a nearby parking lot, parking garage, or have the valet park your car. Then when you step inside, the hostess greets you nicely; if they don't have your table ready (they almost always do if you have a reservation), they'll politely ask you to sit in their waiting area. At the table, every server I've had was polite, explained the specials in detail, and all the little things that you expect of them.  You have two seating options at Cioppino. The bar and the dining room. The bar is great if you want to watch a sports game or are alone. The dining room is great if you are looking for a formal dining experience. Each section has its own menu. I prefer the bar because you can order from either menu.  The chefs at Cioppino offer a wide variety of food. I usually get a steak there (just because I LOVE steak), but the seafood there is terrific as well. Try the branzino if you want a twist. The desserts are like no other. The gelato is amazing and try the beignets if you have a sweet tooth.  Personally, I like the way they publicize the restaurant. They have their own iPhone app where you can find dining room, bar, dessert, and wine menus as well as directions from your current location. They also have a website where they expand on that.  Overall, I think Cioppino is one of the top restaurants in Pittsburgh and if you haven't tried it, it would be a wise choice for a date or dinner meeting or whatever you want.",

Snagged a table in the bar and ordered a \"baby\" CdP (Plan Pegau) after a nice chat with the roving wine manager. Ordered up the lamb sliders and the Mac & cheese fritters... The Elysian Field lamb was perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection...juicy and delicious. The Mac and Cheese fritters where about as one would expect...lightly breaded balls of cheesy goodness, fried and served with a warm cheese sauce. The place was hopping with a fairly young crowd enjoying the music. Will have to venture back to try dining in the main room...menu looked good.",

When we got the bill it was the full menu price and we were told that the menu already reflected the 1/2 off price. I thought this was a very strange way to do your pricing and this should have been mentioned up front. Then my friend ordered a glass of sangria that when tasted was just pink colored lime juice. We told the bartender we were unhappy and she took the full glass away but kept it on the bill. So we paid for a glass of sangria that we were not even given the option to drink (even though it really was terrible). The food was great and very tasty, but the service from the bartender was awful to the point that you felt bad asking her for anything. And the looks you got when you did ensured that I will never let her wait on me again. I am not sure if we will be back to this establishment even though my friend lives across the street. I agree with another review that I felt the bartender was trying to inflate the bar tab rather than give good service.",

Overall, the atmosphere was fun, with a jazz band spicing up the front bar area and some solid cocktail choices to be had. The main dining area is in the rear of the establishment and has widely spaced tables and a private back room. The service was somewhat spotty but friendly, but did seem to improve as the night went on. As for the food, the bread basket and garlicky dipping oil were quite tasty, preparing us for our app choices. We had the Tuna Tartare (good but slightly bland), Beef Carpaccio (well presented and solid), and Lamb Sausage with Greens 'n' Beans (excellent). Being cliche', each couple split the Cioppino entree. It was nicely seasoned with fennel and garlic and had appropriate portions of seafood and fish. Overall, we had a fine evening and would recommend this location for both it's bar/music scene as well as the restaurant.",

I always get the signature dish, cioppino, and it's wonderful each time.   I like the half price wine by the bottle menu on Monday and the overall selection on the full wine list.   My husband really likes the caesar salad.  My only complaint is that they no longer have the beignets.   They were the perfect ending to dinner.  I hope they bring them back.  We did, however, have the chocolate fondue dessert and it was great.  I think this is the only restaurant where we order dessert.   It's probably a combination of the desserts being very yummy and the atmosphere.   It makes you want to linger and order dessert.  It's a first class restaurant that has great customer service.  They do a great job!  Thanks!",

    "text": "First of all, I will lay out the disclaimer that my review may be slightly biased because two of my good friends that I used to work with in restaurants, are the current GM and AGM there.  Therefore, we have never had a bad experience there because we always receive wonderful service and treatment (hey!  it's awesome to know people!  LoL). With that being said - Jordan and I still come here, not just to see our friends, but to indulge in great wine and great food for a great price.  This place is for ANYONE.  Truly.  You can walk in there with a Penguins' jersey on and watch a game in the Lounge/Bar or Cigar lounge, or you can walk in there for a nice romantic dinner for 2 and eat in the dining room.   Plus, the menu has a little bit for everyone as well.  We have been there and done the whole sh-bang:  Drinks, Apps, Entrees, & Dessert, and we have also gone for Wine & Apps.  Whatever you go for, your server or bartender caters to your needs.   The most recent time we went was because we couldn't get a table at Kaya.  I was unaware that Kaya took reservations as it wasn't mentioned in many Yelp reviews, nor are they members of \"Open Table\", which is where I specifically make reservations for restaurant.  Disappointed at the time, we then decided to go to Cioppino's because we knew we wouldn't be disappointed there! We went for Wine and Apps and sat in the Bar/Lounge.  They had a very enjoyable live jazz band playing that evening which also set the mood on a late Friday night.  We started with Caesar salads, that come with a piece of bruschetta.  Then we ended up ordering the Margherita pizza, until my friend, the AGM came over and also recommended the Risotto Fritters and Calamari.  Well, we were very glad that he did because we had quite a spread in front of us!  The margherita pizza was AMAZING!  Not too much cheese, bursting with basil flavor, and no over-load on the tomato sauce.  The Risotto fritters were fun to eat as well.  It was like eating a much more dignified Hush Puppy - that actually tasted like something, rather than just fried texture.  And the Calamari - YUM!  I love Calamari, especially when there are lots of testacles (or \"tentacles\" for those who don't get my humor) on the plate.  Plus the Calamari came with this lemon mayo that was a unique and different complement, than what I'm normally used to (a tomato-based or red-pepper based dipping sauce).   All in all, we love Cioppino's.  It has really great Italian/Pittsburgh food.  If you like the Olive Garden, then go there -  because your palette is probably not dignified enough to enjoy a place like Cioppino's.  But if you like really fresh, home-made tasting comfort Italian food, that appears on your plate to be prettier than anything you can come up with at home, then Cioppino's is your place.",

I rarely order tartar anywhere but at restaurants where I can trust that the tuna is fresh and high grade and that usually means higher class places. That being said, I've had better. It was just nothing spectacular.   Bacon goat cheese frisee salad: this was spectacular. Bacon and goat cheese perfectly balanced the bitterness of the frisee. I would order that again in a second.   Cioppino: this was decent. The mussels and clams were all very tender. The fish was cooked and seasoned nicely. The broth was so so. I had actually hoped for a bit of spice in it but got none. Overall it was fine. Not a dish I would name my restaurant after but good.   Staff: our waitress was delightful. The manager was also around and bought me a cigar for my birthday, which was a nice gesture.   Space: the dining area and cigar lounge are both fantastic. Roomy and not too dimly lit but enough to set the right kind of mood.  Overall a very good experience.",

The main event (dessert is always my main event) was a hot-chocolate fondue in a molten cake with an array of sweet treats, namely homemade marshmallows. Whew, we were stuffed beyond capacity.

Regarding the food: As appetizers, the risotto fritters and beef Carpaccio were both we very well prepared, although we'd probably leave off the peppers on the Carpaccio. The lamb chops were the size of a fist and with three to the dish it was a plentiful amount for any eater. The filet mignon was perfectly cooked and was served along side a wonderfully crafted pappardelle pasta with sweet sausage. We had an 'off menu' sample of the spicy charred tuna, which was absolutely out of this world. Some of the best tuna I've had in the city. There was absolutely no room for dessert, although we wished there was - the dessert menu looked very enticing.  Regarding the service: Bryce, our waiter was very knowledgeable, in both the wine and the food as well as prompt and courteous in all facets of his work. He had close to a sommelier's knowledge relating to wine; he steered us away from things based upon our conversation that he thought we wouldn't like, and brought us to an absolutely fantastic dinner and drink. In a bit of an old-school move, the chef stopped out to meet with the patrons to check in on the quality of the food - a nice touch anywhere.    Wonderful food, extensive wine list, tremond atmosphere and great service. Definitely a recommended spot in Pittsburgh.I'll be back there soon.",

    "text": "Last Friday I had the pleasure of dining at Cioppino and what an outstanding experience it was!  We had reservations for 7pm and we arrive and the bar has a decent crowd with some nice live music going on.  We are led to the restaurant portion of the restaurant and the noise level was perfect! You could hear the music but it wasn't so loud you couldn't hear your table speaking.  This is really a top-notch restaurant and you can tell because the waiters are professional and on top of their game. Our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable and helpful without being fussy. Score!    Cioppino's had some specials that night and my uncle and I decided to go all out and try the Live Sea Scallop.  The scallop is alive on the premises but when ordered they present it to you with the scallop sliced and with orange segments in between and then a wonderful citrus vinaigrette with basil and rock salt scattered on top of the scallop which is on the cleaned shell. This was one of the best appetizers I've had in my life. So light, refreshing, crisp and just simple and so tasty.  For dinner the debate of another special and the crabcakes became my dilemma. I asked our wonderful waiter for his opinion and he suggested the crabcakes since I was an out of town visitor.  Great choice!  The crabcakes are also light, with little filling. Basically enough to keep the crab together and then coated in breadcrumbs and lightly fried. Wow! What an experience! The mac and cheese was really rich, cheesy and delicious. I'm not sure which cheese was the star, but it was damn good.  What could top of this perfect meal? Dessert!  My uncle, aunt and I decided to split the Trio of Creme Brulee.  Three different flavors, three of us. Perfect! They were creamy and delicious and oh so tasty and thoughtfully presented. Each flavor had its own garnish. Nice!  We ordered coffee and it was superb coffee.  Well played.  Breakdown The food: 5 star! The experience: 5 star! The value: Well... can you put a price on a 5 star experience? Yeah, it's pricey, but if you think you deserve it, then go! Would I return?: I'd love to! 5 stars?: 5 Star!",

We got the oysters and yellowtail for appetizers, both extremely fresh, tender and succulent.  We both got the NY strip and Scallops for our entrees, almost like a surf and turf dinner, but it was a special order that was not on the menu.  The wait staff and chef were more than happy to oblige, and served the best cooked strip I've ever tasted - it was juicy, tender and extremely flavorful.  The scallops were perfectly grilled and colossal in size.  Finally, we got the sampler dessert, that featured a wonderful custard, banana French toast-like dessert and the best of them all - chocolate covered bacon!    The waiter was extremely friendly and willing to accommodate our requests, and even took dessert off our final bill because it was our anniversary - completely unexpected and much appreciated!  We paired dinner with a bottle (or two!) of the Oberon Cab, it was wonderful with the Strip.  We cannot wait to go back!!",

The whiskey choices are good as well and tasted fresh.  The only down fall was the service. It was adequate but not extremely fast. I will certainly visit again.",

    "text": "What an incredibly beautiful restaurant!  Tonight we celebrated the birth of my angel here, his choice.  We were seated promptly for our 6 pm reservation.  Ron, our server was incredible.  Beverage choices were very good, BJ got a Samuel Adams Alpine Spring seasonal beer.  We had attended a business function here last fall and I was served a specialty beverage called a coconut macaroon, not currently on the menu.  Ron was kind enough to consult the bartender to see if they could recreate my drink, which they did.  It was just as amazing as I remember.  For our starters, BJ got the mussels and clams which he really enjoyed.  The portion was a nice size and he really liked the broth, which was garlic and white wine.  I opted for the beet salad.  I thought it was very good, I really liked the blue cheese and the red wine vinaigrette.  For our meals, BJ got the filet with lobster and the Gruyere & onion bread pudding.  His steak was served with a trio of steak sauces and grilled to perfection.  However, he thought the lobster claw meat was bit overcooked.  Also, we love fingerling potatoes but were not a fan of these.  They were a little hard and the bread pudding was a little dry.  I got the crab cakes with mac & cheese.  The crab cakes were not the Maryland style jumbo lump crab meat that I am used to.  I thought they were just okay.  Since it was the big guy's big day, we ordered a blood orange cake for dessert.  They were thoughtful enough to write Happy Birthday in chocolate sauce.    All in all, we had a mixed opinion of our experience.  The interior of the restaurant is very nice and our server Ron was amazing and provided incredible service the entire evening.  We thought that the food, while good, didn't quite measure up.  In spite of this, we will probably be back to visit, again.",

While the service was very friendly and accommodating, the food left a lot to be desired. We started out with three appetizers: antipasti platter, tuna tartare, radicchio salad and oysters on the half shell. These were all very good with fresh ingredients, but they didn't require much preparation.   When our entrees came out, they lacked any kind of pizzazz. Each plate looked like something I threw together in my own kitchen. Presentation is not of huge importance, but uninspired plating started us out on the wrong foot, and the rest was all downhill. The crab steaks and strip steak were cooked well but lacked any flavor that you should expect from a moderately priced restaurant. Our side of Parmesan risotto was equal parts cream and boring.   As an aside, the place lacks a variety of side dishes. No potatoes or greens or vegetables besides Brussels sprouts?",

I had the basic hamburger -- well done.  Waitress prompt, helpful and efficient.  Food and drink came quickly and as ordered.  I tried the calamari appetizer but it was not \"crispy\" as I like it ... the waitress, without prompting, simply took it off the bill.  Nice gesture.  The band was excellent -- apparently a Friday night staple of Cioppino's -- all seasoned professionals.  Enjoyed the animation from the bassist -- Jim Spears; Agwanda has an interesting range in playing... and he is from the Chicago music world (which I am familiar with....).  Drummer is low key, soft, and creates a jazzy pocket. They work in both a trio and with a keyboardist (plus others who drop by).    The band started about 7:15.   The bar space started loading up with customers about 7:45.  We left at 9:15 and it appeared as though the crowd/music was going to take off nicely.  Sigh.  Valet parking, again, fast and courteous, free after 5 pm.  As this section of the city moves forward with more condo's, hotels and motels... Cioppino's will be a good draw for people, tourists and those who live nearby.  f8 and be there  ((Cioppino's -- one comment about the band space -- they really need to add a few bars of light cans -- in the afternoon, the sun simply overrides everything in the room, and when the sun goes down, the band is in the dark -- the visual of an active band, after dark, properly light, will draw folk as people pass by because of the openness of the bar to the street visually --  for 3-400 dollars Cioppino's can transform their bar/band space and it will draw)).",

The oysters and $5 prosecco get the two stars. My friend got an old glass of wine that smelled and tasted funny and had to send it back. The French fries were very soggy and greasy. The chicken tacos were strange and I only ate part of one. I couldn't get he taste of onion out of my mouth for hours. There was no salsa or anything served with them. The manager came over and told us that they're known for the chicken tacos and everyone else likes them. Basically he was telling us that we were in the wrong for thinking they were not good. There are much better places around with good food and good specials. Will not be back unless it's only for oysters and prosecco.",

    "text": "The BF and I love coming to Cioppino for cocktails and cigars - their cigar bar is awesome all around and I could spend hours here!  On my most recent visit this past weekend, we were trying to pass some time between a wedding ceremony and reception in the Strip. The complimentary valet was especially appreciated on this rainy day!  Upon arriving, we grabbed two large, comfy chairs next to the bar and waited for the bartender to take our orders: an Acid Blondie and glass of Sauvignon Blanc for me, and a Kuba Kuba cigar for Lee.  They present the cigars to you on a metal tray, complete with a cutter and butane lighter.  The bartender asked if we would be ordering any food, and since our stomachs were grumbling at the thought of having to wait through the typical wedding reception festivities before we were served dinner, we decided to nosh on half a dozen oysters.  They arrived quickly, perfectly chilled and served with two yummy sauces.  One of them was more of a mayonnaise-type sauce, and the other was more of an oil that had a serious but welcome kick to it.  6 oysters disappeared in about 60 seconds and I was starting to wish we had ordered more! They were delicious!  I keep batting around the idea of coming here for an actual dinner, perhaps on a Tuesday when they have dollar oysters!  I will say though, that when we received our check I was pleasantly surprised:  the 6 oysters only ran us $12 -- $2 a pop!  The flavor and quality for that price completely blew my mind.  I will absolutely be back again for more and am hoping that they continue to impress... I'll be sure to update with a 5 star review when they do!  One last tip:  if you are visiting the cigar bar, the high top tables just inside the entrance (along the windows) are some of my least favorite.  The way the venitaliton system is set up and depending on which seat you are sitting in, the smoke will keep blowing right in your companion's face.  Just a little tip that we now use to determine where we will (or won't) sit when we go here :)",

And in additional to our $15 portion of the wine we didn't bring she also charged us $3.75 for another quarter of an uncorking fee. I did have one glass of wine out of their bottle but $18.75 for one glass of wine seemed outrageous to us. We both ordered dinners, my boyfriend had 3 drinks and I ordered desert. I find this HUGE up change for the wine to be unfair.  The dessert was awesome the martinis were great. The scallops were very good but small. The linguini with seafood was disappointing. I would never pay $30 to uncork what I am assuming was a $10 bottle of wine.",

We were seated in the bar area, not what I was expecting but ok. We order an appetizer and it was delivered to the wrong table. The waiter then tried to take it off the wrong table and put it on ours. We asked for a new appetizer. He apologized and said that they had to rent tables for the weekend. Our dinners were amazing however. I had the short ribs and my partner had the mahi mahi. Great portion sizes and the flavors were amazing. After we were almost done with dinner they brought us bread with another apology that they forgot. So I had to pay the same amount as someone lucky enough to sit in the actual dining room and got second rate service. I got a glance at the dining room and that is what I thought I was reserving a table for.   After dinner we headed to the cigar bar. Great selection of whiskey. My partner is a cigar aficionado and a bourbon connoisseur so he really enjoyed the cigar bar.   Will we go back, no to the restaurant and possibly for the cigar bar.",

I got the chef special halibut and my husband got the cioppino. We also started with the live scallop appetizer. The food was fresh. The halibut was really tender, but not really flavorful and the creamy white sauce was way too buttery in taste to me. The mussel in the cioppino I tried was sandy, which I'm not a big fan of.

Terrific service really matters and can really make or break an experience and Brielle really delivered superior 5 star service from the time we walked in the door. I might have been inclined to rate the food a bit higher had I not just eaten at Top Chef Master Takashi's restaurant in Chicago literally the Saturday before. Dinner at Cioppino wasn't quite the same but Brielle's service provided just as much fun and she deserves kudos for that! Our calamari appetizer was tender and flavorful and is definitely something I'd order again although the romaine salad from the specials menu arrived pre-dressed and was a little heavy for my liking. I ordered the crab cakes and mac & cheese for my entree thinking I could do no wrong there. Unfortunately, the mac & cheese was almost dry and not chef worthy. The sauce under the crab cakes was very heavy and fatty tasting which didn't enhance the dish. The crab cakes themselves were very tasty with minimal filler and worthy of 4.5 stars. My husband ordered the Alaskan Halibut and he seemed pretty happy with his choice although he also couldn't help comparing our dinner here to Takashi either. The best part of our evening was topped off by Brielle yet again by providing a special anniversary dessert of their banana French toast with chocolate bacon on the side -very fun & innovative! The cigar bar attached to the restaurant is a nice area to stop off for an after dinner drink and a cigar served on a silver platter is a fun touch.",

I read many great reviews about Cioppino and it did not disappoint. To start we shared the scallop crudo with chive and blood orange (the hands down favorite), beef carpaccio, antipasti platter,1/2 dozen oysters, and fried calamari. All were fresh and the accoutrements for each dish were well paired. Before our entrees arrived my dad and I were perusing the wine list when the sommelier arrived and offered suggestions that perfectly complemented our respective entrees. For our entrees my mom and I shared the scallops on lobster risotto, my dad have the tuna, and my fiance had the duck. All dishes were quickly devoured. We all ordered a different dessert from the menu: Key lime pie, linzer cheesecake, creme brulee, and chocolate molasses cake. When the desserts arrived they also brought the chef's sampler selection, and comped both my and my fiance's  dessert.   While all the food was outstanding, I was really blown away by the service. The hostess calling day of the confirm the reservation, and then apologizing for the two minutes we stood at the host stand while she sat a table. Our waitress (i forget her name) was very attentive, constantly refilling water, replacing silverware, and bringing additional plates and drinks. The sommelier seeing us looking at the wine menu popped over and offered excellent recommendations. The manager checking our table as we enjoyed dinner. We were even lucky enough to have both the chef and pastry chef stop by to say hello and congratulations. Very high end dining experience. I am so excited that I chose Cioppino to celebrate this special night with my parents and fiance.   Did I mention they also offer complimentary valet service!",

    "text": "I generally trust Yelp reviewers but I just don't get this. I was really excited to try Cioppino and my boyfriend and I  took his mother there while she was in town. While some of my complaints might seem nitpicky when you're paying $40-$50 for an entree everything should be perfect.  So I'll walk you through it:  - Lobster risotto....ok but nothing out of the ordinary. - Goat and green salad....a pile of greens with mashed up goat cheese and a pile of overcooked bacon. No presentation whatsoever.  - We waited over a half hour for our entrees when the first two courses came out so fast that they never cleared our plates, or had a chance to bring us new ones. They constantly mixed up sparkling and still water and never brought new glasses to fix the mess up. - When the entrees finally showed up I was completely underwhelmed. The filet was cooked nicely but the sides were a cold and bland mess of spinach and boiled potatoes with heavy cream mixed in as an afterthought. The lamb was ok but the lentils were undercooked. The ribeye was THIN a $50 cut of meet looked kind of like it cam from sizzler. A ribeye at any other reputable steakhouse is thick and intimidating, and again this was paired with bland boiled red potatoes. The lamb was ok but the lentils were undercooked.   This place was packed and the bar scene seemed ok (albeit older), but the food was uninspired and bland. If you're going to spend this kind of money head to Spoon, Salt or Eleven where the food is creative and they understand the importance of a dining experience.   I will say they did try to make things right by comping the wine, however that doesn't fix the issues they have with their menu. When you're a seafood and chophouse and the most memorable part of your restaurant is the dipping oil for the bread you have a problem.",

For work and social occasions I'm always looking for something different - and this one never made the radar.    6 of us went last night, planning just to have appetizers in the bar/lounge area.  When we arrived - there was a private party...but they were able to accommodate us at a table in the dinning room.  We were a little surprised that we sat down at 6pm on a friday night - to a relatively empty dining room.  (Hope business from the groupon is kicking in soon!)  The service from the host and our waiter was top notch.  Very accommodating.  For appetizers we had the Lamb Sliders and Risotto fritters.  Others have raved about the Lamb sliders - and it's well justified.  I'm not a huge fan of lamb, but these were great.  Incredibly tender and flavorful...enough to make consider adding lamb to my own cooking rotation. Topped with crumbled blue cheese - they were a perfect appetizer.  The risotto fritters were also very good...but I have little memory of them when comparing them to the Lamb minis.  For my entree I had scallops with lobster risotto.  I additionally ordered a side of grilled asparagus.  The scallops were perfectly cooked.  Seared on the outside, very tender on the inside.  Risotto was good.  Not the best I've had (Casbah made me cry last week it was so good)...but definitely a solid showing and would order again.  I like when Risotto is served as a compliment - not the entire course...so this was a good fit with the scallops. Lobster meat was very tender.  Asparagus was probably the only weak showing.  I expected thicker hearty asparagus - especially if it was grilled.  It was thiner/smaller...kind of a weak batch.  But it was well-prepared...so points for that.  Two others at the table got the gnocchi...not something I'd typically order myself, but was happy to steal.  These were unlike any gnocchi I've ever had.  Seriously these were giant pillows of fluffy deliciousness.  I was happy to steal several bites.  I'm not sure I'd order myself next time, but I will make sure someone at my table orders it so I can continue to steal.  We didn't get dessert - which I immediately regretted... but I'm sure I'll be back again soon.",

    "text": "It was a birthday and we went with friends for a quiet evening over good food and some wine. The wine was excellent and the food was good. The risotto had great texture and lumps of tasty lobster. The cioppino seafood dish was varied and nicely presented: not nearly as generous as the one in Europe my friends told me. The service was attentive, maybe a little too much but we put that down to the newness of the server who was trying especially hard. But the entire evening was ruined for us by an extremely loud band in the adjacent lounge that overwhelmed the dining space. Our expectation of a quiet meal was totally blown away by the din that made all conversation impossible. An expensive waste of an evening. The owners need to think about what they are offering; music in the lounge is one thing, but overwhelming the restaurant is another.",

(LOVED our waiter! He was extremely knowledgeable and was as memorable as the entrees!)   We were very graciously comped drinks after being seated in the dining room, as our table was not ready for close to 1/2 hour past our reservation time. (we did not complain about the wait)  My meal: Pork Belly and green salad-- Actually an appetizer, but was served the same time as the others' salads. Delicious, crispy and salty on top, rich and luxurious below. Specials menu  Handmade (hand-cut) linguine with chanterelle mushrooms and truffle oil. As soon as it was placed in front of me, a sort of tunnel vision took over. Aromatic of course, loads of mushroom and perfectly cooked linguine. I loved the slight differences in thickness of the noodles. The server told me that shrimp may be added to this dish if desired (I did not). Specials Menu  Random Notes: my friend announced: best crab cakes. EVER.  according to me- best calamari EVER, perfect seasoning, crispy batter, squid still soft and served with instantly addictive julienned, battered, deep fried lemon peel.  A visit from super-chef Greg Alauzen was a pleasant surprise.  We went to the cigar bar after dinner for more drinks, smokes and got to see the end of the Penguins game. The two husbands enjoyed their ($15 each) cigars and my closet-smoking friend got to enjoy a few cigs without freezing to death. I tolerated it and went home and febreezed my sweaters!  Loved it!",

All were good, but none really stood out in our minds. Perhaps the best thing we had was the dessert sampler. Everything on the plate was delicious, except for the chocolate covered bacon.

The decor was having and identity crisis: think Italian cafe, German rustic, ice cream bar, and sports bar. We were one of two tables yet the food took horrendously long- almost an hour- to come, and it was poor quality. The \"bruschetta\" was stale bread with cold canned tomato on top. Really?! A friend's small pizza came out burned, and two folks left the mushroom gnocchi barely touched because it was pretty bland. The waiter also never came around to ask if we wanted another glass of beer or wine. Then when we went to pay, he didn't have enough cash for change. He seemed extremely flustered the whole time so maybe he was having a bad day, but everything combined made us all believe the restaurant is poor quality in general.",

    "text": "I will admit, I am a big fan of Cioppino.  The food, drinks, wine and service I have always found to be top notch.  On my past visit last night, we found the exact same thing.  The venue is quite big.  As you walk in there is a large bar area to the right with plenty of space at the bar and lots of tables spread around.  There is a little area in the corner for live entertainment.  On the left hand side is the dining area.  Ample space between tables allows you to talk with the people in your party without having to shout.    The menu has a nice variety, with the main focus being on seafood.  However, there are good options if you are interested in steak, lamb, pork chops or chicken.  There is a good amount of appetizers and small plate options to start off with as well.  We opted for the cheese plate and calamari.  Both were really good and was a good start.  For dinner, I went with the 14 ounce Pork Chop (cooked medium based on Chef's recommendation).  This was cooke to perfection, honestly, I have not had a pork chop that was that juicy and flavorful in a long time.  My wife had the lamb and she loved it.  I snuck a piece off her place and found it to be delicious.  Our friends went with the Cioppino and judging by the cleaned plates, I believe they really enjoyed it.  Though the food is fantastic, I find that I love the wine/whiskey/drink menu to be my favorite items to review and taste.  The wine menu is quite extensive and it comes on an iPad.  The menu is easy to peruse.  They offer a large variety of sparkling, white, red, rose and dessert wines across many counties, both New and Old World.  If you like scotch, bourbon, cognac, calvados, armagnac, grappa...etc, they have plenty of options for you as well.  You like cocktails?  Plenty of signature drinks to be had.  I went with a Szarerac and it was spot on.    Service was spectacular.  Ben, the sommelier and Jeremy our server were fantastic, helpful and very engaging.  Still a favorite spot for me, not sure why I do not make it down here more often, chalk it up to being stupid.  I will be back more frequently.",

The food here is very good. The menu features quite a bit of fish, but if you are a meat eater, there are steak, pork and chicken options as well.  The service is spot on.  The concierge desk attendant is always pleasant and helpful.  The servers are attentive, know the menu well, and are willing to offer suggestions should you need any.

    "text": "I have mixed feelings on Cioppino. On one hand, the space in all three parts (dining room, bar, and cigar room) is really nice and pretty welcoming. The crowd is a bit more dressy at times, but overall, the vibe is more relaxed that one would expect. I've also had some pretty delicious menu items in our handful of visits (the tomato-based crab bisque on our last visit being one of them), but I've also had plenty of average food, as well (the gnocchi, which was made in-house, but served with a bland mixture of ingredients and overwhelmed by the use of excessive broccoli rabe, for example).   They have a solid selection of wines and whisky, but the prices are a few dollars more than most places ($14 for a Balvenie Doublewood, for example, that's typically $11-12/pour), and as I mentioned in a tip left here: Watch out when you order a whisky. If you order a scotch, expect a double automatically. Also, expect to pay for that unwarranted double when your bill arrives. Did you order your whisky \"neat?\" Expect a $2 upcharge. None of this will be explained to you when ordering, so just be prepared to pay 133% of what's listed on the menu, plus $2 if ordered neat. Very strange approach, if you ask me, and I can't imagine many patrons being as forgiving as us.  We've typically sat in the bar area, which was okay. The music can be a bit loud for casual conversation on Fridays. The jazz band is a decent trio/quartet...but not great. We've also done the cigar room experience, as well as the dining room experience. Both got the job done, but neither left us with any overly-positive impressions.  So, you can see a theme here. Cioppino is a place that tries to do a lot of things right, and certainly has the potential, but ultimately slips in nearly every area. For the price, there's no excuse for falling short. Entree prices are high enough that a better experience can be had at numerous restaurants within a mile or so of Cioppino, if you're looking in the $25-45 range. Want to experience overpriced whisky? There are places with better selections and experiences close by. I feel less guilty paying $36 for a single ounce of harder-to-find bourbon at, say, Butcher and the Rye, than $23 for a double (that I didn't ask for) of run-of-the-mill scotch at Cioppino.   We have no plans on returning, but the fact that we kept giving the place a chance should say that we recognize the potential (not to mention our desire to have another good place near home), but we've left underwhelmed too many times. If they worked harder at improving the experience (and making sure their staff acts with some professionalism near the bar when they don't think anyone is looking) instead of finding ways to inflate the check, we'd be able to recommend the place. As it is, save your money and time and explore some of the other excellent establishments Pittsburgh has at the moment.",

We ended up with a 5:30 reservation on the bar side of the restaurant and really enjoyed ourselves. They both ate off of the restaurant week menu ($55 for 3 courses and wine pairings) and were really impressed. My mom's filet was perfectly cooked and incredibly tender and their wine pairings were spot on. I had the potato gnocchi with pork cheek confit and the green beans with chili paste and both were fantastic. The Smores cronut with graham cracker ice cream was one of the best desserts I've had in months. The one item lacking was the beef tartare- the consistency was unappetizing and closer to ground beef than the small dice that is desirable for the traditional preparation.

We started with the winter and goats n' greens salads (both were flavorful) and the beef tartare which was just MOUTH-WATERINGLY TASTY! My bf's mom ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and that is just about as good as it gets, my bf got the Chicken, and I got the Cioppino. The mussels, scallops, crab, and clams were fresh and the homemade sauce was delectable. Nabbed a wine bottle for the table as it was 1/2 off (Rosato, Italy 2012) and it was refreshing- not my favorite, but decent. The service (Ivor, our waiter) was on point, the food was amazing, and the company even better, so overall a 5-star experience here.   Also, the pesto sauce that comes with the bread is TO DIE FOR. Don't even bother with the butter.",

The only thing it's lacking is the dining room decor/ambiance doesn't make much sense. So it puts you off at first without realizing why.   ITS WORTH IT!!",

So well cooked my fork cut through then like they were melted butter! The lobster pieces were a little chewy but the flavor was there! I wasn't overly impressed with the risotto under the scallops as after a few bites, it just started to feel like paste.   My friends each got steak - one got the prime rib which was perfectly cooked and the other got the New York strip which was also perfectly cooked. The honey glazed carrots were rich and tender and the bartender was attentive to our needs the entire time we were there.   The cigar lounge next door is amazing! Very upscale but great ventilation as there was no smoke really hanging in the room. Good selection of cigars overall as well.  The only negative thing I have for this place is that on the first weekend over every month they have a local jazz combo in the bar area - they are so loud that you are having to tell over people just to talk to the person next to you. The venue is just to small for the band.",

They were a little heavy on the lemon flavor. The other Mrs. had a filet which wasnt bad- but not great.. I wanted tuna but was convinced the signature Cioppino was better.... my friend and I ordered that instead. It was good, but should have been an appetizer. We left hungry....  With all the advertising and hype I was let down...I wanted a cigar and stuck my head inside. Hmmm. I know the flack will be- \"What did you expect?!\"...I expected the aroma of cedar and cigar but not a room with a haze and clouds... ever hear of a smoke eater? Not a room someone who is not smoking will enjoy.   Nice try, if i want great food, ill go elsewhere. If I want a nice bar, I'll go elsewhere. If I want a cigar, i'll go elsewhere... if I want food, drink AND a cigar- ok, you got me....",

Maybe 2 years ago I kept going by but it was always closed. Well I finally hit it last year with an old buddy, PHiL Q  while in town. Mind you this is for the Cigar bar - Loved it. There are so many cities that don't have something like this anywhere. And this is done well - great cocktails, good smokes, and we shared some apps.   I don't think anyone is walking in here thinking it's going to be cheap. It's not and it's also not that dive bar that patted me down for a gun! a few blocks away when I stopped in for a beer! I don't mind and come prepared to have some nice drinks and good conversation.   I hope Pittsburgh never loses this gem.",

For dinner I had the crab cakes with a side of bacon mac and cheese that came with it, it was not a side I purposely chose. I would not have put mac and cheese with crab cakes but would have preferred a veggie or a grain.

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that the best part of this place is the cigar bar. It's really really nice with a very warm atmosphere. You can bring your own cigars.   My cousin came into town and I wanted a place to meet to have a cigar followed by dinner. So I suggested this place and we met and had a cigar and cocktails. I had it in my head that we would leave after that and go to gauchos for dinner because I have eaten here before and was less than impressed. However my cousin said he had looked at the menu online and it looked good and was in the mood for steak. He also said he didn't feel like driving to go anywhere else.   So against my better judgment I acquiesced and we got a table in the dining room. It was a Thursday night in the dining room was virtually empty at 8 o'clock. That should've been a tip off.  For an appetizer we shared the calamari which was very good but they had some mayonnaise-based lemony dipping sauce and not the traditional marinara sauce on the side. The dipping sauce did nothing for the appetizer.  The presentation in both our meals was Unimpressive.  My cousin selected the steak and to be honest it look like it was cooked perfectly. He said he enjoyed it But I don't know if he was just being polite.  I selected the cioppino which should've been a signature dish. When it arrived there were half a dozen over cooked muscles a couple of clams and 2 x 3\" piece of what I suspect was Tapiatila in an unflavorful broth. There was one large shrimp that was pretty good. But if this was the signature dish for the restaurant they failed miserably. Half The plate was taken up by pieces of toasted Italian bread. I didn't even want to dip in the broth. When I left I was still hungry and considered stopping at McDonald's but passed on that and headed home. Fortunately my wife had gone out and gotten some chicken wings and brought home the leftovers which I hungrily devoured.   Where it not for the cigar bar I would give this place one star.   I will say that the bar portion of the restaurant was pretty well attended and they had live music which we could hear in the dining room and wasn't overly loud.   So bottom line is if you want to go here for a cocktail or cigar it's pretty good but if you want to eat here forget it find someplace else !  There were too many good restaurants in the strip and this place failed miserably to meet the mark, especially for the prices that they were charging. I would not recommend it.",

I had the Pork chop which, to say the least, was the equivalent of pure heaven melting in my mouth. While the beans were slightly cold, the Mac and cheese side addition more than made up for that.   Dessert was presented wonderfully, and the kitchen was kind enough to place the name of my friend who's birthday we were celebrating on the plate, something which is rarely done but made him feel very welcome even at the very end of the meal!  Overall, a wonderful dining experience with excellent selections and service that cannot be beat! Definitely give it a try!",

    "text": "We got to Cioppino early on a Monday, there was almost no one there, so why our waitress was unseen for about 5 minutes I have no idea... We order drinks, and discuss the menu. It was restaurant week, so the SO decides to get that (salmon carpaccio, steak, cronut). I get the calamari and tuna. And we wait, and wait, and wait... FINALLY she comes back, annnnd brings our drinks. And we wait, and wait, and wait... She comes back, we order. 6 minutes later, we are wondering if we will get bread, since everyone else seems to have gotten bread when our apps arrive. Maybe we didn't order something that allows bread, whatever....  Calamari is.. disappointing, wayyyyy to greasy. Sitting in a pool of oil greasy Salmon is really salty, but way better than the calamari  Then we wait.....   Dinner comes at almost the exact same time as the bread we were wondering about earlier... I'm not sure what my SO thought of the steak, but he ate less than half of it. The tuna was not good. It was cooked rare, which I was warned about, but it was more like cooked all on one side medium and then just dropped on the other side for 2 seconds. On top of the inconsistent done-ness, it wasn't a great piece of fish.  Cronut was good.... but not good enough to make up for everything else. They said that the icecream had whiskey in it, but it tasted like plain vanilla to me.  Ohh I forgot to mention that the SO did the wine pairing. Wine was good, but the app pairing arrived 5 minutes before the app, dinner pairing arrived after we were more than half way done with dinner and he had to ask for it, and the dessert pairing arrived at the same time as our check, well after we were done eating the dessert.  What a mess.  Don't think I would waste $140 on the crappy service or crappy food again.",

For appetizers we got the oysters, beef tartare, and calamari. All were excellent. Favorite was the calamari.   For the main meal I had the duck. It was perfect. Medium-rare. My brother had the new ribs off their smoker. Very good bark and taste. The scallops my sister had were cooked perfectly as well and were melt in your mouth.   The dessert was also amazing. I had a great time and want to come back to try more. My only negative might have been it took awhile but all in all great experience and evening.",

    "text": "As a classy, elegant establishment, it was a perfect place to take my boyfriend for a date night, especially after all the fabulous reviews. There are plenty of meat and seafood entrees to satisfy his carnivorous appetite, and the restaurant offers alternative dishes off menu to accommodate vegetarians like myself. My boyfriend ordered the lamb while I decided to allow the chef to go rogue and whip me up surprise. The lamb came out slightly overcooked and was sent back. It took a while for the new dish to be prepared, but when it was, it was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. Crispy on the outside, nice and juicy on the inside. He was very impressed (and that doesn't happen often!). My dish, however, was not as impressive. It was a vegetable medley that was greasy and over salted. Not your best work, chef. For dessert, we were offered a special ice cream cupcake which was DELICIOUS! It was a vanilla cake topped with a thick layer of birthday cake ice cream. So incredible. One of the best desserts I've had and trust me, I've had many.  One of my main concerns going into dinner was that the restaurant would reek of cigar smoke, but their ventilation system does a great job of removing the smell from the restaurant. Honestly, I would not have even known it was a cigar bar.   Our waitress was very charming and took great care of us throughout our dinner. We had several questions about the menu, and she was so helpful and patient. As the restaurant got busier, she became less attentive but it was understandable.   The parking was very convenient. I parked in the Cork Factory garage which was validated; however, complimentary valet is provided as well.",

The dining area and bar area are separated by the main entrance with dim romantic lighting in both areas. The service is fantastic and the food is amazing, my fiance got the Filet and it was good to perfection and I got the salmon which was also amazing. The portions were just right and we were not overly full. After dinner we made our way over to the bar to relax and have a drink while they have a very good live band playing. After that we went into the cigar bar area that is behind the bar in an enclosed area with very good ventilation as you could not see any smoke when you went in other than that coming from the ends of cigars, cigarettes, or pipes. They have there own bar in there with high tops, low tops, and a couple couches making it the \"ultimate man cave\". You can purchase from a variety of cigars they have stocked or bring your own at no extra charge.   On a side note: They do have valet service as parking is very tight around the area there.  I definitely recommend going here at least once.",

I was surprised with Zuchinni blossoms also a birthday surprise treat and even a personalized \"Happy Birthday Kristen\" on both of our menus.  The food was phenomenal I had the sea scallops with lobster risotto and my husband the strip steak both portions were generous and perfectly cooked and presented.  Tom was our server and his service was top notch, he knows his stuff and was attentive with our timing since we had a show to attend that evening.  I highly recommend this restaurant and would return and recommend to friends and family.  My expectations are far exceeded and made for an amazing early birthday.  Thanks so much to Tom who made it enjoyable as well :)",

Driving to the location (well in our case Uber) you kind of wonder where it is- then all of a sudden you're there.   They have some parking on the street and the option for valet. We were dropped off like some kids at the mall on a Friday night.   Upon entry the place is very upscale- dark wood, dim lights, a lot of attention to detail in every little thing. I would say it is an upscale restaurant so don't attempt to enter dressed like you rolled out of bed.   We were sat next to the window in the bar area- which wasn't a bad seat, however there were these really intimate style couches that I wish we could have tried.   We opted to order an appetizer of the carb dip which came with homemade saltines. Reminded me of the Cracker chips at the bottom of the bag that they threw on the plate. Dip was very good, garnished with some lemon juice - but the saltines may need upgraded at some point.   For the entree I fired on the cassoulet- which was first for me in trying something new. It is made with beans and as anyone who knows me knows- as long as they aren't pureed and refried I can deal. Different mouth feel- but this was very hearty and the sauce was incredible.   We passed on dessert- not really able to find anything that caught our attention.   I highly recommend it. Well done.",

Bone in Ribeye was delicious and dry aged,  lots of flavor and very tender and juicy.  Giving it a 9 out of 10.   Brussel sprouts and bacon were very good and I give those a 9 out of 10  Mac n cheese was good but past was a hair over cooked but still delicious I give it an 8 out of 10.   Cheesecake was small but had tons of flavor with a white chocolate shell and dark chocolate in the center surrounded by cheesecake. Give it a 9 out of 10.

Great selection of food on the bar menu which is all discounted for happy hour...a couple generous burgers, fried shark tacos, a Pittsburgh-style steak salad, and much more. Very decent house wines, beer and a few cocktails on happy hour too, and it runs till 7pm which is a bonus. Some great waitstaff including a few alumni from the late, great Six Penn Kitchen such as Kristen in the lounge and manager David.  Though I haven't had a sit-down dinner there in years, I would expect it is the same quality as the service and food in the bar/lounge.",

I had been seeing (and hearing) Mark Madden rave about the Super Genius Burger for a week and knew I had to try it.    We got in a little after 5:00 and had plenty of bar table seating to choose from.  The bar was full and lively so it felt comfortable.  We were greeted immediately by a friendly waiter who offered drinks.  We opted for our beer of choice- Coors Light.  They were delivered immediately with glasses of water for a chaser.  ;)  Our server asked if we were there for Burger Day and he pointed our the bar specials for us to review.  I ordered the Super Genius and my wife ordered the Pizza Burger.  We had seen them each posted on FaceBook looking mouth watering and wondered how ours would look.  The place started to fill up and we ordered our second beers.  I'm guessing the burgers took about 40 minutes to come out, which seemed odd because the actual restaurant was empty and I guess the chef waits for several orders to come in before he starts cooking.    My burger was exactly as pictured but the fries were a tad greasy- probably because the fryer wasn't hot enough.  But the burger made up for it.  It's made of 2- 8oz fresh prime beef patties, house cured bacon, blue cheese, sriracha ketchup, bacon jam, lettuce & tomato on a house made bun.  Way too big to fit in my, (or anyone else's) mouth all at once, but it was fun to imagine.  I started to dismantle it and each bite was delicious.  The Pizza Burger came out very similar to the picture- basically a personal pizza created on the top half of your bun and an 8oz prime beef patty beneath creating a mouth watering masterpiece.  See my pics.  :)  This was our second visit and we have been pleased both times.  They post a Calendar of Events and have live music Thursdays thru Saturdays.    I think our next visit will be on a Tuesday for Dollar Oyster Night.  This place could become a regular haunt for us...",

It's in a pretty good location (as the Strip District is known for their numerous restaurants + close proximity to Downtown Pitt), and street parking was really easy to find. We asked for a booth in our reservation, which we did not get, but the hostess was very apologetic and brought us to a table with minimal background noise level.  We started off with mixed drinks/cocktails, which were tasty (and super strong!)   For appetizer, we chose calamari. Contrary to my previous experiences of receiving subpar calamari at other Pittsburgh restaurants, this dish was light and had a great texture. It was crispy on the outside (definitely fried to order!) and the inside was chewy (but not rubbery).   Unfortunately, I found the entrees and desserts to be on the mediocre end. Both dishes were salty and unimpressive. We usually don't order dessert, but we felt that something sweet was necessary to balance the saltiness of the meal.   This restaurant will be memorable not because of their food, but because of the occasion behind it.",

Live music with a local cover band was available during my visit here. It was kind of empty when I went, which made the vibe a little so-so. I may be spoiled living in the San Francisco Bay Area with the plethora of high quality cioppinos at my fingertips, but I was satisfied with my dinner nonetheless. With the many other restaurants options in the strip district, I don't think I'll be in a rush to return. Food was fine but nothing memorable.",

    "text": "My wife and I celebrated our Anniversary here on a Saturday night.  I made reservations about 3 weeks ahead of time.  We were looking for a nice restaurant that received good Yelp reviews and one that we had never been to before.  This one did both for us so we tried them out.     I saw on their website that they have complimentary valet service after 5 on the weekends so we used that.  I found it on the side of the restaurant and they parked our car while we walked in.  They sat us in a four-seat table in the middle of the floor.  It wasn't bad.   We got a waiter by the name of Todd.  He was an older gentlemen.  A little slow but nice.  He gave us the drink and the food menu to look over.  On the Yelp app when you check in you can get a free appetizer here if you buy two entrees.  I showed that to our waiter and he said he had never seen it before but he would check with his boss to make sure we could use it on any appetizer.  He came back and he said we can choose whatever appetizer that we would like for free.  Boom!!! That was great so we went with the shrimp cocktail.   The shrimp came out and we received our own plates.  There were two large shrimp on each of our plates with Artisan lettuce on the side.  The shrimp with their homemade cocktail sauce was delicious.  They gave so much Artisan lettuce on the plate I joked with my wife that this was a small salad.  She then put some oil from the bread that they gave us on the lettuce and made a small salad.  I did the same thing it was good!  Speaking of the bread we destroyed that too.  We don't usually eat bread but we were hungry and it was good.   My wife ordered a drink that she enjoyed and I just had water.  For our entree I ordered the King Salmon and my wife ordered from their special menu of the day which was bass.   It took a little while for our food to come out but it wasn't too long of a wait.  When it came out it looked great.  My wife really liked her fish that came with polenta and we ordered a side of scallops which here delicious too.  My Salmon was good but It wasn't the best Salmon that I have tasted before.  I say that because I usually prefer it more rare and they didn't ask how I preferred it but it was still really good  4 out of 5 Salmon.     When I made my reservations I told them it was for our anniversary so they gave us complimentary cake for dessert.  I didn't understand what our waiter was saying about the dessert when he brought out their dessert menu too.  I thought he said we could pick either the cake or something off of their menu but he meant we can order something additional off of their dessert menu with our complimentary cake.  So we had ice cream cake and 3 scoops of ice cream off of their dessert menu for dessert.  I love dessert but my wife usually stays away from it but we both crushed the dessert. It was great.  Check out my wife's review to look at the pictures of our dessert.   We waited for dessert and our check for a little while.  When we got out o eat at a decent restaurant we usually are done within an hour but this took us two hours.  We still had a good time but service got slow there at the end.       Overall, it's a really nice restaurant.  I'm glad we came here for our anniversary.  If your looking for something in the Strip and want some good steak or seafood this is a good option for you.",

    "text": "This review is based solely on Friday nights at the bar/lounge area of Cioppino. I have never eaten on the dining room side. Having said that, Cioppino has lots of great free live music on Friday nights in their bar/lounge area which is quite swanky. There are bar stools, low & high top tables & a couch seating area. Bands typically play 7-11pm, no cover. They have various happy hour specials such as $2 off beer, $5 house wine & $4 off bar menu food. Their cod sandwich was outstanding and a mere $6 at happy hour (5-7) & came with a boatload of fries. I had a house Pinot Grigio. The clientele varies, but it's more upscale yet casual & draws a 35 & up crowd. I like the ambience & their food is good (but pricey if you're not there during happy hour). I've gotten away with a meal & 2 drinks during happy hour for $20, but after happy hour I've paid as much as $65 with tip for a meal & a few drinks. They have complimentary valet parking. The restaurant is tucked back on Railroad St just off Smallman. Definitely worth checking out for a nice date night or outing with girlfriends.   This is a 8/24/18 update: I have been to Cioppino about 8 times. All Friday nights for live music. The food is always good. It is pricy. This Friday I arrived to see the Midnight Express Blues Band who are all friends of mine. The bar area was empty & so no issue finding a seat. I was seated perhaps 10 minutes as the band finished their first set before they took a break. There was one bartender who the entire night seemed overwhelmed & generally not in a good mood. I like to give people the benefit of the doubt that they are having a bad day & I was told by a band member that she was indeed not having a good day due to car issues & that she was usually more upbeat & friendly. Anyway, I wasn't waited on in 10 minutes or so & then that band finished & sat next to me & got meals & drinks. I noticed a set of menus has been placed in front of me while my back was turned & I was talking, but it was literally 1/2 hour before I was ever asked if I wanted a drink! I was not in a hurry, but did order food as soon as I ordered my drink fearing another long wait. Then she was back & had forgotten what ordered to drink. A male server brought my burger & I had asked when ordering for mayo & mustard on the side, but there were no condiments & the guy walked away before I could ask. So another 10 min go by before I could get the bartender's attention. I got the mayo & mustard but each time it seemed like an irritation to her & I just got a bad vibe. When I ordered a second drink & more water it was again 10 min before I received it. No one ever ask if my burger was prepared ok or if I needed anything else. So, as you can see, I gave Cioppino 5 stars in the past & this is the first not up to par experience I've had there. But if this had been my first visit I'd be inclined not to return based on tonight's service. Hopefully next time I return the bartender will not be having a bad night & not let her bad mood reflect on patrons. I usually tip 20%, but only 15% tonight.",

Service: Very Good - Everyone was extremely friendly and professional. The place is in a great location and has a nice open feel and decor.  Overall: Not Recommend - I did not visit the cigar section, only the resturant. However, this place is leaps and bounds from being able to present a tasty and descent plate of food for the price. The space itself is wonderful but not a destination for anything else. Hoping some drastic improvements (salt) in the kitchen happens or they might as well take away the resturant part of their name.",

    "text": "Based on last night's dinner I am raising Cioppino's rating to 4 stars, although it is rounded up from 3.6 or so. The menu, while limited, featured a couple of items of interest. We tried the fried squash blossoms, which were very good. Our entres were crab cakes and a seafood pasta, both of which were satisfying. Service was excellent. The detractors remain from last visit. It's a little too loud in the dining room when the band is playing in the bar. Then there's the award winning wine list, which is legitimately impressive, but lacks any reasonably priced bottles. The lowest priced California Chardonnay is $55, a little high for an everyday dinner. The price was fair for the bottle, but more than I wanted to spend. We would visit more often if there were some lower priced wine selections.",

I ordered the Chilean sea bass Oscar and let me tell you... it was some of the best fish I have ever had. The dish was flavorful and melt in your mouth. I could order that every time and be satisfied!   Our dessert was absolutely incredible. We got the sampler of fresh beignets, banana walnut French toast, chocolate covered bacon, chocolate Guinness cake, creme brulee, and house made turtles.

We originally had a reservation for the dining room, but elected to stay in the lounge to eat instead.    - They have a good happy hour and live music on some nights.  We thoroughly enjoyed the music and appreciated that it started at 7.   - The service at our bar table was excellent.   Our server was friendly, prompt, and helpful.    - The appetizers we had and the sea bass dish were all really good.  The sea bass definitely could have used something to round out the meal. It was a decent portion of fish and a little asparagus - no starch.  - They will give you a parking ticket to get out of the Cork Factory garage if you ask.       The \"eh\": - The service at the bar itself always feels a little stuffy to me. I much preferred our waiter at the table.    - The first table we sat at was in the sun.  The blind that would have fixed that was broken/removed, so we ended up relocating.    - The crab cake entree was not great. It had potential, but there were quite a few shells and that completely ruined it for me.   The bacon and brussels mac and cheese was good, but I couldn't pick out a brussels sprout in it at all.  There was a bit of bacon, but it just wasn't what I expected from the menu description.  Our server offered a free dessert or drink because of the shells, which I appreciated.    Overall, I like the place and would go back, but I might order differently.",

Unfortunately, the experience left much to be desired..  1. The bar area was empty except for 1-2 people sitting at the bar. I said there would be 3 of us and the hostess told me to sit anywhere. For how empty it was, it took an exceptionally long time for a server to finally take our order.  2. I was excited to see that they offered a great happy hour selection. Each of us ordered a glass of red wine. When they arrived at the table, my glass had a more generous pour than the rest, but was obviously the end of the bottle. It had a foul smell and taste. For someone who rarely sends anything back, I couldn't get past it and had to send it back.  3. 2/3 of us ordered the smoked chicken tacos. The description is \"house smoked chicken, lettuce, spicy salsa, and pepper jack cheese.\" When they arrived at the table, the chicken had a black film or skin on it which made it look very unappealing.The \"spicy salsa\" could not really be classified as a salsa. It was 2-3 chunks of tomatoes with TONS of onions. After taking one bite, the chicken was chewy and the onion extremely overpowering. We waited to talk to the server and she said she would send a manager to the table.  4. When the manager approached the table, he stood with his hands on his hips and did not want to hear anything we had to say. He said the tacos are one of their best sellers and maybe we weren't familiar with \"smoked\" chicken.   I am giving them 2 stars because they eventually did comp Tacos, but there was nothing professional about our interaction with management. Needless to say, we will not be returning.   4. When the server returned",

We know \"holidays' can we a busier time, and we never usually go out on v-day, but because we love this place, we decided to go. They sat us in the bar area for dinner, so it was just pretty loud. They weren't particularly busy, so I am not sure why this was. Our server (didnt even get her name) was not friendly at all. She hardly came by our table, and then another server showed up at the end of our meal to pick up our plates that had been just sitting there for a while. It did seem like they were short staffed because we went to the cigar room and it was packed. The server/bartender in there was the only one, so she was less than pleasant also, but I suppose I might get frustrated trying to serve the needs of 30 plus people in a room and being the only one. Overall, I am not sure we would be back soon. The food was good, my husband had the ribeye and I had the crab cakes. If anything, we would go back for the food, but the usual atmosphere and service just kinda stunk.",

    "text": "This is a 3.5 star review, and I feel bad rounding down, but even though it was nice, it just missed the spot in ways that a restaurant at this price point shouldn't. The Friday evening started off on a great note and just went on a very gradual slide down.  The space is very nice, with a warm feel. Sometimes you can smell the waft of cigar smoke from the bar. I was choosing between the tuna tatare and the calamari for my appetizer. The waiter steered me toward the tuna, and it was excellent. It came with some super-crusty slices of bread, and that alone was actually worth writing home about. My boyfriend got one of the appetizer specials, smoked salmon, which was also delicious.  The main courses: cioppino and lobster ravioli. After the appetizers, I had very high hopes for their namesake dish, and unfortunately I was disappointed. It came out with just some sauce, and the broth was poured on at the table. Despite my pulling the crostini out onto my side plate immediate, the bottom section was already soggy, meaning it must have been sitting in the sauce for a little while. The seafood was generally good, nothing special. I wondered about the freshness because some of the fish, while tasty, seemed a bit too fishy. The clams/mussels were a little on the tough side. The crab was the best, but there was hardly any. But what really did it in for me was that the broth was far too salty. One of favorite things is cleaning up a good soup with bread, and I actually left a good amount of broth at the end because I couldn't take it any more. It was very sad. The lobster ravioli had a very subtle lobster flavor, which meant that the flavor was more about the pasta, which was quite doughy. I just had a taste, and didn't want a second.  I wouldn't order either entree again. Then dessert. We were quite full, and I didn't have enough space to try the warm chocolate cake, which is my normal go-to. Instead we shared a fairly large portion of tiramisu, which was good-not-great and a bit rich. We also had an Irish coffee, which was too much whiskey and not enough coffee--more like a coffee Irish. We were too full to finish dessert and not inclined to finish the drink.  And then we waited. And waited. And waited. After an evening of attentive service, our waiter just disappeared. At first it was excusable, and we weren't in a rush and were enjoying the evening together. Then it became annoying. Finally, after almost 20 minutes, I went looking for our waiter with half a mind to \"accidentally\" bump into the manager (I didn't). We got the check, validated parking saving $2, and went on our way.  I would probably go back, but maybe just for appetizers and to give that warm chocolate cake a shot. Overall dinner was too expensive for the restaurant to not maintain its high note, especially since it's clearly capable of reaching it in the first place.",

While their food was good but pricey (they had the special of the day swordfish and the scallops) my dish, the signature Cioppino, was horrific.  The brown slimy sauce was poured over my dish for show in front of the whole table.  An entire prawn isn't necessary, for goodness sakes.  My dish clearly had seafood from the weekend (it was Tuesday).  We won't return because the stench of cigar smoke is thick within the restaurant, even though we sat as far away from the cigar bar as is physically possible.  Sorry guys, it's just okay.    Also, I shouldn't have to pay for valet parking when it's literally ten steps from the curb.  I can park it myself since it doesn't require moving three cars.  Sheesh.",

    "text": "Took my Fiance here for a week-late valentines day dinner, and had an exceptional meal.  We started with the tuna tartar, and its the only reason that I gave 5 stars instead of 6.  The tuna itself was good, just a little bland, although it was served with garlic toast points that definitely made it better.  For dinner we shared the scallops and lobster ravioli.  (we ordered one of each and then split the two dishes between us)  The scallops were some of the best I've ever had - and with a mom and aunt who live on cape cod, I'm used to good seafood.  There were little bits of butter poached lobster scattered around the plate which just made you want to get every last little bit.  For dessert I ordered a creme brule, and I have to say it was exceptional.  I'm a bit of a purist here and so I was very happy to see it was just a vanilla bean c.b. - not any of the 'fancy' flavors that try to disguise poor custard.  This was excellent.  The custard alone would have been great, however it was served in a very long, shallow dish providing the perfect ratio of crispy brule sugar to custard.    I highly recommend this restaurant for either a romantic night, or a dinner with friends if you feel like treating yourself to something special.  Our waitress was excellent, and when she heard we were celebrating valentines day she even brought over two complimentary glasses of champagne with dessert.",

Our server was excellent, wine was delicious and the food very very good. We lingered over dinner for some time without being rushed but were still treated with appropriate attentiveness. As for the food, lobster risotto for an appetizer, yummy with generous chunks of lobster. The rice itself perhaps slightly to 'the tooth', but the favors made up for it. Crab cakes outstanding, pasta with mussels and clams outstanding. If I have complaint, the linguine and sauce was uninteresting and did not do a lot to enhance cw the seafood. However, the shellfish was so good we asked our server for an additional portion and he brought another huge bowl. We were too full for dessert but did opt for after drinks. Could've ordered seconds. Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "I was here last night and was relatively impressed with the beautiful space.  I didn't get a chance to sit in the dining room, but the bar area itself was pretty nice with plenty of seating and a better than average tequila selection.  They also had plenty of draft beer options . The area itself has high ceilings,nice lighting, beautiful ceiling fans, really dark wood, a couple of plasmas and plenty of leather.  The wine selection is decent and has plenty of options by the glass.  We ordered a few of the \"small plates\" while we sat at the bar.  However, you have the option to order off of the full menu, small plates menu, and bar menu.  I think it's a bit silly to have three different menus for your options while you sit at the bar.  It seems that if you can order anything off of any menu then their is no need for three different menus.  Anyways, we started with the beef carpaccio, which was a bit above average served with parmigiano-reggiano, olive oil and roasted peppers.  The flavors melded pretty well together and the roasted peppers were nice albeit a bit oversoaked in olive oil.  The tuna tartare was okay.  I guess the tuna was of decent quality, but it was served a bit above room temperature which is a mistake. I think tartare should be served room temperature or a bit below.  I really liked the cured meats selection, which was served with a nice selection of olives and three different meats.  The prosciutto (sp?) was delicious and served room temperature which is correct.  We also had a few slices of a delicious salami and sopressata.  This is a good option for under $7.  In fact overall I found the prices to be quite reasonable.  Finally, we ended with a trio of delicious lamb burgers.  This was my favorite from last night.  It was three perfectly cooked medium flavorful lamb burgers served with perfectly caramalized onions on warm, buttery soft bread with a sheeps milk blue cheese.  I really appreciated this cheese because it was a milder blue cheese and did not overpower the meat.  We stopped in the cigar bar after dinner and I was quite pleased with the space.  We sat on the comfy large leather couches and were served our martinis quickly.  Overall this is a good place and I'm glad to see we have a decent cigar bar in Pittsburgh.  I'll sample the full dinner menu the next time I visit.",

    "text": "Hate cigars or any type of smoke? Then do not come here. This place has a cigar bar and the smell carries into the dining room - it is faint but definitely there. However, if you don't mind then continue reading.   Went here about a month ago and could not have been more pleased. The waiter, I think his name was Gary was extremely friendly and very knowledgeable. They start you out with delicious bread and an infused olive oil to dip. I will tell you that we ate enough for four people but I'm not going to be bashful because the meal was absolutely delicious.   To start, my husband had the oysters on the  1/2 shell which he had absolutely no complaints about. I ordered the short rib polenta as an appetizer and it was to die for! For dinner my husband ordered the Elysian Fields Lamb which was done three ways and he liked every bite! I ordered the scallops  with risotto and lobster cream and I would definitely recommend it. There was enough food on this plate for two. I was torn between this and the crab cakes and a couple next to us ordered them and I was slightly jealous.   We should have stopped here but we forged on and ordered the Sampler which came with chocolate Guinness cake, chocolate covered bacon, homemade turtle chocolates, banana French toast and who knows what else.  For $10 this was a steal but I wasn't thrilled. Nothing about the dessert was all that special and it may have been because we got ahead of ourselves. But if you go with a group and want to have something for a table, you could order this.   The only complaint that I had was their choice of seating. We went on a Friday night and were the only ones there when we arrived around 6 pm. By the time we were done, the place was about half full but you would not have known that because all of the tables around us were filled. I would recommend that they space couples out a little more so that people do not feel like they are in each other's conversations. Luckily, the couple on one side didn't have much to say and the men to the other side were seated when we were having dessert.",

My wife had the pork chop with Brussels sprouts and I had the lamb for our entrees and once again we both came away impressed. The pork chop was seasoned and cooked perfectly and was very juicy, the lamb was excellent as well and I would order it again. I enjoyed the presentation but didn't feel the lentils added to the dish, and would have preferred a more traditional starch. Pumpkin cheesecake was good but the star of the dish for me was the cranberry compote, great contrast to the sweet of the cheesecake.

We were a table of 8, the amount of time just to get drinks was unbelievable. I was drinking beer so I was served in a responsible amount of time. We ordered a bottle of wine and it took almost 30 minutes to bring to the table and pour. Those that ordered mixed drinks took the same amount of time. The food was good but the service is so slow. We had reservations at 7:30 and did not get finished until 10:00pm. This was not due to a stretched out service but to the lack of attention.  With all of the other choices in town I will not go here again, too pricey for bad service. Since we were a party of 8 tip was added in automatically and looked like we were charged twice which totally ruined the evening.",

The menu was great with multiple options that looked great... hard to choose. We shared toasted octopus appetizer and loved it, so tender (they braise it first). Next up was ciopinno for him and sea scallops with lobster risotto for me. Excellent and not so huge that you feel gluttonous after. Which meant room for dessert -- we went with Megan's sampler.... every item was so good -- mini beignets, chocolate covered bacon, Guinness cake, turtles -- and plenty for sharing. Our waitress was extremely good, knowledgeable and friendly while professional. As was the other staff. Definitely one I want to come back know to time and again.",

Guys night out...Add the cigar bar to #1. The food is excellent quality.  The staff is professional and courteous and the prices for the quality are below average.  On a side note, I recently took my brother and the guys here for his bachelor party.  Its was a huge success.  They did everything right to ensure that we had a nice evening.  Which was good because the 4 hours we spent their before the limo arrived to whisk us off for the 2nd half of our night flew by!

The room was really dark so unless you were interested in the jazz I'd suggest sitting in the dining room. Once my date arrived we made our way to the dining room. We were greeted quickly and water was immediately brought over. We placed our drink orders while we looked over the menu. Prices are high-this will not be an inexpensive evening out. I ordered the crab cakes with mac and cheese. The crab cakes had a lemony flavor and were served over a \"creamy cocktail\" sauce. They were tasty but I still prefer Sausalido's crab cakes. The mac and cheese was meh. Something similar to farfalle pasta with a cheese sauce. Butcher and the Rye has superior mac and cheese. My date ordered the scallops with the lobster risotto. He said it was good and it must have been as he cleaned his plate. Now I did not see our bill but I saw the menu prices so I basically know how much it was and if I had to pay for this meal, it would have not been worth it to me. Much better places to eat at in the Strip and Pittsburgh in general that are superior in quality and less expensive. I don't feel the need to return unless to listen to music in the bar area and just have drinks.",

    "text": "This is without a doubt my FAVORITE (at least upscale) restaurant in Pittsburgh.  One that I don't get to as much as I would like because it is on the pricey side, but if DH and I have some extra cash and want a nice date night this is the place we go.  We've eaten there three times and each time have received excellent food, quick and friendly service, and have left full and satisfied.  I've eaten at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, the Sundial Restaurant in Atlanta, and several other upscale steak places, and Cioppino makes my favorite.  Normally we get the large steak and split it and several sides, but their steaks are good enough that I could probably gorge myself and eat a whole one myself!  As far as parking goes, I believe they offer free valet parking, but we can usually find a spot on the street close to the restaurant so we normally just park and walk.  I could be wrong about the valet, so don't take my word on that one.  I've never been informed of a dress code, but it seems like people normally dress in business-type attire -- hubby normally wears slacks and a polo or button down shirt and I wear casual dresses or slacks and a blouse.  There is a cigar bar right next door but we have never been so I can't comment on the bar.  I will mention that when they are having jazz nights next door the sound does sometimes travel into the restaurant a bit but it isn't excessively loud.  The smell of cigars, etc, does NOT travel.  The decor is understated but upscale.  Dark tables and comfortable chairs, candles on the tables, and low lighting.  Definitely romantic.    The food.  Ahhhhh, the food.  I wish I could eat at this place for lunch and dinner at least twice a week.  The food is so good!@  A breakdown of what we've tried:  Beef Carpaccio -- sooooooo good.  We cleared the plate.  The beef was sliced and seasoned perfectly and practically melted in our mouths.  Tuna Tartara -- this is the only thing I've eaten at Cioppino that I didn't love.  Although I don't think it had anything to do with the way it was prepared -- I think I just don't really like tuna tartara.  Roasted Root Vegetables -- it looks like these aren't on the current menu.  But <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Foh.my&s=276e2ebc350073d2f8621da53e522ee7e0b3af05e71440977ab5e373881b8943\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">oh.my</a>.goodness.  If you go and they are on the menu -- ORDER THEM!  Roasted carrots, parsnips, and turnips so soft and sweet and a little bit salty.  The flavors of all three are so different but complement each other perfectly.  And that bitter flavor that turnips have?  Totally gone when roasted.    Parmesan Risotto -- delicious.  Some of the best risotto I've had -- I would postulate that they make this the \"real\" way by toasting the rice first and then laboriously adding broth ladle-by-ladle until the risotto is done.  It's always creamy and soft (maybe slightly al-dente) and very flavorful.  I've had risotto from a few restaurants that is just chewy and flavorless, but this stuff is AWESOME.  Macaroni and Cheese -- this isn't your typical Kraft-style mac and cheese, folks.  The noodles are cooked perfectly and it's obvious they use high-quality cheese -- just a bit sharp, and the sauce is just the right consistency.  Steak -- we specifically get the 14 oz. strip and split it.  The steaks are juicy, seasoned perfectly, and always come the way we order them (which by the way, is medium rare).  I've never run into gristle or any other problems with the quality of the cuts they use.    Coffee and Donuts -- we went on a limb and tried this.  It wasn't *quite* what I expected.  When I read beignets, I imagined crisp \"elephant ear\" style pastry like is served in New Orleans.  These are more like donuts holes, are are puffy and soft.  Tossed in sugar and served with dipping sauce they were good, but didn't blow me away.  Creme Brulee -- when we went it wasn't the one that is currently on the menu, it was plain creme brulee.  And it was the best I've ever had.  Now, I'm no aficionado (I've had it maybe 5 times in my life) but this is what I imagine creme brulee is SUPPOSED to be.  Crisp sugar on top so that when you hit it with your spoon it cracks, and creamy custard-y deliciousness underneath.  I would order this dessert every time I went if I could.  Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend this restaurant.  Maybe for a nice business dinner and DEFINITELY  for a date -- take someone you want to impress out for a nice dinner with a great atmosphere, great food, and great service.",

The longer version:  I have eaten here several times now, both in the bar and in the dinning room.  The Chef here is top notch as demonstrated by his outstanding specials that never cease to inspire.  He really has a way with fish/seafood that i have not seen many other places.  From the sinfully rich sea scallops and lobster risotto to the delicate taste of the swordfish special i've had, its all impressive.   Since it is a seafood and chophouse, the steaks are also a highlight.  The fillet comes with a Gruyere & onion bread pudding sidedish that is just a perfect compliment.   The bar has a smaller menu with a great burger and other munchies.  They have a great selection of draft beers and an entertaining live band thursdays and fridays.  You can also get the full menu in the bar.  the wait staff are great, my wife and i are regulars pretty much and always recognized and greeted warmly.  The Chef himself will often stop by and chat about the meal and say hi, again the personal touch that makes this place well worth the visit.  Advice, make a reservation.  Also the desserts by Meaghen are too good, i have been stalking the guiness cake for a month now, i hope it comes back soon.",

    "text": "Way to go, Pittsburgh, on some solid food! Upon my aunt booking the reservation, they asked if we would be dining for a special occasion. Unbeknownst to me at the time, it was apparently their anniversary, and she happened to tell the hostess. When we were seated, the menu was personalized to read, \"Happy Anniversary X and X!\" It was pretty great.  And I really enjoyed not having to find parking in that area as they offer complimentary valet parking. Score!  Now onto the food. Let's start with their in-house water bubbling system (those exist??). For $3.25 or $3.50, you can get unlimited sparkling water that has been bubbled on-site.  Apparently, it's a thing, but it's super cool, and I appreciated it.  Their bread was pretty average, but I found myself going after more pieces of bread than expected only because their dipping oil which is a combination of olive oil and pesto was absolutely phenomenal! Appetizers change with what's available/in season, but our party shared the Short Ribs, Halibut cheek, and antipasta, and we were more than satisfied.  Salads were nicely seasoned and dressed. Someone in my party got the \"cioppino\" which isn't much of a surprise since one would hope that a restaurant named after a dish would have perfected it, but I opted against that idea.  After a wonderful experience trying cioppino on the piers of San Francisco where it all really began, I opted for something else.  That something else was crab cakes and mac n' cheese. I have never had crab cakes quite as good as these before.  Truly.  Though Pittsburgh isn't really anywhere near the ocean, the crab was undeniably fresh. Places have a bad habit of over-seasoning crab cakes, but not Cioppino in Pittsburgh! It was seasoned just enough to add a little kick but it didn't overpower the natural flavor of the crab meat. And in a strange way, the cakes stayed together while also flaking apart perfectly. That mac n' cheese was pretty incredible, too with a light dusting of breadcrumbs! From what I hear, the halibut (main dish), lamb, lobster risotto, and cioppino eaten by others in my party were pretty great.  So great, that nothing remained on anyone's dishes.  Dessert was okay. It's one of two things that bring Cioppino's rating down from a 5 to a 4 for me. I got the molasses cake, and though it was tasty, it was nothing like what I expected based on its description on the menu. For some odd reason, it tasted very \"Guinness\"-ey to me. My cousin ordered two flavors of gelato and one ended up having to go back to the kitchen because it tasted as if the milk used had gone bad. We eventually received an apology from the kitchen and were told that the gelato flavor would be taken out of circulation - meaning there was something definitely wrong with it. Mu aunt and uncle shared the \"sampler\" and though the majority of the desserts on their platter were good, their version of chocolate covered bacon wasn't so scrumptious.  We all agreed after tasting it that it probably would have tasted better if they used milk instead of dark chocolate and if it was a room temperature chocolate as opposed to semi-solid/melted chocolate.   My last gripe about the place is their service. Food comes out SLOWLY. Our reservation was at 6, and by the time we actually left, it was almost 10pm. Four hours for dinner? Really? There were significant gaps between courses and it was a nightmare trying to get a hold of our server throughout the night. I was practically dancing in my seat trying to get his attention.  Don't get me wrong, when we finally had his attention, he was super attentive, but just trying to get it was quite the hassle.   Would I return? Absolutely! Would I suggest this place to others? Of course! There a just a few kinks that they need to work out and that you, dear reader, need to be prepared for. Buon appetito!",
