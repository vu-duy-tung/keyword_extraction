    "text": "Terrible!  I came here based off the previous reviews.  I was going to hit up KFC... kicking myself for not...this place is off the 51 in burgh which is by far one of the worst roads and must have a high suicide rate.  Every time I'm on the 51 I want to run myself off the road out of irritation by the constant stop and go and the grind of that road seriously it's awful.  My thoughts initially though was that Frisch's is worth it because it gets 5 stars and the chicken looked great in a previous yelpers photo.  I stopped in around 7:30pm last night and being that it was a Saturday night it was open until 10p.  Anyway, I arrive at Frisch's and notice immediately that the place is not well kept.  I even watched someone cleaning a counter with a dirty rag that was probably used for weeks.  Dirty rags don't clean they need to be washed...seriously, the place is gross.  It just had a feeling of people cutting corners and not giving a F@*k.  I should have left...instead I figured I'd just take the chicken to go.  I noticed some very old chicken and pizza together in a heat box that you typically see in gas stations.  You know, food that's been sitting around forever.  I ordered a chicken dinner, nope, they didn't have any chicken (or so I was told).  They said it would be at least a half hour wait.  Say what!?  I knew this was my chance to escape this hell hole.  I cancelled my order and darted.  Never to return...dirty, carelessness, no chicken at a chicken spot on a Saturday evening, located near one of the worst roads I've ever encountered...good-bye Frisch's.  I made my decision to cut you out and after I type this sentence I won't look back again.  Peace!",

The menu says all sandwiches come with a pickle and chips. I asked about that when I noticed my to go order didn't have those. The woman told me that's only when you eat in.... What?!? Then I should have paid less? She was nice and got me a side of chips to go. Minus the side issue, the sandwiches were on point. Made fresh with tons of meat. The place itself is very outdated as far as the searing area. It's definitely stuck in the 90s. Some small updates would go very far. I plan on stopping in again to eat in this time and get my pickle and chips. Ha.",

Broasting is...well, who knows and who cares. Broasting creates delectable \"fried\" chicken without the grease. Deliciously seasoned, crisp exterior and juicy interior. I prefer the wings, but all the cuts are delicious. I also really adore their coleslaw. It's got more tang than cream, just the way my gram used to make it. The fries are just ok, but I remember the broasted potatoes being pretty special so next time id order those.  You order from a cafeteria style line where you can make a salad from the pretty impressive salad bar, or pick up a boxed dessert on your way to the register. They then bring your food out to the table when it's ready. Be warned, the Broasting process takes 20-30 minutes, which is totally worth the wait. They do call ahead orders but I kind of like chatting with my dining companions while I wait!",

The variety of vegetables is very good but they need to label the salad dressings.  The chicken is crispy and nicely seasoned.  It's still fried chicken but supposedly pressure cooking imparts less oil.  This seemed True enough for this bird as it wasn't greasy, just delicious.  The staff is friendly and I love the place.

They were timely, efficient, friendly, and the food that day was outstanding! As a caterer the prices were very reasonable and they gave us so much food, I had a hard time believing that was only for what we requested- I think they may have given us extra which is awesome. They left the warmers at the buffalo inn while we were there and came back at the end to pack up the left overs and take their warmers. And they were nice enough to ask how everything went and congratulate us- didn't expect that from a local restaurant with a catering side business. I knock off some stars because I typically find their meals to be too greasy and sit down meals take a long time for just fried food. But as a casual caterer, I would recommend them to anyone!",

    "text": "KFC and Popeye's are DEAD. They just don't know it yet.   Long live Frisch's.   Who is Jack, and why is his \"Famous Broasted Chicken\" so damn good? Why is it so damn tender, flavorful? Why is it coated so perfectly, so crispily (is that a word?), so richly?   What is \"broasting\" you ask? It's when something is cooked in a pressure fryer, a colossal metallic coffin full of hot oil.   In other words, you ain't buyin' one for home use anytime soon unless you start up a website like Google or something and become the next Steve Jobs, who may or may not be reading this.  Frisch's is novel in that it is not only a restaurant, one with a massive menu that includes not only that incredible broasted chicken but also pizza, burgers, wings, sandwiches, salads, and side dishes, but is also a deli with all sorts of lunchmeats and salads behind a glass case frosted with cold air.  I always love walking into places like this and getting a whiff of all that chilled meat.   I hadda walk out with my gallon of Schneider's Iced Tea too. We were out of it! Gulp! What other eatery sells that honeyed, lemoned, cloudy ambrosia in a plastic jug?   The dining area in the back is really nice and modern in a vaguely retro way. It kind of reminds me of an old-fashioned carhop diner. You order upfront, and they bring your meal to your table. Yet, a large screen TV glows in the center of the room. I like eating there when I can, but tonight it was takeout.  Speaking of retro and carhops, Caste Village, the shopping center Frisch's dwells in, was having one of their Car Cruises. That means '57 Chevy's and 60 year old guys with jet black pompadours. What a trip daddy-o! I thought I saw Porky Chedwick!  As for Frisch's potato salad, its the website with the viking kittens doing Zep, meaning it is rathergood. Normally I don't care for \"sweet\" potato salads (you can usually tell it'll be that way if the dressing appears yellowish since it means they put sweet pickles in it), but I like Frisch's. It's not too sweet that it overpowers the salad. And of course it's full of crunchy veggies. It battles nearly every tater salad out there to a full 12 rounds.   Their cole slaw is excellent also. Again, crunchy, sweet, and a little bit soggy makes for the best slaw. Always.   Tell me people, what better sides are there to have with fried chicken? Who the heck wants mashed potatoes and gravy? Especially in the summer!  Why go the fast food route for fried chicken when you have a place like Frisch's around? Where else can you get chicken this mouthwatering with sides that more than hold up their end and aren't just there as a formality, y'know?  I mean, why do KFC and and Popeye's even bother with sides?   KFC does have pretty good slaw, but everything Frisch's offers makes the Colonel and Mr. Copeland each walk away arguing bitterly over how to take down Frisch's once and for all in their brain-transplanted robotic bodies (ya think they're really dead? BAH!). Let's hope no one deduces and filches their recipes.",

We usually get the buckets - all dark meat or all white meat.   They also have deals with sides included.  We have also ordered larger trays of their broasted chicken for family gatherings and it was a hit!  We usually pair it with sides of their homemade coleslaw and special bowtie pasta salad - both excellent.     If you never had anything \"broasted\". ..you must try it.   It is a special way of cooking under high pressure.  It makes the chicken very moist and juicy, but still crispy on the outside.  Same with the Potato wedges. Less greasy than fried.  They are also known for their great fried fish sandwiches - huge portions.  I have been going to them since I was a kid (they used to be near the old Isaly's in Carrick - Frisch's Carrick Poultry- until they moved to Caste Village).    They have a restaurant, full service deli, six-packs to-go of beer/wine coolers, outdoor seating -if weather permits, and homemade soups (also available frozen in pints and quarts).  Everything is made fresh, and it takes time to broast, so call ahead for take-out, at least 30 min for take-out and if you eat there - it's worth the wait.  Food is excellent.  We usually only get take-out.   If you are passing through the area,  give them a try. You will be hooked on the \"broasting\"!",

But, chicken aside, Frisch's is a great place for soups, salads, sandwiches, pizza and more. I LOVE the idea of Frisch's. You first walk in through a deli. Need any meats and cheese for the rest of the week's lunch? Grab them on your way out. Sliced fresh. In the back of the deli is a cafeteria style line up. Reminds me of the best part of those long high school days . . . Lunch. You go to the end, grab a tray, hit up the salad bar if you like, some fresh pizza by the slice, a piece of cake already portioned, order whatever food you like at the register when you pay and they will bring it out to you. Oh, and did I forget to mention DRAFT beer? Four different drafts (Miller Lite, Sam Adams seasonal, Yuengling) each is $1.75 a draft in a frosted mug. Yes, you heard me. $1.75! And to boot, they offer daily specials ( such as Isaly's chip, chop ham) which include a fountain drink or draft beer. Then you sit down in the (surprisingly) cute dinning room with cozy fireplace and big screen t.v. where they bring you the rest of your order. Although I have only lived in the area for 2 weeks, I have already been to Frisch's 3 times. My favorite food so far has actually been the soups. They have a several soups o the day and I have yet to be disappointed. Near Caste Village? Stop at Frisch's for lunch. ou wn't be disappointed.",

And I don't know what was inside the beer batter that were supposed to be mushrooms, but again I could taste nothing but the batter. They must chop the mushrooms in pieces because half of them were the size of an M&M peanut. TERRIBLE!!!!!!

For $8.99 I got a breast, thigh, drumstick and wing all very moist and hot out of the fryer. The broasted chicken dinner also comes with a choice of potato and cole slaw. I got roasted potato wedges which were also good   You get a big serving at a reasonable price. They also serve some beer so if you want a draft beer instead of a fountain drink with your food you can do that.   It took a little while for the food to come out, but it was worth it because it came out hot and freshly cooked. You could tell the chicken wasn't sitting around and dried out.",

Despite this, the place has a loyal following, especially for their fried chicken.  I feel many people simply come back here because hey have been coming for so long, rather than because the food is good.  I have had a lot of different meals here, but the one that I will say is far above average is their pasta salad.  You can buy it in bulk too which is great for summer parties.",

I had a mozzarella chicken and tomato sandwich, and my boyfriend had a breaded chicken sandwich (this was a huge portion size)! We also had a side of fries and cheesy potato soup that came with it too. All of the food tasted good and it didn't take too long for our order to be ready. Prices are decently fair and they also have a nice deli and beer selection available. We will be returning in the future.",

    "text": "The Broasted Chicken is the bomb. I don't know how I never thought to come here during all those twenty-some years I lived in the South Hills. I mean, I guess I do know why and it's because the place doesn't look fancy on the outside (and neither is it on the inside). The front is a deli, so unless you want a pound of chipped ham or whatever meat and cheeses you need for your lunches, you wouldn't think to come in. Beyond the deli counter is a separate room that houses the kitchen and the dining room. It looks like a cafeteria, but I would definitely not call their food cafeteria food. Simple concept: you order at the counter, they give you a number and they bring your food to you when it's ready.  My husband and I were in the area and after reading other reviews, we both went with the Broasted Chicken Dinner. For $8.29, it comes with cole slaw and a choice of potato; I got the broasted and he got the mashed. The chicken dinner seriously is half a chicken: you get a thigh, a breast and a whole wing. Whatever magic they're doing in the kitchen, this chicken is crunchy on the outside, so incredibly moist on the inside and it's seasoned to perfection. Forget KFC, this is the place to go for breaded chicken and for an incredibly affordable price too. The cole slaw was delicious, mostly tangy and sweet, and just the slightest bit creamy. The broasted potatoes, which are just wedge potatoes, were pretty darn good. Again, crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. Perfection.   Although it's not very fancy, the food is just fantastic for the price. The menu is huge so I'm sure we will be back for more!",

The first part fo the place is a deli.  They don't make individual sandwiches but they sell Boar's Head deli meats and also offer fresh buns.  You walk through the deli to get to the restaurant.  They have quite a selection.  I chose the Chicken Parm sandwich.  It came with chips and a pickle.  They had soups and daily specials.  They also have a nice little salad bar.  They even have a nice selection of desserts.  The sandwich was delivered to my table and it was freshly cooked.  It wasn't a chicken patty that was pressed chicken.  It was real chicken.  100%.  It had been flattened out a bit so the pieces were thinner and not huge pieces that would be hard to bite into.  There were 2 chicken patties on the sandwich.  The roll was fresh and stood up to the contents.  It had lots of gooey melty cheese and the marinara was really good.  My husband had the Cajun chicken sandwich.  It was just as good.  It wasn't spicy like Cajun can be sometimes, but it had a great Cajun flavor.  His sandwich came with French fries.  I may or may not have helped him eat his because they were so good.  We each took half of our sandwiches home to have for dinner.  We also each grabbed a dessert.  I'm a big fan of coconut cream pie so I picked up a piece of that .  I had am sad to say that it was disappointing.  It had no actual coconut in it.  It was just flavored.  However, my hubby got the Boston Creme Cake and loved it.  You can have broasted chicken for your meal but it takes around 20-30 minutes because they make it fresh.  We passed on it this time but we are having a family dinner next weekend and we are going to order the broasted chicken for that.  They have sides you can buy in the deli.  Great food for a great price.",

Maybe it was me a wide-eyed child, but I remember it being great.  After wanting to pick something quick up for dinner one evening, we stopped into Frisch's and placed an order fro take out. After going back and forth between the deli counter and the cafeteria-style line, we finally figured out where we needed to order since the staff seemed confused themselves.  While waiting, we checked out the deli counter, which they have seriously cut back on. The food in there didn't look too fresh. I had initially wanted to get some sides, but changed my mind after seeing what was there.  We ordered chicken and the broasted potatoes. The chicken took 40+ minutes to cook and when we got home we realized that almost every piece was a wing versus a breast piece. The potatoes were generally bland. The meal also came with cole slaw, which I'm not a huge fan of, but they forgot to include it after making a big deal about it at the register.  The food itself was soggy after a less than 5 minute ride and I was pretty disappointed. After a less than exciting meal, I wouldn't go back, especially with places like Armstrong's right around the corner.",

    "text": "I have to agree with Darren W., Frisch's Broasted Chicken blows every other fast food chicken place out of the water.  I got the #2 which is a 14 piece bucket of the Jack's Famous Broasted Chicken which also comes with a quart cole slaw and 2 orders of broasted potatoes (pretty much roasted potato wedgies) to go. I was told that it would be a 30 minute wait which was fine with us. Who wouldn't want to wait a few minutes for fresh cooked chicken verses chicken that's been sitting for hours?  We were given our number and sat down. A few minutes later an older gentlemen walked by us with a killer looking Italian Hoagie. My wife then looked at the board and saw that it was the special of the day and immediately walked up to the counter and ordered one.   About ten minutes later her hoagie and sausage and ravioli soap arrived at our table. I went right for her soap to taste it. It was spectacular and I immediately walked up to the counter to order my own! I went with a burger and the same sausage and ravioli soap. Maybe ten minutes later my burger and soap came and our chicken and sides.   Once we got home we dived in. I ate my burger, a drumstick and half of my soap and my wife ate half of her hoagie and soap and a drumstick as well. We were stuffed! My burger was so big! The beef patty itself was over an inch thick. The burger was cooked to perfection. One of the best I have ever had!   Now to the chicken. It was still piping hot even though it took me about 30 minutes to get home. It was so juicy and perfectly seasoned. Simply delicious and well worth the drive and the wait. The broasted potatoes were equally as good too. Even the cole slaw was really good and I don't even like cole slaw so that should tell you something.  Frisch's offer a ton of other things as well including soaps, sandwiches, pizza, wedgies, calzones, wings, desserts and even a salad bar!  I WILL BE BACK!",

    "text": "While on a recent Lowe's outing, on the hunt for a new refrigerator, we happened upon the good reviews for this informal, very Pittsburgh-y place and decided to give it a try. What we found was a restaurant and store combo that looks like it's been in this spot for a long while, in a good way. We entered into the store part, not knowing that the restaurant is in the back, and were greeted by a friendly and helpful guy who actually introduced himself to us with a handshake...this even before he knew it was our first time in. He directed us to the restaurant once he learned we intended on dining in, and we headed back to find more counter service, a salad bar and a diner like atmosphere. We helped ourselves to the salad bar and ordered some chicken, which they cook up fresh for you. The chicken takes at least 15 minutes, so we'll know to plan on this for our next visit, or perhaps call ahead.   The salad bar is nice, with lots of choices and some tasty cole slaw and potato salad. The chicken is the star here, however. Broasting is frying under pressure, and the meat absorbs less oil then in traditional frying. Crispy outside, juicy within, and very delicious. I tried a thigh and some wings, and liked it all. The hot sauce that comes with the wings is divine, and I will ask for this on my next visit even if I don't order the wings, as it goes well with all of the chicken parts. I will also try the broasted potatoes on my next visit, as these seem to have many fans here on Yelp. On our way out we passed tables that had ordered the pizza, so chicken isn't the only draw here. Frisch's is a fun place with friendly service and very good food.",

    "text": "Mixed review really..   We ordered from here for family game night a week ago and had amazing food! All we ordered was 20 piece broasted chicken. It was great, fed us all, lots of meat, crispy and just how we wanted it. We picked up and it was easy.   We came here again after loving it from game night and ate in, not such a great experience.. I had already tried their chicken so I went with a fish sandwich. The sandwich was ready in less than 5 minutes which was great on the service end but I'm guessing it was not fresh fish. Also, I was expecting batter dipped and fried fish on my sandwich, I was sadly mistaken. It was more like a giant fish stick, I'm very big on fish sandwiches too, so I was sad. My bun was slightly moist all over and I was overall unhappy with my meal.   After my craving not being satisfied for their chicken, we returned the next day and I ordered their broasted chicken to go. I was very pleased with the pricing on individual pieces and the portion you received. The things I was unhappy about was when we ordered before I paid, we were told it would be 10-15 minutes max because they're made fresh, which is great! I didn't mind at all, even though we were in a rush and needed to be out quickly, but I like fresh food. Then, after she swiped my card she told me it would actually be longer and that there was a call ahead order in front of me now and that he would try to squeeze my order in. I was not happy, but I sat patiently and waited. Finally after about 25-30 minutes, my chicken came to my table to go. Once I was in the car, I began to eat and my chicken was well under cooked, I was so disappointed, I really wanted it to be as good as the first time I had it. The chicken was very uncrispy and the meat was very very slimy and still pink in the middle.   Overall, the parking is easy, good location, food is hit or miss, but I will be back and will hope for the best as I try again! Will update my review next time I go.",
