I lived within walking distance, so it was perfect for stumbling home and not worrying about having to drive :)  The owners Paul and Val are some of the nicest people I've ever met and they're great with the patrons.  The food is excellent, the beer selection is great and reasonably priced, and I love \"Horneoke\" and \"Stinkyoke\" nights (and I miss those days dearly!).  This is definitely a \"regulars\" type of bar, but they're also very welcoming to new visitors as well.  You can find quite a mixture in this place...old, young, hipsters, yinzers...and everyone gets along :)  I visit this bar every time I make a trip back to Pittsburgh!",

The beer selection runs to your neighborhood tavern style selections. Don't be looking for no craft beers here! But I'm ok with that - it's what you'd expect when you walk in the door and your eyes behold all that's in front of you in it's seedy, turn of the century splendor.  Food is interesting if not superb. Good menu of diverse subs and specialty sandwiches with names like Mom's favorite or the Big Skunk. Prices are good and portion size is large. We ate at the bar - seemed to be the thing to do - so I can't attest to any of the \"restaurant\" qualities of the place.   It's a little seedy and doesn't give you the feeling you're in the cleanest place in Lawrenceville. But if I'm in the neighborhood, I'd go back! Guess it's that dive lover in me.

We arrived after 5 and ordered a menagerie of appetizers including fried zucchini, fried pickles, banana peppers, onion rings, fried mushrooms and a meatball appetizer with marinara sauce. Appetizers were $5.00 from 4-6 which was a great bargain, in addition to the deliciousness of all the appetizers.  The meatball appetizer was excellent and the marinara sauce was to die for!  The banana peppers were a little hot, but they came with cheese bread to counteract the hotness.  We also ordered an order of the fish and chips with cole slaw substituted for the chips.  Their fish is perfect (will go back for a fish sandwich soon) and the cole slaw was the best we all have tasted.  For dessert, we ordered the brownie special which had ice cream and whipped topping with hot chocolate syrup on top.  It was delicious. When we first got there, a lot of us thought we would be getting the burgers (the special for the evening) but we were so filled there was no room for the burgers.  Another great part of our dinner was our waitress Megan.  She was the best, attentive, yet not too bothersome.  She was there when we needed her and was very funny and personable.  She asked us our names and knew who we all were.  We even told the owner Val to put her on the schedule for the third Tuesday in January as we will be back for our next GNO and we want her to wait on us again.  We will be back as this restaurant/bar is fantastic.  You have to go there to see their extensive food and drink menu.  Loved everything about it!!!!",

I wandered in on a Friday afternoon and it was pretty quiet except for a handful of people pumping money into those ubiquitious slot machines that are a staple at all Pittsburgh dives.   The girl working behind the bar was friendly and the regulars that patron the place ended up being pretty friendly also. There is the awkward moment of walking into a \"regulars\" bar during slow hours were everyone sort of looks at you with a cocked eye brow and giving the \"who the hell is this guy\" vibe. But if you can weather the initial outsider feeling a regular will eventually start chatting you up and before you know it you feel like you've known everyone at Stinky's your whole life.   I heard the food is good, but when i stopped in I'd just ate lunch so this time didn't try any.",

We were gearing up to get home, devour our food get drunk and listen to 90's music.  Yup. I hadn't been to eat at stinkys for a few weeks, I felt like I had abandoned my home.   We walked in and were greeted as usual by all the employees.  Some of the customers also gave a wave, a nod, or a smile.   Our food was superb, this time I opted for a change of pace and god the ribeye wrap.  (My usualy being the wings, the chicken tenders, or the buffalo wrap).  First time having it, and it was good. I was so pleased and nostalgic that I had to go back to stinkys the next day too.  Good lord. I ordered a bloody mary and a buffalo chicken sandwich.  And everything was right in the world.  I couldn't ask for a better place to watch my pens games at.  Or, for that matter, better company.  Everything there is a True fan, an excited fan, and friendly. I love the banter during hockey games, the drink specials which always leave me walking (er, stumbling) down butler street content and slightly drunk.   If you haven't been to stinkys you should try it sometime.   But don't go during hockey games unless you plan on joining in on the screaming and fighting.",

However we actually came here to watch a high school classmate in concert, one who sounds just like Bret Michaels.   He was delayed by the Penguins playoff game though. How can one compete?  I need to go out to watch Penguins games more often. They scored as soon as we sat down in the back, away from the madding crowd, and eventually overcame a deficit to win the series.   Man this place is a quintessential Pittsburgh neighborhood bar; crowded, rowdy, and LOUDER than a Manowar gig! The hockey game just sent the folks through the roof.  Everyone was really friendly though. I had people I didn't know patting me on the back asking me how I was and all.  \"Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your naaame, and you're always glad you caaaame..\"   I dug that.   The barmaids were pretty foxy too.  Hey, I can't help that I like curvy 30-40 something chicks in tight jeans.   I wasn't hungry at all due to the Italian food and ice cream I consumed earlier in this rainy evening, but my date's sister had eyes bigger than her teeny-tiny waist, so she asked me to eat the other half of her hot sausage sandwich.  \"Oh come on. You can eat it! It'll go to waste!\"  Me the human garbage disposal. Can't finish your dinner? Give it to Darren. He'll eat it.    I'm glad I had some room for it, as it was one of the best hot sausage sandwiches I have ever eaten. The cheese, spices, onions, peppers...oh no...  Ginger ale: My savior. It settles the stomach better than Alka Seltzer, and it was served in a gorgeous, gigantic Coca-Cola glass with a little straw with a knowing smile and nod. The menu is rather huge and includes pizza, burgers, sandwiches, salads, pasta, wings, and anything else a bar might serve.   What a Saturday night! What a well-hidden secret!   It's right across the street from that wacky Zombo Gallery also. It's too bad they were closed. At least I know where it is now in case I ever want to go.  Guy Fieri needs to come here during a Steeler game! Can you imagine what great TV what would make?  Stinky's. That's Pittsburgh. Personified.",

My friends and I took a cue from the other Yelpers and went to Stinky's during a Pens game and had a great time.  We all got wings, (because who can pass up the Pens game special of $0.40 wings?!) and there were zero complaints.  I got the \"stinkers\" flavor, which I was informed was a garlic, hot and bbq mix.  They were delicious!!  My mouth is still salivating and I may have licked the sauce off each finger in the most un-ladylike fashion, but I couldn't let any go to waste!  Among my friends, we tried the Ranch, Hot and Cajun flavors and everyone liked what they got.  The bartenders were friendly and made sure we knew right away of the specials, like when the Pens score, you get $2 off your next beer.  Not only is this is an amazing deal, but I appreciated that the bartender informed us of this, as she probably realized it was our first time visiting.   As for the atmosphere, there are a ton of TV's, which makes watching the game convenient from wherever you're seated.  The place was pretty big too - we had a table in the main area, but noticed a side room with some games and a back room with tables and pool table, maybe?  Also, (as a girl I feel the need to proclaim this in writing,) Stinky's bathrooms were about the nicest/cleanest I've ever seen in a bar!  The only small complaint is that it was a bit smoky, but I've learned to deal, and almost expect this, at most bars so it wasn't a deal breaker for me, at least.   If you're looking for a laid-back, no-frills type of bar to relax with your friends, I absolutely recommend this bar.  Off the beaten path of Butler Street, it's like a little hidden gem in Lawrenceville.  My friends and I can't wait to go back!",

Love coming here for the 60 cent wing deal! Their wings are some of the best that I've had in Pittsburgh. The awesome sauce is my favorite, although I've never had a sauce that I didn't like here. I also really enjoyed their codfather fish sandwich - it was gigantic! I've also heard great things about their burgers but haven't gotten around to trying them yet.   Definitely a great place to stop in for some cheap food and beer!",

The restaurant area was very nice and completely separate from the bar so it's very kid-friendly back there. My kids had their pizza, which was great and my husband and I both had the hamburgers. I think it is extremely hard as an establishment when a certain food item (in this case their hamburgers) have been on \"Best of\" lists and/or have won awards because you often have high hopes for these places. Our hamburgers where perfectly fine and tasted good. They just weren't a \"Wow, no wonder these burgers are on the best burgers in the US list.\" We didn't find anything extraordinary about them honestly so I was slightly let down some. Parking, of course, is ridiculous in Lawrenceville but this place had a small parking lot in the back. So get there early for dinner and you should be okay.",

    "text": "There's just something about Stinky's.  We have lived here over 3 years and just stumbled across Stinky's last month.  Not literally.  We drove there.  On purpose.  And yes, we have been back at least once a week every week since then.  Stinky's has that kind of allure.  Stinky's is one of those rare contradictions that seems to work out: a sports bar with a separate dining room, to please different kinds of patrons.  A smoking bar that's very clean.  A divey-feeling place that isn't a dive at all.  It's just a really great, all-around neighborhood bar.  During Pens season, you get sixty-cent wings and $1 off your drink every time the Pens score a goal.  There are weekly drink specials, too, but nothing that's blown me away.  The happy hour is on the early side (4:00-6:00), so we have not been able to check it out.  The tap selection is modest, but they always have one good IPA on tap -- and that makes this poster a happy girl.  What do I like most about Stinky's?  The Codfather.  No joke, that is one delicious fried cod sandwich.  Am I obsessed with fried fish sandwiches?  Yes I am.  And Stinky's does not disappoint.  The service has always been friendly and fairly prompt.  Lots of TVs in both rooms of the bar for watching the Bucs win.  I hear there's karaoke on Friday nights, which we just might need to check out.  A great convivial atmosphere when the game is on -- you can just jump right in and cheer your heart out, and everyone at Stinky's understands.",

I came here with my boyfriend on a weeknight, and we took advantage of the cheap beer prices and sixty-cent wings during the game. We also each ordered burgers...don't judge! I got the southwest burger, and it was wonderful. The toppings were evenly balanced, and the whole thing was very big. It came with a pile of glorious crispy fries.   The general atmosphere was casual and the entire establishment was very clean...our table didn't have that greasy residue some bar tables can get. Our waitress was so sweet and handled everything perfectly. She was attentive but not overbearing. I also love how she used our first names. It was so friendly of her, and I really appreciated it. Overall this is a place I can really see myself becoming a regular at. Especially during playoff season!",

They are awesome, obviously not frozen, on amazing bread, with fresh veggies always.  The staff is super friendly, they always remember me (maybe I come here too much).  Food specials include Tacos and wings, on certain days.   There are 4 massive rooms, so you can go with your fam and chill in the back, or hang out at the bar and smoke and drink.  There are outlets everywhere, and free wifi.  My boyfriend and I like to finish up work here during the week while having dinner, and not feel like a bunch of weirdos.

Food is your regular American fare. Burgers fries and chips. All stars for their Codmother(Codfather is the bigger version of Codmother)! It is Cod filet beer battered deep fried served on a bun with pickles and their signature coleslaw. My B got this and he liked it.      I got the grilled chicken salad and it was a generous portion. And I got the raspberry vinaigrette. It is sort of mediocre. But what sold me out is their Stinky chips! I loved it. It's a basket of fresh cut, deep fried seasoned potato chips and it was good with the ranch dressing. It comes at a good price too of$5.99 a basket.       Our server was very nice and helpful, regularly checking on us. Her name is Jessie. Like this place, very laid back and loved by regulars frequenting the place. Will definitely come back when in town.       The women's restroom was very clean and smelled clean!",

It's smoker friendly in the bar area, but has a closed off non-smoking section for those who are bothered by that sort of thing.  The ventilation is good and the ceilings are high enough that you don't notice the smoke unless the person is sitting RIGHT next to you.    I've never had any food from here that I didn't like.  They have a huge menu of sandwiches, wings, and other typical bar food.  The wings are always crisp and perfectly cooked.  The popcorn shrimp basket is one of my favorite go-to items.

Be sure to ask the waitress the one you are eyeing on has special deal. I think steak quesadilla was participating in the specials.  We got the stuffed jalapeno, nachos, fried pickle and fried ravioli. They were all good, I can't complain at all for $5. They have a lot of beer selections and pretty much everything on the menu.

We sat at the bar for a while and then moved to a table when our group expanded. I mainly tried all appetizers, as many of them were discounted with the happy hour special, and I was NOT disappointed.   Fried Zucchini- Delicious. Obviously homemade, lots of flavor.  Fried Pickles- Again, clearly homemade. The spicy ranch really complimented them. So tasty.  Buffalo Chicken Dip- YUM. The pita chips served with them were OUT of this world. Drooling thinking about them.  Fried mozzarella- By far the BEST I've ever had. They were incredibly juicy, fresh, and HUGE. I could not get over how delicious they were.  Mac & Cheese balls- Again, homemade. Huge. Delicious.   See a pattern here? Everything was homemade, and everything was incredible. I was really blown away and can't wait to come back here again!",

    "text": "Absolute worst karaoke night I've ever seen.  The show starts at 9:30 and the KJ expresses gratitude for showing up in the beginning of the night by stuffing every new singer in front of you.  We arrived at 9:30 and I was the first singer of the night.  Any other karaoke DJ in town will pepper a few new singers into every rotation to ensure that the early arrivals are rewarded through second or third rotations.  Not this one.  I sang at around 10:05pm, and didn't see my second song until 12:10am.    If you come to Stinkys for karaoke, I want you to know that no other KJ in town does this, and there are better KJs in town with a better selection, better attitude, who does a better job.  Check out anywhere else.  Message me for recommendations of better shows in town, and I'll point you in the right direction.",

    "text": "Was pleasantly surprised by this place, the outer appearance and the name don't necessarily lead someone to think food here will be delicious and it will be a welcoming environment.  We sat in the side area of the bar.  Service was a bit slow, but the bar was very busy and the bartender was working our table as well.  My husband tried the sausage stuffed jalapenos and I had the fried ravioli.  The amount you get in an appetizer in my opinion was more than usual, which was very nice.  My husband liked the jalapenos but wished there was more sausage and would probably try something different next time.  The fried ravioli was delicious and their marinara sauce is good too.  We both went with burgers for dinner, he had the jalapeno cream cheeseburger and I had the real whopper.  Both burgers were very good, the flat top gives a nice crunch to the meat.  And both burgers are huge!  We look forward to coming back, might be our new go to place for good bar food.",

We weren't planning on staying very long but as we settled in we decided to just watch the entire game here.  They have a separate dining and bar area.  The bar area is large and the big U shaped bar is perfect for gathering with friends.  They also have TV's that surround the bar so no matter where you are sitting you don't need to turn your head to see the TV, there is always one right in front of you.  They offer a limited selection on draft, about twelve or so. There is a nice selection of styles from IPA's to ciders, Ales, Shandys and some domestics.  They also have a cooler that offers up more variety.  The bar is clean and so are their restrooms which is definitely appreciated.  The bar is a little too dark for my liking with no natural sunlight coming in, but at night I guess that wouldn't matter much.   I didn't try their food since I had just came from eating, but I will the next time I'm here.  The menu had many options, not just your standard bar fare, and at very reasonable prices.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying this, I had a very hard time deciding between 3 and 4 stars. However, I had to go with 3 stars and this is why. The bar had an astonishing amount of the smoke in the bar which made my experience uncomfortable. What made it even more uncomfortable is that I saw the male bartender place his hand near the rump of the female bartender, which she quickly declined. If we can change those two things this review easily jumps to the 4 and 5 star range. Hot wings were cooked perfectly and were scrumptious.  Beer was cold and affordable. Now on to the million dollar question, will I returning....I honestly do not think so BECAUSE of the smoke. Thank you for your time.",
