I've often gotten raw deep-fried onion products from other restaurants but this was cooked perfectly. The food great and the service was just as good. The only issue we encountered was the wait between when we ordered and when the food arrived. They were pretty busy so I'll assume it was due to a busy kitchen.",

My steak was prepared exactly to my request and every tender morsel was like a little party in my rejoicing mouth. Even the side dish of garlic mashed potatoes was amazing. The complimentary bread is best enjoyed with the honey butter. Don't be shy, slather it on there. I would have had a second meal for dessert if I had any room. I may have cried a little.

I sent the au jus back and asked to have it hotter and it came back barely hot, so after finding out the lobster tail was overcooked I didn't want to chance sending that back.  The prime rib was tough at a med. rare.  and not hot so that is why they should make sure the au jus is hot. We got there when they first opened so there shouldn't have been overcooked lobster.  We barely got any butter for the bread, so when the kids wanted more there was no more butter.  I don't know if they are going down hill but for what they charge there should be a much better experience.  Also our waiter was pretty much not around. Very disappointed in this visit, esp. for the cost.",

We sit at the bar, waiting at least 5-10 minutes, wasn't served or even approached! Multiple waiters walking around and I assume a manager because she sat at a small booth with a computer nothing being said. We stood up to walk out and the bartender said, \"Hello.\" We kindly said hi and started to approach the door. She said I'm sorry I was getting food. I've worked in the restaurant industry and if my bartender wasn't there, a server or manager would have approached the guests and got them at least water! But no, nothing said or even greeted.

My mom and brother didn't, but were upset because of the half-inch thick cut of meat that was NOT a filet, but perhaps a top sirloin.    After I sent mine back, the manager came over asking if everything was ok.  I said no, and told him that my companions were too polite, but that all three steaks were terrible, and NOT filet mignon.  He explained that the sad little cuts of meat were necessary because they wanted their steaks medium well. Wtf???  (That's rubbish, and doesn't explain the trash they tried to sell to me.)  So basically, his response was \"Suck it, that's the garbage we sell here.\"  I used to think Outback was a good value with decent food for the money. Well? Not anymore, or at least not this one.

My brother wanted his steak mid-rare, unfortunately, it was raw and had to be sent back. It was somewhat odd that they just re-fired the same steak which my brother had already completely cut it half.  Other than the service, the food was what you could expect from any Outback Steakhouse. Unfortunately, the quality of the service was poor which negatively impacted the overall experience.   My favorites from Outback is always the baked sweet potato. I normally avoid excessive amounts of butter/sugar if possible, but when it comes to the baked sweet potato, bring on the brown sugar, butter and cinnamon!",

I got a chicken breast cook just done.  I hate chicken unless it is overdone. The fries were not Aussie cheese and he forgot my dressing.  The upside is was they scraped the mushrooms off prior to bringing it out to me but they were on there at one point.",

    "text": "Such a shame I have to give this location a two-star rating, but I feel that I must. On Sunday I ate here with my parents and while yes, it was very busy, our service was among the worst I've ever had at any restaurant. My mom had put our name on the waitlist ahead of time using, I believe, Outback's app? Either way, we were put ahead of the line, and our wait still took almost 45 minutes when we were told it would be 25.   I know that's a thing that can change - it's no fault of the restaurant, really - but it was frustrating. The hostesses were clueless. We went back to return our buzzers and they tried to greet us again as if we hadn't been sitting across from them in the cramped waiting room for 45 minutes.   Onto the table. Our server was very much stretched thin and only came back to check on us once. I think he would've been fine on another other night, and it was obvious they were busy, but he wasn't the most attentive. Tables were left uncleaned for half hours at a time, and it just seemed to me that people in the front AND the back of the house were not doing what they were supposed to.   Onto the meal! While I did eat everything happily, and the quality was what I'd come to expect in my other visits here, I did mention to the manager that my medium steak was cold around the edges when it arrived, as well as gray around the edges (slightly overdone). Not a huge deal, but it greatly lessened the quality of that first bite of slight red I was hoping for (and had ordered). I have a feeling my meal was sitting up on the heated expo table for quite a while before it was run to our table.   Not to drag this out, but I thought they went to Australia to get our meat. I also ran into a mom and daughter in the bathroom, complaining about all the same things. \"They messed up my husband's steak and overcooked mine, too! They didn't bring us the right dessert,\" etc. The daughter was lamenting how much homework she still had to do that night. I feel ya, kid. I didn't want to spend 2.5 hours at Outback Steakhouse on my Sunday night either.   A general manager DID come to our table, and while she was very nice and applied a discount to our check, she seemed VERY surprised when I politely spoke up about our low quality service. If you're a manager and are completely clueless about how slow your food is coming out and how tables aren't being cleaned, then something else is going on. The back of the house was not up to par.   As if the service throughout the night wasn't enough, it took us nearly 20 minutes to get our check. Another waiter had to bring it to us because our server was busy splitting checks (really?). At that point I was ready to walk home. It may have been quicker!  A minor plus - during the long seating wait, a hostess brought us menus so we could give our order to the server once we sat down. That was about the only saving grace.   So, all in all, the food was great quality* (though not cooked to temperature), and the service was terrible. Visit at your own risk.",

I asked her which of the 4 Maragritas that were on the drink menu was the big seller, she shook her head and said she had no idea, I ordered the Moscow/Outback Mule, which was good, but after she took my drink order she filled up 5 other customers beers before making mine. The folks beside me said they had been waiting over 20 min to order, so when she returned to get their order I ordered the 6oz sirloin & lobster $15.99 special, comes with choice of 1 side, I ordered french onion soup for my side.  The soup was good, but 2 min after they gave me my soup my meal arrived. same with folks beside me, they didn't have time to finish their soup either. Tho the  food was tasty, when I asked for my bill, it took a while, (at this time the bar was 1/2 full)  I was billed for the $25.99 Fillet & Lobster meal, instead of $15.99 meal, I questioned the bartender, he took the receipt and laid it down and waited on others at the bar instead of tending to my issue. After some time,  I got the correct bill. I was there 1 hour 35 min, for a bar meal and 1 drink.  I also witnessed one of the bar tenders sweep up the floor at the end of bar, pick up the pile of dirt, and go about making drinks, ripping up mint , cutting fruit, etc without washing his hands after cleaning floor. I won't go back, unfriendly and poorly trained staff and bad sanitation practices.............",

I had one of the best steaks of my life at this outback about a year and a half ago.  It was tender, melt in your mouth, deliciousness.  Since that steak, I've still been a fan of their filet, but they can be a bit inconsistent.  My mother and I both ordered our steaks medium, yet hers came out of the kitchen practically still moo-ing while mine was well done.  All in all though, it's a good steak, at a good price, with good service.  The sides are really amazing here.  Get the sweet potato with all the toppings (butter, brown sugar, yumminess).  You won't regret it.  The wedge salad has HUGE chunks of blue cheese (hint:  save them for your steak!  you'll save a couple bucks and make a good steak even better!) and the combination of the creamy blue cheese dressing with balsamic vinegar drizzled on top is mouthwatering.    They can be PACKED on the weekends, so come with a good book.  I believe that they are going to start an online check in ahead service soon to cut down the wait, but not entirely sure about that.  With other steakhouses and restaurants opening just down the street it will be interesting to see how Outback continues to perform.  That being said, I know I will be back!",

Let's just say that we will never be back to this location and I'll have a hard time getting her back to one in general. We walked in and was greeted by a very polite male hostess. His brief service was the best thing about this trip. The first issue we had was the female manager was belittling the male hostess in front of multiple customers because a waitress asked to have 7 tables and he obliged. There are better ways to handle that situation and she showed poor management skills. Next issue. Waiter was terrible. We ordered waters and he immediately walked away. I had to call him back to order the blooming onion.  Side note: I don't eat onions but because this was my fiance's first time I thought it was only right to share it with her. After about 10min I had to ask for the brown bread. Usually that was the first thing you got as you sat down. The bread was nothing like I remember. Terrible. So far not looking good overall. The onion comes out and the 2 inner layers are golden brown as it should be then the rest of the onion is charcoal looking(picture below). Tasted exactly like charcoal. We didn't even eat half and pushed it to the end of the table. I ordered steak,asparagus,sweet potato. My fiance ordered pasta with grilled chicken(picture below). My meal was good except I literally got 5 half pieces of asparagus. Steak was cooked well (only positive). My fiance pasta dish was nothing special and lacked a lot of flavor. The chicken was burned on one side and rubbery. While the charcoaled blooming onion sits on the end of our table the manager walks by to do the \"table touching\" and as he is walking by, looks at the onion,says everything good? And before we even have time to respond he has already passed our table. Never stopped for a second. Management, the food, and overall service will keep us from ever going back here. We might try a different location but not for awhile. Thanks for disappointing Outback and how about putting management on the barbie'.",

    "text": "It depends...  If its busy, you are going to wait a looong time, and your steak will be cooked wrong:  Rare =  The Prom Scene from \"Carrie\" Medium Rare =  Still mooing Medium = Shoe leather Medium Well = Beef Jerky Well = I've never ordered well done, but I just assume they literally bring you a charcoal briquette on a plate.   If they're not busy, they do pretty good, and you can actually get a decent medium rare cook on your steak. They tend to cook on the well side, but that is the rule I think for all Outbacks.   Do's and Dont's:  *Don't get cheese on your veggies. It's disgusting. *Don't get \"Bloom Petals.\" This is just the stuff that falls off the other Bloomin' Onions that other people ordered. Just get the full Bloom, ya cheapskate!  *DO try the \"Steakhouse Philly.\" They use shredded rib-eye, and no sh*t, it is one of the best Philly's you will get outside of Philly. The secret is they top it off with the Mac n' Cheese rue.  *DO get one of the better cuts, like the NY Strip or Rib Eye. They will cook it better. *DO sit at the bar if there is space available. There's usually a game on the TV, the bartenders are attentive, and it's a nicer atmosphere than the regular dining area.",

We got seated and ordered our food pretty quickly. It was my mom and I and we shared an order of Bloom Petals which were really yummy. My mom ordered a bowl of wedding soup and I got the Crispy Chicken sandwich, it took a loooong time to get our food and the place was nearly empty. Our waitress was not the friendliness and when my mom asked about getting a coffee she basically told her that the coffee wasn't fresh and that it was dark roast so it wasn't good anyways. My mom also inquired about the crab cakes and the waitress told her that she didn't like them and that the restaurant down the road had better ones... ummm okay... not to mention it was 100 degrees in there and I had to pull my hair up bc it was so hot. 30 minutes later our food came out and it was extremely hot and very good so I guess that redeemed them a little. I'd give a 2 for experience and 4 for food soooo 3 stars it is.",

We ordered 2 filet migon dinners, shrimp Barbie, side of asparagus, salad, salmon in bourbon sauce, topped with bacon (bacon, really?) Chicken dinner.  Each dinner was terrible! The salad was a joke-brown hard iceberg chunks, 2 cherry tomatoes cut in half, I think the salad dressing was on the bottom?  Filets-we ordered medium and medium rare; both were over cooked, hard, too spicy, couldn't cut with a steak knife. No flavor, no color.  Shrimp Barbie-very small bowl with 4 even smaller shrimp (1/2 pieces) rubbery.  Salmon with sauce-undercooked, teaspoon of sauce (horrible) and one half strip of rubbery bacon. I had ordered coconut shrimp; it was forgotten. Served later and cold,  Asparagus-all were stems and woody. Couldn't cut or eat.  Mashed potatoes-out of mashed potatoes?? At 5:30?? Gave us French fries; cold and undercooked.  Baked potato-hard pieces, no butter, teaspoon of sour cream, and cold. Chicken-impossible to cut. We said something to the manager about the bacon, and didn't want to say too much about our meals, because other customers were coming in. The manager said he would say something to the kitchen, never saw him again. The meals were expensive, and this was a good restaurant; what happened? Now with all the competition, they have to do better. Definitely will not be returning.",

When we got there, there was no wait, which should have been a red flag for us. Our server came over a couple minutes after we sat down and she was SO LOUD. We ordered our drinks, a blooming onion, and my sons food (chicken fingers). She came back to take our order and my husband ordered ribs with a steak and side salad. I don't eat beef but I wanted a Aussie sandwich which comes with beef but I have got it previously with chicken. I asked her for this and our server said \" ummmm I don't think we can do that\" \"what else would you want\"... I replied with \" that's weird because I have got it before?, can you ask them if it's possible?\" And she said well why don't you just pick something else and I'll go ask. She left for 15 mins and finally came back and said \"oh they said just sub out beef for chicken\"... I wanted to say \"I could have told you that\" because I was a server and know it's not that hard. But then I said well I wanted to sub our fries for Mac and cheese and she rolled her eyes at me. Like? It's not my fault that you said you were coming back to tell me if I could get it but never did and what if I didn't want everything on my sandwich? She left the blooming onion and my husbands side salad. The salad my husband couldn't eat because he said the ranch tasted weird and the blooming onion was all floppy. After that we didn't see her for almost an HOUR , she never checked on any tables by us, must have just been sitting in the back. If something is wrong, you should come out and update the table. NOPE! We sat there, no drink refills. I finally went up to the hostess to ask if something was wrong and she said she'd go get our server. A manager came to our table and said \"hey I'm Mike I don't work at this location but another one and I'm here trying to retrain and get more workers\"...... sooo basically no one is working in the back and the servers need retrained obviously because they are rude. I told him about my husbands salad and he said \"oh well there is a problem with the ranch a person in the back made it wrong and we thought it was all thrown out\" . Our food came  and we had to leave because my son didn't want to sit there any long . The manager replaced my husbands salad with soup and gave us free dessert. We saw our server hours later finally to come give us our check. We will NEVERRRR go back there!",

Brad, our great server brought us our blooming onion and stated that \"We don't feel that this is up to the best quality & we will be bringing you another one shortly. We wanted to make sure you had something to we in the meantime.\" We were thoroughly impressed with this. Everything that we ordered was prepared exceptionally.

    "text": "Disappointing, to say the least. After doing call ahead seating at 7:30 on a Saturday night, we were not seated for nearly half an hour even though the left dining room was completely empty.   The food quality was fine, with the exception of the celery that accompanied our appetizer of wings. The celery was old and wilted and at least two pieces were soft and brown.  Service was slow, but our server was a nice enough guy. He didn't seem too familiar with the menu, though, so he might have been newer.  Regardless, when my mother's steak salad came out with the wrong temperature of steak on it, we sent it back. We then proceeded to wait for a very long time for a new, medium rare, piece of meat. Her salad was nearly 3/4 eaten by the time the new steak arrived.  When we spoke to the manager (whom we later found out is the proprietor of this location), she merely made excuses for being seated so late and continued to argue with my mother about this matter. At least she did agree that sitting among a table full of dirty appetizer/salad/soup dishes for the duration of our meal was unacceptable.   Nowhere during this conversation did she ask how she could make the situation right or really attempt to apologize for our poor experience. I had enough of the excuse-making and reminded her that we came to the restaurant at prime time on a weekend night, when staff should have been at full capacity and ready for the dinner rush. I also told her that we wouldn't be back. She didn't have much to say after that. But she did come back ten minutes later with adjustments made to our checks and two ten dollar gift cards for my parents. We still won't be back.  This was our final chance for this location. We had an even worse experience when I took my husband here for his birthday in March.  Full disclosure: I worked at this Outback probably 13 years ago. My Saturday nights were far busier, with at least 3 deep at the bar, and with far fewer table visits made by management. The food was always top quality and made fresh daily, and we servers took a lot of pride in making our customers happy. If a customer did have a bad experience, we went above and beyond to make it right. It seems like Outback has become just another mediocre restaurant among a sea of mediocre chains. If you're still looking for the old \"No Rules, Just Right\" philosophy, keep looking. You'll certainly not find it at the North Hills Outback.",

Waitress came over and said she would be with us in a minute. She came back and took drink orders and brought hot bread. I ordered a 9oz sirloin with a salad and a baked potato and a french onion soup. The french onion soup and salad were good and the steak was cooked just right. The waitress was very friendly and service was very good. I would go back to this location again and would recommend it to others.",

    "text": "We came in last Friday night (09/21/18) at about 7:30 pm, and this place hardly had any customers. This was definitely a red flag, especially at dinner time on a Friday night, but we went in and gave it a chance anyway.   We were greeted by a hostess who said \"I'll have to go wipe a table\" and sighed. She wiped the table and came back to seat us. Every employee in there looked miserable and the hostess definitely seemed to be annoyed that she even had to greet a customer. This is really not welcoming and a huge turn off. Not to mention the seats at our booth were greasy, there were crumbs and food all over the floor, and we waited for a while with no server stopping by. We decided it was time to leave rather than dine in such a terrible environment. As we were leaving, we tried to find the hostess to let her know we would be leaving, but she was nowhere to be found. While I was out front waiting for my boyfriend to pull the car up because it was pouring down rain, the hostess walked out, glared at me, mumbled something, and then proceeded to walk right up behind me and follow me halfway to the car. It was pretty uncalled for.  Needless to say we will not be attempting to dine here ever again. Which is a shame because we loved the Outback where we used to live and have never had an experience this horrible in any location but this one. From the looks of other reviews, everyone else has had bad experiences here too.",

There was a wait but the hostess was sweet and bubbly and it went quickly. Our server Ryan was fantastic, he gets five stars  . I wish I could say the same for the food. I feel as thought the blooming onions get smaller every time I go. He ordered The Great Barrier Reef Combo special with lobster  tail shrimp  skewers and crab  cakes. I ordered a 6oz center cut medium rare sirloin with mashed potatoes and broccoli  . We got some really good shrimp and lobster but some severely burnt crab cake hockey pucks. I got a definitely well done not center cut steak and cold potatoes, at least the broccoli was good. Ryan was fantastic and got me a new steak , that was still moo-ing  very rare (not the medium rare I asked for) and even after being put back on the grille was to red in the center. Overall this was a total waste of a gift card and reminded me why we don't eat at Outback.",

    "text": "I QUIT THIS CHAIN A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO...WHY DID I GO BACK!  Times quoted were accurate and not guessed.  A couple of years ago when I was working in the Toledo Ohio area, I stayed in the town of Maumee at a Courtyard.  Right next to it was an Outback.  I wrote a couple of not so good reviews and swore off Outback forever.  My wife and I went back yesterday to an Outback in McCandles Pa. WHAT A MISTAKE!  This restaurant made the one In Maumee look like the best Restaurant in the chain.  1.  Call ahead seating.  What a joke. We called and were told that if we were there in 10 to 15 minutes we would be seated promptly.  We arrived in 10 minutes only to be told it would be 25 to 30 minutes.  45 minutes and we were still waiting. 2.  Finally we were seated and the hostess that sat us dropped the menus on the table like we and the menus had no worth.  35 minutes later a waitress came to the table. 3.  My wife ordered the 12 oz Prime rib.  When it was served, it was a ribeye.  When we questioned her, she said that they were out of the 12 oz Prime rib. I asked, do you just substitute without asking when you run out of something.  I just got a blank stare. My wife's  baked potato was not done and it was lumpy and hard. 3.  We had to ask for their normally delicious warm brown bread.  After quite a while we were presented an unheated loaf.  You can imagine what it tasted like. 4.  Not for me.  I ordered the bone-in Ribeye, which is their specialty.  Since we live near Pittsburgh I asked for it to be done \"Pittsburgh Medium\".  This means charred somewhat on the outside and medium inside.  It came out Pittsburgh raw. I stopped the manager at this point and he said he will cook it himself...raw again. He did offer me a glass of wine, but the meal was a disaster. We paid full price but were given a couple of small gift cards. That was a too little, too late as where would I use them?...As I don't plan to go back.",

    "text": "I tried to give outback one last chance. I haven't been in a few years and my fiance and I are doing the Whole30 program and we heard there were approved foods we could eat with some modifications (such as just salt and pepper as seasoning, no dressing or cheese). We arrived and were seated promptly, but waited and waited for someone to show up in the section we were seated to ask for our drink order. I have 15 years experience working part time in the industry from age 14-28- so I had a bad feeling from the beginning. Tables should be greeted within 2 minutes as industry standard.  Then, it took another 7 minutes for our drinks to be delivered. After that, Victoria took our order. It took another 8-10 minutes for bread to arrive for my daughter. During these wait times, she was no where to be found. I could understand if she was hustling other tables or something but it was not that busy and again she was absent from all her tables. Not once did a manager recognize this or step in. I heard multiple tables around me complaining about the wait times and in fact I watched another table across from us be ignored for 15 minutes then when they received their drinks, she disappeared again. I then watched them get up and explain to other tables why they were leaving, we all agreed. Again, no manager in sight. Now I see this location seems to have terrible reviews on yelp. With proper management, this should never happen. I 100% blame the general management team here. The women's bathroom had toilet roll holders ripped off the wall and missing completely or unfilled roll holders with toilet paper sitting on the back of the toilet. Seems to be a case of laziness and \"I don't cares\" going on here. Outback probably won't be around much longer at this rate. That bagged lettuce was disgusting on my salad and tasted like preservatives. The burger my fiance had was a tiny thin patty. For over $50 we could've made a way better meal at home and actually left full.",

    "text": "Before I get into this review let me set the stage for you. I wanted a Steak for my birthday dinner. Texas Roadhouse was closed due to a water main break and Outback was the next closest Steak restaurant.   Now I will begin:  Went here for my birthday dinner with 2 of my fellow co-workers. I had a feeling the minute that we sat down that we were in for a rude awakening. My coworker was having a hard time deciding on an alcoholic beverage and instead of the waitress helping him she decided strip this man down to his core and shatter any confidence that he had left. Fast-forward to the appetizers, the bread and my salad was pleasant the best part of the meal by far. For my main course I ordered the bone in ribeye (cooked medium) because I love flavor. When my steak finally comes out they bring me a porter house, I send it back because I believe in justice. Then after 20 minutes my ribeye finally comes out, I take a couple bites of the crispy outside of the steak and think this is pretty good, then I get into the middle and the steak is redder than red. I immediately tell the waitress and send the steak back because again I believe in justice. Wait another 15 minutes, when the steak finally arrives it is flavorless and taste like taste-less beef jerky. At this point I am fed up and I ask for the check and depart from the premise. Will I be returning you ask? No not in a million years, even if I was given free food from them for the rest of my life I would never go back, and I am writing this review to save others from the traumatic experience that I endured.",
