I would definitely recommend this over standard chain restaurant fare. Their french toast with challah bread was better than any I have had in recent years. The bread was rather large yet light with the right amount of egg and cinnamon. Also, their home fries were good but the portion size for a side order is ginormous--you are better off sharing it. The service was good and I'm looking forward to going there again the next time we are in town.",

They served it cold with a lovely garnish of fresh tomato, cucumber, feta, and kalamata. My husband had a turkey club with cole slaw and potato salad - all home made and delicious. The portions are humongous and can easily serve two people, maybe three if you order the pasta. The only thing keeping me from giving Central five stars was the overwhelming noise. Big open room + high hard ceilings = too much noise to even hear the people at your own table.",

    "text": "Had a great deal of time to kill between dropping off my fiancee at the airport and an early afternoon meeting. I'm less familiar with the options on this end of town, but Central Diner was open and came recommended.   I wasn't overly impressed, but that's likely in part because I didn't get very adventurous in my selection. My omelet was good as expected; others have commented on the potatoes being bland. I didn't think they were bland, they were simply unseasoned. I do agree that such an adjustment would add some zest to them. My only (minor) complaint is that the bacon -- while good -- was greasier than you'd expect.   That said, the food was good, and it's a lot of food for the money. Even the side of bacon that I ordered was about double the size of what I typically expect. Some folks have commented on the coffee here. It isn't bad, but it's pretty standard.   Overall, nice atmosphere, attentive staff, good food, and they didn't mind that I lingered around to get some work done in advance of my meeting. I would absolutely return, though I would likely go for a special next time to get a better sense of what they can do here.",

A place this fancy-looking inside should not give me a handful of individual packets of Smucker's syrup. Come on guys, let's get some warm syrup in a carafe, please! Our waitress was friendly and helpful, although she did not match the atmosphere, so to speak...seemed like maybe she had worked at the Denny's that was there before.

My husband ordered the two eggs & bacon, with very generous servings of bacon. My one complaint would be the lack of freshly squeezed juices.

I don't eat breakfast so I just had a coffee and eat my moms toast. Which was lovely rye toast.   But I note and write a review cause the staff were awesome! Very tentive and kept coming back to fill our coffees. Big mistake cause we made a long drive after!   Everyone was friendly!",

I had the Belgian waffle and Chris had the Nova Scotia eggs Benedict (smoked salmon). He really enjoyed the Benny and the waffle was great as well. Once we got a seat the service was fast and very friendly and our food arrived quickly.  I noticed that everyone here really works their butts off. They are all constantly cleaning, clearing tables, and moving very quickly. I was impressed. They also seem to work really well together as a team. All in all very impressed! We would return for sure.  A quick note though, this is not the place to visit if you're hungover and sound sensitive lol. It is LOUD so keep that in mind!",

The selection of cake and baklava is also perfection at it's finest.  I've ordered the gyro sandwich and gyro plate - also worth noting are exceptionally good!

It was a lot less crowded this time, so you could tell the wait staff had more time on their hands to focus on their customers rather than running around playing catch-up like mad people.  This time I ordered a cheese omelet with their home fries and toast, coffee, and water.  Overall bill was $13.00 after tip, which felt a little stiff but all of the food items were darn good.  The one things I did want to point out was that the management staff on duty still was walking around helping keep drinks and coffee full for customers while checking in on people.  One, I like that the wait staff can count with that kind of support since nothing annoys me more than eating without a drink on hand.  And Two, you can tell they're not letting their guard down they really want to make it work here at their new location.  I left as a very full and happy customer, so they've earned that fourth star.  Is it five-star caliber?  Not yet, but I definitely hope to return.",

I want to start off by saying that the service was out of this world; our waitress (I cannot remember her name, maybe Heather?) was kind, attentive, quick, and conversational. Everything else was awful. They claim to be a diner and grill but they definitely do not have a good balance of items from each; the menu was massive in size and about 4 pages long. The French onion soup was decent but not as amazing as they claim. My Caesar salad was good but my friends both had burgers and they were extremely disappointed. The burgers were clearly frozen, not fresh as the menu claimed. Very greasy and hard to eat, they couldn't even finish them. It wasn't the worst place I've ever eaten at but I certainly won't be back.",

I am not kidding. Every time I have gone there this happens. I'm not sure why anyone would think any other human being should be berated for their entire work day, or why their customers should hear it too.

    "text": "Central Diner is my go-to restaurant if I'm out in Robinson area. Extensive menu with tons of interesting choices and breakfast is served all day. Some of my favorites include the gyro eggs Benedict and the monte cristo sandwich. They also have a creamy lemon chicken soup that is out of this world. Portions are gigantic: salad bowls as big as bathtubs, pancakes the size of the moon, and enough lamb shank to feed an entire pro hockey team. I always have leftovers to sustain me for a day or two.   I can't say I've ever had a bad meal here. Though I did order the lasagna once and, although it was as big as a garden shed and very cheesy and texturally good, I didn't enjoy their red sauce. I'm extremely picky with red sauce though. If you stick to the more traditional Greek specials, you can't go wrong.   Here's a tip: split a main course with a willing participant and save room for cake. There's an assortment to choose from. I've only ever had the lemon, but it was some of the best cake I've ever tasted. Of course the cake slices are as big as an encyclopedia, so it'll last you all week.",

Everything about this restaurant is just so fresh and inviting and perfectly thought through. The decor is very modern yet not pretentious and says \"Everyone is welcome here\". The menu is exactly what I want in a Greek diner, as it has all the classics, but it also features interesting updates to the classics for those who want to try something new. For example, their burger menu is a great example of their philosophy as you can get a perfectly good diner burger for about $7 that comes with fries, or for a couple bucks more, you can opt for one of their fancier options like the Greek burger with feta. This is the kind of place that I wish was down the street from me so I could become a regular and try everything on the menu.",

As I sat down, I was reminded of a resort or cruise ship buffet. The tables and booths appeared rather new and they had light elevator music playing. I found the music to be an interesting choice for a diner, which is probably what gave it the cruise ship feel.   Anyway, I got the two eggs, over-easy, and the husband got the central chicken sandwich. I was pretty disappointed with my meal, which I couldn't understand how a diner could mess up such a breakfast essential. My eggs came with the yolk already broken. My home fries were basically smashed potatoes: no char or crispiness. And the \"toast\" wasn't even toasted! Extremely disappointing. The chicken sandwich was simple, but enjoyable according to the hubby.   Our service was ok: not incredibly friendly but not exactly rude either. I wasn't a huge fan of Central Diner but I'd be willing to give it another go. I'm convinced I came here on an off day!",

She ordered a sirloin which was huge and I ordered a chicken wrap ( also huge)  Today I brought my sister who also hadn't been here. She ordered the wrap, I ordered the Cobb Salad- grilled chicken, bacon, tomatoes, hard boiled egg, swiss cheese on a bed of chopped lettuce (delicious, fresh & huge salad) my niece ordered the kids spaghetti. She enjoyed it. Kids meals also cone with pudding, jello or ice cream as a treat.   They seem to have a few bottled beers now (Stella!!!) And some wine. There is patio seating as well as a counter...not to mention booths and tables   Everyday there is large list of specials. Today's for example were lasagna, stuffed pepper, Shepard's pie ect. I saw someone's lasagna plate.... Enormous!!!!    Central Diner is awesome. If you've never been, you're missing out!",

I'd get a refill on my drink before I'd set my finished beverage down on the table. He was knowledgable and very friendly. The food was delicious and fresh. The second time I went, the food was still great, but we had a different server and the experience wasn't as good as the first, but I'd still give the place 5 stars... until our third time. Had this been my first experience, I definitely would be giving a very low rating... we had this waitress who made us nervous. She wasn't friendly AT ALL. We asked about pricing for ordering a substitute side for a meal, and she said with an attitude \"I dont know but it'll be on your bill when we ring it up.\" WHAT??? The point of asking for price is to know BEFORE we order it, to see if it's worth the charge! Then, when my scrambled eggs came out, there was cracked eggshell in them. I pushed the shell bit to the side, and still attempted to eat them, but when our waitress finally came back to the table and asked us how everything was, I very kindly and with a smile, said \"everything is great, but just so you know, there were eggshells in my eggs.\" She gave me the dirtiest most annoyed look I've ever seen a waitress give and said \"well they're freshly cracked eggs, so you'll have that.\" And then gave me this condescending face and tone and also said \"but I'll be sure to run back there and tell them to be more careful.\"  Well, she received a very low tip from both of us that day. I felt bad because I'm usually a great tipper... when I have great service. If I ever decide to return to this restaurant, I'll be sure to say I dont want the waitress with the huge eggplant tattoo on her arm.",

We were seated in the closed in heated patio area which was just fine with me since there was only a few tables and so noisy. They have a large selection of food and the giant cakes in our display case looked really good. We ordered the buffalo wings which I just knew was going to be some version of frozen wings but to my surprise th ey were freshly fried and and tossed in sauce. The onion soup was yummy. I ordered one of the dozen specials, pastitsio, a greek version of lasagna but with ground lamb and bechamel sauce. It was huge! And delicious! My hubby ordered the fried fish sub which was fresh and the fish was bigger than the sub roll. My son got the philly cheesesteak which was decent! We got dessert to go because the cakes looked amazing. They were good but not amazing as they looked though. We went back the next morning for breakfast and our meals were delicious.

The night we went the temperatures were too high for sitting out doors.  At the entrance a dessert case features Hugh, Tall, beautiful looking cakes.  Serious attention getters to make planning how much you eat a consideration.  Each of us ordered something different, the lasagna was the daily special, stuffed pepper, chef salad, and spinach pie.  The lasagna is not on the Menu and is only as a daily special.  The chef salad is enormous.  Seriously three people could eat this.  Pinwheels of turkey and roast beef and cheese.  The dressing comes on the side.  The spinach pie is quite a large piece and tasty.  Three of us had the house salads.  The waitress said they are made fresh.  That may be True, but the shredded red cabbage was dried and brown on the edges.  One of us had the French onion soup and was graded very good.  The service was good on friendliness and taking orders.  Slow on clearing plates between courses.  We ordered cake for dessert to share.  Although a beautiful presentation the cake textures of coconut cream filled and coconut lemon filled cakes were dense and dry.  The icing though not overly sweet was hard.  Central diner offer many choices, and the serving sizes are jumbo sized.  Plan on taking part of your meal home or sharing.  The food is good.  My reasons for less than four stars is the salad, cakes and table clearing.",

We came here today, and all I can say is, I wish we had tried it sooner!  It was around four pm so there was no wait for a table. The building was an old Denny's, but it has been turned into a classy and comfortable restaurant. The menu is diverse. Lots of Greek food. Also, breakfast all day!   Sandwiches, hamburgers, salads, soups, full entrees from (I think) 4 - 9 pm ( I should have written this while we were still there, but I was too busy enjoying my meal!), desserts (oh, the desserts!) and alcoholic beverages, if you wish. They had a nice sized kids menu. Another review referred to this place as an upscale Eat n Park. That sort of fits, but I haven't been happy with E nP lately, halfway through my meal I wanted to do a happy dance!  It was fantastic. Plus, NO digestive issues!  I had the Spanakopita. If you like Spanakopita, you have to try it here. It. Is. Heaven!!!  My husband had the lamb, which he loved. The salad that came with it was huge. Not your typical \"side\" salad. He got it as a Greek salad and the feta cheese was excellent. We got dessert to go. No room right after dinner, and it looks like I will get at least two servings out of one dessert. The portions are large and, for me, that's great. I love left-overs!  The service was great. Everyone was friendly. It was clean. We will definitely be back. There are lots of good things on the menu that I HAVE to try!  Oh, when the weather is nice they have outdoor dining. Something to look forward to experiencing this summer.",

We have been here a few times since, and each time, we always try something different.  I have to say, that this place is fantastic!  The menu is so diverse for many different tastes.  In the four times we've been there, we are never disappointed.  The food is great, the portions are huge, and the service is friendly and inviting.  The owners certainly lead by example and are very involved in the business, which is a rarity to see, owners hosting, running food, cashiering, and taking orders.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about we're the fried pickles....the breading fell off and not a big fan of the fried Spears...I prefer pickle chips.  But I had the chicken salad was something of wonderful...I love chicken salad, and this was really tasty.  Big chunks of chicken, absolutely wonderful....we will be back time and time again...this place is always hopping...never not busy.  Definitely a must try when in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "I came here on a Wednesday for lunch due to a recommendation by a friend. He said it was a good spot for food and family owned which is why he liked it. Upon entering the establishment there was a chalkboard full of specials which we only had a few seconds to look at since we were promptly seated. The restaurant was packed full and rather noisy but that gave it even more of a family feel IMO.   The menu was pretty big for a diner and was packed full of good choices. When I went to wash my hands after being seated I walked past everyone's table glancing at all the food since it was my first time there. Every single dish I walked past looked amazing! When I returned to my seat I decided on going with the one special I remembered, the shepherds pie. I have never had a shepherds pie (I know I know...) so after googling it I dove in head first.   My meal came with a cup of soup, I chose chicken noodle. It was very good but the vegetable beef is what I should have gone for. When my shepherds pie arrived I started chowing down. It was pretty good but not amazing, but considering it was my first shepherds pie it could have been the best shepherds pie in the world and I wouldn't know. I felt that if the broccoli was replaced with peas it would have been better. Anyways... the shepherds pie is the only thing that kept this place from getting 5 stars. I will surely be returning to try other items since the other food looked so amazing, everything was home made and the prices were very reasonable. Oh yea, and when I was leaving I saw 20 different cakes in the display case that were over a foot tall! I will return for the cake alone!  I am looking forward to returning and hopefully updating my review to 5 stars once I eat something I am more familiar with!",

    "text": "As I've reviewed more restaurants, I've found that my standards have become increasingly exacting, and that I award fewer 5 star reviews.  Despite this, Central Diner and Grille impressed me sufficiently that I feel justified in awarding this rating.  It's hands down the best diner I've ever been to, by far.  As a city dweller, I rarely make it all the way out to Robinson.  When a Yelp event at a nearby business led me and CM there this weekend, I suggested that we check it out for dinner beforehand.  I described it to him as an upscale diner, but this doesn't really do it justice--it's more of a casual dining-type place that happens to offer breakfast foods all day long, and to be open late.  Also True to the diner name, it offers a variety of desserts, as well as Greek foods, given that the owners, like the owners of many East Coast diners, are Greek.  However, its staple foods are classic American dishes, and they have enough of a variety to satisfy many different tastes.  In light of the specialization in Greek food, I decided to order the Chicken Athena ($16.95), a Greek-influenced chicken dish, and CM decided to order a gyro ($8.95).  In addition to its eponymous dish, my meal came with a choice of soup or salad and side dish, as well as bread.  In keeping with the Greek theme, I decided to try the soup of the day, avgolemono, a Greek lemon-chicken soup.  I'd never tried this soup before, but it was very flavorful, and had a nice thickness.  The bread was a step up from what you'd expect at a casual dining establishment--it was fresh and had a nice body.  For my side dish, I went with the mashed potatoes, which were pretty standard.  As for the Chicken Athena, the first thing that was immediately apparent was its size--it was served on a platter larger than the placemat in front of me, and consisted of two large breasts topped with half a bag of spinach, as well as a generous helping of tomatoes and feta.  Wow!  The taste was on point, too--the freshness of the ingredients was quite evident.  I ate half of it and took the other half home, which I ate for dinner the next day.  CM's gyro was also massive, and came with a generous helping of fries, which were of the lightly battered variety.  He really enjoyed it, saying that it was almost as good as the one he'd had at the PGH Greek Food Fest, which is high praise.  His only minor criticism was that he wished it came with more tzatziki sauce, since he enjoyed its flavor so much that he wanted more!  (We probably could have asked for extra, but it didn't occur to us.)  Although the food was quite good, what earns Central a full 5 stars from me is its atmosphere and service.  In PGH--at least, in the city, al fresco dining is hard to come by, and Central has as many outdoor tables as they do indoor ones.  Since the weather was nice, we were able to take advantage of it, and it was awesome.  As a diner, Central is a family friendly restaurant, and several families with kids opted for the outdoor seating, which gave the kids an opportunity to blow off some steam.  Nevertheless, between the nice weather, the music, and the patio furniture, the atmosphere was comparable to some of the better restaurants I've been to in PGH.  The service was also impressive--our waitress came back to our table to offer me gravy for my mashed potatoes after overhearing me mention that I'd like some to CM, and the owner stopped by to ask me how everything was, and even offered to fill my water glass after we'd asked for the check.  It was clear that this is an extremely well-run, customer-focused restaurant.  CM and I enjoyed our time at Central so much that we returned after attending our event to enjoy dessert and after-dinner drinks on the porch while watching the sun set.  I ordered the death-by-chocolate cake ($4.95), and he ordered a hot chocolate with whipped cream ($1.85).  Although the waitress described the cake as all chocolate, this wasn't quite True, since the cake itself was yellow--it had chocolate icing and was drizzled with chocolate syrup.  Nevertheless, it was quite tasty, and the icing was high quality (CM compared it to his grandmother's).  CM enjoyed his hot chocolate so much that he used a spoon to sip it to make it last longer.  Overall, we were extremely pleased with our meal(s) at Central.  I'd love to return sometime for breakfast, which I'm sure is just as good as--if not better than--dinner, or for another dessert.  I'm positive Central would be a huge hit with my parents, who are picky eaters, or with children.  If you happen to be in Robinson and are tired of mediocre chain restaurant dining, or are on the hunt for a great diner, be sure to check this place out--you won't be disappointed!",

Good food, attentive server, hot host (okay, so I looked...heck, he's cute:) On the real though, I only had breakfast and it's kind of hard to mess that up but there were a lot of good looking dishes I witnessed being delivered to my fellow patrons and they seemed pleased. Our meals were the 2 egg special that comes with bacon, sausage or ham, home fries and your choice of bread.  See, that was easy but they did it well and everything was hot.  Not sure what brand of coffee they're serving up but I have never in my life drank more than 1 cup of coffee at any restaurant, ever.  At the Central Diner I had 4 cups.  LOL  Needless to say I was fully awake by the time we saw our featured movie in 3D up the street at Cinemark.    You've got to give them a shot.  It's different, like an upscale type of Denny's but with better food.     They have a big dessert display case that houses some decadent looking goodies that whisper \"You know you want me\" as you're standing in line waiting to pay...  Can't wait to listen to those little voices in my head and come back to try them out for dinner and dessert.",

The restaurant layout is like a Denny's, but in no way does it feel, look, or taste like one.  The interior is very clean, with the staff constantly cleaning the tables and floors. That's a plus!    The food was pretty tastey and portion sizes were superior.  I got the gyro plate and was amazed how big it was.  Bigger than most hole in the wall Greek places. Plenty if meat and fixings to fill the pita. Became messy, but I think that was due to the user's (me) inability to master eating a gyro gracefully. :) The side of cole slaw was very fresh, with a hint of sweetness to excite the taste buds. I also got a cup of wedding soup.  Tastes homemade, and therefore recommend getting it if you would like a hot bowl of soup.   Now to the best part... The dessert!  I wanted to get their German chocolate cake (due to the tastey pictures on yelp), but they were out.  So I opted for the carrot cake.  Omg mmmmm!  Very fresh and full of all the right ingredients that make a carrot cake full of flavor, moist in your mouth, and ultimately complete the meal.  I am eager to try the other cakes and expect them to be of the same enjoyment.   Finally, the staff are top notch.  Very friendly and aim to provide a very enjoyable eating experience.",

    "text": "I went to the Central Diner for the first time yesterday (Sunday, April 13th).  My mother was in town for her birthday, and we were between 2 places, and this is where she chose.    I was incredibly disappointed in the food.  I got a salad with chicken and ranch dressing on the side.  First - the salad set up is bizarre.  I chose the build your own salad, with spring mix with the addition of chicken.  The salad had no cheese, no veggies, nothing.  Just spring mix lettuce for $6!  Then an additional $5 for chicken.  The price of the additional chicken was reasonable.  But the fact that the lettuce - JUST lettuce was $6 - I found outragous!  It would have been more reasonable if the chicken was $6 (I think it's actually $5.95, but close enough!)  The chicken was - gross.  I haven't never eaten such terrible chicken at a restaurant.  It had freezer burn, with some pieces still frozen.  I told our waitress, who just kept saying \"It's good isn't it?\"  It was not.  It was FAR from good.  Sadly, I think I got a small touch of food poisoning from the 3 bites of food (Lettuce, chicken, and ranch dressing) I took.  Within 10 minutes of leaving - I was in the restroom 4 times in 30 minutes.  It was not pleasant.  I typically give places 2 chances - because sometimes your first stop isn't the best.  But I can't imagine giving this place another chance.  Be careful with what you order, just be aware.  Freezer burn chicken, lettuce that probably wasn't washed , just not good.",

Men and women from the service industry dressed in suits, ties, and other such formal attire dined alongside my loose band of rapscallion metalheads after a concert at Altar Bar. The manager could be see waiting on patrons sans a tie, indicating a hectic night handled with grace and class after 12am.   My insane friends decided it would be a good idea to go there for pie and milkshakes, braving a potential winterstorm.   The snow didn't start falling until well into the morning, but most of my friends had their pie and milkshakes...together.   You see, my friends had their pies (and in one case, cheesecake) blended into their milkshakes with no crosseyed looks. Their requests were accommodated famously by Alexander, our affable server.   When one pal went against the peer pressure and ordered a roast beef dinner, Alex asked, \"You want that in a milkshake too?\" The man had a sense of humor.   I too was an...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DnoZiEJgwQrc&s=75cee996d760c42690e94ac542c09c12a0b5ca3f2cbdf96adf93efa6470d623d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=noZi...</a>  No, I would order a mammoth of a gyro, one with meat as succulent and juicy as hamburger cooked medium-rare, a pita as fluffy as a sesame seed bun, and a tzatziki as creamy as a fresh mayonnaise.   The scratch-made mastery was also apparent in the dark fortress that was their brownie sundae. The brownies themselves were as dense as a candy bars and had a crisp tuille-ish exterior. Topping it were globes of golden vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, walnuts, Oreo scraps, and chocolate chips.   My hessian allies were awestruck at how I vanquished it all.   CD&G's mission is real. If an anti-chain revolt is to occur in Robinson, they will be leading the charge.",

Well lit, decorated nicely, etc. It can be very loud inside when it's crowded, but that's to be expected.   The service is good. The staff is friendly and so is the management. The managers seem to be very hands-on instead of simply watching everybody. They're always running somewhere to do something. Often times people who are not even serving my table will stop by to check on us. That's always a nice thing to see.   The food is average in my opinion. They do have a huge menu, so that's a plus. I've had a burger and it was a little on the greasy side. The fries are very good. Onion soup is great. Reuben sandwich was pretty decent. Like I said, the food isn't incredible but it's not gross either. I will definitely return, though. Overall I enjoyed my experience.",

There is very little to nitpick about  Central Diner & Grille.   The New York Strip steak I had has satisfying. It was definitely enough to fill you up. It was a bit thicker than usual and perhaps just a tad under a perfect medium rare, but good nonetheless. My mom had a very delicious ground beef stuffed pepper, which she claimed was one of the best she had ever eaten. The French onion soup I also had was just OK.

The service here is absolutely untouchable. I don't think I have had the level of customer service that they are providing here in QUITE a long time. It was a Saturday night - so it was very busy. Lobby was packed to the brim - always a good sign for me, as you KNOW its that good if people are lining up out the door. We only waited about 15 minutes for our table. The manager of this place is VERY involved.The hostess accidentally called our name for our table before it was ready. We had to wait again. Meanwhile, I watched the manager give orders around him to the various waiters and busboys -which by the way - were HUSTLING and working their butts off at this place. It was pretty refreshing to see. He led us personally to our table as the hostess has slipped the first go round. I was impressed.   Our waiter was fantastic. Very accommodating, polite, friendly. Couldn't have asked for a better experience. After talking to him after we had finished our meal he told us it was his first week working there. I was SO impressed. We would have never known. Whatever the owner is doing here - he is doing it RIGHT. His staff is well trained and treat people like real people, not like inconveniences.   We had the buffalo wings as an appetizer. OH MY GOD. Probably one of the best plates of wings I have had in a really long time. They were smoking hot, freshly cooked - no frozen chicken drumsticks here. They were breaded with cornflakes and SO crispy without being overly breaded. The sauce they were tossed in was just the right amount of spice but was full of flavor. You can tell it was homemade sauce, not a bottle of Franks red-hot with some butter melted into it.  We didn't even talk or look up at each other until the platter was empty. SO good.   Fiance had the monte cristo for an entree and I had the gyro sandwich. Both dishes came with homemade coleslaw, pickles and french fries. Fries were hot and crispy - not cold and soggy. The coleslaw was freshly made and on the sweeter side (a little too sweet for my taste, but still delicious!). The monte cristo was served on homemade challah bread french toast and had REAL roasted turkey and giant chunks of freshly carved salty ham. SO GOOD. The gyro sandwich I had was the best I have ever had. Ever. Ever. It had so much meat packed into the pita that I couldn't even finish it. The meat was fresh and flavorful and the tzatziki sauce was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I could tell it was freshly made that day, in house. I asked for extra, it was so good!   We will definitely be back again and again and again. Worth the drive no matter where you live in the city!",

Moreover, they've got an extensive list of Greek food you wouldn't find on a typical diner menu. Oh, and breakfast is great too.  My ONLY complaint about breakfast would be the home fries - they're nothing special and a bit mushy.   I love the Greek lasagna (can't spell it and it's a nightly special), open-faced gyro platter, steak, and even their wings are great.  My girlfriend especially loves the  salads.  Portions are very big too.   Their dessert menu consists of Greek delicacies and enormous pieces  of cake that taste great. 5 stars - I can't get enough of this place.

My Greek chicken panini was dried out tasteless chicken, a surprise since this place seems to get such good reviews.  The fries and cole slaw that came with are what you would expect.  We decided to give it a try for breakfast.  We were expecting a wait and the hostess said 10 to 12 minutes.  We were surprised by her estimate.  Well 45 minutes later we were called and seated.   The place is so noisy we had a hard time talking/hearing each other.  Our waitress leaned way over the table to talk with us.  Did I mention it is way to noisy/load.  Our waitress was good and provided refills. I had the blueberry pancakes.  The fresh blueberries were good, the pancakes were large but just OK not sure how to describe but just OK, not as good as a couple of other little diners we usually go to.  Also, a little more expensive.  Others had the french toast and bacon and were happy with their meal.  I did get a couple pieces of their bacon because they received so many pieces -- and the bacon was really good, thick and cooked perfectly.    Portions are large.  Service is good.

I loved how the inside actually gave off a diner feel. You can tell those who were working there loved their job and was proud of their restaurant.   The portions are HUGE. My grandma ordered the french toast, bacon and a cup of fruit. I ordered the pancake breakfast with bacon! It was delicious. I could not eat it all. I had to take the rest home to my grandpa :D He liked that!  Our server was somewhat attentive. She was busy, I will give her the benefit of the doubt, but for the most part this place was GREAT.  Stop by, you will not regret it!",

And kept pushing til they came in to seat someone else.  At the end we waiting forever for a to go order   And it was just overall a bad experience I'm hoping next time it will be back to better service",

I've not had a bad meal here yet. Lots of great options, and a lot of \"homemade\" options. I had lunch here with my boss yesterday. The French onion soup was very very good. Not the best I've ever had, but pretty close. I also had the fajita chicken wrap. Stuffed with chicken and grilled veggies. Excellent!! I took half of it home, I was stuffed. My boss had the special, stuffed green pepper over mashed taters. Homemade and tasty. I HIGHLY recommend Central. It's busy at times, but worth the wait.",

I needed to refuel my rental and found the diner near Sheetz. I was welcomed into the restaurant and sat at the bar whilst perusing the dessert menu. I decided to splurge a bit and ordered the brownie sundae. It was sweet, tasty, and chocolate delicious-ness! Lots of whipped cream, ice cream, nuts, and (DUH) chocolate goodness. I had a great server and she made sure all was good during my visit.  Next time I'm in the area I'll come back for another dessert and a good meal...everything I saw coming out of the kitchen looked and smelled delicious!",

Luckily they have plenty of seating and the wait was less than 15 minutes.  We needed a highchair which they were able to accommodate easily.   The food came at a reasonable time, and I ordered the French Toast Napolean.  This was the THICKEST french toast I have ever had.  The portion sizes here are insane.  I also got a size of their sausage, which was some of the best breakfast sausage I've had.   A member of my group ordered the berry pancakes, and for whatever reason, they weren't ready when everyone else's food was.  Instead of making us all wait and giving us heat lamp warmed food, they brought our food - AND a whole plate of regular pancakes for my friend to eat while she waited for her food.  This was very unnecessary, but the main reason for the 5 star rating.  The food was all very good - solid - I wouldn't say there was anything special or amazing about it, but nothing was bad, or even okay.  I think the food is a solid 4 stars, but with the whole experience factored in, they get the 5 star rating.   Our friend has already been back twice, and it's only been 2 weeks if that says anything about them.   Definitely, a great stop if you're in the area.",

Doing some additional work for a few hours back at the hotel and I was getting slightly hangry and irritable at 830pm EST.    It is impossible to leave Central Dinner hungry - just looking at the desserts display will put Cheesecake Factory to shame.  The restaurant feels like an upscale version of Denny's, except imagine the menu expanded to include Seafood, Greek, and Italian cuisine.  The portion sizes are among the largest I've seen at any restaurant, and at rock-bottom prices.  Overall: 3 stars - food was good, but not spectacular.  Definitely quantity over quality here.  I ordered:  1. Spanakopita Appetizer: Flakey, decent, but wished it was warmer.  Gigantic for an appetizer.  One of my vegetarian coworkers got the entree version which turned out to be 3x the size (I expected 2x) of mine.  2. Italian Wedding Soup: This came as a free side dish with entree.  Pretty good - can't go wrong with meatball soup.  3. Grilled Chicken Plate: Gigantic, so large I could not finish all the carbs.  Chicken white meat grilled and seasoned perfectly and paired with grilled onions and bell peppers on top a huge 6\" diameter flatbread.  Then next to it, a gigantic portion of rice pilaf.  The food was good but overwhelming.  A good place for dinner as they open late.  Maybe best to order just one item each here: appetizer, entree, or dessert since everything is massive here.",

This place looked packed, so we figured there had to be a reason for that.   We got Spanakopita as an appetizer. The phyllo was slightly too done but the filling was very good. It was a bit of a small portion for an appetizer, I wouldn't split it between more than 2 people.   I ordered the Novia Scotia Benedict, and bf ordered the Chicken Cordon Bleu. The portions are HUGE as everyone has mentioned. Each of us only hate half of our meal. Everything was very good, no complaints except that I didn't care for the home fries. They weren't bad, just not my style.   The stand out, oddly, was the bread served with my meal. It tasted like it was fresh from a home bread machine, served warm with butter. I wish I had a whole loaf of it!   Service was excellent. Prices are reasonable - entrees are on the pricier side, but not terrible. Two meals + an app was around $40 (we drank water).

The staff stays very busy turning empty tables; even that busy, servers pay close attention to your needs. Huge servings, great variety, and interesting specials. Had the fried sole with broccoli the first night. Fish was nicely done, lightly crisp, cooked perfectly.  One down side:  broccoli was stone cold. Took cheesecake back to my room for later. It was delicious -- light, creamy, and crumbly just like I like it. Not overly sweet.  Returned for breakfast next day in a snowstorm. Not as busy yet. Tried the Hallah bread French toast with strawberries, bananas, pecans, and honey. Only had one piece, as the full order is two. It was enormous!!  But so delicious, I ate the entire thing!!

(They serve breakfast all day, which is a bonus).     We had a family birthday celebration there yesterday and everyone was very happy with their meal choices.  The house salads are large enough to be a meal in itself.  The Greek salad was good and their Greek dressing is excellent and isn't the usual oily vinaigrette.  If you can, save room for dessert.. (check out the cakes when you arrive!).    Prices are reasonable given the size of the portions.  The servers are very friendly and are very helpful with the menu if you have questions.   Highly recommended!!",

Maybe I need to try some other items on the menu to see if it might merit more than three stars.   I had a basic egg breakfast with Canadian bacon. The over easy eggs were cooked fine, and the home potatoes were really good. I have no complaints about the Canadian bacon. The breakfast came with a couple of pieces of buttered toast. Nothing was too out of the ordinary, but that might have more to do with the menu choice I made.  The coffee was nothing special.   The restaurant itself is large, clean and modern looking, but just a little too generic looking.  I took a look over the menu and it was huge. They offer something for every taste. I would definitely give this diner another try. The cakes behind the counter looked scrumptious.",

We got a massive plate full of bland pickles fried in batter that was not really attached to the skinny, dried out pickles.  The chunky yet watery marinara that came with them was not good for dipping, and was equally bland.  We ate a few, but there were many left over.  For$9 this was disappointing.  My wife got a grilled cheese sandwich, which should be a staple of a good diner,  and mashed potatoes ($3extra).  I got the Spanikopita... A \"Greek special\".  The food was, again bland.  The grilled cheese was not good, and the Spanikopita was worse.  The phylo dough was dense, and chewy. The filling was dry and tasteless.  The side salad that came with it had been sitting around for a while.  Beer selection was very limited.  Total bill was $41, which was over priced for the quality.  We will not go back.",

We got there around 6 and the place was packed, although it really cleared out after 7. Service was good and prompt for it being so busy. There were a huge amount of food options and I settled on the London broil sandwich. The meat was great but the bun was very soggy. My sister got a chicken dish that looked awesome, as did the salad my cousin got. Many of the servings were huge. I was a little disappointed in beer options - was looking forward to some local drafts but there were no drafts, let alone local bottles. Their cocktail list looked very promising. I would definitely go back and try out something else, like one of the panini sandwiches or chicken dinner options.",

Better than anything around within miles.  They have a lot of seating, which is good for breakfast time on the weekends because they can get pretty packed. I consider it a better tasting IHOP/Denny's/Eat N Park with a Greek/Mediterranean twist.  Their servings are kind of crazy big!  My husband and I can share a lot of the things on the menu.  Make sure you take a look at the specials that are on the chalkboard in the front of the restaurant or ask your server about them.  I've been continually impressed with the specials over the past couple of months.  Food: Just be prepared for the large portions.  When I order their gyro salad I typically ask them to box up half before it even gets to me because I already know it's going to be too much lol!  And I'm extreme... I don't think I like the lettuce on the gyro salad so I ask to substitute spinach instead and put the dressing on the side so that I can take home whatever I don't eat.  I'm not sure where they buy their vegetables, but their tomatoes are so juicy and delicious every time (mmmmmm)!  For breakfast/brunch sometimes I order the omelette but it's a lot of egg (almost too much for me).  I also like the grilled cheese, but it's almost too much sandwich (getting the picture here?). I do like that they added wine/beer (maybe liquor? I don't remember because I always get a bottle of beer or a mimosa).    Dessert: get a cake slice.  You likely will be full from your meal, so worst case order one to go.  My favorite is the white cake with the birthday sprinkles on there.  One time they forgot about my meal and the manager got me a free slice of cake to go (a man after my own heart)!    Since I live in the area it's one of the only continual staples I go to all the time.  I don't know what I'd do without them!  I order things for pickup all of the time as well.",

We order fried calamari for an appetizer and we couldn't believe how much food came out! It was pretty good considering it's called a diner! I had the gyro platter for my main course and she got the stuffed pepper. Everything was delicious and fresh. They went above and beyond when we left, we forgot the bag with the leftovers. They chased us down to the parking lot to make sure we got our food!",

    "text": "Are you ever hungry and not quite sure what you want? Then this is the answer! The Central diner is what you would expect from a diner style restaurant and way more. It really is not your typical diner, but one that has elevated to the status of a \"foodie favorite\". Sure you can get a great traditional breakfast, lunch or dinner that will satisfy anyone in your party's craving because the menu covers it all and with a hint Greek favorites as a bonus. But the menu here offers so many options like the traditional favorites, but they also daily specials as well as unique options you will not find at your typical diner establishment.  Breakfast is a favorite here when we are planning a day of shopping. It is a great way to start the day. Forget the chain restaurants that are surrounding the area, unless you want mediocre food. Go here and try a different daily special. You won't be disappointed.  My only complaint is that I don't live close enough to stop here more often to be able to try even more items they offer. I want to try just about anything in their bakery case. Just looking at some of the cakes and goodies is truly a delight! The cakes are amazing!  The restaurant itself is designed in a contemporary style and tastefully decorated. The service is fast and efficient. The restaurant is very clean and can be very busy at times. Prices are reasonable for an upscale diner.  This has become a favorite of ours and is added to our list of \"go to\" places when in the area. Do yourself a favor and \"go there\" too!",

The food for the most part is good, not great, but better than most in the area.  As you  walk thru the door the dessert case catches your eye and makes them hard to resist.  While beautiful to look at  they aren't as tasty as they appear.  Last nights $5.95 slice of cake was so dry, when tapping it with my fork, my fork bounced off.  When asked by the staff how our meal was I honestly replied \"the cake was dry and stale\", and demonstrated the tap test so she could see, She said \"Oh\" and took my credit card and processed my bill.  Very disappointing.",

Now, I get people have bad days, we all do, but this was not the case. She was either shy, which on that case is in the wrong business, or she was poorly trained, which that is on the business. Either way, it's a shame because I've been wanting to try this place out for a while and this was the first impression I get. We did explain to the manager the issues, he kindly said we didn't need to pay for our drinks, which I would have. Maybe someday we'll give another try, but for now, it's totally on the back burner.",

Honestly, I was not only impressed with the food (which was incredible), but the quality of care we received from the staff. The manager was visable on the floor checking on customers, the waitstaff was checking in but not obnoxious and overbaring, and the food was totally worth it. Upon leaving I bumped into the owner in the parking lot, I couldn't resist complimenting him on the restaurant. This man is humble, honorable, and sweet. I cannot wait to return. :)",

The French onion soups cheese was burnt to a crisp, not sure why they sent it out, and for dinner I had the turkey, stuffing, and mashed potatoes. The turkey wasn't bad, expect for the odd taste from sitting on top of the stuffing. I had pulled the turkey off and the stuffing turned out to be raisin bread, just a slice. I had asked the waitress if this was supposed to be the cinnamon swirl bread or if there was a mistake. She went and got the manager, who was a huge guy that was just plan rude. On top of that, my moms chicken sandwich was raw in the middle. Not the best dinner....",

Not a problem since the menu is extremely large but apparently the \"certain entrees only after 5:00pm\" is applied subjectively to certain waitresses????  I first asked for chicken piccata and my wife asked for a baked potato as her side and we were informed that neither was available for 45 minutes (5pm) so we ordered a sandwich and fries - LITERALLY 2 MINUTES LATER THEY SERVED A PLATE OF CHICKEN PICCATA AND A BAKED POTATO SIDE TO THE TABLE DIRECTLY ADJACENT TO US!!!!    When we asked why we couldn't have the dinner items we asked for we were told that table was served by a waitress that wasn't new.   So I guess we have to be sure to always ask for waitress that has been working here for a while to get the best service!!!  LMFAO",

My aunt was visiting town and after we found out our first restaurant choice was closed, we  browsed yelp and decided on this place. Central Diner did not disappoint! Our waiter was quick and so friendly. It was pretty slow, so he kept coming back to the table to make jokes and talk with us. He was super friendly and funny.   My aunt ordered angel hair pasta with meat sauce, my husband got a Greek salad, liver and onions with a side of gravy fries, and I ordered the chicken avocado melt (my food came with a side of slaw and a pickle as well). All of the food was cooked to perfection, no complaints whatsoever. I had to ask for a box because the chicken breast on my sandwich was SO thick and juicy that it filled me up and I couldn't finish the other half. We all taste tested each other's food because everything on the table looked so mouthwatering! I'm a big french fry fan and these were perfect to me. The menu is HUGE with a wide variety of options ranging from your typical breakfast bites to Norwegian salmon.  We definitely want to visit again to taste more of the menu!",

The menu is quite large and has just about all the comfort food you want. Breakfast fare wasn't necessarily the best I've ever had, but certainly lives up to diner standards and was incredibly well-priced and well-portioned, so much so that I didn't need to eat much for the rest of the day. Service is fairly quick and efficient, if perfunctory.   A decent place to visit if you're in the immediate area and don't want to wait terribly long on a weekend morning.",

I can count like only one other restaurant that serves warm house bread.  The next thing I got was the French Onion Soup. It was an up charge but it was so worth it.  I got the Meat Loaf and it was so amazing. I got extra gravy to go with it and man, best tasting meat loaf I had in a while. I even had some extra to take home and eat later. One thing I liked that they offer here is one of your sides can be Spaghetti. Thats like a meal in itself. I really like the variety I got with my dinner.  Honestly, I was not only impressed with the food (which was incredible), but the quality of care we received from the staff. The manager was visable on the floor checking on customers, the waitstaff was checking in but not obnoxious and overbaring, and the food was totally worth it.   As we were leaving, the dessert case looked so good and wanted a slice of everything. I was full and still wanted dessert, thats how good it looked.   I will return and tell my friends that this is a terrific restaurant!",

French fries were great too, as I'm particular about fries. Nice and crispy! I will make this place a tradition now any time I'm flying in or out.

    "text": "Came here for a late lunch early afternoon.  Hubby ordered chicken fingers and french fries from the kids menu and I ordered their veggie omelette.  What's hot - Flavor, our meals were pretty decent.  Nothing that blows your mind, but it's alright.  The cheese in my veggie omelette was mostly in the middle and didn't go through the entire omelette.  I didn't see the cauliflower in my veggie, but I, guessing it was there. Call me picky, but dudes, details matter.   - Menu variety.  They serve breakfast all day, which is awesome.  They have some Greek and Italian menu options in their own section.  They have a children's meal section, too.  It's nice to see a gyro as an option.  Dunno how fresh the meat is, but there ya go. - Parking lot is a good size.  This place seems to be pretty popular among the locals, which means it can get busy fast.  Their parking lot is accommodative of that, which is great. - Layout.  The inside is a good space and can accommodate a decent number of people.  But be aware, this place gets busy fast.    What's not - Service.  Our waitress didn't give us any bread.  We didn't notice that others were getting a bread basket until we left.  In other words, we saw bread baskets on other tables and that's when we figured out we didn't get one.  In other words, their service is shoddy.  Additionally, we had to wait quite a while for our waitress to take our order.  Another waitress had to ask us if we needed anything.  We told her we were ready to order, but couldn't find our waitress.    - Traffic.  Getting in and out of the parking lot is a chore and can take a while because of the surrounding traffic.  While this isn't within the restaurant's control, it's something to be aware of.  Final answer Am willing to come back, but not a first choice.",

Very disappointed. Waitress was not friendly she even brought us some else's food. I'm sad to say the quality has gone way down. All the things I used to enjoy are not the same. I normally tip very generous but this time she lost me for a little extra sauce... and poor service.  Keep your 6 dollar sauce! I'll keep my money.  I'm going to pass on this place. Also one more thing I though it was strange how loud the workers were, they would talk very loudly across the restaurant. \" what's your number?\" For putting things in the computer. Don't yell across the restaurant, people are trying to eat. I think they can use some customer service help. Be professional.",

    "text": "A birthday meal is a birthday meal, whether you buy it for yourself or not.  I recently celebrated a birthday and didn't want to impose myself on others, so I took it upon myself to find a nearby place while out shopping and with a quick look at a Yelp map came across this place.  I love a diner and when I saw that it the moniker I had to come here.  I arrived at a busy time, but that didn't impact my service at all.  When I walked in I was about to be sat at a booth or table before I said I would be fine sitting at the counter.  I appreciated the concern for my comfort, but I wanted to see how well this place was run.  And it was run like a well oiled machine.    While looking at the menu I was greeted by a smile and a glass of water.  I asked for a few minutes to look over the menu and was left to be for a few minutes.  While looking over the menu you notice that they take the diner menu and go upscale with it, I'll touch on that a bit later.  After skimming descriptions of items on the menu I found what I was looking for.  My go to for a diner, meatloaf.  I can't tell you why it's always meatloaf at a diner for me, but it always is.  Whether it's a meatloaf sandwich or just a pile of sliced meatloaf, to me that is a diner style meal.  This meatloaf was to come with mushroom gravy, a side and either soup or salad.  I had asked to keep the mushrooms off the plate, opted for a side of mashed potatoes with gravy, and a house salad with ranch dressing.  The salad was a nice blend of lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, and red onions.  No need to ask for extra dressing here as they give you a generous portion.  No sooner did I finish the salad than my main course showed up.  With being in the diner mind set, I was thinking a portion that would make it a quick eat, was I ever wrong.  Three big pieces of meatloaf covered in gravy, without mushrooms, and a side of mashed potatoes.  The meatloaf was fall apart goodness.  Each bite was amazing and no spice used was overpowering.  What I enjoyed most was that they used whole cloves of garlic in the meatloaf.  I pitied any person I was came in contact with after this meal just because of the amount of garlic i devoured.  The side of mashed potatoes were amazing as well.  Light and fluffy with the right amount of lumps in them.  You would think that after I devoured all that, I wouldn't be able to fit any more in my belly, but I dared to go for dessert.  Why not treat myself?  I went with the cheesecake, simple yet just sweet enough for me.  Sprinkled with powdered sugar and a few dabs of whipped cream.  The cheesecake was light and melted in my mouth.  Now, when I tell you I was stuffed when I left here, I mean I was over the brim stuffed.  All I wanted to do was lay down and take a nap after this meal.  The staff were amazing and like I said this place ran like a well oiled machine.  From the front of the house to the kitchen.  Servers were well versed in all things this restaurant offered and always there when you needed them.  The kitchen staff were on point and did not mess a single thing up.  The kitchen manager was shouting out orders to keep everyone on track.  They even came out to chat with the regular customers.  A great establishment to dine at, definitely going to be coming back here.",

    "text": "By far, this is my favorite restaurant in the area and I have been here multiple times, but today's level of service (or lack thereof) has pissed me off royally!   It is a very busy Friday night, and it's cold outside and raining. I understand that they are frazzled and rushing around to meet everyone's needs.   However, I too am a paying customer. And after spending over $50 for our meals, we walked over to the dessert display to buy a piece of cake to take home, but everyone seems to be FAR too busy to help us.   Multiple employees including the owner repeatedly looked past us as though they had better things to do. We even verbally asked one of the servers for that section to help us and she passed the buck to someone else... Once we asked that second person... She told the other employee to \"find someone else to do it.\" At one point she even went into the kitchen and asked if anybody in there \"wasn't busy\"; and after getting no answer she just went on helping other customers.  This is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable! I mean even the cashier who was standing about 2 ft. away was far too busy to help us or to get someone else to help us.  When we FINALLY got the cake (about 15 minutes later) we went to ring it up at the register, and the cashier had WAY too much attitude.  He never thanked us for our patronage. He put my change in my hand, laid the receipt on the counter and just turned his back on us and went to doing other things.. I had to ask him if our transaction was finished and thank HIM for helping me.   Then, it gets even better. The OWNER walked over to our table and asked us if everything was okay. I told him that it wasn't. I told him everything WAS okay until we went to try to get a piece of cake. He told us that our server needed to help us. I told him that we wanted to look at the cakes and ask someone what the various flavors were so that we can make a selection. He asked \"who didn't help\" us and seemed to be insistent that we could have done that from the table and then he just walked off in a huff. Apparently this rudeness comes from the top down. (Set that example, Sir).   So noted! If you're too busy to serve your customers then you're just too busy. You're not doing me any favors...I know how to cook and I can eat at home. It will be quite a while before I ever come back to Rudeville...if ever!",

I know I've eaten at many other places and have paid much more for less. Our server tonight (Seth) was spot on. He seemed to have the largest section (the counter, the booths along the window, & the patio) and he was wonderful! I had to bring half of my dinner home....and got a piece of Buckeye cake to go. (Their cakes are made by Signature desserts & I love them!) We will return.....hopefully sooner rather than later!!",

The ambiance is lovely; I dined here when it was a Denny's (which has a pretty basic look) and I am shocked that this place could look so good! The renovation is beautiful - it looks nice without you thinking that you're underdressed for the look or overdressed for a diner.  This place is often packed, but we are often here a high traffic times so I'm not sure if they ever have a slow time!   The staff is great! The hosts/hostesses are friendly, the servers are attentive and the barracks/bus boys are so fast! The management are also great and very supportive of their staff. You can tell that the employees who work here enjoy it.  The food is excellent and the portions are huge! I have never had a bad plate. The Greek dishes are very good, but I love that they also have traditional American diner fare too. Central has a little something for everyone, so this place is great for a family or a group of people with different tastes.  I don't often have room left over for dessert, but once I got a slice of their raspberry almond torte cake (to go of course!) and it was delicious!! If I had any complaint, it may be that there are SO MANY cake options and when they're gone, they're gone, so they don't have a list. It's hard to know if you're making the right decision when you have to remember 14 different types of cake!  I think my life goal is to try everything on their menu, but I definitely have my favorites so that may be easier said than done!!!",

The decor is contemporary. They have a full bar. They have a small waiting area but we went at an odd hour of the day so we didn't have to wait.  I am a huge fan of breakfast so I ordered chocolate chip pancakes. The portions are enormous!  The pancakes were really good. I took over half of my plate of pancakes home. (They were still good when reheated.) Their menu is huge!!  The choices are almost overwhelming. They have amazing cakes. The table next to ours was celebrating a birthday and everyone ordered desserts. The slices of cake were also very large and the people at the table said they were delicious.  I definitely want to go back and try more of their items. I was watching servers take plates to other people's tables and all of the food looked good. The dining area is large and can accommodate large parties of up to 14 or so people.  If you haven't tried it you should go. You won't be disappointed.",

Not that pleasant. Upon arrival, the man who seated us had an urgent stride and speech. He was very quick to walk us to the table...and sat us near the restroom, meanwhile the main dining room had ample seating.  We requested to move because we didn't want to sit near the restroom. So he speedily walked us over to the main dining room (we were about a good 10 feet behind him).   When seated, we felt rushed by the server also. She came over about a minute after we sat, asked for our drinks then asked if we were ready. We barely opened our menu.   During our meal, I observed the same host seating other patrons, but his stride was very casual.  I observed this with at least 5 parties.  It makes me wonder if it was us that was being rushed.  When we paid, the man at the register was inattentive; he was watching TV...along with the host.  Food: OK. Standard diner food but below mediocre. I ordered the Greek omelet with home fries. Home fries - Half of my home fries were burnt; it was the bottom of the skillet and the cook basically scraped it and put it on a plate. Omelet - The ratio of omelet contents (gyro meat, tomatoes, etc.) was disproportionate to the amount of egg.  Also, the egg whites were not fully beaten as it was still a bit runny in the omelet.  Ambience: Lively. Noise level was average.  It is noisy but not overly where you can't interact with people in your party.",

The lavish Spanish omelette provides an authentic ethnic born of peppers and onions, coated with a light but flavor packed chorizo sauce. Paired with a side of home style home fries created the perfect blend of culture with comfort. Next is the French toast deluxe. Deluxe doesn't quite explain the soft and buttery showcase that invades every taste bud. The sizes of these pillows of bread may seem intimidating at first, but you'll soon find its a struggle to put your fork down.the accompanying sides of ham, bacon, and sausage tops this meal off with class.",

When I see late night - I think of the greasy spoon that is open after the bars close (2:30 AM).      Atmosphere:  Very nice and new.    The place was clean and did not look like a greasy spoon I was expecting.    Everything seemed pretty new (remodel).    It was a Denny's in a past life.  Food:  I ordered the Fish Sandwich and Carrot Cake.    The fish sandwich was huge and good.   The portions were large.  The carrot cake was very good.   I could see large chunks of carrots.   I wish there was less icing on the cake - very sugary.  I would have preferred a cream cheese frosting (but that is me).  Prices:  Breakfast and Sandwiches seem pretty reasonable (a little more than Bob Evans / traditional restaurant places).   Their entrees are really expensive ($12-20).  Overall - I will be back.   I want to try their breakfast.  Summary:  Atmosphere - Very nice.   Everything is new. Service - I had a great waitress who enhanced the experience Food - The food was good but not anything to set it apart from other places in the area Price - on the pricey side.",

They were not very busy for 8pm on a Friday night. We sat at the counter. What used to be a former Denny's has been transformed into a stylish diner. Our waiter (who has been there since they opened) did not miss a beat. The menu is vast so we took his dinner suggestion of stuffed peppers and mashed potatoes. Each meal came with a diner salad and warmed Ciabatta bread. The stuffed pepper was the size of a softball, which was stuffed to the brim with deliciousness. It came with a vast amount of sauce and homemade mashed potatoes. We had left overs for the next several meals. We took some chocolate cake home. We had a great experience. We are looking forward to coming back.",

Speaking of services, we went when it was absolutely slammed and we were well taken care of and our server was remarkable.  First we ordered fried zucchini which was amazing and it normally comes with a side of marinara which was definitely homemade and so delicious. I like ranch so I asked for a side of ranch. What they brought was hidden valley in a bowl. Disclaimer: I hate hidden valley, so if you like that kind of ranch, you're in for a treat. I was hoping for a less viscous and more buttermilk based dressing, but alas no.  Then we got French onion soup which was amazing.  Next was the main course. My husband got chicken parmesan which he loved. I got a burger which was disappointing. The patty tasted like it was frozen and pre-shaped rather than fresh. It was just dry and there was crystallized fat that was inedible. Pretty disappointed with that as well.  Then we paid and got dessert to go. I had chocolate strawberry which was honestly flavorless and dry. My husband got raspberry almond which was just incredible.  So long story short (too late), all around the food is very good and the service is out of this world.",

The manager was cool and took my meal off my bill but I'm still hesitant about going back.

My husband thought the bread on his sandwich was a little doughy, but I was happy w my meal. The coleslaw was delicious, but it could have been seasoned a little more. I would like to try this diner for breakfast; it looks like their specialty.",

I had shepards pie the first time and it was so different from what I normally make (I cook only from scratch also) but it was unbelievable! The size of the meals are huge! I ate half of it and split the rest with my daughter for lunch the next day!! I think it was about 10 bucks! And came with a salad!!!  The service is wonderful and the place is very very clean, but really what makes this place for me is knowing that I am getting a quality meal that hasn't been frozen or processed, but is soooo yummy! :) the location kinda stinks, but honestly I would run across that 6 lane road like frogger to get some more of that shepards pie!!

The menu has a broad selection so there is definitely something for everyone. I had the chicken napolitano with penne pasta and the Greek salad. The salad was awesome! Lots of cheese and olives and the dressing tasted great. The entree had two huge chicken breasts and lots of mushrooms and red peppers. I'm not a fan of eating red peppers but I like the flavor. They were in slices so were easy to eat around. It was very good. My husband had the chicken Mediterranean which he said was very good as well. He had the red clam chowder.  My husband came a few nights ago and had the shepherds pie. He said that while it is not the traditional style it was very good. They bring out a bread basket as well which was fresh. We didn't have room for dessert but we took a slice a carrot cake and red velvet to go. The red velvet was good but the carrot cake was to die for. My husband travels here for work and said this will now be his go to restaurant.",

The waitress asked if I wanted a box and I explained I didn't care for it.  To my surprise when I got my check for my soup and drink they had taken it off.  I hunted down the younger manager and told him there was nothing wrong with it, just I didn't care for it, it wasn't their fault.  I said I would pay and he insisted NO.... if I didn't like it/eat it he wasn't going to charge for it.  I actually argued with him about it and he insisted!  OUTSTANDING service.

Then we get inside and it has a Denny's/steak escape feel to it. It was extremely loud with all the people in it (this was Sunday around 12:30) then I started to get a little disappointed with the place since it got 4.5 stars. Then we get our food, my wife ordered the tender (not fried) scallops and I don't like scallops, but they had a really good taste to them. My burger felt like just a really good home cooked burger. So all in all the flavor or the food won me over. Just don't expect a quiete calm restaurant, this place is hustle and bustle lol. I'd recommend this place to someone especially for a Sunday brunch or maybe a late night out with a group of friends, not really a 1on1 date place :)",

There is an owner there almost 24/7 and they really keep the wait staff on the ball. They always make it a point to visit the tables, check in on customers and see how everything is going. If the restaurant is busy then of course it takes a little longer for food, but that happens everywhere. The food has always been very good, the prices are reasonable and I've never had a negative experience with one of the servers. I recommend Central to all of my out of town friends and they all love it!   The only reason I've given this 4 stars instead of 5 is because their vegan/vegetarian choices are limited. Most everything is made with meat, cheese and/or eggs. I usually can only order the same 2-3 things each time, which is fine for me...but a little variety would be nicer. Still a great restaurant nonetheless!",

My coffee cup was filed regularly and the waitress was pleasant.   On to the food. Two of us got the special of the day, French Toast Napoleon.  This was a challah bread French toast with strawberries, bananas, walnuts and honey. In addition, you had a choice of sausage or bacon. The toast was delicious. Nicely browned with an excellent flavor. The berries and bananas were fresh and ripe. No syrup was necessary on this entree. The portions were huge and we could have split this and been satisfied.   My husband had an omelet that he said was very good. The only issue was that my daughter ordered eggs over medium and they arrived over easy.   Very enjoyable meal. I will be happy to go back the next rikme we are in he area.",

They put so much turkey, roast beef, ham, and cheese on it that it's hard to finish it all. But I usually always do. One piece of advice is to ask for the roast beef to be well done, because sometimes it comes out a little too raw for my liking (like prime rib, of which I am not a fan). Also, the dining room itself can get pretty loud, and for some reason its always cold. Nonetheless, it could be 20 degrees with kids screaming, and I would still go there for their chef salad alone. I can't really speak to the rest of the menu, because I rarely stray from what I like.",

Having been here four times now and impressed every time they have earned my 5 stars.    When you walk in the restaurant is impressive.  The design is well done and it gives off a high end appearance.  As you are seated in large comfortable booths or at the tables and presented the large menu, you might just feel overwhelmed as pretty much everything looks appealing.  You mean I have to pick just one?  The menu ranges from 3 different kinds of eggs Benedict to stuffed French toast for breakfast.  They also have lunch and dinner but I never seem to get that far.  The portions are large and the price is very reasonable.  They also always have lots of specials that change every time I've been in.  I did get shepherds pie on special once for lunch and it was delish. It was a huge square cut with homemade mash and a great meat / vegetable bottom.  Very tasty indeed.    Do yourself a favor and give central a try.  I'm positive you'll be happy you did.",

For dessert we got the brownie a la mode with the whipped cream. The brownie was OK (average at best) but the ice cream and whip cream were quite good. The service was fast and efficient. I would definitely go back and try other things on the menu.",

The zucchini was long and light - the marinara that was served with both was A+++.  Hubs had the meatloaf and it was HUGE.  He enjoyed it last night and will enjoy it again today or tomorrow!  Friend had the Reuben and it was well stacked and not messy...  as some tend to be.  Friend #2 had the Cobb Salad - It was a monster and her favorite, they are not new to the Diner.  I chose the Bleu Burger and it was done perfectly - I had to ditch the bun part way through and abandon the fries altogether.  The slaw was not to my liking, very creamy and too wet for me, but that is my preference.  Overall: good service, big food and no frills.",

Seems like the parking lot is always full... A big sign of a good diner.   I forget exactly what I ordered,, since I am writing this review late, but all in all the whole enjoy their meal. The menu is huge and was hard deciding what to eat. the only Compliant I had I was expecting the huge plate of food.. Both me and my son was surprised. I already knew it was going to be big by looking at everyone plates as we walked to our table. So if you come here make sure you are good and hungry.   I think this would be easily a 5 star rating in my books but I need to eat more here and try out dishes and see what I like. but for a first time being here I was really impressed",

I ordered the prime rib special. I ordered it medium rare. It came out well done. That happens from time to time, no problem. The manager came out and apologized. That was good. The issue that I have is that he explained what happened. He said that they cook the prime rib on Saturday and Sunday. They then cut it and put it under the broiler as they need it throughout the week. In other words, they reheat several day old prime rib. That is not what I would expect from a decent restaurant.   They did take it back and got me a another meal.",

She thought the shrimp batter was horrible, worst she ever had, and her potato had a big human hair in it.  She told the server, and was given a replacement potato, but nothing was done about the shrimp.  She also told the cashier (a young fellow), but he didn't care.  No cheers this time.",

The audiovisual equipment was an easy setup.  The menu is extensive.  To expedite ordering, I asked our waitress to name the best sellers: Greek offerings, daily specials, and stuffed peppers.  Hmmm ...  I had the Greek spinach pie with the greek salad.  Very large portions.  The standard salad dressing was red/orange very good ... and I forgot to ask if I could buy a bottle.  Looking around the table, I saw gryos, salads, fried appetizers, and sandwiches.  Most people had lunch for the next day.    The dessert counter should be the first stop. Cakes are over a foot high (carrot, chocolate, red velvet, tiramasu, etc). I should have decided on dessert than ordered dinner.  I kmow better for next time.  Through the windows, I saw families, couples, and singles enjoying their meals.  Definitely will be back with friends to try the other menu options.",

They have a large menu with breakfast, lunch, and dinner items and a lot of them are Greek as I assume the owners are Greek. The food is higher end than a typical diner.   I ordered the Greek salad with salmon and the Thursday soup of the day which was something like a lemon chicken if I remember correctly.  The salad with salmon wasn't cheap, but it was huge and had a ton of salmon.  The dressing was tasty as well.  The soup was thick like bisque and had some good flavor as well.  I will return with the many options they have.",

The menu is huge, and when that's the case it is a direct negative correlation with the food quality. Everything here is just decent. The portions are huge though, and the prices kind of reflect that. My suggestion: reduce the quantity, adjust prices and focus on quality.   The pasta fra diavolo used to be really good but recently it became bland and soupy. Last night I ordered the wings and they were just little tiny wing dings which were mostly breading. We also ordered the poutine off of the appetizer menu and they brought out a giant pan of it, but it contained little gravy (uh hello, that's what poutine is all about). Disappointed.   My mom got the chicken cordon blue which was fine too. The sauce was really good but I couldn't help but think the chicken cordon blue itself was pre-made frozen from some GFD or something like that.   The service is excellent, everyone is hustling, and the place itself is pretty clean and unassuming. If you're looking for a low-risk place to grab a bite, you can try it out but there are TONS of better options in the Pittsburgh area for better food at the same price.",

Not to mention all the pasta, steaks, and seafood they offer after 5pm for dinner.  The quality of the food gets an A+ for sure! Everything was homemade, fresh- not frozen, and giant portions.

The stuffed mushrooms were stuffed with so much bread that I couldn't taste the crab. The filet of sole didn't taste like anything, regardless of what I was promised. I'm not sure if I caught the kitchen on a bad day but everything was blah. Thankfully, it's tough to mess up a baked potato, so at least I ate something. The manager tried to fix things but I was so disappointed with everything I was served, I didn't want anything else. So go if you want good service, but don't go if you want good food.",

    "text": "So disapointed.  I used to really love this place until this past Saturday.  Honesty worse experience ever in a restaurant.   I'm a pretty easy customer. I want my coffee, my order, my book and pretty much nothing else.  Stop by 1 or 2 times to make sure I don't need a refill or extra napkins and I'm good.  Saturday the place was empty...I couldn't get my waitress to stop by the table for anything.  I never did get the extra napkins nor was I offered a refill on my drink.   the very \"pretty\" manager, well he thought he was pretty...thought that it was acceptable to stand at the cash register/bar area and make rude comments about the guests in the restaurant.  He was horrible.  He had a comment for every waitress and for everyone from the kitchen who stopped to bs with him as he stood there texting on his phone.  very professional for a manager.  The hostess, I don't know if se is painfully shy or incredibly rude.  She was unable to look me in the eye when I paid my bill.  she never asked if everything was okay or even said thank you.  That irritates me so much that I called her on it.  I said, thank you for asking if everything was okay...her response...You're welcome.  I said, you never asked.  she still couldn't respond or look up.  Not great for a hostess to not be able to look at a customer.  The manager who came on duty as I was leaving gets kudos for coming outside to talk to me about my experience...unfortunately I was too angry to discuss it with him then.   the food has gone downhill in the last year....the staff in there on Saturday afternoon was TERRIBLE!  Service was BAD and I'm so disapointed because I have always",

    "text": "Formally Denny's, this place has definitely gotten an upgrade to what I would call upscale casual.  I requested and was given a booth.  Decor is nice.  I thought it was too cold to be comfortable, and I notice one other reviewer mentioned this as well.  My server {I'm afraid I don't remember his name} gave quite good service, although he was wearing an INCREDIBLY dirty apron.  I was in the mood for a great burger, so I ordered the Jack Burger.  AWESOME!!  It arrived in timely fashion, with the cole slaw {Maybe the best I've ever had!} delivered first.  Fries were very good, and the burger...ah, the burger...was wonderful!  A tasty bun, very good meat, LOTS of grilled onions which is a big hooray for me, pepper jack cheese, and what I believe was a chipotle sauce.  Yummy!!  Now, the onions were very slippery, and I realized that if I even considered picking the burger up, I would have a completely onion-covered outfit.  So I ingeniously cut half of it up and proceeded to enjoy it greatly.  As the burger was quite large, I took it and half the cole slaw home.  The only downside of the dining experience for me was that, in a nearly empty restaurant {it was only about 4:15}, a family with {well-behaved yet loud and a bit whiney} children was seated directly behind me.  Thus the 4 star rather than a 5.  Other than that, however the place was 5 star all the way!",

    "text": "We spent almost a full year driving past this place saying \"we really need to go there!\"  Only a few weeks ago, we finally bit the bullet and we've been back four times now!  The usual places in Robinson (Eat 'n Park, Applebee's, TGIFridays, etc.) are fine, but I'm not a huge fan of the food.   Everything seems to taste the same.  However, everything we've had so far at Central has been fresh and amazing.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a selection of Greek items on the menu. The chicken souvlaki, gyro and Greek salad are all fabulous.  Their menu states that they use fresh ingredients, and it shows!  The tzatziki and their house-made Greek dressing are so flavorful and delicious.  Like none I've ever had out before. My husband had the chicken fajita wrap, which he loved.  We also went for breakfast and were really pleased with the fluffy omelets.  They seem to have about 10 or so specials daily, but do run out of them later in the night (presumably because they are made fresh and not \"off the shelf\" items).  They have a great selection of dessert items too.  We've only tried the chocolate cake, but it was moist and delicious.    To be honest, one of the reasons it took so long for us to stop in was that we heard it was a little pricey.  Some of the \"steakhouse-like\" entree items are priced a bit higher, but the majority of items are very comparable to their competition.  And actually, the portions are huge (I've had a minimum of 2-3 meals out of every dish) so it ends up being much more of a value if you do leftovers.  Definitely check it out... Don't let rumors about price stop you like it did us!  Just FYI, the fries are battered, which isn't really my preference.  But they are very crispy and served hot.  My husband is somewhat of a fry connoisseur :) and gives them a thumbs up!    The owner(s) have been out on the floor each time we've been there, and they are always super friendly, asking how everything is.  The waitresses we have had were all very nice, and it seems like the owners stay alert when there are new staff working tables to make sure nobody is neglected.    Finally, the atmosphere is very pleasant.  They are in the location where Denny's used to be, but I believe they gutted the building.  It looks great!    This is definitely our new favorite place in Robinson... And possibly one of my favorites in Pittsburgh!  There are a lot of menu items on my \"must try\" list, and I'm looking forward to many more great meals here!",

The gravy had a weird orange tint, but tasted ok. When I ordered the server asked if I wanted fries or mashed potatoes, I assumed this was because it came with one of those two & even though I didn't want either, I went with mashed potatoes. Not until I got my bill did I realize it was not included but was an additional charge. Wasn't happy about that. I ordered iced tea, no lemon & the tea was actually brewed with lemon. When I sent it back, the waitress seemed to think I was out of my mind thinking the tea had a lemon taste. I felt like both her & the owner were both offended by this. Weird. I felt the food was just ok. Not in any hurry to return. Maybe for breakfast but that's it. My bill for hot roast beef sandwich, mashed potatoes & water was $11. I could've gotten the same so so food a few doors down at Eat & Park for half the price & been able to drink the iced tea.",

This is a nice concept theme but it is not a diner. We found the menu pricey but very creative and ambituous in its scope. Service was slow and inattentive by our server and it took three trips to receive our complete order. Observing other tables, service seemed hit and miss. The verbally abusive cook or chef could be heard all over the restaurant (including the restroom) There was a very loud argument and other times he'd yell and threaten the servers (you're about to have your order wrong on every count\" and \"you're on my last nerve.\").  I overheard our server telling a regular (as she took out a personal fan and fanned herself) in response to his mild complaint about his order that \"our cook has a real attitude problem...) I mentioned to the manager about the loud cook that he's had issues with him for at least a month. Our breakfast was disappointing. My mate had a very ordinary cheese omelet for 8.95 with toast when it finally came. My waffle was very good but the bacon was greasy and obviously cooked well ahead of our order. The decor is very attractive and welcoming but, based on my experience and personal opinion,  I wouldn't return or recommend.",

While they have a vast menu with various options, the owners are Greek and the Greek food on the menu is poli kala! It's very clean and their customer service is excellent. The owners and the people they employ are hard workers. The last time we were there Rachel was our server, and she went above and beyond! While I do think it's a little pricy, you get a ton of food and the experience is always a good one:) And during a recent trip there my friend gave the manager some feedback as we were leaving. She said that she thought the ham steak she ordered for breakfast was salty. She wasn't asking for a refund, or for anything in return but, the manager insisted that the next time she came in that her breakfast would be on the house. Who does that nowadays? Not many places! Their Greek hospitality definitely shines through! I wish people would stop comparing it to a Denny's. Its not even in the same league! Just because the building used to be a Denny's doesn't mean that it needs to be constantly compared to it!",

Service is always top-notch; you can tell the owners and employees truly care about your dining experience, the taste and quality of your meal, etc. And portion sizes...huge! My first time eating here gluten free was no exception. While there is no gluten free menu, my server was well-versed in what was gluten free, from basic knowledge down to what entrees and even salad dressings are GF. Her recommendations were awesome and she even made sure to note that my meal needed to be gluten free for the kitchen staff.   Fantastic, fantastic experience! I am so happy that I can continue to eat here despite dietary needs.",

Now let me tell you I'm a big man and I can pack food away but the quality given to each of us was absolutely unreal.   Our local guest ordered dessert as an appetizer, we all laughed about it but he said that the last time he was there he didn't have room for dessert and wanted to make sure he got the homemade rice pudding.  Next time I'm in Pittsburgh, yes that's right I'm going to order dessert as an appetizer",

Firstly, We order a mimosa, it comes only halfway full, we take it back to the bar ourselves and ask for a full glass the bartender asks me do I want to pay for a double then I said no just to have my glass filled all the way so I say never mind I don't want it. Secondly, a diff server brings food to our table similar to what we've ordered, meanwhile it's for the table next to us, as we already started to eat off of it, then our server comes out and says oh no that's not yours and takes it back. Thirdly, our bacon wasn't well done as we requested and our server hands us our plates to grab ourselves instead of her setting them down as well as her literally making us hand her our plates when we're finished eating with her hand out. Lastly, she hands us our bill and our total balance said $0.00, so we ask her at the front if it was a mistake, all this time with having an attitude towards us and not nice, and didn't even tell my husband happy Father's Day with our daughter right next to him! Just All around bad experience here at Central Grille. We will never be returning again!",

I will have to update my review after we eat here a few more times but for now it's a solid four stars.  We went there for lunch  and got the greek salad with chicken, London broil sandwich and bread pudding for desert.   The Greek salad is huge and delicious!! It's exactly what you want when you order a greek salad. It came with warm soft pita bread and their great house dressing. The meat on the London broil sandwich was also great! Very flavorful and perfectly cooked. The only issue with the sandwich was the bun. With high expectations for the garlic roll as described in the menu, the basic soggy hamburger was a bit of a let down.  The bread pudding was also a big let down! The ice cream that came with it was awesome but the desert itself wasn't worth ordering. It's a fruitcake like pudding that was served at room temperature. With so many other amazing looking deserts I would not recommend it order this again.  Overall a great restaurant with a fantastic staff!",

When you walk in you see the coffee bar and you can feel the vibe as the place is pulsating with life. We sat down and were greeted by our waitress immediately. She took our drink orders and then read the giant list of specials (12 that night) before letting us digest the enormous menu as an appetizer.   My wife had the black and blue burger which was amazing. It was cooked perfectly and had blue cheese on the top and the bottom. My club sandwich was good and was made with real turkey breast instead of just the shaved lunch meat. The fries were fantastic as well and everyone devoured them. The other diners had dishes ranging from leg of lamb to a huge piece of salmon. Everyone was really happy and then our waitress asked about dessert!   The cakes and pies were so numerous that she actually handed us her list to look over. From \"death by chocolate\" to carrot cake to raspberry chocolate almond torte we were all impressed. We all took at least half of the giant pieces home for later. We will all be back soon!",

We had to ask for a number of things that our server should have taken care of initially. Also, we waited an extraordinary amount of time before finally getting our check.  Food - average. The menu is extensive. I ordered an egg (described as one egg only) and cheese breakfast sandwich with sausage. The experience was bizarre. First of all, I ordered the sandwich with sausage and cheese.   She left and came back and asked me if I wanted an egg also and if so, how I wanted my egg cooked. I have never, after ordering dozens upon dozens of breakfast egg sandwiches over the years, been asked this question. Egg sandwich always include an egg and always cooked the same way.  I requested that the egg be cooked firm.   What was presented to me was an open-faced sandwich that had two large eggs that were cooked over easy and the sausage was large links that were cut in half (a sausage patty is the norm). As a result, the sandwich was very soggy and it was impossible to eat without using a knife and fork.  Value - below average. I love diners and I would like to think that, with a different server and a different food item, I would have a better experience.",

    "text": "We stopped for a Sunday morning breakfast and asked to be seated outside, which was very nice.  Our server was very friendly and quickly got our coffee.  The menu has a large variety of items but I wanted something small as we had lunch plans with friends.  I opted for oatmeal.  She asked what I wanted with it.  Everywhere I get oatmeal it comes with brown sugar, raisins and milk.   I asked for brown sugar and skim milk.   She wasn't sure about skim milk but I said whatever is there is fine.   I won't go into the story about my husbands egg sandwich because he writes his own reviews, but it was interesting.    My oatmeal arrived, nice and hot.   She had sprinkled the brown sugar on top and said \"I wasn't sure how much you wanted\".  Normally it comes in a side dish so I can add what I want.   That was weird.  No milk was delivered so I asked for the milk.  It eventually came, in a small glass.  Again this was weird as it is always in a small pitcher.  The oatmeal was good and the serving was large.  I would maybe come again and try something different as I liked the atmosphere and the varied menu.",

For pasta sides: only marinara sauce is free. Every other side costs $1.50  For soups as a side: french onion soup costs extra  My first time I was here they didn't say there was any price difference nor the second. The first time my dad paid and i didn't realize we were charged a higher price. The second time i paid so i noticed so i asked and then she told me but at this point it was after i ate so i had to pay the difference. i think if your sides cost extra you should explicitly say that when the customer is ordering. I loved the food but this rubbed me the wrong way so i don't know if i'd go back.",

I ended up choosing the spinach salad with grilled chicken (a great decision).  The salad was very good.  I, also, noticed dishes brought to other tables that looked really hood (such as burger).  The portion sizes for the menu items are very generous.  In addition, the entire staff was very polite and considerate.  For example, my waitress saw I was having difficulty deciding between the two salad dressings so she brought them both to the table.  She, also, helped me customize my salad to accommodate my allergies and food preferences.  The restaurant's atmosphere was refreshing.  It combined the traditional diner experience with a slightly upscale touch.  I would highly recommend them to anyone.",

    "text": "Up until recently we loved this place but we've noticed the quality of food is diminishing.  The managers don't seem to care when the customer has an issue even though tonight she stopped at our table.  So tonight we ordered deluxe burgers and on their menu it specifically says, Includes french fries, onion rings lettuce & tomato. So I specified I wanted onion rings but then saw I was charged $2 for them.  I brought this to the cashiers attention to be told no it says upcharge. So I grabbed a menu and read it over 10x and it states, includes french fries, onion rings. Apparently the includes onion rings wording is meant to say onion rings on the burger included but doesn't even come close to saying that.  So the manager got involved as I got louder and she stated it was worded correctly.. So I proceeded to tell her for a $2 onion ring I'll eat elsewhere if my business isn't appreciated. She stated that was fine.  So with that said this is an ongoing issue with this place as they used to advertise stuffed peppers and indeed served 2 peppers to lately switch to one but kept the menu board as peppers.. after my complaints the board now says pepper.   False advertising and disregard for customers is a bad menu for success. Good luck Central but as I promised I'm done with your gadget words.",

    "text": "If you're in the Robinson area and looking for a good, family-friendly restaurant with a classic diner feel, Central Diner & Grille is the perfect choice. They have breakfast, lunch, dinner, and are open late (11PM on weekdays and 1AM on weekends). I've been to Central twice now, and I've had good experiences each time.  Both times that I came to Central were with parties of at least 10+ people. My family doesn't go out together often, but when we do it's big time! The first time must have left a good impression on everyone, because when we were recently in search of a restaurant to go to before my out-of-town uncle returned home it was a no brainier to come back to Central.  Usually when I go out to eat I have a good idea of what I'm in the mood for, but on the evening of my last visit I was feeling particularly indecisive. I was thinking I wanted the spanakopita up until the very last minute, and then I decided on the eggplant parm. After Christmas I felt super weighed down by tons of carb-filled foods, so this wasn't a bad option. With your entree you get a choice of soup or salad to start off, and without thinking twice I opted for the salad with Greek dressing. My mom got the daily soup, which was beef vegetable, and it looked incredible, though.  For being with such a large amount of people, our order came out impressively fast. My serving of eggplant parm was overwhelmingly huge, but I mean this in the best way possible. It had the perfect amount of sauce and cheese on top, and was fried to a perfect crisp. I had enough for at least 2 other meals after eating to my stomach's content, and it was just as good heated up the next day as my lunch.  It's not quite a tradition, but I'm happy that when we go out together my family chooses to go to Central. With two good experiences here I can confidently recommend it to others and say that I'll be happy when we decide to come back. Trying brunch here is definitely on my list along with other things I saw on their menu, but that gives me something to look forward to!",

The place was packed tonight but we got a table right away. You'll notice a fully stocked bar right as you walk in, not what I was expecting from a diner. Our waitress (Paola) was wonderful, super friendly and on top of things. The menu is enormous and they have plenty of specials, it's honestly a little overwhelming. Prices are great. I had the California Burger and I was surprised with a pickle and large bowl of coleslaw to start. For better or worse, the portions at this place are huge. The burger was good but not great, they appear to use frozen patties. Someone I was with had the eggplant parmesan, she said it was great but was probably enough to feed three people. Overall, worth a visit for sure.",

Central always is a winner because they do not have time limits on when you can order breakfast. Maybe I want eggs at 6pm!!! Who are you to tell me I can't?!  The staff is kind and pleasant. I have never had a bad experience here! They also serve alcohol if you wanna turn it up a notch.   The only issue is that the area where you pay is also where you wait to be seated. So if there is a long line to pay and also a line to be seated, this is a recipe for a congested area. Other than that- Central is great! Come for breakfast, come for lunch, come for dinner and then maybe come back for dessert too!",

Even though the table of 12 was seated before us, our waitress took  our order first. Food came out quickly, and was good. Ex large portions mask the higher pricing but was fair for the portion size. Overall a good experience especially once the table of 12 had food in their mouth and we could finally hear ourselves talk :-)",

I got pancakes it was a huge portion that looked delicious but wasn't good at all they were dry and chalky I tried to Drench them in syrup but they only have little packets of syrup the home fries were cold, the toast had a oily butter and the eggs were watery. I was amazed on how bad the food actually was. It was my first and last time that I will be going to central.",

    "text": "Alright. . . ticking off the list:  1)  Nice atmosphere 2)  Good service 3)  meh food  It's new, and pretty, and while it's a \"diner\", it's a diner that was built in the last three months, so the decor is pretty sweet, everything is all clean and gleaming brushed stainless and muted colors.  No patina of cigarette smoke and coffee stains, like the tried and True diners of old.  Which is a good thing.  The service was good, I don't recall her being particularly knowledgeable, but how knowledgeable could she have been since we ate there two weeks after they opened?  I also don't remember her being NOT knowledgeable.  So. . . YAY!  Now for the bad. . .   I ordered a reuben.  My friend remarked that it's hard to find a place that has a good reuben.  I didn't necessarily agree, but said nothing.  We both got it.  We were both surprised to see it served open face, which, upon asking the manager (we'll come back to him in a minute) was because, \"It's the chef's interpretation of a reuben.  He wanted to make it unique.\"    It WAS unique.  But unique in a way that sucked.  Like if the chef interpreted a hot dog by saying, \"HERE we serve our hot dogs with the mustard in your hand instead of on the dog. \"  It was a stupid interpretation.  Messy.  And not good.  Because the sauerkraut was kind of slippery, and the cheese was kind of melty, and the dressing was very heavy handed, so when you used your knife to cut it you ended up with half the sandwich still on the plate because it wouldn't stick on the fork, so you had a bite of cheese and dressing, then went back for a bite of bread and saurkraut and meat.  It was sloppy and I ended up scooping most of the dressing onto the side of the plate so it was tolerable.  And on the plus side there was a lot of food. . . but the negative of that was it was really hard to cut without food dropping off the side of the plate while you sawed at the sandwich through the meat.    So then the manager came to our table, which I generally liked, but he was so aggressively wanting to nip any issues in the bud that he came across a little. . . militantly servile.  \"Did everything exceed your expectations?\" he asked.  Then when our grunts of polite assent didn't suffice, he addressed each of us individually. . . it was uncomfortable.  I just wanted to be left to eat my shitty sandwich in peace.  I felt uncomfortable complaining about my shitty sandwich, because it was, of course, ON PURPOSE.  Did it exceed my expectations?  No!  But I didn't really want to interrupt my meal to have a discussion about it.  I bought his departure by saying that I didn't really have any expectations coming in, so I couldn't really judge whether they'd been exceeded.  Which was a lie.  When we paid our bill. . . the manager was at the cash register. . . eagerly waiting to ask, once more, \"Did your experience exceed your expectations?\"  UGGGGHHHH!  I just wanted to leave.  \"I don't know, yes. . . yes, it was fine!\"    Ultimately, I will return.  It was really close to work, and it's my own fault for not reading that they serve the reuben open faced.  I assume it's on the menu that way.  And next time I'll just tell the manager to go away because he's bothering me, which is more my speed. . . I was just caught a little off guard.  If my next experience is. . . better (which will exceed my expectations) I'll update my review and add a star or two to it.  Until then though. . . it was \"meh\".  Diner food.",

It had the greasy down pat but was not the silver spoon as another yelper reported.  I love Greek but did not have the confidence to order it here.  When the staff pronounces Gyro with a soft \"G\" instead of a \"Y\" as in year-o the authenticity is shot.  I opted for the diner food... potato skins, one of the four halves was still cold in the middle.  I followed that with the buffalo burger...no it's not buffalo but has a little buffalo sauce on top-more on the table for those who want to actually taste it.  The blue cheese was generous, the onions grilled well and the burger a previously frozen patty that was gray all the way through-a far cry from the medium I ordered.  Our server was quite pleasant, we sat outside which was nice as it was freezing inside.  I won't be back, too many other options.",

The atmosphere was pretty much what you would expect for this style of resturant although the temperature control could have been better (it was freezing in there).     However when it came to the food, It was not great at all.  We ordered an omelet with broccoli and instead of hash browns my partner got Fries that he gave to me and he wanted Mellon which they offered in their menu as a side to the omelet.  First they didn't have the Mellon which was a bummer, then when we get our meals they seemed tough and barely edible.  My pancakes where ok but its not hard to make pancake batter out of something like Bisquick or some knock off.  The Sausage that came with my meal was horrendous, the bacon didn't even resemble bacon, the syrup they brought was pre-packaged Smuckers syrup (so i cant really blame them too much for how bad that was other then the choice of syrup but what ever) and the toast was pretty much stone cold.     Then I tried the fries that came with his meal, they tasted as if they had been fried in burnt grease.  Any one who has ever worked in fast food/ refreshments probably knows what I'm talking about.  Heck even if you have eaten at a McDonalds that hasn't changed their grease often enough you know what I mean.      I don't know if the place was having a bad night or not but for our first time there, It will probably be our last.",

    "text": "This place in general has great all day breakfast, lunch, and dinner options with a Greek/Mediterranean twist. Writing this now, I've been here more than once to try their omelettes (specifically the Big Fat Greek Omelette & Nova Scotia Lox/Onion Omelette), waffles, pasta (Pasta Fra Diavolo), appetizers (fried calamari), and soup (French onion) and found all of them to be quite delicious. This place can definitely get busy during evenings and weekends so be prepared if you are coming at any of these times. Specifically in regards to the food, I found the ingredients in all the omelettes to be quite fresh. The calamari is also authentic, which is much appreciated, seeing as most places do not use real calamari when they offer it. The waffles are also quite delicious too ... the one I ordered was one with strawberries, bananas, laced with honey and it was probably one of the best waffles I've had. The soup was also quite flavorful and filling ... not too salty, but also with enough flavor to leave one satisfied. Overall, I'm impressed at their offerings along with good, quick, friendly, and efficient service. Prices can be higher for the pasta, seafood, and specialty (Italian and Greek) dishes so consider yourself warned ahead of time. It can also be quite loud during busy times so it may not be the most ideal for quiet meetups if that is what one is looking for. Overall, a great choice of diner for all-day breakfast, lunch, or dinner although it's a little bit of a drive from the city itself. Would recommend.",

Since I'm Greek, I've had a lot of Greek food. At most restaurants, Greek food means throwing feta cheese and olives on a tossed salad. I can say with some some authority that the Greek food here is excellent. The Village Salad is perfect and sloppy, so make sure you get some bread to soak it up. I was impressed with their Avgolemono soup (egg-lemon soup with chicken stock), which had a unique creaminess that made it a step above. We also had spanakopita, which was crunchy and had a fresh spinach taste, and the calamari, which had a nice seasoned breading and perfectly fried, As for the portions, they are leftover sized. The steak was over 20oz, the breaded chicken was two huge boneless breasts (where do you get chicken that big?), and the fillet of sole was two big cuts of fish. I think we took more food home then we ate there! While I haven't tried it yet, I understand the breakfast is also amazing, so I'll be coming back for sure to try that. As for the prices, they are slightly higher then you'd expect at a diner, but the portions and quality are above the price, and the term \"diner\" is loosely used here.  I can't wait to go back- Opa!",

I come here for lunches a lot of the time as I work in the area. Soups are very good, if on the salty side. Wedding and beef vegetable are standouts. Sandwiches and fries are huge - I usually take half home (and I can eat a lot!). Greek specialties like moussaka are delicious and a nice addition to the area's offerings. You MUST try the homemade baklava. When in the Robinson area, please give these locals a try before going to Applebee's or Panera again.",

Everything looked great, but I opted for the 2 egg breakfast w/ sausage and rye toast with a side of the French toast. Man, I'm stuffed but it was all excellent. It's difficult to take a diner breakfast and elevate it beyond \"good\", but they really pull it off here. Eggs were obviously fresh and perfectly cooked, sausage was just a step above your normal sausage link in quality and flavor, and the French Toast was just superb. I just wish I still had room for the baklava, it looks awesome.",

Everything was exceptionally fresh, flavored and cooked. Some of the best Greek dressing I have ever had - I asked for more to eat with my fries. The lady across from us had one of their triple decker sandwiches, another guy had the Reuben and the creamiest looking coleslaw. I wanted everything I saw! This will be one of our weekly go tos on date night! Wonderful service, food and atmosphere - one of the best restaurants in the greater Pittsburgh area - hands down.",

A clean, friendly, family oriented establishment that consists of a very hard working staff and very friendly Management (owner) that seems to always be on the floor assisting their staff the whole time.  From breakfast, to lunch, to dinner, all portions are very generous and the prices are very affordable.  Greek food with a Southern flair, but the menu consists of food that will please everybody for sure.  Great for adults, and if you bring your children, realize that the food portions are ridiculously big on the kids menu.  Remember to come to this restaurant with an empty stomach and if you see a line please refrain from wondering if it is worth the wait, it definitely is.  If this is your first time dining with Central Diner and Grille you'll more than likely be dining there in the future again and again due to the numerous items on the menu you'll want to try.    Last but not least, DO NOT forget DESSERT.  We actually made a stop here one night because we wanted something sweet to eat and left full as if we had another meal.  Once you have the dessert, please remember to order one of their gigantic cakes to go.",

Often restaurants that have this much selection have too much going on and just can't make anything well; not \"The Diner\". Priced well and generous portions. This place is great for burgers, breakfast, or seafood. They often have an unusual take on dishes so be sure to point out if there are any ingredients you just can't eat - peppers in the Cordon Bleu.",

    "text": "Horrible experience. I ordered the Monte Cristo sandwich and asked if I could have fries instead of coleslaw. I would've gladly paid an up-charge as every other restaurant I've ever been to has allowed me to do. The waitress told me this was absolutely impossible and if I wanted a different side I'd have to pay full price. I was unwilling to pay $3.00 for an additional side when I was already getting a side, even if I didn't want it. The waitress messed up my friend's order despite my friend repeating it several times. When our meal was finally over and she brought the check, the waitress stared at us (I assume trying to encourage us to hurry up and pay) until she finally decided to take our payment instead of us going to the counter to pay. That seemed very courteous until she stood at the table while we tipped and signed the check. I and both of my friends were very uncomfortable. I read great reviews and was very hopeful about going to this restaurant for the first time, but of my whole meal I was only able to eat half my sandwich. Of course I won't return somewhere that won't let me have what I want to eat and then tops it off with poor service. I recommend going elsewhere if you dislike coleslaw as much as I do, because you can't have anything else and it comes with most meals",

    "text": "Great place to take anyone with A big enough appetite. My friends and I decided to stop here after a movie. I had never been to the diner so I figured hey At least they have a vast menu and they serve breakfast all day.  We were seated right away in a booth which was very comfortable and large. Our waiter Aaron was a great at his job and was really accommodating especially for my friend who's very picky about what she eats. He was able to make me a virgin mint julep which tasted great!!   I ordered the Greek eggs Benedict with a Greek side salad. The dressing on the salad is definitely the best that I've ever tasted. When my eggs Benedict came out the chunks of Gyro meat that were on them were humongous. Of course I couldn't eat it all because the English muffin was twice as big as what I'm used too. The Gyro meat was very flavorful and juicy the eggs were cooked perfectly and the hollandaise sauce just added that perfect creamy touch to the top. My husband ordered the veal Parmesan which was actually pretty decent. The marinara sauce they use is made in house and has small chunks of tomato in there so you know it's fresh.   Our friends ordered a chef salad along with an omelette both of which were very filling. The salad alone came in this large bowl that was big enough for about four people to eat.   After dinner we ordered a slice of one of their various cakes, it was mango and raspberry filled. I wasn't too thrilled about the cake, the bread was kind of dense and maybe on the dry side. I think next time I might skip dessert or try their rice pudding instead.   All in all this is a great place to take your family or friends when you're not sure what to eat. The menu is large enough to accommodate anyone's  tastebuds from from Italian to Greek to American they pretty much have it all.",

Nice friendly people, excellent food, good prices, portions are plenty for you, etc.  Then just last week I was traveling in the same area and just had to return to Central Diner and I'm glad I did!  Waiter Seth was ultra attentive and fast, and I loved the salmon special, plus a nice glass of Cabernet.  Try this place - you'll be glad you did!",

Coolest thing was the inside- it was extremely cold I remember, but other Than that looked mad modern- probably the nicest diner I've been to!   Menu was extremely diverse, they seemed to have a Mediterranean influence in the menu, which was good because I love em Mediterranean spices!   I got the Mediterranean chicken, man was it plentiful! Lots of chicken- I thought it may have been a little well done- but nonetheless the dish was pretty magnificent and grand- came with a side of steamed broccoli to be healthy.   I wanted some cake, which they had a TON of but cut myself off at this point because I wasn't sure if I can walk.   Service was pretty good, little pricey but you get your money's worth.  Will return.",

I asked for more honey for my yogurt and they didn't charge for it.  Coffee tasty too.  Clean clean clean, a couple of servers were busy wiping windows, doors, glass desert windows.  ( and the cakes looked yummy!) Bathrooms were spotless.  The decor was contemporary and they had booths tables and a bar-type counter.  Chef came out and asked how everything was.  We had to wrap half each to take with us.  So I give this place the best rating.  If someone did not have a good experience here it was probably a rarity, although.....

We were skeptical but decided to wait.  Well, it was about 8-10 minutes and rest assured we were in our seats!  Our waitress was very nice and quick with everything.  The food was great and there was a lot of it!  My only complaint would be the environment was a little rushed.  It had a (the owner knows how to run a restaurant and make money) New York restaurant feel: fast and furious!  BUT, I do respect how this guy runs his business!  Darn good food, lots of it and you're in and out!  I love this place and we will be back!  if you can handle New York speed, great food and a good portions, you will love this place too!

I frequent Central Diner & Grille not only for its conveniently close location to my home but they are welcoming as soon as you walk  through the door. I've dined in and ordered take out with no complaints. The menu is large but you can order breakfast anytime. I recommend if ordering takeout to stick to lunch and dinner items. My personal preference is that when ordering breakfast food, its always best when being served. I love the veggie omelet, followed by the Vegetable Panini.  Want a salad? Pick the Greek salad! Its served with stuffed grape leaves and pita, topped with feta and Kalamata olives.. YUM! Meat eating fiance has enjoyed the cuban and the roast beef sandwich with the hot gravy.

Not wanting to stop at one of the many chain restaurants in the Robinson area we decided to try this place for the first time. Calling it's a diner is a little misleading, it feels like a upscale sitdown restaurant that happens to have booths and a counter.   The menu is divided from classic American to Mediterranean Greek food. I chose to have the Gyro platter, which was a Gyro sandwich broke up into a salad served with as much great Greek dressing as I could ever want.  Everyone at the table decided to have something different so we had orders of fries, burgers and Panini's. To be honest there was not much talk about the food because everybody was too busy eating. The portion sizes are humongous and everyone had food to take home. I truly believe that this is one of the best deals as far as portion sizes in the city. All in all great service, taste and portion sizes.  My only problem with the restaurant was that it was loud. We have a unique situation with having an autistic son who is overwhelmed by too much noise. We did Ask be moved in they placed us in a quieter corner. It really helped and our son was able to relax and eat his meal. I cannot say thank you enough for doing that for us.  We will be back in this possibly could be our restaurant of choice in Robinson all the time.",

There eggs whether you get them scrambled or over easy are cooked to perfection. Not to mention the reasonable prices and big portions. This is for sure a place where you get your bang for your buck. This morning in particular, I got coffee, 2 eggs, home fries and toast all for $7.25, not a bad deal at all. The service is great and everyone is super friendly. The only negative I have to say is the home fries are  a bit bland, but I'm sure if you were a ketchup person you wouldn't even notice. Also, I think their coffee could be better. They exceed immensely in all other categories though and I hate even saying a negative, but just wanted to get that out there.   If they improved their coffee and even added more selections dealing with coffee additions and such, I would give 5 stars. Other than that, I would very much so pick this restaurant over any chain breakfast place. AMAZING SERVICE AND ATTENTIVE STAFF.",

We asked the waitress about the sour taste and she replied that she had no idea and didn't intend on asking for us. My sister's steak was mediocre, slightly burnt and her waffle fries were Costco frozen quality. Our salmon wasn't seasoned at all, not even salt. On the contrary, my French onion soup was so salty I couldn't eat it. After seeing that I didn't eat my French onion soup, our waitress (I don't know her name because she didn't take the time to inform us) snarkily let us know that her daughter had expensive taste just like me, but unlike me, her daughter actually ate the food she paid for..... It's not my fault their soup is saltier than the Dead Sea. The portions are large here, so if you do come here, consider sharing a meal. Last negative thing.... Three entrees and a $2 upcharge for french onion soup equaled $70.... We didn't even have drinks or desserts... Incredibly overpriced, bland/ as salty as Vegimite, and rude waitress. We won't be coming back.",

    "text": "Overall I liked Central Diner.  The menu offers a lot of options and the owner is very attentive to his customers.  I had the Sliced London Broil Sandwich with fries.  The sandwich was delicious but for the price a few more slices of meat wouldn't have hurt.  The fries were of the battered variety, which I am not a fan of even though I am finding them at more and more restaurants.  For dessert, I went with the rich Chocolate Layer Cake.  It was okay, but I think I really should have gone for the cheesecake.  The building itself used to be a Denny's, so it feels more like your typical casual dining restaurant and less like a diner.  Also, when the place is even a little busy the noise level reaches high levels.  Our waitress could have checked on us a bit more.  I had to go to the front counter because I got tired of waiting for her to ask if we needed anything else.  I struggled with 2 or 3 stars.  My bill, with tip, was $20.  This seemed steep to me (especially when my drink was water).  I think the price is the biggest obstacle I have in really liking Central Diner.  But I would like to go back for breakfast so ultimately I landed on 3 stars.  We'll see if the rating goes up after another visit.",

This place is clean, and looks like a NJ diner ++ Even the menu is the same, with Greek specialties abounding.  * Dinner Portions are HUGE.  My Mom got Moussaka.  Besides being incredibly tasty, there was so much that it was almost falling off the plate.  *  Full bar.  Thank god.  GOOD:  * The service.  Not great, but not bad.  We did feel at the end that our waitress was rushing us - but, in her favor, it was the end of the night.  IMPROVEMENT:  * Dessert.  They had no non-chocolate cake options.  They had 5 half-eaten chocolate cakes in the display. The manager did tell us that he had 8 cakes coming in the next day, but it may be a sign to stock more vanilla cake options if you're completely out of them and still have all of your chocolate cakes left in the fridge.  This is so much like a NJ/NYC/Philly diner that I'm judging based upon what I'm used to - and the bakery just didn't measure up.      * Pepsi not Coke.  For the love of god, you have to serve Coca-Cola products in a diner.  Or, at least have it as a bottled option.  Pepsi is not the same.  I will never order a Pepsi-float.  * General descriptions.  I ordered the \"Cuban Panini\".  It wasn't what I was expecting.  When making a Cuban, the bread is brushed with butter or olive oil and then grilled.   The bread on this sandwich was more toasted than grilled and there was no olive oil or butter.  The end result was fluffier and less melt-in-your-mouth than I'd expect of a Cuban sandwich.  The kitchen was also pretty heavy handed on the mustard.  SUMMARY - I will definitely be back.  Maybe it was just an off night.  Overall, I got a great vibe from this place.  The food just didn't meet my expectations this time.",

I had the Nutella Pancake special and it was so decadent. And such a huge portion!   We had reservations but still had to wait a bit because it was so busy for a holiday. It was worth the wait. The menu is extensive and everyone enjoyed their meals. For breakfasts out I always ask for toast before the rest of the meal comes out to keep my year old son occupied. Often the wait staff forgets, but not here. It was brought out right away. I really appreciate that.

Decent coffee and an extra benefit of cocktails and wine, if that's what you're into.   Where I suppose I was disappointed was the food. The portions were REALLY generous, but the foodie in me wanted something that put a spin on an old concept.   I ordered the eggs Benedict. Did I ever mention that I LOVE eggs Benedict? If not, then here it is. The English muffin was bland, the ham was eh, and the eggs were PERFECT. 1/3. Here's where it all crashed to hell-the cheap hollandaise sauce...the CUP of cheap hollandaise sauce that drenched the eggs. It was so much, I was gently scraping it off the eggs to save that poached pocket of goodness.   All else was standard diner quality, I suppose-home fries, bacon, my husband's pancakes...  I will go back for another meal, I think, just to give their creations a try. Maybe the specialties are what keeps this place kicking.",

    "text": "I've only eaten here once, but this seems like typical diner fare that's playing dress up. Big portions and no frills items are the standard here, and the food and menu would be more at home in an establishment with a counter rather than one with a foyer and a chalkboard advertising $17 dinners. To be honest I'd give this place a 3.5 if possible, because there's nothing actually wrong with the restaurant, or the food, or the service....I'm just not in any hurry to go back.   If you like a lot of food this is the place to go. The French onion soup was the True highlight of the meal, and I could've gotten away with just eating that. I really love French onion, and the broth was 7/10 with the cheese 5/10, but it's extremely difficult to find good French onion and almost impossible to find the authentic kind, so for me this is a decent rating. If I go back I will 100% get this again, and perhaps try a piece of cake.   I ordered the turkey club wrap. I was pleasantly surprised to find this included REAL turkey, not the lunch meat variety. The wrap was big enough that I took half home and it made a decent meal the next day. The wrap did not include cheese or mayo like a typical club, and as such it was rather bland. The fries were frozen fries that come in a bag, so I was disappointed in that.   Boyfriend got the Greek omelette, which was quite tasty, and came with homefries and toast. I guess if you really like diners than you will like the food here. I was hoping for a bit more, (flavor-wise, not quantity) and rather shocked at some of the prices ($5.95 for two eggs??? Really??). Not a bad meal by any means, but not memorable either.",

    "text": "It was the logical and logistical choice to dine here. I mean, all the stars were aligned pretty much - at least the yelp rating was anyway. 4.5 stars in the average rating and right next door to my hotel - Red Roof Inn Plus+.   How could I say no?   Central Diner & Grille was exactly that and more. It was definitely a full-fledged diner and restaurant. I got a event that it was pretty nice inside and and accommodate many many people for a big party or a small gathering. They are pretty much a 24 hour operation because they serve breakfast, lunch, dinner, and even can satisfy late night munchies. They probably serve breakfast all day and night, but you just need to ask whether not they do so. I arrived here on a Tuesday late September evening around 8:30pm. It wasn't crowded and I got seated right away. I was offered the dining area or up front at the bar. I opted for the dining area and sat in a booth. It was nice to have plenty of space for the food and drink. The service here was as good as you can get. Friendly and quite nice for any meal combination that you require for that specific moment in time. I suspect that they get a lot of people for dinner and late night, since they have a full bar going on and the selection of beers is pretty good. While they don't have anything on tap, they sell bottled beers. The overall experience here at Central Diner & Grille was just dinner and it was pretty good. The ambiance of casual was nice and just dining in a quiet setting was enjoyable.   I must have spent about 45 minutes here from start to finish. Starting out with a Heineken was a nice way to end the day driving from Winchester, VA to here near the Pittsburgh airport area and Central Diner & Grille. The Central Diner & Grille is located at 6408 Steubenville Pike in Pittsburgh. They accept major credit cards, which is always a good thing. Since I was staying next door at the Red Roof Inn Plus+, I didn't need to worry about parking issues, but for the many other patrons here who don't, there is plenty of parking here around the restaurant. The menu at the Central Diner and Grille was quite extensive, half of it went to breakfast and the other half was dedicated to the lunch/dinner menu, along with drinks, desserts, and other side dishes that would make any meal that much more satisfying. For me, this was just dinner and I spent about $20 for everything. It was sort of like dining at a Chili's restaurant though, although they have a nice breakfast selection. Prices here are quite the norm of what you'd find anywhere. $5-6 for breakfast and $10 for lunch entrees. Liquor and beers range from $3 - $6, although I don't know if they have happy hour here or not.  My experience here at Central Diner & Grille is as affordable and delectable as one can imagine it to be. I started off with the aforementioned Heineken. I ordered this mushroom burger, which came with cheese and sauteed mushrooms and onions. I had French fries that came with it, also I ordered a round of corned beef hash, since I haven't had corned beef hash (restaurant style, not canned supermarket style) in a while. The burger itself was great and I ordered it medium rare. It was quite juicy and the bun was soft enough to where it just melted in my mouth. It was just the ideal meal to have after a long day of driving in the mid Atlantic. The French fries were crisp and hot, while the corned beef hash was definitely hits the spot, especially when I haven't had it in so long. It brought back memories from my childhood and that was very very nostalgic for me. If you are in the area and want a good homespun meal, check this place out and you may be surprised on what hidden gems and treats you'd find here at the Central Diner & Grille.  4.0 stars for service and good food. 4.5 stars for the ambiance. The restaurant is very clean and optimized for everyday service.  Support local!  B++",

    "text": "A middle of the road diner where what' on the menu is hit or miss.  Their greek spinach pie is pretty good and other meals seem to be \"diner\" like volume.  The peppering of olive oil with True native fare is a bit disappointing as it seems that as always olive oil is a substitute for things of the past which don't fit well in a diner type environment.  If this property makes a bit of an effort it may prove to be an interesting opportunity to revisit in a future review and improve their score.",

They have cakes in the display case at the entrance that looked amazing! Would like to try one of those one day if we make it back here. We were seated immediately and asked if we preferred a booth or table. Of course we said booth, but if I go back I will sit at a table. The booths are very confined and the seats are very upright and uncomfortable!  Our server Angela was very friendly and helped guide me through the menu letting me know the most popular items from each section. We went with 2 of her suggestions, the Cuban Panini and the Gyro. My panini was satisfactory, nothing extraordinary but very good. It was large enough I brought have of it plus half my sweet potato fries home for later. The sweet potato fries and onion rings are a dollar upcharge. My husband went with the Gyro. Wow. Huge! He said it was spectacular, although he did say he would like more tzatziki sauce on it, maybe ask if they'll bring more on the side for you. All in all the prices were decent and the serving sizes were very big. They even had a 10% military discount. Thank you.",

    "text": "Now this was a birthday breakfast/brunch outing. We were in Robinson to get our car looked at and the man found this place on Yelp. The reviews looked good so we took the plunge. We got seated quickly and they even accommodated my foot (it is in a walking boot). I really appreciated them seeing that and realizing that sitting me close and not making me walk around would be really nice.   The waitress was exceptional. Seriously. We wanted OJ but wanted to split it, she got us two glasses, Chris didn't like the sides, she made an accommodation since she saw his hesitation. It was awesome. She came around to check on us and chat, but wasn't overbearing and in the way. I loved her.  I ordered the Greek Eggs Benedict with the side of home fries. I ordered the home fries extra crispy. This sometimes is where the restaurants fail. You say crispy and they think, \"eh, she can't really mean that.\" Oh but I do. The home fries came out perfect. The reason that they do not get four stars and only three is because of the meat on the Greek Eggs Benedict. I saw them put the new spit of \"meat\" on while I was sitting there. I knew at that time that the meat on my food would be the leftover crunchies or just dry, and I was right. Some pieces were good, others were super old tasting (crunchy and dry). The meal would have been perfect, but that meat was a no go.   They were saved from the dreaded two stars by the fact that they gave me a free piece of cake for my birthday that looks amazing and is huge. I would like to do 3.5 stars but that is not allowed.",

We called the server said we aren't too busy (we asked) we were on our way As my boyfriend parked the car I went in and sat at our seats What happened next was appalling Apparently your host Marybeth who isn't very friendly to begin with came to my table obviously angry asking me who sat me? Umm we called and had Kelly pour our coffee of which she knew that already apparently But even if that hadn't happened was she going to ask me to get up? Guests make that mistake often especially on the side of counters  To which she angrily huffed her way back to the host stand and continued with a stare down our entire visit Seriously needs a attitude replacement Kelly and Kelly offer the best customer service always Its a shame your host doesn't learn more from them",

    "text": "Overall Impression: 4.5 Home-style cooking with generous portions that has something for everyone in the family.  The Food: Let me tell you about the specials board, because it's where it's at! The restaurant is owned by Greek family who specializes in Mediterranean and Greek dishes, and there is definitely plentiful options when it comes to that cuisine. I ordered a classic from the specials board when I was there--a stuffed pepper with mashed potatoes; one of the ultimate comfort foods and one of my favorites as a child. It did not disappoint! Not only was it huge, but it was covered in a delicious tomato sauce and cooked perfectly. There's nothing like a fountain of stuffed pepper sauce spilling over into a mountain of creamy mashed potatoes. I couldn't even finish the whole thing--I took half home for my boyfriend to eat, and he enjoyed it just as much as I did. I've also enjoyed their Buffalo Chicken Salad, which was HUGE and definitely hit my buffalo chicken cravings at the core.  The Restaurant: On our last visit we sat outside in the middle of winter. How? They have huge enclosed heaters in the middle of each outdoor section that really do have the feeling of a fireplace. The inside of the restaurant is generally very noisy, as they usually have big parties and families (kids screaming combined with older people hard of hearing), but as long as you don't mind that, everything else is fine. I know in the past they failed a health inspection, but they're clean on the floor. There is always a wait on the weekends because of their popularity, and that attests to their focus on a quality home-cooked meal. Finding a parking spot is difficult because of how many people go there. The servers are friendly and very on their toes due to their volume of customers and are very quick to grab anything you need. Their owners are hands-on and are all over the place when I'm there, attending to everyone's tables and asking everyone if their enjoying their experience.  TL;DR If you had a bad day and need some amazing comfort food in your life or want a huge meal for a reasonable price, this is the place to go. Their diverse menu that pairs classical home-cooked meals with Greek flare has everyone west of Pittsburgh coming to eat there, and you should too.",

The menu had a very good selection. The food came out at a normal speed and it was delicious. And you get a ton of food for your money. I could hardly finish my omelet . I got the Italian omelet which had a ton of cheese green peppers and sausage also came with a side of home fries. The home fries where thin sliced potatoes seasoned perfectly that came right off the griddle. Best breakfast in a while. Will be going back.",

    "text": "Central Diner is the kind of concept that you find frequently in places like New Jersey, but that is sorely missing from the Pittsburgh area. It has a HUGE menu with all kinds of variants on Italian, Greek, and American dishes. The place itself is quite large, and the vibe is terrific. However, things can go wrong with this format and we had a not-so-great experience during a recent visit.  It was a Saturday night and we expected a bit of a wait. The waiting area was pretty crowded and we could see that every table was full, so when we were told 15-20 minute wait, we eagerly accepted. It was just about that long before the table was ready for us and in the meantime we were entertained by people watching and seeing how the diminutive hostess handled the crush of people.  Out table was towards the back of the restaurant and along the way we had to dodge several waitstaff scurrying about with full or empty plates. When we sat down, we noticed that there were not enough sets of flatware. Unfortunately, the hostess ran off as soon as she showed us the table, so we could not ask her to fix this issue. We waited, and a few minutes later, a tiny waitress (not everyone there was small, just these two people who happened to work our party, I swear! Nor, are we that LARGE!!!) showed up with glasses of water. She dropped them off, and before we could say anything, she turned around and was gone.  She came back a few minutes later to take our orders. We asked for the flatware and she told us that was the job of the front desk, in an annoyed tone. What were we supposed to do? Anyway, we repeated our request so she marched off and spoke to someone else. He (normal-sized person!) brought us the necessary utensils but would not take orders or answer questions as he turned out to be one of the busboys.  A few more minutes and out tiny waitress came back. Fake smile on her face she asked what we wanted. We asked if there were any specials? She pointed to a board by the front desk ... and disappeared again!  More minutes pass be and she's back. We gave her our orders ... and poof! ... gone again.  Ten minutes pass by and she's back with a plate of bread and some butter in packets. Drops that off, and runs away. By this time, at least one of the water glasses is completely empty... I won't bore you with the whole story as you see the trend. By the way, I do not blame her. As we watched, she was running from kitchen to tables and back. She was constantly busy. She obviously needed help to take care of as many tables as she had, but everyone on the staff seemed quite as busy so this was probably a management issue, not a waitress problem.  Eventually our food arrived. The verdict on it was mixed. The Salmon and Crab Cake entree was superb; the Shepherd's Pie was pedestrian; the Chicken Souvlaki was bad (the chicken was obviously cooked on a skillet - not a skewer, and the peppers and onions were raw and placed on top of the cooked chicken). The side salads were boring; the dressings were watered down. The whole experience was mixed.  I am not sure if we'll come back. Maybe at a time when they are not so rushed they can spend more time to make the dishes properly?",

It is a glorified diner featuring a full menu of home made tasting dishes, soups, sandwiches and desserts.    The selections are fantastic and the portions are huge.  They have daily features which include comfort foods to the max!  Stuffed peppers, meatloaf, beef tips and rice are just a few of the offerings. Breakfast is served all day and the menu looked amazing. I was very pleased with their homemade goodness and plan to visit again soon. They also offer wine and spirits.  . .",

There's an outdoor, covered patio and they brought a bowl of water for the pup. The waitstaff was excellent, even though we had to change seats due to the blinding sun on one side of the patio, they were very understanding and accommodating, patient too.  My huband ate here more than the rest of us because he gets up earlier and is a breakfast eater. The food was consistently delicious each time. His go to was sausage and waffle. The time we ate dinner here I had a salad sampler trio with egg, chicken, and tuna salad all on ine plate. The serving was generous enough that I made a sandwich from it the next day. My husband got the roast beef which was delicious and fork tender. My daughter got the kids pasta with meat sauce which also ended up being her lunch the next day.  Prices were reasonable, food was great - with generous portions, service was friendly and helpful. Would definitely return if given the opportunity.",

It came on an open faced small hamburger bun cooked medium well, grilled not seared on both sides.  Additionally it was covered in a dry Italian seasoning heavy on the thyme.  I also added cheese to my fries, for my $1 up charge I got about a quarters worth of sprinkled cheese.  Wife got the London broil sandwich, rare, on a garlic roll.  Same hamburger bun, also way over cooked, same overpowering Italian seasoning.  If you are going to add uncooked Italian seasoning to a finished meat it needs to be done lightly.  Also my London broil was served with no ah jus or horseradish.  Would absolutely not recommend.",

The food is made from scratch, real mashed potatoes, homemade bread dressing for the sliced turkey, homemade tzatziki sauce, etc. The menu is extensive. The portions area very large. I had a turkey dinner and it was very good. My wife had a Greek omelet and she said that it was very good. Another person at our table had French toast and the bread was thick slices of challah. We did not have room for dessert but, like a New York/New Jersey diner, there is a rotating cooler by the cashiers station full of over-sized cakes. My wife and I will return.",

    "text": "I grew up about an hour east of Pittsburgh, so anytime I get to come home, getting a taste of home is always a treat for me.  Dayton, unfortunately, does not have many diners.  Naturally, I grew up hitting the various breakfast spots with my grandparents all across Western PA.  So, while out for my sister's wedding, Jules and I hit the Central Diner & Grille (CDG, from here on out), which shared a parking lot with our hotel.     When I first saw CDG, I expected a stereotypical greasy-spoon as from my youth.  Instead, we were treated to a clean, upscale experience with a drool-inducing bakery case out front, filled with all sorts of amazing confections.  While I was expecting a wait (especially on a weekend at the start of brunch/lunch rush), we were seated almost immediately.  The first thing that struck me about the food, though, were the portions.  The server eyed me a little skeptically when I ordered the French Toast with eggs, bacon and a side of hash browns, but I didn't think much of it.  Pretty standard breakfast, right?  Sweet zombie Jesus, I was wrong!  My hash browns came on a dinner platter of their own and must have comprised 2-3 whole potatoes on their own.  What's better?  The food was fantastic.  My French Toast came covered in delicious, fresh berries--most places, I'd expect some type of macerated fruit compote from a can, but these berries tasted of freshness and sweetness, with no unnecessary gel.  My hash browns were a perfect balance of soft and crispy, sauteed with diced onion and garlic.       Better yet?  The price!  Jules and I walked out of there--with tip--for less than $25.  We were stuffed for the duration of the long day, as we didn't eat again until the reception nearly 10 hours later.  Can't beat that with a stick!  If you're in the area, go here.  If you're not, make a road trip.  You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "One of the best diners I have ever been to. breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Late Night. Anytime we're near Robinson, my family always goes. The family that runs this place does a terrific job of running a tight ship while maintaining their sanity and kindness during the busiest hours. It's a well oiled machine in there and it's pretty entertaining to watch, I definitely recommend getting a front row seat at the counter!  As for the food, huge portions. You essentially get two meals for the price of one, and that's a great thing because the food is absolutely fantastic. Definitely get the house salad dressing with any salad you get, you won't regret it. I have been to Central 3 times now for dinner and twice for breakfast, and for dinner I get the Chicken Parm every time. Probably the best chicken parm I've had, and it is huge. The menu is extensive, you really can't go wrong with anything else. All of the Greek options, and pretty much everything else, is homemade and tastes fantastic. Desserts (cake and pies) are homemade as well. We've yet to have a bad, or even an average experience at Central. Each time has been excellent.  Recommend for anyone in the area... it's a can't miss. I hope Guy Fieri is watching.",

    "text": "If sandwiches with moldy bread and terrible service intrigues you, this is the restaurant for you! So I'll start from the beginning, we get there around 830pm and get seated promptly at a booth so we're happy, then our server comes around and takes our drinks, I asked for a raspberry tea and my date was cool with water. 15 minutes go by and our server is no where to be found then some random guy comes over and does the whole spiel again but I decided I was okay with the water our first server brought. So he takes our order and I ordered a Philly cheesesteak sub with fries and Cole slaw. After he took our order our server never came back until he brought the food out about 20 minutes later. So so far so good. A little misunderstanding with the first server but nothing big enough to ruin our dining experience. So I start eating my sub and I take a couple bites and then start eating the fries and I look down and I see mold on my break of my sub. I instantly stopped eating and told my date there's mold on my bread so we wait there for about 10 minutes for our server to come back but he never did so my date got up and went to find him at the computer where he was ringing another order in. He tells him about the mold and the server comes over and takes the sub and says \"oh sorry about that\" and then goes back to the kitchen. Then comes to tell me he's getting me another one (really not sure I want to eat here at this point) but a few minutes later the manager comes and brings me the new sub and says \"sometimes the kitchen gets so hot the bread goes bad, my apologies. I will send a desert back to you\" so yeah whatever pretty sure mold has to do with freshness and not heat. I've worked in plenty of restaurants to know this. So then the manager leaves I eat some of my sub then we wait another 15 minutes for our check and boxes: our server never came to check on us once I got the new sub. So we get our check and he asks us what dessert we want and we got it. But overall worst service I have ever had. I will never come back unless I'm craving moldy bread. For a place that just had a heath code violation a year ago you'd think they would pay attention to the freshness of the food they're serving.",

And the food totally scrumptious! I had the Napoleon Challah French toast - oh my goodness - 2 huge pieces of French toast topped with strawberries , bananas, pecans, and a little bit o' honey. I don't know how they did it but the French toast, not even slightly soggy even with all of the goodness on top. I also got a side of home fries which were yummy, just the slightest hint of onion. And sausage...and they weren't little links either. They were nice and big...yummy! The hubby chose the pancakes with eggs over easy and bacon. He loved it all. The pancakes were huge! They were so good you don't even need any syrup. And the bacon...a little crisp, delightful! I got a blueberry muffin to go and ate it later.  It was full of blueberries. The texture was just perfect, soft and full of blueberries (did I say that already:) full of blueberries!). And the service was fabulous! Our waitress was prompt. We also didn't need anything. She was on it, checking on us regularly and filling our glasses as needed. It was a terrific way to start the day and we would love to go and try dinner sometime.",

    "text": "I had heard good things from a co-worker, but didn't believe the hype.  This is as good as it gets for breakfast food in the Pittsburgh area.  We came in on a Saturday around 11 am.  The place was unbelieveably packed, but we had a table within 2 minutes.  They were quickly cleaning and seating like a well-oiled machine.  Our waiter arrived seconds later.  It's rather loud inside, but he was polite and quick to lean in to hear to make sure that he got our order correct.   We both started with water and then I ordered the big fat greek omelet with french fries, rye bread and no tomatoes.  J ordered the club sandwich also with fries.   Both items came out super fast and very hot.  My omelet was huge - filled with gyro meat (which was delicious and not greasy), onions, feta cheese with a glob of almost spicy tatziki sauce, brimming with cucumbers.  The toast was slathered with butter and toasted to a crisp perfection.  But what really blew my mind were the fries.  The fries were perfection.  Crispy, not greasy, potato-y - all in all,  they might be the BEST french fries ever.  These beat the fancy fries with truffle oil and parmesan.  They beat the double-fries Belgian frites (in fact, these might be double-fried).  All in all, the massive, and I mean, massive pile disappeared before my eyes.   J's club had hand-carved turkey that had been freshly roasted, fresh tomatoes and lettuce and delicious bread.    As we were sitting and munching through our meal, I saw the list go up for the dinner specials.  Leg of lamb?  Pastitsio?  Moussaka?  Stuffed pork chops?  I am honestly not kidding when I say that we were considering going back for dinner.   We will be returning soon!  (And they have a full bar and desserts that look to die for!)",

My boyfriend had the Jack burger with jalapeno pepper jack cheese and bacon aioli. What?! Yumm!! We also had an enormous slice of the birthday cake and chocolate and peanut butter cake. Uh-MAZING!!!  The biggest problem you'll have here is deciding what you wanna eat because you can get breakfast, salads, burgers, sandwiches, pasta, seafood, chicken, Greek food, and diner comfort food. Not to mention the giant case of deserts. If you haven't tried The Central Diner, you definitely should give it a try. The place is casual and the service was fantastic!

The caesar salad was ok, I received the salad with the dressing on the side which I thought was kind of weird for a caesar.   The crab cake meal was a much better experience. The french onion soup was very good. When I got the meal I got mashed potatoes as the side, which came with no gravy which was kind of odd as well. Maybe its just me thinking this is weird? haha  The atmosphere was awesome, and after reading a few more reviews I know next time to go with either breakfast or a greek dish! :)",

It was exactly what french toast should be, a bit crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside.  I think the only think that could have made this dish better was berries (fresh strawberries, blueberries and raspberries).  I got bacon with it and it's like they slaughtered a whole pig if you saw how much bacon it came with.

    "text": "My husband and I stopped in for breakfast after a hike around Raccoon Creek State Park. I chose the Central based on how close it was to the park and how favorable the reviews were. My server was sweet and attentive. Maybe the lunch and dinner are more exceptional, but the breakfast was not impressive. I asked for the pastrami omelette with home fries. What I got was scrambled eggs with a small amount of chopped up pastrami in it. (an omelette is eggs folded over the ingredients). No cheese in it, nothing to make it worth the $8.95 price tag. The home fries were obviously left over baked potatoes, peeled, hacked up and  briefly re-heated on a griddle. While I do not mind the idea of not wasting food by using up leftovers, the taste of a rewarmed baked potato is not what I was looking forward to after my walk. Hubby got the \"golden Brown Pancakes\" with Canadian bacon. He's not one to complain, especially when I was picking up the tab and the whole thing was my idea, but he said they were nothing special. The price was good, though. Any time I can pay 20 bucks on a sit-down meal it's fine with me.  On a side note: I hope the woman that passed out in the parking lot is OK.",

    "text": "We came in because of the reviews. Disappointed. My corned beef hash omelet was browned and dry. Wife's cream cheese and chives inlets was tasteless.  Home fries were barely warmed just like to cold plate of bacon. Must have been yesterday's. Coffee was bitter.  Our waitress was sweet and the place is pretty good looking. Bring a parka.",

    "text": "So good every time! Best place in Robinson for a wide variety of food.   They have huge portions for a great price. The food is amazing and that's anything on the menu. From breakfast to seafood to salads, anything you get will be great.  On top of their delicious food they are on top of their customer service. Always friendly and attentive to customers. Dinner time there is normally a bit of a line but it always moves fast and the wait is worth it.  Highly recommend the salads, lasagna, stuffed mushrooms, did I mention the lasagna? Breakfast is great, burgers and wraps. I have to say though if you like wedding soup, this is your place!! I absolutely love their wedding soup!",
