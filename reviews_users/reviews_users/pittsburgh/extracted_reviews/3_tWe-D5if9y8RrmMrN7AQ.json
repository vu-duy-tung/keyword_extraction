I wish I could remember our waiter's name, he was delightful. Made excellent recommendations & we had the following...  Gindara appetizer - EXCELLENT  The chicken teriakyi sampler. Sorry my brain is fried & I cant remember the name of the dish. Came w/shrimp & veggie tempura...  and a couple rolls of sushi & a few pieces of sashimi - EXCELLENT  4 sushi rolls... again, cant remember names sorry. The scallop roll, a roll w/eel & cucumber, rainbow roll & this odd sour plum & cucumber roll. Never seen it anywhere else so I had to try it. EXCELLeNT  Best f-ing meal of my life or at least right up there...   Waiter was super attentive. I admit i was a little worried because the place was almost empty on a Sat. night but it turned out to be exactly what we needed!!",

The tonkatsu was almost inedible as the meat inside was so chewy and stiff that the breaded outside kept falling off. The miso soup was bland and the sushi was really mediocre, especially for the price. They had a good crab/potato fried side that was pretty good that came with the meal but that's literally all. Not to mention the prices are outrageous and the meal doesn't even come with salad! I don't know if we went on a bad day but there was hardly anyone there and I'm not sure it was even worth half the price we paid. I guess I can't expect that high of quality Japanese food in Pittsburgh but this was disgraceful.",

Miso soup with tofu was good. The hot sake wasn't really that great, but my overall experience was good enough to ignore it. We had a dessert, chocolate mousse cake with vanilla, which was awesome!  Loved the ambiance, and service was really good and timely. The staff was very polite. Your best bet for parking is the parking lot nearby. Kiku will give you a parking validation for $2 off. We ended paying just $2 after this validation.",

    "text": "Different people have different tastes. I'm positive that this is at least a 3 star establishment in general, and that for what it is, it very well may deserve 4 stars. If you really like sushi, you probably should go here. If you do not specifically enjoy sushi, this is not for you. My personal level of satisfaction with our visit weighed in at about 2 stars. My friends gave it a 3, but I'm not sure they were thinking clearly. To preface, I despise sushi. Going there was not my idea. I'd have rather eaten a balogna sandwich. I hate balogna. The other two people with me are sushi fans. Obviously, I did not order sushi. I was confident there would be some non-sushi dish on the menu that I would be more than glad to try. Wrong. I ordered Kaarage, which I was assured was fried chicken. It was made from that extra low quality ridiculously cheap chicken you can find in stores that's been compressed into the shape of a chicken breast then soaked forever in broth. The end result was very fatty deep fried chicken that tasted to me like barbecued salt. My friends, a pair of unabashed barbecued salt lovers, enjoyed the chicken. I couldn't finish it once realizing what low quality product it was made from. Please, people of Kiku, read this and stop using that chicken. One of my friends ordered the teriyaki steak and said it was alright, but nothing special. That sounded like it described what I saw. He also ordered some form of sushi, which he found to be competent. The other fellow ordered raw scallop sushi and did not enjoy it, but I don't fault the restaurant for that one bit. If you don't know for a fact that you enjoy raw scallops, you have no business ordering it and then complaining about it. For all I know, this place has the best raw scallop sushi on Earth. The sushi did look great. I have no problems believing that it is expertly prepared. Dessert looked interesting, but we skipped it on account of the presence of ice cream in everything given the fact that most of us are lactose intolerant and we were all sharing one hotel room. Moving on, the service was good - but at some point our water was refilled and acquired a bizarre seltzer-like flavor that we could not identify the source of. It wasn't enjoyable. I'd love to know how that happened. Life is so full of mystery, and Kiku is no exception.",

    "text": "This remains the only authentic Japanese sushi restaurant in the Pittsburgh area. It has been here since 1982, and the chef is 40-year certified preparer - the real deal. I spend a good deal of time in larger cities - like NYC, where you can find good sushi on every other corner and I can say - as an advanced sushi connoisseur (I've been eating raw fish since I was 2) this place is the right place for the advanced palette. There will be things in the back that are not present on the menu so as not to scare away the average customer - but they will have everything that they can obtain safely - simply ask.   Sure, it's going to be expensive. You have to pay much more for quality in a land-locked city, and Pittsburgh, though what I like to call \"cutely diverse\" does not have the array of resources for quality sushi without a price. Ask the chef here and he will tell you that most of the seafood he has comes in from a very reputable atlantic source - think New York.  I would recommend any handroll, and the specialty roll. Order Amaebi (raw sweet shrimp) when in season and you will be a happy camper. The oshitoshi is well seasoned with salmon skin and a delicious soy mixture - not too salty. And the green tea ice cream goes well with a spoonful of red beans.  ENJOY!",

    "text": "Kiku ... maybe it's my fault that I used to love you, and now we're just friends. It could be that I ordered a measley eel/cucumber roll, and maybe you didn't find that fancy enough. Or a Philadelphia (that you so endearingly renamed Shadyside). In my Dynamite, you forgot my spicy mayo (maybe that's for the better, but you did kindly garnish the plate with a bit).   All three of my rolls, it seems you forgot some of the fish. It hurts my heart; your fish is so fresh ... when you put it in the roll, I enjoy it even more. I should've stuck to the Sushi Regular or the Chirashi, because those have been perfect in visits past.   Your ginger dressing is still to-die-for, even though at $4 I feel a little portion robbed on the salad. And I'm wondering about the newest edamame fad - salt your own. Is this fad in fact, or faux paux?   Kiku is still my second-favorite sushi restaurant in Pittsburgh. But with the recent menu renovations, I'm wondering if they're trying to be a little 'more' than they should - it's quality sushi, in a good environment ... but the prices need to return to being justified.",

Have you seen some of the prices here?  And anyways, I always thought chopsticks were made out of bamboo, which is renewable.    That little rant aside, I was here last night for the first time in quite awhile.  A lot of the food here seems to be some version of teriyaki or tempura.  I'm not all that familiar with Japanese food, so I don't know if this is the norm.  Pittsburgh doesn't have very many Japanese restaurants to choose from.  But feeling a little adventurous, I tried the Unaju, which is grilled eel on a bed of rice with Kiku's own eel sauce.  Y'know, I'm glad I tried it 'cos it was really good.  All of their entrees come with their amazing miso soup.  So why only a three-star rating?  It just seems that Kiku is a little pricey for what you get.  As another poster says, it's one of the few non-gigachain restaurants remaining in Station Square.  But even the lunch menu ain't all that cheaper.",

The decor is a simple Japanese style. The music took away from the food and decor. It was a strange hybrid between modern sounding guitar and traditional Japanese music, either way it became slightly annoying after the first few minutes. We ordered miso and and 6 rolls. The soup was alright. The rolls were presented nicely, but over sauced and tasted salty. The quality of the food did not warrant the cost. Single pieces of sushi were outrageously priced. No where near the quality of CA sushi, but it was okay for Pittsburgh. I was highly surprised by the rave reviews listed across social media sites.  Overall, would not recommend.",

I have to say, I expected more (of a station square restaurant) but it was really really good sushi.  I can't complain one single bit about anything except that I had probably built it up too much in my head.  I think it was the lack of ambiance that let me down.  The biggest thing that sticks in my mind is that the tables could have easily been at McDonald's - they were cookie cutter boring tables with no effort to dress them up or make them match the Asian decor at all.  I'm probably being too picky....   We got gyoza to start, which was wonderful.  Then, spicy tuna rolls, Shadyside rolls (salmon/cream cheese), and Steeler's rolls (eel/avocado).  My favorite was the Steeler's roll, but they were all quite good.  A bit expensive for what we got...but...with the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate, which I got 80% off at the time, we had dinner for 2 for about $25 including tip.

    "text": "Had the best Toro ever at a Pittsburgh sushi joint the other night with the girl.  Whenever I go to a new sushi restaurant, wherever I am, I ask if they have Toro. A restaurant that has Toro in the first place, is a good sign. Then, a restaurant that has good Toro is obscure. A restaurant with amazing Toro, is a restaurant you frequent.  2 pieces of toro nigiri is be pure heaven if it iswhat they say it is.  I have been to several restaurants that gave me \"Toro\" and it obviously wasn't... or it was a pitiful example of such. Toro is the belly/neck of the fish. It's the part of the fish that gets very little excercise (relatively) compared to the rest of the fish. So this meat is rich in buttery fat that you can see wet on the meat like little beads of oil. And unlike normal blue fin tuna which is reddish in color. The fat in toro gives it a lighter, closer to pink/white color.  Well needless to say Kiku was serving up some crazy good toro when we went... at like 8, on a Sunday night.   The rest of the meal was great. I felt bad coming in at 8 on a Sunday but we sat in the bar, there were other people there chatting with the bartender, and the waitress made us feel very welcome.  This seemed to be a no frills sushi joint, which is just fine with me.  We are about the fish.  Their maki rolls seemed to be limited but we had a roll and the sashimi platter which was very impressive.  The platter had egg, octopus, mackerel, tuna, salmon, yellow tail, and one other I think. Pretty impressive selection for like 25 dollars.  The cut of the sushi, the size of the cut, the temperature of the fish are all extremely important factors in perfect sushi and Kiku sushi did a mighty fine job in all regards. We will go back and see if we were just lucky or if this was a standard meal.  Kiku might have just gave Little Tokyo Mt Lebanon a little friendly competition.  7.5 of 10 stars to be specific",

    "text": "To me, this is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh. Not the best Japanese or Asian place, but the hands-down best.   The sushi is sublime. From your basic tuna rolls to your fancier hand rolls and specialties, I've not had anything I didn't want more of. The second-best sushi I've ever had.   However, what makes this place shine is how good everything ELSE tastes! Too often, people thing Japanese = sushi. From the simple miso soup and house salad (which were far above others I've had) to the various platters, each dish tastes like a delicacy. The steak and chicken teriyaki are delicious choices that satisfy the more timid palate, and the various hot dishes that arrive on platters are all also excellent. Even the desserts, though simple, are excellent. I recommend the anjou pear poached in plum wine.   The downsides of this place are parking ($), price ($$$), and interior. Being in Station Square, you'll likely have to pay to park. The portions are not large for the money, which means you'll spend even more to be full. I expect to spend upwards of $70 for two when I come here. Also, the inside is plain and somewhat dated, which doesn't attract me.   However, the incredible preparation and taste of the food here have kept me coming back any time I can afford a fancy meal!",

    "text": "I was excited to try Kiku due to the Yelp reviews when we stopped in Pittsburgh for a night en route to New York. Being a half Japanese woman living in Kentucky, I jump at the opportunity to get traditional Japanese at any chance I can get since my hometown is littered with sushi bars that specialize more in mayonnaise, fried, or spicy sauce laden fusion sushi rather than real Japanese food.  Kiku was definitely run by Japanese folk and the menu had the usual traditional fare. The food was pretty okay. We had the Agedashi Dofu which the broth was so mild it's taste didn't transfer well to the tofu. They garnished with green onion and daikon oroshi (grated radish) but didn't have the customary bonito flakes. They also charged a whopping $6 for probably a 2-1/2 ounce portion. I'd pay overblown prices for a good Agedashi Tofu, but this wasn't one. The Agedashi experience kind of defines the rest of our meal. Everything tasted okay but the prices were beyond ridiculous. We then realized we were in a touristy part of town and missed out on a lot of the amazing farm to folk fare in other areas. This place is meant to pull in hotel guests who aren't really looking for real culinary fare and are unaware they are getting raped by prices.  The tuna in our tuna roll was on it's way out, the smelt we ordered were just grilled with no sprinkle of sea salt or any kind of sauce--and again, a whopping $8 for three small fish. All sushi was ordered by the piece and about 20% more expensive they any other sushi bar I've been to outside of the Pacific Northwest, Tokyo, and NYC.  (Example: $6 for two pieces of salmon). The advertised \"mixed green salad\" was cut with iceberg lettuce. The chawanmushi was bland and a small tea cup size. If you are charging $8 for chawanmushi, use real crab. At least snow crab. And throw in a ginko nut.  On the good side, the dressing was yummy, the salmon sushi was really fresh, and the service was decent.   Overall, food is not awful but not exciting and the prices are beyond ridiculous for what you get.",

The service was fine, the price was a little high but the sushi was amazing. I had the Toro, Big eye and Hamachi. My wife had the seared tuna salad ( also rated a 5) if you enjoy quality sushi you should give it a try.",

If you are looking for crazy rolls and sushi mixed with this and that go somewhere else.  If you are looking for authentic top quality sashimi or sushi go here.  I had bonito, king mackerel, toro, red snapper... All were served with just the slightest embellishment, the fish speaks for itself.  Even the soy sauce is homemade! Some of the best sushi I have ever had at very reasonable prices.",

The place is a little tricky to find if you're not familiar with the area. Restaurant seemed nice and everyone was very friendly. Although the sushi wasn't horrible, it wasn't that great either. I'm not sure if we caught them on a bad night considering it was Sunday. They seemed sloppy and rushed. Not a lot of care was given into the rolls as they were falling apart. Ingredients within the rolls didn't taste fresh either nor were they consistent within the same roll.  Overall, I would try it again at some point but after I've tried other places first.",

Not to stereotype, but when i see asians dining in an Asian restaurant, it tends to put me more at ease about the food.   Instead of looking through the menu, I went the lazy route and got the Lovers plate for two. The place was fairly packed for a Sunday evening, so the sushi chef was a bit backed up. Our waiter was one of the best ive ever had. If I remember his name, i'll be sure to update and post here to give him kudos. I use to work restaurant so i was patient for our food, I peeked around to check out other people order, and i saw the dessert that was brought out to our neighboring table and I told myself that I must have it too! the sushi was fair and the both of us were stuffed.  Still, I MUST have the dessert, so we got the fried ice cream.  It was on a plate with red bean sauce, 2 oranges, and 2 c antelope slices. YuMM! Theres still much more that I want, so i will def come back to try the other desserts. and hopefully, request the same waiter!",

It's rare that yelp ever leads me wrong, but this is not a 4 or even 3 star sushi experience. Service was very nice from Wait staff. Food was downright poor. I had their Sashimi dinner and the portions we small, the assortment poor and the quality mediocre. Really a sad Tamago (egg custard) on a Sashimi plate? I even had to ask where the listed salmon was for it to be added back on the plate.   If not for the pleasant wait staff, this would be a 1 for my first time on yelp. Skip it and find another.",

It made for a nice environment, what with the inside being somewhat dark but spacious and traditional Japanese music playing in the background. We ordered a couple donburis from the lunch menu. While the pretty lunch boxes that they came in seemed small at the onset, they turned out to be pretty filling. The tempura one came with three shrimp pieces plus a few vegetable pieces, all of which were fluffy and slightly crispy on the outside and flavorful inside. The katsu was better--just as tasty with the breading on the outside of the meat, and accompanied by sliced onions and carrots. The side miso soup and pickled vegetables were super authentic as well.",

From sushi to sukiyaki to chawanmushi (even takowasa, if you're feeling adventurous).  They offer dishes for less experienced eaters, as well as catering to people looking to try something new. I have never had a bad meal here.  I will say it can get pricey, but never unjustifiably so.

If you get the maki rolls, the quality and flavor of the fish can get lost. Also, you won't get to have the fatty tuna in a roll. You'll be missing out!

We tried the kushi katsu, dynamite roll (spicy scallops) definitely spicy but love it, sashimi platter seems like a small portion for two but still worth it if you like sashimi bc of variety and taste.  The sashimi is fresh and definitely the best I've tasted in awhile.    My hubby was still hungry after these, so we ordered the beef maki and curry calamari. The calamari was huge and we liked that the breading was soft but not soggy. It's hard to explain the texture. All sauces were on point as well.  My mouth is watering just thinking about the food.  I also tried the fujiyama cocktail which is vodka, pina colada and banana.  The glass was small, so I probably could've had 2 or 3 since it tasted good. Haha.  The price wasn't as bad as other sushi/japanese places.  Server was friendly, prompt and attentive. She even offered to validate our parking, which took $2 off.  We didn't know they validated.  I liked the ambience/decor.  I think they're going for an old school authentic japanese look.  My hubby said it was plain for his taste.  Overall, I recommend this place!",

Even though nice and clean atmosphere, the service was very very slow. The place was not busy at all and it took forever to receive any drinks or food. Then when bill finally came, we provided our cards, waited 40 minutes to get them back with no water in our glasses. Our glasses were empty and I had to finally get up and ask if we were getting our cards back. At that time is when they were doing the payment at the cashier. So if you have time to blow on waiting and waiting then this place is for you. However if you want to have a nice dinner and be out in less than 1.5 hours do not go here. Yes we had 10 people in our group but waiting 1 hour for food and 40 minutes for check then don't go here. Thank you.",

You must understand, I love sushi and it's not because I love drinking a whole bunch of sake before I eat the sushi, during, and after.  I go for the sashimi bc I'm not effing around w the rice.  If I'm dining w friends who say they like sushi but won't stray beyond a tuna roll, then I'll just eat regular nigiri w the rice but...bring me raw fish, on a wooden boat, and I'm a happy girl brandishing chopsticks.  I am SO very tired of people talking about Umi.  Umi is spectacular and I love it, but there is other sushi to be had.  I've DONE Chaya and Sushi Too and Sushi Kim and Ginza (RIP) and Kotobuki and Ooshi Bento...  But I always forget about Kiku, and I think it's because its tucked away in station square.  Newly rediscovered, I recommend you dine here.  Its beautiful inside.  They have one of the most sushi restaurant expansive menus in Pittsburgh.  Will sushi make your friend gag?  Bring them here anyway, there is so much to choose from, sushi or otherwise.  The pricing is reasonable.  The place does not smell like fish.  You'll leave full, and happy, and you wont feel like your wallet has just been raped.  There is a reason that Kiku has been around for so long, and that it has been nothing but consistent.  Good service, great food, & good atmosphere.  If you haven't been to Kiku in awhile, pay them a visit.  Now I'm craving sushi and I just had some....",

The kitchen had a spicy relish Sriracha spiced salsa which provided a much needed texture difference.  I had this coupled with a 2 bottles of warm sake.   LIfe was good.  If you are in the Station Square Area (my first time) and crave sushi.   I would recommend this place.  Atmosphere - not many people in the restaurant - very quiet. Service - Awesome.   Our server made sure we received our food and libations. Price - $12-15 per roll, $4-6 for individual pieces (large in size)",

Anyway, I went here for a large group gathering ( greater than 12 of us in total).  They were able to accommodate us at a very long table.  For the most part we were left to our own devices with the server really only showing up for orders, to drop of drinks once, food delivery and check delivery.  Thankfully, that's pretty much exactly what we needed and we were all able to catch up with each other mostly uninterrupted.   It is a unique little environment that I can only describe as cute.  In terms of the food, I ordered a salmon roll and the salmon was deliciously moist with deliciously excellent rice.  I definitely had one of those moments, where I realized how bad some other sushi rice was by taking one bite of my meal at Kiku.  Overall, there are the general gluten free options afforded by most sushi/ Japanese restaurants and no contamination issues.  Call ahead and they can definitely accommodate a fairly significant party.",

    "text": "If you like Japanese food, go to Kiku.  If you are thinking about the possibility of putting raw fish in your face for the first time, for the love of god, go some place where you'll have a good experience, which in Pittsburgh means Kiku.   Some might claim it's too expensive. NOT SO. The prices are low considering the  exquisite quality and portion size of the food, the meal add-ons (everyone gets their miso soup!) and the fantastic ambiance.   This is the one place I've been repeatedly (probably upwards of 20 times, no joke) that has never ONCE disappointed in any way.   What Kiku says on its website:  \"KIKU emerged from Sushi Gen, a popular Tokyo sushi bar. KIKU's owners migrated to Pittsburgh in 1983, and were one of the first restaurants to serve sushi in Pittsburgh. KIKU, which was designed to resemble a tea house, has been serving authentic, top quality Japanese cuisine since.\"  is TOTALLY TRUE. Having been to Japan several times, and being therefore something of a Japanese food snob, (why can NO ONE IN AMERICA GET THE RICE RIGHT!??) I found a bastion of authentic, amazing Japanese food right in my own back yard!   Does Kiku's menu feature some of the American \"sushi staples?\" Of course it does. They have to make money in the Pittsburgh market, after all.   Does the fact that they have a Philadelphia Roll make the delicate, savory tempura any less appealing? Does that make the fresh perfection of the fish any less tantalizing? Does that make their frankly intoxicatingly amazing udon any less...intoxicatingly amazing? Not. One. Bit.   Venture off the beaten path here and I swear, you will be one happy fish-stuffed camper.   All this, and THEN they go and create a little bit of Tokyo in Pittsburgh (actually a lot of Tokyo. The place is HUGE compared to it's Tokyo counterparts.) But they really did accomplish capturing the soothing, serene ambiance of a genuine Japanese tea house, especially at lunch or slightly off-hours when fewer patrons stuff their maws with amazing Nigiri Sushi, Temaki, Tonkatsu and more. The service is excellent, with warm scented towels presented pre-meal with which you wipe your hands, to ever-present but not obtrusive waiters who will cater to your every need, sometimes even before that need is voiced.   Did I mention they make their own soy sauce? I'd bathe in that stuff. It tastes good enough that I'm sure it's good for the skin. Amazing. Go to Kiku. And then message me and thank me for sending you there. After you wake up from your food coma of course.",

If only comparing the dish names on menu to other Japanese places in town, not a big difference can be seen. But the freshness they keep in their food is just amazing. From sushi, sashimi to the fried tempura and the grilled shioyaki, they are all so fresh! That I believe, is the soul of Japanese food.  Went with friends for the first time tonight. We had mixed tempura, shioyaki, chirashi sushi and the sushi lover for two. Everything was absolutely great except for the cucumber-tuna rolls, which mainly served as refreshment between great flavors (I used them the way as Japanese people use ginger). Entrees came with miso soup, which also tasted good.   Price is okay regarding the type and quality of food, ~35 per person for us to get pretty full. Taken the fact its a Japanese restaurant, and such a good one, I really can't complain about anything.",

My friends all wanted chain places but I won out convincing them we could try those anywhere.    As other reviewers have mentioned, it seemed very empty.  Each time I've been here it was a Friday night and there were maybe two other tables with diners.   That being said, when we were greeted, they allowed us to choose which section of the restaurant we wanted to sit in.    The decor is what you would expect from a Japanese restaurant.  A lot of wood and prints.  It has a sort of cozy feel.    There is a decent sized menu along with a variety of daily specials.  I do have to question the specials, though, as they were the same in each of my visits.  There is something that will please every palate, including someone who won't try sushi or anything \"exotic\"  For example, they even have fried chicken as an appetizer.  On one of our visits, my husband was feeling adventurous and tried the Shabu Shabu.  Basically Japanese fondue.  It came with noodles, meat and a variety of vegetables.  It was tasty, but very pricey for what you got.  Other diners were pleased with their choices of various tempura dishes and a \"super combo.\"  Rolls were typical of what you would find at any other Japanese restaurant.  They were tasty, but nothing too imaginative.  Overall, a good experience and decent food, but it is more pricey then most other Japanese restaurants in the Pittsburgh area.",

They added to their dessert menu but I rarely get that far since I usually get stuffed on their amazing food. Their sushi is just as good as sushi at Japanese restaurants in coast cities. They aren't fancy with their rolls with over 10 ingredients, like other places. They're pretty simple, but that's what makes their sushi so good. You can taste the freshness of the fish.

The contrast of the temperatures was  just not right, but the fish was fresh. The sea urchin was just okay, which I probably should have expected.

Please try their sukiyaki and shabu shabu (a Japanese style hot pot) in which you put beef, veggies and udon noodles. They offer a raw egg as the sauce, even being from China I found that very new, surprising and I did accept eating it with a raw egg!!! In addition to the raw egg they also offer another two types of sauces and a pot of soup base in case we ran out of soup or warm water in the pot. Sukiyaki is slightly salty with a rich soup base, and it has bamboo shoots, rice noodle, onions in it. Both \"hot pots\" are perfect! Also tried their tempuras some other times, loved how they fried veggies, shrimp and chicken. The first time I went there I also tried the matcha cheesecake it is really special too! This restaurant is really authentic. I do hope they add pictures on their menu though as a lot of the times we do not know what the menu says...

Opening hours: Kiku is open 7 days a week, lunch and dinner.  Chaya has no lunch and not open on Sunday. Parking: KiKu is in Station Square, so there is a parking lot.  Having said that, parking that you pay for (extra $10 I think...)  Food-wise: KiKu has better Toro. And often their Toro are included in the dinner set. So if you are a Toro fan, KiKu is for you. They have Chef's selection set as well, but they do not have set that includes scallops and uni (for certain).  I saw they have uni on the menu, but only ordered per piece. (uni sushi / $6, uni and egg / $6.5) I will just say Chaya has set that includes scallops and uni.  So if Toro is more important than variety, Kiku for sure. If you prefer variety more than just toro, you might need to try both.",

It may seem a little pricier compared to other Japanese places in Pittsburgh, but you quickly realize you're getting your money's worth and that it's a more than fair price for the quality you get. The value you get for what you pay exceeds what I've seen in NYC and the Bay Area. The quality of fish, the level of consistency, and the skill of the chefs is on par with and exceeds that of some establishments in those cities. This restaurant can easily hold its own against those (at the same price point) in London, NYC, SF, and DC (Japan does have better fish by far, but it's also a long flight away -- and it's Japan.) I liked their ika uniae (squid and sea urchin) appetizer, and their hotate nigiri was a unique and refreshing interpretation. I recall that they had sea urchin from Maine, which is rare these days. King salmon nigiri was good too. I sat at the sushi bar both times I've been there. My first time, I ordered the sushi lover for 2, which we felt was good value. My second time here, I ordered nigiri a la carte: I enjoyed the chef's recommendations. The tuna was good, and I especially enjoyed their chutoro. If there was one thing that could be improved, I felt that the nori (seaweed) could have been briefly toasted in the toaster oven to get it a little crisp. The reviewer who commented on the relative temperatures of the shari (rice) and neta (topping) had a point as well. Parking is convenient but unfortunately expensive. This is definitely good authentic Japanese food - I'd recommend it in a heartbeat. I enjoyed their mochi ice cream dessert as well.",

We got the shabu shabu and sukiyaki in one meal, along with a tempura dish, and we were stuffed! Every dish had a wonderful presentation! If you're craving some really good Japanese food, come here! It is a little pricey and in a slow area, but trust me, it's worth it!",

When we first entered, the decor is VERY old, looks like it hasn't changed since 1980. We went on a Sunday night and there were about five tables total in the restaurant. The server was pleasant and efficient, we didn't wait for anything. We tried about fifteen different types of sushi and all were phenomenal. The sushi was the freshest I've ever had. We kept ordering pieces of the toro because it was so buttery and amazing. Even the ginger salad I ordered was good, not just iceberg lettuce. The other Japanese restaurant staple, miso soup, wasn't watery and had tons of flavor. Station Square may be a ghost town but Kiku is a hidden gem. Will definitely be back.",

There are four pieces perfectly fried chicken thigh in one order of Karaage. As a decent Japanese restaurant  should present, the flavorful juice exploded with each bite of the Karaage! The grilled mackerel is good, too, yet a little salty to my like.  For entree we had the sukiyaki. And it was amazing!! The soup is so much more than normal sukiyaki sauce or ponzu sauce. As the soup starts boiling and the vegetables start melting, the unique taste of shiitake mushrooms, the sweetness of carrots and the spiciness of onions and green onions mix together to generate a rich flavor. In this delicious soup base you cook the thin beef slices and dip them in the egg sauce for a very tender texture. They just melt in your mouth! I'll definitely come again for the sukiyaki!  For drinks, I had a Kiku punch which is quite light and sweet. My friend had the green tea, which is also pretty good.",

Quaint, welcoming and minimalist in decor--also in a good way. Service was excellent as was the food. My colleague had seared tuna with a green salad, and I had three maki rolls. Wonderful!",

    "text": "Wow wow wow! This place is amazing and just might be the best sushi place in Pittsburgh. I was told about this place by a friend and was not expecting much since it's in station square. Most of the restaurants at Station Square are a little too touristy or \"chainy\" for me.   I would have never thought an authentic and high quality experience would be tucked away in station square. It was a little difficult finding the restaurant, since I had to enter a building with other shops and offices. The security guard behind the counter luckily showed me that the restaurant was just around the corner.   I had to walk through some curtains to enter the restaurant. I was in awe when I saw the traditional Japanese decor and the sushi bar, where you could sit and enjoy watching the chef prepare the sushi. My friend and I ordered the sushi lover's meal which contains about 25 different pieces of sushi.   Our meal started with some hot towels to wash our hands- a nice little detail. The meal included miso soup, which might've been the best miso soup I've ever had.   I was really impressed that the server asked if I would prefer wasabi on the side or inside the sushi. We went with on the side, since my friend does not like spicy. However, next time I would definitely try sushi with wasabi inside (I think that's the traditional way of eating sushi). The sushi was phenomenal and I was really impressed with the quality of the fish. Everything was really fresh and the salmon was wonderful, it felt like it was melting on my mouth.   The prices are very fairly priced. I would say that it was affordable for the amount and service we received. The sushi took some time to be prepared however, I did not mind because I knew that sushi takes some focus and detail to execute well and boy, did Kiku deliver.",

It was very basic, shrimp tempura roll, salmon avocado, California roll, and spicy tuna roll are the rolls we ordered. They were smaller with 6 pieces each. The pricing was comparable for those rolls at other places. The best thing I ordered was the miso soup with crab meat. We didn't have any issues of any kind, I just feel like the sushi was basic and small for my taste. I would not return here again.",

Started with a large bottle of Kirin Ichiban. Seemed like a bargain for $7. From there, I got the deluxe platter, which consisted of miso soup, a few rolls and several pieces of basic sushi...tuna, salmon, shrimp, a whitefish (yellowtail?), and a few others. Knowing I was hungry, I also ordered the Steelers roll (in Pittsburgh after all). A roll topped with eel and avocado. Everything was authentic and delicious. I wish Kiku was closer to where I lived because I'd eat here often.",

    "text": "My parents and I went to Kiku in hopes of having good sushi. It was a Wednesday dinner, and there were probably 4 parties (total of 13 people) in the restaurant. We ordered a sushi deluxe, two rolls, a sashimi platter, and a sake. We were seated... for the next 1 hour and 20 minutes!  We finished our drink and complimentary miso soup, and no one bothered to check on us.   The food was probably above average in Pittsburgh, but it certainly didn't worth 80 minutes of waiting. I don't know if they are under staffed because of the renovation, but the waiting time was ridiculous. I asked our waitress if this was typical (I hope not), but she lukewarmly said the chef was busy. Okay... I guess the unpleasant dining experience won't make me want to visit Kiku for the second time.",

Considering they're on the pricier side, I was expecting a higher quality experience than I actually received. We started off with the Tofu Steak which sounds fantastic on print but the dish itself was unimpressive. Essentially, it was a couple slabs of raw tofu drenched in a soy sauce - not horrible but definitely would not recommend. Then it came time for the main event - the sushi. I ordered the 16-piece vegetable sushi dinner which had a kampyo roll, a vegetable roll, and 1 piece of the carrot, mushroom, and avocado. I had to force it down simply because I didn't want my $18 to go to waste! It was equivalent to the quality of sushi found in grocery stores - but at least they have the decency to charge you $7 for it. Nothing tasted fresh and the vegetables were even browning. Pass!   The one redeeming factor had to be their dessert. I am a matcha fanatic so of course I had to get not only one but TWO matcha desserts. I got the Matcha Cheesecake and Matcha Ice Cream - both were AMAZING! Although I'm not normally a cheesecake fan, this is definitely an exception. Highly recommend!  The service was very spotty. Although our server was friendly, he was not as efficient or available as we would have preferred. There were very long stretches of time where we had to wait on him to return after asking him to complete a small task even though the restaurant was not very busy at the time. Not the most impressive display of customer service, but he did his job.",

When I found Kiku, I was so excited to go and try their food!   It's  located in Commerce Court which is right facing the indoor parking building. We got there around 6 and there were not many people. We decided to order steak tofu, veggie and shrimp tempura, sashimi platter, udon, and chirashi sushi rice bowl which is basically sashimi with rice underneath. Me and my roommate were so AMAZED about how fresh and delicious their sashimi was. Everything we ordered was so oishi!! We ended our night with match cheesecake and pudding. The pudding was just so refreshing because it's not too sweet and it had strong eggy taste which we love.   People at Kiku were super friendly and helpful! I definitely would love to go back again!",

The rice is also beautifully balanced between sweet and vinegar flavors. The sushi chefs are observant -- they watch how you eat and how you respond and tailor the sushi to your habits. For example, if you dip the fish side into the soy sauce instead of dunking the rice, they will form the rice loosely so that it dissolves in your mouth. Ahhh!  Ask the sushi chef what is good that day and follow his advice! Service otherwise is friendly and unobtrusive.",

    "text": "I went here last weekend for a late lunch/early dinner type thing.  It was about 430 PM on Saturday and I was visiting my friend Rob's and he has told me for a long time his favorite spot for sushi is Kiku.  I had been in the past, but not since I really developed a palate for sushi.  Anyways, I really didn't want to like this place initially because of its tourist trap location of Station Square across the way from hard rock cafe, hooters and the like.  I was wrong to judge so quickly.  This restaurant basically brought sushi to pittsburgh 25 years ago and I guess they shouldn't be judged for a housing decision made long ago when places like hooters didn't even exist (a glorious time indeed).  You step into this restaurant and its like stepping into a different atmosphere completely.  You are away from the obnoxious interrogation mall lights into a dimly lit soothing atmosphere.  I think the only sound you here is water running from somewhere and the restaurant is intimate while still being private.  There is a small bar and dining room to the immediate left and further in the back there is a sushi bar manned by gents' who look like actual sushi chefs and I was told by one of the staff have over 75 years experience combined between the three.  We sit in the front dining/bar area.  The place is pretty empty due to the early hour, but this is good because it gives us pretty much free reign for Rob and Olga's boy Alex.  The server comes over promptly. She's a young japanese girl with a big and corteous smile.  She offers warm rags and asks if she can bring anything for the boy while we decide.  We start with the sushi lovers platter for two and share it between the three of us.  It's not cheap at about $48.  However, the sushi is quite good.  The rice cooked perfectly with just the right amount of wasabi.  The fish very fresh and sliced well.  They even offer toro on this sampler.  All in all very good sushi, but certainly not the best in Pittsburgh.  I'd say right now the best sushi in Pittsburgh is Umi (you'll pay for it though).  Next the waitress brings some miso soup which is good, but unmemorable.  I was a bit surprised to see they had only one or two choices for sake and almost no wine list to speak of.  We tried some good cold sake.  It was fine, but quite expensive.  I think around $30/bottle for three small pours total.  Rob and I had one each.  Next we tried the \"shobu shobu\".  This is a fondue type way of eating in which they bring over a steaming pot of savory broth along with a side of sliced steak, noodles, tofu, veggies etc. and diners get to cook their own food.  It's a fun way to eat when you are with some other folks on a personal night out.  It'd be good for date night or friends, but I think a little off if it were for a business meeting.  The food itself is fine.  I mean the meat is okay quality the veggies seem fresh and its fun to cook yourself, but probably not a gourmet dining experience.  The cost is $21 per person (minimum of 2 people) fo this dish.  This place deserves kudos for bringing sushi to pittsburgh. It has good sushi and seemingly other good traditional japanese dishes.  My biggest pet peeve with this place is that the cost seems out of line with the location and food.  I didn't pay, but I bet Rob didn't get out of there for less than $200 and we really didn't even drink.  If you find yourself in Station Square you could do a lot worse than this place and you should go here since its a local business and not the mega mcfunsters that seem to invaded this once fun spot.",

The restaurant itself is located in the middle of a dumpy mall -- there are numerous no-name stores selling Steeler's memorabilia or cheap clothing and then you see Kiki Japanese Restaurant.  Inside the place was dim, but with minimalist Japanese decor.      I took a seat at the bar, ordered an asahi and spent some time going through the menu -- it's nice to see an actual Japanese restaurant as opposed to the standard \"Asian favorites\" found at some places.  Wasn't really feeling the sushi, after all this place was in the corner of a dumpy mall, so I played it safe and went with a teriyaki dish and some noodles.  Fantastic!  Who knew noodles could taste so good!    I finished every last bit of food (yes, quite a feat for me), and went back the hotel where I looked them up on-line to find they were named the best sushi in Pittsburgh in 2007.  Others labeled them \"the only real Japanese restaurant in the area.\"  Moral of the story: don't be alarmed by restaurants located in seedy shopping centers.",

    "text": "I decided to give Kiku a whirl since it was probably the least touristy of dining establishments in Station Square (which proudly features Joe's Crab Shack and Hard Rock Cafe).  It was edible but certainly there must be better Japanese food somewhere in Pittsburgh.  I started with a small size Udon which was decent - had one shrimp tempura, fish cake, mushrooms, the standard stuff.  Next up was the salmon and avocado roll - not only was there more avocado then salmon but the rice around the roll must have been a 1/4 inch thick!  Talk about stingy with the fish.  I also had a spicy tuna hand roll which was pretty good but not spicy enough.  I looked around at the nigiri at other tables and there was a big base of rice and the fish definitely didn't extend past the edges.    The restaurant is also in need of a renovation.  The seating areas were very dim but the sushi bar had lots of fluorescent lighting going on and it was a very harsh, uncomfortable, unflattering contrast.",

Yes, the lighting is dim and it's not exactly chic, but the food is excellent. Kiku was where I had my very first sushi, and it's hard for any sushi to live up to it.   The tuna and salmon rolls are always very fresh with the perfect amount of wasabi and their entrees are great, especially for those who don't like sushi or even Japanese food. And one of my all-time favorite foods is their tempura ice cream, with its sweet buttery tempura crust and fresh vanilla bean ice cream. Mmm. Delicious.",

    "text": "When I first walked in on a Friday night, an hour before they were closing, I was just surprised that my friend and I were the only ones here. It made me think twice about how fresh the fish can be if there is no turnover. We order the sushi sushi lover for two which seemed like the best deal since it came with miso soup and green tea as well as 28 pieces of sushi. It consisted of two 6 piece rolls (tuna + salmon) as well as 16 other sushi pieces (8 unique pieces, so 2 of each). The toro was great while the salmon in the salmon roll was a little tough for my liking. The fish came out in a nice cool temperature, not too cold and not too warm and the stickiness of the rice complemented it pretty well.  For dessert, I saw that tempura ice cream (they bread a scoop of ice cream and fry it) was on the menu and I'm always a fan of fried ice cream so I gave it a try. It was definitely not worth the $7.50 price tag. I think you can do better elsewhere if you've never had fried ice cream before.  Overall, I'd say this place is pretty expensive and not the best value you can find but considering it is in station square, that's how it is down there. Service was great, considering we were the only patrons in there for a good 20 minutes until thankfully another party of 2 came in so it wouldn't be awkward.   I would give this place 3.5 stars but since I can't, I'll bump it up to 4 and call it self-justifying the quality of the restaurant due to the amount of money we had to fork out in the end for 2 people.",

Well, maybe it's the fact that they overcharge for the amount of food they give you.  Quality is good, but the portions are too small for what you pay.  You also have to pay for parking (in the garage).   There's not too many Japanese restaurants in Pittsburgh, so if you're in the mood for Japanese,  it's virtually the only place to go.",

    "text": "I came here once on a first date and have been hooked on the food ever since.  That first night, we ordered the Sushi Lover for two that came with a wide variety of sushi and rolls as well as Miso soup.  That was my first time trying out such a variety of sashimi style sushi, so it was really nice to have so many different types of pieces at the same time.  You get two six-piece rolls and two pieces of 8 different types of sushi so you and your dining partner can each have a taste of everything.  As far as the atmosphere is concerned, this place has always been very quiet and the service has been pretty great.  It was a good choice for a first date (we didn't have to strain to hear each other as we talked).  The food does, however, take some time to prepare so if you are ravenous and in dire need of food ASAP, I wouldn't come here since you'll be waiting a while for the sushi.  It is a bit more expensive than I'm used to, so I've resorted to using the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> gift certificates; you can get $25 certificates for meals of  more than $35 on there pretty cheaply.  Buy them at the beginning of the month since they seem to sell out on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> and all that is left are the $10 off ones for lunch.    I don't eat much in one sitting, so I tend to get one of the combo meals that has the teriyaki chicken.  That way I can eat the sushi and Miso soup at the restaurant, but can take the chicken home and reheat it; it reheats very well.    Love the homemade, low-sodium soy sauce!",

    "text": "Went there with my hubby for his birthday and we were pleasantly surprised.   The sushi chef is actually Japanese, and you can really tell from the quality and authenticity of the food. The miso soup is REAL miso soup, not that watered down powdered stuff with tiny bits of chopped up tofu that you get in a lot of Japanese restaurants.  You won't find anything too fancy on the menu as most of the offerings are pretty standard fare for a Japanese restaurant. For an appetizer we had the beef tataki which was very flavorful. We had the sushi lover for two with 28 pieces of maki and nigiri. It came with two pieces of the fattiest fatty tuna (toro) that I have EVER seen and it literally melted in my mouth! I've eaten a lot of sushi in my life and I was absolutely shocked. We finished off our meal with some fried ice cream in a yummy smooth red bean sauce. The server was really nice too and knew the menu really well.   Overall we left extremely satisfied - it helped that we had a $25 <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate (otherwise it would have been too pricey to try the place). It was very high quality and authentic sushi, as well as a pleasant dining experience. I think this place is highly underrated, probably because of the high prices and shopping mall location, but next time you're craving great Japanese food, get yourself a restaurant certificate and try it out!",

    "text": "Short review: If you are from out of town and you know what good sushi tastes like, don't bother with Kiku. It's expensive and mediocre at best.   Open question to Kiku: Where do you get off not listing your sashimi prices and then charging as much for four pieces of tuna as you do for one of your higher priced specialty rolls? Seriously, please show me on a map.  Long review: The fish is fresh and the rolls are decent. I really don't know what else to say in praise of this place that seems to be getting a ton of 4 stars. I was certainly underwhelmed. It's all pretty standard stuff ... nothing to get excited about. I only went in here because it was in walking distance of my hotel and I was craving fish and rice to soothe a Yuengling hangover. If it hadn't been for really bad service and ridiculous prices I would have chalked it up to a ho-hum experience. Maybe I'm just used to living in CA where there's literally about a million easily accessible sushi places that are just as good or way better than Kiku, but ... I was left hardly satisfied and a more than a bit irritated after leaving.   I sat down at the bar and was immediately told they had no rice. What? How does a sushi restaurant even run out of rice? Are you kidding? WHAT ARE YOU DOING, KIKU? GET YOUR LIFE RIGHT!  So anyway I was told I'd have to wait ten minutes. No big deal, I ordered some sashimi, since you don't need rice for that. I got 4 pieces of tuna. It was good. Then ten minutes went by. Then ten more. During this time no one asked me if I wanted any other appetizers or something from the kitchen. Getting really bored and hungry. Finally after twenty minutes the rice is ready. So I order a spider roll. At this point someone actually asks if I want appetizers. Wow, you catch on REAL quick, Kiku server. I say no, I just want my roll. The sushi chef proceeds to make a handroll and give it to the other person at the bar who came in after me. Oh, also this guy got served miso soup and appetizers very quickly, while no one was even asking me if I wanted anything. WTF, Kiku? The restaurant was less than half full so why was I completely ignored for twenty minutes? GET YOUR LIFE RIGHT, KIKU! Then the sushi chef proceeds to make about 4 more sushi plates to send out to tables right in front of my face instead of serving me. God, I was sitting right there, obviously starving and only wanting one thing! One god damned thing! If I had known I'd have to wait even more while literally every other person in the restaurant got served, maybe I would have gotten an appetizer.  So, whatever. I finally get my spider roll. It was very small compared to what I'm used to. It tasted ... ok ... I thought it had too much tempura batter, skimpy portion of crab, and the mayo sauce had no flavor ... but whatever. Fine. I didn't expect much from a place in a freaking strip mall. I was really irritated and still hungry at this point so I flagged down a server and ordered a small miso and requested the check as soon as possible. At this point she also seemed to notice my soda that had been empty for about 15 minutes. She took it away for a refill without asking me if I wanted one. I didn't. I just wanted water or perhaps nothing since I wanted to leave ASAP. But whatever. Fine.   Then the check came and the real inner rage began. Thirty-six f*ing dollars for 4 pieces of tuna, a spider roll, a small miso, and a coke. WTF. Lunch alone on a Wednesday just cost me $36. As hungry as I still was, I was very glad I had not ordered any other food since apparently they are charging premium prices for this utterly forgettable food. I knew the spider roll would be 14, but 14 dollars for four pieces of tuna sashimi. REALLY?? REALLY?? You might be thinking this was entirely avoidable, but there are no listed prices for sashimi on their menu. I'm used to paying about 10 dollars for six pieces of sashimi at home so I made an educated estimate that 4 pieces of tuna might be about 8 dollars. It's not. Not at Kiku anyway. For 14 f*ing dollars I want the avocado, cucumber, and rice that would have come with the Tokyo roll. How on earth does a very small portion of sashimi cost the same as one of the restaurant's specialty rolls? HOW, KIKU? RIDDLE ME THAT!  For the record a diet coke cost me 2.75. Apparently I was not charged for my unwanted refill, so at least I didn't get raped for two of those. Needless to say I didn't stick around to drink the soda and I left a huge 0 for the tip. Honestly I felt like that was generous since what I really wanted to do was fight over the bill and get my money back.   So, I shall conclude this review with a gigantic F U to Kiku restaurant.",
