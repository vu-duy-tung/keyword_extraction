We were seated right away (given we had to sit outside in the cold) and split a $16 lobster roll. When it came out, I was kind of like.... \"that's it?\" Nonetheless, we split it.  There just wasn't that much lobster in it. And the lobster in it..was just ok. And then it was on some greasy garlic bread. I don't know...I just wasn't a fan. Plus, our waitress took forever to show up again...  I don't know, I wasn't too impressed with Roland's, but maybe I haven't tried what other things it may have to offer?",

Five of us went there Friday evening 08/15 and our name was put on the list fir a table so we went to the bar to have a drink and wait. While there were 2 empty tables in the same area we were waiting we never got seated. The hostess came and ask us if we still wanted a table and we told he yes but after about 30 minutes one girl went to ask and saw her name was marked out but the hostess told her we would be next but she had to seat the family of 5 who she said were there before us.  We knew they weren't but we said ok. After another 2 tables in the area we were waiting emptied another girl went to the hostess and asked if we were going to be seated and she was told you're next. But I have to seat these people first because they were here first. That was a lie because we wAtched them walk in the door   So finally a manager came over and told us we could sit in the bar area were there were now 6 empty tables or on the dining room side where we could see there were empty tables and booths. By that time we were too mad to stay and starred to leave.  As we were walking out the door the hostess said (in a hateful voice) I was going to get you a table!  Worst customer service ever and by the way all 5 of us are postal workers and we know what good customer service is   Maybe the hostess should be working in the back where she doesn't have to interact with customers",

    "text": "Let's see.... Rolands can be fun to go to for happy hour after work on Friday.  Heck they used to have these two bartenders that if you were a good looking girl at least one would give you a beer or two but making up the difference by overcharging or flat out giving incorrect change back to some male patrons.  Anyhow, they have a somewhat unique upstairs and in the summer they have the balcony that you can sit out on.  One summer night it began to storm and one of their umbrellas flew off the base and cracked me in the head.  I though I was going to pass out, but the bartender just came out gathered the pieces and put them back together folding the umbrella down.  Yea no reason to apologize I just could have been decapitated.  \\ Now onto the food.....uh  well....my best suggestion is, if you are on a timed lunch or have limited time for dinner, PICK SOMEWHERE ELSE!  you will only get frustrated with the SLOW AS HELL service.  Suggestions, hmm not entirely sure since nothing I ate here impressed me much.  The lobster roll, I am certain wasn't \"real\" lobster and was very rubbery, and dry.  Way too much bun to lobster type meat, and overpriced for a sandwich, $15.00 I think.  Next we got the oysters.  6  were supposed to be in an order but they only delivered 5.  But good luck finding the waitress, she showed up 3x's in the hour and half that we were there for dinner.  Not because it took us an hour and half to eat but 15 minutes to get waited on.  15 more minutes for drinks, and to order.  45 minutes for food to come, and I think you get the picture... I wouldn't eat here again, there are many other places to choose from.  Lastly I ordered a draft beer it was warm, told the waiter who got me a bottle but still charged me for both... NICE...",

The mussels are fresh and they really do give you a whole lot, but there's not too much broth (The best part of ordering mussels is usually sopping up the broth with bread). The lobster roll has plenty of lobster, it's fresh and tasty, but the roll itself is a bit greasy. It didn't bother me that much, but some people seem to be put off by it.    My wife ordered the \"stuffed shrimp platter,\" which I put in quotes because the \"platter\" consists of 5 medium/small overcooked rubbery shrimp and some unseasoned overcooked veggies. They charge like $23 for this, which is a complete ripoff.   The service is spotty, and sometimes people feel the need to smoke standing right next to you if you are seated outside, which is really enjoyable (bleh).",

We didn't realize most of the restaurants are closed on Mondays. Tried Thin Man, closed. Luke Wholey's, closed. We read some less than appealing outdoor menus of a few spots and settled on Roland's Seafood Grill for lunch because they were open and had a sign out front raving about their signature warm Lobster Rolls for $14.99. Ok, we were game.  We've driven hours off the beaten path in Maine for amazing Lobster Rolls at Red's Eats, which sets the standard for what all lobster rolls should be. Massive amounts of fresh lobster piled on top of the bun and drawn butter to dip the excess mound of lobster in is a mouth watering delight!   That couldn't be farther from what you get served at Roland's. The bun was Mancini's, so good start. The lobster was an odd orange color that's not what fresh lobster looks like at all. Nothing was heaped over the bun at all, but honestly after tasting it that part was ok. Combination of a few fresher tasting pieces, some rubbery pieces, and some dry pieces that literally could have been any fish. I skipped the fries, which didn't look all that great on hubby's plate and there was the tiniest container of coleslaw ever as a side that was actually pretty good. Considering I skipped the fries, shouldn't the server have asked if I wanted extra coleslaw knowing it was going to be minuscule?   The upstairs patio was really nice overlooking Penn Ave. and I hear they have a decent happy hour with terrific specials on fresh oysters and beer at the bar. I may give this place another shot based on that but, never again on their lobster roll.",

That means you have to order bottled beer from the waitress but can go downstairs and order draft beers.  That's sort of weird.  Anywho-- I had a caesar salad and french onion soup.  Both were tasty, and the other people in my party liked their food too-- pizza and burgers.  The waitress was super friendly.  I'd like to go back and enjoy their upstairs patio & a lobster roll!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I visited on a Saturday afternoon. We tried mussels, clam chowder, jumbo shrimp cocktail and a burger.  The mussels were an appetizer portion and were enough for three people. They were perfectly cooked and very sweet.  The shrimp are sold a la carte. I ordered 6 of them, and was a bit let down that 2 of them were a bit dry. The cocktail sauce served with the shrimp had wonderfully spicy horseradish and was perfect.  The New England clam chowder was not overly thick and had lots of clams in it. Lastly, the burger, topped with gorgonzola cheese came with fries and cole slaw and was excellent.  The only reason I give this review 3 stars is because our waiter got overwhelmed by a few large parties and disappeared on us.  We had to flag down the hostess to get our waiter to bring us our check. Other than some dry shrimp, and the service issue, we had an enjoyable dinner.",

It took a couple of tries to get refills on drinks I asked for a cup of water I didn't even get the cup of water the pasta was more like wedding soup my medium stake was almost completely pink all the way through very undercooked my nieces pasta had more onions in it then it had sauce I will never visit this place again!!! It wasn't that busy tonight but we stood there for almost 15 minutes waiting for them to get us a table. I spoke with the manager and explained my concerns to him I just can't see me spending that kind of money for the experience that I had tonight again.",

The lobster roll is expensive, but well worth it....whereas many lobster rolls are loaded with mayo this one is just large , well seasoned chunks of claw and tail meat on a great roll. Upstairs is great because ... well... the bartenders treat everyone like friends. I have left many times with several craft beers for under $10. The bartenders are also really cool because every now and then they will give you a free beer :)",

I expected it to be quite crowded during dinner time, however arriving at 6:30 there was no wait for 3.  The lobster roll was pretty good, although I do remember it being better. I wished that there was something extra on the sandwich, such as melted butter. And they raised the price a dollar.  Roland's has a huge draft beer selection. Each of us tried a different beer and they were reasonably priced, around $4.50 each.  I would definitely go back, but not any time soon.",

To start our server very friendly but winey I don't care who didn't show up to prep or that the manager had to take tables.  we ordered two ice teas the lobster roll and the filet sandwich each came with fries and slaw.  Well I went to get sugar out of the sugar caddy to find a blood stained band aid stuffed in it, that should have signaled me to leave, but I didn't. we each got our sandwich the fresh cut fries were so cold and hard they had been sitting for awhile. the filet sandwich was good but my lobster roll was so fishey and the bread was saturated with butter it was dripping. Then halfway through lunching one of the umbrellas from the upper roof top deck blew off into the street. it was almost impossible to pay we had to go inside and hunt down the server, the sink in the ladies room was missing the hot water handle. Overall pretty crappy considering I had this lobster roll about three years ago and it was fantastic",

Our leader asked if we could be seated elsewhere so that we could chat with one another. It was after 5 and the hostess said we could go to another room but we had to be out of there by 6:30. Everyone agreed.  The waitress came and took drink orders first.  When she went to serve us she spilled a beverage right over the table narrowly missing me but hit someone sitting diagonal to me  I thought this was a normal mishap and the area was cleaned up properly.  I was very hesitant about what I wanted to order and decided upon a vegetable salad. Our leader normally treats us to an appetizer and in this case it was chicken nachos. I tried one but could  not taste the chicken but otherwise it tasted okay.  Later when our waitress began serving our main courses I noticed she was spilling sauces on the floor before being placed in front of the guest. I was grateful I ordered a salad. It was nothing out of the ordinary but you could get this same salad anywhere. The person next to me ordered the beer battered giant fish sandwich. He offered me a piece to try and when I bit into it all I could taste was the beer batter. No fish. Enough said.  I was done with my meal and noticed it was 6:20 so I told the group it was time to get up and go so they could have this table.  This is certainly not a place I will go to on my own. There are much better establishments in the area.",

The food tastes bland, chewy and microwaved whether it's seafood or a pizza or fries. Cafeteria food that's been sat out all day tastes better. I just don't get it. They have a primo location in the heart of the Strip. I also don't understand how they're still in business and often crowded.

I have had dinner and had drinks at many, many different restaurants, but the service here was some of the worst that I've experienced in my entire life. A good sized group (probably 15 or so by the time we left) was gathered upstairs near the bar. So here's what happened:  -Stood at the bar waiting for 5-10 minutes to be served as bartenders walked by, ignoring us -Received grumbling responses from bartenders when we asked for assistance  -Asked for menus and was told that \"food would take at least 30-40 minutes\" to be served -Food arrived and was left at the bar to get cold, later told that the bartender \"didn't see where we were\" - we were standing literally 6 feet away from where we had ordered -A friend's food was thrown away - uneaten - immediately after delivery because \"it looked like she was done\"  What a horrible experience. Thankfully, our later stops were much better. I never plan to return to Roland's and am disappointed that such a well-known Pittsburgh establishment would have such sub-par service.",

I wasn't really crazy about trying a seafood place in Pittsburgh, should have gone with my gut, I'm sure it would be thanking me now. I had the shrimp and grits. The cheese grits were dry, over cooked and fairly tasteless. The shrimp were by far the worst part in that they were so undercooked I could not eat past the first bite. Looks like a great place to have a drink with friends, but keep the crowd small as they could not seat us all together.

We had 11 shots and the bartender gave me two pint glasses to thank us for spending three digits on one second's worth of alcohol consumption :) The bathroom was clean, the bartender was cool, and we were in and out of there with our big group in under ten minutes. Got mean mugged by a few families that might have been jealous of all our fun-having, but hey- it seemed like a cool place and I wouldn't mind cozying up to the bar for a cheap beer if I was a local!",

The bartender was great, very attentive & helpful on offering suggestions for places to go. We had pizza and lobster Mac & cheese that were OK, my friend said the latter was a bit bland and needed salt & pepper but we were coming from NY so hard to compete with that. The margarita pizza was decent but could've used more cheese especially since there were about 2 pieces with a section missing cheese. Also have 2 upstairs pool tables to rent for only 3$/half hour. Definitely seems like a cool hang out spot.",

Thankfully they serve a few chicken dishes and the pizzas looked good.  I opted for the Grilled Chicken Nachos,  while my hubby got a bowl of Clam Chowder & Lobster Roll Sliders.   We decided to sit at the upstairs bar, which only had a couple of other people at it.  The bartender seemed a little odd,  but nice nonetheless. We didn't get a ton of attention,  despite the place being pretty empty,  but that's OK because I didn't really feel like being bothered. I ordered a Stoli with orange juice and hubs got a Bloody Mary.  I was pretty surprised that he wasn't asked if he wanted it spicy or not and it looked spicy, which he doesn't care much for. As a server & bartender I realize how important asking if someone wants a spicy BM is. Neither of us finished our drinks as mine was way too strong and his was too spicy.   We took most of our food home since there was so much. Lunch and 2 drinks ran us about $47 before tip.  Can't decide if I will be back or not,  but it is possible.",

It was mid March (and not hot outside) and they kept the patio doors open. I repeatedly asked them to close them completely since myself and friends were cold and they would not.   The only way to describe the food is disgusting. -I split the giant beer battered fish sandwich. Given that apparently this place is a seafood place one would think their seafood should be decent... wrong. The fries were cold, and the sandwich and fries were very greasy.  - Our friends got the classic white pizza. Between two of them they finished one piece and couldn't tolerate anymore. I tried a bite of it. It tasted like you were eating a clove of garlic with a bit of dough.  - No one else enjoyed their meals either.  The waiter was terrible. He would take a couple peoples drink or food order and then walk away and repeated this throughout the night. He was not friendly and when we needed something he was no where to be found. Some of the people we were with left early. We had to ask him to clear their cups so  we could move into their space. When he was clearing the table at the end he noticed there was the majority of the pizza left. He asked our friends if they wanted it packed up. They said they didn't like it so they don't want to take it home. He said ok. Thats it- didn't ask why, didn't offer to take it off their bill, didn't apologize, nothing!  Overall the food, service, and atmosphere deserve 1 star. I would not recommend them. In fact, I would go out of my way to make sure no one I know would have to suffer through gain to Rolands.",

On this most recent visit I ordered the raspberry maple scallop appetizer as my meal. It was a large portion;I could not finish it and my fellow diners were too stuffed to help me. One member of my group ordered the seafood pizza and crushed it-said it was so tasty. My other fellow diner order the stuffed banana pepper app and also said it was good. They have a wide draft selection and if you get there early enough you can grab a seat near the tvs. The bar is usually too crowded to grab a seat at but our service at our table was attentive and quick. On a previous visit, I split a margarita pizza and it was good too so there is a variety of entrees/apps etc to choose from to please any palate.",

Let's start with the beer: I ordered a Coors Light which was very warm. I didnt think much of it, and ordered one of their IPA's off of their extensive beer menu. ( I was impressed)  The IPA was warm.    My girlfriend and I went here and I had the sea and land (lobster stuffed with crab meat and a sirloin steak) with mashed potatoes. She had scallops and shrimp.   I got my steak, which I ordered medium rare, and it was rare, still bleeding. The Lobster was the only good thing about the experience. The mashed potatoes were dry and had no taste.   My girlfriend got halfway through her dinner and had to excuse herself because she got sick.   I don't mind paying $100 for dinner, but I expected a lot more.   I won't be going back.",

It was by far the worst experience at a restaurant I have had. My husband and I both ordered the Lobster Rolls and I order my daughter pasta from the kids menu. It took the staff SO LONG to bring our lunch and when it finally came, my husband and I both got our sandwiches, but my daughter got nothing. Of course she was not happy about that at all, and trying to calm her down, we were giving her our food so that she had something, but she really wanted her pasta. My husband went to talk to the manager, and our server came over but STILL NO PASTA. 15-20 minutes later the pasta finally came out. And of course it was scalding hot. Not only was the pasta so hot that it was inedible (especially for a kid) there was a POOL of greasy butter and oil in the bottom of the bowl. I think my kid ate more of the grease than the actual pasta. It was DISGUSTING. This was such an absolutely horribly disappointment of a restaurant. Not to mention that the lobster roll was not even that great and definitely not worth $16. (Maybe it would have been better if it didn't sit on my plate for twenty minutes while I waited for my daughter's food).   Don't waste your time here, especially if you have kids. The staff (minus our waitress who was really nice and it wasn't her fault) are a bunch of bozos.",

My dad order the clam chowder soup, which was chunky and bare of any clams.  My mom and I shared a couple of appetizers, the calamari was great but the crab cake was just ok and a bit salty.  Service gets 2 stars and Food gets 3 stars.  Overall, this place gets a 2.5 stars.  If you are caught in the rain and do not have any other choices in the strip area, stop by.  I would recommend scoping out the other restaurants in the area.",

The quality was what you would find if you were ordering from a bar...but it was twice as expensive. The $16 I paid for fried cod got me two soggy cod filets, steamed bland vegetables and boring roasted potatoes. I couldn't have tried to make food this poor. It was a Sysco food operation gone wrong: runoff from Houlihan's mixed with Joe's Crab Shack.   The service was so slow that we were cancelling orders due to the delay in bringing them to the table. My dish arrived without any sort of sauce, and we even had to get up and order beer from the bar because our waitress was so behind. It was her \"second day on the job,\" but this is unacceptable. They could have at least comp'd our beers, or offered some other way to make it up (besides coming over to informing us that they had charged the beers to our bill).  Roland's had space available on a Monday night, unlike the other restaurants in the neighborhood. This was really convenient initially, but I now have an idea of why this was the case.",

The shrimp were cooked thoroughly but not overcooked or rubbery and they were de-veined which is the mark of a place that knows what are doing.  I'm from FL originally so I'm picky about that.  Try the shrimp with the horseradish and cocktail sauce mixed they give you and it will definitely clear out your sinuses!  My wife had the beer battered fish sandwich, it was great and it had so much cod she gave me half of it just so she could actually fit it on the bun.  This place also has a 4 for $12 Corona special.

My brother and I came in here on Sunday because we were hungry after a day of walking around the strip. Worst decision we have ever made; we actually laughed at how nasty it was. I think that the calamari we were served was actually pieces of chopped up and dyed car tire. Then, my brother got the prosciutto and arugula pizza. there were like 2 pieces of prosciutto on it, and then they thought it would be a good idea to literally just throw pieces of ice cold arugula on top with unmelted parm cheese and some sort of lemon sauce. it was nasty. My chicken sandwhich was also made with rubber chicken. truly a horrifying experience. Oh, and they seated us in a huge room, alone, it was so awkward and the waitress was rude and short. THIS FOOD TASES LIKE PLASTIC. OH YEAH AND THE FRENCH FRIES WERE LITERALLY SOGGY PIECES OF MOIST PLASTIC  HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. do not go here unless you want to throw up",

    "text": "I think a solid 3 stars is a good way to explain and the reason is because there were really great things and really horrible things.   First, we were starving when we pulled in here. Like so fricken hungry we ordered a ton of food lol. So we got the calamari and it was the worst calamari, maybe even the worst seafood, I have ever had. Now, being a seafood place you would think this wouldn't happen. It was sooooo over cooked that it tasted like a rubber band. Then I got a side salad and my husband got a bowl of clam chowder. Salad was great, fresh and the peppercorn dressing was extremely tasty. My husbands chowder....the best soup I have ever had! It was creamy and had a ton of clams in it. I mean it, the best clam chowder by far I have ever had! So at this point we were confused. So I got an Italian style pizza with spicy sausage which, I have to say wasn't bad. The sausage had a kick and it was a crispy crust. The sauce lacked a little, prob just tomatoes. My husband got their famous hot lobster roll and, just like everything else, was enormous and it was pretty good. Roll was buttery and the lobster was cooked well.   The service wasn't bad, just extremely slow. So I really was confused by this place so the only thing I knew what to was to give it 3 stars bc I have no idea if I would come back or not? Maybe the calamari was a mistake? I just don't know. I would come back for the soup for sure...but for a seafood place to mess up fried calamari as an appetizer...come on!",

I was seated promptly and given a drink and food menu.  I noticed the beer sampler and thought I would give it a try. I asked the server if I could choose the beers and she said yes.  She went on to explain nearly most of the draft beers I selected were not available as they were having trouble with their taps.   I ordered a flight of beers that arrived after 10 minutes and began tasting them.  They were cold but did not taste fresh.  Next I ordered the famous \"Lobster Roll\" which comes with fries and slaw.  It took nearly 20 minutes for my food to arrive but looked good at first glance.  The fries were plentiful and hot but greasy.  The lobster roll was served in a large piece of bread that resembled two uncut pieces of Texas toast.  It was buttered and grilled to give it a nice appearance.  The lobster inside was a small amount, cold and tough. The slaw was reasonably good and cold.   The server came back and I ordered a pint of draft beer.  After nearly another 20 minutes she returned, apologized and explained they were having more problems with their tap system and offered me a bottle of Guinness instead of the draft I ordered.  At this point I politely explained I did not want the bottled version and asked for the check.    I would be hard pressed to ever return.  With other great restaurant choices in the area I don't understand why anyone would choose to eat at Roland's Seafood Grill.",

For food, we ordered clam chowder, a hot lobster roll, and a fish sandwich. The clam chowder was really tasty with good consistency and was a huge serving, much larger than we expected. The hot lobster roll was rich, buttery, and warm, and the lobster was good and fresh. The fish sandwich was gigantic... two huge fillets breaded and fried with tons of french fries. It was a little greasy but pretty tasty. Overall, I was happy with lunch and with the service and I would probably go again for the lobster roll or the clam chowder.",

Our server was really nice and recommended great choices from the draft beer list but the service was still pretty slow, probably due to the lunch rush. We just wanted a quick bite to eat so we just ordered some hot wings and a few appetizers. We tried the Crab Spinach and Artichoke Dip which was really tasty but was severely lacking on the crab. It was thick, had great flavor, and was served with the perfect toasted French bread but the crab was just not there which was pretty disappointing. We also tried the Calamari which was lightly breaded and each piece was the size of a jumbo shrimp! The wings were good too but nothing to write home about. The food was tasty and filling but nothing spectacular.",

Appetizer #1 showed up, no drinks or silverware. Appetizer #2 showed up from the raw bar still no drinks or silverware. Finally got silverware to eat after the first appetizer had been on the table for 10 minutes.   Food came later on wife had the lobster roll or should I say little bit of lobster on a whole lot of Texas toast style bun, the bread and garlic overwhelmed the taste of the lobster. The waitress told my wife she thrower her side of fries away because they looked bad, her replacement side never showed up until I was finished eating my dinner and she was almost done.   I ordered the surf and turf filet and crab cake. Steak was cooked correctly but nothing special about it and the advertised Lump Crab Cake is no where near a real lump style cake.  Not the best service and food.",

We last stopped here on New Years Eve before dinner at a nearby restaurant.  They have a full food menu at Rolands but looking at other reviews and taking to other people that have eaten here I prefer to just order drinks here.     I think this is a good place to watch a sporting event at.  It's usually always busy and a good atmosphere for a big game.  The both upstairs and downstairs bars are laid out nice and open.  The televisions are big and you can easily see them.  I like that a lot.     Good for Rolands that they are busy and the bar is always crowded.  It's just hard to get a beer most of the time.  I don't know if the bartender's are just overwhelmed or not paying attention but it has been difficult to get a drink at first every time I come in here.     They usually have a good amount of drinks on tap which is nice.  If you have a large group the can accommodate you too.  We have had some unofficial events after work here that have been nice.  I just wouldn't order any food here unless I was really hungry and needed an appetizer or something small to get by.         So if you're looking for a good place to hang out and watch some sports with some friends I recommend coming here to have some drinks but there are better places to eat close by in the Strip.",

I didn't think it could get any worse....but it did. He brought us waters first then our beers, little did we know these were the only drinks we would get. The restaurant's doors were open and the day was hot and humid, perfect for enjoying a lobster roll and cold beer. Our waiter brought our food, we ordered a second round and he was never seen again. I witnessed more apologies to customers that day than I ever have. It wasn't even crowded. Having my own experience in the food service industry, I realize how hard this job can be but this was unacceptable. The type of service you receive will make or break a restaurant and I highly doubt we will be back. This was our second terrible visit and I am not willing to give a third strike chance.",

The first thing that caught my attention was how the waitresses/waiters were dressed. They weren't dressed how I would have expected them to be. They were in jeans and baggy tshirts. But, our waitress was helpful, and our food came out pretty quickly. it wasn't a memorable meal or experience. I wanted a caesar salad with my dinner, but they were out of romaine lettuce (and it wasn't late in the evening--maybe 6:30pm at the latest). The bleu cheese dressing, though, tasted pretty good. I ordered a ravioli dish for my entree, but when I asked if I could get a different sauce, the waitress said it's already mixed together, meh. I'm not a fan of that. When my friends went to order their pasta dishes, they had a choice between penne and linguini, but the restaurant was out of penne, too.  Oh well, the prices aren't terrible, and the good came out pretty quickly, and hot. It's not the best restaurant, but it's not a stink hole, either.",

We ordered 2 beers and 2 fish sandwiches.......the beer was luke-warm....it came out of the tap with so much foam I could tell before he sat it down in front of me.....then he tried to argue the fact that the beer was warm.....NOT A GOOD START! He finally conceded to replace the beer with some that were a little colder (but not much) and gave a lame explanation to why the temp was not right, took our order and then we waited, and waited, and waited for about 45mins for our sandwiches to come out...... I want to say the fish was very hot, but it was also very greasy as if they fried it and then refried it then let it sit in the dirty brown grease...not to mention the fries were very cold. So after waiting another 15-20mins the bartender asked how is the food....of course we complained know we waited 15 more mins to talk the manager TIM.....he was snarky and sarcastic....when we told him the fish was greasy he returned with \"well it is fried in grease\".....DUH! TIM! we kinda knew that!......needless to say we did not finish our beer or our food....we went down the street to Wholey's and got a hot fish sandwich minus the grease.",

Be warned - the service usually mediocre, but the food will more than compensate!",

No, it is perfectly fine in my book!  I got the lobster roll, plenty of lobster on a garlic bread roll.  It was just ok.    The most annoying part was the host kept coming out to talk to me.  I really just wanted to chill out by myself, not get hit on by the creepy host!",

    "text": "We arrived around 4:30 on a Wednesday before the Jason Isbell show at the Benedum, and it seemed like they were just opening. Only a couple of other couples there and a guy at the bar. No host and the bartender asked if we were going to eat. Sure man, it's a restaurant, right? Go figure... We were told to just sit anywhere and someone would be right with us. After  about 15 minutes no one came to our table so I started to get up and go to the bar for a menu, but a server saw me getting up and came over. Asked our server for a beer menu and was told they didn't have any. Really? My girlfriend looked around and found one lying on another table. Strike two. Ordered the lobster Mac n cheese as an appetizer. DEFINITELY not enough for two people to split, even as an appetizer, which was ok with us because we both thought it was pretty bland and should have just been called \"Mac n cheese\" because Sherlock Holmes would have had a tough time finding lobster in there. For dinner I ordered the pan seared scallops with red mashed potatoes. I think it was $23 or something like that which was INSANE for what I got, which was 8 single-bite sized, overcooked and completely flavorless pieces and a small mound of cold potatoes. Extremely disappointed in this dish. The other half got the prosciutto and arugula pizza. When it came to the table, completely topped with raw arugula about an inch deep, I was skeptical and didn't even try it until we got home later that night. I was wrong about this one and the pizza was delicious and on point. After my first round I did sit beerless  for about 15 minutes before one of our two servers came by to see if I wanted another (I did), but other than that they were fairly attentive, even though they both gave us a vibe that they were somehow annoyed that we were there. Our total bill for dinner, appetizer and 4 draft beers came to just over $80, which was way too steep considering the quality of food and service. Maybe we'd go back to grab a drink at the bar, but for food there are much better choices in the strip district.",

The dinner salad consisted of brown and white lettuce and cafeteria-esque Italian dressing. Our two meals of pasta were so bland that we, almost simultaneously, asked each other to try a bite just to make sure we weren't missing something. And I have been known to enjoy a dinner of buttered noodles, but our pastas weren't even as flavorful as that! Once we finished, our waitress said, \"I hope you didn't want dessert because we're out.\"  So classy. The last straw was being reminded of what we would have to pay for such a crappy meal. Never again.",

    "text": "Giving 2 stars is strictly because I didn't get sick from the food....this night was a trainwreck start to finish.  My Mother and brother were coming to visit me from Ohio and I had scouted out a place for a long time to take them for my Mothers birthday dinner and since they both loved seafood I thought this would be a fun place for my \"tourist\" family.   When I walked in I took my Mom right over to the raw bar so she could see some flair....the bar looked aweful and empty but hey we don't judge so long as we have a good night. So scooted my Mom away from there and tried to shake off the embarrassment.  When we were sat my brother asked for the beer list...the server scrambled and said everything on their huge chalkboard was wrong and gave him a dirty crusty drink menu. He orded his beer and I a glass of wine and my Mother a water.  10 minutes later I was told they were out of my wine so I decided to stick with water.  We put in our order a starter plate to share, 2 salads, a pizza, scampi, and pasta. As a server I would be on cloud nine from this perfect check and work extra hard for that tip.   Then the waiting started 20 minutes for the starter which was great then 20 more for 2 salads.  Then things start going way down hill.  My Mom asked for some more water then we watched our waitress fill 2 other drinks at tables and bring out shots for another....still no water...since its my Mother I gave her mine and started trying to wave down our server. Finally my brother got her attention she said she forgot and went and got another one ignoring the fact mine was now empty. Whatever I'm a sever I understand things happen. Then we start to realize its been about 25 minutes since the salads came out. We ask what is going on and they said it would be there soon...they weren't lying my Brothers dinner came out a few minutes later....ONLY his dinner.  So we watch him eat, try his food, and wait.  He finishes his dinner which was pretty damn good and we ask what's going on the server says she is sorry they are backed up and she will take off our drinks (so basically one beer). Finally about 10 minutes later the pizza comes out....no pasta. We ask where it is and no one has an answer. I have to excuse myself and use the restroom and apparently when I was gone the manager explain that it hasn't even been started yet!!!!!!!! Then he said he will pay for it (pay for the food I'm never going to get how thoughtful). We ask for a box for the pizza because at this time we have been here for almost an hour and a half and I had some tourist to show around. It takes another 20 minutes to get the check and boxes...we pay and the server says she will run and see if the pasta is up (eventhough we just really wanted to leave) 15 minutes later she comes back with some pasta and a proud smile. Well thanks dear...wish we had that much effort all night.   The most annoying part of this ENTIRE dinner is that for 2 hours not the server or manager or anyone really stepped up to the plate here.  Yes they took off a meal we no longer wanted and one beer but I feel that since not one thing was right about the entire night something should have been done...maybe at least an apology. My brother and I work as servers and nothing like this has ever happened to one of our customers or if it has even come close within the first 30 minutes we would have fixed it.   I'm sorry Rolands but we will never be back and I REALLY wanted to love you. :(",

They did not charge for the room, only food and drink which were very reasonably priced. Surprisingly, as part of the event took place during happy hour, drinks during that time were much cheaper.

We got the calamari and the spinach, artichoke, & crab dip to start off, the calamari was good but the peppers and onions were kinda soggy and the dip was good but beware it's really cheesy, like cream cheese cheesy, and you could barely taste the crab, but the bread it came with was good! I got a lobster roll as an entree, my boyfriend got the shrimp po boy, his sister got the chicken nachos, and her boyfriend got mild wings. Everyone enjoyed their food, was good portions and super yummy. I really loved the fries my entree came with, the only thing about the sandwiches are that the bread is super thick and can be super hard to eat, other than that the fillings are yummmmmy. The nachos were HUGE and the wings were crispy and tasty. Our server was super nice and attentive. And best of all, we got to sit at the patio upstairs on a very nice day :) Would totally come back.",

Service was okay not the greatest but not the worst either. Waitress came off as kind of nonchalant, but she checked on us throughout our meal and according to other reviews doesn't look like they even got that. Kitchen staff was slow in execution especially for not having a big crowd.   I wasn't in the mood for seafood so I opted to try other things on their menu   LOBSTER BISQUE --  Huge portion. I didn't expect to get as much in the bowl as I actually got. Although shallow, the bowl is large and you get a pretty decent serving in it. Despite the size, the flavor was lacking as well as texture. I've had some pretty delicious basques before and think it could be improved with a pinch of salt and corn for texture. It's missing something.   GARLIC PARM WINGS --  Got an order of wings and they were good. Not an over powering flavor of garlic and not super duper oily. They used real garlic and it was served with it - minced. The wings were deep fried to a nice crispness so it added a little crunch which I liked. Served with common celery and your choice of rand and blue cheese. Not bad.   MARGHERITA PIZZA -- Looks better than it tastes. This can be easily split between two people - not a single server. The pizza is cooked in a wood fired oven and made very thin so it gets a nice crispy crunch. The crust was actually very good. It has a good texture to it and the lightly char taste you get from wood burning ovens was nice. I typically don't like that taste. Though I enjoyed the crust and what not - there was like no cheese on the pizza so it was way too saucy and lack-lustrous. Not what I would have expected so I was quite disappointed",

It took me 15 minutes to flag down a different waiter as our waitress was MIA to get something different. By then everyone at my party was done eating so I skipped dinner. Good thing we got the nachos (which the chicken looked like frozen bits). I will never will eat here again.",

Lobster roll was good but not awesome like I remember. It was dry but I just asked for extra butter and lemon. The waitress however was rude and I'm hoping just having a bad day. She brought out wrong appetizer when I brought it to her attention she snapped \"that's what I wrote down\" I know I would never have ordered it. So I said it's ok just bring the correct one and she never did. I  always tip well cause I'm in the restaurant business myself and this is one of the few times I thought about not tipping at all. ( I gave her 15% not 20%) good polite service staff makes a big difference even when the food is off. But when you have bad service it's inexcusable.",

I ordered the lobster roll. The lobster was drenched in garlic butter and served on a very fresh, thick slice of Mancini's bread. The only complaint was that the lobster itself was a bit dry. If it had been more melt-in-your-mouth, fresh-textured, I'd be singing its praises to anyone who'd listen. Too bad, the other elements were great.   My mother said she'd had the lobster roll at Roland's a few years ago and she had the exact same experience.   So c'mon Roland's...you're in the Strip...figure out a way to make that lobster roll PERFECTION.",

    "text": "Once again, Yelp knows what it's talking about. I've lived in Pittsburgh for 8 years and I've always steered clear of Roland's. Something about it just screams \"mediocre, tourist, trap\", and this past week pretty much confirmed my assumption.   First impression was the service. My party of 3 sat at the bar, and it was immediately clear that the bartender was swamped. He was doing his best to keep up, but the only way to get any kind of attention was to flag him down as he sped past our section. We kept waiting for somebody to come help him, but that assistance never came. It was hard to watch, especially as a group sitting next to us became more and more infuriated with the unintentional neglect from the bartender.  Finally we got our food order in, and not too long after were presented with our first course. The calamari. It was below average. The pieces were way too big and over cooked. Next were spicy mussels with sausage. They were an improvement on the calamari although they were also a little over cooked. Most notable was the sheer quantity, you literally receive 2-3lbs of mussels, it was almost an obnoxiously huge amount of crustaceans. We went to town on them and still only put down half of the bucket. Lastly my Girlfriend and I split a Lobster roll with fries, which was very tasty. Once again, the lobster was a little over cooked, but overall it was a very basic, yet tasty sandwich. The fries on the other hand were unimpressive, hand cut, but soggy and lacking flavor.  Overall, it wasn't terribly disappointing, but Roland's could definitely use some work. How can you specialize in seafood and literally over cook all the seafood? And the fact that none of their management helped the bartender when he was getting his butt kicked was very disappointing to see.",

It took about 10 minutes for the hostess to come to the \"please wait to be seated\" sign to add our name to the list, with a line out the door also waiting to put their names in. The wait was an hour to get a table for 4 around 2-3:00 on a Saturday. It's so crowded there isn't even anywhere to stand. I was hoping it would be worth the wait, but it wasn't.  Once finally seated, it took forever to be greeted by our server, but he was very nice. Seemed like he was running around like a maniac and they were short staffed. It then took forever to get our drinks. When we finally got our food, we had no silverware or napkins. We asked our server for them, but after about 5 minutes of him not returning to the table, our food was getting cold. We flagged down another server and asked her, and she was SO rude. I understand she was not our server and was busy, but as a server of a restaurant, you shouldn't treat customers that way. When we finally got silverware, we were only given little drink napkins from the bar and our food was no longer hot.  Moving on to the food, terrible. I got the crab cake sandwich and it was very dry and tasteless. The crab cake itself was really small but on a huge roll. The sauce it was served with had a bad taste. My husband got the fish tacos and didn't like them. Our friend had the lobster roll, which was recommended by the server and it was so greasy and rubbery. The lobster was way overlooked. Our last friend got the Maryland crab soup and it tasted like a shaker of salt. Nobody liked or ate their meal.  I wanted to complain, but still felt bad for our server bc he seemed so busy, so we didnt want to bother him. I do not think I'll return to Roland's. So many better places in the strip district to eat with better, faster service and food. Roland's was really disappointing. The only thing I liked about Roland's was they serve full pint white lightening, which is sometimes hard to find at other restaurants in the area.",

The staff is always going above and beyond to satisfy any requests we had. I recommend the Hot Lobster Roll. It's not your traditional chilled lobster roll but it's even better than words can describe. Roland's is always a place we go to if we want seafood and there isn't a better place in the Burgh!",

I ordered the grilled chicken nachos while watching the game as the place was bustling with fun yinzers. I just wanted an App, not a whole meal. How could you screw up nachos after all?. For $11 they were pretty underwhelming. Very little dry queso cheese. Dry chicken pieces cubically cut. Not enough for the size of nachos plate. Nachos themselves were dry, salty and cold. Totally unmemorable. If an appetizer was below average not sure how entrees would be. I'll probably be back for drinks and overall atmosphere but would not go out of my way for the food. The patio seating looked nice.",

    "text": "My husband has enjoyed lunch at Roland's several times, so when he had a hankering for seafood, we headed down to dinner on a Saturday night. We were seated and given menus right away, which was a nice surprise since it was busy. But that's where the \"nice \" ended. It was ten minutes before a harried waiter came over, gave a us two napkin rolls and said \"I'll be right with you.\" Ten minutes more and he returned to take our drink orders. We could tell service was going to be slow, so we were prepared with our full order. We ordered water, two bottles of Newcastle Brown Ale, a half dozen raw oysters, salads and entrees. Ten more minutes go by and he brings the waters and tells us he'll be right back with the beer. So at this point we have been there 30 minutes and have water and silverware (I guess we should have counted ourselves lucky because we watched two tables receive food and NO silverware, and after asking for some and waiting, ended up going into the bar to get napkin rollups themselves from the bartender). At the 35 minute mark, our beers arrive -- two draft beers, not the bottles we ordered  When he delivers the beer, he says that our oysters are ready and he'll be right back. We take a sip of the draft beers, only to discover they were completely flat. We waited another 10 minutes with no sign of the waiter or the oysters, so I looked at my husband and said \"Let's vamoose!' and we got up and walked out.  It may be a great place for lunch (and I understand the food is good!) but we won't be going back for dinner.",

Nice atmosphere, ESPN on TVs, large selection of beer.  We immediately, almost before sitting down, were greeted by a waitress who made some recommendations.  As we had no idea whereto start we needed some time to evaluate, and she kept checking back, but without being pushy. The food was excellent!  Bruschetta and Seafood Pizza for me, Calamari and Seafood Stew for my colleague.  HUGE portions!  Great flavors, cooked right.  (I don't like calamari, but would have eaten more after trying this one.)",

There was a wait but they told us we could go upstairs to the patio which was first come first serve and the manager was setting us up a table and highchair.  No he didn't!  We pulled together our own tables and an hour into us arriving at the restaurant we had to go get our own highchair.    We ordered food and drinks right away.  While I was ordering I asked the waitress if I could have white sauce instead of a red sauce on the specialty pizza.  The waitresses response was \"No, I don't think that would be good.\"  Oh, I am so sorry that the paying customer asking for the meal thought it would be a good.    Out of the 6 of us, 5 people got pizzas and 1 person got a fish sandwich. The fish sandwich arrived nearly 20 minutes before the rest of our meals.  We never were offered refills on our drinks and silverware had to be requested multiple times.  The service was horrible, the atmosphere was chaotic and uncomfortable, and the food was just horrible.",

Their bartender was the absolute biggest jerk I've ever met in my entire life in any establishment I have ever been in any State I've ever traveled to.  The attitude of the entire staff is mildly one of, \"Please don't talk to me, you're just an inconvenience and I'm just trying to get thru my shift.\" However, this one bartender went out of his way to make me feel like my business was not only not appreciated, but that he wanted me to leave. What did I do? Nothing, I guess because I happen to have been by myself, I wasn't worth his time or bother to serve me a beer, so he simply ignored me, and then went out of his way to make me feel uncomfortable by switching channels of a football game I had come in to watch and giving me lame excuses as to why he couldn't put the game on even ONE tv set. He proved he not only was a jerk, but a liar on top of it. If you love being treated like garbage when spending your hard earned money, then this is the place for you, if on the other hand, you want to have a little service, and made to feel like your business is appreciated, then avoid this place like the plaque.",

After that we had the Cajun shrimp. It was decent but nothing special and only had 6 small shrimp. The mango salsa was nice but didn't add much to the dish.  I ordered the land and sea and got the beer battered shrimp. The shrimp for the entree was bigger than the appetizer and done well. My steak was cooked right and tasty.

    "text": "I ate dinner here with a group to celebrate a friend's birthday.  My overall opinion is that the service was terrible and the food was overpriced.    Our drinks took 15-20 minutes to arrive.  We were drinking beers, so I'm not sure why it took so long.  We had to wait an extremely long time for our food, I would estimate at least 45 minutes.  We had ordered calamari and bruschetta for appetizers, but they were served with the entrees.  When we started to eat it became very obvious that our food had been sitting for a while.  Anyone who had french fries said they were cold.  I ordered the rosemary shrimp scampi, which came with mashed potatoes and a broccoli/carrot mix.  The mashed potatoes were lukewarm at best, and the vegetables were cold.  I ate the broccoli, but I don't like raw carrots so I didn't eat those.  It honestly looked like they just threw a handful of baby carrots onto the plate.  As for the shrimp itself, it tasted good but wasn't what I expected.  I was expecting a pasta-type dish, but it was just 5 or 6 pieces of shrimp in a garlic butter bath.  And I don't think a few pieces of shrimp and cold vegetables should cost $23, especially when I was still hungry after the meal.  To top it all off, we realized halfway into our meals that we were never given napkins.  We had to ask twice for them to be brought out.  The only good thing about the experience was the beer selection.  If I ever come back here I will just stick to the bar and not waste my time or money on the food.",

    "text": "So after reading some of the other reviews,  I had some doubts about coming here,  however my wife insisted for her birthday,  so i agreed.    There were 10 of us and we went on Saturday at 5:30. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and were seated almost immediately!  Great start!   Our server was Matt K.,  and he was awesome!  Constantly checking on us and refilling drinks without us needing to ask.  Really impressed with the service!   We got the Oysters Rockafeller as an appetizer and they cane out sizzling and were very good!   Almost all of us got the Lobster Rolls.  Holy cow were they good!! Came out piping hot and the huge chunks of lobster was a delight to see and taste! The bread was also amazing,  nicely toasted and soft and oh so buttery and garlicy! Complimented the lobster very well!    We never felt rushed and it was very relaxing!    We called ahead of time and asked if we could bring a cake in (it was my wife's birthday)  and they said no problem!  When we were done with our meals,  Matt brought us out new plates, forks and spachela without us even needing to ask!  Again,  super impressed!   If I had any small complaint,  it was that the fries were only warm... But they were still good!    We will definitely go back!",

Unfortunately we love to sleep and showed up a little late and by the time we were ready to eat (around 4pm) our list of recommended places to try were already closed for the day.   Roland's was open though. As an added bonus they were showing the Steeler's game and there is nothing that Pittsburgh loves more than supporting the Steeler's and Penguin's. The atmosphere was great with everyone dressed in black and yellow and really into the game.  We ordered wedding soup (pretty delicious) and Portobello Mushroom Pizza. Maybe our mistake was not ordering seafood, anyway the caramelized onions on it were actually cooked in sugar (eww) and the sauce itself was just as sweet. It felt like we were eating candy.  As for the staff, Pittsburgh in general has some of the friendliest people I've come across in a long time. The staff here may not have been quite as friendly as we had come to expect from the rest of this lovely city but they were just fine.",

    "text": "Last weekend my mother and I headed down to the strip to get some weekly goods - lunch meat and cheese from Penn Mac - veggies at Stans - needed some new spices from Penzeys for a chili I was going to make that day....we were both a little hungry and knew we wanted to have a snack before shopping.  We parked in front of Roland's and see the sign: Famous for Lobster Rolls and Bloody Mary's!  Perfect.   My mother got the Lobster Roll, which she said was 'good'. The bread, from Mancini's, was of course tasty - toasted and buttery - delicious mostly because it was Mancini's bread. I had the Lobster Roll minus the carbs on a salad - and the lobster was tasty, no doubt , I mean, lobster is just - good. For the price though, not sure that I got enough bang for my buck. The salad was something I could have picked up at Get-Go in the pre-made section. I just didn't feel satisfied at the end of my meal. I couldn't even drink my Bloody Mary (this is a rare affair), way too much horseradish, and I often like horseradish in my Bloodies!  And it was cold - didn't even take my winter coat off. So, needless to say, not the best experience.  Talk about False advertisement...",

It was a premix tomato base that had so much pepper in it, it gave me a stomach ache.  Couldn't finish it because the bottom of the glass was nothing but pepper. When Matt the bartender, finally tore himself away from the 20 something girls at the other end of the bar, we asked if he could make another with less pepper. We were told  that he sells a buck fifty of these on a Saturday so, no he wasn't making it differently for us.  Wrong move and poor salesmanship.  Won't ever go back while he works there. I would have spent a boatload there between lunch n drinks, but another business in the strip got my business instead. ( to the tune of about $50.00)",

I didn't even touch the anemic, yellow and fishy smelling muscles - not that the waiter asked why we hadn't eaten them, more on this character in a moment. My ahi tuna steak was decent, but I think the scallops are what got me and my friend is sick as well. Just saying - check your food before the waiter walks off.  Speaking of the waiter - one of the worst I've ever had the displeasure of umm being served by? That sounds awkward and vaguely jack-assy ... Hmm the mild poisoning I have is affecting my wit, but you follow me.  This guy spilled half the water out of the oysters while trying to put a plate down, and didn't notice or say anything about it when he did; he asked me how I wanted my tuna steak prepared??!   Worst of all he spoke in this low monotone while other customers and cars going by drown him out so all you can tell is he asked you something because he's standing there with this kind of 'come on!' look on his face - totally rude and completely inept. I was hard put to give 10% tip to be honest.   I'd suggest the similar bar down the road for better quality food and service. Good luck out there!",

    "text": "So, four of us came in for the first time.  Diner 1 - ordered the lobster roll sandwich.  Lobster on a roll, nothing more...that's it.  Nothing special - have no idea why people would rave about this.  A bland, poor excuse of a sandwich that does a disservice to all northeasterners who know what a lobster roll is, and this ain't it.  Is this lobster?  Read on.  Diner 2 - ordered a large raw bar sampler, which was six Quahog clams, six oysters and six rubbery shrimp.  Who serves tough, chewy Quahogs on a raw bar?  This dive.  Also ordered the mussels, which were not seasoned and swimming in water.  No wine/garlic sauce as advertised on the menu - water.    Bland and awful.  Finished with the Mediterranean pizza which is spinach, feta and olives - the better part of the dinner.  Diner 3 - steamed clams.  Again who serves Quahogs for steamed clams?  These amateurs.  Also had the clam chowder - which appropriately had minced Quahogs in it.   Diner 4 - ordered the salad with the lobster roll, hold the bread.  Also asked for the lobster to be served chilled with it.  Lobster came hot and was dyed a deep red color.  Why the need to put lobster in a dye?   Because...it's not Maine lobster!  Imposter fish is dyed and artificially flavored, then frozen, then thawed, then microwaved at Roland's and called lobster.  That's my guess.  Sent the mussels back.  No offer to reduce the check or offer a comped dessert.     Rest rooms are dirty, and smell of urine.  Men's was an awful smelling pit and I was told that the ladies had one toilet drenched with urine on the seat, another blocked up and overflowing and a third that could be used.  This place is a smelly, dingy, dive bar with horrible food and poor service.  It is a trap for the unsuspecting tourist.   You have been warned...STAY AWAY!",

The place looks nice and is possibly the best location during the summer especially in the city.  I have always steered clear of Roland's because of an assumption.  But....the wife and her friend wanted a \"lobster roll\" so I was roped into going.  I opted to just drink a draught.  They got one of their famous lobster rolls and immediately were underwhelmed.  The sandwich was dwarfed by a mountain of handcut fries (the best part).  It also came with a limp pickle speer and a small condiment cup of coleslaw?!  The roll itself was lobster, but was fishy tasting and had no sauce?!  There was maybe 3ozs of fishy lobster on the roll.....Pathetic. Service was decent and my draught and few fries got this place the extra star it deserves.  Go to Wholey!!!!",

Well our oysters came out with our daughters pasta, which u would think how hard is it to make butter noodles with shrimp, we'll it must be hard bc her plate looked like cooked noodles with just shrimp on top, no butter. Then our sandwiches came out... they just sucked plain and simple.. not good at all, and don't get me started on the service, bc there wasn't any.. they had only 2 waiters for all the tables, and they had to bus their own tables, was a complete joke.. no organization at all. You could call me and say we can eat for free again, and I would definitely decline. We will not be back no way in hell. Ohh and 2 sandwiches with fries, kids pasta, and half dozen oysters came to 78 bucks complete rip off.",

We ordered the Lobster Nachos ($15), which were delivered to us piping hot and in less than 10 minutes. While it was a large serving of nachos for 2 people, the portion of lobster was paltry. They tasted fine but I would have expected more lobster for the price.   I wouldn't order food here, again.  Still, nice, fast service with a smile and a fun open space.

If that's not enough, there are wood fired pizzas pasta, and sandwiches. My favorite is their famous lobster roll.

Our attentive friendly cute inked up waiter was even sweet enough to give my gf that was losing her voice 2 cough drops which helped her voice so much. How sweet. I'm picky and WOW! Order accuracy was great too! Bald muscular inked up Bartender guy made a killer drink and was cute too. I swear a modeling agency has got to do their hiring. Every girl and guy there was so attractive, clean, friendly, sharply dressed, attentive, beautiful ink, all smiles, looked happy, knowledgeable...  You can tell they all really enjoy working there and have great chemistry with each other.  It's a well oiled machine.  I'll be back! Love this place!",

One of the reasons we visited Roland's was because it is dog friendly. My dog was welcome on the patio, where he sat and people-watched.   Our server was excellent; he was able to make recommendations and answer our questions. Plus, he kept my iced tea glass full. My sister and I shared the lobster nachos and even then we couldn't finish them. They were really good, with tons of lobster meat and delicious, gooey cheese. My s-i-l ordered the lobster roll, which was so very buttery and yummy, and the fries, which were fresh-cut but soggy. They were really the only negative, other than the smokers who congregated near the patio. There were so many items on the menu that I wanted to try, I can't wait to come back!",

I was hesitant in staying because we were pressed for time and I didnt see many waitresses.  We were greeted by Tonya our waitress not long after we sat down - and she didnt miss a beat.  Hot and humid... tables were soon full - and she was amazing. I was glad we came. .. cuz he kids loved it.  We didnt have to wait for anything. My nephew got the prosciutto wrapped shrimp and loved them. He is 11 and I have taught him about yelp and he said I should give the review 5 stars!!  Samantha my niece is who is a little older - loved her classic mussels.    I wasn't too hungry (humidity kills my appetite) and just ordered the the sweet chilli wings and they were ok - \"meh\".  They were not spicy at all and very mild- not as much flavor as I expected.  I am tough critic when it comes to wings.  Walking through the bar area to get to the ladies room after dining.. I was reminded about how much fun the upstairs area is at Rolands..   The restrooms on the second floor - have been totally revamped.. love the new look.   I am still and always will be a fan. Thanks Rolands. .. see you again real soon. mawh",

    "text": "Ugh Roland's, I wanted to like you but unfortunately you stayed True to your two star rating.   I'm not a Pittsburg native but came to visit for a weekend. We decided to visit the Strip district and wander around to find food. The first restaurant we tried to go to (Gaucho) had too long of a wait so we ended up at Roland's.   Things started off strong... but boy, did it go downhill pretty quickly. The place looked pretty packed, which I figured was a good sign. There is outside seating both upstairs and downstairs which seemed nice. We were helped right away. In fact, while the hostess cleaned off our table, 3 other employees approached us to ask if we were being seated. Those aspects made Roland's seem promising.  After we were seated, nobody came to greet us or take our order for about ten minutes. Ummmm what? Seemed strange after the staff was so attentive just moments before. We were finally able to flag down a waitress. Strike 1.   My group ordered a couple apps including the sweet chili shrimp and Cajun shrimp. The food came out in a timely manner. We still didn't have silverware or plates by the time the food came out. Strike 2.  The food itself was just meh. The sweet chili shrimp was good, better than the Cajun shrimp in my opinion. The Cajun strip was really basic. It didn't have much flavor to it. The mango salsa it came with was just ok (and trust me, that's tough for me to say since I'm such a lover of all things mango). I ordered the lobster mac and cheese from the appetizer section as my entree. Our entrees came our super quick... like before we could even finish our appys. This is a pet peeve of mine so I'll consider this strike 2.5.  The lobster mac and cheese was edible but not that impressive. There were large chunks of lobster in it which was good. But it was just so watery.... it almost tasted soupy?! It needed to be a lot thicker in consistency. Also, the presentation really had me baffled. It was served in a bowl which was on a plate. There were pieces of arugula shoved under the bowl. The pieces were haphazardly sticking out which made the meal look quite strange tbh. My group spent a couple minutes hypothesizing why this may be... the best reason we could come up with was to keep the bowl from sliding around the plate. Very weird. Strike 3.  You know what they say... three strikes and you're out. And Roland's is definitely out after my experience here. I'm sure there are much better options in the area, so I'd recommend eating elsewhere.",

First off the bar tender was rude, slow as hell and terrible at making drinks. My friend and myself order our food and 20 min later out comes my friends food. After almost an hour of waiting, I still had NO pizza. When I asked the cranky pants bar tender in the NICEST possible way, where it was, he just shrugged and walked away. I asked to speak to a manager and was told he was \"busy.\" Finally someone came to talk to me and after an hour and a half I got my shitty pizza.  Thank you to the kitchen manager for doing his job and coming to talk to the customer. But, to the bar tender working earlier New Year's Eve. You DO NOT DESERVE THIS JOB AND SHOULD BE FIRED.",

I don't think they raised their prices since the last time i was there, 2 or 3 years ago. The only reason i'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because their bathroom is filthy. Also their iron landing was closed. Food and service were supreme! Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Yuck!  It's almost embarrassing having this place exist in the Strip with so many tourists coming here.  That has to be how they're making their money because it's certainly not on their food or service.  Well, maybe it's the booze too...  I don't even know where to begin.  Service was horrible.  The lunch took 2 hours.  On a leisurely Sunday that may be fine, but there was no leisure.  At least not with drinks not in hand until a 1/2 an hour after we sat down.  I'd say lunch was served another 1/2 to 45 minutes later.    It didn't matter though, I knew it wasn't going to be anything spectacular.  I'd heard rumors about the food.  I won't go into any details but I wouldn't trust some items on the menu.  I just played it safe and ordered a veggie salad.    The salad was in the entree section, so I assumed it would be a full size salad.  It was not.  It was a side salad with a handful of grilled veggies on top.  Nothing spectacular.  And a side salad at almost $11.  Not worth it.    If you are forced to stop in because you're dying of hunger, stick to a liquid diet:)",

Here's the big clue I keep ignoring....the restaurant is EMPTY when everywhere else is crowded. Another issue is there's poor A/C in the dining room, which kind of sucks when it's 85 degrees and humid outside.   I had a grilled vegetable sandwich and clam chowder. Same as before, it was just OK.  Service was better this time though.   All in all, I preferred my to go taco salad from doba the night before to this meal.

If you are going in for a few drinks, this may be a fine spot to stop into while you are in the Strip but for anything more, my advice would be to head elsewhere as there are plenty of better options.   I have been in here on a few occasions for dining while we were meandering around the Strip (as I was giving it more than 1-2 chances) and each time my disappointment with the place grew.  I did not think it would get worse after my first trip there in years.    Some items on the menu that were terrible were the calamari, the zucchini and the artichoke and spin dip... how do you mess these up?  The Lobster ravioli was not so good either.  If you want a better experience in the Strip, go to Kaya, Little Bangkok or Eleven... do not waste your money here as you are not going to be getting what you paid for and will leave very unsatisfied.",

This restaurant though, is THE spot to watch any and all PGH sporting events. I love coming here on Steeler Sunday's to watch the games. ESPECIALLY for home games, talk about a fun place to be!  The food is awesome, hands down some of the best around. I really love the calamari, and always recommend it. The beer is cold, and there is a huge menu selection.

This is definitely a local go-to for seafood lovers. I was not impressed with the lobster roll, I typically don't like the lobster fried. I would say it doesn't have the same style of cooking as a maine lobster roll if that is what you are looking for.

After four days in this town of eating and drinking I wasn't looking for a LOT of food, just something to hold me over until we got back to Jersey.   We waited for about 60 seconds for a table to be cleaned up and were seated in a booth. No more drinking for us we we just got iced teas and water, but this place does have a pretty extensive list of beers on tap and by the bottle/can.   Wifey decided on the Fish tacos, my son had the Margherita wood fired pizza (personal size) and I had the Beer battered fish sandwich. I wanted the lobster roll but thought it would be too rich after the past four days.  My son hammered the pizza...absolutely loved it (he's not as much of a pizza snob as I am, but I can't comment since he wouldn't give me a taste). Wifey really liked her tacos...two giant fried fish tacos that she just ate the insides out of the second one. My fish sandwich was probably the best fish sandwich I ever had and it was huge. Easily enough for two sandwiches. My brief conversation with the waitress:  Me: \"That was the best fish sandwich I've ever eaten in my life. \"  Waitress Christy: \"Awww, well I'm happy for you hon\" (translated-that's nice sweetie...now get out so I can make more tips.  But seriously in a nice way. )  The one very disappointing item was the fries. They LOOKED well done, but they weren't. They were kind of a soggy mess. Anyway, very good entrees, huge portions, fun service...I would eat here again.",

The waitress told me it was the same amount of lobster as is in the single roll, and it was less money so that is what I went with.  I started off with a bowl of the clam chowder, recommended by our waitress. It arrived in a huge bowl! I would have been totally satisfied with just that for my lunch. Very good, and for $5 a great price too. My husband went with the Proscuitto and Arugula pizza. Loved it, finished off the whole pie! My sliders were less exciting. The rolls were just too much. Since they were mini rolls they were kind of dry and I should have just gone with the regular sized roll. The lobster filling was great, so I finished all of that and left most of the bread. Overall the meal was pretty good. Probably not great enough to warrant a second visit, but definitely try the chowder.",

Roland's wasn't the original plan, but when things fell through, we were quick to decide on Roland's as there is a nice outdoor seating area. Sitting outside, we figured we could enjoy some of the last of our summer evenings before fall comes. I don't even want to think about that yet!  My friend and her fiance came to meet my boyfriend and I in the strip for a little double date and to grab a bite to eat. We were seated immediately outside and our waiter brought us some lemon water. My boyfriend ordered a beer, and we took a moment to glance over the menu as we were both newcomers here. My friend and her boyfriend actually went on one of their very first dates here years ago. They were quick to decide on the lobster bisque to share, and the seafood pizza with shrimp, scallops, lobster, and whatever else the ocean has to offer. My boyfriend opted for the fried fish sandwich and I got the sweet chili shrimp from the appetizer menu. It was a hard choice, though, because I love some good seafood!  First, the waiter brought their soup. We waited for our food while they ate, and they brought out both of our orders and the pizza right around the same time so we could all eat together. My favorite thing about the sweet chili shrimp (aside from the sauce, one of my favorites) was that it was battered with cornmeal rather than a traditional batter. My boyfriend's fish sandwich was seriously massive and he ate every bite of it. He's allergic to shrimp, so although the seafood pizza looked incredible, we'd have to make another choice from the menu if we were to go for a pizza. The menu had a lobster artichoke pizza that sounded amazing, and that's what I'll have my sights set on for next time.   During our visit there was nothing wrong at all with our service or our food. Everything was delicious and our waiter was quick to accommodate us and he was friendly. There was a small mistake with our checks because he put my boyfriend's beer on the wrong check, but he was fast when fixing it. All in all for around $30, Roland's was a great choice.",

A waitress walked by and there was bartender insight but no one greeted or spoke to us or the other customers waiting to be seated. After we were seated the server was very nice and service was fast. The shrimp and cocktail sauce were great. The disappointment was the clams which were sandy and tasted like the clams were not cleaned properly. We ordered the oysters cooked and they were fine. The lobster rolls were fine but on the dry side. Crab stuffed mushrooms had a strange taste. The calamari was over cooked and pieces were stuck together in a lump. Since the server never asked how the food was... I can only assume that they get a lot of complaints.",

We had a party of about 12 so we figured it would be even longer than that. We chose Roland's strictly because it didn't have a wait and they could get a table together for us in 5 minutes. We had a GREAT MEAL. Almost everyone got salads to start and my Caesar salad was HUGE. I had to stop eating it because I knew a meal was coming. I got the lobster bisque which was pretty good. I also shared the lobster nachos with my boyfriend. THIS was the kicker. I could eat these things every single day. They were loaded with huge lumps of lobster, a lot of it from the claw, and the best white queso. I would come back specially for this. It was so good that I would've never ordered the salad or soup and just ordered 2 plates of nachos if I had known. We are DEFINITELY coming back!",

I ordered the fish tacos, which came as a pair and I was surprised by the hefty amount of broiled white fish on each one. Sadly, that's all the tacos really were...two big tortillas + fish. They lacked flavor, spice, salsa or something (anything) more inviting than a few green lettuce leaves shoved underneath the big hunk of fish. I also opted to go with a side salad instead of the standard fries. This was a $3 upcharge - a substitution cost is pretty normal - but all I got was a wilty pile of mostly iceberg lettuce, some shredded carrots, two cherry tomatoes, and a couple of olives. When I was done, I had a little napkin full of slimy lettuce I had to set aside and not eat.  My husband ordered a grilled chicken sandwich. He said he liked it and...he also likes just about anything. :) The fries that came with his sandwich seemed like they had the potential to be good, if they were actually served hot.   As far as service goes, it was sufficient. Nothing to write home about. I noticed that tables surrounding us were left filled with plates, dirty napkins, etc. for far too long after other diners had left. Particularly for a table right next to ours, the food did not get cleaned off during the entire time we were there, which was about an hour!",

However, when it comes to \"real\" food, I suggest to stay away. I was especially disappointed with the bar staff.

I was apprehensive bc of it's 2.5 star Yelp rating, but didn't get a chance to read the reviews beforehand (I've since read a few of the bad ones). That said, I was very pleasantly surprised with my meal because I wasn't expecting much. I ordered the Cajun shrimp appetizer and this is the only reason I'm giving 4 stars. The shrimp were very spicy but not flavorful. I like spicy food but not when it's just hot for no reason without flavor. The mango salsa it came with made it bearable. Now let's get down the business, my main meal was the Roland's Seafood stew which was DELICIOUS! The stew is a light cream based broth with lobster, shrimp, scallops, mussels, clams and potatoes. If licking the bowl in public were appropriate, I would've. More fun facts, the food came out relatively fast and our waiter was super friendly and quick - she was literally hustling back and forth. I'll bookmark this spot for the next time I visit.",

They brought one of my daughters meals after about 20 minutes while my other daughter had to sit there and watch her eat while she was hungry. We ended up having to take the food to go after an hour given how long it took. Spoke with the manager who had minimal compassion for the experience and worst of all this occurred on Mothers Day. By far the worst experience at a restaurant that I ever have. Do yourself a favor and go ANYWHERE else.",

However, each time I have gone to Roland's I have been extremely disappointed in the service; Hosts were focused more on talking to each other, rather than helping customers. The servers seem lost, perhaps I've just gotten new staff members each time, but I personally think they need more training. The bartenders, however, were a lot better, they knew the menu, valued cleanliness, and maintained a positive relationship with patrons. With all that said, the real shoutout needs to go to kitchen staff, despite underwhelming customer service, the food is what always brings me back!  I recommend the lobster nachos, stuffed mushrooms, or mussels! So yummy!",

We got our appetizer, salads, and entrees at the same time and everything was cold. I don't know how you can manage to overcook food and then it's still cold, but that's what happened. The mussels were barely seasoned and were hardly edible.   I never complain at restaurants, but our meals were so bad that we had to complain to the manager. Luckily, he appologized and took one of the entrees off. I can't believe how bad the food was and that they're charging so much for it. It was awful.",

    "text": "Dateline: Late yesterday afternoon.  Kay's friend Nadine said she wanted pho. Then she said she didn't and didn't really care where we went.   I wanted to try the new Argentinian restaurant across from Altar Bar, but we found out the hard way that they're closed on Mondays. Neither Kay nor Nadine felt like walking up Smallman Street for anything. Kay despises Primanti Brothers.   Nadine spots Roland's Seafood Grill. My heart falls into my intestines.   \"Oh, I like Roland's,\" she utters innocently. \"Let's go there.\"   \"Maybe we could go to Harp and Fiddle,\" I suggest.   Kay whispers to me through her clenched teeth, \"No. Yelp...ing to...night. And no...more...walking. You...don't need to only go to places you haven't reviewed yet.\"  So, yeah. We went back to Roland's.   And like my last experience, it wasn't half-atrocious.   The fried calamari is actually well-battered and quite plump and tasty aside from the inexplicable inclusion of lifeless sauteed onions.   And that lobster roll of theirs, the one Roland's is supposedly famed for, contains within a tough, toasted Fenway Park-styled bun some fat chunks of choice, succulent crustacean meat. The sandwich came with a small cup of middling cole slaw and a pile of limp, dark, blanched steak fries as if to remind me of where I was really having dinner, and it wasn't some oceanside shack in Maine.   Nadine's Basil and Pesto Pizza was also an unlikely winner with its luscious artichoke pieces almost thieving thunder from the blackened, wood-fired crust, dreamy cheese, and caramelized red peppers. The sauce was but an afterthought.   Our server, Ahsan (?), was competent and friendly.   If you stick with pizza or sandwiches, you should have a tolerable time at Roland's. Therefore, consider this 3 a higher 3 than before. I'd give them a 4, but to be truthful, I'm not dying to return due to the paucity of their card. There's just too much good, good food goin' on in this neighborhood.   Try not to use the bathrooms, either. The men's restroom reeked of urine and was very unkempt overall.",

We mentioned to the server we were not from here and unsure what we wanted and he offered no help, just walked away but kept coming back to the table every few minutes saying, \"so, what can i get you?\". We decided on things and order. Worst service i've had in a long time, rude and he didn't really care to help us at all. We ended up getting the lobster ravioli and a wood fired pizza and both were average at best. For a $30 meal each, not great. Really the service is what did it for me. I will remember to never return while i'm in pittsburgh.   Another thing was that we were sitting in basically a sports bar spending$30 on ravioli. Horrible atmosphere for the food on the menu in parts.",

    "text": "I've been here before but last night will probably be the last time I ever have any type of desire to eat their food. My boyfriend and I were meeting my parents for dinner and everywhere we tried was booked for reservation only on Pitts graduation weekend. We ended up and Roland's and were seated within 5 minutes.  Our waitress was a combination of ditzy, snobby and bored. She was awkward and uncomfortable every time she came to the table. She is not a good candidate to be in the service industry, in my opinion.   We ordered the lobster roll sliders to start. There were 4 of us and they brought out three. No big deal- mom and I will split one....but the waitress only brought three plates. I ordered the Maryland crab soup (specified first) and hot lobster Caesar salad. My salad came out shortly after the appetizer sliders. I sat for 15 minutes without touching the salad as to wait for the rest of everyone to get their food. Finally it was delivered. My dad and boyfriend had the seafood stew which they said was good and my mom had the pasta di mare (she said it was just ok. Lacking flavor) and a salad (which she was never given and didn't realize until after we left).  No soup for me apparently. I requested the waitress please bring it out. She was unapologetic.   When I finally got to dive into my hot lobster (now cold lobster) caesar, I realized it was just lettuce, a little cheese and the lobster. At this point I was so irritated with everything I didn't even care - nor was I surprised at the quality of my dish given everything leading up to it.  The lobster was good and there was a good bit of it plus the Caesar dressing which I always like. The Maryland crab soup tasted like chunky tomato marinara sauce and I gave it to my boyfriend to go home and use on his own homemade seafood pasta dish. My mom was disgusted by the clams in her dish and it was suggested that they were probably frozen.   Do yourself a favor and go down the street to luke wholeys Alaskan grill where you get much better quality seafood for the same price. After I had been there; I feel totally ripped off by Roland's. No bueno.",

All of us got violently ill despite eating different things.  The bathrooms were atrocious. There was toilet paper everywhere. There were some bugs in the ladies room.  This was mid-day and NOT the southside so I found it a bit surprising.  The last few times I've eaten here have been in the last 2 years and everytime I find the food and environment to be mediocre.  It's never horrible. Hasn't made me sick, again.  It's just sub par.  My s.o. likes the lobster roll here and says it's great.  I don't eat seafood often so I wouldn't know. I've had the white pizza with basil and it was pretty good.  Good cheese to crust ratio for sure. I wouldn't say not to go here, but if you're looking to get something delicious and exciting I'd suggest finding something else in the strip.",

The calamari was actually really nice, light and not super greasy, but the Cajun shrimp were tiny and underwhelming. With six very small pieces bathing in oil and a side of flavorless mango salsa, I would not recommend this appetizer at all. I got the shrimp scampi entree, which comes with the vegetable of the day, salad and potatoes. The potatoes and salad were good, but the corn was very small and brown. It looked like it went bad and they cooked it anyway. Then I tasted it and knew it went bad and they cooked it anyway. That, for me, ruined my whole meal. No amount of butter and salt could save that corn. My bf got the steak with battered shrimp. He enjoyed his meal but didn't want the potatoes and corn. They wouldn't substitute with anything except salad so basically it was $30 for a piece of steak and a few pieces of shrimp. For seafood, in general, the prices were not bad, but I rather pay more and have a better quality meal.",

We waited a very long time for cocktails and order to be taken, when there was little crowd around in the restaurant. Then, our oyster order came out on a plate of water, not ice. They were small and shriveled up and warm. Next, the mussels in white wine sauce....hahahah. Um, no...it was more like garbage sewer sauce. Mussels were freezing COLD. Had to search for a server to get the check, took a long time again. Normally, I would complain right then and there for such terrible food and service but it was one of those days that was going so nicely that complaining about food would just ruin mine and my husband's infrequent night out without kids. I did feel strongly enough to write this review. How can a seafood place serve terrible seafood? I have never given a 0 star review and have worked in the food service industry. This place is terrible. Spend your money somewhere else.",

Not sure if this is normal, but I thought it was weird for a sports bar type restaurant . Although $.60 oysters was nice during happy hour.",

Sandwiches... 2 lobster rolls and 1 fish sandwich.....Both very good, although the fish was slightly overcooked. Again...huge portions.   CONS...After being at table since 5:30, nothing but our empty pop glasses were in front if us. After being told said clam chowder was being freshly cooked, 15 minutes later it was served. As good as it was, it certainly wasn't hot enough to claim it just came out if the pot. Our sandwiches finally came out after other tables around who had ordered well after us received our orders. They may also want to schedule a couple more servers on a Saturday night. The best though was the incompetent hostess. The hostess with the leastest. Talk about someone who didn't have a clue. From screwing up where we were supposed to sit, to watching her continue to do the same thing with others, at least it gave us something to talk about while we waited. What a twit.",

Apparently for the two of them, Rolands is a good example of this. I have yet to experience \"trash\" Yinser locales, so my frame of reference is still incomplete.  Roland's is low-key and not pretentious. You can show up in cargo shorts and a sports team tshirt at any point in the day and fit in well. The food is average at best, but when you're hungry and don't want to wait in line at Gaucho for 2 hours, this place is a great option. The service staff are nice and attentive, the drinks are strong and cheap, and if you are with good company, Roland's is a lot of fun. Good ambience, nice background music, multiple TVs set to different sports channels. The interior decor is fun in a cheesy way.  It's worth checking out periodically. It's a nice reminder that not every place has to be hip, fresh, contemporary, and overpriced to be worth a visit.",

The food was \"meh\". The clam chowder was just ok. I was excited for the lobster/artichoke pizza, but it was absolutely tasteless! Like, I was shocked by how much it tasted like nothing. I ended up slathering my clam chowder all over the pizza in an attempt to kick up the flavor. The pizza crust was good -thin and chewy just like I prefer. We also ordered the lobster roll sliders and the best thing about that dish was the Mancini bread.  Not worth the bucks.   The service was slow-mo, but as I mentioned it was a crowded Friday night so it didn't bother me much.   There were a few good beer selections on draft...so that's a plus. But I definitely won't return. Life is too short for less than mediocre food.",

My business partner and I went to Pittsburgh for business and weren't picky about our food but rats is on a whole new level. We didn't see this rat until the end of the meal. Before I saw the rat, I told my business partner that my pasta was the worst plate of pasta I've ever had in my life but ate it anyway because I was so hungry. I regret eating it...  Towards the end of the meal, the rat ran past our table and lingered around the booth areas for awhile and didn't even look scared. It was DISGUSTING.   We told the server who went to get the manager. 5 minutes later, he came out and said \"oh well you know we leave the door open sometimes and they just come in.\" What does that even mean?? He was rude, unapologetic, and nonchalant which made us think this is a common thing for them at the restaurant!  He didn't offer to waive the bill or do anything about it and we stood there in shock and paid $55 for the two of us for a disgusting meal, bad service from the manager, and a RAT running around our table.

    "text": "Stopped in last night because we wanted to 'step out' of our usual places on Carson St.  The place was rather busy and was pleasantly warm on a cold Saturday night.  We found seats at the bar and a friendly bartender greeted us and took our drink order.  The drafts arrived right away and we requested menu's...    We ordered 2 shrimp cocktails and a calamari.  The shrimp arrived within 5 minutes and came with a small bowl of cocktail sauce with a dollop of horseradish on top.  I mixed mine as I love horseradish but my friend would have preferred it on the side or in another bowl as he isn't a fan.  The shrimp were big and fresh and delicious.  I mean- can you really mess up cold shrimp...?  The calamari took over a half hour to arrive.  It was pleasing to the eye and smelled delicious.  It had grilled onions & peppers on it with a slight spice dusted on top.  I thought it was delicious but my wife wasn't digging it.  She thought it was overcooked & rubbery.  Our friend isn't a fan of calamari so we didn't have a 3rd opinion to be the deciding factor...  Then things went south... My wife went into the ladies room and came out with a straight up disgusted look on her face.  I saw her stop a waitress and after the 'chat' the waitress turned away and rolled her eyes.  Well, my wife said the bathroom was disgusting- Toilet paper & paper towels all over the floor, 5 stalls with only a half roll of toilet paper to be shared between all 5, no paper towels to dry your hands off after you washed them.  Does the employees have a separate washroom to use or do they use this one also and just don't notice???  The health dept signs say \"Employees must wash & dry hands with soap & hot water\".  Then I visited the Men's room and found almost the same thing- paper all over the floor in the stalls, I didn't notice if they had tp in there, and no paper towels to dry your hands with.    To us- the bathrooms must be clean & well stocked or we wonder what the kitchen & other 'back of house' areas look like.  If the bathrooms are in this much need of attention- the kitchen must be worse...    We paid our tab and left...",

    "text": "We took my dad to dinner here for his birthday. There were only 6 of us, and it was a Sunday evening - not too busy, but they seemed to be understaffed. We were able to be seated immediately, which was nice. All of the staff was very friendly. Those are about the only positive things I can say about our experience.   We all ordered appetizers. When the waitress brought them out she admitted that she had forgotten to put my dads order of stuffed mushrooms in. Actually, she didn't even remember what he had ordered so we had to tell her again.   My appetizer was Cajun shrimp, which was WAY over seasoned. I couldn't even see the shrimp underneath the thick crust of Cajun seasoning. It was at least 1/4\" thick, and had to be scraped off. But there was so much that I couldn't even taste the shrimp at that point, only crusty dry chunks of seasoning.   My sister ordered oysters. She said they were not shucked/cleaned correctly, so there was grit in her oysters.   My dads stuffed mushrooms finally arrived well after salads. They didn't discount them or take them off the bill or anything, which I find annoying since the waitress admitted she completely forgot them and they arrived about 30 minutes after they were ordered.   As for our meals, it was a series of mediocrity and mistakes. My steak, which was ordered medium, was served well, as was my fathers. I chose to send mine back, which meant I got my steak after everyone had already finished their meals. My lobster tail was chewy and the \"stuffing\" in it was not very good. My father said his scampi was \"okay\".  My sister ordered the Pasta Di Mare - which she said was basically pasta covered in olive oil, which was largely bland and unseasoned, instead of a wine sauce.   My other sister had the crab cakes, which she said were bland and dry.  My brother in law had the lobster roll, which seemed to be the winner of the night. He said it was decent. Not great, but decent.   My sisters fiance ordered the seafood stew and he described the sauce as \"milk, with old bay seasoning in it.\" He said it was \"gross\".   The mashed potatoes were great, everyone agreed on that.   I did see my sister pull a hair out of her salad dressing.   I also had a big ol fly land, twitching, right by my plate as I was moving my steak. I could have sworn it popped out from under the wilted piece of lettuce that my steak was served on...but my sister said she didn't think so. She killed it with a napkin since it seemed it was in the throes of death already.   The bathrooms were disgusting.   This is probably the worst review of a restaurant I've ever written. I feel bad because our waitress was really nice... But this place was just awful. I probably should give it one star, but I felt like the waitress was really trying her hardest to give us a good experience. I feel worse because now we need to take my dad out to another dinner to make up for this - he is not a complainer but I could tell he was disappointed.   We will not go back and will not recommend Roland's.",

The Maryland crab soup was truly delicious!  The Garlic Parmesan wings were good but dry and needed more of both seasonings.  A friend got the Ahi Tuna which was overlooked and dry. I got the salmon which was good. Both came with delicious mashed potatoes.  The Caesar Salad was quite delicious. And the Sicilian Pizza was good but the chorizo chunks overpowered the pizza.  Another friend got the seafood stew which he loved.  The decaf coffee was excellent, a happy surprise!  All in all the meal hit some high notes and some middle notes.",

When I made her aware of it, she didn't apologize, but got me a dry rag and when I asked where the restroom was, she said, \"You'll have to go upstairs, the one down here is out of order\".  While I was cleaning myself in the restroom, she asked my boyfriend if she'd done that and when he said \"yes\", she gave him dirty looks the remainder of the time, but said she'd deduct 2 lemonades off the bill (big whoop).  It wasn't until it was tip-leaving time that she finally apologized.  If it weren't for the fact that the food was good, I'd give it one-star.",

My friend ordered the pasta di mare with white sauce. It was very bland, lacked flavor and sauce. Overall, we were very disappointed with our meal and wasted $60 on subpar food.

However, for the quality of seafood you're getting, I think the pricing is just too high. Especially when you're paying for mostly grease. The portions look huge but you're paying for mostly fries.",

Their fried food is just your normal find but they do sushi, great steamed mussels and my favorite, their Caesar salad.  They add lemons with it, which I had never seen. Make sure you try it out and be sure to squeeze that lemon on your Caesar salad...it really makes the salad pop.   This place is good for all ages, food, decor and clientele.

    "text": "A group of three of us went to Roland's on a busy Sunday afternoon.   Being pretty new to the Pittsburgh area and having never been to the Strip District we walked along the packed street until we happened along Roland's. It had a good amount of people dining and people were in and out constantly as we discussed if we should venture the unknown. With what we saw in mind, we figured it must be ok.  We waited 30 minutes at the packed bar for our table. Once seated we were greeted by our very nice server Brittney who advised us of the specials and their specialities. One person in our party inquired about the \"famous\" lobster roll. We were advised they use real lobster and that it's loaded with big pieces of lobster meat. Considering two of the people in our party we're visiting from south Florida (a seafood rich environment), the seafood knowledge is vast. We ordered a bowl of clam chowder to share, a lobster roll, margarita pizza and some other entree that escapes me. Our drinks and the bowl of soup arrived within a reasonable amount of time but the entrees didn't arrive for 30 minutes from the time our soup came. To make matters worse the lobster roll and forgotten entree came out at that 30 minute mark but the margarita pizza didn't arrive to our table for another 20 minutes. Now, the food. Not being a huge clam chowder fan, I was very pleasantly surprised and we all thoroughly enjoy the chowder. The lobster roll is not \"loaded with big pieces of lobster meat\", it is a sandwich made with langostinos (not a lobster, not a prawn more like a crayfish or per Wikipedia - a relative to the hermit crab?!?!). The margarita pizza was ordinary, average and utterly forgettable. I ate a piece and a half and took home the rest. Unfortunately no one was interested in partaking in it after the fact so it was pitched. The unknown entree must have been ok because I do recall the plate being empty but again, I don't recall what is was. Following our food, we had a difficult time getting our check and had to hunt down a server on our way to the restroom. Which speaking of, there were three stalls if I recall and two of them were stopped up with, well, you know and the third had no toilet paper. My waiting friend kept telling everyone who lined up behind us to grab paper towels so they weren't paperless once they finally got in there. Advising the hostess staff feel on deaf ears because they both seemed to care less and gave my friend and unspoken \"whatever\" face and response. I do not believe I will be giving Roland's a second chance nor recommending it to visitors.",

    "text": "Spending a beautiful day in the strip a few weeks ago culminated in a (what I'd hoped) was a quick stop at Roland's. Grab a beer, lobster roll and salad, and I'd be home before traffic. I was not so lucky.  I arrived and was immediately sat by a waitress that appeared to be extremely overwhelmed by the five tables in the patio. There were a few guests at the bar, being entertained by the bartender. I should have gone and sat there, but it was so nice out, I decided to eat on the patio.  My beer order was taken quickly, but then took twelve minutes to arrive. By that time, the head was gone, and it was losing it's cool. The waitress abruptly dropped off the beer and disappeared. I already knew what I was ordering, but she flitted around from table to table awkwardly for a good ten minutes until I made creepy eye contact with her and she shuffled my way. She took my order, and pretended to care about what I was ordering, but then disappeared again.  Forty minutes later my poor lobster roll arrived. The fries were mushy, and the lobster roll took six (SIX!) napkins to sop up all the grease. I ate it, but I wasn't happy. About three bites in (and with the fastest response time of my dining experience) here comes awkward waitress again, asking if I needed anything else. I decided on another beer. She then proceeded to ask me if I minded if she smoked a cigarette before she grabbed my beer. (WHAT?!) No. Forget the beer. Bring me my check.   With no tip for awkward waitress, I left. Probably never to return.  Happy Eating, just not here.",

It had about 4 tiny pieces of shrimp on it, with a ton of  breading to make them appear larger. It was served on a huge roll, which was about 6 times the size of the sad little shrimp. Also, the shrimp had no seasoning or taste. This entire sandwhich was basically BREAD, for $15!! The service was not good either. I told my waitress I was not happy with the sandwhich and she asked \"would you like me to go tell a manager?\" as far as I am concerned, a good waitress would just go tell her manager, not ask me if she should. It was obvious that she didn't care, and did nothing to fix the situation. I guess she is used to complaints. I will not eat here again.",

My favorite item is the Mussels. Priced a few dollars more than most places but you get twice as much as any place. A heaping pot full. There a 4 or 5 variations to choose from.

Slow (pitiful) service, nasty food ( and we each sprung for the lobster roll -- if you can call it that!) and a generally miserable experience. And this was an early lunch with very few customers around. The only thing remotely redeemable was that we sat on the balcony overlooking Penn avenue and were entertained by the people below. People watching can be a blast.   I wanted a draft beer and was told that \"we don't serve draft beer upstairs\". What??? There's a bar there!! Are you kidding me?? So water it was and that took a long time to arrive. And without straws - another wait after I had the audacity to ask for them.  The \"lobster rolls\" arrived and looked mighty meager. That's not a lobster roll!! But I pressed on. As I got it closer to my mouth there was a slight aroma. But press on. The \"lobster\" was sparse, tough, and flavorless. How often could you say that about lobster??? Exactly!! It must have been harvested years ago and waited for me to show up so it could make its way out of the freezer. At $15 each this falls clearly into the ripoff category.  And trying to get our check? Ridiculous.   I won't be back. Ever.",

The 4-6pm happy hour oysters, clams and shrimp are so ridiculously underpriced - 60 cents!!! I only order the oysters as they've been top notch, shucked well. For all the peeps complaining about lobster roll - smart people order lobster roll in Maine. The seafood stew overflows with sea scallops, shrimp, clams, mussels and lobster. At 21.99, it's best value. Also filled with roasted potatoes and a roux that's the right level of spice. It's a feast!  I'm a business traveler and John is now a friend. 'Nuff said!  Update: the stuffed shrimp are also very good.",

After being seated, it took nearly 10 minutes for a server to greet us and take a drink order.  I was of course rewarded with the wrong beer.  Then we order and when the food arrived, the fries were cold and the fish sandwich was rather greasy.  I wake up today only to be 'sick' from the whole ordeal.  My mother, who had the same food as I did, is feeling the same as me.  Get your act together Rolands, you are better than this.",

The clams i got steamed and they were a little over done, and the oysters were left attached to the shell. But for 60 cents, I can deal with taking them Off myself. As far as service? We sat at the bar, he wasn't very friendly or rude, just meh. But the food came out in a timely manner.",

She brought our soups, which luckily had spoons in the huge bowls. All were absolutely delicious. The lobster bisque actually had lots of pieces of lobster and the onion soup rich, beefy taste with lots of onions. The clam chowder had tons of clams and the portion was large enough for a meal!!! Our shrimp appetizers ...fried shrimp and shrimp cooked in a beer broth were excellent. Unfortunately our server had no clue how to actually serve people in a restaurant...we had to ask 3 times for napkins and when they were finally brought to the table, she acted as if she was doing us a Big Favor. Then after our food was brought to the table and we asked multiple times for eating utensils. The first time we asked her we were polite, then asked another server, then when we asked at the hostess stand we were told \"oh we told your waitress to bring them\". When she finally brought them to our table she said \"if you had asked nicely I would have brought them sooner\". Can you believe that!!! The floor manager came over and while he apologized, also made excuses for her confrontational behavior.  5 stars for food and food prep, 0 stars for rude service or lack of service.",

There was a breakfast place and Primanti brothers that was packed. So we were dying for some food and ran across Roland's. We got mussels and banana peppers stuffed with sausage for our appetizers. I also got a lobster roll. They gave us a lot of mussels slathered with garlic and butter. Surprisingly good. And the banana peppers were not bad too. I also enjoyed my lobster roll. Buttered toast and big chunks of lobster meat. I had no room left to finish off my fries.   Now, I can't decide if the food was average or below average as we were pretty hungry. I'll give Roland's the benefit of the doubt. Don't expect anything spectacular, just food that fills your belly.",

I had been to Roland's once about two years ago and remembered loving their food. I now know why there were so many bad reviews. I was really disappointed and had a really terrible birthday dinner. The only reason I gave this restaurant two stars is because our waiter was fantastic and was so attentive. I am a waitress myself so I appreciate good service so much. Anyway, I got crab stuffed shrimp with broccoli. The shrimp were so small that they should never be stuffed with anything. And the amount of stuffing was a joke because of it. My broccoli was basically raw. My boyfriend got Ahi Tuna which he normally loves. His tuna was so rubbery. It was horrible. His broccoli was also raw. I never complain at restaurants but I told him he could send his tuna back if he wanted to, but he didn't \"want to be a jerk\". The other couples food wasn't as bad as ours but it wasn't anything great either. I get some restaurants don't have great food, but the worst part is Roland's menu is fairly pricey. I believe my dinner and my boyfriend's dinner were around $25 each. They need to lower their prices significantly to reflect their food or do some work to improve their food. I will never go back to Roland's.",

We ordered our food very fast. He didn't ask how we wanted our meat cooked or anything . I got Ahi Tuna. On the menu it says it comes with a salad, a vegetable, and choice of mashed potatoes or French fries. 20 minutes later our food came out, and it was a huge disappointment. The food was awful, overcooked, and lacked any sort of good flavor. My father's lobster role was shredded pieces of lobster , overdressed, and stuffed into a bun. My sisters filet mignon was cooked to death, and the worst part was mine. The tuna steak tasted like canned tuna. It was strong, and severely overcooked. There was no sign of pink anywhere through the tuna. We will not come back, and anyone thinking about going here, don't! There are much better places to eat in the city of Pittsburgh.",

But the Clams Casino were inedible. The clams were served raw with a burnt bread crumb topping. The crab cakes were also bad. Both went back.  The waitress never asked if we wanted something else or if the rest of the meals were fine.  The New England Clam Chowder was good but overpowered by the smoky bacon that was added to the soup.

    "text": "I went here on a Friday afternoon for lunch with some coworkers. We were a party of 12. Even though the restaurant was busy, they were able to get us a table. Apparently there is a second floor room that can be rented out for parties, but they don't take reservations.   The interior of the building is nicer than I thought, judging from the outside and other Yelp reviews. They have a lot of large televisions, which would make this an ideal spot for watching a game.   Our server was very pleasant and friendly, but some of the staff has that native Pittsburgher gruffness, which some people might translate as rude. There do seem to be some staffing problems, though. A latecomer to our group asked another waitress clearing a nearby table if she was our waitress. The woman said \"no\" and walked away without offering to get our server. It was a little weird. Our waitress also had people at the other end of the table yell their lunch orders, even though it was very loud. She could have easily walked over, so that was odd, too.   Not being in the mood for fish, I ordered the white pizza. It was very large, much bigger than I expected. I ended up taking the leftovers with me, and it fed me for two more meals. So, while the prices are a little more than you'd expect to pay at a similar restaurant, many of the portions are huge. Two people could easily split the fish sandwich.   The pizza was pretty good, with a paper-thin crust and plenty of tomatoes and pungent garlic. I think the garlic was from a jar. The cheese was a tangy blend.   All of Roland's pizzas are oven-fired, and some of my pieces of crust were burned black. This may be a plus to some people, but I don't much care for it.   In all, it was a decent meal, and the rest of my party seemed to be happy with their food. I'd like to come back here and try some other menu items.",

I'd never been in Roland's before, but a friend insisted that we go there because it is less expensive than Luke Wholey's. We sat at the bar. The service was fine although we had to ask for food menus. Maybe the bartender figured that if we wanted food we would have gotten a table.  I got the lobster roll and was really disappointed. It looked good and was on a huge hunk of Mancini's bread cut about ninety percent of the way through to make a roll, but the lobster itself was tough, rubbery, and overcooked. All I could taste was the garlic butter. Granted I'm a little spoiled because I once lived in New England, but a seafood restaurant should know how to cook lobster so that it isn't flavorless and chewy. You do get a good amount of food for your sixteen dollars as it comes with hand cut fries and cole slaw, but I'd rather spend the extra money elsewhere if the food quality is better.",

    "text": "While in town for WWE Raw we spent many hours looking for somewhere to eat in Pittsburgh.  We stumbled into this bar/ restaurant that stuck out like a sore thumb! I told the manager, please seat me on your patio. We started with beer battered and fried calamari, which was really good, tentacles and all, (some pieces could have been cooked a little more). We were sold on some Brick oven pizza which really hit the spot, the creamy Alfredo pie w/ roasted garlic and the BBQ chicken pie. The beer and pizza combination was worth searching restaurants on Yelp for 2 days to find it and leave a review! Keep up the good work guys!",

    "text": "So last evening a group of 8 of us waited for a table, not very long. However once we got to the table was when things got worse. We were seated in back room with one other larger group...which is probably the reason we were forgotten about all night long. We probably waited about 25 minutes for anyone to even come take a drink order, then waited about another 30-35minutes just to receive our drinks. Several of us also asked for waters multiple times in addition to other drinks...never got them the entire night. The waitress waiting on us was rude, like it was a chore to order ANYTHING. I'm sorry, but that's your job. Appetizers took roughly an hour and a half to get. When she finally asked if anyone needed refills or anything else, she asked half the table and ignored the other half. As she brought the drinks for the rest of the table I asked for a drink and SHE LAUGHED IN MY FACE. Are you kidding me? I can understand being busy, but I walked out to the restroom, and the restaurant was not even full! But to disrespect a customer to their face for no reason....I will be hard pressed to ever step foot in there again let alone recommend this place. I don't know if the staff changed, the management or what but I do remember this place being enjoyable several years ago. Obviously things have changed for the worse. My wife's food came out cold, yum, but our friend, whom ordered the exact same thing was brought his piping hot as if my wife's had been sitting there for who knows how long. Toward the end of our meal the waitress came back and attempted humor stating, \"What can I get you now that I have time for you\"...?! Foot in mouth, perhaps that isn't something you should say to the people leaving tips. Overall terrible experience, service left to be desired and just down right rudeness is unacceptable to me. I am very disappointed in how things have changed with this place. Perhaps some constructive criticism to the staff would be helpful as to how to treat their customers. Be very hard pressed to step foot in this place again...",

The fish was even bigger than I expected & the batter was perfect. Also, the beer menu is lengthy! They serve beers from almost every corner of the world! I thought about trying something new, but turns out I was homesick for a good old Pennsylvania beer... :) Roland's is definitely a cool place in my book. I'll be back! :P",

They had a remodeled a few years ago, which opened the front of the restaraunt and they they've created a patio of sorts that is perfect for outside dining when the sun decides to shine.  Excellent seafood options, and you'll never go wrong with the lobster rolls.  The hot lobster roll is served on buttery Mancini roll and melts in your mouth.",

    "text": "NEVER AGAIN!!!! Horrible service and horrible food! It took 20 minutes for our waitress to even come to our table! Looking back on it, I don't know why we didn't leave... maybe because we had to wait 20 minutes to even get a table (this was during the summer). We ordered the muscles to start off which were okay but definitely not something I would recommend. My husband ordered the fish and chips and I ordered the crab cakes.... EPIC FAIL!!! The crab cakes were so disgusting my husband and I had to switch meals. The crab cakes taste like fried mayo... I couldn't even taste the crab! The fish and chips looked great but it didn't taste like anything! No seasoning at all! The waitress was so bad that when it came time to give us our check, she was no where to be found. It took 15 minutes to actually get the check (keep in mind we already finished eating)... thank God we had cash! A complete waste of $40. Yes, I remember exactly how much I spent even though it was months ago because I kept thinking how I could have spent that money in a better place! I could have got a mani & pedi... had some great sushi... the list goes on. lol",

The seafood is breaded and fried to the point of inedible.  The staff is rude.  The prices are too high for the quality.  Just all around disappointing.",

    "text": "Okay, so it's not been my favorite week.  And after contemplating a dive off the Ft. Duquesne bridge, I followed some ex friend hag's advice and decided to get out of the house to go do something!  Now, being a typical woman, she suggested retail shopping therapy.  But I'm not one to blow my budget out of the water over a broken heart/bad-man-done-me wrong deal.  No way.  So, I go to Roland's.  Now, I'm not saying that they are better then a 1-800 help-me hot line.  But, they come darn close.  I had one of their famous hot lobster rolls.  Sure, David (hot & sweet little server) suggested that I consider having the cold roll, but no, I'm a woman.  I do not listen.  Hot, hot, hot.  Amy is right.  The buttery rolls do melt in your mouth.  The strawberry margarita wasn't half bad, either.   Actually, it was totally awesome.  While it didn't entirely make all my problems go away, it made me forget about them for an hour or so.  And so, life goes on.....",

    "text": "This is a great summertime place.  I have been going to Rolands since I turned 21 a decade ago.   The beer selection is one of the best in Pittsburgh if not the best.  And, I agree with Jason P. in that the best sandwich in the burgh is the lobster roll.  I prefer the cold lobster roll as opposed to the hot, but they are both awesome.  It's a very generous portion of lobster on a garlic bread roll.  They have a very good raw bar with oysters, shrimp, crab and other goodies.  The outdoor seating is awesome.  Sit upstairs and look at the passerby's on the street at the strip.  Saturday's and Sunday's afternoon are the best time to visit.  The pizza is also pretty good, brick oven and thin crust.  The seafood stew is a great deal for about $15 you get a delicious broth and lots of fish and shellfish.  The bartenders are great.  It's pretty well known that John the Irish guy is the best bartender in the burgh', however I think he only works one day a week now.  Bo is very good and my buddy Jeff is also a good tender.   They have pool tables and darts, so plenty of bar games.  The only reason I don't give this place four stars is that they don't have all the top shelf liquor that my heart desires.  They have new management since my buddy Rick went to Bettis bar.  And, they are lacking in some liquor selections since.  They don't have patron or any top shelf rum.  I ordered a top shelf long island iced tea yesterday and was disappointed to taste cuervo instead of petrone.   However, overall the place is a good time and a must visit in Pittsburgh.  Get the lobster roll!",

    "text": "I was immediately displeased by the snaggle toothed hostess and her surly demeanor. The air conditioning was non existent, which is a hangover nightmare. While waiting for a table the bartender ignored us for ten minutes and couldn't even transfer our drinks to the table. He also casually instructed me that one must pay per beer - duh! I'm not a beer drinking novice. The acne-ridden server was friendly enough, but seemed forlorn and was overtly sweating. Bringing drinks to a table isn't neuroscience and I don't drink tap water. After sitting at our table for a few minutes it was very apparent that the entire serving staff is haggard. Appetizer - crab artichoke dip. Bland. Where's the crab? Also, did a toddler arrange the plate? Apparently. Meal - fish tacos. Came quickly and surprisingly flavorful. However, our server never once checked on our status and we had to beckon him to fulfill our needs. I shouldn't have to ask for napkins at the point of need. No tip, never coming back.",
