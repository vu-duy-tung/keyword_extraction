    "text": "Hambone's is divided into two sections. The restaurant area in the back serves pub-grub like wings, burgers, \"hamwiches\" and most everything else that's fried or dunked in ranch. Like most pub-grub it's something to eat, not a brush with culinary genius.   The bar carries interesting local brews on tap like Rowhouse Red (from Philadelphia) and a couple unusual varieties of Yuengling. However, the best way to illustrate why you need to go to Hambone's at least once in your life is this story.  Man to bartender, \"I need six shots of Jager!\"  Bartender, \"We ran out.\"  Man (huge incredulous sigh of exasperation), \"Out of Jager?!\"   Bartender, \"We ran out 10 minutes ago--sorry!\"  Man, \"Alright...gimme six shots of Rumple Mintze!\"  Bartender, \"We got Rumple Minze!\"",

    "text": "Hambone's appears to be just another yinzer bar in Pittsburgh. However, you'll see upon entering that the ladies behind the bar are actually very nice and accommodating and their menu is relatively extensive and delicious.  I first went to Hamebone's to drink and was blown away by how attentive the bartender was. She actually came outside (where we decided to sit) and asked us if we needed anything. Very nice, considering she had plenty of business at the counter and could have let us go up when we needed something.  The second time was with my neighbor, Tate. He's been in Lawrenceville for over 20 years and personally knows the cook at Hambone's. He talked the place up quite a bit and we finally made it over one afternoon for lunch. It was, quite surprisingly, incredibly good.  I've been to Hambone's for dinner as well with Tate and was equally impressed.  Don't judge a book by its cover, Hambone's has a lot going on.",

    "text": "While I generally love the food and service at this establishment, I have had negative experiences when there is an open Children's event.  Tonight it was from 5:30 to 8:00 something.  The kids are still running around and are basically unsupervised by their parents.  This is a danger to the wait staff and anyone trying to negotiate their way through the restaurant.  The kids also attempt to run into the bar area and are scooped up by staff.  This is uncalled for.  I am a child therapist.  These kids should not be in a bar setting.  They need to be better supervised by their parents.  They are annoying to the regular patrons.  A teen age girl sat in the booth behind me and proceeded to bounce against the back of her seat, which impacted me by bumping me repeatedly by the seat.  I turned and told her to stop it as it was annoying and I showed her how it felt by doing the same to her.  I eventually got up and moved to the other side of the booth where I could not feel her bouncing against the back of my booth.  She turned and smiled at me and made some rude comment. She was sitting with her parents.  I don't understand how parents tolerate/accept this kind of behavior from their teen age children.    I will not patronize this place when they host one of these events again.  Check before you go to make sure that this event is not scheduled.",

    "text": "It was a cold winter night and my dad and I were looking for a place to grab some quick grub during my lunch break. We wandered into this restaurant almost on accident. There are two parts to Hambones: the bar and the restaurant.  The restaurant has a nice cozy feel to it. We sat ourselves and the server was fast and attentive. I got the sampler thing that came with broccoli cheese bites, mozzarella sticks, onion rings, and wings (buffalo for me!). I really wasn't expecting much just from the slightly run-down look of the place. But when the food arrived, oh my god, I was shocked in the very best way. Everything was amazing. I know,I know it's hard to mess up mozzarella sticks. But these weren't those typical slightly bland and lacking mozzarella round kinda. These cheese sticks were rectangular and full of delicious, melty mozzarella. And the wings. Oh my god, the wings.  I feel like it's hard to get good wings around here.  However, these were full and meaty, expertly coated in a delicious buffalo sauce. Everything was so good we had to come back! Also try their burgers!! Yummmy stuff",

Ran as a 7$ drink and it just tasted like juice. Got one of the dinner specials the baked ziti it came cold, a small portion and nothing to it just Noddles and sauce. Yet it was a 11$ dinner. The server was TERRIBLE. Was on his phone literally since the second we walked until the second we walked out. Had to call his attention each time we needed something. He just stood in the corner texting as if he didnt even work there. Then their pos system was rebooting so we had to wait over a half an hour AFTER we finished our meal to get our check only after finding our waiter AGAIN. Then when we try to pay with our card he asks if he can just write down the numbers and run it later!... Overall shitty experience, bland food and overpriced menu. And speaking as a manager in the food industry, you need new servers. I've been coming to this place since I was a toddler and I'm highly disappointed.",

And when it came, they weren't even cooked all the way, they were inedible!  Made us all so angry.  Apparently the cook was not up to doing his job that day and they had to call the owner to come in.  I certainly hope that cook got fired because he absolutely ruined our day and plans that we had due to a lengthy wait and not having food in a timely manner when we were all starving and feeling weak after a late night.  Fire that cook, he was absolute shit and now that's what I think of Hambones.",

One side houses the bar, some high tables and standing room. The other side is more of the the restaurant area which also has a stage. There is a back area with more tables but I have never ventured back there.  I stumbled into Hambones around 8:30 last Saturday for dinner and the place was packed to the gills. My buddy and I were lucky enough to grab a spot dead center at the bar as two people were leaving. Everyone seemed very chill and I decided immediately that I liked this place. Service was slow but it didn't really bother me because I was enjoying the vibe regardless. I think they were pretty understaffed that night because the bartender was absolutely slammed with drink orders and the manager that was backing her up looked like he was also knocking out orders in the kitchen too. Being in the industry I can appreciate when you get a hit like that and everyone pulls together to put out the best possible service. The crew at Hambones did just that.   I will absolutely come back to Hambones, their aren't enough good independents like them left in this city.",

I appreciate that they offer a venue for amateur comics to test their material. Most of them were boring, but I don't fault the establishment for that. After all, it's a free show. A bartender myself, I thought the drinks were awful. When I ordered drinks, the bartender looked like she didn't care to be there.  I get that we all have bad days; it just meant I wasn't going to bother asking her to remake my drink.  In all I ordered three different cocktails. None of them were made properly; there were multiple bartenders. I don't know if the same bartender made all of them as my husband ordered two of our rounds.  I was planning to order food but was informed by the server that the kitchen was shut down.  So I cannot say what the food is like. In summation, I would probably not return here again unless friends wanted to go. In that case, I'd stick to beer.",

Good food.\"  I'd say he was about three-quarters right.  The food was decent.  I got a burger (the one with blue cheese, I forget what their name for it was).  Fine but not spectacular; I wasn't particularly impressed.  The fries were good, as I would expect from a pub-y place like this.  To drink I ordered their hard lemonade and then a Black & Tan.  I enjoyed both and I thought the beer selection was quite good overall.  But the service was what really left an impression on us.  After we ordered to a surly waitress, she snapped the menus back with a frown like it was her job.  Remember that scene in Lord of the Rings where Ian Holm jumps at Frodo and his face gets all scary?  Yeah, it reminded me of that.  Then after getting our drinks we didn't see her for a good half hour, which considering her attitude I guess I wasn't opposed to until about half of us finished our glasses.  No check up, no \"anyone need another drink,\" nothing.  After that we got our food, ordered another round of drinks and didn't see her again until she cleared the table and brought the check.  She had earlier asked how we had wanted to get the check, which we first responded with all separate but after seeing the look on her face that that request had caused we quickly changed to \"whatever's easiest for you.\"   I guess it's not a good sign when you ramble about the service at a place for twice as long as you talk about the food.  But that's just what Hambone's was for me.  The food was totally forgettable; the service was terrible.  I would've liked to go again and try something different, but I don't feel like playing \"try not to aggravate waitress\" again anytime soon.",

A place you can feel normal and happy at.   If you are sick of all of the gastropubs and prohibition era cocktail bars filling up Lawrenceville, give Hambones a shot. Get a hamburger and a cheap beer and it will make your day so much better.",

We've been there a few times now and I haven't really had anything I didn't like, although there were a few things that stood out more than others...  Firstly, we were pretty disappointed with the Nachos.  They weren't bad, but the portion was really small and the toppings weren't distributed very well.  Instead of the nachos, try the porky fries -- they are DELICIOUS!  We were a bit skeptical at first, but hubby and I fell in love with the mix of cheese and the pulled pork.  We've had numerous sandwiches (all good, the HBLT is HUGE and so yummy!), burgers, and daily specials and the food is pretty good.  Tuesdays they have tacos for $1 each and they do a good job of loading up on the meat and toppings.    They rarely have beer specials (at least on a regular weeknight when we're most apt to go), but the beer isn't too expensive to begin with so...  The waitresses are nice and we've had the cook come out a few times to make sure we liked our food.  Overall a nice place!  Quick tip: If you're... anything other than skinny, you might find it a bit uncomfortable getting into/out of the booths in the main bar area, but they are comfy to sit in once you ARE in.",

Also, for an extra couple bucks, I had a mountain of pulled pork heaped on top. It was like an extra meal on top of my meal, and man, did it satisfy. The only thing holding me back from 5-starring this place is that my and my wife's drinks weren't great. Cheap, and served promptly, but a vodka-soda and a Tom Collins aren't exactly what I'd deem \"hard to nail.\" Still, I would eat here again in a heartbeat. Great bar food.",

Everyone knows everyone, and the people are friendly. Behind the bar you will find Jeff Holt, who bought into the bar a year ago or so, and things have really turned around. He brought the old Papa J's Thursday Night comedy open mic with him, and a personality that embraces the old and the new.   Lawrenceville is overrun with hipsters, music \"clubs\", pricier eating venues, and trendy places like the new Franktuary. All that is great, and makes it a lively place to be, but Hambone's is the old corner bar. This is where the old steel workers still drink at 3pm, and you can hear the stories of old. Also, they have a great happy hour, and if you live in the East End you should definitely stop in on your way home from downtown.   The lunch and dinner are sort of a mix between a diner and a pub, but the food is fantastic, with daily specials and many many options.   Hambone's is quite possibly my favorite Lawrenceville bar.",

Unfortunately, Hambone's falls into the latter.   Our table of nine made up half of those dining at the time.  No real atmosphere here. It was pretty bland, as was the food.    I had a pulled pork eggs Benedict. Sounds odd, right?  It was. Think English muffin with a fried egg and pulled pork scooped on it.  Was served with beautiful looking potatoes that were sadly lukewarm.  Really pretty though.    Our food came out one by one in probably a span of twenty minutes.  I was served first and was actually finished by the time the last person got their meal.  And they weren't busy.  At all. Not sure what the kitchen was doing.    On a scale of 1-10 I give my Bloody Mary a 4.5.  Hey, it's Winter Olympics right now. Why not throw out a half point?",

    "text": "I have been to Hambones quite a bit and always enjoy my visit for a few reasons. I'll start it out by saying that I don't really come here for the food. I've ended up eating here quite a bit and I would say it's typical average bar fare that is reasonably priced for what you get. If you are feeling really adventurous, you can go for the Krusty Burger which is deep-fried and something everyone should experience at least once. Hopefully no more than once so you avoid having a heart attack. I tried the Sirloin once but it was overcooked and obviously this is not the kind of place you should order steak if you are picky about it like I am. The sandwiches all seem pretty good. I've had a few and my favorite is the Reuben.  This place has a great beer selection with a variety of craft beers on tap. They have happy hour specials, but they are usually only 50 cents off drinks and nothing too crazy, however the typical beer prices are pretty reasonable. They typically have a good bottle selection as well.  What I love most about this bar are the pinball machines! They have one machine out in the main bar room and then a few older machines in the back room. I always tend to migrate toward the back room because it is less crowded and there are also darts back there. I think most people might walk back there and be confused about if they are allowed to be back there because it seems like they use that room for extra storage sometimes. There is occasionally be a crockpot on one of the tables, silverware being rolled or condiments being filled. I assume that most people are good people and would not mess with things left out, but it always seemed odd to me...hopefully they keep an eye on it if there are ever a bunch of drunk people back there.   They have events here too. I've been to a few stand-up shows and Open Mic nights, both of which were very enjoyable. These take place in the side room, so if you happen to stumble in on one of those nights you can choose to join the show or hang out in the bar room instead.  Overall, I really like this bar. It is right in the heart of Lawrenceville and right next to Wildcard, one of my favorite stores!",

By that point I was so annoyed that I asked for the check and the food to go so that we would not miss our show.  I am a pretty reasonable guy, but the kitchen was unreasonably slow. I could understand the delay if they were busy, which was the excuse our server threw at us in passing, but the truth is neither she nor the kitchen staff were efficient. There were literally only two other tables when we arrived, a two-top and a six-top. Fortunately, there were two people helping her, or we may never have gotten drink refills.

I got the Canadian Waffle drink, which secretly consisted of a two drink system comprised of a crown royal maple & lemon cocktail served with a Woodchuck Cider. Not. Too. Shabby. Yes, it did sort of taste like waffles.  We had the pretzel app the start with and they were just okay. My Pittsburgh steak salad was everything I'd hope it would be and more. The bed of greens it was served on was surprisingly sophisticated for a dive bar. All sorts of fresh chopped up veggies and such. Very big, very good  and priced just right.

Hambone's stock and trade is bar food done deftly, and well-played pub grub was all that Kay and I craved after a car accident created a post-workday traffic jam that we decided to wait out.   I'm also a fool for underdog stories and ever since I read of the venerable, quaint bar 'n grill's deserving rebound from adversity (see my earlier review) in a gentrified Lawrenceville, I'd been searching for an excuse to do lunch or dinner there. Here was our opportunity.    The Manburger challenged me, eyeballing not only me...but my girlfriend as well. Snarling, I asked it to step outside, its trademark bacon and fried egg acting as gaudy chains and rings would on an obnoxious neighborhood bully.   Inside, however, the adeptly achieved medium-rare, cheese, veggie, and mayo-laden burger itself was a big, old softie, dripping with red juices that the spongy bun didn't absorb when my teeth sank into the entire layered thing.  Smothered in a beery batter, the ideal french fries were spectators to this streetfight that ended as quickly as it began.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DBJ2En_1IfhI&s=14191ea81d580f30a4ddacca3a8954b809ef99de400fe19fa530e9ee1888401f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=BJ2E...</a>  Also beer-battered and rich and tender and crispy and amazing overall was Kay's sandwich of haddock, which came in a serving so generous, she needed to take half of it home and eat it for lunch the following day.   The Deep-fried pretzel was a lesser triumph. I mean, how hard is it to take a frozen, arena concession-level Superpretzel, plunge it into hot oil like an inquisitor would a heretic, and serve it with a fine, gourmet mustard?  How hard is it not to like said pretzel?  The service was adequate and friendly. We encountered no \"attitudes\" from the staff or the patrons.   Part of me wanted to goof around on the piano, but the nightly news was airing on a gigantic television that is central to the dining room, and I didn't want to disturb any of the regulars who might have been watching it.   Lawrenceville needs places like Hambone's as much as it needs places like Cure or Industry; they keep the area grounded.",

    "text": "Overall:  If you're going for a show, great, go, support local Pittsburgh artists, please.    If you're going for food and/or mixed drinks, don't.  Just get a beer, because anything more advanced is beyond the staff's abilities.    Details:  Two friends and I went there for dinner on a Saturday night.  We came in because we were enticed by the chicken pot pie special advertised on the sandwich board on the sidewalk (even though none of us ordered that particular dish).  While the big TV in the corner of the dining area wasn't ideal, there weren't any other customers (which should have tipped us off), but we figured we could get a quick bite and be on our way to a party that started around 8:30 at a different Lawrenceville establishment.  During the course of our time there (about 45 minutes total), only 2-3 other parties came in.  The server had no more than four tables the whole time we were there, so the poor service we received can not be excused as him being overwhelmed by customers.  When I asked what type of Pinot Grigio was available, the server replied:  \"What do you mean?\"  I elaborated and explained: \"You know, like, Ecco Domani, Fisheye, what brand?\"  He told me he didn't know, and went to check.  By the time he got back, I had found on the drink menu that Yellowtail was the brand that was carried, which I don't care for, so I ordered a \"Moses,\" which was awful, but I didn't complain, and he didn't ask.   I admit, I am a somewhat \"particular\" customer.  When I placed my order, I told the server I was a bit \"difficult,\" and after taking my order, he replied that it wasn't difficult at all.    He lied.  I ordered the Dublin Club and added a side salad for $1 upcharge.  I asked the server if I could have the sandwich dry, with mustard on the side, and substitute Swiss cheese for the American cheese that came on it, and he replied: \"Maybe, I'll have to see if we have Swiss cheese,\" to which I replied, \"Oh, well, I figured you did, since it's an ingredient on other sandwiches on the menu.\"  I wasn't trying to be argumentative or flippant, just logical.  I also told the server that I didn't want to see any onions anywhere on any of my food.  At this time I also pointed out that our table didn't have any flatware.  When the server brought my side salad there were chopped onions on it, and he still hadn't brought us our flatware roll-ups, so I had to remind him about that again.  Although the Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing was decent, the salad was wilty and tasted like it had been made the day before and left to sit in the fridge.  When my club arrived, I lifted the bread and saw mayonnaise, so I took the plastic ramekin of mustard which was in the basket and sent the sandwich back.  My companions began to eat their food.  By the time they were halfway done, the second sandwich came out, and the server did apologize for my wait.  My second sandwich had American cheese AND Swiss cheese on it.  I peeled the American cheese (which I had specifically requested not be on my sandwich in the first place) off, stuck it on the table, and proceeded to eat.  My one friend ordered the Pittsburgh salad, which he said was okay, but there were only 6-7 fries on it, and my other friend ordered pretzels, which she said were alright.  When we got the bill, I was further irritated by the fact that we were charged $1 for the Swiss cheese on my Dublin club.  If there was going to be an upcharge for the type of cheese I wanted, I would've just gotten it without cheese.  It was irresponsible customer service on the server's part not to inform me of that.  The server was somewhat pleasant, but he clearly had little knowledge of the menu, didn't seem to know how to get an order to and from the kitchen correctly, and had to be reminded twice that the customers needed roll ups.  I refused to leave more than a 10% tip and, since there isn't a way to get to a manager through the website, I actually took the time to print out and snail-mail a letter of complaint.",

My friends come here for gaming, so you might be able to see why we like the place so much!   Drinks and food here are really cheap, and they have a small but nice collection of pinball tables in the back. The Elvira table is pretty amazing, and it's pleasure to be able to play such a vintage table.   The drinks here are no fuss and to the point. I liked what I had, and there's not more to say on that.  The appetizers are horribly greasy, but it's so good. Fried broccoli with cheddar, provolone sticks, onion rings, yum!   Eventually I learned that there's a restaurant portion next door. When I went to this side, it was really awkward. Our server was either new or just socially awkward. He barely spoke, but he did his job, and we weren't feeling social anyway.   I like their menu. I'm a vegetarian, and there's more than one option, so that's always good in my book. I had a southwest wrap and my boyfriend had a grilled cheese. We swapped half of each so we could enjoy the flavors. When they something will be spicy, it will be spicy. I was impressed!   I'll probably be back to Hambone's a lot in the future. The food is cheaper than other places, it's cozy in there and it's perfect for a board game session or pinball. What more could a girl want?",

    "text": "Hambone's is awesome. It's not fancy, modern,or hip, but it's a GREAT place. You kind of have to go into it knowing that's not like most other bars in the area (Looking at you, Industry.) And that's what I love about it.   They have good beer and drinks.  I usually go around 6-7 and it's never too crowded. I somehow always end up watching Jeopardy on the TV there???   The food is better than you'd think. I'm always surprised by how good it is, actually. They have pretty standard bar food (sandwiches, wings, etc.) but you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  They do events on the other side of the bar - game nights, comedy, music, etc. - though I rarely go to those.  Service CAN be spotty, but it's nothing too terribly bad.",

    "text": "Great little neighborhood bar with a lot of history. Usually a good mix of old-timers sitting at the bar watching sports and a younger crowd grabbing a bite to eat and waiting for one of the nightly events. There is usually something going on each night, bluegrass bands, open mic acoustic and comedy, \"obscure game night\", or whatever big sports game is happening on the big screen.  Hambone's isn't my \"go to\" place, but I do stop in often. Staff is friendly and prompt, the crowd is never too loud or insane, and the food menu is pretty good. Food is a little bit pricey from what I'm used to spending (yes, I'm cheap), but is definitely worth it. I'm a bit addicted to their Mac and Cheese with gouda and bacon; I really don't want to eat any other  Mac and Cheese for the rest of my life if it is not made this way.  This place is non-smoking, which is nice, but they do have a little seating area (that they've satirically dubbed \"Paradise\") near the back. If you need to grab a quick smoke, you can take your drink, sit at the picnic tables and chairs placed on the un-level, cement courtyard area, and enjoy Paradise.  Also, if you're into pinball, they have a few machines in the very back by the kitchen. They currently have 3 machines up: Pirates of the Caribbean, the old Star Trek, and the super new Wizard of Oz, but I'm sure this is something that changes periodically.  So, in conclusion, go to Hambone's.",

    "text": "I LOVE Hambones! Yelp lists Hambones as \"similar to Franktuary\". Its not. Hambones is delicious.   Hambones is the ultimate neighborhood bar & restaurant. I can't remember my first time eating there. It makes me believe Hambones is as much a part of Lawrenceville as Butler Street.  I rate Hambones on what it is- Old Skool neighborhood bar with food.   I reminisce of my early memories. It defines Hambones of now despite changes. Once upon a time, generational neighborhood regulars smoked & drank at the bar. Payday meant it would be packed. Everyone in the neighborhood respected and loved the hearty food served.   Then Hambones of 2004. Suddenly, grandchildren returned with college degrees to live in a forgotten neighborhood. Sliding into seats at the bar next to the older generation. Listening to stories and sharing yinzer dreams, & neighborhood legends. The food maintained its reputation. Drinks stayed stiff. The crowd was strong. Multiple 9th/10th ward generations mingled with newcomers over sandwiches and straightforwardness.   There aren't that many places left in the 9th and 10th ward that I remember existing just 4 years ago, let alone even beforehand. Hambones has survived the neighborhood \"revival\". Hambones has done so without becoming gimmicky, or adding a goose or quail egg to the menu. (Thank goodness)   Simple, straightforward, and delicious. In a sea of places trying to be unique and different, Hambones stands out for having one of the few menus that doesn't look exactly like every other place. Hambones  does it right by doing what they've always done. Serve up great traditional American neighborhood bar food.   I love that I can still bring my family and relax. Without worry that someone else is dining on a $20 hamburger w/ a $15 side; and then shooting me eye daggers at Mr.Toddlers presence & daring them make noise that will interrupt their artisan meal. (Which btw, Mr.Toddler's been fine dining for his entire life, He tends to behave better than most grown humans dining)   Hambones customers are nice, chill. You can't control every person who walks in the door but we go often & 99.999% of the time the customers are adoring towards the kids if we eat and are done before 9. Although we have been known to stay for live music until later if it's kid acceptable. Finding a crowd that supports families isn't something we find easily on Butler St. (No under 21 signs, table heights, and lack of high chairs, and patron eye daggers is difficult to navigate)    FOOD. My FAVORITE- Fish Sandwich. Two massive pieces of beer battered fish on a round toasted roll w crisp lettuce and tomato. (I get it w/o mayo.) A very large handful of fries. Not my hand. Some cook with massive hands, I assume. The fish is white, flaky, & mild. Sometimes I just eat the two massive filling fish pieces. My dogs luck out w a doggie bag of fries and the bun. Other nights,  I eat a half sandwich and have the rest the next day. Either way, it's filling.   Specials- I can't be specific about the specials because they're always changing.  They're typically very good and reminiscent of the home cooked meals from scratch my grandmother would make. We can be walking down the street and see a certain meal on the Hambones chalkboard and -literally- stop in our tracks to reschedule our plans because that special has been made again.   Hamburgers- Ok, their burger is better than any burger on Butler Street. By far. Half the price. They don't have any gimmick like hand forged mushrooms they picked in the moonlight and their kitchen staff isn't milking goats in the morning to make the cheese. However, I would challenge anyone who would debate my statement to a blind taste test. Lawrenceville's hamburger situation is underwhelming, except here. No gimmicks. Real Black Angus, Real Cheese, fresh veggies, simple, yet exquisite.  My suggestion. Request to have grilled onions on your burger. Oh. My. Goodness. Whoa.   More of the Sandwiches..Tough choices  This is where I like to study the menu like I'm being tested on it after watching family and friends eat through it as I've eaten the fish sandwich for the last half dozen meals there and think it's time to switch up my sandwich selection. It's hard to decide on a second favorite sandwich. Not because the sandwiches aren't good. Because they are equally able to hold their own after my favorite.  One family member swears by the Shrimp Po'Boy. The Beer Battered Shrimp are served on a toasted bun. Spiciness mingles with the crispy shrimp but doesn't overwhelm.  Veggie Sandwich on a Bun- Yum! Squash, peppers, onions, zucchini with a light balsamic and tomatoes served on a toasted hoagie   So many choices! Check them out! I'd continue but Yelp is cutting me off w my long",

    "text": "A few years ago, they had a great shrimp po boy and a French dip sandwich that was rather impressive for a bar. After a recent visit, it looks like ownership has changed. A change in ownership can mean two things: things will be better or things will go downhill. Whether a change in ownership occurred or not, I'm sad to say that Hambone's has gone downhill.  Our server, who could've possibly been the owner (and the only staff member working that Friday night) started by asking, \"Have you been here before?\" We said, \"Yes.\" She replied, \"And you came back?\" Not quite the response we were expecting. She continued to explain that the menu has changed and that she cooks everything herself so therefore, everything is delicious. Such confidence that woman had. But hey, there's nothing wrong with confidence so we left it up to the food to speak for that bold statement.   We ordered the buffalo chicken dip, pulled pork sandwich and shrimp po boy. The buffalo chicken dip was edible, but not all too great. Honestly, you can make a better-tasting one at home and it would be quicker too (which I'll explain more in a little bit). The pulled pork wasn't bad, but wasn't great either. There just wasn't anything special that you can't throw together yourself in the crockpot. And finally the shrimp po boy. I was excited for this sandwich but it just wasn't the same as what I remembered. Something was different and I can't seem to really put my finger on what that difference was. The shrimp was soggy and the fries use to be fresh cut. During this visit, they were the frozen kind you can find at any old bar. What a bummer to cut corners like that: to replace fresh with frozen. I'm hoping that that was just a one-time thing.   As far as the service goes, there was just one do-it-all person working the dining room that night so needless to say, service was agonizingly slow. In the time it took for us to get waited on, to get menus, then to actually order, and then to receive our appetizer (the buffalo chicken dip), you might as well save some time and spend 35 minutes making it at home.   If you know me, I always love a divey hidden gem, but with below average bar food, a cocky employee, understaffing and slow service, I regret to say I probably won't be back.",

Which brings me to my next point. It was okay diner food.   The brunch menu actually looked pretty promising with some delicious looking breakfast sandwiches. Since I wanted something a bit lighter, I went with the omelet loaded with veggies and cheddar cheese. I didn't realize it came with potatoes until I got it in front of me. Plus toast. Which is nice, but I wish I would have been told from my server so I could have ordered wheat... if they had it. The omelet was okay, but the veggies were still kinda hard, like it wasn't cooked very long. And the homefries weren't very crispy, which in my opinion is the best way to do them.   So here's the weird thing. Everyone ended up getting their food in shifts. We had a party of 8, so it was pretty large, but we were literally the only party in there other than another four top. First shift got their breakfast sandwiches. They'd eaten most of their meal by the time the second shift got their waffles. The third shift was 3 people who'd ordered omelets.   It just seemed odd that it took so long in between. I wouldn't have noticed much if it was by a few minutes. But it was a good fifteen or more. It wasn't horrible, because there was good company, but it definitely wasn't the best service I'd had.   Not sure about the bar area of Hambone's, but I probably wouldn't come back for brunch.",

Recently like most of the places in Larryville, Hambones is trying to cater to the trendy people.  The food has gone downhill, which means the service has as well.  There will be items on the menu not available, including the Hambones stew which is their signature dish.  I am sad that they are trying to be a cookie cutter Lawrenceville trend trap.",

When I was unemployed I came to Hambone's ever day to use the free internet, order a cup of tea, and maybe an appetizer. The waitress/waiters were friendly and nice, even though they knew that I wouldn't be ordering much. They even offered tips on where/how to appy.   Everytime someone comes to visit me I try to take them to Hambone's. The atmosphere is just fantastic. Yeah, it might be a little run down, but that is the best part!  Drinks and food are cheap and good! They have live music and comedy nights throughout the week.  Stop in, you won't be disappointed.",

While I enjoy other bars in the area, if I want to eat, not leave hungry or poor, and avoid a potentially pretentious clientele, I'll be eating and drinking it up with the friendly folks at Hambones.",

They have bean and cheese tacos for $1, soft beef or pulled pork tacos for $1.25 and an adventure taco which changes weekly for $1.50. I liked the classic soft beef the best, the pulled pork was a bit sweet for me but still good. They are your average flour tortilla size so about 3 filled me up nicely. I also splurged and got the fried mac n cheese balls ($6) which were super good! Open mic night is also on Tuesdays but I left before they started around 9:30. I've always been really happy with the food at hambones and I definitely want to check out some additional specials (wings Monday, nacho Thursday).",

Now that PHI is gone, Hambone's is one of the bars that can fill the gap in my soul that can only be filled by the greatest of dives. I just wish it would have been closer to Oakland when I was in school. I have never had a negative experience here with service and the regulars are very friendly. If you are around on a Thursday night, you must stop in for comedy open-mic night. There are plenty of other events that happen (I think Wednesdays are board game night, that was a blast) and seating is usually adequate except during Thursday night in my experience. Drinks are cheap and they always have something fun - who would have thought about serving a Hug (the little plastic barrels filled with sugary drink) and a shot? Well a genius at Hambone's did.  Put it on the list if you're having a bar crawl through Lawrenceville, or just start here and stay all night. You won't be disappointed.",

Even though they were finished with brunch, Karla went in the back and asked if the new cook would make a simple breakfast for me. My wife ordered the BLT and we proceeded to have a great experience and excellent food.   Karla and the new cook were so nice that they really made our day. We are planning to go back for their full brunch next weekend.   Thank you so much!",

I could only half pay attention to the comedians because all I could hear in the background is everyone singing Journey in the bar, and Biggie, and all of the other things they were jamming. Also, there was only one waiter for everyone, so I was only able to get one drink the whole time since he was so busy.  The comedy was good. The headliner was the best, which is how it's supposed to be. There was a heckler in the crowd and they handled it well. He eventually realized he was ruining the show for everyone and shut up. I love going to comedy shows and would like to go back, but I sure hope they end up installing a door!! I would just get my drinks at the bar next time.",

We heard her talking to the person next to us and she seemed extremely annoyed and was actually rude to the customer. She then after a while put menus in front of us. Around 5 min later she came back and there was a beer on tap neither of us had had so we got one sample. The beer was warm and tasted funny. She didn't come back to see how the sample was for 10 minutes. The bar was really busy but she wasn't paying attention to ANYONE. Customers were all looking at each other like WTF?! While this bartender was in her own little world... We wanted to get drinks and food but after waiting for 10 or 15 minutes we decided to leave and go next door to Industry. My biggest piece of advice is for management to go back on cameras and observe how many customers came in and left due to this bartender because we definitely weren't the only ones.

Their Gouda Mac and cheese is AMAZING and the black bean burger is incredible. It was beyond just an average veggie burger and had a nice balsamic glaze with grilled mushrooms and onions. Really great combination!  The bar can be crowded depending on what time you arrive, and the area surrounding the bar is small. There is some seating against the wall, and additional dining room seating in the next room. They frequently have events such as live bands or, when we were there, a burlesque event. Most have a cover to enter the dining room, but the bar is always open for business. Definitely recommend for a laid back experience in Lawrenceville.",

    "text": "I remember this place fondly. My husband and I were visiting Pittsburgh around Christmas time and staying at an airbnb down the street in lawrenceville. It was snowing a little bit, and we had just arrived to Pgh. This place gave us an excellent impression of the whole vibe of the city.  We sat down at the bar and were pretty promptly given the frosty mugs of good beer we'd ordered. The bartender was very nice and conversational.  I got the Gouda grilled cheese, and I remember it as being the absolute perfect thing to complement my beer on a snowy evening.  It was a Friday night, and they had live music in the other room. It was a showcase of local people performing. We took our beers and moved in there. I remember some of the people being really talented.  If we make our way up to Pgh for another visit, I'd love to go back!",
