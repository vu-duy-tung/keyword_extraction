    "text": "Went to this Chilis on Saturday at 8. Only had to wait 5 minutes. Which was the only good part of the time there. I ordered the queso dip with a side of ranch. 10 minutes later the chips arrived but no queso or ranch. Instead there was salsa. The sever said the queso would be out shortly. I reminded her of the ranch. She so oops I forgot it, let me go grab it for you. Another 15 minutes goes by and finally the queso comes out. Again I ask for some ranch.... 5 minutes later it finally comes. During this whole time I am with out a drink. I ended up having a different server get me a drink. Now when the entrees come out mine is literally dropped right infront of me hard enough that it CRACKED THE PLATE!!! The plate itself was greasy and you could see it was wiped with a dirty towel. After this I was not happy. I asked to speak with a manager... No manager ever came. \"They were busy in the kitchen\" we were told. After this experience I will not go back to this Chilis... horrible service and sub par food.",

We dined at 9 at night, long after the dinner rush and the restaurant was not busy at all.  By the looks of the prep areas I spied, they don't clean up as they go.

I feel that this was the worst visit I've ever experienced at any of your Chili's locations in my life. I'm 23 years old and work very hard for the money I get, on top of going to college full time for further my career and live on my own. For me to go out to dinner, it's rare but since I used to work in the restaurant industry, I expect good service and understand what is required from a server. The service I received at the West Mifflin Chili's was horrible. The hostess seemed annoyed that we were coming in TWO hours before closing. I requested a booth, she gave me an attitude and said \"fine.\" No smile, no professionalism, and no manners. I then get seated where there's only one other two top seated, didnt get greeted for 7 minutes after being sat. It took us about 45 minutes to get our food that had been clearly sitting under the heat light for atleast 10 minutes in the kitchen. He did not come back once to check on us after getting the food. His name is Geo. Worst service ever. Horrible server that did not care.",

But today, the staff informed me that even though it is not on the menu, they still will make items from the old menu, and I was able to order one. It was every bit as good as I remember. The staff here is excellent, food preparation was very good. The only downside is that the interior is a bit dated, and they don't have wi-fi(if you need such a thing).",

We were taken to a 6 top - fine with us - perhaps no other 4 tops were available.  Immediately we could see that the the table was filthy. I saw an employee wiping a  nearby table and I quietly approached her and discreetly asked her to please clean our table.  She, very pleasantly, complied but also felt the need to tell us several times that it mustn't have been cleaned properly the evening before. We were thankful that she wiped the table for us, unfortunately it was still remained pretty nasty :(.  I am not sure what the use to wipe the tables with???  Food wise, baked potato soup was fairly bland and not very good.  The turkey avocado club was a big hit, as were the fries.  The nacho's with beef added we also pretty tasty.  The double burger was dry and not very edible.  Unfortunately when our server checked back to see if everything was okay, the club sandwich person quickly responded \"yes, great!\",  poor double burger person was unable to express her disappointment.  She had cut the burger in half and tried to soldier on but couldn't come close to finishing the half.  Thinking she, herself, was being too critical, gave the other half to the not picky, hungry member of our party.  He took one bite and confirmed that it was not her imagination - it really was awful!  When our server came back she was informed of the dissatisfaction and did take it off the check but also seemed really perturbed about it and became rather unpleasant.  Let me just say, everyone at this table expects to pay for their meal when they dine out, but we certainly expect to receive edible food.  It was a BURGER (not some new innovative culinary experiment, that was simply not to someone's personal taste) that was terrible.  The waitress didn't prepare or cook it, I presume,  so why is she taking criticism personally?  Her unpleasantness and the rather uncleanly conditions will certainly make me extremely reluctant to return.",

What is the deal with this stupid pay kiosk??? You have to pay for any games on the silly device, and to boot, if tipping your server, are forced to an automatic 20%. My server did a less than mediocre job, and that does not get 20%. As previosly stated, the food is institutional at best, overpriced, and certainly NOT freshly prepared. This place, along with all the other sub standard generic corporate chains somehow still survives. Have faith in the \"mom and pop\" joints. They are out there.

Then unemployed, I was being treated to lunch by my sympathetic mother and bought Metallica's St. Anger fresh from the factory with what little cash I had on hand at The Exchange in nearby Century Square...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DejYUoNfDgUY&s=71464354296ee8e360867515cc3ea70e9cf480a461835074104b39b34ee900be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=ejYU...</a>  It turned out that I liked St. Anger a bit more than my meal.   Last night, Kay discovered a gift card for Chili's in the abyss of her satchel. To the wilds of West Mifflin we headed to redeem it only to wait 20 minutes for a table amongst suburban families and Harley-Davidson aficionados.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DX-H3LS2m3b0&s=4a13bdbf21d3154666b2f5bed0c5fba71d5406e47a11ac924aa4300b953a2480\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=X-H3...</a>  The salsa we were given was more like a cold, spicy soup. The tortilla chips were akin to eggshells, falling apart in the salsa and the dismal mud of the Skillet Queso, a dull quagmire of cheese, beans, and tiny morsels of beef.   Kay wanted no part of the guacamole, so to quell my superfood craving, I ordered the Avocado Burger...  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DoI6Ab3ZCMSY&s=e086023c71ae1bb93acd02bb436403cd84c95ece24f04fc5d89986c153fc1f9c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=oI6A...</a>  Cooked to a medium-rare as per my specifications, the patty, humid, thick, and perfectly fine in every way,  came inside a whole wheat bun with Swiss cheese, avocado slices, and an \"avocado-ranch\" to make it a bit more intriguing than the standard bacon-cheeseburger.   The thick fries were a bit too starchy and mushy on the insides. Am I who I think I am? A discerning fan of spuds dunked in hot oil?  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Do22qU9-Lxuw&s=8fe558739a7bd05119d7e47684c37cd5310e4eccb59a1347ca2fb4742ee1709a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=o22q...</a>  Hey, it's my favorite track off the record. I had to find a way to work it into the review somehow.   Onto dessert...  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D58-AndGTKy0&s=7c65b5c39041c4f64a09300719851a1e4e5e445d2b368b97a658c5053cd7ff31\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=58-A...</a>  Something tells me the Chocolate Chip Paradise Pie is Chili's best dessert. Call it a hunch, something I can't quite point at?   <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DNRfKfBSWRp0&s=6aac894fdc088b39d3c5df19c2e934e9d8f182d647bd89a94f54ed06ab7d6e43\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=NRfK...</a>  A warm cookie dough with nuts, coconut shreds, hot fudge, caramel, and vanilla ice cream is an easy crowd-pleaser considering every other such restaurant has a similar item on their menus. Hot-n-gooey met cold-n-creamy, married, and had a respectable child.   That's Chili's: Respectable and not much more, and like the album St. Anger, I like the place more now than I did 9 summers ago. They are what Mad Mex would become if Bob Rock got a hold of them.   P.S. Chili's used to have an onion blossom appetizer on their menu once, didn't they? If so, would that make it Mustaine or Newsted? Can we expect a new band or side-project? Will it defect to another restaurant like Jason did with Voivod?  P.P.S. Shamefully, two of the waitresses came off like Lars and James, tyrannizing another poor server as if she was Kirk. Ours was more on the Robert Trujillo side; she was new and just stayed out of it. Nonetheless, it was uncalled for. Tense, awkward, and painful to witness,  it certainly hindered the enjoyment of our dinner a notch.",

From the time we got there, it was not a great experience. 1st off, it took our server almost 15 minutes to come and ask us what we wanted to drink. When she did ask us it took another 10 minutes to get our drinks. At that time we ordered our appetizer and meals.  I was so hungry, this was the 1st I had eaten for the day. After 20 minutes, the server came and refilled our drinks but said nothing about where our food was, another 10 minutes went by and she finally came over and apologized and said she was going to get the appetizer. The appetizer was the Combination of 3 things. We got egg rolls, chicken crispers and sliders. The chicken was so cold that at first bite, we thought it wasn't cooked. Then the food came out, after having the appetizer for 1 minute. Just highly disappointed, even the meal wasn't that great and don't very me started on how long it took to very the check...oh and it wasn't busy.",

When entering, the host mentioned no tables were available and asked us if we wanted to sit in the 'lounge'. Lol its just a bar area. I was upset because there were at least 5 tables around that were cleared, they just needed wiped. The host was too lazy to do it. Very rude. We settled for the bar area. Thankfully there were booths (small booths.. One person per side) however, the tables were so tiny. Anyways let me get over that lol.  For appetizer we went with the trio where you can pick 3. We went with southwestern eggrolls, sliders and fried cheese balls. The southwestern egg rolls were amazing. The other 2 apps were also good.  My boyfriend went with a full rack and I chose the prime rib mex bowl. Both of our meals were good. Actually my boyfriend couldn't stop talking about how great his was.  The only reason stopping 4 stars was service. The host obviously was awkward and then sitting in the bar srea, the bartender was our server. I just wish we could've been seated at a table. Whatever",

    "text": "It's been over 5 years since my last visit to a Chili's, so I honestly had no idea what to expect. My mom recommended we go here for lunch because she loves this place (bizarre to me, but mother knows best). The menu reminded me of what you'd find at a T.G.I. Friday's or Applebee's. Even though it was the day before Thanksgiving, the restaurant was really slow. We had three servers, including a trainee, waiting on us.   Food was average and decently priced. My family are experts on the menu and pick the same thing each time they come, so the ordering was paced to how fast I could make a decision. We weren't rushed by the servers and the timing of the food arriving was almost perfect. I did have to cram the last large bite of the loaded cheese fries appetizer into my mouth to clear enough room on the table though. But eating more cheese fries is something you will never hear me complain about.   If you're looking for a casual American or Tex-Mex restaurant, this might be your place.  The 2 for $20 deal allows two people to get select entrees and share an appetizer. It's in close proximity to the Century III mall and a shopping center, so you can come here for some reasonable priced food after a day of shopping.",

    "text": "Ok... Got talked into coming here from a '2 for $20' email offer I received, the steak looked great.  Got in & seated right away.  Handed menu's & nothing was mentioned of the '2 for $20'.  Had to find it on the 'Waitress replacer', that stupid digital game console they have at your table.  Asked waitress about it, she picked up the 'replacer' and read from there.  Wow, I could have done that!  Nothing mentioned about steak as a choice.  Thought we misread the email but it was too late as I had deleted it.  My wife ordered the Grilled Steak Fajitas, Add Shrimp, Add side or Rice & Beans, NO GREEN PEPPER.  I ordered the AUCE Enchiladas.  I also ordered Chips & Salsa.   The C&S arrive right away, the entrees arrive a half hour later.  A Half Hour?  Admitted- the restaurant was a little busy- but we were seated right at the kitchen door and there weren't orders flying out that door.  My Steak Enchiladas looked great.  My wife's Fajitas had green pepper on them!  I usually give the waitress / kitchen staff the benefit of the doubt on really special requests but asking that ONE ITEM be left off the plate and they screwed up.  We flagged down the waitress and when she was told about the peppers, the waitress simply said, 'Oh, I will have them re-fire another...'  It was clear that the waitress screwed up.  What was confusing was that she WAS WRITING DOWN OUR ORDER as we were giving it.  My wife 'opted out' of the 're-fire'.  She insisted I eat mine but that she wasn't going to have a new one made up because of the stories we've heard about how they treat 're-fires' at franchises.  She was happy to just let me enjoy my entree.  The manager came by to apologize and to again offer a 're-fire' but we turned it down. When I was about half way through my enchiladas, the waitress came by to ask if I'd like to get another one started.  'Yes' I said, 'Chicken this time please...'.  I finished my first order and waited... and waited... and waited... So long that another waitress stopped by to ask if she could get us anything else, to which I replied 'I'm still waiting for my second order of Enchiladas'.  She went right over to the To-Go Register, did a quick search, typed something in and went back out through the kitchen.  At no time did our original waitress stop by to check on us.  We waited for another maybe 10 minutes and decided to cut our losses.  We paid through the 'Waitress Replacer', grabbed our coats and got up to leave.  As we were headed out our waitress appears and says, 'Oh, are you leaving?  My manager was on her way over...'  Really?  To tell us what?  That they can't get anything right?   It's a real shame too because we have been in a rut recently where we've gone to the same restaurant over & over and we thought we'd try something new(er), meaning going to Chili's.  I used to spend countless nights at other Chili's when I worked on the road, but never have I experienced as much disregard for the customer...",

But they waited 60 min to let anyone know. We called to get it straightened out with both door dash and they repeated to us what the restaurant insists to be True.   Shouldn't DoorDash be the one to tell them to cancel and order?    The fact that they insisted we called to cancel and stand by their waitress' lies means it took 2+ hours since we ordered our food for it to arrive.   And the restaurant didn't even bother to put the food in a bag.    If I could give zero stars I would.",

Service was good, but we only saw our server once or twice at the most.  I can't complain to much, we had a great lunch and spent the afternoon with daughter & granddaughter!  I would recommend calling a head or getting on the no wait line.  We tried to use the table app to find our account was unable. The table app was good for checking out, made it easy and painless and no wait for server.  We will return",

My boyfriend loves their chicken crispers, and I enjoy them from time to time. We used to come here primarily to dine in, but now have really enjoyed ordering take-out, as the process is great and the staff has it down to a T. They are generous with their portions in take-out, however the sizes of the salads have been a little inconsistent. This restaurant is always clean, and the staff is always pleasant and we will continue to dine here when we have a chipotle chicken crispers craving. :)",

Then when I got it, it just tasted weird. Maybe I'm biased because I'm from the south and when I got the same dish in a Texas chili's it was really good. But my biggest complaint is they were advertising that they had these margaritas and I like having frozen margaritas, I asked for a frozen strawberry margarita and my waiter said that they could do that. Then when he gave me my drink he said \"the couldn't make it frozen\" then walked off before I could say anything. I really didn't want it like that, so I gave it to my boyfriend. Very disappointed.",

My party of seven seemed to be quite pleased with the dining experience, considering that the weather was undesirable and how it drew our frozen attention to the well-functioning heating source inside. The chicken enchiladas were decent, but the tortillas had me convinced that I was chewing down on damp washcloths. Strangely, someone in my group had discovered what appeared to be a scab in her glass of water, which had most of us in shear madness into what it could have been. The server was spot on, respectfully tolerating the time gaps between certain individuals' arrivals.",

    "text": "My family and I went here for dinner last Saturday 3/23/19.  We waited 30+ minutes for a table, which was to be expected at 6:00 on a Saturday night.  We were happy when we were seated and were all pretty hungry so we were looking at what appetizer and drinks we were going to order.  Instead of having the opportunity to order, we sat...and sat...and sat for 15 minutes.  During this time, the manager ran food to the table next to us and twice passed our table that a server had not yet been to.  We were also seated directly across from the POS system where 3-4 different servers were regularly going to and from to enter orders.  At no point did any staff acknowledge us or touch our table.    I finally had to go to the hostess station and told her that we had been seated for 15 minutes and no one had been over to greet us or bring us water let alone take a drink order.  She politely asked where we were seated, I told her, and she went to the back to notify someone.  About 2 minutes later, the manager came out from the back, asked the table behind us (who had already eaten) if everything was ok, and then left.  We waited another 5 minutes (20+ minutes total) and finally got up from the table to leave.  There were 3 servers in our section when we got up to leave, all watched us get up, gather our things and leave without any of them saying a word to us.  As we were leaving, the manager was walking past the hostess station.  I asked him if he was the manager and he confirmed that he was.  I pointed to the table that we just left and told him \"I wanted to let you know that we have been sitting there for 20 minutes without anyone once coming over, so we are leaving.\"  He responded: \"I'm sorry about that\" and went on his way.    I understand Saturday nights are busy, but I don't understand how a table can be ignored for 20 minutes and staff are twice alerted of this and still nothing at all was done to address it.  Hospitality doesn't have to be difficult.  Just, you know, actually wait on your customers.",

However, even tho the menu says it the quesadillas come with Pico and sour cream, mine didn't. Then I  was charged 80 cents more for each when I asked. Also, the staff didn't seem very happy to be there. I sat in the bar area both times. The waitress was very short, darting off almost before I finished talking. The price was decent, 10 dollars for chips, quesadillas, salad, French fries and an iced tea.",

    "text": "Great food and awesome service at a great price.  I like that Chili's has 2 wait staff for each table, so you never go without refills, cold food, or waiting for your check.  They have returned back to their Tex-Mex roots, also a bit heavy on the BBQ, but I think their fajitas are where it's at. A very large portion of meat and grilled vegetables with a nice side of sour cream, guacamole, pico de Gallo, and shredded cheese, as well as a large helping of black beans and a mound of seasoned rice. They start you off with 4-5 tortillas, but more can be requested at no charge.  Also, they have a new promotion going where if you download their app, you get a free chips&salsa on every visit. The chips and salsa is very delicious (salsa is a bit spicy) and a great appetizer to munch on while waiting. I think that's really awesome instead of just a one-time offer.   Chili's has always been one of my favorite safe spots to eat because their food is creative and always very flavorful.",

Handed us all hot fajita dinner plates to us vs setting down in table including handing our 10 year old a hot plate! Mixed up two fajita orders with one having an add on pico and queso order. Sat us at table with cold air blasting down on us.  Asked if they could shut off air and never responded. Used machine to pay and could not get receipt as it was not printing.  Didn't ask for copy as we just wanted to get out.  Sad way to dump $100 for a poor experience last night.  Most of staff looked miserable and not very pleasant.

    "text": "My first time going to a Chili's, and will definitely be my last. We stopped with our 3 kids after leaving Kennywood last night.  So it was later around 8:45 or so. We were seated relatively promptly. The waitress came and got our drink orders. She brought our drinks, set them all on the end of the table (instead of passing them out to who they belonged to), said \"Straws are in your silverware.\" and walked away. Well we were a party of 5, and only had 2 silverwares at the table. So naturally we only had 2 straws.  It was then a solid 5 minutes before she ever came back. Which may not seem like long, but when you're in a restaurant, waiting to have your order taken (and also in this case.... waiting for straws), 5 minutes is an eternity. When she did finally return, she took our orders, and things were good at this point. Nachos (appetizer) came. They were slightly soggy, but edible.  A short time later, they brought mine and my wife's food only. Now maybe it's just me, but I'm not going to eat in front of my children while they're waiting for food. So my food sat while I waited. They then brought 2 of my daughters' boneless wings. After she walked away, we discovered these wings were VERY cold. Almost refrigerator cold. All the while my youngest daughter still does not have any food at all. Finally brought my youngest's food, and took away the cold wings. The manager brought out my daughters' new HOT wings about 10 minutes later, and apologized, which I respected and appreciate. However, by this point everyone else was all but finished with their meals. We were given the bill, paid, and went on our way. All in all it wasn't the food quality at all, but the terrible service by both our server, and the lack of attention and skill in the kitchen department.  I don't feel like I'm being a snob, but when I pay just shy of $100 for a meal for my family, I expect a certain level of care and consideration in the preparation and serving of the meal. **Again the manager did apologize for the cold wings, which I do appreciate** However, this does not excuse the subpar level of service we received as a whole.  Sorry Chili's this was without a doubt my first and last visit with you.",

I chose Chili's Citrus Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing for a change and really liked it.  My Margarita Grilled Chicken dinner was tender and tasty with just the right amount of seasoning.  All the while Emily managed the table perfectly. The others in our party enjoyed Chicken Fajitas and Chicken Crispers and were well pleased.
