The salad was a bit overly dressed but I still enjoyed it. The new Chicken and Gnocchi soup was a delightful surprise - definitely an improvement over the 3 soup offerings they've had for years. I will be coming back in several months when I have another soup and salad craving...",

Eat at the bar. Empty.  Promptly seated.   Danielle took my order immediately.  She, alone, is the personality behind the bar late afternoons and evenings.  Beer, soup and salad.   Mmmm, I feel better already. Great beer. Soup, salad and breadsticks  were quickly brought to my spot at the bar. Enjoyable!  I notice that the bar area is filling rapidly. It pays to have a strategy.  First-rate, cool lunch for a hot afternoon. Thanks Olive Garden.  Best Part: good bit less than $20.00. I was satisfied, not stuffed. (Oops, shouldn't have told you that... now I'll never get a seat.)  This could get to be a habit.  UPDATE:  Did it again on Tuesday.  Does that make it a habit?  Good habits are hard to break!  UPDATE  #2:  This really has become a habit. Delicious habit. Great food; great service from genuinely friendly servers.",

Service was fine, as usual, but I thought I had found a few small changes that I'm not sure I'm a fan of. I usually drink the house Moscato, and it seems they've changed brands to something not quite as crisp. I also felt like the breadsticks were extra salty this time.   Not a huge deal, but the changes were enough for me to notice.   Beyond that, food came quickly, server was very kind and prompt, and the food was tasty. Four stars for a good meal, with some changes I personally wasn't a fan of. I'll be interested to see if Olive Garden is making those changes everywhere, or if its just this one.",

Being a prior restaurant owner and someone in the industry for 20+ years, I can appreciate, good food and good service. I am not a fan of fast food, but something quick, we make it due. Olive Garden in Monroeville has been a great spot for us as take out and dining in. I like the new pay at the table service with the tablet you find on all the tables. The kids enjoy the games if you're willing to pay for the service. The kids menus are great and keeps them busy with the actives on the page.  I usually order the Endless Soup and Salad. I love the Pasta Fagioli. I have tried the copycat version but I like the in restaurant better. We have also purchased the salad dressing. Good Stuff! The Stuffed Mushrooms are great always and I like the Fried Ravioli.  We have not had a bad experience and have had dinner and lunch there with a small group and with a larger group of family. Service either dining in or take out has always been, quick and friendly. I am starting to really like the take out service!",

He handled all of our millions of questions and mods of the order like a champ! He also made excellent suggestions such as the shrimp Alfredo! Everything came out nice and hot! He even went above and beyond by running to grab more cheese since my sister wanted a mound of cheese that she killed off the cheese in the grater. Then came time for our favorite part, DESSERT! He highly recommended the s'mores cake and boy was it the best thing to enter my mouth! I just want to say thank you to this young man for making our get together so amazing!

    "text": "Chain restaurants seem to get a bad rap, especially from yelpers, self-proclaimed foodies, and those that, in general, dine out a lot. I, myself, am not a big fan of chain restaurants, although there are a few exceptions. And the chains that I like are because the food is consistent, you know what you're getting (which, I admit, can be a good or a bad thing.)   I haven't been to an Olive Garden in probably five years or so, and have only been to the Monroeville location two or three times ever. However, my mom had a gift card and wanted to go, so we went. We ordered the calamari and stuffed mushrooms for our appetizer and both went with the endless salad and breadsticks for our meal. The food was decent, as expected. For the soup, I got the Pasta e Fagioli which was very good. My mom had a bowl of Chicken & Gnocchi and the Pasta e Fagioli, and said she liked both.  Our waitress was extremely friendly and attentive. My only real issue was that she brought out our appetizer, soup and salad all at the same time, which was odd. Since the soup and salad were supposed to serve as our entrees, I would have preferred if she at least asked if we wanted it all at once or to wait a bit. If we got a regular dinner, it wouldn't have been served with our app, so the soup and salad should have been no different. Also, the salad had too much dressing and became a little soggy. I did mention this to our waitress, who offered to bring us a new bowl. We declined, but only we were full already.   Overall, not a bad experience. I would return, but probably not in the near future, simply because I am not in the area often.",

    "text": "Where to start... Ok, well let's just start from the beginning.  The last time we ate at this Olive Garden it was a horrendous nightmare. My husband ordered soup and I ordered salad. We were not offered another round of soup or salad any time soon, despite many attempts to get our server's attention. We were starving! It took close to 15 minutes (post-asking our waitress) to get our second servings of unlimited soup and salad.   When our entrees finally did come out, 40 minutes later, we noticed that the table beside us had already gotten their food, even though they sat down after us. Our waitress must have noticed that WE noticed, because she came up to us and explained that the MANAGER wanted her to let us know that \"your raviolis need to be re-tossed in the sauce because they're still cold, so it will just be a few more minutes\"... who openly and willingly admits this?!?!    The breadsticks were stale and not prepared to our liking. It tasted like a frozen breadstick that was zapped in the microwave, then placed in a basket with a white linen cloth over top, to make it look like they are fresh out of the oven. In reality, whatever \"garlic-powder-oil\" concoction that they are supposed to brush on top (you know, to make it actual garlic bread), was not done better than my one-year-old niece could have done.  Meal was horrible. I wish I could lie to you folks, but I simply can't. The lobster ravioli was so salty that there is really nothing I could say or do to extract any more excitement about this matter. On a scale from 1 to Salty, it tasted like the cooks caught a lobster straight from the Atlantic and stick it right on plate without rinsing it off. Needless to say neither me or my husband, who ordered the same dish, could finish our meals. It tasted SO BAD. Do I even have to tell you that the lobster ravioli was mostly void of lobster, too?   Before we left, I attempted to evaluate our experience on the electronic key pads that they now have attached to the tables. The only problem was, our waitress distracted me (which I'm convinced was intentional) by sharing with us the way to make the \"best brownies ever\" by using the Olive Garden chocolate candies. She tried to excite me by this recipe so much, that the electronic computer timed out in the middle of my survey completion, and I was unable to rate our experience.   So instead, I wrote a letter to the store manager. I hope your experience is better than ours was. I guess we have to go back now, since we landed a coupon... Unless anyone wants it? ;)  \"I am writing to apologize for the poor experience that you had at our restaurant. You are a valued guest to us, great food and great service is something we pride ourselves on. We unfortunately failed during your most recent visit and for that I apologize. I will follow up with our management staff, the server and the line cooks on duty to ensure something like this does not happen again. I am going to have guest relations send you a gift card for 40$ and would like to invite you back so that we can give you the great dining experience that you deserve from the Olive Garden. If you have a chance please reach out to me at the restaurant so I can make a connection with you and let you know that we truly value your business and feedback! Have a Happy New Year!\" --General Manager response to complaint letter   UPDATED REVIEW-  We went here to use the coupon we received here the last time. I have to say, it was an absolutely amazing experience. Our server (who's name I can't remember, although it started with a K) was outstanding. The meals were hot and prompt and our server checked back constantly (but not in an annoying way) to ensure we had everything we needed. We were unable to make room for dessert, but we got 2 apps, waters to drink, and 2 entrees for less than $40! Lots for your money, I think, and when it's awesome service, the full experience can't be beat. Happy with our turn-around experience, for sure.",

The endless salad and breadsticks are enough to fill me up, but I thought what-the-heck and ordered chicken alfredo. Also to drink I ordered the Peach/Raspberry iced tea... I'm almost ashamed to say I had four glasses of it! Very tasty! My chicken alfredo was good, nothing special. One member of my group got a particular pasta dish (I forget which one it was exactly) and she had to order more sauce... there was very little on it when it was brought to the table. Other than that, everything was very good.   Tip: It's definitely a bargain if you and another person can do the two for $25 deal! You get the soup/salad, breadsticks, entree, and desert to share. I'll be the first to admit that I do like Olive Garden, but I do think their prices are high. So when you can save a little by doing their meal deals, definitely do it.   Service was good! No complaints there. Our waitress was attentive and very sweet. I\"ll be back!",

It now has tables and booths so you can eat in there instead of those old wire tables and garden chairs they use to have. This is a little secret because when they go on a wait, if there's a table in the bar you can actually sit and eat dinner there while skipping the wait! This Olive Garden is pretty large, but they do go on waits all the time so be early! The food at this Olive Garden has always been typical og food, it's all the same so it's kind of difficult to screw it up !",

    "text": "To say this was a bad restaurant, would be an insult to all bad restaurants. The Olive Garden was one level below this...perhaps in a category called horrible.  I am not a big fan of chain restaurants but I know there are always some exceptions, but it was not the case here.  I went here because it was close and still open and I was hungry.   It says a lot when a restaurant's biggest feature is that they give you unlimited salad and breadsticks.    If you want anything resembling Italian food, OG probably shouldn't be your first choice.  I chose Eggplant Parmesean, a dish that is so basic and is usually my barometer for decent Italian food.  OG failed miserably.  Soggy, greasy eggplant and tomato sauce with a microwaved cheese on top.  I ate a small portion of it and decided to eat more of my unlimited salad and breadsticks.  Maybe this is what happens when food is mass produced.  The quality is just not there.   I will say that the glass of peach iced tea I had with my meal was delicious.  A special note should be made about our server.  I can't say that she did anything particularly wrong in taking care of us...she never smiled - not even once - the entire time she was helping us.  I will give her the benefit of the doubt because everyone has an off day, but it just contributed to the ambiance.  I would say that if you're looking for good or even just decent Italian food, maybe you'd want to visit a smaller, mom & pop kind of place that actually puts some care into what they are doing.  That's what I'll do next time.  I should have known better.",

They can't just drown your food in butter, give you a ton of it and call it a day.  So that's what we did.  We both had a chicken dish that was fine if not a tad forgettable. This was a couple weeks back now.  The service was prompt , polite and attentive.",

We like going to national chains because we trust them and know their menu . We really enjoy our local  Olive Garden in Westminster Md. The service was quick. Our waiter was brilliant, polite and knowledgable of the menu specials. My wife always request specially prepared foods. They were very accommodating . Plus everything came out prefect. The location was about 10 minutes off our travel route. We would have drove much further knowing what we know now. Well thank you Olive Garden , Mat Perozich manager on duty , Peter our server.  And all the employees for supporting the front of the house staff. Btw the facility looks like it was brand new.   Respectfully  One more satisfied Customer  Steve Ageloff",

    "text": "I've always been a fan of this chain restaurant. This Olive garden location is no different for me. With daily food specials and drink specials, it's an affordable and easy meal. I went for lunch and ordered a few appetizers to eat as my meal, since we were not as hungry as we would've been for dinner.  While the restaurant was rather busy for lunch, we were able to be sat in a relatively emptier part of the dining room which allowed for a more intimate date. Our server, I believe his name was Dawson, greeted us almost immediately and was super attentive the whole time.   He was quick to get us our drinks (or at least let us know that the bar was making them) and our food was out promptly. Historically, I've had some experiences where the breadsticks aren't re-filled but he was quick to check on us each time our basket got low. Breadsticks did not taste as fresh as normal, but nothing that stopped us from eating them!  I ordered the shrimp scampi as a meal (normally an appetizer) and my boyfriend ordered the trio appetizer. He chose the seafood stuffed mushrooms (a must!), lasagna fritta and fried calamari. This was really good for us to be able to try a bunch of different foods from here that we haven't yet before. The only thing I wish we hadn't done was order so many fried options  We both ordered from their $5 daily drink menu, both getting watermelon margaritas. The margaritas were SO small, but SOOOO delicious. Good marketing strategy because we ended up ordering more!! I'm usually not a fan of fruity margs, but watermelon has made me change my mind.   Throughout the entire experience our server was super attentive and friendly. I'm very attuned to the quality of service that we got, and i was really impressed this time. Absolutely will be coming back to this location.",

Went to the bathroom right off the bat, my family got seated...even though the lobby was empty they ignored me so I figured what the heck I'm sure I am find them...went to the wrong side of course so I asked them to help and they reluctantly did. Told them they were out of paper towels in the women's room - no response. Sorry but isn't that like the only two jobs you have? Fail.   Server didn't ask us if we wanted to sample wine so we didn't order any which we would've. Heard him ask the table behind us tho. Had to snag an electronic table thingy and the specials menu from an empty table across the aisle.  Returned our calamari app because it was basically tiny balls of breading. Neither the cooks nor the server should've given us that just based on common sense. Entrees were fine but salad had next to no dressing.   Upon leaving the restaurant, no acknowledgement from hostesses again in an empty lobby with the exception of our server who was sitting there on a bench looking like he was going to cry, which is exactly why I didn't bring any of this up in person.   Disappointed is an understatement especially since we were celebrating something.",

I've never had to send back a meal because the pasta was under or over cooked. I'm saying this because at more pricey venues, I have had to do just that.  What I enjoy most ordering is the unlimited breadsticks, salad, and soup -- all for 10.99.  If you don't see that option on the menu, ask.  They do have it. Satisfying every time. Their flat breads are very nice, too.  Oh, and I also enjoy a glass of Reisling with my meal.  Quite nice.  As far as this particular locale, my husband and I almost always are able to dine in the bar area at either a high top or regular table even if the waiting area is packed.  The bar is first-come, first-serve and I actually enjoy dining there more than the dining room.  It's cozier and the service is just as good.  Paying is your choice -- either self-serve with a table-top credit-card taker or via the server.    And chocolate mints.  I like that as a nice touch at the end.  But diner beware -- do NOT put them in your purse and forget they are there on a warm day... you have been warned.",

If we pulled up in a 1969 scooter it would have all the makings of being truly authentic. The Labyrinthian hallways we were escorted down brought us to a beautiful table. Posters and plates on the wall give off a feeling of history. Fortified passageways allowed the soldiers--our servers--to escort us lovingly made breadsticks. Warm and well salted, they literally melted in my mouth. The menu was rich in seafood and meat but also full of pasta. The food came in waves after the breadsticks. A Tour of Italy, with deliciously cooked chicken parmesan, cheesy fettuccine alfredo, and lasagna was well loaded in front of me. My server, whose name I sadly forgot, was incredibly nice. She gave me free wine samples, bless her heart. Me and my partner made educated guesses about our check. Only $36! Will definitely be coming here again.",
