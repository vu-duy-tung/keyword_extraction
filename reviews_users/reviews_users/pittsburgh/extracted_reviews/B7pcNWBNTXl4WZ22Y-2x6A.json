    "text": "First time to Coughlin's Law tonight. My fiance and I checked in via the Yelp app and were seated shortly after we arrived. While we waited we got a beer at the bar and were served promptly. Once we were seated on the back patio Olivia quickly introduced herself and reviewed the specials with us. She was attentive and personable throughout the night, even while dealing with two 25 tops back to back in the dining room. She and the other server on the patio, Cheyenne, took turns checking on each other's tables. In addition, the food was delicious and they have a great beer list full of locals. Olivia did such a great job that we stopped to check in with the manager on our way out. Great food, even better service. We will be back!",

    "text": "Last evening we had a work dinner and heard about this new place on Mount Washington. The three of us went hoping we could sit on the patio with the killer view of the city. We only had to wait a few minutes for a spot there, and the waitress came along quickly. We never got her name but she had a blunt cut blonde hair above her shoulders and dark framed glasses with forearm tattoos - she was awesome. She got us drinks and they beer selection was great. We had the blossoms and lollipop bacon for appetizers. Super tasty. I ordered the Coughlin's burger and asked for it well (sorry, I hate pink). It came out perfectly. My two colleagues also loved their meals. We spent about three hours there hanging out, making jokes with the waitress, spending money on more drinks, and just having a really great time. I'll be back for sure.",

This is a good place to go to grab a beer with a friend or group of friends. The reason it only gets 3 stars is that the food is a bit lackluster. It's not bad, it's just not worth going out of your way to eat here.  If I was rating it purely as a bar and not a restaurant, I'd rate it a bit higher.",

I had the vegan burger and cucumber salad, my friends had the paparedelle (pasta) with shrimp and they both liked it.  Our drinks were well done and too.  The only thing, and I hate to say anything negative because I live here and the place has been packed every day and night so far; (I think my niece and her friends are already regulars there) but the \"Seasonal\" dessert was the worst thing I've ever paid for.  We told our waitress and showed her the hard Brownie served with melted ice cream (called an ice cream sandwich).  Evidently she didn't know how to handle it, so  she just went ahead and charged us  for them. We let it go cause it was so cheap.  I  won't go into detail, I just hope the manager comes up with a replacement that is edible before we get too far into the Season!  Wishing you continued success!",

I came back again cause I thought oh it just opened. Nope. The buffalo chicken dip is just mind blowing-ly bad. I mean it had a brick of yogurt in it?(idk if it is yogurt but that's what it tasted like) and I feel like it is hard to mess up buffalo chicken BUT silver lining. The beer and cocktail menu are top notch. I just will recommend stopping in for happy hour drinks or late night after dinner.",

My friend ordered the blue corn waffle which includes an egg on top. She asked for it to be cooked more than sunny side up as the menu lists. The waiter came out to our table after our food was brought out and apologized. He said he asked the cook for an over easy egg but the cook doesn't like any alterations to his menu. My friend was the one eating the egg not the cook. She wasn't asking for any substitutions she just wanted the egg cooked longer so the yolk didn't run. My breakfast potatoes were dry as hell. Bacon was over cooked. Everything lacked flavor. Drinks are too sweet and overpriced. Service was a joke.",

    "text": "Headline / TL;DR version - I recommend you go here for the vibe and drinks, especially when you can take advantage of the front and back patios.  Go somewhere else for food.  Ambiance - 4.25/5 Drinks - 4/5 Food - 2/5 Service 3.5/5 Value - 3/5 (4/5 during Happy Hour)  As a resident of Mount Washington, I can say that Coughlin's Law is a welcomed and complementary addition to the neighborhood's restaurant & bar scene.  Overall, the owners did a really nice job with the concept, especially with the open layout that leverages two outdoor spaces - the large front patio and the smaller back patio that overlooks a piece of the Pittsburgh skyline.  The ambiance is probably my favorite part of Coughlin's Law, and something that is unique enough that it alone will bring me back.  I like their drink menu as well.  It's beer forward; Coughlin's Law has more draft selections than anywhere in Mt. Washington and they do a good job of keeping their website up to date.  However, my first drink was not a beer, it was a Maple Bacon Old Fashioned to take advantage of their $6 cocktail special during Happy Hour.  It passed the test!  The drink had the right amount of maple / walnut flavor (it was still whiskey forward) and came with a very good maple bacon \"lollipop\" on a toothpick.  You can't go wrong with this drink, and this is coming from someone whose favorite drink is an Old Fashioned and expects greatness when I order one.  Sadly, the bacon lollipop was BY FAR the best food item I had.  To sum up my opinion of the food, I think the intentions are good but the ingredients and execution are not.  My friend and I started with the Chips & Beer Cheese ($7, but $5 during HH), and when the chips are better than the dip, you know you're in trouble.  The beer cheese just lacked flavor.    For my entree, I ordered the Crispy Chicken BLT , and when it came out, it looked great.  However, the batter was very thick & saturated in oil and the chicken was remarkably thin, so it was mostly a batter sandwich.  The romaine lettuce garnish was all stalk and no leaf, and I took most of it off my sandwich.  Finally, the arugula pesto was good but barely there, and more was really needed to add some depth to the sandwich.   The service was as expected and checked the box.  It took a few minutes to be greeted but the hostess was friendly and accommodating.  The server was prompt, attentive, and friendly as well.  Overall, I'm happy that Coughlin's Law is open and will be a regular visitor.  For now though, it will just be for drinks.",

We were seated right away on the patio outside (also have a back patio with great views of the Pittsburgh skyline).  The drink menu has some great cocktail options as well as draft beers. I love that you can get 5oz beer samples for $3. They have a number of cider and sour beer options plus a great variety of summer seasonal beers.  My husband went with a shandy from Harpoon and I sampled a sour beer.   For my entree I went with the burger which came with blue cheese, grilled apple and arugula.  They did not skimp on the blue cheese and with the apples it made the perfect combo.  I also love that you can choose your side and they have other options besides fries.  I went with the cucumber salad which was served in a mason jar and was pickled-so fresh and flavorful.  My husband got the fries with his burger topped with pork belly and they were fresh cut. We will for sure be going back.",

The combination of the inside and outside atmosphere was awesome. We were sitting on the brick wall and a waitress came over to take our drink order while we waited which was much appreciated. They had an excellent draft menu. The food menu looked good and the food was good! I gave it three stars for the service and the fact they were running out of food at 8 o'clock on a Saturday night. I didn't rate it lower due to it being an extremely new place and obviously there will be kinks to work out. I had the carnitas tacos which were fine, but I wouldn't order again. The fried pickles were good as well. Looking forward to giving this place another try in a few months or so.",

My main disappointment was the food. We ordered buffalo chicken dip as an appetizer and I was underwhelmed. I tried to order the Reuben as an entree but they were out of it. I then ordered a Chicken Cobb salad instead and the chicken seemed to be like shredded chicken out of can. It was a large portion but lacked freshness. The menu was also a bit confusing.

While, I love both Bigham Tavern and The Summit for food (and the Summit's cocktails), I'm not a huge fan of other casual restaurants in the area.   They had $5 mules as a special, I opted for a martini but my girlfriend got one and said they were really good. We decided to just order appetizers and share them. We shared kung pao shrimp,  pretzel sticks, fried pickles and brussel sprouts. The pretzels were stock frozen pretzels that were tasty only in the fact that pretzels are inherently tasty. The beer cheese and  whole grain mustard they came with were both good though! The kung poa shrimp was just fried shrimp with sweet thai chili sauce and peanuts on it. All in all tasty but nothing special. I honestly would have loved the pickles...they weren't overly breaded and they were thin and crispy. However, they were super super salty. I was pretty sad because they also came with a dill dip that was also really good. If they just didn't salt them after the fry, I think they'd be stand out for sure. The sprouts were probably my favorite! They were cooked really well and had a nice zesty lemon dip!  Plus I'm always happy to eat sprouts at a restaurant that aren't covered in balsamic and truffle (though i love those too).   Overall, it was a decent experience with a good bit of room for improvement! The staff was super nice and my server seemed a little nervous but it came off kind of charming. I am sure I'll be back again and maybe  my rating will increase!",

No one enjoyed their food- most notably, the baby food slop in a bucket that came out cold and borderline gray. Had a couple of orders of the steak and eggs. One steak was mostly fat, the second order's eggs were so overdone, it was like a cement slab of egg. Which they could have used to finish building the place, because half of the area was still under construction (detour around the heavy construction equipment). The fried pickles were so salty they burned. Maybe they can iron out the kinks but certainly have injured their rep by forcing an early opening.

    "text": "Let's talk about this location. What an AMAZING job Coughlin's Law did with this now-gorgeous piece of real estate. The manicured landscaping and overall appearance is so inviting, especially in the summer months when you can take advantage of the lovely outdoor dining area. The quality of food definitely matches the quality of design, thus raising the overall food standard on the Mount a few notches, in my opinion. I enjoyed a hefty order of Huevos Rancheros -- always a bit risky in Western PA, let alone in a gastropub setting. It didn't disappoint. The blue corn waffle was delicious and the toppings a great mix. My only thought would be to bake the waffle to the edge of overdone, since the heaping portion of brisket and eggs on top made it a bit soggy. Other than that, two huevos up. The rest of the brunch bunch ordered the CL breakfast (a great standard), vegetarian \"burger\" (too sweet for many), the breakfast burger and roasted vegetable omelet (the largest omelet in all the land). The service was impeccable, and our server went out of her way to accommodate my GF buddy. Definitely check out this awesome addition to Pittsburgh's favorite mountain!",

Order two drinks and the chips and beer cheese app. We were planning on ordering more but once you mess up chips and cheese we decided we could not go on. No seasoning on the chips,a thimble of cheese and the most bland salsa of the land! All for $7.00. Huge bummer!",

The only reason I mention this is because before we could even notice it was taking a while, our server, Julianne, was over to explain the situation, apologize and offer to get us anything in the mean time. The manager, Brad, also came over to apologize. They brought out our sides to hold us over and our burgers came out shortly after. Brad was so nice and took care of the bill for us. I rarely write reviews but great customer service is rare and I was so surprised by the lengths they went. The food and drinks are great too!",

    "text": "We went on opening day so I honestly assumed the worst. What a nice surprise! First let me preface this by saying I have lived on Mt Washington for 3 years (downtown for 4 before that) and this is the first new opening I can remember ever seeing up here. Since opening day we've been back many times. They have a decent food menu but it's been slightly hit or miss but the drinks do not disappoint! Their infused beers are super cool. It his a little pricier based on what you get for drinks but I love trying new stuff since their selection is so big and so many local options. I will say one night we went with a group of 10 of us a couple of the guys were getting Miller Lites on Penguins special. The waitress never told them that the special ended and when we got the check they were the same price as higher end beers there. It's fine, but I wish they would've told them so they could've experienced something better for the price but also, don't come to a bar like this and order a Miller Lite! lol. They have fun social media presence (I work in social media so I love this). For example, they posted that if you spotted the Elf on the Shelf during Christmas and told your server you would get a free drink. The holiday beer came in a Santa mug with a cookie. Super fun! The decor is super urban and industrious. The bar is huge and I love the patio area with the windows open looking in. Great view of the city from the back deck as well! All in all, come for drinks, stay for the atmosphere. Just be warned if you're an IC Light kind of person this may not be the place for you!",

For a late night visit on a weekday there were actually quite a few people there. Plenty seated around the bar area which opens to an outdoor seating area. They didn't have any balcony seating available, they had a large party over in that area so we were seated at a table. Our server was actually really nice, he checked on us many times. They were also good about keeping the table cleared of empty glasses and plates which I like. My problem was that our table was consistently being dripped on(condensation) by the overhead a/c exposed ductwork. No, we didn't ask to be moved because honestly for most of the meal I think we though it was just moisture from the water glasses on the table . Wednesday night was $5 wines/cider/sangria night. I decided on the grilled Caesar salad and a sangria. I have to say I was very surprised when the salad came, not at all what I was expecting. I'm not saying it was a bad thing, but I believe that the menu should describe what you're getting so you aren't shocked when it comes. It was 2, what I would consider small, grilled romaine lettuce leaves with Caesar dressing, anchovies and parmesan and a huge piece of grilled bread. The bread I believe was supposed to be garlic toast and I didn't get any garlic flavor, but it was good and a nice addition to the salad. The salad was actually delicious, the crispy anchovies were fabulous. My only problem is that it was Very small and I wasn't expecting it prepared that way since the menu did not say that. The sangria was good, pretty weak, but that's what I expect these days at every restaurant with daily drink specials! Overall it was a good experience, is probably come back, and hopefully get a chance to sit out on the balcony.",

I understand a late night menu, but when you start serving it at 10, and it was only 9:45 don't tell me that's all you have.    Three times there, three times I've been disappointed.  This time it wasn't for long since I just left.  But I keep holding they can get their act together but they keep falling short.  Mediocre food, poor service, loud and less than inviting feel makes me not want to go back.  I keep trying because it's walking distance, but they don't make it easy to keep giving them chances.  I think this might be the last time.    So much potential, so little delivery.",

That's all good. It's new. But let me tell you that the best places on Mt. Washington give the Best service and are Always friendly (see Bigham Tavern). Seems like a lot of hires are new to the bar game, I see empty plates and glasses everywhere on the bar, and around the tables. See people waiting for service when there's four to five people behind the bar. Again, it's new and people are spinning with all the new things to do to impress the owners. Understood. First visit.   Menu items, small menu, some are not available or sold out. Wanted the Cuban. What I did get was quite good. Breakfast Tacos. Price was a tad high since half a block down two eggs, bacon, and pancakes with hash costs $6, but the presentation was excellent!!! and the food was very delicious. Save the hash, over salted, couldn't eat it. I said as much.   Atmosphere is on point, menu looks fresh and hip, beers and drinks (specialty ones too) are flowing and the patio/bar is excellent looking. Whole place looks fantastic. Tiny kitchen, feel a tad sorry for those back there. Great build-out altogether. Congrats. Will be back several times I hope. Can only get better.",

However, the food is subpar at best and extremely overpriced. I'd recommend against getting any of the dips - when they first opened, we ordered the hummus and it came with 4 pitas. Terrible ratios.  We tried to buffalo chicken dip a few months later after the waitress told us they fixed the ratios - we still had to order 2 extra plates of pita just to eat all the mediocre buffalo chicken dip. Okay, cool.. nbd should only be a few dollars extra. NOPE. Jokes ok us, for each extra serving (of 6 small pitas) it was $4! Insane. If you're going to have dips, at least give people enough stuff to eat it with.   I didn't even know what possible to mess up wings but coughlins has found a way.   Besides that I've never had any meal that I was anything above average quality.   But ya as long as you aren't hungry, coughlins is awesome.",

Another reviewer hit the nail on the head: \"While I was planning to mention that they have THE worst fries in Pittsburgh... (serious guys just make some fresh cut fries... it'll go a long way!) \"  Also, TOO MANY things are smoked. Not every ingredient needs to be smoked to make it interesting. If the fries improve and everything was a dollar less, I think the rest of the plates are great. They opened up a taco stand next door but did not fully integrate the drinks and food into their seating area, which is strange. I think it's still growing into itself but needs a couple tweaks before it becomes a 5-yelp-star place.",

Their prices on beer is above average but they do offer happy hour and different specials. The prices on food based on the proportion of food are also high.   Our service however sucked. I would not recommend having the waitress Abby. We waited a long time to have our drinks ordered, which the hostess came back over to take. Then waited again to have them delivered. She then never came back over to check on us. It was another waitress that had noticed our drink emptied for some time that had told her for her to come over to our table. She forgot about a drink I had ordered then lied about putting it in telling us \"it said someone had ran it over.\" We then watched her go put the drink in to which she came back and said \"the beer just tapped\". Just be honest. We had put our second drink order in with the hostess as she seemed more attentive.  If it wasn't for having a friend with us we would have left after waiting so long to order the first drink and appetizer.",

I pointed that out to the bartender and wrote down the correct spelling for him, which was \"Banh mi burgers\". He said he'd pass it along but then left it on the counter and a bunch of items sat over it later on...at least pretend to take it with you.   Furthermore, there is no such thing as a Banh mi burger...Banh mi means sandwich...so is this a sandwich burger??

However after a couple times now it just seems like they do not know who they want to be.  Let's start with the positives. There are plenty of beer and drink options and the location really is amazing. One time we went here for a Pens game and had a great time! The open windows are always a cool touch and they have heat lamps outside when it gets chilly. The bartender we had was awesome and helpful too! They do also have a vegan friendly burger which my friend said was delicious.   Now onto the negatives. The menu is limited- but also so random. It goes from more upscale food to bar food but the bar food all had a weird sort of twist. The first time we got the buffalo Chicken dip the manager actually came over and said \"wow, it's not supposed to look like that\". He did comp this which was generous. The pretzels and cheese I had were blah. My husband said his fish and chips were not anything special also.  The last time we came here we started with chips and salsa. Impossible to screw up, right? I guess not. The cheese was runny and flavorless. The salsa tasted like just tomatoes. The chips looked good with a seasoning on them but they were so bad and made my stomach hurt immediately. My husband got a burger which he did like and I asked him to get French fries because I remember they were fresh cut and good the first time. Nope, seemed like frozen fries to me now. I was so annoyed... we left and went to eat at Bighams.  Also, the first time we came our card was charged twice. We called and spoke to the manager and he was super friendly about it saying he would look into it and call us back... never happened. I understand they had just opened and were super busy but come on.  Again- come here for a Penguins game or Happy Hour but do not come hungry. I really Hope they figure things out so I can at least get a snack with my beer!",

I got the Big Tex pulled pork and it was amazing. My boyfriend got a variety of tacos and he said they were very good as well. They also have great drink deals throughout the week. Overall would highly recommend",

    "text": "So we came on day 3 of being open. So obviously, they still need to work out the kinks. First, I want to say how nice and friendly everyone who working this Sunday brunch was. The managers and bartenders really made our experience pleasant!  It's very nice inside and I love the decor. They even have purse hooks and outlets at the bar! A few things were a little messy, but of course things are probably crazy because they are sooo new!  They have a lot of hands on deck and it seems they make teamwork an important part of their philosophy which I really love!  So how about they had an AWESOME vegan chickpea and sweet potato burger with yummy sweet potato fries. The food was nice and hot and plated nicely. My friend had the soft pretzels and she said they were decent, obviously just your standard pretzels but who cares, sometimes simple is great!  I look forward to coming back when it's warmer out and seeing how great they are doing!",

    "text": "I agree with previous posts. Tons of potential, has some growing pains to work through.  Pros: pleasant staff. They are hard working and it was BUSY. Engaging, hardworking. No complaints. They also have a great outdoor scene with plenty of space. And HEATERS!! Overhead heaters that made it tolerable to sit outside when it was chilly. You win on that one. Lots of great beers, too. Good selection broken down on the draft list by types, which is helpful.  Cons: process. The wrong draft list was on our table. They have a number system for their beers, so a \"13\" was actually an \"18\" because an old list was floating out there. And because the person who got it drank about half before he said something, we were charged for the mistake. Food. It's just okay. Pretzels were so-so, nachos were just not good. They need to take more pride in presentation and a lot of that could be resolved.  It's a cool place and will likely be well attended for the area it's in. I'd go back in a while when they get into their groove.",

We had about a 30 minute wait so we went to the bar and grabbed a drink.  The bartenders were nice and attentive but they made my 2nd drink wrong which was a one cause for not having 5 stars. We ordered two drinks each while we waited for a table and the same bartender made my drink wrong the second time after I reconfirmed what I was having.  I didn't complain.    Our waitress was awesome and perfect from start to finish.  I had the Mix and match tacos which you get to pick 3 out of the 4 tacos and my friend got the Cobb salad.  We split jalapeno cheese fries and the salted Carmel ice cream sandwich which wasn't actually a sandwich but it was AMAZING.  My tacos were good, the fries were made with cheap cheese which got hard fast. They were...okay and my friend really enjoyed the salad.    Overall it's a cool spot for drinks and some appetizers but it's just an above average place with some bar food.",

    "text": "If you can find this place nestled on a corner hillside in Mt. Washington you should stop for a cocktail or meal.  I came here for brunch with a small group - and yes, they take reservations - and we were seated outside, in the front of the building.  There's outdoor seating in the back as well.   Service was great.  Our waitress was super friendly and attentive to our orders.  Every time our glasses were empty she was back with a carafe of water.   The brunch menu has a few good options.  They also have a 'make your own bloody Mary' menu if cocktails are part of your brunch story.  I wasn't feeling very \"breakfasty\" so I ordered the Farmhouse Burger.  It was made with an egg on it so it fulfilled the breakfast requirement.  The side was an order of tasty fries.  The burger also had a nice jam spread on the bun, also providing an illusion of breakfast food.   I was most impressed with how out-of-the-way they went to accommodate my friend's gluten free diet.  They were very careful to assure no gluten was in the dish.   The omelets looked delicious and were pretty much the size of a horse's head.   I look forward to coming here another time for lunch or dinner.",

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying I wish we could give 1/2 stars because I probably would give this a 3 1/2.  First, it's pricey. I came here for brunch and got the \"big\" meal ($11) and a mimosa ($8). Don't get me wrong, the food and drinks were really good. I got the 'Breakfast with a View' which came with 2 eggs, home fries, bacon, sausage, and one slice of toast. Everything was there and it was plenty but I was a little surprised that the toast was just one slice and the home fries could probably fit in a small dressing container. Like I said, it was the perfect amount of food (left feeling full but not bloated) but for $11 it seemed like there was something missing. I also got the build-your-own mimosa. This starts at $6 for just the basic champagne + juice (orange, grapefruit, pineapple, or another that I'm forgetting) and then you can do add-ons ($1 for a sherbet and $2 for a puree). It was very good but also pretty small as it was served in a more traditional champagne flute.   What you're really paying for is the ambiance. We sat on the back patio and it has a really different and cool view of the city. It also makes you feel much more secluded, so it was perfect for a nice date. The front of the building also seemed that it would be a good place to sit. There's basically three/four different sitting areas; back patio (secluded), indoors (traditional style), indoor/outdoor bar (perfect for the solo diner and drinker or for a small group looking for drinks), and outdoor front patio (a bit more lively).  I probably will go back. The rest of the menu seems appetizing and the draft list is extensive, but this will be saved for a 'treat-yo-self' night out and not a regular dining experience.",

    "text": "After being open now for a year and a half, I have just come to accept this place for what it is...a great drinking spot, with terrible food.  It is unfortunate because I love the atmosphere and drink offerings they have.  There are not many other places which have such a unique outdoor venue.  However, the food is and has always been bad.    My first time I thought maybe the disgusting buffalo chicken dip was just part of the growing pains of a new restaurant (although I'm not sure how you mess up a dish with 3-4 ingredients).  My second time I chalked up the awful tasting chips, salsas, and sloppy sandwiches again to the place being new.  However, after now being here at least 5 times, being new is no longer an excuse.  On my most recent trip we tried the new taco spot connected to the side porch.  The chicken taco was sloppy and tasted like they poured an entire bottle of liquid smoke into it.  The chicken itself was tough and dry.  None of the flavors of any of the tacos I tried came together.  At one point in our meal a group at another table was asked to leave because they had McDonalds delivered and were eating it at a table.  When asked about it by staff, one person in the group suggested that if the food at Coughlin's wasn't so terrible they wouldn't have to resort to having McDonalds delivered.  While this was rude and probably a slight exaggeration, it goes to show how people feel about the food.  In sum, with so many good places to eat on Mount Washington (Bighams, Redbeards, Shilho), eat somewhere else, but it is still a good drinking spot.",

    "text": "I've been meaning to write a review for this place for a while now. Mostly because I've been their biggest fan since literally before they even opened and this placed was just what we needed on the mount...   While I was planning to mention that they have THE worst fries in Pittsburgh... (serious guys just make some fresh cut fries... it'll go a long way!) I was also going to mention that I was able to look \"beyond\" the faulty fries due to the incredible homemade veggie burger, great beer selection and relatively kind staff... The food was slightly over priced but good stuff (way better than it's sister bar Carson City) and convenient. Then today everything took a turn for the worse.   (Heads up:  vegetarian rant below)  When I went to order my weekly (LITERALLY. Guys... I ate/got take out here a lot!!) Sweet Pea Burger I noticed a change on the menu... the Sweet Pea Burger had been \"replaced\" with the oh so trendy \"Beyond\" Burger. As a strict vegetarian, I couldn't believe my eyes! BARFORAMA!!! I'm honestly not sure why these EXPENSIVE grown meat veggie patties are so popular but they should NOT be treated as a substitution for a veggie burger. If I wanted to eat something that tastes like, looks like, and feels like meat... I would just eat meat. These patties were created as a healthier option for meat eaters. Actually, I'm not even sure that meat eaters want to eat these things... yet they still seem to be popping up everywhere.   When I called to double check the change (and see if just maybe they had a sweet pea burger left for my soul) I was swiftly handed off to a manager (without asking to be) The manager seemed annoyed and \"apologized\" but it was far from genuine. She then proceeded to tell me while I \"may have like the Sweet Pea Burger... it was (their) number one sent back item\" so they are \"trying something new\"  Um.. what?   Honestly, I know this is a total veghead's rant... but if you're offering a veggie burger as an option, it's clearly to serve vegetarian/vegan customers and the Beyond Burger is NOT an alternative or acceptable option. It could certainly be an additional option... but it's not a viable substitution.  If you've made to the end of this review, the main point is just come here to drink...",

They have daily drink specials which are perfect for people like me who can't always get happy hour. Monday's and Wednesday are faves. Monday's are 5 ounce pours $1.50 and Wednesday's are ciders, wine, and sangria days for 5 bucks . You can not beat that especially because they offer Aresenal which is my favorite cider.   We have eaten here a few times and the food is pretty decent. You can never go wrong with their tacos.  I would also try their brunch as well. They have some good specials for drinking and food. Between their signature drinks to building your own Bloody Mary.   The service and atmosphere have been good to me. I have not gone on a day that it was wall to wall crowded .

I've never had the dish with blue cheese, but I admit that it was good so I'll be back for more.  I had the chipotle peach & bacon burger. Different flavor profile than I expected. The goat cheese had a creamy texture that added depth to the medium well burger.   I'll be back to this place to explore more of their menu.",

However, my experience here probably matched with the majority.   The food was not good and it was pretty expensive for what you got. Our table ordered chips and beer cheese, mix and match tacos, the walking taco burger (a special), brisket nachos and wings with smoky bbq sauce. I would say of all these items, the only one that was half decent was the wings. Beer cheese was lumpy and brisket was so incredibly dry. A positive is the drink list. They have a relatively decent selection of beers and ciders.   Service was ok. Our waitress made sure to inform us of some things about our dishes that needed clarifying, such as the smoked wings are smoked and will have a pinkness to them; it's not that they're not cooked. While our interactions with her were good, I think she forgot about us at the end. We were left waiting for a pretty long time before we got our checks.   If I were to come back, I would only come here for drinks at the bar.",

It actually has the garage doors still there and the back ones lead out to a porch with a phenomenal view of the city.  The parking isn't great, no lot, limited street parking, I did get a taxi though, so it wasn't bad.  Stopped in on a Sunday at about 6:30 and it wasn't packed, but had some good business going on.  I wanted to try so much of the stuff on this menu.  It sounded awesome and I'm not a local, so it could be a while before I get back here.  I ordered a maple bacon old fashioned to start things off.  The drink was pretty good.  It came with a maple bacon piece on top which tasted great.  I decided on sampling a couple of the appetizers.  The Nashville hot wings and the cheesesteak poutine.  The wings were insanely huge.  It's the whole wing.  The taste was great, the seasoning had a nice kick.  The poutine was a first glance a bit disappointing.  It looked pretty bare, the fries they use are more wide than long, the meat and curds were spread around thinly.  The plate was delicious however.  I also grabbed the pork street taco.  Very tasty.  The meat was flavorful and perfectly cooked.  The dish was on point.  One of the better places I have been in Pittsburgh, which is saying a lot.  I've really come to love the town and places like this are the reason.  Keep it up,  can't wait to be back.",

Their draft beer list is big with a lot a variety, it also changes pretty regularly which is nice if you like to try new things often.  This last time I went I got the buffalo chicken fry bucket. It was so good! It was a simple app, french fries with their buffalo chicken dip on top, but it was a great combination. Their buffalo chicken dip has really good flavor, spicy but not to overwhelming, and it had a ton of large pieces of chicken. It was a lot of food for an app, I ate maybe a third of it and that ended up being my dinner because it was so filling. Highly recommend!  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because the service has always just been okay every time I've been. I think that's mostly because they get pretty busy.  Note: They have a great happy hour! 5-7, $1 off drafts, and $2 off apps. Great time to go try a new beer and one of their apps.",

The build your own bloody mary's are an awesome concept - you essentially fill out a sheet with mix ins. They have a variety of vodkas, spice mixes, etc to choose from. The pumpkin beer with the cinnamon sugar rim was also a group favorite!  For snacks I tried the brussel sprouts and the avocado toast. The sprouts were some of the best I've had - topped with almond slivers and cheese and served with an aioli creme. The avocado toast was also pretty good although the bread could have been a tad crispier.  Overall, great service and everyone enjoyed their meals and libations!",

    "text": "I wanted to wait and give Coughlin's a decent few visits before reviewing them. Mostly due to their slightly disorganized opening, I wanted to see what they were like once they had everything a little more organized. My first visit, I had a few beers, a mule, and shared some hot wings. Now, I hate to sound arrogant, and this might... but I have a high standard for hot wings. I love spice, and a hot wing that isn't hot is a waste of money in my book. These weren't hot. They were more salty than hot. The full wings are interesting, but you really don't get much more meat. Hard pass.  On my most recent visit, I went for Brisket Tacos and beers. You really run a low risk of messing it up when it comes to tacos, yet somehow, they did it. The brisket was dry, yet the plate was drenched in a pool of grease. Seems to me like they were trying to resuscitate old brisket with oil but it didn't work. It would be SOMETHING if it was at least seasoned well, but alas... Flavorless and stringy. If there's a redeeming quality to Coughlin's, its in their beer list. It's a pretty decent selection.  Go for drinks and the view, relocate for dinner.",

    "text": "Coughlin's Law is a great addition to Mount Washington. Grandview Ave has the fine dining and Shiloh St has the bars, but this place feels more modern than almost all of them. Ownership is connected to Carson City Saloon, but you won't get a south side vibe up here. This place is a repurposed garage/gas station with an industrial look. When the weather is nice there's patio seating and Cornhole out front. It's spacious enough to accommodate large flows of people. Parking will probably be a challenge on the weekends, but I'm told there's a garage nearby. Get an Uber anyways, because they have 43 beers on tap and some potent cocktails.  This is definitely a place with food worth eating though. You can tell a lot of thought went into the menu. We started with the candied bacon lollipops, which taste as good as they sound. The flagship burger comes smoked in a glass dome that's released in front of you when it's brought out. It feels gimmicky but still prompted some \"oooohhhs\" from our table. The Cuban sandwich caught my eye because it was made with pork belly, Canadian bacon and Guinness mustard instead of basic ham and the yellow stuff. Premier ingredients like these are all over the menu. They also have brunch, happy hour specials, daily specials, and growler fills. Everything you'd expect in a decent gastropub.  So Coughlin's Law joins the list of upper tier craft beer restaurants in a city that already has dozens of them. But now Mount Washington has another one of their own.",

Monday nights, they have $1.75 5 oz pours and they have a very large beer selection. They even had 4 ciders on tap, including my favorite seasonal from Arsenal. The service was decent and the food was good. I'd definitely go back.",

The dip had very large pieces of smoked chicken-- it'd be made better by shredding that chicken a bit more. The  ricotta could have used another element or two. But it was all fine.  What really disappointed me and my dining partner was the service and extremely long wait times for EVERYTHING. We sat outside at 6:55 and noticed happy hour ended at 7. We weren't greeted for fifteen minutes. During that time, I eventually tried to order at the bar. I ordered and finally our server came. When I explained to her that I ordered drinks from the bar, but hadn't paid for them yet, she became short with me and walked away saying she'd be back with the drinks I ordered from the bar. We never saw her again. The bartender brought out the drinks and we then waited nearly 20 minutes. Finally another server approached and asked if we'd been taken care of. We said we had a server but hadn't seen her for a while.  A few minutes later, the bartender comes over and he says \"I let your server know. She'll be right over.\"   More time passes and finally a third server comes and takes our order. Our appetizers took almost 45 minutes. And our meals didn't arrive until around 45 minutes after we FINISHED eating the first course.   Everything just took so long. A night we wanted to spend walking around Mt. Wash after dinner was cut short as we spent over two and a half hours at Coughlin's Law. It's a shame because if things ran well, it might've been a nice meal.",

Everything was wonderful! Our server, Cheyenne, was so helpful, attentive, and welcoming. Ask for her if you stop in. She was So knowledgeable of the menu already. The menu has many choices- great apps, salads, tacos, burgers, and a few entrees. We ordered the crispy Brussels sprouts and some wings to start. So delicious! My husband got the coughlins burger which came under a smoked cloche. So cool. I got the Caesar  salad with chicken - also delicious. It came on a grilled romaine. No too overdressed or soggy like some Caesars. The prices were very reasonable as well. The cocktails and drink lists were extensive and had something for everyone. After dinner we hung out on the patio and bar area. One suggestion I do have is that the bartenders seemed so swamped -- they need a better system for making the drinks. All of the ingredients for cocktails were all over the bar so all the bartenders were rushing around bumping into each other just trying to make one drink. They should come up with a better bar system. I don't think it was their fault though, and they were all very nice and made good drinks. Otherwise though, everyone was personable and created a great atmosphere. I love that mount Washington finally has a cool place with city views and space to hang out. I would recommend this place to friends or families looking to relax and hang out, people looking for a good food and good prices. Can't wait to come back!",

With my meal I enjoyed their maple bacon manhattan which was garnished with a sweet and spicy bacon lollipop and a beer from their extensive drought list. For my entree I had the Coughlin's Burger which had a nice presentation with a smoke globe.  The burger was cooked over a fire grill and I really enjoyed the flavor of the beef.  The waitress we had was incredibly nice and attentive as well as the bussing staff.  The food came out fast and hot.  My only complaint would be: the fries were only so-so and would fair better if they were double fried.   I was thinking of giving 4 stars but the overall experience with the waitstaff pushed Coughlin's Law to a 5.  I will be back again and can't wait to try some of the other inevitably delicious items on their menu",

They have a good selection of beer and the bartenders are very good and make sure everyone is taken care of despite large crowds.  I have even had (I believe) the owner or manager wait on me when it's been very busy and I really appreciate the effort for customer service.  What keeps me from giving this place five stars is the rudeness by bouncers and/or bartenders once it hits 2:00 a.m. on the dot.  Being screamed at to get out is pretty unacceptable to me customer-service wise.  I understand the liquor laws.  I work in this industry.  I know legally patrons can be in an establishment until 2:30 a.m. without penalty as long as alcohol is not purchased after 2:00 a.m.  I appreciate the fact that employees want to close up and go home.  But again, screaming at patrons at 2:00 a.m. to get out?  C'mon please have some basic customer service skills please.",

They closed the kitchen completely until 3. Ended up being 330 before we could order. They served other people when the kitchen was closed because they \"knew someone.\" My chicken BLT came without bacon and when I asked about it they said they ran out. A little bizarre considering it's called a BLT. I also tried to add cheese to my sandwich but they wouldn't allow additions or substitutions. Basically leaving money on the table in my opinion. The chicken was so fatty and inedible. I only ate the fries. I also ordered an orange crush and they ran out of OJ so I couldn't get that either. There are a lot of kinks they need to figure out. I'd highly suggest keeping the kitchen open all day and they need to be flexible with changes and substitutions on meals. They also need to figure out their inventory situation since they ran out of so much. Anyway, I'll be back to drink for the atmosphere will likely not eat here again.",

I ordered chilaquiles....just a bunch of soggy tortilla chips with an egg on top.  Heuvos rancheoes were on a waffle...nor what I expected at all.  I love the muscles and will return for for dinner but brunch left a bad taste in my mouth.",

The Capresse  salad had tomatoes almost frozen out of the refrigerator, they were cold enough to hurt sensitive teeth and had no flavor because of the refrigeration. The waitress was efficient and good. One of the reasons why I gave it stars. The veggie burger is mostly comprised of sweet potatoes & sickly sweet.  They did take my order off the bill. The Summit's food is so much better, the prices are cheaper, and the mixed drinks are so much better. You get a lot more quantity and quality for every dollar you spend.",

Chaquilas came out with a fried egg over soggy chips and the avocado toast should be called cilantro with avocado mash on cold French bread.  Don't go here for the food but enjoy the view from the back patio!",

The fact that they are so new could attribute to the inconsistency. I will continue to visit. It would also be amazing if I could bring my dog with me to sit on their nice patio!",

    "text": "Heard good things about this place so decided to check it out. The bar is real cool looking and a great location - like a gastropub. Looks like it should be located in Cali. We sat on the outside patio. I just got a water and ordered some food. I went with the BLT. It wasn't good at all. I figured it just be a fried chicken sandwich not that hard to mess up. The chicken was weirdly cooked like double fried or something. Couldn't even eat it. Fries were good though and their ranch so I ate that. I would go only back to grab some drinks at the bar but definitely not the food. I was disappointed also when I heard Carson City Saloon owns them because their food is AMAZING. Hopefully they work out the kinks soon.",

    "text": "Even tho this place had potential, the food didn't deliver. The BBQ platter was horrible - the brisket was extremely tough and difficult to cut, the chicken wings seemed like they needed to be smoked much longer because the meat stuck to the bone and was rubbery , the pulled pork was extremely dry and cold. To top it off, none of it tasted like it was smoked but rather that a bottle of liquid smoke had been poured on top then microwaved. I understand this isn't a BBQ restaurant but this was by far the worst BBQ I've ever had.",

I had the Cuban and the smoked flavor was too overwhelming. Tasted like propone would smell, not good for me. The service was good, server was Mike and he was very friendly and very attentive. Good beer selection. My wife had the Tacos mix and match (sweet potato, fish, pork), she said they were ok, but again the smoked flavoring on the pork tacos was not her taste preference either. Nice place to hang out and have a few beers, nice view from the back porch overlooking the city. I will try again and not have anything that says \"smoked\", burgers may be an option next time. Overall it was ok.",

    "text": "Today was my second time here, but first time trying their food. Nice new place, great atmosphere, friendly staff, great service. However I did order their chicken BLT and I was NOT pleased to say the least. The plating was nice however the chicken was fried in a tempora batter that turned out to be extremely greasy and overcooked to the point where it was basically just hard fried tempora coating with no chicken inside. I did want to give it back and get the salad instead however, I didn't want to be \"that\" customer. The waitress did also spill the cucumber salad on me (which the salad was amazing, once they brought me a new one) however she was very nice and apologetic and I completely understood. It would have been nice to maybe have my drink taken off my bill etc for the mishap since it got all over me, but hey I'll let that slide. I would recommend to NOT get the chicken BLT especially since now I am not feeling well at all from the grease, however my friends had a salad (which was my first choice) and they said that was amazing. So overall yes I will go back but I just won't get that sandwich and hopefully no spills.",
