While one would think a roll having seared steak on it would be strange, it was amazing!  The peck-n-roll we didn't much care for.  It had grilled chicken in it and was a bit bland.  We will definitely be back to try other rolls.",

I was at a low point in my life. I had washed up in a shore in sewickly pa after jumping off the west end bridge in an attempt to end it all. A man named Dontell found me. He asked me if I was ok, I could only cry. He asked me what was wrong and I told him my story. We cried together. He picked me up ok his shoulders and took me to a sushi place called slippery mermaid. He ordered a roll called a sexy mermaid. I took the first bite, tears still in my eyes. As I tasted it I began to cry even harder. Not tears of emptiness or despair like those of latter, no, these tears were of pure ecstasy. That sexy mermaid filled my mouth like no other before it. I immediately fell in love. To this day I send donations to slippery mermaid annually, thanking them for their lovely food, saving my life, and introducing me to my Amazon husband Dontell. I'd always heard sushi saves,but now, now I believe.",

    "text": "To all of you who have worked in the service industry... tell me....if you close at 9pm and someone walks in...Don't you serve them?YES!! And if they walk in at 8:30pm....you serve them!  I remember multiple times working at a restaurant and having guests walk in close to closing time!! Yeah...kinda was not ideal to stay a little longer past , \"closing time\"....however....we never turned them away! AND HONESTLY...those people tipped more than anyone because I had more time to be more attentive!! You can still get things done to leave while people eat!  When we walked into the Slippery Mermaid Sewickey it was 8:35pm and the hostess commented, \"You know we close at nine?\" We proceeded to tell her that we knew that...but it was 8:35pm!!! We had even called ahead to see if we could get a table around 8:30pm...they said , \" YES that will be fine.\"-- IF IT WAS NOT FINE AND WE WOULD BE TREATED RUDELY...  WE WOULD NOT HAVE WASTED OUR TIME AT YOUR ESTABLISHMENT.   She rudely sat us in the bar area. She then proceeded to talk unenthused and quite upset we were there to the bartender who would be taking care of us. We decided to just leave. They made it TOTALLY obvious we were not wanted there....because it was CLOSE TO CLOSING TIME!! No one reassured us we were okay to stay....they looked happy at this point that we were leaving!! What a JOKE!?  We called the Slippery Mermaid when we left and asked ,\"What time is an acceptable time to be seated at your restaurant\" and the girl who answered the phone said, \"8:30pm\". We asked to then talk with the manager....and he was unconcerned when we told him why we were upset. I could go on about what I think about him....if it was really even the manager....or just a fellow employee pretending.  Honestly..... we were upset that we drove all the way to Sewickley to be treated that way. My boyfriend was not able to eat the sushi others rave about and won't be making another trip there again to ever do so!! I liked the food the first two times I went but I WITHOUT A DOUBT WILL BE SURE to tell everyone I know how rude and unprofessional their staff treated us. From sharing my experience--- there are plenty of others who have experienced similar situations at this location.  It is truly sad! To ALSO make matters worse-- my boyfriend works out of town and this week he was home. What a wonderful date night RUINED by unprofessional employees. By the time we went elsewhere to eat he was just too hot and fired up to do so.   If you are open till 9....you are seating until 9----PERIOD.   I sure do hope you teach your staff some manors!",

But in reality the sushi is an abusive and tasteless rice fest with barely anything inside. The sushi was very amateur looking, and the massive amount of rice waste was 4x bigger than the amount of sushi to actually eat.  The wasabi had zero flavor and I couldn't even find the cream cheese in my Philadelphia roll.  Mind you, this was a takeout order, so I couldn't ask for a redo.  Not only that, but when I arrived I asked for a takeout menu. I was told to view the menu online because they like to \"keep it green here.\" Yet my takeout order was packed in 2 huge STYROFOAM containers.    The one thing I can give them credit for is that their spicy tuna is actually spicy, which is often a rarity in sushi restaurants.  Nonetheless, I won't be returning.  UPDATE 3/14 -  I decided to try again. I got the miso soup and the New Wave Sashimi appetizer. all I can say is, they've redeemed themselves and I now get this a few times a month. they're choice of cardboard container for the soup is treble though, as it a soggy mess by the time I get it home, so I've stopped getting the soup.",

It seems like everyone who works there is 16 years old and doesn't really care what's going on. And take out service is even worse. They turn the phone off so it rings busy.  So you have to go in to order your takeout  I was told my order would take 30 minutes and then I would be called and notified.  After an hour I went back in and asked about my food. I got a blank stare and then the girl went back into the kitchen and got my food, though I'd never been called about it being ready   So I paid 32 dollars for my dinner and who knows how long it had been sitting there. I'm super disappointed.",

Sometimes I leave feeling like it's the best sushi roll place ever......and sometimes I wonder why I went?? Their rolls are mostly really good and my favorite is the Dragon Roll.  However sometimes there can be too many sauces on some of the rolls.  I absolutely love the Salmon Shashimi appetizer.  However, this place lacks in consistency both in service and food.  Sometimes the spicy tuna is really spicy, other times it is not.  Sometimes you get your food quickly, other times you do not.......regardless of how busy the place is.  Last time we went there I had an order of Tuna Nigiri and the pieces of tuna on the rice were unacceptably thin. Whoever cut them that thin should be fired.... If that was my first time there, I wouldn't go back.",

Seems weird to be out of a signture drink...so I placed our order and they were out of what I ordered...service truly needs help. Our server had no idea what many of the items were which only confused us..but when we finally got our meal, the sushi was outstanding.

    "text": "The Sewickley branch of The Slippery Mermaid is just a few weeks old with the original location in Navarre, Florida.   I'm grateful for another dining option in Sewickley.  It's BYOB with a $5 corkage fee per bottle.  Hooray!  I gave them a few weeks since they opened before visiting and taking a stab at a review.  I've even visited twice - once on a weekend dinner and again for a weekday lunch.  I'm willing to chalk it up to inexperience in the very youthful looking sushi chefs that were working on both visits.  There were three chefs behind the counter working and they still could not keep up with the pace.  The first visit was a completely packed house - and it took 45+ minutes to get our food.    The second visit there were only three other tables that were occupied and it still took 45+ minutes to get our food.  Something is not quite right here.  Again, I'm willing to grant grace here since they might not have their groove since they opened.    Service is OK.  No updates given by our server for the very long wait on both visits.    The food was tasty enough.  But by the time the food arrived, I was just happy to have something to eat to take the edge off the very long wait times on both visits.  On our first visit, here's what our family had:  California Roll from the kids menu - $6.  My 7 year old was very pleased!  10 pieces in all for this and it was probably the best value on the menu.  Tempura shrimp roll - $9.  The cream cheese in this is totally unnecessary but tasty enough.  Tropical Mermaid-Shrimp Tempura Roll with toasted coconut both inside & out, finished with sweet thai chili sauce - $10.  This thing is so sickly sweet between the thai chili sauce and the coconut.  My wife loved it though!  The Dragon Roll-Spicy Tuna Roll topped with yellowfin tuna, eel, avocado,tobiko, tempura crunchies, scallions and finished with three sauces; zesty aioli, sweet soy reduction, and sriracha - $12.  This was tasty but the eel just didn't seem to go on this.  The crunch factor was good since there are a lot of mushy elements to this roll.  After corkage fee ($5 for one bottle of wine we brought) and drinks for the kids it came to $57 after tax and tip.    I'm willing to give this place another shot since the Asian food options nearby and on this side of the river are limited and not all that appetizing.  There doesn't seem to be a shortage of sushi chefs working at The Slippery Mermaid which makes me wonder why it took so long for food to be leaving the sushi counter.",

My wife  looked at the girls and told them we just drove from the South Hills. Their reply was \"sorry.\" This place gets an F for customer service.

I am told I cannot be seated in the bar area because the kitchen is too backed up.  The previous occasion I was here, with a group of 8 guys, we nearly left because we weren't permitted to even SIT in the patio area and have drinks because the KITCHEN was too backed up??

She called me \"girlie\" the whole time.  I thought that was weird being double her age but I got over it.  The have a few GF (gluten free) items on the menu and were accommodating when I wanted to remove the crunchies off a roll to make it GF.  I ordered the 8 piece sashimi chef choice.  They included cooked shrimp in it.  I thought that was cheap because that's really not sashimi.  The fish was fresh and cut in bite size pieces.  Nice presentation.  The Tritan Tuna roll was the 2nd order and in asked to remove the  crunchies.  After waiting 20 minutes at 6:00 on a Thursday, it finally showed up wrong.  It had the crunchies on it.  They took it back and brought out a new one.  I asked for gluten free soy sauce and she brought out a small square dish and failed to telle that she was charging me extra for it.  No where on the menu does it say that gluten free soy sauce costs extra.  The roll was good.  I also ordered the edamame which was so salty!  They literally dumped a shaker of salt on it.  Got the check and was shocked to see that the soy sauce cost me $.75.  I realize that its only $.75 but really?????  I find that ridiculous! I can't say I would come back as there are other sushi places that serve fresh fish.  The rolls were priced a little high for the size and quantity.",

One thing I've noticed consistently is that service can be slightly standoffish.  I'm not sure how better to describe it--not rude, but not overly friendly.  Overall, I'm glad to see something other than a cafe or high end new American/Continental restaurant added to the Sewickley scene, and I will continue to be an occasional patron of the \"Slippy Mermaid\", as I like to call it.",

Sushi rolls were different than traditional Japanese, I though their sashimi was scarce for the price, but overall good food.  Here is my issue, we waited for almost an hour, had drinks at the bar and waited for a table, after being told that it would only be about a 20min wait. Then after being seated waited over 15min to get our first Apps, we ordered our main rolls and then wanted to order more rolls and were told the kitchen was closed at 9pm. The restaurant was still mostly filled and they would not serve us any more food, the waiter offered us some sushi rice to take out instead. Unreal! I can't believe that you would turn away paying customers at 9pm. They have a popular business, but are not very good at running a business. It felt like a bunch of snooty preppy kids running the place and really didn't care about their customers and catered to only specific people they knew.  If your a good sushi chef and know a little about customer service, there is a great business opportunity in Sewickley, Pennsylvania.  We had to order a pizza from Angelia's to satisfy our hunger, they serve pizza's past 9pm in Moon County.",

The menu is disorganized and the offerings are dominated by enough over-the-top concoctions to make Guy Fieri blush.  For example, the \"Sexy Mermaid\" consists of \"steamed shrimp, cream cheese, bacon, fresh jalapenos and tempura crunch inside; topped with yellowfin tuna, house garlic sauce, sriracha, fresh cilantro and thin lime slices.\"    When you don't cook the fish, knife skills are essential.  The last time we were there, most of the fish was poorly cut. The tuna in the poke seemed to be cut with the grain of the fish making it chewy.  The raw onion masked anything that might be mistaken for flavor.    The decor is more Trader Joe's than tiki, and the front-of-house staff seemed entirely disengaged.  Through out our entire meal, we sat behind a table of ten teenaged-girls who spent 45 minutes brushing and braiding each other's hair, 10 feet from the open kitchen.  Not the most appetizing way to spend an evening.    If you're looking for \"sushi\" in Sewickly, this is pretty much your only option, but I'd consider a drive if you have the time.",

We checked the website to be sure they wouldn't close first. Upon arrival, the host had just turned someone away and then he told us that they were closed. But we had driven 40 minutes just to come HERE and the website said it closed at 10pm and it was 9:10pm! It was also my friends birthday, so he agreed to let us in if we ate in the bar area. Alright! We actually ended up eating outside because it was a nice night and they have a firepit and cool ambience out there. We were the only ones out there and we loved it. We ordered the singing mermaid, dragon roll, and the tuna reef roll. We were BLOWN AWAY by the flavors and freshness!! AMAZING. I will be back for more!  Another plus, there's wine ON TAP. Yep, that's right. I had red blend and my friend had Prosecco. Sweet!  Oh, it's also worth mentioning that the owner himself had let us stay after they were closed, our food was prepared very fast, and he was super friendly.",

The other evening was a 2nd time in 2 weeks, and we brought a friend along, and now he's a fan too.  We love their sushi, Rock-n-Roll, Flirty Mermaid, and Dragon Roll just to name a few.  Good edamame too!  We liked the Ahi Tuna Poke as well, just thought the raw tuna pieces needed a little more marinade and seasoning.    Their House Bar Drinks are phenomenal, especially the \"Pain Killer\" and the \"Jet Pilot\" which thanks to the 150 proof rum & other rums, etc. added to this drink, makes you feel like you're flying at 30,000 feet!  Would love to someday try their pitcher of Sangria.    Eddie our server the first time we were there, was fantastic, and at the bar, both Trey, and Reese (who runs the place), are both very competent at making great drinks!  Make sure if you go, that you try to get an outdoor, patio table, and ask them to bring some sampling of the sauces & aioli's in addition to what you have on your plated sushi.  Fun place to hang out, with patio-centered long gas fire pit on such a beautiful evening.  Check out the indoor Tiki Bar too!  Very Cool!  Stay Great Slippery Mermaid!!",

The issue is that I went to eat here last night and it took 1 1/2 hours to bring sushi to my table of 6.  Are you kidding me???!!!  I know it was a Friday during lent but please, service should be way better.  This place is not that large and the ratio of employees to customers was very high.  We didn't see our waitress for over 20min at one point.  After the extremely long wait, we asked for an additional roll and we're told it would be 35min.  The food is really good but that does not offset the long lead times and questionable service.",

We came with wine in hand and the server told us that as of last week, they have a bar. I pressed about a transition period, allowing BYOB until regular customers get used to the change, and she said you can drink the wine you brought for a $30 corkage fee. They have no drinks menus, no wine list yet they felt confident to charge $8 a glass. We were disappointed in the customer service before we even ordered.  I have been there three times and their menu of rolls is impressive. I have yet to try to the nigiri or sashimi. The rolls are unique and colorful with unexpected favors and ingredients. After the novelty has worn off, I am left feeling like it's the equivalent to \"kids meal sushi\" where the frills and creative nature of the sauces, etc., distract you from the fish and leave you wondering if there was any inside at all.  With every visit, I was less impressed. For that, I'll spend my money on better sushi for the price elsewhere in the city.",

The inside and outside smells like cleaning solution. We have eaten onsite before and it isn't a one off. I think they survive on little competition.

Recently they have opened an indoor Tiki Bar and there is outside seating behind the restaurant, which is nice for cooler summer evenings.  Based upon what I have paid at other local locations where the sushi is made fresh, I don't think the prices are that out of line and there is certainly a great many options not found at most other places.  If I have one complaint, it is that they are no longer BYOB since the bar opened, and if you are a wine drinker, the bar is not cheap. Currently there is no Happy Hour which means that you pay $8 for a glass of the house white, which costs $9.99/bottle in the PLCB store 110 ft away.  Pittsburgh is known for the obscene way in which restaurants overprice drinks, especially wine, and a 400% markup is not uncommon though I don't expect to pay that much for what is, essentially, a neighborhood eatery. For now, I'll be getting take out and saving my money for the sushi.",

These sushi slices were larger than usual for sure, which were filling. The rolls were also reasonably priced.

I have been to the Mermaid over a half dozen times and last night may have been my last. I was with a party of six and we knew that there always is a wait so we had a couple beers at the bar and placed our food order there. We kept it very simple by just ordering about three rolls of four different types. The order was ready and the owner would not serve us because there was no table for us, even though there was outdoor seating for about 30. After a not not so friendly discussion with the owner, we were permitted to eat outside.  It's almost funny that we had to negotiate with the owner to spend ~$500 at her establishment.   Bottom line... very good sushi and wait staff. Very poor management and ownership.",

The food is great but every time I am here the service sucks, even for to go orders. If they tell you 25 minutes, don't leave your house for at least 30 to pick it up.",

The owner has a bunch of what seem like teenagers running the place and the manager has not a clue how to run a business or deal with customers. I have seen the Waitress and hostess stand around on their phones, while customers go without drink refills and forever getting service. It's a shame really, there was potential for this place to do well, but the caliber of kids they are hiring to run it will keep them from having a lasting business. Disappointing.",

The sauce that is used overtop the California roll creates a unique twist on the classic dish. I have on some visits had crunchies on top of the sassy mermaid, and on other visits it did not. Not sure if it is or isn't supposed to be a part of the dish, but it definitely makes it much better!",

I really do enjoy sushi rolls, however, and the Slippery Mermaid gives people like me so many more options than just California or Shrimp Tempura rolls.  The Tropical Mermaid is my favorite, but I also love the Steeler's Pleaser and the Psycho Mermaid.  Also, the Tiki Bar has some amazing cocktails - the pineapple mojito is my favorite!! The atmosphere is great - very bright and cheery and clean!! I highly recommend a trip to The Slippery Mermaid!!",

Nothing special. Then we ordered four different rolls to share with my fiance. The presentation was great and we enjoyed all rolls. The sushi tasted fresh and had good flavors. Would come here again if in the area but probably wouldn't make a trip just for their sushi. The town itself is cute.",

You can definitely tell the kids working here are just bratty little rich Sewickley teens whose parents made them get a job. The sushi was horrible, I ordered an avocado roll and it was disgusting. I had to pick out all the avocado because it was nasty and old.  Hire good people who will treat your customers with respect and don't serve anything that's not fresh, this is disgraceful, especially for the price! If I'm paying this much money for sushi, I at least expect the ingredients to be fresh. I am truly appalled. Never eating here again.",

Not a giant sushi guy but I've had a good amount before and I have a def-acclaimed, well-established palette in general so I can say fairly confidently: this stuff was good!

Some folks don't like the decor. Personally, It's not my jam but it's easily ignored.   Some folks don't like the service. I'm with them on that one. The service here is consistently inconsistent. It ranges from either sort of ok or terrible, depending on when you go. Want a refill on your drink? Good luck, friend, and you WILL want a refill on your drink, as everything comes in small plastic cups. They wait so long to bring you the check that it's like they don't want you to leave. Not that they give you the option to spend more money, mind you, as your server will ghost at the earliest opportunity.  What everyone agrees on here is the food, and that it is good. This is not a point I will argue. The sushi is always well constructed, flavorful and overall a great experience. I wish I could say the same for the rest of the place.",

Again, the sushi was delicious,  can't fault that. I'll just know better next time... go there for the sushi, but, drink water.",

Needless to say, three tables cleaned up and we were still sitting there waiting although we were the only ones left on the line. Then strolling comes the hostess on her phone and she finally seats us.  Our waitress on the other hand was very nice and attentive. I definitely did not like the atmosphere and how a sushi experience should be. It felt more like you were at a bar eating cheap sushi appetizers as they give you plastic cups and plates. However, your paying premium for this sushi as is priced higher than other joints around Pittsburgh. I got the shrimp tempura roll and the eel roll. I was extremely disappointed as we had waited over 30 minutes to get our food and my eel/shrimp tempura were somewhat cold. The rice itself was mushy which I find kind of gross. My husband did like his rolls but I wasn't impressed with this place. I definitely will not be returning here.",

My rainbow roll and maki were both pretty decent I just didn't get the sauces on them.  The bartender I ordered from was very friendly.",

My friend and I came during lunch in the middle of the week, and I should have guessed from the sparse amount of patrons that it really wasn't a popular spot. Oh well...  First of the waitress was hard to hear and had the most annoying voice EVER. I know that isn't the nicest thing to say, but if she had proper training she would at least know to speak up and enunciate so that the customers can hear what she says. Not to mention she was at the table like every 5 minutes I swear, also annoying.   We started with an order if edamame. They were fine, nothing special. They needed more salt, basically tasteless. The two of us decided on 3 rolls. The shrimp tempura, crab roll and the Summertime signature roll. The signature roll was nasty, absolutely tasteless. A total waste of $. The crab roll was tolerable and the cheapest roll, the Shrimp Tempura was the best by far. I would never come back here again, we would have been happier going to eat fast food.",

This has actually happened a few times and I understand being short staffed, but since it does happen often maybe get a couple of extra hands a shifts. Sushi is delicious and fresh!! The issue is it is a little pricey and the portions vary even if you order the same thing. Sometimes the roll is PACKED with sauces, flavor, ingredients (which you expect for $14 a roll roughly) and other times it is small and unfinished looking. Good taste, little pricey, but fresh and clean always.  The consistency of the servings and service is my overall rate lowering reason.",

There is parking on the street, convenient. If you haven't been to Sewickley, you should check it out.. beautiful town.   The restaurant itself is poorly lit (I'll say that) but other than that I was really digging the palm trees, bamboo walls, bright blue paint.. I felt like I was somewhere tropical!  I ordered a pineapple mojito which was great but a little too sweet for me, next I had a glass of salv Blanca which was cold & delicious, huge serving.  The sushi was FRESH, and my signature roll was out of this world.  Our waitress was sweet and attentive.   Hours are a little silly so check them before you plan a trip to SM.  5 starts, loved It here and can't wait to go back.  Rumor has it there is outdoor seating in warmer months, think I may be able to bring my 4 legged BFF.",

I went with the Spicy Mermaid, Dragon and Poseidon Rolls. All very good. All very large. Each roll was 8 pieces each. Great sauces on top of each different roll.   The dining room is nice but there are not nearly enough tables for the crowds that wanted to eat there on a Friday night. There are a few areas that have a lot of open space where they can add a few more tables in my opinion.  The bar area has extra seating and has a tiki feel. There's a specialty drink menu that has some interesting concoctions.  Overall a great dinner. I'll go back, but will be careful to get there early so not to spend most of my night waiting for a table.",

    "text": "Sushi, oh sushi... how do I love thee? Let me count the ways.  I probably eat sushi once a week at minimum.  Sometimes more, never less.  Yet I had never been to the Slippery Mermaid!  I know, I know. I'll give you a moment to pick your jaw up off the floor... got it?  Good? Ok.  I stopped in here for dinner with a friend this week and loved the bright, clean, and airy decor.  We got here at 4:30 on a Thursday so there was no issue with getting a table on the sushi bar side right away.   I ordered a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, the Tuna Reef salad, and the Whale of a Roll.  Our waitress was so nice and our food arrived SO fast.  I think it was less than 5 minutes before my Tuna Reef salad was in front of me.  I could probably order this every day for the rest of my life and not get sick of it - it's everything I love.  Nicely sized pieces of fresh yellowfin tuna served over a decent helping of seaweed salad for $10?  I'll take two!  So good.  I will definitely be back even if it's just to eat this as my meal!     Our rolls came out shortly after, and holy moly - they almost looked too good to eat.  I was extremely impressed with the construction of these rolls.  Everything held together well, the fish/fillings were perfectly portioned, and the rice was excellent.  I loved how each piece was soft and easy to consume in one bite.  I've been to many a sushi place and can tell you that more often than not, they pack their rolls too tight.  These were perfectly done.  And while the rolls are all dolled up with varying sauces and garnishes, I didn't feel like it was overdone.  The sweet chili sauce that was drizzled on my roll was just enough to add a sweet punch of flavor without overpowering or masking the fish itself.  My bill for the three items (wine, salad, and roll) was $35 and I left here feeling content and happy with my meal. You can't put a price on that.  I imagine I'll be back here trying some of their other crazy creations very, very soon!",

    "text": "Is there a no star option? After reading several reviews about poor service I went anyway. I'm new to the area and have been craving sushi. I need to find my new sushi place for date nights. I took my daughter at lunch to give it a test run before wasting a date night. Glad I did. I won't waste my time here again. Read on for the details. Or save yourself some time and choose a different restaurant.   I was seated. My daughter(19 months old) was given a high chair and I got her going on her lunch that I had packed since she hardly eats anything.   I decided to check the time after getting her settled in. 12:18. 6 tables being waited on. A few more open. The hostess who seated me has walked by me twice now and hasn't noticed that I still haven't been greeted for a drink order. 15 years as a server and you know there is a sign for that... beverage napkins, or similar, left on the table.   Another minute goes by and a server (or food runner?) brings food to another table. Shortly thereafter, I see another employee at the cash register directly in front of me. Still no acknowledgement to my presence. This place is not busy enough to be entirely ignored. Not even a \"has anyone been with you yet?\"    Another server fills an ice tea pitcher and brings it to the table across from me. Never acknowledges my presence with eye contact maybe indicating she will greet me after a drink refill. At this point I'm packing up my daughters diaper bag. Check the time: 12:22.   4 minutes on a Tuesday afternoon and not one person has acknowledged me. It doesn't seem long, but go sit somewhere without your phone (and a toddler) and see how long 4 minutes takes. If I'm not mistaken the industry standard for greeting a table is one minute.   I leave. On the way out, I spy the hostess sitting in the adjacent room staring down (probably on her phone?) i asked if their \"service is always this terrible?\"  And let her know it was my first visit and I won't be back. They just lost a customer.   If I wait over 5 minutes for someone to say they will be right with me, how long does the food take?! Wow?! I guess I won't be around to find out.    Service is often more important than how good the food tastes.   There are plenty of places to eat. I'll try another.",

Once our waitress came over, she was very nice.  The first roll we got was the dragon roll. This was very good. I love everything spicy tune and eel. 4/5  The fiesta mermaid was probably the favorite. It has a spicy taste of jalapeno salsa. 5/5  The whale of a roll was good too but nothing special. 3.5/5  The triton's tuna was our least favorite. I thought the tuna tartare was going to be better than it was. I'm also not a fan of wasabi aioli. 3/5  The flaming mermaid had an awesome garlic taste to it. This was good. 4/5  I topped it off with the pineapple mojito. The touch of ginger ale was a great addition. I wish there was more! 4/5  Will definitely be coming back soon.",

I was a little disappointed everything was served on paper, even the sushi platter.  The inside had a beachy feel though, and they did have a cool island drink menu.  I think next time I'm in the area, I would try one of the other Sewickley resteraunts since there are many different options.",

    "text": "We love love love sushi , so finding new places is always fun. We were hanging with friends who always come here so we decided to.  We ordered an assortment of rolls between of four or us. I can't remember them all but to be honest , they were all very good. All the food was fresh and the rolls were full.  About 8 pieces come with each roll you select.   It appeared the most of the rolls were similar. They had lots of options, but they were all very similar. They just changed one or two items in each roll. It wasn't a bad thing to me but my boyfriend loves options and he felt like there weren't as many. I didn't mind at all. The other reason I didn't give 5 stars is because service was not great. It wasn't full at all, so it was kind of strange. We waited about 20 to 25 minutes after we sat down to order food after we ordered drinks. Luckily, we were there with a small group so it wasn't bad but it was really noticeable.  The prices for the food was super comparable and competitive for what we ordered. I thought it was cheaper to there than other places we go to. We would definitely go again to try out other options.",

The hostess was extremely rude and the Manager would not take the call. This is the second time in the last three months we have gone and there were issues.  Also went a different time and the restaurant was closed when the hours in the door show it should have been opened.  They have become unreliable and miss managed. Will not be returning.",

I brought my newborn with my family and was told by the hostess that we were unable to be seated on one half of the restaurant because a bar was located on that side. I had never heard of such a rule at a regular sit down restaurant. We waited over 30 minutes and watched both large and small parties be seated ahead of us. We were finally told our table was ready on the restaurant-only side, but then the manager stepped in to say tables were not allowed to pushed together. At this point we spoke with the manager and he was unapologetic for the long unexplained wait. Bad customer service. Slippery Mermaid just lost 6 new customers. They are not a family friendly restaurant.",

    "text": "I have eaten at the Slippery Mermaid several times and dispute the fact that the sushi just glorified California Rolls, I have had a pleasant experience. However, after the way that we were treated by management tonight, I do not think we will EVER dine there again. Upon arrival, we did notice that the restaurant was slight full for a Thursday night, but with the local schools being on spring break, it was not unexpected. We were asked if we would mind sitting at the \"sushi bar\" (literally a small counter facing a wooden wall), since there \"SEEMED\" to be no other tables be available. We waited for almost 15 minutes before asking to be moved since no one had come over to take our order. One of the hostesses said it would be an hour wait despite the fact that their were tables being cleared and no one waiting to be seated. We even asked to sit at the Tiki Bar but were told they did not serve food on that side of the restaurant. Once we were finally seated at another table, our waitress quickly came and put in out order for drinks and food. She was very pleasant but could clearly tell that we were not happy with the way we had been treated thus far. We waiting over 30 minutes as sushi was run over to the Tiki Bar and served to customers who were seated after us. We finally asked our waitress to speak to the manager because we genuinely believed that we were being refused service. The manager, Kyle, then approached us on the defensive with a LOT of attitude. He rudely countered our complaints by pointing out that the menu clearly asks to allow time for the artful food to be created and even tried to blame our waitress for the bad service we were receiving. I understand that running a restaurant can be tedious, but it does not mean that your treat your customers with anything but kindness and a smile. He  offered to comp our drinks as the food would be out soon, but we were tried of waiting and being treated poorly; we just wanted to pay for our drinks and leave. As we were leaving, the table next to us also asked to speak to the manager as they had been waiting over 45 minutes for their food.  If you really want decent sushi in Sewickley, I recommend the China Palace down the street who had a legitimate sushi chef and options other than a California role with garlic aoili.",

I must say it doesn't seem too family friendly, more appropriate for a date night without kids due to the long wait for food. The service was not the best... server was nice, but everything was just super slow! If I had my kids with me... we would have had to leave before you got our food and they have pretty decent attention spans at restaurants. Best sushi in town though!!! Make sure it's an adult evening out and you have a lot of time to wait for really yummy sushi.",

The menu is quite extensive and I had a hard time deciding what to order. I loved what I ordered, and will go back to try the other selections. I also ordered the pineapple mojito and it was fantastic - a perfect blend of fruit and mint.   Our server was friendly, quick and attentive. Overall, one of the best dining experience.

They put honey on the veggie roll because they weren't sure if that was vegan or not. I felt so so awful and embarrassed asking them to remake it for me without honey...but they did so without any kind of complaint or sighs of frustration. The waitress and cook were so comforting, accommodating, and friendly. Place is 5 stars in my book. Not only that...but the decor is total DIY sheek. LOVE it!!",

    "text": "Variety & decor: round of applause to Slippery Mermaid! #letsrollafatone (genius decoration!)  Let me break down the evening for you...  Couples date night! Four of us arrived around 7:30 and since the place wasn't busy, we were able to pick our own table. The bright colors and unique decorations on the walls give a feel like you're near the beach. The attached bar has a palm tree and the outside seating attempts to mimic a beach town hot spot. It was too cold for outdoor seating so we opted for a corner table close to the kitchen...we were all very hungry...I am excited to go back during warmer weather to get the full experience! We were quickly greeted by our waitress and she explained that their wine is on tap. YES PLEASE! 3 of 4 ordered a different type of red and the 4th ordered a gin & tonic. They are BYOB but now that they have their liquor license, they charge a $30 corking fee. You read that right, $30 DOLLARS! That's a lot of bottles of wine in my book.  We ordered rolls from the gluten free menu. Spicy tuna, salmon but the most notable was the roll with toasted coconut on it!! What a delightful twist! The rolls were fresh, decently sized and the display was excellent. We didn't try the exotic rolls but let me tell you, Slippery Mermaid has superb selection if you like a modern twist on sushi.   Overall, I was very happy with our experience. I can't wait to go back during the warmer months to experience the outdoor Tiki bar! It's set up to simulate a beach front restaurant. Pittsburgh's rivers don't cut it ;)",

    "text": "Food was amazing, the service/hosts were horrible. As soon as a I walked into the door, both the hosts looked at me as if I wasn't good enough to come in. So what a great start for an awful experience.   Once I got seated by myself, it took my waitress 15 minutes to even ask what beverage I wanted. Once I sat there and had my meal, I noticed that she was quick to attend her other tables as soon as they were sat in her section.    But It wasn't even that busy, so I assume that the reason it took so long is because the waitresses (in my section) had given my table to the waitress I had today (who had 4 tables already elsewhere ) because why?  To be honest, I couldn't tell you but I tipped my waitress 20% as always.   The other girls would give that \"sour puss\" look to each other once they helped someone. Like, if you hate your job, leave !!   It's a shame, I worked in the food industry and I know what it's like to be a server, never would I ever treat someone like these girls did to me.  I'll make sure to order take out next time.   The food deserves 5 stars but the service sucks",

    "text": "Well it's been a while since I've written a review on Yelp and frankly I've been remiss for not doing so.  We moved to Pittsburgh (from San Francisco) a couple years ago and have been enjoying the emergence of the Pittsburgh food scene.  More reviews will follow - as the food experiences are good and improving in this town.  I say in this town, but sadly there are no signs of life in my neighborhood, Sewickley.  Devoid of any half-decent restaurants, we've long been resigned to having to drive to the City and the East End to get our eat on.  But we were cautiously optimistic when we learned that a new sushi joint was to open right on our doorstep in Sewickley.  The caution was well-placed. We've been to the Slippery Mermaid a couple of times now and will not be going back.  We had a half-decent lunch there a few weeks ago.  We were prepared to overlook some of the odd design choices (the crockery looks more improvised than chosen with any design concept in mind), and even the clumsy service (this is Sewickley, after all).  But we ordered take-out tonight and what we got was beyond awful.  First, my wife had to wait for about 50 minutes for a couple of standard menu items (which she phoned in way in advance).  There was hardly anyone in the restaurant, and they had to call her because they were confused over the order (which she'd placed over the web).  If this wasn't odd enough as she sat waiting for the food (long after she'd ordered it) she listened as stories unfolded about orders to Sewickley having been phoned into the Florida sister property (for goodness' sake!)  After an interminable delay the sushi was ready.  The order - though scarcely extravagant - cost $80.  This would have been expensive where the good restaurants are in Pittsburgh.  It's exorbitant in a culinary backwater like Sewickley.  We unpacked the food and found that the rice (part of the menu that we'd bought) had been omitted from the order.  Extremely irritating in and of itself.  But then there was the fish.  It looked passable - if you ignored the garnish of slices of red cabbage leaf that were browned around the edges.  The fish itself was tasteless, too cold (amazing given just how long we'd been forced to wait for the food!)  The squid and Octopus (normal favorites of ours) were tough to the point that they were too hard to eat.  And the fish was generally poorly cut.  The salmon in particular was awful - with large slices of tasteless fish - as if they'd been cut with a dessert spoon.  You have no idea how long and how desperately we've been calling for a sushi restaurant in this neighborhood.  We've found a surprisingly excellent provider up on Route 8 in Gibsonia (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/k-asian-bistro-allison-park\">yelp.com/biz/k-asian-bis...</a> in case you're interested).  But Slippery Mermaid, despite charging a big multiple of their prices, delivers both service and food that is nowhere near as good.",
