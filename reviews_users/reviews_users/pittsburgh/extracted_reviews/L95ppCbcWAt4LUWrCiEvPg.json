    "text": "I want to give this place five stars, I really, really do. But I can't. I should preface this entire review by saying that the food absolutely gets 5 stars. One of the best meals Bobby and I have had in PGH to date.  Fortunately, they have valet service but unfortunately because of construction going on downtown it's a little confusing. You have to drive past the Capital Grille and the valet is on your right. When we were here last week, there seemed to be some sort of event going on so valet service took foreeeever to get our car back for us. We've been to this location a few times and every time, despite having reservations, we end up waiting in the lobby for a good 15 minutes. This is okay, and worth it for the food, but they definitely don't get you in right away, or at least not in our experience.  Surprisingly, between the wait to get in and the amount of time our server took between ordering/retrieving our drinks, we didn't even order dinner until 9:00pm. This was sort of frustrating, considering our 8:15 reservations. I don't mind slowly enjoying a nice meal and I can dig the European trend of doing so, but at least let us put the order in and bring us some bread and our starters!  On to the meal itself:  I started with the butternut squash soup and it was amazing! Seriously one of the best (if not the best) butternut squash soup I've had, and I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to squash. Absolutely delicious and the perfect way to start a meal after coming in off the cold street.  For my entree, I had the filet with some sort of gorgonzola crust and I-kid-you-not it was one of the best cuts of steak I've ever eaten. The preparation was absolutely fantastic. It was a perfect medium rare. The flavors of the gorgonzola crust and the small bit of sauce complimented the steak without overwhelming it. I cannot say enough how delicious this meal was!  Pro tip: order the lobster mac n' cheese side. So, so, so good.  At the end of the meal, we waited for awhile for our plates to be cleared. Service was just very slow that night. We noticed that our server had a very large party, so that probably contributed to the slower service. Every other time I've been to the Capital Grille, they have wiped down the tablecloths with the crumb catchers, and offered hot towel service. These amenities were not offered this time. Perhaps because our server was so busy? Or maybe the Capital Grille simply isn't doing this anymore? Not a big deal either way, but I noticed it and so I figured it was worth mentioning.  Our server brought out dessert for us, since it was Bobby's birthday. This was lovely, but we also ordered an additional dessert (the one he really wanted!) but unfortunately, it never came out. Our server was very friendly and apologetic and certainly rectified this on the receipt, but we were just overall a bit underwhelmed with our service this time around. For such a upscale place, we hold this establishment to a higher standard.  Fortunately, the food was so delicious (as always) that I'm only deducting one star for service. It is my sincere hope that this was simply a deviation from the norm in the service here. I know we've certainly experienced better at this location! We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I came here without a reservation and was able to find a seat at the bar before the bar was too busy too order food.  If you would like to dine, then I recommend a reservation.  For appetizer, I had the Lobster Bisque soup by recommendation of the bartender Michael. He was spot on with his recommendation. The soup was excellent. I cleaned the bowl with the warm bread we were given.  With his credibility established, we ordered a few other of Michael's recommendations: the Sirloin, the Porterhouse, and the Lobster Mac'n'Cheese. The steaks were the portions which they were advertised to be. Furthermore, they were both cooked to medium-rare as we requested; however, the outside of the steak was a bit too charred in some portions which led a few bites to be a little too ashy for the cost of the steaks.  The Lobster Mac'n'Cheese was surprisingly good. It was topped off with a crunchy ingredient to complement the lobster and macaroni which gave the dish an interesting texture.  All of Michael's recommendations were spot on, and he was very friendly and attentive throughout our meal. Michael's co-bartender, Seth was also very friendly. The two also knew many of the patrons by name further demonstrating how friendly they were. The two were also quite knowledgeable of all of the drinks which were available.  If you are in Pittsburgh and looking for a steakhouse or upscale bar, then the Capital Grille would be an appropriate destination.",

    "text": "I'm a frequent flyer at this location and normally service is top notch, however, during a recent visit I made reservations for my younger sisters birthday celebration. I specified a booth when I called ahead of time for reservation as we had a small child in our party. I arrived, the hostess was cold and unwelcoming, she seemed quite overwhelmed at the time. She said i was the first to arrive in my party, and offered for me to wait or to take me to our table. I requested to be taken to the table. I then waited 15 minutes in front of the host stand, she did not offer to take my coat, or acknowledge me in any way. When the remainder of my party arrived I let her know, we waited another 10 minutes before she acknowledged us again. She, again, did not offer to take any of our coats, then proceeded to seat us at a regular table. I asked if she could take us to a booth as requested when I initially made the reservation, to which her reply was \"ummm, I dont know\" followed by an eye roll, as she quickly turned and hurried back to the host stand leaving us stand there.  They did eventually get us to a booth, quite some time after our reservation. But our entire experience was ruined at this point due to this young woman's poor attitude and the way we were treated. It was my sisters first time and she was thoroughly unimpressed. The whole situation left me outright furious. Despite the delicious food and good service from our wait staff I will not be returning to this location.",

Ordered the filet mignon and although it was a little more rare than I would have preferred, it still melted in my mouth and was overshadowed by the fact the lobster mac n cheese (minus the lobster) was perfection. One side was suitable enough for my husband and I, we ended up bringing the rest home for the most expensive leftovers we've ever had. Definitely make it a point to come here for any special occasion!",

    "text": "The whole experience was wonderful. I was a little worried when we got there because we asked to be seated somewhere else and the hostess was definitely not happy about it. When we pay good money for a meal I expect the best of service. Our waiter, Travis, was the best. Very knowledgeable and courteous. I would love to have him again when we return.  We had their speciality pineapple vodka soaked cocktail. Delicious.  We ordered two appetizers, the crab cakes and calamari with spicy peppers. Both tasted wonderful. I would suggest eating the crab cakes first because the peppers from the calamari slightly took over my palate. The bread basket they served was elegant and the butter very fresh and tasty.  Dinner was tenderloin with lobster tail with two sides of creamed corn and bacon and the roasted mushrooms. Simple, tasty, and went well with the meat.  We finished off the evening with coffee (was SO happy it was piping hot and strong) and dessert, flourless chocolate espresso cake and the coconut cream cake! Both were absolutely to die for, and a must have. Great evening.",

I received s confirmation email immediately. When we showed up right around  6:30 the hostess (talker one with long get hair) copped an attitude telling me that our reservation was for 6. I showed her the confirmation for 6:30, which she begrudgingly agreed but qualified that i \"must have changed it on the web...\".  That was a bad way to start out out celebration dinner.  I told the maitre he graciously apologized.   Maria was our very attentive server and the team supporting her was well coordinated.  Except for the rude greeter, everyone used appropriate \"Ritz Carlton\" language and backed it up with very good service.  Oh, the food, Well it was top shelf.",

    "text": "The Capital Grille is by far one of the best dining experiences I've ever had.  I have been here twice for large group luncheons and the food and the service has been impeccable both times.  The staff are attentive and gracious without being ingratiating.  I've actually not been to any other steakhouses in Pittsburgh (Ruth Chris, Mortons, Eddie Merlots) so I have nothing to compare Capital Grille against in relation to those establishments, but I do feel that even though Capital Grille is a chain that they do a great job here in Pittsburgh at putting their own unique style into this location and even though it attracts the high-end business/legal crowd during the work week, it doesn't feel intimidating because of the warm and comfortable decor.   On this occasion our group requested to order ala carte from the lunch menu and they were more than happy to accommodate us when we asked them to be sure to reserve/make available the lobster mac and cheese and the bone-in filet for our group; two items which are not typically available during lunchtime.  We started with a few orders of the pan-fried calamari to share (we had a group of 15), and for my meal I ordered a caesar salad and the bone-in filet.  Our group also shared a couple of orders the lobster mac and cheese as a side dish.  I asked for the chef's recommended temperature on the filet and ordered it with the porcini rub and it was very tender and flavorful.  The lobster mac and cheese was perfect with large chunks of sweet lobster and the perfect amount of creaminess/cheesiness!  None of our group had any complaints and we all went home with doggie bags (or dessert to go) and happy bellies!    I would love to go to Capital Grille again for a more intimate dining experience with a smaller group of people, but I am looking forward to the next time that our bosses decide to take our group out to lunch there again!",

    "text": "Review Number 600 - I decided to take BJ out for a really special dinner on Father's Day.  He likes steak and seafood, so Capital Grille came to mind.  I made a reservation through open table.  When we arrived, the restaurant was very busy, but we were seated right away.  The decor is rich dark wood walls, extraordinary light fixtures, rich woven wool carpeting, and a few mounted animal heads and statues and old world type of artwork.  I am sure you get the picture.  For drinks, BJ opted for his usual beer and I had a Cosmo.  We had plenty of time to study the menu.  We decided to skip the appetizers and ordered a C.G. Chopped Salad to share.  I would call this a kitchen sink salad, it was full of a lot of different fresh vegetables, served on mixed greens with house made croutons and olive vinaigrette.  I really liked the salad, very fresh and delicious.  The bread basket here is great, it offers some nice choices of bread.    For our steaks, I got a filet mignon.  BJ got the seared tenderloins with butter poached lobster tails.  We decided to share the grilled asparagus based on our server's recommendation.  BJ loved his meal and that's what was important on this particular occasion.  He shared his lobster with me and it was perfectly cooked.  My steak, however was over cooked, tough and very dry.  It's a sin to see a filet prepared this way.  Also, our server seemed to be lost and didn't return to see if our steaks were cooked properly until well after BJ was done.  At that point, I wasn't really interested in a new steak.  But, as a reward for my suffering through a mediocre steak, we were given a free dessert.  Not exactly adequate, if you ask me, but better than nothing.  We got the cheesecake with seasonal berries.  It's described as the lighter, fluffier cousins of a New York.  Our server said it made with mascarpone and had a little crisp caramelized sugar ala creme brulee style, which was a nice touch.  The berries were raspberries, strawberries, blueberries and blackberries.  It was delicious.  We did have a really nice evening out.  But it's a shame that it couldn't have been perfect.  Inadequate service and a shoe leather steak prevented that.  We might try C.G., again.  But we have had such perfect meals at Morton's and Ruth Chris', we should probably stick with them.",

I didn't like the au gratin potatoes and my date didn't enjoy his scallops.

The lighting and decor make for a very pleasing atmosphere. Also, the waitstaff are very pleasant and hospitable.  The downside of this restaurant is that the food is very overpriced considering the portions. I ordered the salmon ($35.00) which was served with a side of green beans. I asked if I also could have a side order of rice. I was given two scoups of sticky white rice and charged $6.00 extra.   The salmon itself was good, but the serving was much TOO SMALL for a $35.00 charge.  When I left the restaurant, I was still hungry. My food bill total for the entree, soft drink and tip was $50.00+.  Bottom line: Not worth the money. If I'm going to spend $50.00 on a meal, the plate should be filled.",

I was just very impressed with the whole experience from beginning to end.  Trying to stay on the healthy side, I was a little nervous about going to a steak house.  Don't get me wrong, I love me some filet mignon.  And maybe another time, some filet will be had... But for now I had to stay on the safe side.    The soup of the day was lobster bisque.  Darnnit! I love lobster bisque!  That was a hard one to avoid.  So... I ordered that and kept the rest of the meal light.  The lobster bisque was awesome!  A tomato base with a HUGE piece of lobster in the bottom.  NICE surprise!  For the main course I ordered the scallops in lemon sauce instead of butter and sauteed greens.  It was a fantastic choice because it tasted yummy and was on the healthy side.  The scallops were a great size, seared and cooked perfectly, with a light lemon sauce.  The greens were also served in the lemon sauce, which made them equally as delicious and flavorful.    I had one tiny tiny bite of their creme brulee cheese cake and it was to. Die. For!  Seriously, if you're going for dessert, any choice is probably going to be a good one considering the choices I heard that day!    I must say again, the service was stellar.  From start to finish everything was taken care of.  The servers were extremely friendly too, and seriously seemed like they enjoyed their job and the food there.    So if you're looking for a fancy schmancy night out with stellar service and food, this is your place!",

It's vodka that has been siting in pineapples for a week. Great drink for ladies and men and it will make you a bit tipsy lol. For food I ordered the tenderloin with lobster tail and my boyfriend ordered the 16oz bone in filet. For sides we had the gratin potatoes and the mushrooms. All amazing picks especially the gratin potatoes. The only thing I didn't like that much was my steak. It was suppose to be medium and they gave me medium well. It had slight char taste which I hate so i just loaded A1 sauce and it made it better. I didn't feel like sending it back, it wasn't that big of a deal to me. Would I come back definitely.

That aside, lovely ambiance, a professional and courteous staff, delicious food that not only didn't disappoint, but went above and beyond my expectations. I'll make a very minor complaint and note that there was a bit of banging noise by where I was seated, probably coming from the kitchen-- it wasn't terribly loud so it didn't bother me much, though it was fairly consistent throughout the meal. Other than that bit of nitpicking, though... I can't think of a reason I wouldn't return.",

    "text": "The last two times I have dined at Capital Grille's Pittsburgh location I have been rather disappointed with my meal, and this past time, not only was my meal horrible but the service was inexcusable especially at this price point. We came for a birthday celebration and it also happened to be restaurant week. Receiving our waters was by far the fastest and friendliest service of the night, mind you this person was not our server. our actual server eventually brought out our bottle of wine, a Malbec, which was enjoyed by all.   All five of us ended up ordering the RW menu. The appetizer choices were: clam chowder, wedge with blue cheese and bacon, or Caesar salad. The Caesar salad was my choice and, unfortunately besides dessert, was the highlight of the meal. Oh, and the Asiago/onion bread. Those two items tied for second best of the night. For entrees, I chose the 8 oz. filet medium rare. Others in my party chose the krona crusted ribeye for an extra $10. Our server did not deliver our food or check on us at any point. Upon cutting my steak, it was rare, not medium rare, and our server was nowhere to be found. My boyfriend ended up stopping another server requesting my steak be returned for extra cooking. Well, when it was brought back out, it was the same exact steak(at this price point I should be given a new one) and it was completely black and charred on the outside yet hardly cooked any better on the inside. Frankly, it was the worst steak I've ever had and was absolutely disgusting. The \"chef\" did bring out new accompaniments- mashed potatoes, which were ok, and green beans, which were flavorless and near raw. Not once did the server stop by and ask if everything was better nor did he ask how anyone else was doing. The server disappeared again for quite sometime and eventually cleared our plates after making multiple passes by us to visit other tables. Dessert- a flourless espresso cake with blackberry sauce- was the best item of the night, though hardly made up for the terrible entree. The fastest service from our server was when he whisked by to pick up the check presenter with credit card (again not a word said as he did so) and return it after it was processed. They did give the birthday boy a nice dessert- cheesecake plus the flourless espresso cake- but, again, does not make up for the service and terrible filet. I'd implore management to retrain this particular server as other tables around us seemed to be receiving smiling service that was at least semi attentive. Since this is the second time I have had a negative experience on some level here, I can say I will not return to this location in the future.",

Where they fell short was in the wait staff.    Usually we get the same waitress, or someone we know like Margie, we should have asked for her, our bad.   We got someone else this time, I will not publicly say who it was , we aired our grievances last night with the manager and I hope they do something about it, like additional training.  This in no way will deter us from not coming back, however we will consider one of the other 4 steak joints in Pittsburgh first.  Hyde Park, Ruth Chris, Eddie Merlot, Mortons.",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of this place! I've had the chance to eat dinner here as well as eat off-menu light bites when organizations I'm a member of have booked lunch here. I've also had the chance to enjoy a quick tour of their wine stocks, which honestly are impressive in and of themselves! Not only did I get a glimpse into the huge collection of wine but I found out that they have quite a system here to ensure that different wines are ready for serving throughout the night. So yep, when it comes to wine it's safe to say that these guys definitely know what they're doing.  Food wise, I can say after dining here during group outings that Capital Grille makes very delicious and tender meat dishes. I've had off-menu lamb bites and kabobs and can't even describe how tasty they were! The last time I was here for dinner I opted to stick to soup and salad, and believe it or not those options were just as satisfying as anything else I could have ordered. The bisque was thick and nicely seasoned, and the Caprese Salad was put together beautifully and drizzled with just the right amount of dressing - and hey, I love any place that doesn't drown its salads in dressing! And to finish my last meal off, I ordered the cheesecake with fresh seasonal berries. It was definitely one the best pieces of cheesecake that I've ever had, I think - it was both tasty and light and fluffy, so I left after eating feeling perfectly full rather than overstuffed from my delightful meal.  Service? No complaints. I've never had a problem here. The waiters here are always able to answer questions and help with meal and drink selections when we're having trouble picking what to pair with what. They've also always been quick to check on our waters, take away empty dishes, see if we need anything else - honestly they've always succeeded in making me feel like a special guest, which in a place as fancy and expensive as Capital Grille is always a good thing, I think!  I would absolutely come back for a big date or just to grab a drink and dessert, but unfortunately Capital Grille will always be a special occasion only sort of place. It's impossible to forget that the food here is expensive - particularly the steaks! - and while I don't mind paying for a high quality meal like the ones you can get here once in a while, those prices do mean that this place and my budget don't always mix well. Darn money, always ruining my fun!",

Capital Grille was one of the only restaurants that did not have over an hour wait.  We were seated quick enough, the waitress, who was working on 13 hours was very pleasant.  Unfortunately it took an hour for us to get our main course.  This was also at 9:30 at night.  My wife ordered a filet well done, it was (at best) medium rare.  I ordered mine rare, which it was,  but the entire outside was charred and tasted it.  They took them back, and I'm pretty sure microwaved my wife's to well done and made a new steak for me.  My wife was satisfied with hers, but mine still lacked any flavor, and for a $50 dry aged strip steak, I couldn't believe it.    I am NOT a steak snob by any means, but I've had better steak from Kroger seasoned with just a little salt and pepper.     I will say though that the waitress was amazing, the manager was very apologetic and kind as well.  They ended up comping the entire meal and gave us a desert as well, but we left hungry.  Again, they seemed to be having problems this night altogether.  I can only assume they had a new chef/cooking staff.",

The sides, mashed potatoes and creamed spinach were warm at best, when delivered to table and cold midway through meal.  Service was spotty from the location of our table, right on the corner of a busy pass through lane into the larger dining room.  Waiter disappeared for long stretches at a time.  Ordered a drink and thought I would have to go mix it myself.  After our main course he disappeared again and didn't ask if we wanted after dinner drinks/coffee.    We also got the vibe that they could care less about our business.  Indifferent service always gets me steamed.  Maybe an off night or maybe this is how they operate at this location.  I pass through Pittsburgh once or twice per year on business but probably won't be back to this location for a business dinner.",

(Thanks to the FREE Open Table Android App)   Our server Melissa S was great! We told her that we were celebrating a late Valentine's Day and she brought us each a complimentary Champagne Toast. We both had the Adults Only Arnold Palmer as our cocktails. The bread basket featured some really tasty bread to hold us over until our salads came out.   We shared a delicious blue cheese and bacon wedge salad. The Applewood smoked bacon really made the salad. I just wish it had a little more blue cheese in the dressing.   The wife had the Dry Aged Steak au Poivre (Tender sirloin flavored with black peppercorn) with a side of creamed spinach and I had the Dry Aged Porterhouse with a side Lobster Mac & Cheese. They were both superb! My Porterhouse was cooked perfectly and was extremely tender and juicy. The mac & cheese was delicious and had a good bit of Lobster as well. We both shared the mac & cheese and creamed spinach. The creamed spinach is blended with a bechamel sauce which is good but, a little too salty for my taste.  For dessert we had the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake. So good.  The place was pretty packed our entire evening there but, our service never suffered. Our glasses were always full and when finished our plates were also whisked away quickly and without any fuss. Even the valet guys are nice. I'm having my yummy leftovers for lunch as we speak.

Most likely they were catering to the usual customer base of downtown employees in addition to those like us. The interior itself felt like a museum with all the paintings on the walls and the stuffed animal heads (the latter was probably not necessary). One annoying thing was the slow speed at which we were attended to--we had to wait quite a bit before getting our waters, before getting our orders taken, the bread coming out, and then finally each of the fixed courses.   The bread and clam chowder first course were fine--pretty tasty, nothing to write home about. The second course got interesting. We each ordered a dry aged sirloin, which came with a good salad on the side. The steak was actually done wonderfully, super tender and finely spiced around. But the problem was that both of ours came out rare when we ordered medium-rare! Even our waiter acknowledged this, although by the time he came back around we waited so long that we were pretty much finished with our meal. It wasn't the biggest problem in the world, but our waiter acknowledged the mixup and compensated our meal. So that was nice, and the desserts were good too. So while I probably wouldn't go back on a normal occasion, it sure was an interesting experience.",

I normally prefer to sit in the bar/lounge area, but most recently had dinner in the dining room, which turned out to be a better choice bc the bar was PACKED. Our server, Matt, was great- the service was intuitive and playful. He recommended and accommodated as needed. Everything is always delicious, obviously steak is their specialty.... but another highlight is the lobster mac n cheese, its amazing! Also, try the Stoli Doli cocktail, it's their signature. But go easy, it's stronger than it tastes!   All in all, It's a high end chain steakhouse, right, and in a city filled with so many unique & independent places you might not think of Capital, however, it's predictably excellent and you won't be disappointed.",

The service was subpar at best.  After being seated, we waited for a good 5-10 minutes before being greeted.  Our table was partially set, and we needed to ask for napkins halfway through our first course. Our waitress was far from attentive, and it was obvious she did not want to be working.  After mildly checking from across the way on how our dinner was, she quickly rushed to take our dessert order and our bill was on the table before dessert even came out. While we can usually overlook bad service for good food, there wasn't much to be desired when it came to taste and presentation.  We both ordered a Caesar salad, which I've seen plated more appealingly at you local pub.  At $10 a salad, I guess we just expected to see more than a plate half scattered with lettuce and 2 croutons. My fiance had a steak, which he did say was delicious, and we split a nice batch of their truffle fries.  I got their vegetarian pasta, it was ok - lacked flavor, but I recognized it was a steak house and pasta isn't a speciality. Maybe it was an off night for the kitchen and staff - regardless - we won't be rushing back or recommending it to anyone.",

From looking around the dining room, it's apparent this Pittsburgh location draws many business professionals after work.  Service was top notch.... some of the best I've ever received. Our waiter, Greg, was personable, knowledgeable, and very accommodating. I inquired about 2 of the reds on the wine list and he described them and then brought me samples to help me decide. My husband tried the Stoli Doli signature drink and enjoyed that too.  Greg was also very well versed in the menu items and offered suggestions (fyi - they were aged steaks, Kona steak, Porcini steak, lobster mac & cheese, truffle fries, Stoli Doli drink).  I mentioned that I wasn't too hungry and thought I'd get something small and different from my husband's choice so we could share. He offered to split our meals on each plate, so we ended up with a Surf and Turf meal. In addition lobster mac 'n cheese side dish is to die for and includes giant pieces of lobster...   One last tip - free Valet parking at the door!! Make this your first stop in the city and return for your car later. Tip the valet generously and you still make out well.  A wonderful meal from start to finish! No doubt we'll be returning to try more of the menu items, next time from their new location (currently under construction) across from the King of Prussia Mall.",

    "text": "Overall GrubGrade C  Atmosphere:  Grade B+:  From the outside and inside, it appeared like we were going to have a dining experience at The Capital Grille that was well worth the wait and anticipation.  The decor on the inside was contemporary and clean, and the muted lighting and music created a really nice atmosphere.  The Capital Grille appears like it would be a nice place to take a date or celebrate an anniversary.  We had called for reservations, and the earliest we could get was 8:15pm Saturday evening.  We arrived at around 8:10pm and the place was pretty hopping.  We checked in with the hostess to find out that there would be a wait for our table, so we nabbed a table in the bar area, and buckled in for our long trip into disappointment.  Service:  Grade C-:  So, when we tweet this review out, if someone from The Capital Grille happens to read it, let us offer this piece of friendly advice:  look up the word \"reservation\" in the dictionary.  We thought we were in some bizzaro episode of Seinfeld when we told the hostess we had a reservation and they told us we'd have to wait for a table to open up.  You see, that's what the reservation was for.  There should have been a table set aside for us.  If we wanted to wait, we would have skipped the reservation.  That was completely ridiculous.  Oh, we can see giving our table to someone who is waiting if we arrived late, but we're awesome and that's why we got there at least 5 minutes early.  We waited at a cramped little table by the bar, and we were  1/2 hour into our meal before the hostess came to take us to our table (which, by the way, we had asked our server to cancel - oops).  That means our table wasn't ready until 8:45pm.  I can promise you, had we not already started our meal at our little cramped bar table, I would have verbally eviscerated the hostess staff.  That behavior is completely unacceptable for an upscale restaurant.  We elected to stay at our little bar table because the server we started with did such a pleasant job in getting our meal started and recommending our first drinks.  However, after the first round, we got a new server, who we'll just call C.  Service stayed pretty good for a few more minutes until C got another couple of tables seated in his section, then it completely fell apart.  There were really lengthy waits between courses and it took forever to get a drink refill.  Requests had to be repeated on a couple of occasions.  This type of service wouldn't be acceptable at Applebees, and we certainly shouldn't be paying a premium price for this level of service.  This grade would have been \"F\" except for the service during the first 10 minutes.  Food/Spirits:  Grade C+:  With respect to food, there were some really nice things that The Capital Grille did well.  Katina stated with a drink called The Bohemian, which had a raspberry and peach flavor to it.  There was definitely more emphasis on the raspberry than the peach, but the drink was really tasty.  I started with a Stoli Doli, which was a drink make with chilled, pineapple infused Stoli.  It was smooth with the perfect amount of pineapple.  Katina ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese, which is technically a side dish.  So she supplemented with a crock of French Onion Soup.  Our server warned her that the portion size on the crock was pretty large, when elaborated by using his hands to pantomime a crock that is pretty much the exact same size as every other crock of French Onion Soup she's had.  What came out, however, was this massive bowl of soup.  Flavor-wise, Katina says it was good but not the best French Onion Soup she's had.  As for the Lobster Mac and Cheese, we were skeptical since our server really talked it up like it was the cat's pajamas.  You see, Katina's had the Lobster Mac and Cheese at Eddie Merlot's, and if their Lobster Mac and Cheese is a Mercedes, then the Lobster Mac and Cheese at The Capital Grille was a Yugo.  The cheese sauce was too runny and there were only a few large chunks of lobster in the dish.  This same dish could have been pulled off with a little bit of lobster and a box of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese.  It's not even in the same ball park as the Mac and Cheese at Eddie Merlot's.  I ordered the Rib Lamb Chops with the porcini rub.  The taste was a little overwhelming at first, but after the first few bites I really started to enjoy them.  Overall, it was pretty good performance on the lamb, but for $46, the word \"pretty\" should not be in the description.  We also tried the Adults Only Arnold Palmer, which tasted like watered down iced tea, and the Mojito de Uvas.  I ordered two of these mojitos, because the addition of the green grapes made this the best mojito I've had - just the right amount of sweetness with no alcohol bite.  So, I had to order a second one, which was just a glass of ice with two swallows of mojito in it.  The difference between the two is inexplicable.  And, at $13 per drink, shafting me with a large",

I got the wedge salad, steak with arugula salad, and chocolate cake special. It was amazing. I usually don't like wedge salads  (I think they are lazy...why are you making me do the work, just cut up my salad...)  but this one was delicious. The bacon on it was awesome and the dressing was freshly made. The steak was done exactly how I asked for it, and it was one of the best steaks I have ever had. The chocolate cake was gluten free and was really decadent, rich, and smooth almost like fudge. I could have used more whipped cream and raspberry sauce, but overall it was delicious. I will definitely go back!!!",

My wife had a bone-in filet that she hasn't stopped talking about a day later.  Frankly, not a place we could afford to go to often. But for a special occasion, I can think of no better place.",

I don't eat beef so today I had the sushi-grade tuna for lunch today, and it was amazing, an enormous piece perfectly seared on the outside and rare on the inside. The flour-less chocolate cake was to die for. They even made a plain chicken breast for my toddler, and it was better than any plain chicken  breast I've ever tasted.  The service was impeccable as expected.  There are better steakhouses in the world, but this one will likely not disappoint for an good fine dining experience in Pittsburgh.",

The capital grille was incredibly friendly, and has some nice \"small town touches\" like a massive oil painting of our own Mr. Rogers hanging on the wall.  The lighting, booths and tables are luxurious but cozy, and they manage to be both warm and elegant.  Their wine selection seems to go on forever, they looked to have well over 1000 bottles in their temperature controlled wine cellar, on hand ready for you to drink!  The staff was friendly and genuinely passionate about the quality of their food and drink.  The food was excellent and can be compared to Mortons or Ruths Chris, but Capital Grille beat them out with the warmest, most inviting atmosphere of any of the luxury steak houses I've had the pleasure of eating at.",

Our waiter was excellent with recommendations, honest about some menu choices, and extremely attentive and personal.  This is a fantastic spot for a special occasion.  I ate at the Capital Grille in Indianapolis (see that review here: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-capital-grille-indianapolis#hrid:z4sbFRVo63w9b03-VEvxOg\">yelp.com/biz/the-capital...</a>) the night I got engaged and they did many special things for us.  At my recent experience at the Pittsburgh location, I watched the same personal treatment unfold at a nearby table for a young couple's anniversary.  I recommend the lobster mac n cheese as a side along with the wedge salad and Delmonico cut steak.  You can have any preparation on any steak, so just ask.  You will get plenty of food and be full, so order wisely to avoid wasting money (though this stuff makes for some delicious leftovers).  The Strawberries Capital Grille is ok, but the mixed berries with cream is better.  Valet parking is complimentary.",

    "text": "I've had better.   I expect many people to rate this place on expectations and not really relative quality because they feel that they are supposed to. I don't. So, for starters this place looks high class. The prices on the menu reflect that appearance too. I think it would be a challenge to get out a lunch under $25 and be full afterwards. I ordered a dry-aged sirloin steak ($24) and \"The wedge\" salad ($9). I had never had a dry-aged sirloin steak before, but according to the waiter it is supposed to have more flavor. Honestly, it just tasted like any other steak that I've had. I probably could have made a comparable steak after shopping at the local grocery store. Like really, all you do is cook it. But I digress. The salad was tasty but it was iceberg lettuce and the sauce was likely loaded with fat. Overall not a bad experience.  But I recommend the Ruth Chris Steak house instead of this place as they add a light sauce (with garlic butter) to their steak that really adds to the flavor. They also kiss your ass throughout the entire meal which makes you feel like a king. Hail!  Food Quality/Taste = 3 Stars Portion Size Given Price = 2 Stars Relative Price = 2 Stars Service = 4 Stars Experience with Staff = 4 Stars Decor = 5 Stars Clean (yes/no) = yes",

We went on a weeknight and set reservations as recommended by the front desk when I called. The service was attentive with the staff not hovering despite the crowd. When our server  T arrived, we mentioned that we were celebrating and wanted to have a leisurely meal and she absolutely delivered. We asked to see the Restaurant week menu along with the standard menu (with the HUGE wine menu). Our questions were met with careful consideration and suggestions for options were all great.  We both had the  RW specials with Caesar Salads,  Filets topped with Grilled Shrimp, shared sides of green beans, mashed potatoes and the FABULOUS Lobster Mac n Cheese. Salad was excellent but could have had a few more croutons. The steaks were exactly as ordered and were delivered in a very tasty au jus. The shrimp were much more than we expected both in quantity, size and flavor. My wife is not much of a potato eater but had a second helping of the mashed, especially the skins. The best surprise was the Lobster Mac n Cheese with lots of lobster, thick, rich, creamy sauce that invited us to eat more and more. Very decadent. Great comfort food.  Highly recommend it. Dessert was also included in the fixed meal and server T suggested the choices might narrow as the evening went on so we were kept up on what was available as the meal progressed. We both opted for the cheesecake, but due to allergies omitted the berries/sauce. It arrived with a creme brulee topping with a light fluffy center and a firm homemade crust . The portion was just enough to top off a delightful meal ( we took leftovers of everything and are enjoying it again tonight)  Decor was very men's club and a little over the top, but warm. All in all the dinner and entire experience was memorable. Our server stuck around to chat when possible and was very personable, and is definitely an asset to the Grille.  We will definitely return and hope to try other dishes , but would be glad to request the same server as she was that good.  Thanks for making our anniversary even more special...",

We aren't from Pittsburgh but I heard about Capital Grille from clients so we left and headed straight there. They saved our night! We were able to be seated immediately on a Friday night without reservations and our service and experience was beyond perfection. Our waiter Christopher was already going above and beyond before even finding out about our nightmare experience just minutes prior and then once he found out it was our One year anniversary he created a memorable experience for us. He did not hold back. He wanted to save our night and he did in a big way. I'm truly grateful for his service and everyone else that helped serve us in anyway that night! The food was delicious and the cheesecake was the best I've ever had! Thank you Christopher & Capital Grille",

My favorite thing that I ate had to be the potatoes. They were creamy yet still had some skins in them. I could have ate the entire bowl myself.

We ate at the bar, which was quite nice.  Had the Calamari appetizer, which was quite good.  Calamari was fresh, and it was very tasty overall (served with jalapeno peppers).  Later sampled the Crabcake appetizer, which was very nice as well.  The bread selection was excellent.  Went with the 10 oz filet, which was perfectly cooked (Medium +), butterflied, and extra blackened.  While I would have preferred a bit more seasoning, it was a perfect cut of meat, again - perfectly cooked.  Exceeded my expectation.  Had the Lobster-Mac, which was decent, but a little underwhelming.  We have had similar Mac dishes elsewhere, and have been more impressed (Truluck in Florida and Birches in Baltimore).  Also tried the Filet Oscar, and was not nearly as impressed.  Felt it wasn't cooked properly (also Medium +, but not butterflied, which may have accounted for this difference).  Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. Had the filet been seasoned a bit more, I might have gone with 5 stars.",

Decadent array of selections ranging from land to sea. The seafood platter was perfectly chilled with seasonings to delight your palette. The wine menu had many choices from different regions that allowed pairing from afar to local blends. The chef selection of bone in rib eye was perfectly cooked to medium and the lamb was so tasty that there was no gamy flavoring in them. The dessert menu was to die for! I'd pick the double chocolate cake.   Our waitress Katie provided great service with proper etiquette which holds high stars in my book with the use of proper verbiage of please and thank you's!   Highly recommended!!!!",

The Stoli Doli drink they are known for is delicious. But the service was poor. That's why I have to give 3 stars. There were 3 of us. The bill was $350. I never complain about the cost of great meals and I've eaten in the best restaurants around the world. But when food is this expensive, the service must be in alignment with the cost of the food. We were finished eating for 15 minutes before our waitress appeared. Then when she did appear, we asked for the check so we wouldn't have to wait longer to get the bill.   I think they need to step up their game since Eddie V's is just a few blocks up the street.   The picture is of the steak tartare appetizer.",

Our server was Maria who was super engaging, attentive, knowledgeable and most importantly genuine. I really hope other high end restaurants learn this take on service. The entire staff was helpful, especially as I was looking around for the restroom another server asked if she could walk me to it. Our food was great and I didn't expect anything less considering the clientele. We had the calamari which was breaded perfectly. I had the filet my boyfriend had one of the mushroom rub strip steaks. Both cooked perfect and melted in your mouth.   Overall loved the entire evening and we cannot wait to come back. Keep it up! P.s. ask for Maria!",

The food at the capital grill is well worth the price.   I ordered the balsamic wagyu burger. It was heavenly. I decided to have it served medium and this was the perfect choice.  It was so savory and juicy. I also elected to have the truffle oil fries. OH MY GOD. I think they were the best fries I've ever had in my entire life. For dessert, I ordered the cheesecake. The cook fired the top to give it a small crunch. I'm not a huge dessert fan, so I don't think I really appreciated the time it took to create such a beautiful dish, so I'll include a photograph.   I don't think I've ever been in a restaurant that has made me want to come back the very next day, so props to the capital grill!",

    "text": "I'm not new to the slightly higher price point, chain steak house circuit.  If Ruth's Chris had a rewards program, my family would have free steak for life.  That being said, I know what is expected here.  It's going to be stuffy and overpriced; you know that.  But your expectation is the food and service should make up for those little trips.  +1 and I are early 20s, cute lil' professional guys.  I understand we are a contrast to the older people in floor length furs, but we didn't come in off the street like a bunch of ruffians demanding cheese fries (although the ladies behind the host podium would have disagreed).  After being greeted with \"do you have a reservation\", we let them know we were early and would have a drink at the bar until our scheduled time was up.  Drinks were fine. Whatever.  We were taken to our table which was one of two placed right in front of the kitchen and that terrifying eagle.  They're kind of like the next to the bathroom booths.  When I asked our hostess if we could move to one of the few (3+) open tables that were actually in the dining room, she said she couldn't do that (I would normally freak out over this, but somehow that pales to the rest of the night).  Our waiters and helpers/runners were awesome.  They weren't nearly as personable as you'd expect, but they didn't act like we were confused and didn't mean to be there.  Now here, judging by the other reviews, I should rave about the food.  That is absolutely not going to happen.  This is also going to be much more harsh than it should be as I was expecting (what I suppose is) way too much.  Way harsh, T. Oops.  Because I don't do seafood, we ordered the fries \"to share\" .. The portion you receive of the truffle fries is sad.  If Burgatory's truffle fries are a 10, these may get a 4.  We both ordered our double priced Caesar salads and were given small plates of yellow iceberg.  I can't tell you how sad this was.  A few shavings of asiago I was able to find saved my sanity that night. For our main courses, I ordered the chicken that makes more an hour than I do, and +1 got the strip steak.  He said it was \"good,\" but was not impressed in the slightest.  My chicken tasted like I did nothing but threw a chicken in the oven and then cut it in half and served it to you with some blackened cooked shriveling yellow carrots.  It was sad.  So sad we didn't even get dessert.  I just wanted to get out of there.  The only decent sustenance I received was 200% marked up glass of Riesling.  If you are thinking of going here, it won't be the worst.  Clearly, people enjoy it.  But if you are one of those people that may have expectations for anything ever or don't happen to have some extra change from your hedge fund to waste, keep walking until you hit Ruth's Chris or something that isn't going to make you cry into your fifty dollar piece of meat (at least that would season it).",

I almost got locked up after an incident at the Carnegie Museum of Art when an overzealous guard tried to confiscate my elderly mother's backpack (purse). It was a Pyrrhic victory as I was still shaking with rage when I arrived here for dinner... But the SS Irma couldn't have docked at a friendlier port!!! I am a huge fan of the Capital Grille in Boca so this was like coming home! It felt like a parallel universe as this place was also loaded with snooty oil paintings, dead animals and gorgeous chandaliers (just like the one I love at home). Absent were the obsequious servers I have known for years and instead I was treated to a more urbane dining experience! My waitress was very friendly but I wasn't treated like a nineteenth century Victorian, in colonial India, like I usually am at the one in Boca... It was actually quite refreshing!!! A member of our group was suffering from the effects of exotic room service (which we've been subsisting on at the Fairmont) and we had to leave early but this hardly fazed our hosts! They wrapped up our delicious food (some of which was way off menu) and sent us happily on our way... Anyone who turns their nose up at this fine city and its excellent restaurants is a fool!! This Capital Grille is just as good as the one in Boca and I highly recommend it to any and all!",

    "text": "My family and I visited for lunch during Pittsburgh Restaurant Week.   Our reservation was confirmed through the OpenTable app, and we were politely greeted and promptly seated upon arrival.  Although there was quite a difference in the restaurant week pricing versus the actual menu prices, service and quality were not compromised.    Unfortunately, the field greens and tomato salad listed on the restaurant week website had been changed to a wedge salad at the restaurant.  Since I don't eat pork or like blue cheese, I opted for the only other selection of clam chowder.  I never eat clam chowder (personal preference) but I was actually pleased with the taste and consistency.  For the entree course, we all ordered the dry aged sirloin with roasted pepper, fresh mozzarella, and arugula salad - wow!  My one complaint is that my steak was a bit underdone, but I switched with my brother who didn't mind a more rare steak.  The steak was a quality cut of beef, and the side dish was the perfect accompaniment.  For dessert, we all opted for the creme brulee with fresh berries.  This dessert selection was another deviation from the online menu, but a pleasant surprise since it was absolutely delicious.  I've visited other Pittsburgh steakhouses that boast the same quality and service as The Capital Grille, but none can compare to this experience.  My parents didn't stop talking about this meal for weeks, and even tried to replicate it at home.  Thank you for a great experience!  P.S.- I've already booked a reservation for my parent's upcoming anniversary.",

Service quality is great but expect long wait times during the popular lunch and dinner hours.  Although I've heard great things, as a vegetarian diner, I was not overly impressed. They offer two off-menu vegetarian dishes: pasta with tofu/veggies or a rice dish with tofu/veggies. You get to select the vegetables and how your tofu is prepared. It was disappointingly bland and dry. The rice must've been sitting out for a while because it was crunchy by the time I got it. I had to ask for a sauce to drench over the tofu to add some flavor. It was like biting into styrofoam. The truffle fries saved the meal because they were delicious. Although they didn't have a house aioli, our server whipped up one last minute and it needed up tasting fantastic. We ended with ice cream for dessert that our server loaded up with berries, chocolate syrup and whipped cream - plus it was on the house for their Valentines' Day special. Everything tastes better if it's free.",

Our server Amber was wonderful. We mentioned that we were there for a late valentines dinner and at the end of our meal she brought out 2 complimentary desserts! Cheesecake and chocolate espresso cake, omg they were to die for and the perfect size. She also gave me a rose for valentines as well, which was super sweet.

The plan was to splurge a bit anyway since we were dining to celebrate my birthday. I had the Kona crusted NY Strip, mashed potatoes, and Lobster Bisque. I also ordered the garlic shrimp as an appetizer. The steak was perfectly prepared and pretty much melted in my mouth. Above all else Capital Grill takes a tremendous amount of pride in their steaks.   The mashed potatoes were excellently seasoned and had some skin mixed in for a nice contrast.  The lobster bisque was smooth, creamy and included a nice amount of lobster meat. I usually don't prefer lobster bisque but this was a very nice change of pace. The shrimp took the cake (what can I say, I love shrimp). They were huge and very filling. Only caveat is the garlic could have been more pronounced. I would suggest mincing as opposed to cloves. All in all it was an excellent meal. Can't go wrong.",

Everything from the wait staff to the food was excellent.  I got the 10 oz filet and it was good but I honestly enjoyed some of the other items I ordered more.  The white cheddar potato soup was such a comfort like soup.  I wish I could have that allllll the time.  We also got the Brussels sprouts as a side and they were outstanding.  It is pricey for the average person so there is no way I could afford to go often but for the \"special occasions\" I will return for sure.",

I started with the French Onion Soup and then had the Shrimp and Grits as my entree.  I finished the meal with the Creme Brulee Cheesecake.  The French Onion Soup was tasty - nothing really remarkable to say.  I was pretty disappointed with my entree.  The shrimp were overcooked, rubbery and unable to be sliced with a fork.  The sauce that was over the dish was very thin, thus watering down the grits.  The dish was the consistency of soup.  The dessert was the best part of the meal.  The cheesecake was made with ricotta cheese and wasn't overly sweet.  Our server was helpful and attentive.  I was just rather unimpressed.",

For $16, you get a three course meal.    I thoroughly enjoyed my meal which consisted of a wedge salad, a sirloin, and a flourless chocolate espresso cake. Honestly, no complaints with the meal whatsoever. The salad was...well it's salad. The sirloin was well-seasoned and cooked exactly as ordered. And the cake was amazing, which I must say, the name is a little misleading. It's more like a cream or a fudge than a cake. However, was it the best meal I've had? I've had better. I feel that to get the best out of The Capital Grille, I would need to order the filet at dinner time.   I would definitely come back here again but I will probably wait for Restaurant Week to avoid paying full price. Yes, I am that cheap! Otherwise, the food is good and the dining experience here is nice!",

The ambiance is very classy, romantic and they really pay attention to detail. To celebrate a birthday they put birthday themed confetti on the table. The drink menu and wine list was on an iPad. It was easy to navigate even if you are not tech savvy. I had the Stoli Doli a pineapple martini and it was good. The bread was delicious. I loved the lobster bisque it had a nice big chunk of lobster in it. I had the pan seared scallops with lobster mac which were phenomenal. The service was outstanding. They really impressed me. It was a fine dining experience and I would certainly go back. There are several menu items I want to try.",

On our way out, we realized that all the mothers that were there got flowers, but myself and another woman did not. This was very discouraging for me, and it is a shame to make it a social issue, but it seemed like the only few people who were excluded were racially diverse. I even spoke to an employee after leaving the restaurant to confirm if flowers were supposed to be given to everyone and he did say it was supposed to be given to all mothers. Although the food and drinks were great, the service was very unsatisfactory unfortunately. For as much money you put in, you expect good hospitality in return.",

Similar in atmosphere and menu to Morton's, the Capital Grille is located on the ground floor of the former Lazarus building at the corner of Wood & Fifth.  Expect dark paneled wood, a massively overpriced (300% and up) wine list, and oil paintings of Pittsburgh's forefathers (including Mr. Rogers).  The little things, like impeccable service by the bartenders, and umbrellas to your car on rainy nights by the valet staff, are refereshing.   Regarding the food - appetizers were just ok. I'd give a big thumbs up to the any of the dry aged steaks (simple and delicious and the house speciality) and a thumbs down to the Filet Oscar (Filet Mignon topped with lump crabmeat and a bearnaise sauce).  Also, please do yourself a favor and order the truffle fries (if you like truffles) - these are to die for. Desserts are nothing special - I'd give a pass on the key lime pie.   When I go back, it's straight to the dry aged steak and truffle fries for me.",

    "text": "A nice thing about going to one of the big 3 steakhouse chains is that you know exactly what you're going to get.  Is is unusual or adventurous?  Of course not, but that's not why you're going to one of these restaurants.  You're going because you want a great piece of meat with a big, powerful, this-should-really-be-decanted-for-a-while red to go with it.  The Capital Grille absolutely delivers on that account.  My wife and I recently had dinner on a weeknight.   It's dark and full of wood paneling inside.  We saw a bunch of Steelers sitting at a table together.  We started off with oysters which were excellent as expected.  We split a spinach salad with warm bacon dressing which was also tasty.  Both we paired with a nice sparkling blanc de blanc.  For entrees, I went with their signature Kona-crusted sirloin with shallot butter and my wife had the filet Oscar.  Both were cooked perfectly.  We paired those with a nice, heavy, Merlot-dominant blend.  For dessert we got the homemade ice-cream and cookies.  The 3 flavors our night were vanilla, dark chocolate, and brownie batter (yes, it was as good as it sounds).  I also had a glass of vintage Taylor Fladgate that was superb.  Throughout the evening our server was quite attentive.  Despite eating on a Monday, the large space seemed mostly full.  Everyone has their own opinion about which of the big 3 steakhouse chains is their favorite.  Personally, I'm more partial to Ruth's Chris with their sizzling steaks with extra butter.  However, the Capital Grille is overall just as good and a great choice for this kind of dinner.",

We were pretty underwhelmed, and agreed that they must have really been phoning it in on the restaurant week menu items. The food was fine, not great. The servers were very nice and friendly, but I expect more polished service at an upscale restaurant. The regular menu looked really good, so if we could have afforded that I'm sure we'd have enjoyed the food much more. Probably won't go back.",

I recently had the spinach salad and that was reasonably priced at $11 and came with a savory bacon vinaigrette, which was great.  Bottom line, it's pricy but well worth every penny.

One of the best points about this place is the wine list... we're impressed with it every time we read it.  We're wine-ohs and this place satisfies our cravings, which is difficult to do in this uber conservative blue law state.    Do yourself a favor, go a bit before your reservation and sit at the bar for a drink.  It's easy to make an evening out of this place and you won't be disappointed when you do!",

    "text": "The Capital Grille is definitely a place to go for special occasions.  The service was superb.  The waitress was extremely knowledgeable about all menu items and wine pairings with menu items.  The bread basket was delicious, including some Passover friendly items.  I had the mozzarella, basil, tomato salad (let's just call it Caprese, though that isn't the official name on the menu).  The aged balsamic vinegar was delightful, as well as the basil.  The rest was ho-hum, but by no means bad.  Just average.  I partially blame myself for ordering a tomato based salad not during tomato growing season.  My mom and I split the lobster macaroni and cheese as well as the green beans.  Both were delicious and well executed, though my mom felt like the green beans were a little undercooked.  Dessert was the flourless chocolate espresso cake.  It was good, but didn't knock anyone's socks off.  What DID look amazing and tasted awesome was the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake.  It was also HUGE and would easily serve 3+ people.  Ambiance was wonderful with low lighting.  I could have used a few less dead animal heads around the place, but I get the vibe they're going for.  Wine list is expansive and also expensive, which gets to my next idea.  The place is very, very expensive.  You may notice we didn't get any steak, which the place is known for.  There is not a cut of meat available for under 40 bucks.  I get it, it's a fancy steak place.  Personally, I just couldn't muster spending that much for anything that is food. Call me cheap, but I call it smart.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went here two weeks ago before seeing \"Wicked\" at the Benedum Center. It's not a place we would normally do dinner unless it's a special occasion. However, since our tickets to the show coincided with Pittsburgh Restaurant Week, we decided to give it a try/see how the other half lives!  We were running a little late, so I called to let the restaurant know and was told they could hold the reservation for 15 minutes. When we arrived, were were seated in one of the smaller dining rooms off to the side, with only six tables in it. The atmosphere was not what I expected, with interesting art choices. A huge picture of August Wilson was basically at the table with us, while a painting of cows in a pasture hung across the way and the counter had a strange, brass statue of a falcon. It was museum-esque, almost suffocating. The room was a little too dim for my boyfriend, who doesn't have the best eyesight.  Although I did like that the tiny, battery operated lamps at each table. I wanted to take one home! The rest of the restaurant and bar area seemed more lively and upbeat, so if we go back I would request to sit in the larger, main dining area.   One thing that really bothered me was what happened when we were seated. The gentleman brought us to the table and, as he presented us with the special Restaurant Week Menu, said \"This menu is a great deal, we usually average over $100 per head,\" and then he left. His tone was condescending and it made me feel uncomfortable, like I should have felt privileged to be there. It's expensive, dude, I get it.   Our server, however, was fabulous. He was knowledgeable and attentive without hovering. The server's assistant, who was also serving our room, was also very polite and kept our water glasses full the entire night--even though we didn't order the fancy cucumber Fiji water like the table across from us. However, I think the uniforms/chef coat things they have their servers and other waitstaff wear are just weird, it didn't really seem to fit the who high-class, 1% vibe they had going on.  On to the food! Nom! We each started with a Caesar Salad, which was small, but delightful. The dressing was good, as were the Parmesan croutons. For the entrees, I chose the Seared Citrus Glazed Salmon and my boyfriend got the Bone-In Dry Aged Sirloin Steak (14oz). My salmon was very good, but the real star of the night was the steak. It was seasoned and cooked beautifully, and I had never been more jealous of my partner. (He was nice enough to share a few pieces, though. He's a sweetheart!) With the entrees, we were served sides family style, Sam's Mashed Potatoes and Fresh Green Beans. The green beans were just \"eh,\" but the mashed potatoes were some of the best I've had in a long time. Seriously, so good. When it came time to get dessert, we were slightly bummed as there were only two selections (Flour-less Chocolate Espresso Cake or Cheesecake with Fresh Berries) , while the website said there would be more options. I don't know if this is the fault of the restaurant or the folks who run the Pittsburgh Restaurant Week site. We both went for the cheesecake, but it turned out they had just run out. To our delight, our server allowed us to each get an order of their Classic Creme Brulee, which was also quite delicious. Next time, I really want to try the Strawberries Capital Grille! They sound phenomenal.   Wine! The wine list they have here is ridiculous. It is so long! So. Long. It's about 25 times the size of their normal dinner menu. We ordered a white blend that we shared during dinner and it was good.  Overall, our experience was nice. That steak. That steak gets 5 stars! As does the service we received from our waiter. I couldn't give the restaurant 5 stars though, because I was put off my the gentleman that seated us and by the atmosphere in the small dining room. I really felt like I needed to whisper, which is hard because I cannot whisper to save my life. I would possibly come here again for a special night out. And maybe this time, I will ask about getting one of those adorable little lamps!",

Finding a place to park around the restaurant is not enjoyable and when you have free valet, take advantage of it.  We have always made a reservation, never had any problems. I'm not sure how it works with walk-in's but i'm sure they would do their best to accommodate.  The service is wonderful. The wine list is amazingly large. They have a glass room in the dining room where you can see all the wines by bottle that they have. It's a menu in itself.  The menu is al-a-carte so it can get pricey especially when adding on wine.   Chopped Salad is delicious. They have a olive vinaigrette dressing with it that is outstanding. I would continually go back here just for this salad.   The dry aged steaks are very good. The filet Oscar is excellent.  Truffle fries and the lobster mac and cheese are to die for. You cannot leave here without trying them.",

We had made reservations and despite being about 5 mins late (construction had us turned around) we were greeted with a smile, our coats taken and promptly taken to our table.  Once we were seated we were greeted by Maria, who was our server for the evening.  She gave us suggestions for the menu and the drink specials.  She was attentive but not over bearing.  The food was just amazing too.  My husband and I each had a different cut of steak which were both cooked perfectly.  We also got the asparagus, which we both love, but the seasoning was not to our liking but it wasn't disgusting.  We did get the lobster mac and cheese which was some of the best mac and cheese that I have ever had.  It was super creamy and had a good amount of lobster in.  Over all our visit was great.  We will definitely be back.",

Several bottles of French wine from the well-curated list were procured and enjoyed. Soups and salads kicked off the meal; the wedge looked particularly good, and my French onion soup was deeply beefy and robed in enough cheese to move your cholesterol levels. I was the only person out of a party of seven to not order steak (my husband does it better than any chef), but I did not regret my shrimp stuffed with crab and lobster. My beef-eating colleagues reported that their steaks were done to perfection, and some came with intriguing extras like truffle butter. Service was impeccable, and the meal was well-paced and not rushed.  At its heart, however, the Capital Grille is still a chain, and it's hard to forget that. While the experience was flawless, if I were spending my money, I'd prefer a venue with a bit more personality.",

We had initially planned on going to Ruth's Chris, which is a personal favourite, but we were given a $50 gift card to Capital Grille which was enough to prompt us to give it a try.   The ambiance was very fine, calling to mind an era regrettably passed.  We began with a drink at the bar, and there the bartender was very helpful in taking us through the menu.  He also let us sample an excellent house martini made with pineapple and vodka.    For dinner we had a very nice Franciscan wine from Napa.  My wife had salmon and I filet mignon.  The steak was juicy and well prepared, though I must dash it ever so slightly as I had ordered it without mushrooms, which did not happen.  Our sides were mashed potatoes and cream spinach.  The spinach was particularly fine.    The service was beyond excellent - the waiters clearly take great pride in their work and execute it with pinpoint precision.  A lovely evening hopefully soon to be repeated.  Bravo!",

We asked for our wine to be served with dinner and we had to ask for it after the food came out (next time we will just ask for it right away!)  One of our 4 wasn't happy with the color of his steak...(I find the interpretation of rare/medium/well varies) After a send back the color was better but the steak was covered in a liquid... They said it was au jus but the first steak didn't have it...the manager was kind enough to take it off the bill...the other two steaks were above average but not as good as we were expecting.  I wanted to like this steakhouse - there is one down the street from me in DC and I had heard good things.  The steak and service didn't justify the price and hype.

    "text": "I was drawn to the restaurant on this evening for the outstanding Pittsburgh Restaurant Week promotion, a one-week event which draws in dozens of fine local establishments.  The Capital Grille offers the best deal and the finest quality of cuisine of the bunch: choice of salad or soup, entree, including three steak choices, side dishes of mashed potatoes and fresh green beans, and creme brulee or flourless chocolate espresso cake for the relatively low price of $35, less than half of what this meal would ordinarily cost.  The bread basket contains an interesting assortment including a matzoh-like item which was delicious and crisp.  The butter pats were soft and an excellent accompaniment to the bread basket choices.  My sirloin steak was delicious, but part of it (ordered medium rare) was raw.    The restaurant is beautiful and comfortable.  My wife and I were provided a spacious booth in a part of the restaurant that was not particularly noisy, though we were forced to wait for a good while despite there being many empty tables and booths when we arrived for our reservation.  I believe the idea is to get customers into the bar with a cocktail before they are seated at a table.  $15 for a delicious, but average-sized martini is profiteering.  I was surprised that there were no draft beers at a restaurant such as this, particularly one which has a large bar.  Our service from Koy was efficient, pleasant, gracious, and delightful.  Unlike the high-pressure tactics employed by our overbearing and overpowering server at Eddie Merlot's in Downtown Pittsburgh recently, Koy did not force us to listen to a lengthy recitation of dishes nor try to force anything on us that we did not want in order to pad the check.  My wife and I enjoyed an excellent evening!",

    "text": "WTFH Capital Grille?  It's been a while since I've been here, and every time I had been before was pretty much 5 stars.  However, last night I came here for a friend's birthday... and it was just a parade of horribles.    First thing, we had a reservation at 8:45, and we did not get seated until 9:30.  Considering our reservation was late, we were pretty hungry.  So waiting an extra 45 min., not exactly the most pleasant experience.  However, we got bread at the bar, which held us up.  To make up for that, they gave us two apps, which was quite thoughtful.  We had the calamari and prosciutto wrapped mozzarella.  Both were great!  We ordered a bottle of wine, a tempranillo from Spain as I recall, and that was excellent as well.  Then we ordered our entrees.  I got the filet with the kona rub, my friend got the crab cakes and lobster as her entree, and my other friend got the delmonico with the kona rub.    In a timely fashion, they brought my friend's crab cakes out and told us our steaks would be out very soon.  However, they didn't come out until 30 min or so after our friend was served.  But even before the steaks came out, the manager came over to apologize, and to say that they had accidentally burned our steaks and threw them out and they would be on the house.  We thought that was very nice and thoughtful, but we were thinking OK, what else is going to happen...   So we get our steaks, and mine is cooked to perfection.  My other friend's looks fine, but a little charred on the outside.  The waitress said it was because of the kona rub.  Nonetheless, after a few bites of his, he tried mine.  The waitress then came back and asked how the steaks were, and he said that his was burnt.  I really didn't believe it, so I tried it.  And wow, I had to spit it out it was THAT bad.    The waitress, flustered with us at that point offers to make him another and we decline.  I felt bad for her, she seemed to not be having the best night because it was so busy.  And we even said, we know it's not you, don't worry about it, and she replied, we're always busy and your experience should always be excellent here (or something along those lines).    Next, we ordered some creme brulee and some cappuccinos.  Our waitress brought out the cappuccinos and the creme brulee.  I sipped my cappuccino, and what do you know, it was COLD!  My other friend's was cold too.   We asked to speak to the manager, because we just couldn't believe this had happened.  We told him about the steak, and he said, \"and that's why we comped your whole meal.\"   However, we also told him about the cappuccinos as well, and he seemed a bit shocked, but said \"thank you for telling me.\"  He then seemed almost annoyed, and walked away.    All we wanted was a top notch dining experience in Pittsburgh for my friend's birthday, something you expect from Capital Grille.  However, we definitely did not receive one.  And even though our meal was comped, it was still a very disheartening night out and simply not worth it.  Sadly, I don't think I'll be coming back here.",

    "text": "Over the years, we've stopped in several times. I must admit that I was a bit put off learning their parent company is the same one that owns the Olive Garden and Bahama Breeze, but look: I've been to multiple \"upper echelon\" local eateries. The places that have an instant aura of pretentiousness and fresh-faced head chefs who believe they're the best of the best. None of those places seem to deliver for me - expensive, but average food flaunted like culinary masterpieces. This pattern is one of the most prevolent and disturbing in modern dining for me.  On the flip side, the Capital Grille has always had consistent, delicious food with attentive, friendly service. Yes, it's a chain and, yes, you're going to pay a bit more than an average night out. The food here is so worth it though! Personally, I don't have an issue splurging if the experience is worthwhile and, for me, it certainly is here. The steaks are fantastic! The sides are fantastic! The service is fantastic! I really have very few negative things to say about The Capital Grille.  I guess my only gripe would be the other patrons. They do attract some high profile types; maybe some you'd call yuppies. Generally, people keep to themselves - I had a few people cut in front of me in the coat check line. I guess those big shots had some big things going on - haha! The staff certainly isn't uppity or rude. They are extremely accommodating and attentive.  If you're looking for a great meal downtown, give The Capital Grille a try!! You'll pay a little more, but you'll go home happy and fulfilled!",

    "text": "I am definitely not the type of girl that frequents fancy restaurants. Only because I feel like sometimes they can be over hyped. However, I was not disappointed with my lunch at The Capital Grille. A few co-workers and I randomly set up a reservation 10 minutes prior to walking in the door and we were seated right away.   It really is a beautiful restaurant and the service was just as I had hoped it would be. Our waitress asked us before we ordered if we were on a time constraints which I thought was really nice. It made me feel like they would be willing to accommodate us if we needed it to be a quick lunch, but we didn't.   They brought out fresh bread to the table and it was amazing! It was so fresh that it was still steaming from coming out of the oven. I decided to order from one of their lunch specials which included an entree and soup for $20. I kept going back and forth between the steak sandwiches and truffle fries and the shrimp butternut squash risotto. I ended up picking the shrimp only because our waitress described it as tasting like fall in a dish and boy was she right! The shrimp were huge and cooked/seasoned perfectly and was a great accompaniment to the risotto. For my soup I almost ordered the clam chowder, but then she mentioned they had lobster bisque for an additional $5. I am so happy I went with the lobster bisque. Definitely one of the best in Pittsburgh!   I would highly recommend this place for lunch and look forward to coming back in the future.",

Our waiter Taylor, was very accommodating. To eat, I ordered the Bone In Kona crusted NY strip and my date got the Filet Mignon. We got the soy glazed Brussels sprouts with bacon to share. To drink, I ordered the blackberry bourbon sidecar and she got the grapefruit fire and ice (more fire than ice lol)   Everything came out perfect, the best steaks we ever had! Definitely will be going back!   Pro tip: use the Valet, it's only $7 (plus w.e you want to tip) and if you know how much a pain it is to find parking and how expensive garages are, it's completely worth it.",

However, overall there was nothing too outstanding about the place and the menu is very overpriced.   He got the clam chowder, salmon, accompaniments (green beans and mashed potatoes) and seasonal berries cheesecake dessert off the restaurant menu ($35.18). I got the lobster Mac and cheese ($18) from the regular menu. Portion sizes were decent. We didn't finish the accompaniments and I had to force myself to finish the Mac and cheese. It had a nice crunch from the topping but it seemed to overwhelm the lobster. There was a decent balance between the textures but I wasn't dying to finish it. The chowder was pretty thick while the Mac and cheese was runny. The salmon was nice and tender, my personal favorite from the meal. The green beans and potatoes were pretty bland; I had to add salt to give them flavor. Also adding the green beans to the Mac and cheese helped to counteract the flavor.  The service was pretty good. It was our anniversary so they added a complimentary dessert. The waiter came by to check on us a few times and seemed cordial enough. We made a reservation and were seated pretty quickly after arrival.   Conclusively I would not come here again, the food was nothing special. I have seen this chain before as well. But it was a nice experience.",

For $35.18 a person you got a choice of a soup or salad, for the second course steak, salmon or chicken, and then two desserts to choose from.   I got the field green salad with parmesan vinaigrette, an 8oz filet mignon medium rare, and flourless chocolate espresso cake for dessert along with a cup of coffee ($4 extra).  Let's just start by saying the parmesan vinaigrette was AMAZING, and the salad to dressing ratio was perfect. The vegetables and lettuce were fresh and crunchy as well.  My steak was cooked perfectly, and had a delicious \"crust\" on the bottom that had a delicious seasoning. The sides we were given were mashed potatoes and green beans with heirloom tomatoes. Both were delicious and my boyfriend and I finished both between the two of us.   Finally, dessert. This was insane. The flourless chocolate espresso cake was extremely rich and decedent, and literally melted in your mouth. It was a smaller piece of \"cake\" but with how rich it was, it was the perfect size.   All in all, this was one of the best meals I have ever had, and the service was amazing, especially for a night as busy as restaurant week. Would recommend to anyone!!",

The steaks are top notch and always cooked to proper temperature. Medium is pink in the center, as expected. The meat always arrives very hot, as if it's straight off the grille (out, hot from the oven), which I really appreciate.   Sides are typical of a high-end steak house: potatoes several ways, some green vegetables, all served with enough for 2-3 to share.  Table bread is very good; don't miss the brown raisin bread, it's excellent.   Salads and deserts are also pretty standard fare for a good, old-school steak house. The wine list is vast.   But the SERVICE is impeccable. Servers are professional but warm, and they know all the specials and all the menu items. There are others who keep the drinks filled frequently.   So, yes, I highly recommend this Capital Grille location.   One final tip:  just valet park. You won't find anything better.",

    "text": "We made the trek downtown to the Capital Grille for my mother-in-law's birthday in Jan 2013. We're not regulars to this classy (i.e. expensive) of an establishment so I only have a few other like-restaurants to compare our experience to.   Overall, the experience was quite nice. We ended up here during Restaurant Week which gave our wallets a break. Our server was prompt and attentive even knowing our bill would be much less than the normal 3-top.   I ordered clam chowder, a filet with grilled shrimp, and a cheesecake desert. The soup was delicious and my boyfriend tells me the cheesecake with fresh fruit was also great. (I was too full to eat it and had it boxed up to take home. They boxed it up very nicely for me, but since I was flying out of town for work the next day, he ate it!)   My steak, ordered medium rare, came out a bit more rare than I would have expected (cool red center instead of warm red) but it was tender and delicious none-the-less. The grilled shrimp was overcooked but I wasn't annoyed enough to complain at the time.   Now, I wont be back anytime soon, but that's more a factor of the price than anything else. It's definitely a special occasion kind of place for me, and I have a number of other places like that to try first!",

    "text": "As I've said a few times in other reviews, my Partner In Cuisine and I really try to avoid corporate restaurants, but the Capital Grille is a rare exception and it earns itself five stars.  Perhaps I am a bit biased because my one and only experience here was on my birthday, but given the exceptional level of service and food, I can't bring myself to give anything less.  The PIC went to great lengths to make my birthday dinner a special surprise after I had mentioned hankering for a good steak.  We arrived at the restaurant and were greeted immediately by not one, not two, but three people.  We were seated at a cozy little out of the way booth which had been set up with a tasteful sprinkling of birthday confetti.  I got my favorite drink from the bar (amaretto sour) which had been generously portioned with amaratto and before too long, we were getting a variety of breads to munch on.  The PIC had ordered our food before arriving so it wasn't even 10 minutes before I was looking at a delicious NY Strip (my favorite) and his filet as well as the most exquisite macaroni and cheese.  We ate everything!  After dinner, I received a complimentary cup of coffee and creme brulee which I shared with the PIC.  We left feeling fat and happy.  I feel that the wait staff really went to great lengths to make me feel special on my birthday.  Of course I'd go back again, but I think this is a place best kept for special occassions because it is NOT cheap (I stole a peek at the bill!).",

For my wife and I (neither of which drink alcohol) we spent $200 with tip. It was a special occasion, so I'm not complaining, but the cost can certainly be a limitation. Now for the positives, which are countless. The food is unmatched, the service is stellar, the place is absolutely spotless, classy, and not at all intimidating. I've only been once, but I can guarantee everything on the menu will send the average mortal into a fourth dimension. An absolute must try...even if it means a second mortgage.

Delicious! They have a gluten free menu, but still ask your waitress to alert the chef of your dietary issues. I was told today that the French onion soup without the crouton still has gluten in it from wheat in the soup base, but it is on the GF menu. Loss of one star for that, but at least i asked the waitress to check before I ordered it. They took care of my million of other food allergies with ease and it was an excellent dining experience.",

Although the place is upscale the daytime dress is usually business casual.  For a $20.19 3 course meal they had a good selection to choose from. I decided to go with their tossed salad to start followed by their seared honey glazed salmon with green beans and almonds. For my dessert I chose the flourless espresso chocolate cake. Service was top notch and I was given both heated dinner rolls as well as a huge delicious wafer I could break off and enjoy my meal with.   The restaurant is adorned with paintings of local notables such as Andrew Carnegie. I noticed that being centrally located in the city the Capital Grill is a great place to hold a business luncheon and as others have noted a good place for special occasions. Free WiFi is available.   My salad was delicious and my salmon entree was served on a very hot plate. Although it appeared small it was fairly dense and cooked to perfection. I got the opportunity to meet the manager Nick who welcomed me and asked if I needed anything then to see him.   Service was exceptional and they made sure I had plenty of drink as well as cleaning my table. Can't forget the piece de resistance-the flourless chocolate espresso cake with cream and a raspberry. Cake was small but oh so rich and yummy!   Best known as one of the city's many steakhouses I was glad that they have other options to choose from. Located in Piatt Place on 5th Ave across from the Milkshake factory public transportation as well as nearby parking garages are available.",

Clam chowder: very creamy, thicker than others I've had.   Bleu cheese salad: it was half a cabbage with salad sauce and some bleu cheese. It was fine. Nothing special.  Filet Mignon: I had better and cheaper(in regular menu, it is almost 50) filet mignon before. It was soft but I felt they only use salt for the flavor.   NY strip: Tasted similar as the filet mignon, but it was a little burnt outside.  We liked the sides for the steak. The smashed potato was very creamy and buttery.   Cheesecake: a little too soft.  Chocolate cake: very bitter, I can tell it was made with pure dark chocolate.",

I had actually been recommended to come here for a while, and we figured that we would take advantage of the deal.   This restaurant was fantastic! They have a very nice selection of wines, and we began our dinner with the New England clam chowder. Our waiter was exceptional, tolerating my boyfriend's bad dad jokes all night. Our soup was followed by the main course. We both ordered steaks. I ordered an 8oz filet mignon, topped with crab oscar, and he ordered a 14oz NY strip with a side of lobster tail. The steaks were cooked perfectly, and tasted amazing. Interestingly, the lobster tail had already been stripped from the actual shell of the lobster, so we were presented with just the meat and butter. It was a different way to present.   Our food was fantastic. Both entrees included a side of mashed potatoes and green beans, which we barely touched because we were so focused on the entrees before us. We ended up taking some of the food home, which means left overs!  The meal ended with dessert. I ordered a cheesecake, while he ordered an espresso chocolate cake. I think I made the better decision, for sure. Overall, the food was fantastic. The restaurant was incredibly busy for a Monday night, likely due to the special, so reservations are a must! That being said, we still got ample attention and service, and our meal was wonderful. We had a fantastic night, and will be sure to dine again, this time with the full menu.",

It was restaurant week during our visit which made for a shorter menu than usual.  However, every dish looked and tasted delicious.  For my meal I went with the field greens salad.  The salad had a great flavor and I loved the dressing.  Made for a great starter.  For my meal I went with the Grille's Signature Cheeseburger.  I ordered mine medium rare and it was cooked to perfection.  The meat is topped with a delicious white cheddar and candied bacon.  The sweetened bacon and high-quality cheese made for a great flavor.  The meat was a delicious blend and tasted very fresh.  The bun was also a great choice and held everything together perfectly.  The burger came with a side of truffle fries which had a great crispy texture to them.  The fries went very well with their house made ranch.",

We laughed and told her once seated, that table was full for the night! She came back and said whenever we are ready. What can I say about the food? It's outstanding as all cap grilles are! We had numerous appetizers, hot and cold. Everything was great. The bone-in filet, although not in the menu, is a death row meal. Mashed potatoes were awesome. Everything was great.

We got the cheesecake for desert and it was absolutely delicious. My fiance for the espresso cake and the coffee flavor was strong but I could of used a little more sweetness for my taste. It was good but the cheesecake was great and we will definitely get again. The wait staff was amazing. They also bring a variety of bread tot he table as well. It came out hot and fresh. The butter they serve with it has added spices. We also got drinks at the bar before dinner and they didn't have a lot to choose from but my cosmopolitan was good! Highly recommend.

I do have to say the lettuce wedge salad was a bit...doused in dressing.  The Dry Aged New York Strip sounded good on paper---my waiter told me they age their steaks for 18-24 days. However, when I actually tasted the steak, I couldn't tell if it was aged or not. Overall, it was a solid piece of meat, but could use some more seasoning. As for the filet---it came out way more raw than it should have. A rare looked like a blue rare when I cut into it, so I had to send it back to the kitchen.  I'm not sure if the food wasn't as good because of restaurant week, but nearly everything else about the restaurant---wine menu, service, ambiance, are great.",

We went for Restaurant Week but we really splurged with the upgrades.  For my 3 courses, I chose the wedge salad, filet mignon, and espresso cake. I also added a lobster tail for 10 bucks. Everything was amazing!  My filet melted in my mouth like butter and the lobster tail was excellent.  My husband upgraded to the Kona crusted NY Strip and omg it was incredible!!! We paid $45 for soup, the steak, and dessert... and the steak is regularly $47 on the regular menu!  He also added the crab Oscar and it was a huge portion for $10! He got the cheesecake dessert and it was excellent as well.  Excellence all around! Our server, Rebecca was fantastic and treated us wonderfully.  Obviously, I highly recommend Capital Grille and will certainly be back!",

We also had the lobster Mac and cheese and it was very tasty as well. My main course was the porcini ribeye steak. It was awesome, and cooked to perfection. They was a type of balsamic glaze that was amazing. I forgot to mention the delicious well drink they have as well. I had a Manhattan Rye and I really liked it.  The service was excellent as well.

Then, the final touch, As we were about to leave Maria again congratulated us, and gave my beautiful wife a fresh rose. I have never seen service so good it brought my new wife to tears until last night.  This is an expensive treat, but you get what you pay for.

I reserved a table for 2 for Valentine's Day months in advance and was looking forward to this night for months. My boyfriend and I were greeted by some really cool valet guys that parked our car for us. We went inside and waited for a few minutes and were sat at a lovely large table in the corner in a separate room. The table was decorated for Valentine's Day with glitter. Our server was incredibly friendly and attentive and answered our questions with a smile (as a server, I KNOW we were being annoying with all of our questions) but she was happy to help us. My boyfriend and I both started with the spicy pan-fried calamari with cherry peppers. It was so good! If you like seafood and spicy food, you have to try it. This coupled with the variety of artesian bread was a great way to start our night together. Then we both settled on the surf & turf with lobster mac & cheese as our side. My surf & turf was delicious - filet mignon with South African lobster tail. Delicious, sweet, buttery, and both the steak and lobster melted in my mouth. The lobster mac & cheese was easily the best mac & cheese i've ever had. For dessert, my boyfriend had the signature cheesecake and I had the flourless chocolate espresso cake. Both of these desserts were probably two of the best desserts I've ever had in my life. Our night together was romantic and memorable and the food was INCREDIBLE! It was our first Valentine's Day together and it was certainly very memorable thanks to The Capital Grille. I'm certainly one for trying new places, but I think I may have found a new tradition for Valentine's Day. As a Darden employee, I have eaten at almost every other Darden concept, and I can easily say this is my favorite (sorry Olive Garden ). Five stars doesn't express how fervently I would recommend this place.",

Our San Jose Sharks group was quite large almost filling the entire restaurant. Kenny, our waiter was \"Most Excellent\" and his attention to detail was spot on.   Immediately, Kenny brought a warm basket of breads.  The house-made pumpernickel bread with raisins was the highlight, and I will have to have it shipped to California. Kenny also had an excellent knowledge of the Wine list and recommended a unique full-bodied Pinot Noir from Oregon with flavors of cherry, red plum, and dark chocolate. One by one, course by course, the food arrived and placed on our table family style sharing all of the sides and appetizers. Of particular mention, was the perfectly prepared crispy Prosciutto Wrapped Mozzarello with Vine Ripe Tomatoes. The Grilled Asparagus in Lemon Oil and the Scalloped Potatoes were delicate and brought to the table in a wonderful presentation. The filet mignon was a perfectly prepared Medium Rare. Kenny also arranged for a Pittsburgh Latte to go. Thank you very much to the entire staff and most especially Kenny for a wonderful \"Group Dining\" experience.",

Free appetizer, free glass of wine, free birthday dessert sampler AND two free glasses of champagne!     Plus the food was extraordinary and well worth the price.  The Chilean sea bass was so full of richness and flavor!  The lobster mac and cheese was amazingly tender and my boyfriends steak had not a single piece of fat or gristle.

It was my wife's birthday dinner and I botched it, reserving a place the evening before and not realizing it until we arrived the following night and they didn't have us on the list.  It was a one hour wait to get seated.  The woman at the front of the house told us we could sit at the bar if we wanted to get in faster, and my wife, disappointed, lamented that she didn't want to spend her birthday dinner experience at a barstool.  And...they fit us in.  Like...within five minutes.  Straight across the board the wait staff was top notch, and added special little touches to make it a nice night for my wife.  Loved the wagyu beef carpaccio appetizer.   Really enjoyed the lobster bisque Was a little disappointed in the \"special\" (more in a minute) Thoroughly enjoyed the birthday dessert they brought my wife gratis.  What was going to make this a three star review (but I thought better of it) was the entree special, which was a NY strip with a Gorgonzola cheese sauce with a red wine reduction.  The reduction was sweet.  TOO sweet for me.  I didn't like how it paired with the cheese sauce OR the steak.  The steak was cooked just right, but was a little tough, and I had to cut a couple inedible pieces off.  I'm not sure whether to chalk that up to not awesome steak, or just my lack of experience with Strip steak vs. Filet.  When i looked back over the evening, the only thing they didn't nail was the sauce on the steak (and arguably the meat, but really...come on) and although it's a place that is KNOWN for its steak, I think a 4 start rating is deserved.",

Our waitress Jade was very good. The main entrees were only ok, there was nothing special about them. The True gems were the shareable sides, particularly the lobster mac and cheese.

There are great paintings on all the walls including a great one of Mr. Rogers and there are several mounted animal heads high-up on some walls.    Their bread and the selection is very good including the pumpernickel and lavash. They serve butter that is some the best you can get. \"European-style\" Cultured Butter I would say.  From the Bar we ordered a Grey Goose martini with blue cheese stuffed olives perfectly made and the olives were some of the best I have had. The apple martini was weak for some reason but had good taste. With dinner a bottle of Concha y Toro, Marques Casa de Concha 2010 Carmenere went so well with our steaks.  To start I had the Wedge salad that was pretty good for sure right up there with some of the best. The lettuce was appropriately extremely cold and crisp. While the blue cheese dressing was good indeed, it could have been a little stronger of the blue for my own taste, but the tomato wedges and the bacon were outstanding. The Onion soup was tasty with a great topping of oozy melted crusty cheese.  We also had Wagyu Beef Carpaccio that I would grade outstanding.  Specials of the night are always worth a review and discussion with your server. Tonight, one that sounded great was a preparation of wild pacific salmon, but we were here for the steaks tonight.  My dry age strip steak was a very flavorful piece of meat and the tenderloin with porcini sauce and the poached lobster was a super combination, tender and flavorful, decadent perhaps; just great . The filet that we asked to be treated with the Kona was very good. Also at our table we had he porterhouse which was a good size, nicely done and very tasty. To reiterate a bit, we enjoyed good flavor with all the steaks and all were prepared as ordered.  Service, first and last was outstanding. Our server's knowledge was just short of encyclopedic. Everything about everything on their menu and anything about all the food and perpetrations she was able to recite.  She was very professional, fast and prompt in an apparent effortless and smooth manner. Wine she knew all about, yes she did. \"Oh I think you would want that wine filtered\", so she decanted our wine as her own recommendation for what we had. \"Not going to finish the wine; want it back in the bottle\", not a problem and immediately it was done.  They are very busy on the weekends and when we arrived for our 8PM reservation the dining rooms were at 95 percent full. If you arrive without a reservation you might have a chance to eat in the lounge area high tops, bar, or the few tables in the area.   If you like great dining and great steak and can afford an upscale price; Capital Grill is worth the occasional experience.",

I typically thoroughly enjoy dining here. On this evening, not at all. We were seating in the lounge right next to the doorway. The foyer area was packed which allowed the bar and lounge to back up with unsafe crowding. The table was not a normal sized table for four. The waitress had to yell when speaking to us. There was little opportunity to have conversation with the noise level. I had countless ass in my face from people standing near the table. Constantly be bumped as well. At 6:30 pm they were out of shellfish platters and augratin potatoes. How can that happen? I can't afford to come here but once or twice a year. After spending about $440 with tip all I got was \"it's really crazy tonight. Come back another time, I'm sure it will better.\" Guess what it will probably be a long time. Again the food was good. But I come here for the full experience - no excuse was going to be acceptable. There are other overpriced steakhouses. Very disappointed!",

I had the porterhouse and my wife the New York strip, both 28 day dry aged.  Without a doubt it was the best steak I have ever eaten.  Even better than the 40 day dry aged Himalayan sea salt ribeye steak I had at David Burke's in chitown.  No comparison really.   We had the calamari and roasted pepper appetizer and enjoyed it...could hardly eat it all.  Enjoyed our meal by splitting a yummy spinach salad topped with hot bacon dressing.  What a good night and good meal.  We were surprised with a \"first timer\" free dessert.  It was a two sided plate with a chocolate fudge-like delight on one side and a wonderful cheesecake fusion on the other...it was so good we even ate the 'words off the plate'...have to be there know this. Heart of the city which is nice and a wonderful decor and atmosphere.  Comp valet parking makes parking in the city a breeze!

I immediately had my eye on the 10 oz. Filet Mignon steak and ordered one cooked medium. Our waitress recommended various marinades and rubs, but the Kona coffee with shallot butter one piqued my interest. Well, it turned out to be \"I'm going to chew each and every bite of this ever so slowly so this lasts forever\" kinda delicious, tender and juicy.  We also all shared an order of the Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese, which was one of the best side dishes I've eaten in a long time. I probably could have just eaten a couple bowls of this and been happy the rest of the night. Dessert was Creme Brulee topped with blueberries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries. Words cannot express what a delightful epilogue this was to the entire meal.  Service: Top-notch! Our waitress was over-the-top friendly. Although slightly animated, she was knowledgeable, prompt, friendly and resourceful the entire time. Our water glasses never dipped below half-full and she even comped one of our desserts and our post-dinner coffees. Granted, it's not a huge deal for what you pay for all the entrees and drinks (the wine list is longer than the menu), but it was not required, but much appreciated.  The good news is there are Capital Grille's all over the U.S. So, if you're smart, you'll make a reservation, throw on something nice, grab your wallet (fa sho) and enjoy a wonderful evening of wining and dining in style.",

It was a very busy night as the Steelers were in town and the restaurant was seating two very large groups of Cardinals fans. As we have come to expect from the CG, the food was excellent. But we found the  service to be below our past experiences. When our server delivered an overcooked steak to my wife,  a restaurant manager noticed our frustration and stepped in to relieve us of the need to lodge a complaint with our server. So that the my wife would not sit with nothing to eat while they fired another steak, the manager sent her a wonderful crabmeat cocktail. The manager later returned with a perfectly cooked steak.

For $200+ -totally dissatisfied. Will not be returning.",

    "text": "Went for an early birthday dinner. We had the calamari with peppers as a starter with a basil gin martini and the bohemian all very good. The bohemian being the best out of both drinks. Not over sweet like many like it. For the main course we had the 22 oz Porterhouse steak and the Chef's Choice Filet Mignon with mushrooms.   We picked the Lobster Mac and Cheese and the Tomato, Basil, Mozzarella salad for our sides.  All excellent.  For dessert we had the cheesecake and the coconut cream pie.  It was a struggle at this point to eat a single bite more,  but it was so good we pushed through the pain.  Service was top notch and classic high end American style.  Everything came out quickly but at proper intervals.  Lucky for me the manager was a co-worker at a previous job and made sure we were well taken care of.  Definitely worth the $$$$ (dolla dolla bills yo - as Yelp says).",

As it was a party, I sampled a lot of foods.  But I didn't eat a full meal.  I'm guessing everything we ate was catered so I'm not sure what all is on the regular menu. Overall, everything was great.  Before the food, the ambiance was quite nice.  There is a main dining area, and there is also a private room toward the back.  The restaurant was set up very nicely, and I would definitely come back here for a nice evening.  I didn't realize it was a Darden Chain, but this is ten steps above Olive Garden and Red Lobster.  Favorite Food Sampled: Risotto Fritters:  I loved these FAR too much.  It's grown up deep fried mac and cheese, and it made me so happy.  Perfect in the cold weather.  It's creamy and cheesey and warm.  SO DELICIOUS.  I may have eaten ten (or twelve).  Other things I sampled:  Two glasses of wine (OK.  More than a sample there.), fresh tomato and mozzarella crostini, proscuitto, smoked Norwegian Salmon on onion pita crisps, cheese platter, and grilled vegetables.  Everything was delicious.  No complaints.  Ok.  I don't get the massive picture of Mr. Rogers at all.  In a place that is supposed to be \"classy,\" it was just weird.  It was like Mr. Rogers was watching me eat.  I mean, local flavor is cool.  But this was just pushing it.",

Ordered the signature cheeseburger, truffle fries, and wedge salad.  There was also an option for homemade mint lemonade or a fresh made iced tea with a simple syrup. Burger was delivered used down in half and the burger itself looked good but did not deliver on taste. this could be because it was takeout, so not too hot (although it is 5 blocks from my hotel so not a long ride). Fries were over salted, nice truffle flavor but again, seemed to have been made much earlier.  The wedge was the most disappointing because i was looking forward to what is described as wedge with blue cheese and applewood smoked bacon  Got the iceberg lettuce and some bacon but no blue cheese.  Also no utensils, or napkins.  And possibly a ranch or creamy italian dressing.  very disappointing.  Not sure this is a fair review because it was ordered though the service but should just be a pickup service that they grab the bag and deliver and because of that i think it bears mentioning that this did not live up the Capital Grill level of service and product.",

My wife and I visited in November for our anniversary. My wife ordered the filet cooked medium. They brought out a well done steak. Normally we wouldn't complain, but at $60 for a steak I expect top notch. Our waiter was great and immediately took it back and brought another in 5 minutes. Believe it or not it was also cooked too much! But it tasted good and they didn't charge us so we were happy.  We visited yesterday for my Mother in laws birthday. I ordered a strip steak for $50. To be totally honest it was one of the worst steaks I've ever had. Very tough and chewy. I've had better $10 steaks at Ponderosa. I'm not exaggerating. I took 4 bites and threw in the towel. I didn't want to make a fuse being with my in-laws, so I quietly asked for it to be wrapped up. It's sitting in my garbage can right now. I don't know if they're sourcing lower quality meat or what. For $50+ steaks, they should be excellent. The service was great as always, but the food was just awful. Frankly, I won't be back.",

I was greeted immediately upon my arrival and the hostess stand checked my coat and luggage. It wasn't busy at all for a Thursday afternoon I would have to blame it on the rain because the menu options were superb. I was torn I came in to try out the restaurant week menu but I couldn't take my eyes off the lobster roll and Parmesan truffle . I ordered a goose Bloody Mary which was decent heavy on the goose which I prefer...The bartender Katie was kinda distanced at first but me and another patron got her talking and she warmed up quickly:). As shown in my pics the serving size for the fries and the roll was good for a lunch portion . Now when I think of Parmesan truffle fries I think of shoestring style fries I was presented with thick cut fries with no Parmesan....now don't get me wrong y'all know I haven't met a fry I didn't like . It's just I had a different thing pictured.  The lobster roll could've had more seasoning it was pretty bland The brioche roll was to die for. Was I dissatisfied with my lunch noooo I was way to hungry for that was I blown away... not this time",

    "text": "I can't speak more highly of our visit to the Capital Grille last night!   We have eaten here maybe 7 times now and I have never been to a more consistently hospitable restaurant.   To preface, I spent 10 years in the service industry and would consider myself to have high restaurant standards compared to others. My family and friends hate eating with me because I know what good service is and expect it (as should anyone paying to have a meal prepared and served to their liking).   Now that you have the flavor of what kind of restaurant snob I am, let me tell you why The Capital Grille deserves five stars...  When we arrived for our reservation, we were politely greeted and promptly sat. I saw the sign for their HUGE wine event and as a non drinker immediately thought \"ugh, I hope they don't hate us because we aren't planning on drinking.\"   While our server was still with her other tables, our waters were filled, an iPad to browse wines and desserts was offered and bread brought to our table.   When our server Katie, whom I have never met, made it over to our table she warmly greeted us like we were regulars, using my name from our reservation. From there she fielded our questions and took our order.  On her recommendation, I ordered the surf and turf which consisted of a Filet and African Lobster Tail (I had only ever had the Maine tail), the hubby ordered a Filet and of course we ordered the Lobster Mac to share. To start we had a crock of French Onion soup (truly the best I've ever had) and the wedge salad (always good until I remember how much more I like the soup) that we shared. I was almost full before our meals came!  Our meals arrived, the presentation gorgeous, so excited to eat the biggest lobster tail I had ever seen! I cut into my filet, slightly undercooked but delicious. I'm a medium rare kind of girl so I'll take under vs over any day and I wasn't overly concerned because I had the huge tail and I could take the filet to eat the next day :) The hub's filet was cooked to perfection and the Lobster Mac was steamy and delicious as it always is.   Now the tail... It was beautiful and from Africa so I couldn't wait! To my disappointment, it had a really fishy taste to it :( since I've never had an African tail before and had nothing to compare it to, I wasn't going to say anything. Katie came over and could tell I didn't love it. I didn't want to make a big deal about it but within minutes she had whisked that away and came out with what I know and love- the Maine tails. I was so impressed and my tastebuds were dancing with delight!   After we were stuffed with deliciousness our table was cleared and scraped to the cloth. Katie presented us with a gift from the restaurant- a beautiful arrangement of 2 of their desserts and berries on a plate that had \"Just Married\" written in chocolate sauce. Not only was it so incredibly thoughtful and beautiful, it was delicious! We were so excited and felt so special!  If that wasn't enough, at some point during our meal Katie had asked us if there was a reason we weren't drinking and I shared with her that we just don't drink alcohol at all. I assumed she wanted to talk wines with us but she was respectful and that was it. After our dessert was cleared, she brought us over non-alcoholic sparkling soda with sorbet in martini glasses so we could have something to toast our wedding over!!! What an incredibly thoughtful gesture!!!!  Our visit was last night and as I am writing this review today, I know this will be an experience we will remember forever. Some of these reviews talk about the weird decor or overpriced food but I promise you there is no dollar amount you can put on making your guests feel like they are the only ones there and that all you want to do is make them happy.   My 5 stars clearly include the service, quality of the food, cleanliness of the restaurant and bathrooms and overall experience.   Thank you Capital Grille for a night to remember. I look forward to our next visit :)",

The waiters and waitresses are professional, super friendly, and know everything about the food they are serving you, as they should. Their assistants are also very professional and attentive, You'll never ask for a refill of water. The atmosphere is dark and sexy, many beautiful paintings hang on the walls. Best steaks you can get in Pittsburgh, hands down. I recommend the filet, gorgonzola and truffle crusted with cabernet reduction. The lobster mac and cheese is sinfully rich and filled with huge chunks of lobster. The truffle fries are as addicting as crack cocaine and the lobster bisque is perfect. One of my favorite restaurants in any city.",

We arrived about 20 minutes early and went to the bar for a drink.  The bar was packed and very loud so we were really looking forward to sitting at at a nice quiet table but we were not.  Our table was right by the bar!  It was so loud and people were standing right by the table.  We were also disappointed to see people in hoodies and jeans the minute we walked in the door.  I was disappointed that there is not a dress code enforced.  Our waiter was very nice and attentive but we waited a long time in between courses.  We sat down at 7:30 and had an appetizer and salads.  Our steaks did not arrive till after 9.  Now I'm all about enjoying an evening out but that was too long to wait.  By the time our steaks arrived we weren't even hungry anymore because we had filled up on bread waiting.    For the price that we paid I do not think this place was worth it.  There are a lot better steakhouses in Pittsburgh for less money and you will receive a better overall experience!",

I made a reservation online because it is a busy place to dine in. I thought that arriving on time was going to be at issue because I decided to go 5 days prior to the inauguration. But no, I arrived on time and was directed to a not-so-loud room as requested in my reservation. Service can be described in one word: impecable. Food: I would like to find a place which main entrees would not be beef. But, this is US and the most fanciful traditional American cuisine dish is a steak. I should not complaint because my meal was exquisite. Perfect term, moist but broiled, medium rare, pleasant cut. The salad is one of the best salads I have every eaten. It reminded me the one I ate with Janica while being in NY my last trip. My mother in law ordered the fish. The buttery cream that accompanies the fish had a soft flavor, rich and tasty. The spinach had a combination of flavors that had a not so good acceptance by my palate. The creme brulee was, OMG!, a difficult choice to make but a satisfactory one.",

The Capital Grille was the family's first choice as we had always had a good experience with past visits to CG.  We were seated promptly upon arriving and then proceeded to wait 15 minutes for ANYONE to stop at the table.  Other tables were being sat and served and we sat and sat and sat.  When we finally ordered drinks and they were served, we let the server know that we had a 7 p.m. show to attend and that we needed to pick up the pace.  No response and service lagged on.....  To make a long story short, the food was wonderful, as usual, but the service made the experience a poor one.  We had zero time for coffee or dessert and barely made the show.  You would think when someone makes a 5 pm reservation on a Saturday evening the staff would realize that you have to be somewhere for a show.  A usually good \"go-to\" place in town was very, very disappointing.....",

I've eaten there about 3 times and have experienced wonderful food and extraordinary service.  The decor is very gentleman's club and over the top masculine.  I particularly like the Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese, which is gourmet comfort food.  Their wine list is heavy on the reds, and their strength is American wines.  I believe they have an extensive collection of over 2,000 bottles.    But honestly, people go here to impress a business client, or for a special occasion.  It's a great place to go if you are not picking up the tab and you want to feel pampered.  The menu is more diverse than both Ruth Chris and Mortons, when it comes to the food, I think the Capital Grille far outshines the competition.   The Sommelier is well trained and knows a lot about food pairings and making wine recommendations.     So overall, the Capital Grille is expensive, but at the same time high quality, and is always my first choice when recommending a steak house.",

I had one bad experience in all my times going, but the response from management was so awesome, I can't even count that against them. Capital Grille used to me my number one go to spot, but I'm not sure it's worth the cost anymore. The steak is always delicious but their sides could be better. I have to say their cheesecake is my all time favorite cheesecake! I'd recommend you give Capital Grille a try if you haven't. It's a nice experience, just don't think I'll be going as often as I used to.",

We both ordered our steaks medium rare and two steaks were VERY different. Mine was almost rare and my husband's had no red center at all (too cooked). The service wasn't bad, but not excellent. Maybe because lunch fares are more casual? Noticed that they do offer cheaper lunch Plate menus($20 for appetizer+entree), so I might try that with some girlfriends next time. But for $150+tip for lunch, I wasn't too thrilled about my experience today.",

The amazing Jonathan D. took me to TCG for a birthday lunch today where I enjoyed their combo lunch of Butternut Squash Bisque, Lobster Roll and Parmesan/Truffle Fries. He had the Wagyu Mushroom burger and seemed very pleased with it. For ~$20/each it truly doesn't get any better. In addition, the pre-meal bread was so fresh out of the oven, it was actually too hot to touch. Our server Tina noticed that I opened a gift before the meal, assumed it was my birthday, and provided us with dessert afterwards. What service!!! True - it isn't for everyday meals, but I say a special occasion can be a random Tuesday, so treat yourself!",

    "text": "Went to this place with my colleagues as were in town for work. We had to drive around twice to get the valet parking as the place was packed. This was sign that a right place was picked for dinner.  Food- We were eight people so ordered a lot of items from each section so get ready to read a long review!   Appetizers: Pan fried Calamari with hot cherry peppers- As the name suggests it was hot. It was not too crispy and little on the softer side. But the flavor and taste was really good. I would give it 4/5 because I like calamari a little crispy. There is no sauce that comes with it so if you want one,you need to ask. A few of my co-workers could not handle the spice so if you don't eat medium spicy,this is not for you!  Pork belly with tomato jam- the portion was really small like really small which was good I think as the dish was not too good in taste. It tasted soggy and the tomato jam was overpowering the bacon taste. I would not recommend it personally.  Truffle fries- I would say that this was my favorite out of all the appetizers! A must try! The portions are not too bad either and good enough to share with 2-3 people.  Brussels sprouts with bacon- Perfect amount of oil and flavor. Nothing too fancy or unique, if you don't want anything else then sure go for it otherwise there are better options like the fries!  They also serve various kinds of breads which also fills you up so decide your appetizers accordingly.  Main course:  I do not eat steak so I decided to go with Chilean sea bass with mushroom soy broth- it was good, the broth had a nice aroma and was tasting perfect with the fish! So if you like something with not too much spices, do not eat steak and want something very neutral in taste and easy to finish then I would recommend this.  My co-workers ordered steak but they had one comment in common that even medium rare was overdone which reduced the juice and flavor. I have no comments on that as I know nothing about steak!  Sides: - Lobster Mac and cheese- The lobster comes in giant pieces mixed in Mac and cheese. I was expecting very small pieces mixed well in Mac and cheese but that was not the case. The taste was good, top was crispy, and it's Mac and cheese (I don't know what else to say). Definitely recommended!  - Mashed potatoes - it made a good side for people who ordered steak as Steak does not come with any side. It was good and definitely worth getting if you are getting steak.  - Asparagus - I thought it was very oily so I couldn't eat more than one bite. I could taste the oil.   Dessert: - New York cheese cake - We ordered that because they had no more Creme Brulee but the top part tasted exactly the same. 4/5  - Warm Double chocolate cake- it's chocolate lava cake with ice cream on the side. I love chocolate so I would say that this was my fav dessert! 5/5  - Fruit sorbet - I did not like it much, found it too tangy but I guess it's because I am not a sorbet fan. But there are better options in my opinion so why go for this!  - Trio of handcrafted ice creams- This does not come with \"cookies\" as the description says! There was this one biscotti looking cookie that is very hard to break and three ice creams with one scoop each.   Drinks- They have a good wine list! I got the Cabernet - \"Frank\" , liked it!   Overall comments - The service was great, ambience was really good, good music in the background , our server was very attentive and very honest about the recommendations. I would definitely recommend it as a good place for a special occasion, date night, or work lunches/dinners. It is definitely pricey but the service, food, ambience is equal to the price.   Sorry, I only have 2 pictures to share - My main course and the chocolate dessert!   Cheers and live,laugh and love!",

No personality when I asked what steak she recommended she named 2 and walked away. Never said why she recommended them. I was ordering a bottle of wine and asked about 3 different kinds and she just said the most expensive but with no reason. Although I heard her in conversation with the 2 men next to us that may have been regulars and wondered why she would not be the same with us I then asked about the appetizers to see about getting some conversation that was authentic but she just said \"it depends on what you like are you ready to order?\"and had no suggestions. We ordered the garlic shrimp and Caesar salad. Garlic shrimp was so bland it was a waste of calories and Caesar salad was average. She never came over to ask how everything was and when we didn't finish the shrimp she just took it away and never asked why. Steak was good but definitely had better and the salmon was average . Sadly I can say I've had a better meal at Houlihans and the service at the Capital Grille was below average. I'd never waste my money there again.",

Granted, I know how annoying it is not to be punctual, but it seemed a little excessive.  Steaks all arrived in the wrong temperature. Either undercooked or overcooked. Also, the tuna steaks had been seared (and in one case, completely cooked through) when the request was for them to be raw. Honestly, I don't know that any one out of our group of eight had one dish right.  The server was nice, and our table was a prime people watching spot.   I'd give them points on the desserts, the lobster mac n cheese and the Malbec.   But for the price, my expectations were high.",

The waiter asked me to get up and move so he could get by, what???  So when I sat sideways against the wall (due to no moving room) he said thank you. Not okay.   There was an elderly man who needed a seat and went roaming into the coat room in desperation for a chair because he was standing for 30 minutes waiting for a table that he made a reservation for. No one noticed so I went into the coat room myself (as a customer) to bring him a chair so he didn't fall down.   After asking ourselves to be sat at a table where we weren't being hit by customers and waiters, we were moved to a regular table. Then our food was an hour late because the kitchen \"made a mistake\" on roasted chicken. (?)

    "text": "My husband and I ate here a couple years ago and LOVED it. We couldn't wait to have a reason to come back to Pitts and eat here again. 12/8/18 Came in town for a concert. We made reservations for our dinner well in advance of our trip and arrived 10 mins early. We were told upon arrival that they were running about 15 minutes behind on reservations because the concert that night and the place was packed. We didn't mind having to wait 15 mins for our table, try and be easy going. however 6:30 comes around and we still are waiting for a table. I overhear my husbands name quietly being said at the host stand. I said to the hubs I think we're next. But the host picked up the ticket and heads to the bar to look for the guests. He never did ask if we were the names on the ticket. After seating whoever it was, I said oh I must have misheard them and it wasn't us. After waiting another 15 mins my husband finally goes and asked when we will be sat. He gives our name again at which time the hostess has a look of quick panic and says you're next. My husband said by the look on her face she assumed we were already sat. So someone claiming to be us got tired of waiting and took our table. So FINALLY we get sat at 7 and ordered immediately. We have less then an hour to order, eat, and get to the venue. Which we were going to walk to. Again, we were looking so forward to this delicious meal. We were told by the host stand that they were getting food out of the kitchen quickly because most were going to the concert. Okay we still have 45 mins to enjoy dinner. Our food didn't come  to our table till 7:40 we immediately asked for the bill and paid it while eating as fast as we could and had to call for a car to drive us as we had no time to walk. My husbands steak was over cooked and if we weren't in such a rush we would have sent it back. My meal I will say, was delicious but I didn't get to enjoy it. Would have chose something small from the menu if we knew the kitchen was going to take longer then we were told. We spent 2 hrs here, to spend less then 10 minutes \"enjoying\" our meal. And got to spend over $200 for the joy of it. And then had to pay for a car. Loved this place the first time we came. Probably would have loved it again if all went the way we were told it would. Mostly disappointed with the lack of communication with us from the staff, the morons who took our table, and what we paid to shove food down as fast as possible.",

    "text": "In a hurry to get back to work, I ordered the lobster mac and cheese to go.   Atmosphere: Upon arrival, I noticed that the place was neat and the customers happy. Wish I could stay and enjoy my meal there.   Food: I read a review that there were \"huge chunks of lobster\" in this bowl. This was not the case with my Togo order. I maybe had a full 1-2 pieces of lobster about an inch in length. Maybe they were having an off day... but that's all I got. Quite disappointing considering the price. I might as well have ordered a single lobster tail.",

    "text": "We came here for our anniversary. The service was excellent. Our waitress brought rose petals to the table and took the time to explain the menu. She recommended the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-Year Aged Balsamic. At first I thought, \"of course you would recommend the most expensive item on the menu, but what the heck. It's my anniversary!\" Let me tell you, it was the most phenomenal steak I've ever eaten. I'm talking melt-in-your-mouth delicious. On top of that - it was huge! We ordered crab cakes as an appetizer and they also had a very good flavor. She also brought out two complimentary desserts for us. The cheesecake was better than any other I've had. Rich, creamy, and perfect. The only \"downside\" is the price but if you're saving up for a special occasion then it's worth it. The price can very easily reach $100 per person but I haven't found better food anywhere else. I can't speak highly enough of how delicious this place is.",

    "text": "Love the personalization! We arrived with only half our party, but we were seated and brought starter cocktails right away. Everyone (even the waiter) greeted my husband by name as we were seated (he made the reservation). I was suitably impressed.   The decor is top notch, muted and cozy lighting, just all around very pleasing.   Food is great, as is should be for how expensive this place is. I ordered the truffle fries because I heard how great they were, but they were nothing special.   My only complaint was that the ladies bathroom was dirty, i.e. towels and toilet paper all over the floor and in all the stalls. I thought that in a classy place such as this that they'd have someone keeping an eye on them, but it looked like they had not been cared for in a couple days.",

    "text": "This has always been our favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. My husband and I dined here last night for Valentine's Day. In the past, we always received superb service. However, our first server last night was horrible. There was heart confetti on the table and I received a red rose (my husband requested this), but the server took her time coming to our table. She had another large group and was clearly rushed. She did not place the napkin in our laps. When I asked her about this, she balked and informed me that she was not trained to do that. Not only do servers place the napkin in your lap, they match the napkin to your slacks, skirt or dress. When I told her this, she snapped, \"Do you want another server?\" We said yes. This was a special dinner for us and the restaurant is expensive, but worth the price for exceptional food and service. Thankfully, Koy stepped in as our server, and he was incredible. Our first server should be fired. She alone will ruin the reputation of this wonderful restaurant.",

The quality of the food is the best in the business, and our server was knowledgeable about everything on the menu, including the color of the beef we would get based on how we wanted it done. Great service speed as well. It is expensive, but anything that's the best of the best is expensive.",

    "text": "I went here for the first time on Saturday night. We had an 8:45 reservation and were seated upon arrival. The decor is elegant and I was excited.  My excitement was short lived as it took 40 minutes, not an exaggeration, to get our drinks. We were also seated in area where the wait staff continuously placed dirty dishes. I was beginning to think this was a big mistake, but when our food arrived, i knew my disappointment was going to change. I ordered the roasted chicken and au gratin potatoes and my meal was excellent. The chicken was tender, juicy, and had just the right amount of seasoning. The au gratin potatoes were creamy. My boyfriend had the aged del monico, sam's mashed potatoes, and scallops. His steak was tender and seasoned to perfection. We finished dinner with cheesecake and coconut creme pie. Needless to say, the food here is excellent. I only gave four stars because I would expect better service from a high end restaurant.",

    "text": "This is a good steakhouse.  It's mostly what you would expect if you've been to this type of place in other cities.  I do like that they tailor the art to reflect the local history.  The bartenders are excellent.  I especially like Seth.  Unlike Mortons and Ruth Chris the bar is a lot of fun.  The crowd is similiar to the other steak places, but seem to me to be a bit younger.  The steaks are what you'd expect and they are excellent.  However, and this may just be my personal opinion I'd stay away from some of the exotic preparations (like coffee beans) and just stick with a good piece of meat.  I really liked the spinach.  They put just the right amount of nutmeg to give it an interesting taste.  The other sides are about average.  If I had to rank these steak places I mentioned in this review I'd have to say the Capital Grille is the current favorite.  I'd like to find a local place that is on par with these franchises, since I'd much prefer to support local business owners.",
