Also they will cater to you. I always get an extra burrito and both beans and fajitas.  Food: I am super glad they are now offering sofritias (tofu) for us veg heads! Before it was either meat or get a burrito with just veggies. They food always taste spot on. The only problem I have is when you bite into the burrito sometimes it's just a gob of sour cream, others it's just a dry rice bed.   Location: I am particularly fond of this location due to the elevated entrance, which allows for outside seating. The parking is somewhat funky as its on a slanted hill, but there's always room.",

And it sat in my stomach for hours.   Steve Ells' \"Food With Integrity\" mission statement is laudable as is his goal to provide fare that is organic, fresh, handmade, and sustainable.   However, there's just something missing from whatever I've eaten at a Chipotle. Even their guacamole, which ain't bad, just lacks pizzazz.   That burrito filled me up, though, and that's about all it did.   $25 for chips, guac, a burrito, and a \"bowl\" for Kay. I don't know if it was worth it.   Dig that funky, futuristic, Fritz Lang-ish decor, kids. That's what you're paying for.   It's been said that Ells is \"exacting.\" How I wish the flavors of the food matched his personality.   1500 restaurants, and there's nothin' on.",

There's lots of protein options, and the ingredients are usually pretty fresh and appealing.  Even on super busy days the line moves fairly fast, and with their new pledge to go non-GMO they've added more appeal. But...it just seems hyped up and a little overpriced.  While their chips are good, (love the hint of lime!) they're spendy!  Seriously?  They're tortilla chips!!!  Also, it's noisy.  And often we look at the line and think \"Nope, not worth it\"  The steak and chicken can vary from tender and good to \"Oh yuck, trim your meat better\"  So, do we eat there anyway sometimes?  For sure.  If the kiddos didn't like it so much we would go less often.",

I brought grandma here for her first Chipotle experience and we had to park up the shopping plaza so she could get into the building. There are only steps to the front door! Once we got inside, I quickly realized there was no seating shed be comfortable. There is a long connected cafeteria style table with backed chairs, however, all of those seats were filled...she also didn't want to sit with children or squished in with other customers. The remaining seating was high barstools or low stools. Just wish there was some individual seating with backs, so we could've eaten more comfortably.",

Since then I have been to Chipotle stores in almost every major city in the US.  This location is closest to my home and I have to say it is by far the most poorly run store in terms of quality, consistency, and efficiency.  I have always been impressed with the efficiency of the high volume stores with lines that are always to the door during rush hour.  In these cases, the crews work methodically to get you your food within 10-15 minutes.  At this location, you will get your food within 10-15 minutes if there are just 2 people ahead of you.  If I see a line longer than 5 people, I walk out because I believe I will starve by the time they ring me up at the register.  The food at this location is also variable...it is not uncommon to get rice either over or under cooked or your chicken over or under salted.  I am hoping that upper management makes the necessary corrections to drastically improve this location's overall performance...I want this store to do well as it has the potential to be an anchor tenant at this strip mall for decades to come.  Plus, it's only minutes from my house!",

Ok full disclosure-i consider myself a chipolte connoisseur and eat here probably twice a week bc they have salad bowls with no gluten. This one consistently gives us the tiniest waste of money bowls.  You can always tell when a new person is hired bc they fill the spoon then proceed to shake 75% off. By the time you get your bowl with the newbies, it's about a 1/4 cup of everything and you finish it thinking \"wait. Did i just pay $10 to still be starving?!\"  This place has a lot of newbies thus the reason for this review. When my 5 yr old who eats like a bird, eats his whole bowl and says mum I'm still hungry....you know you got ripped off here. I hAd to order another bowl for him. $20 for one kid!! Insane!  As we left i heard an old \"90lb soaking wet\" lady say \"sweety I'm not paying all this money to eat five pieces of rice. What you have there won't fill me up\".....i laughed and yelled AMEN TO THAT!  Quality control chipolte.  That's where it's at. But for this place i will say that's where it's NOT at!  Avoid this newbie who gives such a small amount of rice etc that it doesn't even fill the BOTTOM of the bowl....otherwise be prepared to spend double",

    "text": "This is the location we frequently go to when craving Chipotle.  They were training a few new employees that night, but the service was still prompt and friendly.   I got a drink, a single taco, and a side of guac with chips.  My son got a quesadilla meal with rice, black beans, blueberries, and chocolate milk.   The facility was clean and not too busy.   I will mention that there was an option to take a survey on my receipt and one of the workers gave me a coupon for free chips and guac as an incentive to take the survey.  I noticed afterwards that the coupon expired a month ago.  Woops!    Overall the visit was great!",

    "text": "A-OK is what this Chiplotle is.  The food is very good, as at most Chipotles, in my opinion.  This one is a bit weird due to its layout.  It is decent sized but somehow seems to not have enough seats.  This place can get hammered, with a line out the door, and this is not the quickest Chipotle (but not the slowest either), so expect a good wait if the line is long.  The dining room is relatively clean, as is the drinks area.  Overall, it's pretty good but not special or amazing, so three-starts is right on.",

    "text": "Use to be a Chipotle guy but I think I've converted to Moes.  The quality and quantity I think is now better at Moes (it kills me to say that).    Past few times going to Chipotle my chicken has been chewy and either my wife or my rice isn't cooked enough.  It's not the most pleasant meal when you're trying to chew and you keep crunching on hard or chewy items in your bowl.  Another item that made me switch to Moes is the quantity they give you - Chipotle has been skimping on the amount of rice they give you.  I've had to ask for more rice because they barely put any in.  On the other side Moes I think I've almost asked them to take some out because of the amount they give you.  Free chips and a $2 dollar off receipt for next time trumps Chipotle's over priced chips and quac",

The food quality (undercooked rice, undercooked chicken [seriously, the stuff I just had was brown on the outside and raw in the center]) has nosedived and the staff is completely apathetic. Sadly, I think after today's latest disappointment, we will be driving a little further to a different location. Such a bummer.",
