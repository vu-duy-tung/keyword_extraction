    "text": "Upon arrival, the atmosphere of the restaurant was quiet and welcoming. I loved the large Asian style umbrellas hanging from the ceiling in different tiers. My boyfriend and I went to this place as he'd been before and enjoyed the food. I ordered the General Tso's chicken as I was starving and ready to maul a plate of food. I ordered first, and as Joe ordered his food, he asked for white meat chicken. \"Why ask for white meat chicken? This place charges $15 for an entree,\" I thought to myself. Well, indeed a place can charge whatever the hell they want per plate and still use chicken cuts I wouldn't put in my own dishes at home. I realized the meat in my order was dark, gummy, and stringy, however I figured I'd muddle through it and enjoy the crisp and sauce. I made it about a third of the way through my dish before encountering a gooey, gummy, ball of fat. I chewed until I thought I could stomach the bite, swallowed, and nearly gagged as part went down my throat and part was stuck on the back of my tongue.  I immediately felt sick to my stomach and the server, who I gathered may have been an owner, asked me if everything was alright. He was very sweet and attentive, so I didn't have the heart to tell him the General Tso's (standard order) had me on the verge of regurgitating my entire meal. I'm glad we had hot tea and that I had some wonton soup as an appetizer. Can I also mention there was shredded lettuce (not cabbage or the asian slaw) in my soup? Literally; shredded lettuce from a Subway sandwich should not be stewing in my bowl of soup.  I was happy my wonton soup was tepid at best, as it was easy to eat, but after I imagined what the chicken likely looked like before they battered and fried it, I thought to myself that the soup was likely under-temperature for what is passable by the ACHD.  I'd love to go back, but my stomach turns as I'm typing this review. Give it a shot, but if ordering something with chicken, by all means, request that it is White Meat. When they tell you \"oh that's the amazing chicken\" you'll know that the other type they serve is actually the pig slop.",

    "text": "I just moved to the North Hills and had always greatly enjoyed the Sesame Inn in Mt. Lebanon.  I decided to order take out from this location and the issues started from the moment they picked up the phone. For starters, the woman who answered asked me several times if I knew what location I was ordering from. I did not understand what she was saying due to the language barrier and tried to be very polite, however her growing irritation and blatant rudeness was overwhelming. The few questions I asked were met with aggression.   When I went to pick it up, the location was hard to find. It is virtually in a Toyota dealership. The entrance and ambiance is very chic. I picked up my food and asked the woman helping me if the chicken and broccoli was in a brown sauce. She did not initially respond at all and said a minute later that it was. I asked for extra soy sauce, which apparently irritated her as well. When I got home and opened my bag there were NO soy sauce packets and 2 duck sauces. Good thing I asked for \"extra\" or I would have had none. The chicken was goupy and chewy; not up to the standard I was used to from the Lebo location. I do not need to feel intimidated when paying for food and will not be going back.",

However, recently I was there with a beautiful lady and did not want to embarrass myself by ordering something like General Tso's chicken, so I went out on a shaky limb and ordered the Pad Thai. Yes, I understand Pad Thai is like the Beatles of Thai food. However, I thought that played right into the Sesame Inn's hand. How do you mess up Pad Thai? Well, I can answer my own question. Firstly, they never asked for a spice level. That was because there were no spices whatsoever. The pile of noodles and thin strips of chicken were an insult to chickens and Thai people in general. Don't get me wrong,  I still love their American Chinese. It is like going to a fancy McDonald's and I love McDonald's. But in all honesty, what a way to waste 12 bucks. Or maybe it was 14. God, I hope it wasn't 14.",

Service is generally very good.  I particularly enjoy the soup dumplings and salt and pepper calamari.  This is the best calamari I have ever had.  It tastes fresh and appears hand breaded.  Far better than the frozen, chewy junk that places like Olive Garden serve.     I must point out that this is Americanized Chinese/Thai dishes.  Although, the Amazing Chicken is pretty amazing.  The tangy spicy scallops and shrimp are also great!  If I don't order one of these two dishes, I generally order sushi.  I would say they serve average sushi.  Some days it's great, and other days it's just ok.  If you're looking for something fresher and tastier than your local Chinese take out spot, this is the way to go!",

On our recent visit we noticed this locally known \"Chinese\" restaurant now serves Chinese, Thai, Japanese, sushi, and more. You can't be good at it all, and Sesame Inn proves that. Our meal was $50 for a kid and two adults. The kids menu serves fries and chicken fingers (at a Chinese restaurant). I have spent a lot of time in China and Thailand and the food reminds me of a cheap greasy buffet. Just look at the amount of oil and grease in the curry picture I posted. I will tell you, my stomach was in knots and did flips for days. I had to drain the grease out of each bite. My partner's dish had so much salt in it and it spiked her already high blood pressure. Maybe the chef dropped a box of salt in by accident. Another issue was our service. The guy must've had PMS. He was so irritated and never checked to see how our meal was. He was snapping and didn't seem to want to be there. On a previous visit he was nice. Maybe he also doesn't like it anymore. This place is robbing people dry. Find another restaurant fast! Don't waste your money! Or kill your stomach or waist line! Any health concerns? Don't dine here. I'm sad to say our family has been coming here for years but just ended our memories dining here.",

I don't always go with my \"stand bys\" as I like to try new foods so I've not always liked what I've had there, but in general, it's a pretty solid place.  A few years ago, I held a wedding shower in their banquet room and they didn't disappoint!  As with every experience I had there, the portions were large and the service was excellent.  I haven't tried enough of a variety of their sushi, but the rolls I did try there were fresh and well-prepared.    My one caveat is this: If you're looking to go and have a few alcoholic beverages, bring your gold card because their libations can get pricey in comparison to the other restaurants in the North Hills.",

I agree with the other reviewer, you prob can get the Americanized chinese cuisine for cheaper at a hole-in-the-wall take-out place for cheaper but you're paying for the ambience (which is similar to pf change). 4 star since the food is good and the price isn't bad.

I was not upset but we wanted to call and notify they restaurant in case others had similar issues. No, instead we were told to go to the hospital and get checked out and if it was food poisoning then they have insurance to cover. No sorry. No apologies. Just talk to our insurance company.

I recommend the lighter fare options (reportedly less sodium, no MSG, and sauce on the side).  Most of the dishes are mild - request extra spice if you like it hot. The meats are of typical Chinese restaurant quality (i.e. questionable).  The staff is on point.    Overall an elegant dining experience to contrast the North Hills' suburban sprawl.",

There were 7 of us so I called & made reservations- we walked in at 3:55 and were promptly seated at a table set up & waiting for us.  Our waitress brought over menus (I hate when they are already placed on the table before you even get there).  As we were looking it over, a server came around with 2 pots of the complimentary tea and filled our water glasses.  We ordered after a few minutes and sat back & waited...  In probably less than 5 minutes, out come our egg rolls and the Octopus salad we ordered as apps.  The egg rolls were cooked to perfection- the outer shell was as delicate as a spring roll and the inside vegetables still had that crunch.  The chicken egg rolls were devoured before I could get a good look but we ordered another one so they must have been pretty good.  It was me that had ordered the octopus salad and while it wasn't prepared the way I was used to- slightly pickled, left in bigger pieces- this was still nice & fresh octopus with crunchy veggie strings interspersed in a subtle cream type sauce.  That was my only :( in the whole meal and who am I to tell them how to prepare octopus salad...?    Our entrees came out & they were huge.  My wife ordered Happy Family, I ordered Vegetable Lo Mein (we normally share 2 plates), my dad (who has a very limited grasp on oriental cuisine) played it safe with chicken strips & white rice,my mo ordered Amazing Chicken and my sons ordered Amazing Chicken, Chicken Lo Mein & General Tso's Shrimp.  The Amazing Chicken was my fav of the day.  It had the most delicate breading on it with a slight tangy sauce (reminded me of General Tso's sweetness mixed with the tanginess of Duck Sauce).  There wasn't a single sliver of amazing chicken to put into a to go box.  We ended up splitting our (my wife & mine) leftovers and made 2 work lunches.    Then at the end of our meal, because I had told the waitress we were celebrating my son's b/d, she brought out a comp. piece of cheesecake with a candle on it and started the Happy Birthday song.  She didn't have to, but that was a very nice touch on their part.    We've been to a bunch of Chinese restaurants in the area and I think this one gets my vote as the best.  Even over P. F. Changs who some people thing is awesome, my experience is that their food is 'boil-in-a-bag' and pour out onto your plate.  Their sweet & sour chicken was cold & mushy...                 So, in closing... we are DEFINATELY fans if the Sesame Inn just off McKnight Road.  :)",

Furthermore, the food was not authentic Chinese at all. We ordered one whole Peking Duck but it wasn't even close to the Peking Duck I've had in Philadelphia, D.C., and China! It was honestly my first time trying something other than the mixed vegetables and general Tso's chicken but it was again quite disappointing.

    "text": "Definitely not a fan of this place.  The food is okay--typical \"americanized Chinese,\" like you'd get at a takeout place, but overpriced.  I went most recently on a Sunday morning for brunch with some friends, and they all ordered off the brunch menu.  I could not, because they would not make any vegetarian substitutions and the waiter made fun of me for not wanting chicken.  I had to order from the regular menu and wait through their first two courses for my food, which was just okay.  The decor is faux fancy--but there is visible water damage on the ceiling and walls, and they just don't quite pull it off.  If you live really close, I could see that you might go here for Chinese but otherwise I would skip it.  There are many better options that are more reasonably priced in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "Lets be honest, there isnt many half decent Chinese food in Pittsburgh or even Asian food in general.  Also, it pains me to rate a Chinese restaurant that also serves Thai cuisine and Sushi. Its just not right and usually when a restaurant tries to do too many thing at once, they end up sucking at everything.  With that said, Sesame Inn actually has decent Americanized Chinese food, their Thai food is not bad and the sushi is always fresh. And because Pittsburgh is severely lacking in Asian restaurants, I'll give Sesame Inn a pass for doing Chinese, Thai and Japanese (which in normal circumstances screams for me to stay away from).  My favorite thing on the menu is the Singapore Rice noodles. Its a curry flavored noodle dish with chicken, pork and shrimp that makes me crave for more each time I order it.",

When we headed to Pittsburgh again last weekend I had to get back there even though I was beyond exhausted from the 11 hour drive.  There was a 30 min wait, which we weren't in the mood for, so we sat at the bar.  The bartender was super friendly and our food was out in a flash.  Best part - it was just as great as the last time we had it.  Even though we love the usual suspects when visiting Pitt - this is my #1 must go to.  Note:  the two times we went were at two different locations.  The one at the mall was situated really weird.  You feel like you're driving into a car dealer.  I prefer the atmosphere of the one near GreenTree - sorry, I can't remember the name of the town - but they're both great.",

The interior is a bit dated and could use a bit of a refresh.  Also, the entrance is a great place for kids to pick up rocks and pound them while parents watch.  We were greeted and seated right away.  White table clothes are a nice touch.  Our server was great.  BJ ordered off the Sunday Brunch menu which is really a great deal.  All of the options are between 11 and 13 bucks and include appetizer, soup and beverage.  Of course, he was getting beer, not included, so I got his drink.  He got Triple Delight with beef, chicken and shrimp with vegetables in brown sauce.  So good!  I got my usual General Tso Shrimp, it was very good.  All in all, a great experience.  It's a place we will visit again and again.",

    "text": "I've been going to Sesame Inn for years, and it is definitely my favorite place in the North Hills for Chinese, and really one of the top 5 places I've had for Chinese period.  The menu has expanded a bit over the years, now containing some sushi and Thai dishes.  Personally, I'd stick to the Chinese food.  One of my favorite dishes is the Walnut Shrimp, which also comes as a chicken option.  Candied walnuts along with battered and fried chicken or shrimp (not a health food I'm sure...) doused in a brown sweet, but a little spicy, sauce.  If you're not sure what to order or are not super adventurous, this is a great dish to start with.  I've yet to meet a person who doesn't like it.  The other entree I order regularly is the Chicken with Garlic Sauce, which is a bit of a healthier option.  Sauteed chicken with numerous vegetables including broccoli, water chestnuts, onions, and baby corns in a garlic, somewhat spicy, sauce.  All of their entrees are HUGE, so come hungry, plan to split with someone, or leave with your lunch for the next day.  Their egg rolls are also amazing, and the duck sauce and spicy mustard they serve with them are delicious.  The spicy mustard will definitely clean out your sinuses if used in a moderate or large quantity!  The service is always friendly and helpful.  Most of their staff has been working here since I was a wee one, so they have to be doing something right!  The atmosphere is a classy Chinese restaurant with white table clothes, sometimes glowing candles or flowers, and fancy folding cloth napkins.  Not a bad place for a date or business dinner.  The only odd thing about the atmosphere, which has improved over the years, is the general location.  It shares a building with a car dealer's repair shop so from the outside it doesn't really scream fine dining, but keep on walking in and I guarantee you'll be pleasantly surprised.  My only beef with Sesame Inn is that years ago they discontinued my favorite appetizer, the Pu Pu platter.  I only put this fact in this review as a longshot attempt at getting it reinstated.   Overall, definitely a gem in the North Hills and a place that I will be surely dining at for years to come!",

They have an impressive menu with the expected entrees, sushi and even a section of Thai dishes. Not a huge selection of Specialty sushi rolls, but they definitely have quality ingredients. Two of my favorite dishes were the Walnut Chicken and the Ginger Chicken.  The portions are huge, so you have a great chance of having some delicious left-overs!

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Sunday morning for a birthday brunch with 6 other members of my family.  I have eaten food from the Sesame Inn before but have never actually been to the restaurant.  We arrived at around 11:40 to find both sets of doors open and proceeded to head into the restaurant.  Once there we were greeted by the hostess who told us that the restaurant did not open until noon.  Since we were already there we decided to wait out in the lobby/sunroom type area.  It was actually quite a nice area that was decorated brightly with plants and some spacious seats.  At around 11:50 we were told that they were now ready for us and that we could sit inside.  The inside of the restaurant is just as nice as the lobby area was and had some large windows, birds of paradise flowers and some nice decorating.  The lights seemed to be embedded in what looked like large umbrellas and I thought that it gave the restaurant a nice feel.  For my entree I decided to go with the Mongolian Chicken, extra spicy.  Since it was Sunday, there was also a brunch option on the menu which gave the option of 4 popular dishes that would also be served with soup, salad or egg roll, the entree and a soft drink (no free refills on them if received from brunch).  Everyone else at the table ordered a brunch menu item except for me and within a short time there were all served their egg rolls and soup.  Thankfully for me, my cousin is not a big fan of soup and so I was able to get him to order hot and sour soup for me.  The soup came out hot, was very tasty and I enjoyed it.  I have to admit that I was pretty jealous of the egg rolls that everyone else got as well as they were absolutely humongous.  After everyone had finished the starters our meals came out.  They served the white rice accompaniment family style in a huge bowl.  My Mongolian Chicken came with bamboo shoots, scallion, onion and dried hot peppers all mixed together.  The chicken was moist and tasted pretty good and I was happy that they made it my dish fairly spicy like I had asked.  I ended up added a little rice to the dish and by the time I was finished eating I was completely stuffed.  The bottom line for me is that I would head to the Sesame Inn again in the future.  It costs a bit more than some of the Chinese restaurants in the area but you are paying for the quality.  This was easily seen in the size and stuffing of the egg rolls and also in the wonton soup which had a decent amount of scallions and thin strips of pork in it.",

Even when a mistake is made by them, like forgetting the egg roll on a delivery order, they refuse to take care of it claiming they delivered the egg roll and you're lying about it. After years of not patronizing them because of that, I started ordering from them again. Once a week in fact. I forgot an entree when I made my initial order and didn't realize until my food was delivered. They wouldn't allow me to order it for delivery unless I ordered something else to get it over $20. Forget the almost $50 order I just got. Now I'm done. They're food isn't even that good, but they were better than the only other Chinese restaurant that would deliver. I won't give anymore of my hard earned money to these jerks.",

I had the sushi lunch with 2 maki rolls. The California roll and shiitake mushroom rolls were wonderful. The hot and sour soup was decent. My daughter had the chicken and broccoli, which she didn't like but I did. My dad did not like the general tso chicken. He thought it was too sweet. My grandma had the amazing chicken, which was almost the same thing as his.    The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. The entrance way is welcoming.",

I'm not sure if something has changed with the ownership, the chef, food supplier etc but it hasn't been good. I had General Tso chicken for lunch with brown rice ..the sauce was bland and had a weird flavor I couldn't pinpoint..almost a fishy flavor..the other dish was chicken with broccoli in own sauce with brown rice...same thing an odd flavor almost sour. Very different from what we have experienced in the past..we mentioned this to our server, and he indicated he had heard similar feedback from other diners today and that he would tell the chef. We ate a third of our plates and asked for the check. Don't think we are going back here again.",

When you enter, there is a large lobby area with Chinese decor.  The dining area itself is in two tiers.  The lower tier which includes the sushi bar and the upper tier which provides a \"view\" (I say \"view\" because you overlook a parking lot and McKnight Road).    We went early on a Friday evening.  There were still several tables empty but the hostess took a bit of time deciding where to seat us.  I'm not sure if they take reservations but perhaps some of the tables were reserved and they just didn't mark them.  I enjoy that the menu has both sushi and chinese items.  I love sushi and was excited to order a roll as an appetizer.  I had the spicy tuna and my husband had a california roll.  Both were decent.  Not the best sushi I've ever had, but the fish seemed fresh and there was a lot of flavor.  It was tough trying to decide which entree to get since there were so many choices.  I had the Bride and Groom dish.  I enjoyed the flavor but I disliked the size and texture of the meat pieces.  They were pretty large and not that easy to cut or chew.  Not something I'd order again.  Overall a decent meal, but not a place I would go out of my way to return to.",

Any time you come, you see hoards of people just waiting for takeout orders. I've had the orange chicken, sesame chicken, and lemon chicken. All are delicious. I've also had the spicy tuna roll, crab rangoons, steamed dumplings, wonton soup and seaweed salad. All of them hit the spot!   Sesame Inn is very consistent in their quality and the restaurant is much more fancy inside than you'd expect from a Chinese place. It is a great addition to anyone's usual dining spots.",

Ex) Today my wife and I ordered dinner @ 5:43 @ 7:18pm I called them asking them - where is the food? The manager proceeded to tell us the driver drove the our place and the lights were off and no one answered the door - he asked did you guys leave and just come back???? I told him Noooo - we have two lights on - one in the yard and one above the front door. I said the driver must of went to the wrong place. The manager tells me noooo the driver went to my address??? I'm like dude - I've been sitting here binge watching Netflix waiting for food with my wife. What a a$$. Anyway we say well can he come back and how long will it be now? He tells us 30 minutes.... it's already been 90 minutes. We tell him to cancel the order - what a pain - ridiculous. Beware of the delivery... go pick it up. Now starving and in a terrible mood.

Walking in, I found that the restaurant itself is very clean and presentable - first hurdle cleared! I was very impressed with the variety of vegetarian options they offered on the menu as well. We came in right in time for their lunch specials, so I ordered the lunch sushi option where you choose 2 rolls and a soup. I went with the garden roll and the tamago roll - both were great! Standard sushi quality, but with the low price, it was a fantastic deal. My boyfriend ordered the General Tso's Chicken which was very crispy and the sauce was flavorful without being too sweet or sour. The food earns our seal of approval!   If I needed a reason to love this place even more, the waiter provided the best customer service. He was very friendly, attentive, and delivered our food and drinks very quickly. I couldn't have asked for better service.  I will definitely be back! Sesame Inn, I will see you at my next oil change!",

And when I pushed for a refund, the manager told me that he was sure the entree was cooked and put in the bag, implying that we did receive the missing order and were lying.   Needless to say, we will not be ordering from this restaurant again. Very poor customer service and even worse managerial oversight. Plus, the food was mediocre at best.",

It can be a little pricey but I say it's worth the money! The restaurant is located in a parking lot next to a car place, it is a little confusing at first but once you drive right by the car place you will see the restaurant and all of its places to park.

Sesame Inn is a lot nicer than your typical neighborhood Chinese restaurant.   I started with a bowl of hot and sour soup which was very good. Some places make theirs too sweet and others make it too hot. This was the perfect balance of both. As my entree I got the sesame chicken which I wasn't all that impressed with but that is only because I'm not a huge fan of dark meat. I did however try my friends amazing chicken and the name is very fitting. The amazing chicken had just the right amount of breaking. It was not loaded with fried breaking like a lot of other Chinese places. It was also made with white meat which I like a lot better. The only complaint I would have is the price. It is about double the price of your local Chinese restaurant so be prepared to spend $15-20 on a entree.   Ambiance: 4 Food/Drink quality: 4 Presentation: 3 Price: 3 Overall: 4",

The Kung Pao was a 5/10.   The Amazing Duo was somewhat enjoyable but still wasn't as sweet as I would have liked and some of the chicken was rubbery.   The Kung Pao Duo was very, very bland. It wasn't spicy, and it wasn't savory or flavorful, even though it had celery, peanuts, and mushrooms in it. By the way, it had way too much peanuts and celery. These are supposed to complement this dish, not be a main component. I would have told the waiter about the taste, but I had started eating my wife's meal first before and he came over to check on us before I had mine. I ate a little bit of mine over the course of the night, but my wife and I practically finished hers. I told the waiter at the end of the meal how bland mine was while he was packing it up. He went and had the cook \"spice\"  it up before putting it into the to go box. Trying it at home, it's still bland and maybe spiced from a 0 to a 1 lol. The waiter did give us free white rice to take home to eat with our leftovers.   All in all, I would not eat here again, especially for the price ($18 per meal dinner) and lack of taste and quality. I would rather spend my money at Nikkis Thai Kitchen (yes, it's not Chinese, but the quality is outstanding and it's a favorite restaurant of mine.)",

Normally, 95% of the time, our meals and service have been great, but not this time. Appetizers were typically terrific, won ton, dumplings, egg rolls all great. However, my wife's shrimp dish was was littered with uncleaned shrimp, at least half of them had dark veins and were un-edible. We did pick them out and they replaced them but what an unappetizing unappealing presentation. Simply put, THEY DID NOT CLEAN AND PREPARE THEIR FOOD WITH PROFESSIONALISM, CARE, OR THOUGHT. I had one of my usual favorites, Seafood supreme, which was bland and had only about 50% of the usual stock of ingredients; 3 shrimp (usually 6-8), 3 half pieces of mushy scallops (usually at least 5-6 whole big scallops), and one piece of fish (usually 3-4 in the dish). Needless to say we were disappointed in these atypically under par dishes. Service was also under par. I approached the manager as we were leaving and told him of the situation, and this is what really irked me...he was completely indifferent to my polite complaints. I wasn't asking for the total bill to be disguarded, but a gesture from him/them to maybe take one dishes cost off the bill would have gone a long way to us remaining loyal customers. They failed and the manager's complete apathy was disgraceful and disrespectful. Shame on them. Highly unlikely we'll ever return, and that's  a shame because it was really our go to place for weekly night out and special occasions with our entire family. The complete disregard for a customer is appalling on so many levels. The Sesame Inn at the North Hills location has gone from A+++ to a D-.",

But I feel like the sesame chicken my hubby got and my sweet and sour chicken were a bit oversauced. And the sweet potato roll was sweet potato fries wrapped up like sushi, eh. The hubby did like the wonton soup. The fried rice was good.  Overall, average. I would come back for the Rangoons. But we are not in a hurry to come back.",

But hey -- Adds to the character of the place. The interior is very nice and the staff is friendly.  I almost always order the Amazing Chicken because... wait for it... it's AMAZING. It's all lean white meat chicken, breaded and magicked by some sorcerer. Then it's doused with a sweet sauce for extra amazingness. There is definitely more than enough for lunch the next day. The serving sizes are jumbo.  The sushi and maki rolls are really great too. The last time I ate here I ordered the sweet potato maki roll, which is a vegetarian roll made with fried sweet potato, avocado, and cream cheese. AND IT WAS SO GOOD. So so so so good. So. Good.   They also offer some Thai dishes. I've tried a couple and they are ok if you're in the mood for Thai, but I always go back to that Amazing Chicken. Yum!",

It's definitely worth the trip and I haven't found any Chinese food better elsewhere. It truly a beautiful interior, robust with umbrellas on the ceiling and lights for the mood.

Each time a pleasant experience!  Plenty of seating, great service, great food!     I do find the location a bit odd but the dining experience makes you forget that it's attached to a Toyota dealership.   We had Mai Tai's from the bar - also crazy good!

I called to ask about this and was rudely informed that chow mein does not come with noodles. When I pointed out that chow mein not only should come with noodles but translates into, literally, \"Fried NOODLES\", the person on the phone got beligerant. He informed me that they have been in business for over 20 years and in that 20 years, THEIR chow mein has never had noodles. He told me that I should have known that and that if I did not know what chow mein was, I should have asked. I pointed out that I DID know what chow mein should be and what they gave me was NOT chow mein. He told me that it was their version of chow mein and it was my fault for not knowing that I should have asked if their version was real chow mein.  Throughout the entire conversation, he kept blaming me for expecting something other than what they chose to give me. He insisted that because it is a Chinese restaurant, I could not possibly know what I was ordering and therefore it was my fault.  Throughout the conversation, he was incredibly rude. 1. He erroneously made the assumption that I was unfamiliar with Chinese food. 2. He refused to acknowledge that mein means noodle (even though he said that lo mein has noodles). 3. He screamed at me for the entire conversation. 4. He scolded me for screaming back at him. Hypocrite! 5. He told me that it was my responsibility to come back and get it changed. 6. When explaining that something called fried noodles does not have noodles he used an example from another dish. He informed me that they have a sauce that they call \"garlic sauce\" that contains no garlic. This sounds like a lot of False advertising going on!",

    "text": "We were on McKnight Road running a few errands Friday night and were eager to try somewhere new. With a Chinese craving, we found Sesame Inn on yelp and were on our way! And I am so glad we found it!  In full transparency - the only reason I am docking a star is because there is a lingering scent of gasoline throughout the entire restaurant that obviously comes from its word location - attached to a car dealership. However, just get inside and the ambiance makes you forget all that! (Except the smell, which was something my dining partner didn't notice but I certainly did.)  What I loved about Sesame Inn is that there are few Asian cuisine restaurants that offer a nicer dining experience with a full bar, great ambiance, and attentive service. Though we did not drink, it was nice to have that option.   I started with an order of the shrimp tempura roll as I wanted to try sushi from their open sushi bar. This was an excellent way to kick off the meal. So tasty!   We each then ordered their sesame chicken, which I've had at almost every Chinese restaurant I've ever been to. This was some of the best! However, it definitely had a sweeter base than some others. If this is your thing, though, you would love it. The chicken came on a massive platter and I ate less than half my serving!   We both agreed we would love to go back and appreciated the small details that made this a lovely dinner experience.",

I finally the small cup rapidly. For the man course, I ordered my favorite Chinese dish: the Peking Duck. I first tried this dish in Beijing, China. Then, found mentions to it in the medieval Persian literature as a fancy food! This time, the Peking duck was delicious too.

The trick is... go early on Saturday afternoon- no wait. You can make a reservation. Perfect for the whole family. (Total of 9 of us) Including my nieces and nephew.   To start, I ordered the Wonton Soup. It is delicious- plenty of big wontons. Next, I ordered a California roll to be shared with the table. Their California roll is amazing - my favorite place to grab some sushi.   For my entree, I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken (with an up charge of $1 for brown rice) this meal is one of the favorites. I also often order the Amazing Chicken - it is also to die for.   The service that we had was amazing. Our waitress was so patient while the kids ordered their food and she was so friendly. She literally made the dinner experience even better.   As always, we had a great family outing to the Sesame Inn.",

Everything is delicious and the portions are huge. Went with a party of 7 and we ordered egg rolls(chicken and vegetable), dumplings, chicken with garlic sauce(my personal favorite), general tso's shrimp and Chicken, beef with brocolli, and fried rice. Even with 7 people we were able to have left overs. Highly recommend if you're looking for good Chinese!",

There is a sushi bar area and regular seating. I love good service, and I feel they were very kind and cool; the atmosphere is calm and inviting.  Ok, so I have actually been there on several different occasions, to dine in and for take out. The Amazing Chicken is good. Fresh white meat chicken, cooked to perfection...not too dry. But my addiction is the chicken lo mein and chicken egg roll. It is so delicious. I have a hard time eating other restaurants lo mein now after this. So, it is a must try!!!!  And again, I love the chicken eggrolls. The shrimp eggrolls are good as well but it is a spring roll with a lighter crust. But still tasty! This is a good date night place, girls night out, or in my case...cheat night after the gym.",

Actually argued with one of our group members about her order.  It seems that he doesn't like big groups.  Tonight was horrible service, as he forgot to bring 4 of us our sushi orders.  I went to ask the manager about it, who said they had a new sushi chef who was slow.  Interestingly, our sushi arrived not long after, so I'm guessing our waiter forgot about it.  To end the evening, one of our group was paying in cash and gave enough to cover her bill, telling him to keep the change, planning to leave addition money on the table for him.  But he came back, telling her that she didn't have enough money to pay the bill.  I've never seen a waiter ask for a tip.  The food is great, but we won't go back to this one again.",

It's not a stereotypical hole in the wall take out place, and it's not the lame-imitation of PF Chang's either...it's genuine Chinese food in a nice restaurant.   The lunch menu for the Inn is good, but you would be better served dropping by for dinner--that's when they break out the really good stuff. Featured on their menu is: the \"amazing\" chicken, Peking duck, half-moon duck, some other kind of duck, lots of other kinds of chicken, plenty of rice dishes, lamb, and all sorts of other dishes that I haven't tried yet, including a \"taste of Thai\" menu, and some sushi. So far, everything that I HAVE tried has been delicious.  Besides the main entrees, there are several good appetizers, including vegan ones, soups and salads, and the very excellent salt-and-pepper bean curd. The desserts are decent too.  The look of the place is amazing! It's a wide open restaurant with plenty of space, and a very zen kind of ambiance. The lobby is visually exciting as well. Every time I eat there, I feel very calm, which probably has something to do with the super-chill music they play--you know that twangy, ubiquitous music that seems to play in basically every store and restaurant these days? yeah, they don't play that here, so you can actually enjoy your food =]  ~other neato things~ *there is always a pot of delicious, steaming hot tea waiting for you at the table, and it's constantly refilled.  *the service is very, very good. *children aren't allowed to run around and scream at this place--this happened once when we were there and omg did his parents get chewed out!   The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because I never give any place 5 stars but seriously, it's well worth the money and any fan of Chinese cuisine will enjoy it fer sure.",

I was quite skeptical of Sesame Inn when I first heard about it (oily, MSG-laden sweet and sour chicken? no thanks!), but I was willing to give it a shot.  The restaurant had plenty of parking in their private lot, so I didn't have trouble there.  The restaurant itself is quite aesthetically pleasing with clean floors and tables and an amazingly large umbrella hanging from the ceiling (it's prettier than how I'm describing it).  The service was fast and friendly.  The menu is quite extensive and can be a bit mind-boggling at first.  I went with my sister and she ordered a shrimp and scallop dish while I went for the garlic basil eggplant.  When our plates came, the food was hot and the portions were huge.  For both dishes the sauces were amazing and the food wasn't too greasy or salty.  Although the flavors weren't 100% authentic Chinese, this was definitely a step up from your average take-out/American Chinese place.  If you really want authentic dishes, maybe stop by Rose Tea Cafe in Squirrel Hill, but Sesame Inn by itself is not only a delicious choice but you'll enjoy dining here too.  I will continue to dine here often!",

Service is generally very attentive, and the food, while not remarkably different from cuisine elsewhere, is probably better tasting than almost any comparable restaurant in the area.   They also have a decent selection of sushi. I've had better elsewhere, and I don't necessarily associate the Sesame Inn with sushi, but it's certainly not bad.   In short, I haven't left the Sesame Inn unsatisfied. It is basically my go-to Chinese restaurant while in the North Hills, and it beats out many in the city of Pittsburgh as well.",

This location was odd, sauteed onions and mushrooms covered the  shrimp making them soggy! Extra pepper to them meant course black ground rather then the White pepper the dish calls for, major mistake! I will not come back here, south  hills location does it well.",

    "text": "I want there for lunch on a Monday afternoon, we were seated within 5 minutes, myself my friend and my 4 month old baby. As we say down, after a few minute water's and tea were given to us but nobody greeted us or said they'd be right with us, after 25 minutes I finally asked a waiter who was serving people around us who were eating and had gotten there after us. I jus asked to put an order in to go, was told hed find someone to wait on us. He came back about 5 minutes latet apologizing while I was the only was ordering bc my friend was so pissed she said she wanted nothing. Its not like we blend in either with a fussy 4 month old we kind of can't be missed. The only positive thing was the manager brought my food and said it was in the house and they're sorry but they are busy. Being I'm a server myself, I totally understand a little wait but to be totally ignored and not even greeted? Awful service. I used to order take out all the time from there and will never again.",

The chicken was so delicious and crisp on the outside, yet moist and tasty on the inside! Worth the drive if you are not nearby.",

    "text": "This restaurant is very gorgeous on the inside, and the atmosphere is great for everything from business meetings to family dinners to reunions. The lobby is well decorated, and the setup is very spacious - quite elegant, especially considering the actual building is more difficult to find and located inside a Toyota dealership! The food, however, is entirely Americanized Chinese food. It's not bad, but don't come here expecting to eat authentic Chinese food if you're familiar with it. We ordered the mapo tofu and the garlic eggplant, two staples of vegetarian dining in Americanized Chinese places. The eggplant was decent, as was the brown rice, but the mapo tofu was rather boring, cubes of plain tofu in a generic brown sauce with a small bit of the infamous peas and tiny carrot cubes and mushroom slices that must be frozen/canned from the food distributor. Definitely not a real mapo tofu.  Anyway, the service was decent, so the take-home point is, definitely come here for the nice atmosphere or if you like Americanized Chinese food. Don't come here if you want authentic Chinese - but hey, we're in America, and those places are few and far between, especially in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "My job dispatched me to our North Hills satellite office for the day.  The thing that I hate about this area is it's so car-dependant here.  You have to drive to places two minutes away!  On the other hand, if you're looking for a decent lunch, there are all sorts of good places around here.    I'm a big fan of Chinese food and fortunately one of my favorite places in the 'Burgh, Sesame Inn, has a place nearby.  They have an extensive list of \"Chef's Specials\" for lunch, so if you like good Chinese, you're bound to find something you'll like.  My tastes run to the basics, so I ordered the Lemon Chicken.  The crispy breading on the chicken wasn't overdone (I.e. I could still taste the chicken) and the meat itself was tender.    The lunch specials include your choice of eggroll, hot-n-sour soup, or eggdrop soup.  Now I love my eggrolls and the hot-n-sour soup was mighty tempting.  But it'd been awhile since I'd tried the eggdrop soup and believe me, it really hit the spot.  You also get your choice of steamed, fried, or brown rice.  I'm not a fan of fried rice, so yeah I opted for steamed.    Sesame Inn succeeds at the basics, so if you're in the mood for great, no-surprises Chinese food, then stop in.",
