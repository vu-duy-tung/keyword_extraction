    "text": "A few friends and I ventured out for our first visit to the Urban Tap this past Wednesday. I was pleasantly surprised to be in time for Happy Hour (4.30 -6.30 pm). Before arriving I tried to find details about their happy hour online but failed - it's a definite must for any bar's website. The deal was the standard half off appetizers (excluding the chacuterie and cheese board) and $1 off drafts. Disappointingly there was no cocktail special.   We order a range of appetizers - impressively they were all quite substantial in size! I chose the fried bacon parmesan sprouts and pulled pork sliders. Both were very tasty and came out in a timely fashion. A bowl of the Smoked Gouda Mac was ordered and did not disappoint.  Creamy deliciousness! The sliders were my favorite dish of the night.  The atmosphere and seating were great. There were a variety of seating options (e.g. high-top, bar, or standard tables) and also tables to suit both small and large groups, which is something that I've noticed lacking from many bars in Pittsburgh.  Our waitress was very helpful but it would have been nice if she knew a little more information about the beer selection since it is a Gastro Pub after all.   One notable irritation was the complete lack of prices on the draft and cocktail list. I am not quite sure  about the reason behind this, especially as the waitress could only give the general prices ranges when questioned.  All in all I was very pleased with Urban Tap and it's definitely a great addition to the South Side bar scene. I'll definitely be coming back to try out the rest of their menu.",

It is definitely a by-the-book designed gastropub - dark painted wood, tall and long bar, lots of TVs and kitschy touches. We sat near the windows and checked out the menu - standard gastropub fare - but were really here for the beer. Solid choices, and couple we'd not had, so blood orange and porters and Green Flash IPAs all around. The server was friendly, even when we demurred on ordering food in favor of drinks. A fun place to kill and hour or two over a glass.",

We had to wait over an hour and a half for our burgers and sandwiches, which is a little ridiculous, because how long does it really take to make 4 sandwiches and 1 burger? During this time, our waitress did not come by to check on us. Everybody found the food delicious, and since my chicken sandwich took another 10 minutes and was the last to arrive, they gave me an incredibly huge pile of fries. I appreciate that they tried to make up for the delay of our food with the fries, but would just have prefered our food to be brought to us sooner, since we were all starving and had to buy $1 pierogis from the event as we were waiting.",

    "text": "I really want to rate this one higher, but I just can't do it.  It's on the low end of a 2.5 for me.  Why I want to rate it higher...  It's a great concept and a great space.  Large and open with a rustic industrial vibe.  The front wall of windows opens when the weather is nice and they have a great selection of beers and other drinks.  I was super excited about the Bloody Mary bar; which has potential, but wasn't executed right (see below).  The menu is inventive and the dishes look pretty; but again, are lacking in the execution department.         Why it's down to 2.5 in my book...  For starters, the service.  Yikes!   We reserved for a party of 15, which they accommodated by sticking some tables together and packing 16 chairs in - like sardines.  Good thing two people didn't show up, cause we were on top of each other.  We were also on top of one of the high top tables behind us.  And by on top of, I mean chairs touching, can't get out of your seat close.   This situation also blocked in a corner table, so the guy behind me kept having to get up to let them seat the table and let people out.  Then there were the Bloody Mary's.   It took 30 minutes (not even joking) to get the first round and by then, there was a run on the condiments bar.   The bar part took forever because nothing was labeled and there were no serving spoons other than skewers.  Not sure how you dish out celery salt, horseradish, and tobacco with a skewer.   There were apparently grilled cheese sandwiches on the bar too, but they were gone by the time I got through the line and they were never refilled at all while I was there.  Which was a long time. Table service continued to lag throughout the meal, so we were there over 2 hours for brunch when it was all said and done.   Finally, the food.  It looked great and I wanted to order everything on the menu.  My chicken and waffles though, was lacking.   The chicken was bland and dry.  The waffle was good, but I needed a little more syrup.     Overall, just lackluster.  I might give it another try non-brunch, but this wasn't a great first impression.",

Although the restaurant was packed, we were seated immediately and did not have to wait for our server to greet us. Their craft beer selection is great and our server did an excellent job of making some delicious suggestions. We tried their bison burger and their special of the night, a Korean BBQ burger, and both were excellent. Wait time was significantly short although they had a packed house that night which is very impressive. It was also nice to see the managers out on the floor helping the servers keep things running smoothly. For our first time there, we have no complaints and plan on coming back! A definite recommendation to anyone visiting the area!",

I had my 10yr old daughter with me; there wasn't much on the menu for her so she ordered the sour cream donuts. The donuts were AMAZING for my taste but not so much for hers as they aren't super sweet! (But trust me, you should get them). They don't have hot chocolate either, so she wasn't that happy haha but I was! I love that they have Arsenal ciders on tap, my favorite. Also always worth mentioning is that our service was great and the waitress was very nice! Lastly, the parking lot next door is super convenient if you can snag a spot! I am excited to try Urban Tap again minus my daughter and see what else they have to offer!",

    "text": "I'm torn here.  Their tap selections are solid and I had their burger at last year's Pittsburgher Competition and loved it.  This review is for their bar, not food, though.  I asked if the beer I wanted (8.2% ABV) came in a pint or chalice.  I was purely curious about that because I've seen different places have different benchmarks for a \"big beer.\"  Our bartender must have overheard me saying to my boyfriend that I always feel like I'm not getting my money's worth with a chalice because visually it's just smaller.  She started talking about how she purchased a beer at another restaurant and it was more expensive than what Urban Tap would have priced it at and how it was a rip-off (she was talking about the same restaurant I work for, actually).  This is a case of \"Don't run your mouth if you don't know who you're talking to.\"  She did offer samples of the beers I was torn between and she was assisting the couple next to us with suggestions.  So I'm trying to stay impartial in regards to her comments, though if you're reviewing the experience, that was part of the experience and it wasn't cool.  The other bartender seemed chill and like he had a good rapport with the customers.  The price here was on the high end of average for Pittsburgh: $6 for a beer (good Lord, when did $6 for beer become acceptable) so I don't know where she had room to act like they have the best prices around.  I'd love to come back and try the food - perhaps it'll be worth another star.",

We each had two great cocktails, but our favorite was the gin basil smash. It was refreshing and had great flavor! We split three appetizers: the roasted pork nachos, hot Asian bbq wings, and shredded pork tacos. The nachos were good, but nothing spectacular. I thought the pork was in too big of pieces to fit on a chip, but I enjoyed the addition of the cabbage slaw and the pico de gallo because they added nice tang and cut through the richness of the pork and cheese. The wings were awesome, and I don't usually enjoy wings! The sauce was sweet and spicy, and it paired really well with their homemade blue cheese dressing. The tacos were also really good! The pork was tender, the salsa was fresh, and the sauce on them was very good. I also liked that they used corn tortillas to add more flavor. I would definitely return back, and I'm sure you would not be disappointed if you stopped in! They have a great beer selection, good food, and an awesome atmosphere!",

Very spacious, clean, and comfortable. Lots of brick, and the \"re-claimed wood look\" inside.  They have a great Happy Hour, with half-off small plate appetizers, and (I think) $2 off drafts. There are 2 must have appetizers, which are frankly not something I'd ordinarily order at a HH. First, the Parmesan Truffle Popcorn is amazing! It's $2.50 at HH, and I can't get enough of it. Pairs great with a beer. Second are their Brussel Sprouts. I've had them at most of the big steak houses in the city, and Urban Tap's are better than any others that I've had. They also have excellent wings. Nicely cooked, meaty, and flavorful. I've also had the fish tacos, and the carnitas tacos, and both are good, but not spectacular. Their Korean BBQ fires were amazing, but they seem to have removed them from the menu. Hope they reconsider offering them again. The burgers and fish sandwich are both great choices. I'd say the food is a solid 4.5 stars.  What pushes the Urban Tap into a 5 star rating is the service. I've always had outstanding service from each server I've had. All have been very friendly, attentive, and quick. Special kudos to Chad, who is the bartender/general manager, for outstanding customer service.",

Pros:  Awesome lamb burger Kitchen open late  Generous Draft Selection (including local breweries) Well-designed space  Great people-watching  Friendly service  Cons:  No prices on Draft list  Waitresses could know more about beer  Loud  The Urban Tap just opened a few months ago, and it has already made it into our list of places to go. Good food, good beer, good service, and good atmosphere is a tough combination to come by. This place also seems to toe the line well between restaurant and sports bar. The kitchen is open late, so we often end up here for a late dinner on weekday evenings.   Overall, I'm pleasantly surprised by the food at Urban Tap. It's not fine-dining, but it's many steps above average bar food. I like the topping combinations including tzatziki sauce on the lamb burger, and avocado with pineapple relish on the chicken sandwich. The salads are stuffed with interesting greens and generous toppings. The chevre-spinach salad with candied pecans and pancetta is a winner. They have generous portions which make the prices reasonable, though I haven't tried the more expensive entrees.   As with most South Side establishments, beware on Friday and Saturday nights. It will inevitably be a loud crazy bar with crappy service.",

The fries were undercooked and way too greasy from either peanut oil or vegetable oil. They're really thin fries so the greasiness actually made them hard to pick up.   The decor was great. I liked that the staff wore smart casual as their uniforms. The tables were sturdy and the place was nicely lit.   But I was really disappointed by the service. What's most disappointing is probably that my server didn't know that she was giving bad service.   I met my friend there and we were able to catch up on three months of not seeing each other before the waitress greeted me. I probably wouldn't have noticed but it was freezing and I'm getting over a cold and I wanted a hot tea. I get it - I'm a server - hot teas are a pain to make. There are a lot of components to a hot tea compared to a beer, but she audibly sighed, so I apologized.   After our food came to us, it was a good long time before she checked back. I had to wave her down for our check - interrupting her conversation with another staff member just so we wouldn't be late for our show. (We sat there for over an hour) She didn't offer boxes and our plates sat on the tables as we signed our check.   Maybe I'm just sensitive to it because I've worked in a restaurant most of my adult life so take my modest opinion with a grain of salt, but the price doesn't match the experience. Great potential here and it's not being met.",

And we had a side of the risotto, I forget which one, but it was great too.   I look forward to going back... it is bit on the pricey side for what it is, but if they are consistently good, I am willing to pay a little extra!",

    "text": "Yesterday we came here for brunch. We were all running late but our friend got here before us and ordered a few pitchers of mimosas. Can't beat it for $15. This is a new restaurant that has popped up since my move from Pittsburgh in 2013. Our waiter was pretty personable and cool. His name was josh. He handled a table of 5 women great with our indecisiveness about the menu. I ordered the Brussel Sprouts. Josh said this is something that is very popular and what they are known for. I see why. It was very flavorful and I wasn't sharing it. I also opted for the bison burger with a side of sweet potato fries. Josh recommended to get the burger medium which I usually don't do. I trusted his judgement and got it. It was perfect flavor and not too dry as bison can be. I like the spiciness of the sauce because it added an extra kick. The service was excellent and josh was attentive. He engaged well with us. My friend mentioned she liked their lunch menu even better than their brunch. He also told me that they make many of their things in house.",

Our food took hours to come out and when we did finally get our food it was cold and looked like it had been sitting out. It also took at least 45 mins to get a drink and we sat with empty glasses for an extremely long period of time until we were asked if we wanted another. When we finally order another drink another 30 minutes would go by until we finally got it. We would have been understanding for the kitchen being backed up if we didn't receive horrible service in every other aspect. Even if you wanted a water refill that alone would have been another 30 minutes of waiting. Maybe their service is better for dinner but I will definitely never go back for brunch here again.",

The weather was terrible last night so it wasn't that busy and we didn't have to wait at all.   Even the way they print their menu and drink menu is unique. Their drink menu is printed to look like a newspaper. They have a great draft selection.   I ordered the Mac n cheese as my entree along with a side of fries. They had a few vegetarian options, but I do wish the options were more varied. They had a sandwich and tacos but both had portabello mushrooms - and I'm not a fan.   However, my food was delicious! The portions were plentiful. The Mac n cheese was under the \"small plates\" but it was still very large and more than enough for my entree. And the fries were so so good! Very well seasoned. My husband got the bison burger and said it was delicious as well.   Overall it was a great experience. Their prices are a tad high, but the portions are large so you do get a lot for your money. They are supposed to have great brunch, so I look forward to coming back to try their brunch options.",

    "text": "We went for Brunch today and it compelled me to write a review immediately.  Quite possibly the best brunch and service that we have had in a long time.  Our best foodie experience of the weekend for sure.  Upon walking in, we were greatly promptly by two different people and told that we can have a seat wherever we would like.  We chose the bar which was obviously a great decision because it was some of the best service ever.  Seriously.   We decided to try a few different options since we haven't been here before, and every item was awesome.  I got the Urban BLT (candied bacon and jalapeno cream cheese) and Lyonnaise potato... So scrumptious.  The bread was perfect too... not too hard where it cuts the roof of your mouth (which has happened quite a few times other places).  The hubby got the sweet potato pancakes and omg they were amazing.  He also got the Savory Waffle sandwich (maple Apple sausage, arugula, and arugula)-looked amazing but I didn't try it.  The space is pretty awesome too.  I love the huge tap right when you walk in (which oddly I missed initially).  With brunch they have bottomless mimosas for $8.00 and a Bloody Mary bar (think the first one was $6 but others after would be $5 but don't quote me on that).    I definitely recommend this place... If the service remains as it was today and the other food is as great as the brunch menu was, the Southside has a new gem in this restaurant.",

    "text": "Came here on a Friday with a 530 reservation. I arrived early and was advised there weren't any reservations in their system at 530, only some at 600, none of which were the party I was meeting with.  Fortunately they were not busy, so securing a table was not a problem.  Interestingly, the person who made the reservation started receiving email alerts that her reservation time was approaching. We brought this to the hostesses attention, and she couldn't have cared less.  Regarding the food and drink...both were fantastic.  Because it was still under happy hour, our table ordered and shared 4 small plates, and each was a flavorful party in my mouth.  We tried the curry tofu, crispy Brussels sprouts, Mac and cheese, and sage maple popcorn.    For my entree, I got the steak house burger, but substituted the meat Patty for the black bean/poblano Patty. It was tasty, but as with most bean based burgers, a little too mushy for a sandwich.  I don't know what was on the fries for seasoning but they were out of this world.   Another great thing about the place is that, when we finished our meals, we hung out and chatted for a good while, and never once did we feel like we were in the way, taking up a table, or being rushed out. In fact, we were left alone to enjoy our conversation until we indicated we were ready for our checks. It was not to feel like we had to bolt right after eating.  One thing that really turned me off is that, because they have a daily rotating beer list, they have to print new menus daily. In a world where everyone is trying to be eco friendly, conserve as much as possible, and reduce the carbon footprint, printing menus daily is the opposite of going green and I'm surprised and disappointed that this is happening.  I asked the waitress what they do with the menus when they swap them put (because she was in the process of changing them when while we were dining) and she advised that they throw them away.  It's a real shame.  All-in-all, the food, drink, and service were great. The reservations and daily menu printing were very not great.",

My girlfriend was in town and we were looking for a place to grab lunch and some beers. We decided on Urban Tap and got there around 2:00 on a Saturday afternoon. It was packed (there was a Pitt game on) and the only place to sit was at the bar, which worked out better for us anyways. The bartender was super nice and allowed us to have samples of the beers before ordering any. We both got 3 beers and loved trying the different kinds!  We also both got the grilled chicken sandwich and it was seriously amazing! I keep thinking about it! It was served with avocado, red peppers, and siracha aioli. The bread was toasted to perfection! I hope that the Highland location will catch up to South Side's soon.",

We weren't acknowledged while we sat there, drink less. And every time I asked her for samples she looked as though I was bothering her. There was another guy behind the bar, but both of them chose to converse with staff members rather than help us with beer selections or acknowledge our presence. Very disappointing. I work in the restaurant business and I get it, but this was terrible. We were the only people at the bar. Come on. The food wasn't much better. The eggs Benedict 2 ways lacked flavor and sauce. My boyfriend got the chicken and waffles which didn't have enough syrup and the bone-in chicken made it a pain in the ass to eat. I doubt we would go back for brunch. The bloody Mary's sucked and even though the bloody bar was good, the mix was bland and lackluster. The beer selection was good, but getting a drink was a process is rather not repeat.

    "text": "Was very excited to check this place out this weekend. I was with a group of 6 people (4 males and 2 females). The bar was not crowded at all, and as we attempted to enter the bar the bouncer allowed the female members of our group into the bar with no questions asked. When the males attempted to enter the bouncer informed us that \"he could only allow two more males in due to fire code\".   I would understand his concern if the bar was at capacity or if the gender had not been mentioned, but last time i checked Pennsylvania fire code does not set gender limits.  Extremely disappointed and will not be returning.",

Haven't had the food, but the crowd, the beer selection, and the space all contribute to  making a visit a pretty good experience.  However, I will say that I won't be going back.  The place isn't so great that it's worth putting up with its miserable bartender.  One of the girl bartenders last night carded all of my friends (all 25+) which is no big deal, it's in the southside and I could see carding us, but she was waiting for us to get out our ID's and said, loud enough for everybody within 20 feet to hear it, \"your friends are really annoying me\".    Really? That's how you act in the service industry, like a petulant child?  We were all (10 of us, so a couple of hundred dollars of revenue in 2 hours) very put off.   There is not a single job where acting like that is okay. If she was my employee, she'd be gone.",

Nothing I have had or seen has ever been not good.  Great draft selection that rotates seasonally and many other options for non-beer drinkers.

Got to the reservation early but we were promptly seated and our attentive waitress was at our table with water and to give her input on the expansive beer list. When the wife's first selection was kicked, the waitress suggested a couple of alternatives. We didn't feel rushed and she made sure we were happy with our selections before moving on.  We got the Brussels app which were roasted well and had a nice balsamic glaze on them. Good size for sharing.  I got the cod sandwich which had to be one of the best fish sandwiches I've had recently. The fish was was moist and flaky and practically fell apart in my mouth. A far cry from the super jumbo mega fish that's been fried to a hockey puck consistently you get in some places. My wife go the lamb burger and couldn't stop talking about how good it was. She finished the whole thing, which for her is unusual.  If I had to point out one drawback is that it is very loud inside. Beyond the normal chatter you get at a place like this, the front windows were open. The breeze is nice but this place sits right on Carson street so you get s lot of traffic noise. The local bikers seemed to get a kick out of cranking on the throttle when they were stopped outside waiting for the light to change.  This happened enough times that it definitely seemed like they were making a point to be as loud as possible. Wouldn't stop me from going back but a couple of times the conversation stopped at most of the tables around us while we all waited for the bikes to pull away.",

I also love smaller menus because it normally tells you that they do those few things really well... Normally. I ordered the wings in parmesan garlic. Firstly, the menu said that they were smoked and THEN fried, but when I ordered, the waitress asked if I wanted them smoked OR fried. I though \"Eh, oh well, fried food is the last thing I need,\" so I ordered them smoked to try something new and different. For $8.50 I got 6 whole wings (the drumstick and wing still attached), and 2 pieces each of carrot and celery. Unfortunately, the garlic parm sauce was completely flavorless somehow-- and the smoked wings just tasted more like... bitter & charred. The wings weren't terribly meaty and just ended up tasting fatty and like processed smoke flavoring rather than real barbeque-y smokiness. My friend got the BBQ belly hamburger which looked really good. It came with fries that our waitress really talked up, saying they were so good because they're never frozen. They were seasoned well, but other than that, they were just a mushy, texture-less pile of potatoes that were also really REALLY greasy. None of that great crispy exterior and fluffy interior I look for in a french fry. I also didn't like that the kitchen is in full, plain view from the dining room. I mean, it looked clean but...something about that doesn't sit right with me. For 2 craft beers and a plate of wings, I plunked down $24 including tip. I've had better wings at Hooters. The service was good, our waitress was really nice and the food and beer came quickly, but the food was well below what I expected for the atmosphere and the price. There are other, better options for upscale bar food with a twist and a good beer selection close by.",

I could order a side salad instead of fries with no extra charge.  It's was mixed greens and a great vinaigrette with tomato shredded carrots and radish.  My friend had a medium rare burger which was perfectly cooked with fries which were just the right amount of crispy and great herb seasoning.  I couldn't help but steal them off his plate!  Didn't even need to dip them in a sauce.  And the soup was perfect.  It was a cream based soup with I think ham potato mushrooms and seasoned perfectly.    Great quality food and whomever creates the menu obviously had a great eye for quality and puts a creative twist on every ingredient that goes into their food. Great atmosphere and creative lay out and they have a good eye for the details.   Service was good and our waitress was sweet.  Thanks for the great addition to south side!",

Funny, prompt, and always polite. All of my friends were flirting with him! He's on Tinder ladies. Check out the picture in my review. ;)   Our table got 4 carafes of mimosas. Even though there were only 5 of us, we couldn't help but be lushes in the early afternoon! I ordered the fried brussel sprouts for an appetizer and I also had a Cobb salad. Both great choices. I hate brussel sprouts that taste too earthy as if they were just picked from the ground, remained uncooked and then put on your plate. These were not those kind of sprouts. They were soo delectable--fried with both onion and bacon and seasoned to perfection. I could have eaten another plate of these, by the way. I sooo need this recipe. The Cobb salad as I said was great too. A great sized portion. The salad was really fresh.   I love everything about this place. The ambiance, the people, and the drinks. Of course, my friends and I stayed well over two hours, and we didn't feel rushed to leave at all. We are some chatty Kathys and I certainly felt that we could be there forever.",

They have a decent beer selection I went during happy hour they have half off drafts which is nice.

For brunch I've had the Eggs Benedict and the Chicken and Waffles. Both good choices - although I did put hot sauce on both for some added flavor. I think the favorite item on the menu is the brussel sprouts. They are cooked with bacon and make a great app for the table!  Downfall is the prices can be a bit more than some of the similar places in the southside and I've been there a few times when the service has been less attentive due to the crowd. Because it is a bit more upscale it does bring a more mature crowd than other Southside places, so it's certainly worth a try if you are on Carson St. Thurs - Saturday or any weekend morning!",

Gorgeous people served me good food and beer, and all is well with the world.  So let's get into the details of the service:  1.  Friendly greeting at the door,  but slowish attentiveness once seated.  A couple of bad taps later, and it was 20 minutes before I had a drink in hand.  2.  Chicken sandwich was excellent, very fresh.  More Siracha would have given this sandwich the kick it needed.  3.  Really healthy vibe in the room,  but quiet enough to hear friends around me.  They've got the atmosphere down.  4.  The torte wasn't a torte.  It's a cake, not remotely a torte.  Lots of whipped cream and unnecessary crap on the plate (cherry on top, really?) but the waitress was honest about the source of it (they import their dessert).  Not thrilling to experience.  Overall, I like the place.  It's a tap house, and meets what I expect from the name.  Let's tighten down some details and aim for five stars.",

The super nice server sat down across from me and chatted a bit and told me about the dinner/drink menu before taking my order!   The windows were all open to the street, which made the atmosphere really open and enjoyable. My beer was the perfect cold temperature, and my mac and cheese was delish!   Loved this place, the people, and the food! Check it out :)",

    "text": "Stopped here for lunch on the way back from sunny Florida. Ordered the shrimp banh mi tacos and a cup of the tomato soup.   The tomato soup was flavorful but oversalted. The consistency was a little more on the side of a whipped dip than a soup. It could have used a little more stock, cream or water to thin it out.   The banh mi tacos were also oversalted (this seems to be an issue with a lot of restaurant dishes lately) and really didn't resemble the banh mi sandwiches that I know. They did have cilantro, carrots and jalapeno but it must have been the glaze on the shrimp that threw off the taste.   The restaurant was warm and cozy with subtle lighting, bright windows and not-too-loud music.   The services was attentive and pleasant and there were only a few other patrons in the restaurant which was a nice respite from a crowded plane.   My husband ordered the catfish sandwich, herbed fries and the chili. The sandwich was nice-sized, the fries crisp and the chili not oversalted. He really enjoyed them.   So, not a bad place but not outstanding.",

The beer selection is pretty eclectic.  Seems a little IPA heavy but that is right up my alley.  Service is prompt and casual.  The menu is interesting and diverse.  We all stuck with small plates or sandwiches which were tasty.  I had the fish tacos from the small plate menu.  Three tacos was more than enough.  They were a little spicy, so if you aren't in on the spice, then ask for your jalapeno's on the side.    It is A-OK.  I wasn't wowed or disappointed.  It was just A-OK.",

I'm not sure if it was because of the food, atmosphere or getting to hang out with Carrie W. :D   The atmosphere itself was very nice, open and you felt comfortable. I love the open windows in the front to let everyone know down the block how much fun you're having, lol.   I ordered a carafe (or two!) or Mimosa which was really tasty. As Carrie said, each carafe is $10 and you get a good 5 glasses from it. During brunch hours, you could also order by the glass at $2 so it evens out.   For my meal, I decided on the shrimp and grits brunch. The plate had yummy shrimp, cheesy grits, pork belly crisp and a poached egg. I loved that the yolk of the egg seeped into the grits if that makes sense. They went well together. The shrimp was tasty as well as the pork belly. I've never had pork served like that but it was surprisingly good!  Service was just fine and I'm excited to head back! Maybe for brunch, maybe for lunch or dinner!",

Loved every single ingredient (warm chevre, spinach, candied pecans, shaved carrots, roasted beet, crisp pancetta and lemon vinegarette). Plus, with a $10.50 price tag, it didn't break the bank and it was a good size. I choose not to add chicken or salmon, but like that there's the option.  Service was quick and friendly! I really think if you're got a stellar salad, it can only go up from there! Excited to work my way through the tasty looking beer and food menu soon, once I can cheat:)",

I literally felt so unwelcome that when I sat at the bar I felt like I was pissing everyone off. UNREAL! The only thing that turned my experience around was my bartender he was super helpful pretty much told me what to order but he did not steer me wrong.

It was juicy and I really liked the collection of toppings- I'm a more is more kind of girl when it comes to toppings! I ate the whole thing, against my better judgement. Oops...   I would probably give Urban Tap a solid 3 stars for being a good spot with above average food and ok decor, but the service bumped it up another star. We came in on a Monday so it was pretty dead, but our server was fantastic. I forget her name, but tall and blonde. She let me sample a few wines to decide which one I wanted, was really personable, and recommended a green tea shot to us which sounded awful but in reality was totally delicious. She also gave us the low down on where to look for going out spots after dinner. Overall, I would definitely go back, and if you're staying around the Carson St area you should definitely stop by here!",

The bartenders were kind enough to confirm that I had ample time to buy one round of drinks before leaving for the night.  What followed was behavior, by the owners no less, that was so abhorrent that I never intend to patronize this place again.  2-3 minutes after spending over $50 on a final round of drinks, someone yelled at me to \"Get the f*ck out of the bar.\"  I looked over at a table of 5 guys that were now purporting to be the owners of the bar.  They were literally yelling at me (for no apparent reason) to leave and they began to use words such as, but not limited to, \"Faggot\" and \"Asshole\" while one man with a beard began to comment on my clothes and hair.  They went as far as to be rude to the girls in my group as well -- again, for no apparent reason.  I'll point out that these men all seemed to be under the influence of a lot of alcohol and drugs, as well.  Rather than have things escalate, we took the high road and left.  On the way out, the staff was kind enough to confirm that these \"gentlemen\" actually did own the bar.  This will all feel worthwhile if even one person opts to not patronize this establishment as a result of this review.  The people that own this place should absolutely be ashamed of themselves.",

    "text": "Love coming here for any occasion, but especially to watch a sports game.  TVs are set up all around, so you have a great view from any table.  I haven't usually had a problem getting a table, but you can call ahead for a reservation.  The food is really good and even pretty healthy, especially for a sports bar.  I have had the black bean burger, which is amazing if you are vegetarian or vegan.  Last night we got the pork nachos to snack on, which were messy but tasty.  I also love their fries.  If you're looking for a lighter snack, they have a couple different styles of popcorn to choose from; I have had both the sage & maple and the truffle bacon & parm, and would recommend either.  When I think about Urban Tap though, I really think about the tap--they have an excellent selection to choose from, regardless of what style of beer you prefer, and rotate their selection pretty frequently, great if you're looking to try something new!",

Great selection of beer, but they also make a good cocktail and have a nice wine selection. Food is very well prepared with a selection of appetizer, small, and large plates. Every staff member I encountered was very friendly and accommodating. Been there twice and had a very good experience each time. Will certainly be back!",

I've been trying to eat a little lighter so I thought it would be a good choice. What I got was fried chicken, covered in gravy with potatoes and sauteed greens. While it wasn't what I expected, I was not disappointed. The chicken was crispy and the gravy was flavorful. The potatoes I couldn't have cared less about but the greens were amazing. Some of the best I've ever had. I asked the waiter what was on the greens and he told me apple cider vinegar and red pepper flakes but there has to be something they are hiding! These greens were special and I am determined to find out the secret. My boyfriend got the pulled pork burger and had a pretty clean plate by the end. All around I loved my meal and was not upset that I didn't get grilled chicken!",

It had that hip, dare I say, Urban vibe to it, and it was well done. Located right in the heart of South Side and conveniently next to a small parking lot, Urban Tap is, in my opinion the perfect spot for after work meet ups, happy hour, dinner.. whatever your mood may be.    Our server was totally on point. He suggested the mojito for my drink and it was amazing. For my appetizer I ordered the Brussel sprouts (what else, right?) and they were great! Not the best Brussels I've had, but still really good. For my dinner, I ordered the chicken sandwich, again at our servers suggestion, and just like the Brussel sprouts, it wasn't life changing, but I liked it and of course cleared my plate (no sense in being wasteful, after all!).   We definitely enjoyed our evening at Urban Tap and I'm already looking forward to our next visit :)",

The portions were kind of small, and the food was good...but I don't know that I would say \"best brunch in the burgh.\"  We had a large party (9 people) and the service was a bit slow, which is unusual for UT.

Place opened at 11, we were some of the first there and had to wait about 30 mins for our food.   I got the eggs benedict (never a question when it's on the menu) and I was turned off by how salty the biscuit and cornbread were. The proportions of the dish were also off so I had trouble getting egg, biscuit and meat and sauce all in one bite. My friend ordered the same and we both were very disappointed.   Others in our group got burgers which they said were good, but with the slow service and the disappointing dish I'm not sure if I'll make this a regular stop.",

They were great!   I ended up ordering the bison burger and fries. The fries were good so was the bison burger. The bun was a little hard for me though. A couple bites in I ditched the bun. The server suggested getting the bison burger medium and he was spot on. It was very flavorful.   What really stood out the most was our server! He was attentive and on point! Something I imagine is hard when you have 5 hungry women who've just guzzled 4 crafts of mimosas!   Maybe next time I go back I'll actually get brunch!",

Happy hour beers were between 3-5$.   Food wasn't anything out of this world. The small plates surprisingly cost more than the large plates and sandwiches, with the happy hour deal they came out to be about the same price.

We had Bloody Mary's and Mimosas which were both very good. I had a Ruben. The house made corned beef was pretty good, and the fries were seasoned nicely.   Service, however, was pretty deplorable. We arrived just as brunch service was ending, and from the time we were seated, it felt as if our service wasn't wanted at all. Our server made maybe 3 stops to our party of 6, and by the end of our meals, all of our cups had been empty for at least 15 minutes. We racked up bills of $20+ a person, which I am perfectly fine with, given the quality of food and drink, but the service made it feel like an absolute rip off. Our server sat in the back while we waited for more water, and came back only when we were ready for our bills.  In short, this place has some potential to be a prime spot on Carson street, food and alcohol selection are impressive. However, poor service and steep prices are holding me back than giving this place higher than 3 stars",

I love everything about this place... from the welcoming and energetic staff, to the industrial interior design and great beer and cocktail selection. I love the gimlet, whiskey sour, and mules here.The bartenders will make the drinks just how you like them. If you're ever unsure about what to drink they may lead you in the right direction based on your preferences.   This restaurant is great to hang out with friends and socialize! The arrangement of tables allows you to enjoy conversation and feel the energetic environment around you. Choose a small booth or table and you can enjoy a more private engagement with a single guest.   The food here is very delicious. My brunch favorite is the \"avo and eggs\"! I love how they bake the avocado just right and the side potatoes are filling and not greasy. Their menu caters to all sorts of appetites and diets too. I have heard the \"chicken on a biscuit\" is a great option if you're really hungry and enjoy savory  comfort food. The mimosa flights are super colorful and fun to share! Each one tastes unique with fresh fruit and tons of refreshing, bold flavor.   I have tried the \"big fish on a little roll\" here for dinner as well. The serving is massive, so have a good appetite! This was definitely the best fish sandwich I have ever had. I would definitely consider ordering this again!   Make sure to stop by at the Urban Tap the next time you visit Southside Pittsburgh, I don't think its possible to be disappointed here!",

I used to be a huge fan of The Urban Tap, but maybe everyone else is too which is why they've reduced portions, changed bacon, and increased prices.  Even just a few months ago our mimosa carafe was $14.  Now the price has increased 30% making in $18.  My initial shrimp and grits picture looks nothing like what the shrimp and grits looks like now.  I've ordered the most recent shrimp and grits and it's paltry in comparison.  I was also amazed with the butcher block bacon in my initial review a few months ago.  Whatever bacon they use now pales in comparison.  I came with a party of 10 to show some friends out of town the delicious food Pittsburgh had to offer and the hostess was not too happy about that.  So I'd say if you have a larger party, The Urban Tap may not be the place for you.  However, everyone in my group seemed to enjoy their meal.  All in all, compared to what I used to love about The Urban Tap, whatever changes they've made have made them just \"eh ok\" in my book.",

    "text": "We LOVED Urban Tap! Ended up here Saturday night after realizing City Works did not have the SEC Network. Quick uber ride across the river and was so worth it! Huge projector screens and several additional TVs. Food and service were fantastic. We ordered a mix of things - pork nachos, short rib poutine, shrimp banh mi tacos and general tsos cauliflower. The cauliflower was simply incredible. Everyone at the table loved it and I wanted more! The only food that was \"just okay\" was the pork nachos - they didn't have a ton of flavor, needed a little kick! Otherwise everything was great, we were SO happy to find Urban Tap and will definitely be back next time we are in Pittsburgh!",

We ordered wings (mustard BBQ sauce), shrimp tacos, and herb fries. The wings were cooked well but dry and relatively flavorless. The sauce was too thin and tasted like it was made hastily or, worse, came from a generic bottle. The tacos weren't good either. The shells seemed poorly made and had an odd aftertaste, my friend said. The fries were great. Nice balance of crunchiness, saltiness and flavor. I don't think I would go back. Most of the food was a miss, the cocktails were good and the service was great. But that's just not enough.",

    "text": "This review is based on a recent dinner. For us, Urban Tap is a not a hop, skip and a jump away. It takes us about 30 minutes to get there and then deal with parking. Our first several dinners were great, on the old menu. Our most recent dinner was just meh, for a couple of reasons. One, they significantly changed the menu and IMO took off the good stuff, like the fish tacos, seared scallops and corn bread to name a few. Still, we each found something to order. The food was fine, especially after one of the us scraped off the excessive jalapenos on the shrimp tacos. He's ordered these before and they weren't overloaded so I'm not sure what was going on.   Our server was training another sever and it was her first day. It seemed to us that they weren't communicating as to who was taking the lead on which table. Consequently we had to ask for food that was part of the meal but not delivered. The wait after we got the check was long and I ended up flagging down the server to get him to take our payment. So, food was okay, service was lacking. Taking Urban Tap off our list which is a shame because we used to love this place and recommend it a lot.",

It was chilly and they happily shut the window for us. We all shared the Korean BBQ fries appetizer. They were in love with it, but I thought it was just alright. I'm usually not a fan of sweet and savory mixed together, but I was still able to appreciate it. The appetizer was a bit expensive, but it came in a large portion.  Despite getting a fries appetizer, I still chose fries for the side of my Tap burger (yes, clearly I'm too crazy about fries). It, too, came in a very generous portion (YES!) and the burger was tasty. I had ordered egg with my burger, but they had forgotten about it. Once I told my server, he said he'd bring out an egg immediately.   Will return (as long as the portion of fries remains the same)!

The fresh bread served with the plate was phenomenal.  I also had the vegetable muffuletta. I thought the green beans tasted a little strange on the sandwich, so I took them off to eat separately and was left with an amazing sandwich. The balsamic portobellos and roasted tomatoes made a beautiful pairing. I liked the side salad but the champagne dressing was a bit too oily for me and needed some acidity.   I had the urban mule to drink, and it was a solid \"mule\" type drink but nothing special.",

    "text": "Such mixed feelings!!!!!       If I am simply reviewing the food that I've had thus far, I'm giving it a solid 4 stars, maybe even 4 and a half. They present a creative menu, definitely far and above normal bar food, and most importantly, they execute it well. Kudos all around for that.      I'm okay with the space, though I think it does seem a bit confused. What is it? A gastropub? A great foodie destination? A frat boy sports bar? Who knows...      This \"identity problem\" seems to carry over to service, unfortunately. I've experienced the perfect balance of friendly, knowledgeable and professional along with the dismal bar server who looked hungover, acted hungover AND chatted about her hangover with unengaged employees, hanging around the bar, lounging on a banquette, oblivious to the presence of customers. Coupled with a group of old-enough-to-know-better guys at the bar who acted like they just discovered the F-word (and couldn't say it often or loud enough...) definitely detracted from what would have been a perfect brunch.      For this reviewer, it seems easy enough to back up this great food with great service, but thus far it just isn't happening. Management needs to be as involved with service as they are with culinary creativity & excellence. Casual doesn't equal lazy.",

Apparently they were too busy for this as a party of 20 called right before us.  To my surprise we were seated right away.  If you like Blood Mary's I recommend trying their Bloody Mary bar-lots of great add ins. They also have unlimited mimosas for $14.  I went with the waffle slider which was a sunny side up egg, sausage, gyre cheese and arugula in between 2 waffles.  I asked for a fried egg which they did not do, the sausage was McDonalds quality at best and the waffles were saggy. It was served with a side of potatoes which were delicious.  My other big complaint is that a friend ordered an omelet and wanted egg whites which they would not accommodate saying that they were too busy.  Our orders took a while to be served but they were so busy for a Sunday. I say skip the brunch and go for drinks. I would like to go back and try happy hour.",

However, when you're presenting yourself as a gastropub and charging those prices for food & drink, you don't also get to have gigantic TVs covering every square inch of the place, and garish faux/steel girders and rivets everywhere. Choice of beer is good but unsurprising for Pittsburgh. A lot of the same breweries that everyone has (Souther Tier, Fat Heads, etc). Bartender was not very knowledgable about beer choices but I will say that all the staff was extremely nice and helpful - they keep the place from just getting one star. I had their mac & cheese as an appetizer and it was fine. Nothing amazing.  If I want to go out for a drink, I like to be able to converse with friends without distraction, and the abundance of TVs and loud, garish decor (and customers) everywhere in Pittsburgh is exhausting. Why aim (and charge) for a higher standard when at heart it's just the same old South Side nonsense? Very disappointed.",

    "text": "Very nice atmosphere to the place.  A lot of attractive servers. For some reason I'm really attractive to the font they use for their logo as well. Went last Saturday Brunch for bottomless mimosas. This particular morning was pretty mellow, . Too hungover to order any real food, although their menu was pretty impressive. I ended up getting up just getting the yogurt and fruit. The berries were very fresh but I suggested they should mix it with a vanilla yogurt over plain. I got bored with it and gave it to my friend. I enjoyed the set up of the place, the overall ambiance, but if you notice there are several random chairs that don't match the rest. Anyways, I would come back, maybe check out the food. Very chill environment. They had a ton of drafts too which was cool. And a secret plus is there were outlets basically every third seat at the bar. The only real disappointment of the place was the one cocktail I ordered: The Frequent Flyer. With Gin, Berenjager, orange, cherries, pineapple juice, and club soda, it seemed like my dream drink but the cherries were so overwhelming all I could compare it to is cough syrup. However, the place is fairly new so I'm sure they'll work all the kinks out.  Overall, cool place, I'd stop by again, maybe lunch next time.",

    "text": "The space is really rustic and wonderful but there is something off with the acoustics...it is LOUD LOUD LOUD in there. I had to shout across the table just to have a conversation.   We all ordered a few apps and meals.  Mushroom Poutine: This is not Poutine...there were no cheese curds, no gravy...a real disappointment. The blue cheese really takes over and over powers the taste of this dish so much so that you cannot enjoy the truffle oil or wild mushrooms. The fries themselves were good, however...very crisp.  Short Rib Nachos: These were just weird. The chips were deep fried and covered in candied jalapeno queso which had absolutely no flavor and it was so sparse . The lime napa slaw just gave the whole dish a weird lime flavor that was not pleasant. The pico de gallo on top was cold and flavorless as well.   Grilled Romaine with Salmon: This dish was pretty good...my only complaint is that a large portion of the dressing (both caesar and balsamic reduction) was added to the dish which made for some pretty soggy grilled lettuce. But the salmon was very, very good.   They also were out of Pinot Grigio and out of the Lamb Bolognese and it was only about 5:30-6.   Finally, we had the vegetarian pasta which was pretty good! The homemade pasta was perfectly cooked and had a light and fresh sauce on top with tomatoes.   I just feel like there are so many good restaurants here now in PGH...this place needs to step their game up or at least taste the food they are sending out? I would probably not go back here again.",

Big beer selection and great mixed drink list. I enjoyed a Moscow mule, had to essentially give a security deposit on the cooper cup which was fun. I got a house salad and the side of butternut squash risotto. Soo good! The risotto could have been hotter but the flavors where great. And a good mixed greens salad. A great place for friends either for dinner or just drinks for a fun night out where you can still talk to friends. Our waitress was also great fun and conversational but not awkward or annoying.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place because it looks great and they had awesome beer selections, but the service was so strange that the experience was almost surreal.    We walked in with 7 people and asked for a table.  The host said there would be a wait, which was totally fine considering our party size, but refused to give us any kind of estimate of how long the wait would be, other than \"it could be a while.  Anywhere  from 15 minutes to an hour.  I just don't know.\"  After trying a few times to figure out what \"a while\" meant, we decided to get beers at the bar while we waited.   About 15-20 minutes later, we were finishing our beers and discussing how strange it was that the host refused to give us any kind of wait estimate, when he walked up behind us and said \"you know I can hear you talking about me, right?\" We chatted about how it would be nice to get an approximate time, even if it was an overestimate, and he agreed at first, but said he didn't want to give us too much of a wait because he didn't want us to leave.  I told him that it wasn't his decision whether we stayed or left, and that we just wanted an honest estimate.  The host then started to complain to us about two girls sitting at a large booth who had apparently been there for a few hours, and had paid 45 minutes before, but hadn't left yet. He then told us that a table should be ready when \"those two guys finally leave\" pointing and at a table of guys within ear shot.  We decided not to take the table and leave, at which point he offered us 3 other occupied tables to try and keep us there.  I've never experienced such an unprofessional host. Also, I find it really strange that there are no beer prices on the wall or on the paper menu.  Like most customers, I'd like to know about how long the wait is and how much I'm going to pay.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I am not a 20 something barfly who frequents the Southside to pound shots and beer until I can stand up. I'm a normal 50 something working person who enjoys well prepared food and excellent service.  I work on the Soithside and have been to this place many times for lunch. There is nothing wrong with the food at Urban Tap.  It's not the best food I've had, it's certainly not the worst.  The duck poutine is actually quite delicious, although I wouldn't eat it every day.  The burgers are fine and the salads are fine.    My problem with the Urban Tap is what seems to be a complete lack of regard for customer service.  The lunch service is adequate, unless it's busy.  But something happened tonight that really turned me off.  I met my husband there for a pre-concert bite to eat and he arrived before I did.  He was seated at a table right in front of the open kitchen and when I got there, he told me about a 20 minute conversation he'd heard booming out of the kitchen about blowjobs.  Seriously.  The cooks and the waitstaff were taking at the top of their voices about the finer points of administering oral sex to men.  At full volume.  Shortly after I got there, I saw a large, filthy, sweaty guy in a brown chef jacket saunter behind the bar and start pouring himself soda after soda.  We were there for about an hour and he was behind the bar for the last 15 minutes of our visit.   I can only assume it was the cook.  And other staff were wandering in and out from behind the bar taking to him.  His assistant also came out and hung out behind the bar.    This is just bad form.  I saw nobody that resembled a manager doing anything to supervise.  As close and convenient as this place is to my office, I can't imagine going back.  Yikes!",

I'm talking top five burgers of my life wrong. I originally set out to order the short rib sandwich. Our sever let us know that this wasn't a sandwich so much as a pile of tender short rib on top of a juicy burger. I almost passed for caloric reasons, but decided to go for it. Good move apparently, because it was perfect all around -- perfectly cooked and perfectly tasty. Much to my dismay, upon a recent inspection of their menu, this burger no longer seems to be an option, but I'm not deterred. The quality of the burger alone paired with the \"toppings\" they still offer (I quote \"toppings\" because meat on a burger seems less like a topping and more like a gift from the heavens) including pulled pork and brisket still seem like they'll make for a burger fit for anyone's top five list.  Also, as an aside to one of the most delicious burgers I have ever had, the service was great, the bathrooms were clean, and they had an excellent draft beer list. Two of the beers we ordered during our meal ended up being recently kicked and rotated out. While we were bummed to not get our first choices it was great to know that they keep the beer moving, which means it's fresh. A win for everyone.",

I was impressed with the menu, which offered more vegetarian options than I'm used to. I ordered a fried tofu sandwich, which was good. I don't normally pay attention to timing, but it was pretty  slow (10-15 minutes.) My date noted that a sandwich was sitting on the kitchen counter for at least five minutes before someone grabbed it. A sizeable group of young boys were near our table--they seemed out of place in a sports bar, but I guess it's good to know that the place is kid-friendly.

    "text": "I dined here about a week or two after they opened so it does sound like it has improved somewhat since I have been there. I have been wanting to go back so I'd have a more positive review but time has not lent itself to that. Our server was nice enough but it took her 10 minutes to even come over to greet us and it was pretty clear that she had no idea what was going on. Frankly it seemed like no one knew what was going on-there was a 1:00 steeler's game that was going to be on and at 1:30pm they STILL had on ESPN 30 for 30 or some other program-whatever it was,it was not the football game. And the volume was incredibly loud! deafening is a good word to describe how loud it was. Enough people in the place caught on that we were obviously going to have to ask for the game...and then it took them another 20 minutes to figure out how to work the tvs. So I will say they had a nice draft selection. And the open air atmosphere near the window was nice that day. Our food....it could have been good with a few tweaks. I ordered the smoked gouda mac (no meat). 1. the server asked if I wanted chicken or chorizo-never stating it was an upcharge but asking like I had a choice to make that was included. I didn't want meat in it so really this wasn't an issue for me but I could see how someone else may be upset about the $3 upcharge without being informed about it first even though it's right on the menu). 2. The mac was rather cold. If it was heated it would have been really good but I never had the opportunity to ask for it to be reheated since I didn't see our server or any other server for the next 20 minutes. My boyfriend ordered the benedict 2 ways and he said it \"was ok\". Coming from him that means it wasn't very good. Also, they had bottomless mimosas for $8 which tasted like the alcohol was entirely left out. The server was ill informed as to when the mimosas stopped. Also, she kept me mimosas! At one point I LITERALLY had 4 mimosas in front of me and since I'm not a big fan of them to begin with, only 1 was partially finished. And then guess what happened? She brought over another! So now I had 5 mimosas in front of me.....and no room on the table at all for my boyfriend's beers! According to the server, they \"were trying to get rid of them.\" Exactly what you should tell a customer, however, being that they were clearly basically alcohol free, no wonder they were stuck with a lot leftover. Hopefully I'll get a better experience the next time I visit although,after this very odd and disappointing experience,I'm not sure when i'll make a return visit.",

    "text": "I've been to Urban Tap for brunch three times now. This past Sunday I woke up craving a Bloody Mary bar and when I realized I never wrote a actual review for Urban Tap my mind was automatically made up. I was so excited I rushed my boyfriend to get ready so we could get there as soon as they opened.   Upon walking in the door I realized the Bloody Mary bar wasn't where it once was. I thought to myself surely they still have it so maybe it's moved. I quickly learned that they swapped the bar for 5 \"specialty bloody Mary's\". Which doesn't agree to their website whatsoever. Knowing they had 5 options I wasn't overly upset. That all changed as I read the menu further. 1 was a Bloody maria, 1 was a michelada, and 1 had a stout side car? So that left 2 options and one of those options was just a basic Bloody Mary. Needless to say it sucked and I wasn't thrilled.  Entree wise I went with the huevos rancheros as it is one of my favorite brunch dishes. Again, what a fail on their part. It tasted like can salsa poured into the bottom of a bowl with 2 tortillas, some short rib, and eggs. It had little to no toppings and if there was rancheros sauce I definitely didn't taste any. It was so utterly disappointing that I ate maybe 1/4 of it.   I really want to like this place. I've tried it 3 times and each time it's something new that disappoints me. Other people seem to like it so I won't discourage anyone from trying it but please note the Bloody Mary bar doesn't exist if you are a bruncher who looks for that.",

Our waiter, while pleasant, was somewhat less then attentive, even before he was assigned to a very large group that came in while we there. I recommend two improvements - better training for wait staff and dedicated tap lines for the ciders so those with celiac can enjoy the tempting selections.",

    "text": "We have been to Urban Tap 3 times over the years and it's time to write a review.  The first time we came here we got brunch.  This was like 3 years ago so it's been awhile but the brunch I had was excellent.  It was a three different way eggs benedict.  So good! So brunch is very good here and I recommend it.       The second time that we came here we just stopped by for some drinks.  We weren't here long but it's always a nice place to watch a sporting event.  It's open, seems clean, and there are televisions everywhere.       For our third visit we were here for like 3 hours.  So I got enough for a decent review of the place.  We came here to watch the Pens play a playoff game.  We got here on a Sunday afternoon a little before 3pm.  It was a little busy but we found a couple seats at the bar.  The bar is big and we enjoyed this bar.  The bartender greeted us and we found a lot of good drinks on tap.  They didn't have our favorite style of beer which is a New England Ipa but we found some good drinks.  We just missed the brunch special to get a Irish coffee but my wife ended up ordering one anyways because she was in the mood for it.  We were going to eat at another restaurant after so at urban Tap we were just interested in drinks and watching the game.         We had a good time watching the game here.  I think the service was good and the beer too.  My only complaint would be the projection screens that we were watching the game on.  They have two large ones at the bar.  It's nice because it's big but part of a light is blocking the beam and it's just not as clear as the other televisions they had around.  We still were able to see good but it would have been better with a LCD TV in my opinion. Overall we really like this place to have brunch and have some drinks while watching a game.  You never know what your going to get in the Southside but you know what you will be getting at Urban Tap.  A Good Time!",

All of the burgers I have had here have been pretty good.  Not on the level of the best places in Pittsburgh, but still above average.  They also have some really good and unique appetizers like the general tsos cauliflower and fried brussel sprouts.  I would like to see them add some more options to their menu.  It is a very limited menu, and while they do most things very well, a little variety would be nice.  Update: they have updated their menu since the last time I was in. They took the focus off of burgers and have a wider variety of options now which I like.  I had the hot chicken sandwich and it was great.",

    "text": "I was planning a bachelorette party for my friend, and was looking for a place that took reservations on a Friday night. Let me tell you, that is a hard thing to find in the Southside. When I discovered the Urban Tap took reservations, I quickly made a reservation for 9 people. When I arrived, I was a bit \"frazzled\" as I rushed there from work in time to make it for happy hour and to ensure I'd be the first one from the party to arrive. The bartender could tell I was a little stressed, and kindly asked me if I was ok. I was so impressed by his kindness, and really appreciated it. Our server was extremely friendly and kind. As for most large parties, guests were coming in slowly and it took almost an hour for all of us to arrive before we ordered our food. As a former server, I know that can sometimes be frustrating. However, our server was SO patient and kind with us the entire time. For food, my friend and I ended up splitting quite a few things. We went with the fried chicken sandwich with brussel sprouts as a side, an appetizer order of the fried brussel sprouts, the mac & cheese, and the general tso's cauliflower. The food was excellent. It's hard to pick a favorite, but the mac & cheese really stood out to me. Everyone at our table loved the food. Regarding drinks, the Urban Tap has a really great selection of beer, and lots of cocktails to choose from. I went with a seasonal beer and loved it. Their happy hour deal is really awesome- 1/2 off drafts! At the end of our meal, I realized that I didn't think about an important detail of this party. I had made one of those large frame signs for the bachelorette party and had no where to put it, as we were going to be bar hopping down southside and I didn't want to lug it with me. I asked our server if I could keep it at the Urban Tap overnight and come grab it in the morning. Without hesitation, they said it would be fine. I came back the next morning and was again met by another friendly face who brought the sign back to me. Honestly, I was blown away with the service here. That alone is worth coming back to, but it doesn't hurt that the food is delicious as well!",

I ordered their house burger with no cheese and fries, as well as a drink (forgot the name but was red with a mint and had Bombay Sapphire).   Service was on the slower end.. they also had to redo my burger because they accidentally made it with cheese the first time. My drink was on the sweeter side, didn't really taste the alcohol. One of my friends ordered the cider but said he didn't like it.   Food was solid. The beef in the burger was juicy and not overcooked, but it was just a burger at the end of the day. The fries are a bit garlicy and tasted amazing the first few bites, but after awhile it gets old and greasy. Decent place to check out with a group... Perhaps best to go during happy hour if they have one?",

    "text": "If you're looking for variety and something different for a happy hour, this is the place to go. They have a wide selection of beers, ciders, and sours on tap from you to choose from. Draft drinks are half off during happy hour, so you feel more free to try something new rather than your go-to drink. They also have a good variety of food options. We ordered the giant soft pretzel with beer cheese, loaded nachos, wings, and general tso cauliflower. The cauliflower and pretzel were my favorite out of the appetizers we ordered and provided enough food for our group to all try. The wings were sort of plain, just breaded chicken with no sauce and the skin fell off the meat as soon as you bit in. Overall, the restaurant has a good rustic atmosphere and a more mature crowd than other bars in South Side and a great selection.",

I've usually had burgers, but have tried tacos & Brussels sprouts as well. They have a lot of good craft beers on tap. The place is nice looking inside & the front tables are open to the street on summer. I had the double tap burger with tots last night. Burger was prepared to my liking, and had a lot of toppings. Bun was nice & soft. They also do a Bison burger, which I have not tried yet. I had Full Pint White Lightning. I sat at the bar, which was not overly crowded & service was efficient. I had tots instead of fries with my burger & they make these unique square tots that are fairly large & I couldn't even finish the last two. They also serve brunch here, but I have yet to try it since I don't live in the city.",

It is the most delicious thing I have ever ate, no lie. The meat was so moist and tender. The roll was fresh. The sandwich includes a beer cheese and garlic aioli which are two of my favorite toppings. The house tator tots are shredded hash browns fried to perfection. The wings are fried in duck fat so they fall apart as soon as you pick them up to eat them. The beer selection is full of variety for those drinking beer. There is house cocktails as well as wine selections. If ever back in Pittsburgh I will for sure be back!",

I guess that maybe seems like a cool unique thing to do, but there's a reason you won't see that anywhere else. They don't even give you a spoon to scoop it out yourself. Totally ridiculous.

The beer selection was substantial, which made most in our group happy. One did not drink beer so (after asking) we were pleased to see a nice cocktail menu. She loved her muddled strawberry cocktail.  The best part of the meal was the appetizers. We enjoyed the fried brussel sprouts with bacon, onion, and mustard as well as a very large soft pretzel and IPA beer cheese. The brussel sprouts and onions were crispy and perfectly salted, and the vinegar mustard was a good compliment to the rich bacon. The beer cheese was really creamy - it tasted nothing like the nacho cheese that often accompanies pretzels.  I was really feeling tacos, but was disappointed when I found out that there was no mix and match available. I shared the shrimp banh-mi and haddock tacos and found them to be subpar. The seafood was well cooked but, despite being topped with jalapenos, the tacos were not very flavorful. They needed more spice or sauce. The tortilla shells were hard and tasteless.   I also shared the hot fried chicken sandwich. The chicken was cooked well and the plain white bread made for a delicious sandwich. I found the breading to be overcooked and not very spicy. The fries were the crispy kind, but there were too many small pieces and they were very salty.  The restaurants on Carson get very busy, so this could be a good option for those looking for average food and good beer.",

    "text": "In a sea of bars and restaurant in Pittsburgh it's hard to stand out and I think Urban Tap has done that. They have an impressive draft list, a decent Whiskey list, and good foods to back it all up.   The \"Bro Bros\" and I went here for a Beer to catch up and we had a pretty good time. I got the \"Chevre and Jam\" burger which was really good. I mean how can you go wrong with Jam and Goat cheese. The burger was very meat ballish. I don't know how they cooked the burger all the way through when it was practically a ball but they did. I'm not the biggest fan of ball like burgers but it was good so no complaints I guess.   The only bone I have to pick with Urban Tap is with their Whiskey. Their more modestly price Whisky's were around 6-7 bucks. Above the section it said \"neat\" and then in Parenthesis it said \"( there is a $2 up charge for on the rocks)\" So I thought fine, Neat is 7 on the rocks is 9. Fair enough.   Not so according to the waitress. All their Whiskey's apparently are served as shots. So the price you see is the shot price. There is an up charge for both the Neat and On the Rocks pours. After being told that \"she didn't write the menu\" she removed the 6 dollars of up charges that she had once added. I don't think it helped that we had been drinking or that we pointed out that they spelled \"Bulleit\" bourbon wrong on the menu. The Whisky has an \"i\" where the thing that is fired out of a gun does not.    What fine dining and gastropub sells all their Whiskey as Shots. Who is ordering shots of fine Whiskey? I have a feeling there is a misunderstanding as to how the pours and charges are suppose to go, but you might want to ask before ordering some. Either that or they want the perception of affordable Whiskey by only displaying the shot price then up charging you when you order it any other way.",

There's a variety of brunch items to choose from, and everyone in our group really enjoyed their food, especially the waffle slider and pierogie dish.

    "text": "This is a place that is relatively near me, and it is a place that I really want to like as it is often suggested by friends who want to \"try someplace new.\" The decor is solid, and the open front windows during the late spring, summer, and autumn are fantastic. Makes for a really good atmosphere to share a few drinks and people watch on Carson. I also really appreciate their attention to detail in their website/font/apparel design. Very trendy and inviting.   But it is a place that can't seem to quite settle on presenting, or maybe I mean maintaining?, itself clearly. For example, the beer list - though it does have some nice options on an ever-changing list - is never clear. I know this is in part due to the many microbrews who often like to create cryptic, clever titles to their beers like \"Evil Genius Purple Monkey Dishwasher\" (and yes, this is an actual beer), but I at least like to be able to guess whether a beer is a pilsner, stout, IPA, lager, wheat, etc. through title or at least aid of a menu. When seated at the bar it is OK, as getting a sample from a bartender during a quiet moment always works nicely, but when at a table on a busy evening, it feels somewhat belabored to request a taste -- and the server's strained expression that is holding back an eye-roll, one that seems to say, \"what, you don't already KNOW what the Evil Genius Purple Monkey Dishwasher is\" doesn't quite help change that impression for me. Nor does simply asking about it or other possibilities and being told, \"I really don't know. I generally don't drink beer.\" Which is cool, I guess. But then again, I also like to have some idea what I might be ordering and for which I'll be paying. Still don't know what the Evil Genius Purple Monkey Dishwasher is, btw. Guess I'll Google it shortly.  The gatstro-pub sort of fare is the same. Though the descriptions are clearer than the beer menu and are often enticing, what will actually come out is a True unknown. Having had brunch and dinner there, they've nailed my burger each time. Darn good, in fact. Same with the fries. Same with the nachos. Really, really good.  But almost anything else, brunch food especially, has been woefully bad. In fact, it is the only restaurant where I have sent a meal back. Ever.   I went shortly after the opened by myself, and I sat at the bar. I ordered the avocado and eggs. The unripened avocado was sort of like putting a knife through the outside of an orange peel, and the eggs that were meant to be runny and soft were nothing more than a hardboiled egg. I decided I'd change my order to a burger. Aside from not charging me for my original order, which was nice, they weren't overly keen to make amends otherwise. That was when it first opened a year ago or so, so I thought it was more of a product of just needing to iron out the kinks. Mistakes definitely happen, and having worked in a restaurant for many years during and after college, I can definitely empathize. I left thinking little of it.  Since then, I'd gone back a couple of times in the evening before a concert or just to kill time while waiting for others. It seemed better.   Then, two Saturday's ago, I had a similar experience to my first. It was, again, during brunch. After well over an hour and after two pretty decent Bloody Mary's, it was quite busy during their rush, our meals arrived. I had ordered the Eggs Benedict two ways, neither of which worked well: the eggs were hardboiled, the hollondaise smears/sauces were dry, and the two types of bread were quite hard/crumbly. The other orders at my table seemed OK, though. Not to worry, I thought. When the waitress came back to check on us, I'd just show her the meal and ask for more sauce, a retire, a change, or whatever seemed fitting.   So she did come back: \"So, how is everything folks,\" she asked.  While casually moving my nearly uneaten plate closer to her, I responded, \"Not quite what I was hoping for.\" (Riveting dialogue, eh?)   Anyway, she said nothing; not a word. She offered a somewhat shrugging, awkward smile, took my plate away, came back with some more water, and that was that. I don't expect or even want a freebie when I go out, but I do appreciate when a place will try to make it right or at least say, \"oh. I'm sorry. Let me see what I can do.\" I didn't complain to a manager or anything, nor did I say anything further to the waitress to this effect, who all-in-all seemed nice, but I do not think I'll be headed back again.   I get why others would want to go here; I really do. However, if you do go go back, or if I do, I'd say really keep it simple with the order. Grab a burger. Grab a BLT. Enjoy an app or two. Have fun with a cryptic beer and some friends; go during a game, after a weekend kick-ball tournament, or whatever. People watch. Beyond that, I'd seek other options. Thankfully the Southside and neighboring neighborhoods can oblige.",

The waiter took a while to get us menus, but after that he was quick to get our orders. We tried the pork nachos. The portion was a bit larger than expected. Overall, it was really well made. The pork just melts in your mouth. I ordered the chicken sandwich. It came with avocados, tomato, and some aioli on the bread (which I think was ciabatta, but I could be wrong.). It came with a hefty serving of fries. Since I'm not legally allowed to drink, I can't give a great review of the bar. From what I've seen, however, the service is pretty good with some interesting cocktails. Overall, The Urban Tap is a fine place to stop for lunch or brunch, and I definitely hope to come back here.",

I saw the reviews of their Bloody Mary bar and we decided to check out Urban Tap. The Bloody Mary bar did not disappoint. They serve your drink and you can pick your accoutrements, ranging from olives, carrots, and salami to fried mac and cheese bites and grilled cheese sandwiches (!) It costs $8 for your first BM and then $6 for each one following, which I thought was totally worth it just for the little plate of appetizers we got out of it. We also ordered a carafe of mimosas, which were decent - they could have been a little stronger IMHO. They have a whole menu of brunch cocktails if you are in the mood to imbibe. The food was pretty stellar - lots of hearty brunch options. I ordered the chicken on a biscuit - fried chicken and an egg on a biscuit topped with gravy with a side of home fries. Everything was delicious, especially the fried chicken which had a nice crunch and was well seasoned. My only gripe was with the biscuit. I'm from the South and we do biscuits in a big way, so I was super excited to eat this biscuit... except it really wasn't a biscuit. Biscuits have flaky layers and are made in a specific way. This I would have called it a roll or a sweetbread. It was still delicious but a bit of a disappointment. The home fries were great and it was plenty of food to take home. The atmosphere was also lovely with the open air windows in front and football on TV - overall a good experience and I look forward to going back.",

It's nothing phenomenal worth raving to everyone I meet about, but definitely somewhere that I would recommend going among the numerous South Side choices. The atmosphere is great, with fast and friendly service.  They have a large number of nicely varied taps (a lot of places this time of year tend to have only beers whose names contain \"Pumpkin\" and/or \"Stout\", not so here), including a cider selection from Arsenal, which is always a nice refresher.  I do feel that the menu could use a little expanding, though I say this partly because the food that they do have is delicious. My last meal there was the BBQ Belly burger, which was a great blend of flavors and cooked to perfection, all set atop an almost-croissant-like flaky bun.  Definitely one of my favorite recent additions to the South Side, I'll be coming back for sure.",

    "text": "What a pleasant surprise!  This has quickly become our neighborhood spot for great food and drinks.  Surprise #1:  Not your typical bar, this gastropub serves up some pretty tasty treats!  I crave the fried tofu sandwich - the crusty bread, pressed tofu, creamy avocado and bosaam sauce really play together nicely.   I recently tried the lamb burger, and I'm pretty sure I could eat the tzatziki out of a bowl...with a spoon...by itself (so delish!)  The burger itself is a generous portion of meat (I couldn't finish it all, and this is unusual for me)  and I would recommend ordering it medium rare - the meat is really fresh and locally sourced  - the chef certainly does it justice! With our many other visits here, we've tried the wings (Monday night, half price!!), mac and cheese (add pork belly, you won't be disappointed), steak sandwich (grilled hanger cooked to perfection), and pork nachos (super citrus slaw, fresh pico, and salty pork really sit together well on a bed of nachos) and saahside chicken dip- all have been super tasty.  Did I mention their fries are some of the best in the city? I have no idea what is in the frites, but order a side...or two... if it doesn't come with your meal! Surprise #2: They have also recently added a stand out Sunday brunch, complete with bottomless mimosas ($14) and a bloody may bar ($8).  As an aside, Pittsburgh needs more bloody mary bars!  I would definitely recommend the Avocado and eggs, but order early, because they have run out of avocado on occasion! What's more to love?  Surprise #3: Their libations.  Their amazing wine list (hello, Simi Cab and Mark West Pinot...on TAP?!) I've never had wine on tap, so this was a bit of a venture for me, but it was great!  They also have a rotating and very large beer list (you'll be sure to find something that suits your taste) and a fabulous cokctail list (our favorite: the Katy Berry) Finally, and perhaps what has made our experience so great at Urban Tap, is Surprise #4: The wonderul service.  We have been to Urban Tap probably twice a month since it opened, and we have never had bad service.  Everyone, from the bartenders, to the waitresses, to the hostesses are extremely friendly and on top of their game.   If you haven't been, now's the time to go! Let's hope Urban Tap is around for the long haul!",

We ordered the poutine and I had the classic burger. Both were very good and the waiter was attentive and friendly. A little on the pricey side but you get pretty large portions in my opinion! Another option would be to order a couple of starters with a group for a good deal! As well, great beer choices and will be back for sure! Hopefully can make It for a happy hour because It seems like an awesome deal too! One last thing the tater tots are these crazy cubes! Tasty and fun to eat!",

I'd say I've had more positive experiences for brunch but dinner was downhill. Not sure for the reasoning. If you are headed here, I'd recommend taking lyft or Uber as parking on this end of Carson can be difficult.  Urban tap a pretty decent brunch menu and the drink selection is great. I'm not a big beer drinker, but they have pretty much whatever beer you can ask for. I do like that they carry white lightening, a local favorite. Can't go wrong with a Katy perry or a raspberry mimosa. O let's are great & very filling. Their menu prices are really reasonable and the atmosphere is nice, an industrial rustic feel. They have plenty of seating with an open floor plan and it's nice when they open up the windows on a sunny day. Not a bad place to check out in the southside.",

I tried the mimosa flight and it was pretty cool! To do once haha. I didn't think they were that amazing but it was neat to have a juice other than orange.   We started off with some House donut holes which were so warm and delicious and perfect! And it was huge so I'm glad we shared. I got the chicken on a biscuit for my entree. The sausage gravy was creamy and not too salty. I asked about subbing the potatoes for tots but was told that I couldn't because the tots weren't ready or a breakfast item haha. Didn't realize a frozen bag of potatoes had a serving window.   All in all this was a great meal with a decent price point. And I surely did not leave hungry!",

They have some daily deals as well such as $5 craft beers on thursdays or half off small plates on tuesdays I think.  The food took a bit to come out. I ordered the big fish on a little roll ($12) with a side of tots while my dad ordered the tap burger ($12) with a side of herbed fries and it was a lot of food. The fish itself had a large coat, but the inside was soft. It didn't have much flavor on its own. The sandwich as a whole tasted much better than the fish on its own. The tots were overfried in my opinion. The burger was good as well, but according to my father, it was so oily he could feel it coating his throat. I guess that's what made it good. The fries were actually quite limp and soft too.  Overall I think I'd come back to try the drinks. The food is standard pub fare with large portions and greasy flavor that probably pairs well with beer. They have a Saturday/Sunday brunch option that seems promising as well.",

I also tried the smoke and spicy bloody mary but the one with clam juice was by far my favorite. For food I had the short rib huevos rancheros and I was really impressed by the presentation and the portion size. The salsa was delicious and I really enjoyed the added texture of the crispy tortilla. I was with a group of six and a few of us wanted something sweet after our savory breakfast but their sweets options for brunch were lacking. We were hoping for a slice of cheesecake or something similar but the only sweets options were on the menu as sweeter entree options.  Overall good experience, we decided to make it a once a month thing to come back and try more things on the menu. Hopefully next time we come the have more dessert options.",

Imagine our surprise when we arrived and there were 5-6 parties in front of us. The hostess just said \"oh...we don't update that.\" So, we had to wait 20-30 minutes. We had already traveled over there and didn't feel like searching for somewhere new.   The food was average- perfectly fine brunch food, but nothing to write home about. My friend asked for cheese on her eggs and they just threw a kraft single on top. I think this is the first time I've ever seen a restaurant serve a meal with a struggle slide on top.   Overall, the experience was not great. 3 stars is pretty generous. Maybe they should stick to being a bar and forget about food until they want to take it more seriously.",

    "text": "I have visited The Urban Tap plenty of times because of the selection of beers but I finally ate there and it was delicious. I had the grilled cheese with pulled pork and it was absolutely delicious. The sandwich was a good portion and I got the fries as a side. They were also good. My boyfriend got the bison burger and it was cooked perfectly. We also got the cheese curds as an appetizer. They were so good and you got a ton. The best part was the sauce. It is a sweet, chunky tomato base. My boyfriend hates tomatoes and he said this was the best thing he ate all day. My boyfriend got the Brussels spouts and they were extra crispy with a really good mustard sauce drizzled all over them. I would highly recommend all of our food selections and can't wait to eat them again the next time we go! Our service was also very helpful and extremely nice.",

    "text": "This place is great.  We stumbled in here for dinner and were amazed at how great this place is.  I want to highlight that they have 7 or 8 taps exclusively dedicated to Founders Brewing Co., which is my absolute favorite. God help me if I ever manage to time a visit to Pittsburgh with a happy hour.  Frank the Tank.  Shutter the windows and hide your valuables everybody.    Our server Sam was very friendly and helpful us navigate the menu with her own personal recommendations. My colleague settled on fancy sliders and I ordered the bison burger.  I can't remember ever eating a bison burger before, but I don't need to remember any other after devouring this one.  It was amazing, perhaps a Top 5 burger in my 36 year-old lifespan.  I was a bit drunk on Founders Breakfast Stout at the time, and I'm really hoping my enjoyment  wasn't just a case of 'beer goggles'. But I will be back.  And I will eat another bison burger.  Most likely slightly to moderately intoxicated again.  Our dinner entertainment was two dudes on guitar covering 90s and early 2000's songs.  Highlight of the set was their gig ender, a cover of Shaggy's 'Angel' song with a guest singer pulled up from the audience.  A very white gentleman who was absolutely spot on imitating Shaggy.  Awesome way to end a great trip to Pittsburgh.",

When we placed our order the server did not write anything down and had to return to the table because he \"blanked\" on my sisters order. 35 minutes and a bug in our water pitcher later we still did not receive our meals. Other tables that arrived after us were already served. We asked the server what was going on and he said they were short staffed and not prepared for how busy it was. My partner got up and went to the line to ask the manager how much longer it would be because we were heading to a concert. He said that a 9 top had really backed them up, then admitted that they lost our ticket but claimed  it was almost ready. There was no sign of our food in the window at all. We had to leave because we could not wait any longer. I understand things happen, however the situation was not handled well at all and it seems to me that our server simply flaked.  Not going to give it another shot.",

The staff was extremely friendly, and the crowd that this place pulls in seems to be in their mid to late 20s. It's not your typical dive bar on the Southside.   The setup of the place was neat and it was really clean, pretty edgy. There's several TVs, and it's a spacious place. Someone in our group pointed out that their draft list on the wall included Beer Advocate ratings, and I thought that was pretty cool. They also have a lot to choose from. I didn't get to chance to try any food, but the people in my group who did seem to like it. The prices are pretty comparable compared to the nicer places on the Southside.   I will definitely return and I would recommend this place.",

We're in our 40s and this is located right in the heart of the South Side bar and club scene. But then we noticed there was a wide range of ages. Phew!  The head hostess, was not welcoming and in fact, was downright unfriendly. I didn't get her name, but she was wearing goth-like eyeliner. Another couple waiting at the bar complained to us about how mean she was. Conversely, the bar staff was professional and hard working, and our server, Nate, was excellent.   This place knows how to cook meat. I had the BBQ brisket burger (which fell apart but was still good) while my husband had the hanger steak burger. He was very happy about the great beers on tap, while I was happy that Arsenal cider was in stock.   It was very busy and loud when we first arrived, but by the time we left, it wasn't as bad.",

Slightly overpriced, but I don't expect cheap craft beer in the South Side.   I wasn't feeling that hungry so after boy ordered his lamb burger, I chose two appetizers, the curry mussels and the pork nachos. I figured that if I didn't like/couldn't finish one of them, either my companion could, or I could take home leftovers.   I was not expecting the size of the nachos. Really delicious! Topped with pork, cheese sauce, and ripe tomatoes and chilies, this appetizer was a big win.  I also enjoyed the mussels.  Cooked perfectly in a panang curry sauce, it had the right combination of spice and flavor.  The mussels were served with a large hunk of fresh baked bread (which I barely touched).  For a hungry person, I'm sure it could have served as a means to sop up the leftover sauce.   Overall, a good experience! I will avoid on the weekend evenings, however.  The Urban Tap seems to be a stop for drunk hipsters on Carson...",

    "text": "i've come here before for a few brews, but yesterday was the first time i ate here as well. i was impressed with the menu, and in fact decided on three dishes i couldn't live without. first, let's talk beers. UT has a relatively expansive draft list. it's always changing, and their craft selection is usually pretty good. yesterday i sampled both the fatheads bumble berry and the dark horse blueberry. the waitress told me about them beforehand and gave me her recommendation, and she was right. the blueberry won me over. before leaving, i also had a river town patrick's poison which i had had before and loved. my date and i split the tofu skewers. nothing particularly special, but pretty good. we got the chimichurri flavor, which i'd get again. then i ordered the duck confit poutine and the chevre spinach salad. i assumed i wouldn't finish both but i had no idea how huge both would be. now, the salad i LOVED. i could eat it three times a week every week and be perfectly content. it came with mounds of gooey goat cheese, spinach, pancetta, a few shaved carrots, and beets and pecans which i did without. it was absolutely amazing, and rather filling. the poutine i wasn't quite as happy with. my first bite, i found a bone... i understand that happens sometimes, but it was a little off-putting. the duck itself was very good, as were the cheese curds. but the fries were already soggy when she brought them out due to the amount of gravy. i know gravy is pretty much the point of poutine, but damn, duck gravy is rich to begin with, this was almost soup with the amount of gravy covering those fries. i'd get it again, but only with gravy on the side. our waitress was very nice, and knowledgable. when i had gone before, we had a bartender that wasn't quite as warm, so i give it up to the servers especially. prices are very reasonable here. i mean, some of the food is kind of fancy and the beers are crafts, so of course it's going to cost a little more, but i think they're all completely fair. i'll be back, for sure!",

The burger was fine (way overcooked) but not memorable.  I was impressed with their seasonal beer selection! It's rare I get to have an Avery seasonal. Yay! However, they need to mention when a beer isn't a 16 ounce pour. I totally get a 9 % ABV may be a smaller pour, but just give a girl a head's up.  All in all, probably won't be back with all the other delicious options on Carson.",

The beer selection was really good.  It had good blend of various seasonal beers.  I tasted a \"sex on the beach\" that was probably one of the best variations of the drink I ever tasted.    Dinners were mixed at table...  Tap Burger - reviews were good Turkey burger - really nice take on this - really good!! Cod - tasted it - really decent sandwich Brisket burger - tasted it as well and it was nice change on regular burger  Lastly, our server (I wished I remembered her name) was awesome!  Bonus of the place is even though on Carson St. there is parking lot right next door.  Haven't been here, worth a stop!!!",

    "text": "I stopped by here last week with my fiance and another couple for dinner.  We arrived shortly before 6 to a pretty dead restaurant.  The wasn't much decor so to speak of from here by that was not a bad thing as the place seemed clean, modern and had a number of TV's around.  There was also a bar on one side of the restaurant which had a list of their draft beers above it as well as their ABV's.   Shortly after we were seated the waitress came over and gave us a beer list and informed us that happy hour was until 6, so if we wanted to get in some small plates for half price that we should do it then.  We obliged and ended up ordering the wild mushroom poutine and the mac and cheese with pork belly even before the other couple got there.  After ordering the food I finally started looking harder at the beer list.  They had a decent number of drafts (25 or so?) as well as a number of seasonal drafts (5) which was impressive to me.  This list much like the sign above the bar had the ABV of the beer but not the price.  As someone who likes to try new beers this is frustrating to me as I don't want to accidentally order that $10 or $15 beer only to hate it.  In any case it didn't really affect my visit other than to have me order a beer from a brewery that I knew was not that expensive.  Within a reasonable amount of time, our food was delivered.  I wouldn't really have called the fries that we got poutine as they didn't have the gravy on top of them which is a quintessential poutine ingredient but they still tasted very good.  The fries were crispy, the mushrooms tasty with the gorgonzola pairing perfectly against the earthiness of them and my favorite part of all was the truffle oil.  The mac and cheese was also good with the pork belly being fried to give it a nice crispiness in addition to its good, natural flavor while the mac and cheese was loaded with great tasting gooey cheese.  Finally whenever we had finished up our appetizers the waitress came around to see if we were ready to order our entrees and we were.  Since the portion sizes of the appetizers were quite large and I had eaten a lot of each, I ended up going with another appetizer for my entree and ordered the Saahside Chicken Dip.  It is essentially a buffalo chicken dip with blue cheese in it and it came with fried naan to use with the dip.  The buffalo dip was good but not spectacular and I loved the fried naan chips which made this dish a little different than many others that I have tried.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  All of the food that I had was good, especially the truffle fries, and were nice sized portions as well.  I was also impressed with their large draft list but wish I knew what I paying for one before the bill came.",

Their Bloody Mary bar is cool and has options like bacon, mini grilled cheese sandwiches, and veggies, which is a lot more than some other brunch Bloody Mary bars. I had the waffle slider for breakfast, and it was a good sized portion and a good value. It had a cool taste, but if you are really hungry, I would recommend getting a larger meal. The only recommendation I would have is to not get the egg over easy if you aren't into over easy eggs (which I'm not). Overall it was a good experience, and I would recommend for brunch!",

The waitress was very helpful on picking a draft from their menu. She even brought samples of some over to the table to try. Ended up with banana nut bread beer, it was amazing not too sweet but tasted like the name.  Food- we had a cheese board  appetizer to go with our half off bottles of wine. So good. The different cheeses, crusty bread and  candied nuts were delicious.  Main dish we all got a vegetarian pasta plate. The noodles are a homemade noodle bought down the strip. Seemed to be the only thing good about that plate. The taste was way too salty, would try something else next time.  Next time I go prob going to try different   appetizers and drinks",

The beers were awesome on tap got a couple of of seasonal brews that were really good I would go back for sure but I live in KC so the chances of me coming back are probably slim to none.",

    "text": "Urban Tap is probably my favorite South Side restaurant/bar. It's always busy, but never wild and out of control and it somehow manages to keep the wild hooligans away on weekend nights. They have a great beer selection (constantly changing) as well as a full bar and menu. The service is always wonderful-- both attentive and friendly. I find the prices to be reasonable and the food is tasty. My absolute favorite dish are the Brussels sprouts with bacon. SO GOOD. The gouda mac n cheese is also great, but leaves little room for anything else. The only food item I'm not a fan of were the pork nachos. They were too spicy (menu doesn't mention spicy) with a skimpy meat portion with toppings on the top chips only. Subpar nachos don't detract from my opinion of the place, they are just not my favorite. Whenever I don't know where to go, Urban Tap is always a solid choice as I know I won't be disappointed and they have something for everyone.",

I was seated at my table during a Pittsburgh Penguins Stanley Cup Playoff Game.... all of the tables around us were watching the game.... because we are in Pittsburgh. A table of 2 asked to change the huge TV in front of us to the Cleveland Browns DRAFT... during a HUGE Pittsburgh playoff game. When I politely asked the waitress not to change the channel, she was extremely rude. Everyone else was watching the game and it was the middle of the 2nd period. The waitress told me she ONLY CARED ABOUT HER TABLE and that I was shit out of luck. Then, my waiter asked US to leave because WE didn't want to move tables. I have never been treated that way as a paying customer in my entire life and I will make sure to NEVER give Urban Tap business ever again.  GO PENS!!!!!!",

    "text": "I've read in Pittsburgh Magazine the best places for brunch, but in my opinion there is no better place in Pittsburgh for brunch than Urban Tap.  I've gone 3 times and each time was better than the last.  Everything is very fresh and delicious and the creativity of the dishes is unparalleled.  We all shared some carafes of mimosa, but I want to focus this review on the food.  I got the eggs benedict-two ways.  One side was a layer of biscuit, homemade sausage and a poached egg and the other side was a layer of cornbread, ham and a poached egg all surrounded by a ring of hollandaise.  The side with the sausage was the best brunch plate I've ever eaten.  A perfect mix of everything you could want in one bite, not to mention the eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise was out of this world.  The only thing I'll say about the other side was that the ham was a little hard to cut into and the cornbread easily fell apart so it wasn't as good of a match (but still tasted delicious).  If you like brunch and you're in Pittsburgh, you have to go to Urban Tap.  Easily accessible in the Southside, but get there quick on Sundays because by 11:15 you'll have to wait.",

Cavernous \"industrial\" look once inside but 3-4 big screens for the TV addicted folk out there.  Long, beautiful bar.  Service at about 5 pm on this Saturday afternoon was fast, courteous, and helpful -- the crowd that was there was very young (to us that are challenged by age).  Waitress and kitchen were fast.  Craft beer selection excellent.  A few with ABV's that are probably NASA substitute for rocket fuel.  I had the Big Hop -- East End Brewing, and my pal tried the house chard -- a Toasted Head.  Well, we actually know about charts and this particular bottle was horrible.  But... we said so and they pulled out a different bottle which was nice.  But but... apparently they are going to carry only one label in chard -- this is a management error since so many people order chard that one does need a selection.  The waitress backed off on the price given this was an \"old\" bottle they don't carry anymore -- but very much better than the Toasted Head initially served.  Ordered two appetizers -- blackened brussel sprouts and a shrimp tempura.  Both were fine.  Service good but not excellent -- for excellent one needs to experience NOLA's group of wait and bar staff.    Two comments:  I am rating this place as OK because it seems the management is too comfortable with the presentation to the public.  Waitresses braiding each other's hair at the hostess station, one chard total?, hallway to the restroom open to a back storage area full of clutter, and the men's restroom was trashed.   But there were plenty of bar staff standing around talking with each other....  So, a nice place to go at the 3 level.  They would benefit from doing live music in the front right corner and turning off the TV's ... really... has everyplace become a SPORTSBAR?    f8 and be there.",

The texture of the meatball was that of a sponge. Gagging just reliving the experience. On another note I ordered the yogurt parfait also and that was great! So the whole entire meal wasn't bad. Probably won't be back for brunch again, and if I do I for sure won't be ordering that meal.",

We made reservations for 11 o'clock and that was a good call on our part, because the bar and tables filled up quickly after our arrival. If you are worried about parking, there is a parking lot right next door which I was lucky enough to find a spot in. The service was great, the food was great and I cannot forget to mention the new mimosa flights they are now offering. The manager actually suggested that I get it and I am really happy he did! The flight was $12 and it came with mango, blueberry, strawberry and regular of course! If you order the carafe of mimosa that will cost you $14 and its just your average mimosa. Why not select the option that gives you some variety. Let me also add that they were not stingy on the booze. That is a win win in my book! Enough rambling about the booze. If you like avocado, I highly suggest getting the avocado and eggs ($11). It comes with poblano pepper hash, corn and black-eyed pea salsa, poached eggs and crispy tortilla chips. Everything tasted so fresh and left me feeling full and satisfied. They definitely do offer a lot of options on their brunch menu and that is nice for a change. If you are not a mimosa fan, you might enjoy the bloody mary bar. If you are in the mood for something sweet, you might enjoy the french toast or Belgian waffles. Make this spot your next stop for brunch!",

Luckily, the happy hour crowd had disbursed and there was room to breath as well as grab a bar stool and enjoy a beer and sandwich before the show began.   The Urban Tap is a long narrow bar with the high ceilings and exposed pipes and air conditioning ducts that seem to be something restaurants don't mind you seeing. It works in the Urban Tap because the building is so old and you'd expect it. The light fixtures add a bold look to the classy but relaxed atmosphere.   Fellow YELPER and friend, Kevin C joined me. He enjoyed a happy hour priced mixed drink and I had an IPA from the tap. Looking over the menu, not as diverse as one would think, settled on a chicken sandwich, grilled and loaded to the gills with creamy avocado and thinly sliced sandwich vegetables. Very nice presentation with a side of vegetables. Overall it wasn't bad, this place won't turn into a regular spot for me. Parking is side street or on Carson Street. Friendly and courteous staff, stop in before the curtain rises.",

    "text": "New spots on East Carson always seem to be a shot in the dark. They range from spectacular to meh. I was pleasantly surprised by The Urban Tap. The pub offers a wide range of foods and different cocktails, and I felt feeling a lot better about the spot than I had coming in.   The Urban Tap has a massive draft list that is constantly changing. The draft list is so large, I didn't bother to find a bottle list (I'm not sure if there is one). In addition to draft beer, the bar also offers draft wine, which I've never seen before. I took a quick glance at the cocktail menu and that looked tasty too!   My table started out with an order of Mac & Cheese to share. The plate was above average, with a light but satisfying smoked gouda sauce. It wasn't so rich that I was sick after a few bites, but a couple of forkfuls to share left me wanting more!  I ordered the Chicken Sandwich to start, the baguette is loaded with grilled chicken, avocado, siracha aioli, and red pepper and pineapple salsa. The sandwich was good, but not overly flavorful. For all the unique ingredients, I was surprised how blah it was.   Everyone else at my table enjoyed their meal more. One of our party ordered the sliders, and I saw a bunch of those going out. I think next time, I'd stay safe with a burger, or try one of the salads--those look pretty tasty.   Like I said, I was pleasantly surprised with the whole place. There is a ton of space, with a bunch of mixed table sizes for varying groups. On a Sunday evening, it wasn't too loud, but I wouldn't want to be there on a Friday/Saturday night. That being said, I think I'd give it another try for lunch or a weekend brunch.",

I am not typically so blunt but I have gone three times without reviewing and now I have to say something because I keep accidentally coming back because people speak so highly of this place that I actually forget that thing I don't like is the food. The service is pretty good, the people are definitely friendly, the parking situation is better than most places in the southside, the vibe is cool, the drink selection is strong but the food just doesn't taste good.... at least not for brunch. I have tried the French toast, the chicken and waffles, the shrimp and grits, and the House donut holes. None would put this among the better breakfast or brunches in Pittsburgh. I love a hot and fresh donut hole as much as the next person so if you'd like that an a hot coffee the portion and price are solid, but honestly just dine elsewhere, again at least for brunch....this is not a gem of the Pittsburgh early afternoon scene.",

Featured bacon, ham, olives, cucumbers, peppers, and GRILLED CHEESE SQUARES! For my meal I had the avocado and eggs, very tasty and filling, I couldn't finish all of the potato has and pico de gallo that came with it. My husband ordered the daily omelet that he devoured. The service was attentive, our waitress was prompt in bringing beer tasting and checking in on us. However, I think she thought we were tourists... asked us what we had planned that day and suggested checking out the incline... odd, but not a deterrent to come back for brunch again.  As for dinner we came on Valentine's day and had the special of prime rib for two, w/ a side of brussel sprouts--so flavorful and rich without being overwhelming. We had leftovers for the next day, very generous portions.  One negative I have about the Urban Tap is that it gets LOUD when there's a full house. The front seating area is kind of like a pit if  you don't have a taller table next to the front windows. I've not been seating in one of the back \"booths\" but I'm thinking its a quieter back there and would definitely recommend requesting a table towards the back if you're making reservations.",

There's a parking lot beside of the restaurant, which is great if you're terrible at parallel parking like me. Free parking on Sundays in the lot.   We ordered carafes of the mimosas, as I'm not much of a tomato juice fan, but the bloody mary bar looked interesting. I had the avocado and eggs: both eggs were wonderfully poached and delicately placed on top of both halves of an avocado. The poblano hash was decent, but I was expecting more flavor, or at least more of a kick.   If you're down for trying eclectic spins on classic brunch dishes, try The Urban Tap.",

    "text": "We went to the Urban Tap this past Sunday for Brunch.  I LOVE brunch... The only early meal that's not only acceptable to booze, but encouraged!  After searching a few other Brunch stops we agreed we were intrigued by their menu.  What initially was going to be a group brunch turned into an intimate meal with my husband and friend Chelsea S in the good ole Saaahside.    Parking here was so convenient, something not to be taken for granted in the South Side.  There is a lot basically right next to the restaurant that is free on Sundays.  We arrived shortly after noon, the atmosphere was very nice, modern, and I absolutely loved the open windows at the front of the place giving it a lovely airy feeling on a beautiful pre-autumn day.  I already cheated, as I usually do, and studied the menu online prior to brunch so I was pretty set on what I was going to order, as was the hubs.  Please note, the menu provided online is not exactly correct and does need updated.  For instance, they no longer offer bottomless mimosas.  You can order a carafe for $10.00 which gives you about 5-6 glasses.  I also noticed their online menu mentions pork belly in a few dishes but their actual menu has no such reference.  All was ok, as we order a carafe of mimosas which turned into 3 carafes before we concluded.  I chose the Breakfast Pierogie Saute, as the H got the Eggs Benedict two ways.  Both dishes online said \"pork belly\" but in house it was I believe sausage in mine and a cured ham in his.    The wait staff was pleasant, efficient, and never let us wait long for service.  Our food came out in a reasonable time, actually almost perfect for brunch meaning not too quick, but not too long, so we had time to chat and drink and enjoy the leisure of Sunday Brunch like one should.  When our meals were served they did not disappoint.  My saute as I can detail contained a type of hash mixed saute veg and sausage, with a nice balance of sweet and heat, topped with two plump pillow pierogies, laying underneath two sunny side up eggs finally topped with some mustard.  The richness of the egg yolk when cut through rolled throughout the dish coating all elements that lay beneath.  It was quite delectable, perfect portion, at a very reasonable price.  I tried the eggs benedict and it was also really good, but I would have liked more hollandaise as it was mostly drizzled on the eggs.  The cornbread base was unique.  Never had a benny prepared like that.  Again very distinctive and original.     We stayed for a couple hours enjoying our food and drinks, actually long enough that many people were filtering in for the lunch fare.  We noticed many other dishes coming out that looked amazing and smelled even better.  I think I will have to come back here to try their other menus soon...",

I brought tons of friends for drinks and they all loved it, too. The crew went above and beyond to accommodate my family and my two little boys with chicken fingers and chocolate milk when we visited on a Saturday evening. (Zack rocks!)  The beer selection accommodates every mood and taste. I was a fan of a jalapeno mule they customized for me. Best service ever! Thee industrial decor and perfect tunes make this a great place for lunch, a little work and dinner. They have outlets for your phone under the bar.  The menu - I tried many choices... house salad with salmon, curried tofu, popcorn with truffled bacon, pork nachos, burger, brussel sprouts, broccoli and cheddar soup, cream of mushroom soup...all very good. Sunday Brunch is insanely amazing! The avocado eggs were delicious and the bloody mary bar on steroids with grilled cheese and mac and chees bites, charcuterie in addition to the usual pickled accompaniments. Just. So. Good!  My favorites are the popcorn and the salad with salmon. The pork nachos are amazing but make sure the pork is hot - it was cold one time I got it and ruined the dish.  The caprese sandwich with  bacon they are trying for the fall menu is my favorite - It comes as a wrap now - they added turkey and pesto to it but I still like the first iteration with balsamic, tomatoes and mozzarella on a toasted fluffy ciabatta - simple and perfect. I am still hoping they add the Chackwich to the menu - the two super cute bartenders ( Chad and Zack) - with me in the middle. Kidding aside - the service is phenomenal.  John and his crew have done a great job. I hope to see more Urban Taps in other parts of the city.  I will note there is a great gym - Met Performance  -behind The Tap - you'll need it if you  loved the UT as much as I did.",
