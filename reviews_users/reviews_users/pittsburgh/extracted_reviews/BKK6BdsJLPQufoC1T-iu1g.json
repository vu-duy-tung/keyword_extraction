I had a gorgonzola steak dish, which was perfect for me because I like blue cheese. We had plenty to eat and took some leftovers home.  I thought the wine list was good with a variety of selections that you don't see everywhere.   The atmosphere is charming, and the valet parking is much appreciated given the odd parking lot.",

    "text": "Don't go for the pork Milanese. Their signature dish is not at all flavorful and while it was quite tender it lacked any sense of uniqueness. It's overwhelmed by bland breeding. For the $65 price you should have a much better dish and this one falls far, far short of a great restaurant experience. The steak Diane was much more tasty and a very good dish. Have also seen positive comments on the pasta with vodka sauce. But I must say its pretty unremarkable and if anything was uninspirational.  Wait staff was very good and attentive. I'm sure they Have other good dishes but I think you can do better for your money and get a better dish at other area places.",

We tried 4 of the appetizers. My favorite was the meatball. Cooked perfectly with amazing flavor and texture.  My main dish was the veal chop. You cannot go worng ordering this and I would absolutelyorder it again.  We each had a small dish of the alfredo pasta that was made at our table in the cheese wheel. This was the best alfredo sauce I have ever had!  Can't wait to go back again!",

I went with a party of 5 and the bill, with a few cocktails was a little over $600.  BUT -- we all had a nice evening and took home enough food to have dinner the next night.  3 of the people in my party had the veal shank and they loved it.  It looked like something from the Flintstones it was so large.  I had fluke with crab and it was delicious.  For appetizers we shared the giant meatball (it was) and the smoked provolone.  The provolone I would have again, but I would try something else instead of the meatball.  Make reservations because the night we went it was packed.  I can't wait to go again!",

Shared the mussels & baked artichoke hearts for hors d'oeuvres. The crusty bread was perfect for dipping into the spicy tomato sauce that the mussels were simmered in. My husband really enjoys the addition of marinated beets to the house green salad. A primo piatto of fusilli in a vodka sauce was just enough to whet the appetite for the outstanding Veal Milanese served with lump crab in a lemony butter reduction. We were all unable to finish our main course & took plenty of leftovers home to savor. Even though we were more than full, my son ordered tiramisu in honor of my birthday. It was creamy, light & truly divine with a luscious raspberry filling. Our server was helpful, pleasant & most attentive. The place was hopping for a Monday night. Loved it!",

There are equally as good, as well as far better restaurants in terms of cuisine in Pittsburgh and many don't come close to the price points of Arlecchino.  The veal chop is one of the best meals I have ever eaten, but in no way is the $65 cost justifiable. Coming from a 100% Italian family and having spent a good deal of time in various regions of Italy, the menu isn't what I would consider authentic Italian food. Our last visit was made wonderful by not only the food, but by our amazing waiter, Carl. Aside from the pricing, we don't care for being sent to the bar to wait when we've made reservations. Seems like a money making ploy and this practice is not a trait expected from a finer restaurant.",

    "text": "Second try now that they have lowered corkage.  Good, but does not live up to the hype the owners attempt to create.  Arrived promptly for our 8:30pm reservation on a Saturday night.  There is no hostess station - you walk through a door immediately into the dining room.  Can you say awkward?  After a couple of minutes, someone finally noticed us and pointed us towards the upstairs bar as \"our table was not quite ready\".  Thirty minutes later we were seated - which was a relief as the bar is very small and crowded and very, very noisy.  I'd give it three stars for atmosphere.  Too noisy and too crowded and the lack of a hostess station upon entering is terrible.  Service - our waiter arrived promptly and apologized for our wait.  Menus were delivered, bottled water ordered, wine opened and poured and bread dropped off.  It should be noted that the stems for the wine are cheap and generic - same stem for red and white.  Hard to bill yourself as an upscale spot with cheap stems.  The waiter returned and offered a few suggestions.  We decided on the cheese plate to start.  It is described as a daily selection of three cheeses.  When it was delivered, I inquired as to what types of cheeses they were.  The waiter did not know and had to check with the kitchen.  He returned and named the cheeses without providing any information on type of mile, sharp or mild, etc.  I like to be informed when I dine out.  Missed the ball on that.  A good, but uninspired salad arrived next, after a substantial wait.  Certainly nothing special about it.  It was served family style, which left one of us picking around the beets.  Next up was - again - a good but ordinary pasta served with vodka sauce.  Again, served family style.  A little bowl of grated parmigiano reggiano was left on the table - guests could serve themselves I guess.  I prefer mine freshly grated tableside and that is what I expect when paying $40-$50 per entree.  After another long wait the entrees arrived.  Once again (broken record huh?) good, but not exceptional.  Portion size is big, but I would prefer more healthily portions (i.e., smaller).  Service = three stars; Food = four stars.  Arlecchino's biggest issue remains the attitude of the owners and staff.  They seem to believe they offer the best dining experience in the South Hills and they are sadly mistaken.  Several other restaurants in the area offer equal or better dining experiences - some at lesser costs.  Dinner for three - with two corkage fees - was $175.  I don't mind spending that - I just want value in return.",

The bar...second floor walk up, cozy, friendly and very comfortable. The restaurant...love it...great space, open and airy, tables not crammed one on top of the next. The food is very good. We started with the smoked provolone and the bruschetta. The smoked provolone is sublime. I chose the veal Milanese which is a double chop pounded thin and sauteed with pine nuts, lump crab meat and some tart lemon...this is huge and so tender you can almost cut it with your fork. The crab is fresh and compliments the lightly breaded veal...sort of a twist on surf and turf. My dining companion chose the filet with Gorgonzola cream, also very flavorful and perfectly cooked...medium well...just like she ordered it ( a travesty in my opinion but then I wasn't eating it!). The house salad and the fusilli pasta w/ vodka sauce are both good. The salad has roasted beets which makes it delicious in my book!

Then a  cream cheese/marscapone layer. (not sure the exact ingredients)  It is thick and creamy and amazing.  Then a raspberry Chamborde layer.  Sweet and fruity!  Then the layers repeat and it is topped with crispy sweet almonds.  OMG!  I love this dessert.  The serving is really big, and as much as I love everything on the plate, I still share with my husband because it is a big portion.  My husband and I had this dessert as our wedding cake, that's how much I love it!    Ok, I'll calm down.    This restaurant is the sister to Alla Famiglia, and is set up in a similar style.  Meaning: Lots Of Food.  They bring bread to the table with a pepper oil.  It is tasty, but I try not to eat any to save room.  They offer many starters, although I recommend skipping this too.  Your dinner comes with salad and pasta!  It is a ton of food.  The salad is really yummy with raisins and sunflower seeds.  The pasta is really great too!  Creamy vodka tomato sauce?  Yes, please.  The dinners change up a bit.  I had a sea bass.  It was covered in huge chunky of crab and a delicious sauce.  The fish was really fresh. My husband got the double thick veal chop.  (He managed to eat the whole thing, although I am not sure how!?!)    For dessert......oh wait, I already went over that.  They have a few other options, but why kid yourself?!?     Our service was great.  I would definitely recommend a reservation!  It is not a huge place, but it is popular.",

Tried to have a great romantic experience here but was essentially rushed through dinner. My wife and I laughed afterwards. We didn't mind the prices, but it seems like they didn't want to ensure repeat business.  Tip: please try to train a little friendliness into your staff from reservations to the servers, especially for people who try out the restaurant for the first time. Or tip to customers: don't tell your server that it is your first time there or you may be talked down to and rushed out the door.",

Four of us went on a Saturday night to celebrate a successful business result.  It was Saturday so yes it was jammed.  We were seated within 10 minutes of our 8 pm reservation, nice. Staff was friendly in a down to earth style.  Waitstaff was very attentive and non-intrusive.  No greeter at entrance was awkward. We really appreciated the suggestions from our waitress.   Food portions were large, as in \"Jersey diner\" sort of way.  Appetizers were excellent, mussels rocked.  Portions were more than enough. I don't eat veal but two people at our table did and raved about it.  My lamb was great.  When I made reservations I was asked if this was a special event.  Liked that.  With two drinks our bill with tip, was expensive for Pittsburgh, $400+ , but it was a special occasion.",

    "text": "Born in Pittsburgh But for the last few decades now live in San Fran Bay Area. So coming back, I was thrilled to discover this amazing gem of a restaurant off of Hwy 19 in Peter's Township. An old 1 room schoolhouse updated to a bistro style open kitchen filled with the delightful aromas of fresh, homemade deliciousness. Their Chop Milanese is perfection on a plate... Easily big enough to split the double chop with someone and still have leftovers. Their classic starters of homemade meatballs, hot stuffed peppers, and their Arancini (which are more patty shaped than the usual rice ball shapes) are exceptional. For their included pasta course, go the extra mile for they table side mixed white pasta con Pepe ...I won't spoil the surprise but trust me, it's worth it! Went there twice in the same week. Bravissimo.",

    "text": "Complimentary valet was very nice. The meatball and sauce was excellent. The sauteed calamari was ok..it was actually slightly over cooked which makes them the texture of rubber bands. Some of the pieces where done perfect. The linguine and white clam was good, but really nothing special. We had so many left overs and we just split the pasta dish. We did still opt to try a very unique Tiramisu, made with chambord and vodka instead of coffee. It wasn't bad but I'm a big fan of Tiramisu and it's better with espresso. The service was good and the wait staff was very nice. But the price is not worth it. I'm willing to pay $100 for 2 appetizers 1 pasta dish, 1 dessert and 2 glasses of wine, if it knocks my socks off.. this was just good. And I forgot the really weird part. This was our first time here so we weren't familiar with the place and when we first walked in, we were literally standing in the dining area, for what felt like 10 minutes, and no one even greeted us. My over all opinion is if you have really deep pockets and service is more important than the taste of the food or your looking to impress someone it might be worth it to visit. But for me I think it was way over priced for what we had, although  I might go back for just the meatball and sauce. That was really good. Sorry, I had to give 3 stars, but I really think you could have something here, if you read the reviews and take some of the tips.",

The service (rich) was great, the side room we ate in cozy, and Brandi, the owner was a friendly and gracious host.

Definitely non-traditional with no coffee flavor to ruin this perfect dessert!!! Highly recommend for a great date night or special occasion.",

The complimentary pasta with vodka sauce and the pepper olive oil is close to the best pasta I have tasted (other than my own).

Brandy the GM and owner gave us a tour of the outside dining area before we left. Ok.. Now about the food which is why we were there. We started with a bruschetta and eggplant parm appetizers. The eggplant was tender and the sauce and cheese fabulous. The bruschetta was good.. If we had not been spoiled by the bruschetta you get at Mia Madre's in Kennedy I would have said better than good. The table side preparation of Cacio e Pepe should not be missed. My wife ordered a filet covered with a Gorgonzola sauce that was perfect. I had the veal Milanese which is huge and so so delicious. We brought our own wine that went well with our meals and was happy to pay the $20 per bottle corkage.. being a first timer  it was no big deal.   Needless to say, we had lots of leftovers and suggest you go with a larger group of friends so you can sample more of the apps and different meals.   Can't wait until the next time!",

You must try the meatball- to die for! We also had the beef carpaccio which was also very delicious. The next course was a fabulous salad that had beats, golden raisins, Suns flower seeds, and a subtle yet delicious salad dressing. Up next, was a delicious bowl of pasta and after that we had a steak which alone could have fed my husband and I. Needless to say we had lots of leftovers the next day.  I have a two-fold reason why I gave it 3 stars. I have eaten at this restaurant several times because the food is great and it's in my neighborhood, that being said the food is extremely overpriced. You can figure that for food alone it's gonna cost about $100/person which is capital grill kinda pricing.   The difference between this restaurant and capital grill however is that capital grill's staff is quick and efficient. Each and every time we come here they never find our reservation and make us wait around to be seated. The wait staff is very friendly but they're usually all running around like crazy trying to keep up with the tables. The environment isn't very ritzy either.  If you ask people to pay lots of money... It should be a full and complete experience...and it's just not there yet.  I'm still rooting for you Arleccinos!",

We sat at 5:30 and observed a table behind us at the bar unoccupied we left at 7pm.  Drinks were good to average for the $16 pour on a Manhattan and Comso.  First course of salad was a good mix of greens and red beats with raisins, but take it easy on the dressing.  Second course was a dish of pasta with red vodka sauce, that was average to the taste.  The oil that accompanied the pasta was never explained by the bartender or server.  Wife ordered the Linguine with Red Clam Sauce ($36); 20 oz of pasta with partial clams and an average red sauce.  I ordered the NY Strip medium rare ($60) that was 21 dry aged; it came out Med Well, which was corrected by the server after I asked the bartender to take it back.  I picked off some of my wife's pasta while I would have loved another drink, but the bartender was not observant enough to even offer.  My steak came back out - Medium Rare on the sides and Rare in the middle, I wasn't about to send it back a third time so I had it wrapped up to go.  You could do better at Ditka's or Hyde Park for the price of this steak.  NO offer of additional drinks or even shown a desert menu.  Glad we had a gift certificate for our 23rd Anniversary, we won't becoming back.  Valet parking - what a joke didn't even bring the car around they parked it, pulled it out and let the customer walk through the lot to the car.  If you are in the South Hills and what good Italian go to Armstrongs or DeLallo's",

They had a Sirloin served Diane style (mushroom and onion sauce) but I wanted the Filet. They were easily accommodating. The server said any steak on the menu could be served Diane. Prepare to take home leftovers and remember to leave room for your entree, it's hard to do!  Mondays are no corkage fee. Came here for our anniversary and brought wine from our trip to France. They even made us special menus with anniversary wishes printed at the top. Nice touch!   The only thing that I wasn't impressed with was our servers lack of wine knowledge. Glad we brought our own. The server we had during last visit had a great knowledge of wine, so I'll let these cancel each other out this go.",

    "text": "Dinner was superb, which we expected as Alla Famiglia is still one of the best evenings we've had in awhile. This restaurant is housed in an old schoolhouse, with gorgeous, original hardwood floors and high ceilings. Definitely take a moment to gaze up at the blackboard, which was original to the schoolhouse as well. The kitchen is an open concept, with a beautiful diamond patterned stainless steel background. I loved the ambiance, but it can get very loud because of the high ceilings and open concept. Fantastic for a boisterous group dinner but not quite the right setting if you're looking for a more quiet, romantic night out. The food was fantastic, I adore their pasta with a vodka sauce, but the highlight was actually when the chef refused to serve something. Let me back up, our friend ordered the tuna and around the pasta course the server explained that the chef was not happy with the tuna and wanted to talk to her about it. So the chef took the time to come out and speak to her about different options and how he could prepare a different fish for her. I was blown away that he took the time to come out and say the product was unsatisfactory and offer options to rectify the situation. Absolutely superb customer service and we really appreciated it!!!  All in all we would absolutely return based solely on the knowledge that the chef takes great pride in what he serves to guests and refuses to serve something subpar! Kuddos!!!",

My drink was iced tea and it was superb, clear and crisp. The bread was warm and crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and went perfectly with the dipping sauce, oil with pepper. Their entrees come with a salad and pasta so I did not have and appetizer which I didn't miss due to the hearty and tasty dishes before the meal.  I used the oil that Wendy recommended for a little extra kick to the pasta, evoo infused with peppers. My entree was the steak diane and it was cooked perfectly and tasted delightful. I have no hesitation in giving a five star rating. It was exceptional.",

Arlecchino features a Tuesday Family Night-its really quite awesome that they offer this- 2 different chicken dishes to choose from for an outrageously affordable price. Our neighbors told us about it, and we were floored! We think you are a 5+ in what you offer and appreciate the great pains you take to train staff to provide such exemplary service. The Cheese with Pasta (Cacio di Pepe) is Amazing-      You do so much---lost art kind of things       You are a 5+",

We shared the stuffed meatball and then the veal parmigiana and Bolognese pasta. We took home about half of the pasta (veal came with its own pasta course) but this seemed to be the perfect quantity for 2 people (we were pleasantly full!) I loved that it was served in courses and the timing was PERFECT. We had time to enjoy bread and oil before the meatball came....time to enjoy that and have some space before the salad came etc. So many places get the timing so very wrong...you wait forever and a day for a salad (how long does it really take to make a salad?!) and then before you finish it your dinner arrives. Also everything came out hot! Just perfect. Our food was amazing and after smelling and seeing other guests dishes, we can't wait to return. (The smoked provolone smelled particularly wonderful!) Thanks for putting this wonderful gem in the south hills!! It's nice not to have to go downtown for an experience and food like this!",

    "text": "When you want the best Italian cuisine in the South Hills area of Pittsburgh, maybe all of Pittsburgh, this is where you go. For most of us it is a special occasion restaurant, because it is not inexpen$ive. But the appetizers alone are worth the price. (I know some who make their meals out of the appetizers alone.) I tried to avoid ordering the appetizers this time, because there is So Much Food, but fortunately, I failed. We shared the meatball appetizer, which is a worthy perennial favorite, and the tuna tartare, which was amazing in a way that is beyond description. If it is available when you're there, please don't miss it. Then, after the salad course we opted for the pasta Caccio e Pepe (please pardon any misspelling; it means the pasta is served table-side with cheese, cream and pepper). We could have gone with the standard pasta with red sauce, or half and half of both. But this preparation is exceptional and we love it. We all ordered the Veal Milanese  for our entrees. Delicious barely begins to describe this dish. Wonderful is an understatement. We all brought home leftovers. Nonetheless, we shared a flourless chocolate cake dessert. It was a brilliant, smooth finish to a marvelous meal. Dinners here are leisurely, 2-2 1/2 hours. That doesn't mean service is slow or inattentive; our server was excellent. If you put this restaurant on your wishlist, you won't be disappointed.",

We had reservations and were seated immediately, but not waited on until everyone arrived.   The food was phenomenal, and I almost never use that word. You could really tell that everything was homemade. My only \"complaint\" would be that I didn't split a meal, because one meal was WAY too much food.   I had a mahi mahi with shrimp, and it was really good. We also had both the cheese bowl pasta and the regular vodka sauce. I liked both of these... I don't know what I would pick if we weren't all sharing, but I suggest doing the cheese bowl at least once. We also tried all 3 desserts, but the tiramisu was by far the best.  I suggest sharing an entree but getting individual salad and pasta courses... This is your best bet for sure. Great food!",

    "text": "So this review comes after our umpteenth visit! We had a last minute chance at a great date night that coincided with our anniversary, so it's Arlecchino for the win. I sent an email via their site to get a reservation, with a special request for our favorite server. The owner Brandy got back to me quickly, confirming our reservation and letting us know we'd also have Christa as our server! (Woooo hoooo!) it's going to be another great meal at Arlecchino! We got there about 10 minutes early and we were greeted immediately and seated. Then Emily (hey, you're not Christa!?!) came over and said she'd be taking care of us. We've never had anything but amazing service here but we requested a server and were told we'd have that server. We sort of looked at each other and said , oh well, I'm sure she'll be fine. Then Christa walked by, noticed us and she said hey! We told her that we had requested her and while we were talking Emily came back. We said it really wasn't a big deal etc and Christa definitely looked busy. Emily was awesome and very helpful, we had drinks and our special anniversary menus in no time. A few minutes later Emily came back and said her and Christa talked and they were going to switch tables so Christa could take care of us (YaY!)  She also said Christa was pretty backed up at the moment and took our appetizer order and got another round of drinks.   I couldn't tell you how many times we've been here, we even have our Christmas party here but literally in the dozens and dozens of meals we've had here every single experience has been stellar!  We measure all Italian restaurants against Arlecchino and they are by far the reigning champions. Our favorite dish is the seafood fra diavlo, huge portions of amazing seafood, lobster, crab, muscles, scallops, in a deliciously spicy red sauce (man, I'm still stuffed from tonight and this sounds amazing) The pasta course is indescribably delicious. I really can't say enough about how much we love the food and service here. Tonight we decided to try some new dishes, the ahi tuna with a scallion butter sauce was delicious and my wife had the Chilean Sea Bass, she shared a bite and it was probably the best bite of fish that I've ever had!  If you're looking for an amazing meal go here!  Amazing food, amazing service, and in the South Hills, what more could you ask for? Oh yeah, the coolest ceiling fans around!",

    "text": "I had a horrible dinner there last night. The salad had rancid sunflower seeds in it and was soggy from too much dressing. The pasta was good but our party of five adults shared a bowl so I had about 1/2 cup. Not enough for me. I usually have a cup of pasta as a serving. I  had the worst chicken. Are two bites and couldn't eat another bite. It tasted like they put a meat tenderizer powder in it ... it was a pasty, almost pre digested texture. The breading was soggy and flavorless. My son ordered the ny York strip. Once again a very unpleasant texture. He also couldn't finish it because it was unpleasant. As for the veal parm, I've had better veal parm at ny metro area puzzarias on the cheap. They use slices provolone as the cheese which smelled yucky and tasted sour. $400 for a family of five (no appetizers) was just too much to pay to not have good food. I am just astounded and can't even believe what crappy food we had for extortionate prices will never go back",

    "text": "The food at Arlecchino is a solid 5 stars, but I had to dock a star for a few reasons...  My husband and I spent our anniversary at Arlecchino. When I called to make the res, the guy asked if we were celebrating anything. I told him it was our anniversary, and  I was pleasantly surprised to walk in and the host wish us a happy anniversary and then see our names on the giant chalk board over the kitchen.  This place is a sister restaurant of Alla Famiglia in Pittsburgh. The menu & food, is exactly the same, which is excellent. However, Arlecchino is more casual inside. The space is small and I felt very crammed. There is no hostess stand, so as soon as you walk in the door you awkwardly have to stand next to someone dining and wait for the host to run over. We were seated next to a 10 top, and our tables were only inches a part. I wouldn't go expecting a romantic evening alone. Because Alla is more upscale and and the prices are the exact same, I'd recommend going there over the McMurray location. I was also missing the sorbet pallet cleanser between the courses :(  We've had the meatball appetizer at Alla and loved it, so we ordered it last night. It was supposed to be stuffed with mozzarella, but they must have forgot  :( ours didn't have cheese in it.  Our server was fantastic. I am sad I didn't catch her name for a shout out. My husband got the famous veal chop (highly highly highly recommend) and I got the Gorgonzola filet which was also delicious and a nice size. Our meals were served with a salad and pasta before hand, but I really wish my steak came with a vegetable. The salad is fantastic. Love everything about it!! Our server told us we could choose between cacio e pepe or pasta al la vodka. We couldn't choose and asked her which is better. She explained that we each get a side so we should just get both! So that's what we did! But she did fail to mention the cacio e pepe is a $5 upcharge. I was also kind of expecting to get some kind of dessert or something for our anniversary. I've never been to a nice restaurant who doesn't give you a \"happy anniversary\" dessert.  In conclusion, will I go back to Arlecchino? YES. would I drive past Alla Famiglia to go to Arlecchino instead? No.",

    "text": "What a find!   We went here last night & were totally impressed. To have a place of this quality hidden away in the South Hills area--who knew???  The meatball appetizer is a thing of wonder! It's definitely large enough for two or could be an entree on its own. Meat & mozzarella & lots of tomato sauce. DELICIOUS!   I had the seafood diavalo & it was amazing too. Lobster & jumbo shrimp & large scallops & clams & mussels & oh my! All of this is in a spicy red sauce that has a serious kick. Excellent!   My only regret with the food is that the servings are so large that we got stuffed. This is partly because the seafood came with a salad that was very good & a vodka pasta course that I only ate a few bites of. Next time, we will order the meatball & one entree only. Last night my husband ordered the tagliatelle but we brought virtually all of it home to eat today.   The setting is fun too, as the restaurant is in s charming old church.   I need to add that the prices are high. The meatball was $13 & my seafood was $58. Also, they charge $15 if you share an entree.",

Upon entering, I noticed that my name was posted on the chalkboard, wishing me a happy Birthday. It was a nice evening and we had patio seating. We were greeted warmly by our waitress and were presented with warm bread and olive oil with herbs that was very good. Wine was ordered from their extensive wine list. We all ordered entrees which included, veal, seafood, and pasta dishes. At table-side, I had a pasta dish that was included as my side. It consisted of fettuccine and that was mixed inside a wheel of cheese and mixed with cream. It was to die for!  All of our entrees were wonderful and cooked to perfection. Waitstaff is very knowledgeable on all offerings.  The menu was even personalized with my name and birthday wishes. I was a great evening.",

We started with the prosciutto wrapped shrimp which were finished with a 15 year aged balsamic on a bed of arugula, which had a great taste, crispy on the outside and soft and succulent in the center. The house salad and pasta, which are accompaniments of your entree were mastered by using a wide array of ingredients, from the romaine and beet salad with golden raisins and goat cheese and the Cacio e Pepe, which was prepared tableside, it was delightful. My bistecca diane was cooked a perfect medium rare, this grass fed steak with Worcestershire butter and sauteed wild mushrooms and onions was on point, one of the best steaks I have had. Finally our server Rachel was top notch, not only did she meet all of our wants and needs and exceed them, she went above and beyond when my leftover steak was boxed up and accidentally left behind, she called me as I was almost home, told me she would bring it to my house and drop it off when she got off, as she lived right by me. That is top tier service and someone who is dedicated to her craft in the service industry. If you are in the Pittsburgh area and in need of great Italian food or a great steak, this is your place.",

    "text": "I can't even begin to say enough good things about Arlecchino. This is the second location of Alla Famiglia (on Mount Washington) located in the McMurray area. I'm a huge fan of Alla Famiglia, and Arlecchino is every bit as impressive, if not a little more. From my experience, both restaurants offer the same menu, and they both have incredible quality. I really love Arlecchino in particular because of the location. The restaurant is located inside a converted old school house, making the dining experience completely unique. I've never had a bad meal here (and trust me, I've been here a lot over the years). My favorite items on the menu are the beef carpaccio, the veal chop Milanese, the Cottoletta del Monzu, the smoked provolone, the eggplant parmigiana, and the Cacio e Pepe. The cacio e peppe is an especially Italian dish (one of my very favorites while i lived in Florence that consists of pecorino romano cheese, pepper, and butter) and it's very hard to come by in the United States. The beautiful thing about Arlecchino is that you will have an incredible dinner regardless of what you order. It's worth every penny so I definitely suggest giving it (or Alla Famiglia, depending on which is closer to you) a shot!",

We are not picky eaters, and we try not to send things back unless it's absolutely horrid, we just don't operate that way. I also heard a million great things about this place, so I'm guessing it was just a bad day.  Therefore, 3 stars instead of 1...plus the service was pretty good, until I asked the waiter to look at my side of rock hard, undercooked potatoes.     Someone heard me say my steak was over-cooked I believe, so someone came out and asked me to cut my steak down the middle to be sure it was the correct temp.   It was not, and they offered to send out a new one.  I declined to do it, but regretted it.  It was tough to cut, tough to eat, and this was not due to temp, I assure you.   Took it home and put it in a pan with butter the next morning.  Still wasn't good.   We had a good laugh at our luck on Friday the 13th, and my Mother's 75th Birthday, with how much money they charge.   I would not go back unless I hear something was off that day, like a sick Chef that had to take the night off...and that it had been corrected.    The Family Style Insalata and Primi Pasta were excellent and the smoked provolone was very, very good.   Just did not make up for the main courses.     Arlechino's...I just don't get it.",

We started off with the salmon carpaccio, which was excellent. It was well dressed and flavorful. Then, we had the house salad. For the pasta, I had the cacio e pepe option, so they made my pasta table side in the huge parmigiano reggiano wheel. I believe this is the only place in Pittsburgh to offer this as I have only had this before in Australia.   Finally, for my meal I had the chilean sea bass with jumbo lump crab and my dad had the barramundi. The sea bass was one of the best cooked fish dishes I have ever had. It was so soft that it was almost buttery. The creamy grain mustard sauce and crab was a nice addition, but not even needed as the fish was so good.   Overall, one of the best meals I have had in Pittsburgh. Our waitress was outstanding. The personalized touches really made the dinner special. Finally, the food itself was perfectly cooked and delicious. A perfect restaurant for a special occasion.",

The service was great. We will now plan to visit this restaurant on a regular basis - if we can get a reservation!",

There were 10 of us and everyone seemed to enjoy their meal. I chose the Arctic Char which was delicious. I had this when I was in Iceland and it was freshly caught. I have to say I was very impressed with the flavor and presentation. We also had several appetizers. I wasn't a huge fan of the calamari because I expected it to be deep fried but definitely order the meatballs! Also the pasta with vodka sauce they serve prior to your meal was amazing!",

The bar is a focal point of this restaurant as it situates on a balcony overlooking the dining area. Hey the food was amazing and you get a 3 course meal for what the entrees cost. The staff is very knowledgeable and the kitchen is a scratch kitchen so stuff is fresh and made to order. The owners of Alla Famiglia (sp) also own this one so if you like thy restaurant you will definitely like this one. Highly recommend! Oh and they have complimentary valet service.",

Even the salad had unique ingredients and wonderful flavor. I had the lemon cake dessert and it was great. This is definitely a hidden gem. I'm so glad we heard about it!",
