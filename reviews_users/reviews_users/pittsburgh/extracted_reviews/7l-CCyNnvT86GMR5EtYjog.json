We sampled the artichoke and spinach dip as well as the grilled chicken on a stick, and both were super yummy. We ended with the salmon bowl and that was a great choice albeit spicy. A runny nose after dinner is a good thin, in our opinion. The wait staff are friendly, and we have no problem hearing each other and for dinner. My only one suggestion would be don't go here if you don't like dim lighting. We hope to head back when it's warmer so we can enjoy the patio.",

We had a couple really minor issues (like not liking a mixed drink) and our waiter (Noah) and the manager (Scott) were beyond helpful and amazing. They honestly  made the experience a memorable one. We had a great time and we'll be back soon. Nice happy hour specials. The red sangria was delicious... just get the pitcher. Trust me, you'll drink it.",

I was in town for work and popped in here for lunch. The rib tacos were amazing. It was a mix of things i didnt think would go together but wow did it ever.  I also grabbed the delmantaco a go go sandwich. Another amazing choice.  Their menu is hilarious and staff is friendly. I will be going here every time i visit Pittsburgh.",

It was an honest mistake on the kitchen's part. I sort of expected to be discounted the cost of my meal but the manager paid for our entire lunch.

I went with a small group, and ended up waiting for well over an HOUR to get served after we placed our order. The manager eventually realized we had been waiting forever and offered us a free round of drinks without us having to say anything, which was very nice, however, it still took a good 20-30 minutes after this to finally get our food. The icing on the cake was that out of our group of 5, my one friend and I waited over 20 minutes after everyone else had paid and received their cards back before we had to hunt down the manager and ask where our cards were. The manager then had to go find our server himself and investigate this before we FINALLY got our cards/receipts. We never got an explanation or an apology, and this caused us to miss one Uber, followed by having to apologize to another, very annoyed Uber driver who waited for us after we missed our first attempt.",

Had to go back a second time try their other dishes. First trip I had a cheeseburger with Mac n cheese as a side, husband had something with pirogies, cheese, all I remember is that it has basically had everything in it. (Said it had the best pirogies he's ever had). Son had the langoustine Mac n cheese (said it was the best he's ever had) We were all very happy with our meals and went back a second time. Had the braised short rib quesadilla, sooo much meat in it! Filled me up after only 3 pieces. Husband had the cheeseburger and actually said 'wow', he's never impressed with cheeseburgers as they tend to be average almost everywhere. Definitely recommend eating here if you want food that actually has flavor, is unique and not for the general masses. The food was so good that we bought a round for the kitchen each time we were there (for $9.99 you can add this to your tab and they'll give the cooks a round after work). Also, service was amazing both times!",

The food was pretty good and well portioned, and our waitress was really nice. But, when we got our checks we noticed that there were multiple errors and that all four of us had been overcharged. We pointed out the mistakes to our waitress who brought it up to her manager. He apologized and tried to fix the mistakes. But after getting the new checks, there were still errors on two of them. I pointed this out to the manager, who rudely replied that he \"didn't care about three dollars worth of chicken\" and would take it off the check, when it was very clearly not supposed to be on there to begin with. This whole ordeal took a while to figure out, and we expected to be compensated with at least better attitudes from the staff.",

    "text": "Shiloh Grill, one of the heart restaurants on Mount Washington, they have a patio and indoor seating for your desired heart and depending on weather. I personally have been there several times. Their menu is creative and very much annoyingly descriptive, but that is Shiloh Grill. Their hummus is chunky but damn good, turkey burger, is not your ordinary turkey burger, but its still a turkey burger. (DAMN GOOD). Pulled Pork, OMFG!!! This is the thing to order, their Gay Al's Barbecue Sauce needs to be marketed, for sale in a huge gigantic bottle for my household. And that saying that I have created my own recipe of BBQ Sauce, but i'd still buy theirs. Jamaican Tacos, or Jamaican my boyfriend crazy, that Jamaican Jerk rub they have is off the chains. They have a steak sandwich, that will hit your potbelly and make you feel all yummy inside.  But for this experience tonight, was something else. And doesn't deserve an A+ that they usually do.  I seem to have a problem with servers disappearing, not that they need to be up my you know what all dinner long, but a little reassurance that you want our paid bill and not for us to dip out would be nice. So they have new additions like a pork shank with polenta. that I really wanted to try. but it was under the \"appetizer\" section that I got a little nervous wondering how small were they for my \"entree\" meal. So we ordered pierogies, and they are awesome but my first bite was a bit** slap of salt with the onions. Getting through that was easy since they must of dumped all the salt on that poor spot. However later to discover was a hair, a small black curly hair? Turn your taste buds off yet? LOL we ate them anyways, they weren't touching any so whatever.I  ordered their bacon cheeseburger, which on Tuesdays they have Bacon Night. Hello to all my vegetarians that get a veggie burger loaded with bacon. Yeah I know a few! My boo-man ordered the short rib tacos, to then discover that they had no sauce and came with a salad. He was not planning on being healthy that night. And do NOT deserve to be priced at 15$. All in All we will return. it must have been an odd night for Shiloh on the mountain.",

The offering of craft beer on the menu were plentiful, but sadly the two my man wanted had kicked and there was no back up.  He found a third to try, but really wanted his first pick.  Guess the weekend got ahead of them, and when you are out, you are out.  I was happy they serve Kaliber non alcohol beer which is my favorite.  The menu isn't large but offers a interesting selections.  We ordered the cheese balls and WOW are they delicious.  This isn't your ordinary mozzarella cheese stick like balls.  The waiter said the cheese is made locally and had a soft, salty and tangy bite.  I enjoyed the pork tacos that were so good I would have them again.  My man had the hamburger advertised as one of the best in Pittsburgh - he agrees.",

This is my go to restaurant and bar. My 200th review as well.   Cheers was 90's TV show about a bar where everybody knew your name. The Shiloh grill is that bar on Mount Washington. Walk in the greeter knows you, the bartender knows you and so does the kitchen staff, bar back and waiter or waitress. The bar is small (half point deduction) and if you can find a seat you'll get meet some nice bartenders and barbacks who seem to not be able to do enough to make your visit perfect. The seemingly endless drink menu is loaded with unique drinks. I love the blueberry basil lemonade, lemon vodka, home made sours mix, then the bartender crushes fresh basil and blueberries into the glass and pours the vodka and sours over that. Great drink to enjoy on the patio which overlooks Shiloh Street. Great wine selection (Wednesday is Wine Wednesday, glasses of wine 6 Bucks all day) and a rather impressive selection of bottled and tapped micro brews. Being an IPA fan, I'm giddy with excitement when I walk in to see what new IPAs I can enjoy with their great food!   Which brings me to the menu! This is one entertaining menu, seriously you'll giggle at the way each menu item is described. The hummus is off the charts delicious. Creamy and chunky at the same time. Flavored perfectly and served with fresh veggies and warm pita. The Alexander the Greek salad is a lettuce free salad of quinoa, tomato, onion, cucumber, olives and feta cheese, it's a refreshing, light meal, also served with warm pita. The menu is loaded with pub and comfort foods like Mac and Cheese, burgers, steaks , sandwiches and pastas. For dessert you gotta try the homemade chocolate chip cookie baked and served in a cast iron skillet, served with vanilla bean ice cream! Yeah, I know, your mouth is watering.   I love this place if you can find a parking spot (this is where they lose another half star) because their lot is small. If you live on the Mount, walking to the Shiloh might be your best bet.",

The drinks and appetizer were great. I had Flo's Lemonade and Don had a fruity libation that was so tasty we could have had just drinks and nothing else. The cheese and meat plate went well with the drinks. We ordered the jerk chicken over rice and black beans with pineapple salsa on top. It was the best meal that we have had up there in a long time.

I was at the restaurant, upstairs, with about 13 people and it was a bad experience.  1. The food was not as nice as it was expected to be. It looked like something you could have made right at home. 2. There were gnats flying around everywhere 3. Several of our food orders got mixed up, and it took forever for us to get our food.  Now, I would understand if the place was packed, but we were the ONLY party at the restaurant at the time!  Sorry, Shiloh...I hope you improve and grow to your potential!",

We got there about 7 and it was a 20 min wait, which was perfect because we were able to enjoy a drink at the bar. The host texted us our wait time and came over to get us when the table was ready. Our waiter, Bobby was awesome! He was really friendly, made sure to let us know he could answer any questions about the menu and gave great recommendations. We shared the calamari which was perfectly cooked and served topped with a sweet and tangy sauce. I ordered the grilled fish tacos which came with quinoa and green beans. I wouldn't change a thing, perfectly cooked, great spice and good portion. My friends got the Mac and cheese, pulled pork sandwich and one of the veggie sandwiches and they both were happy. My only regret is we went on a Thursday and not a Tuesday which is apparently all you can eat bacon!!!",

Food isn't bad but the service always seems to be painfully slow. Took two hours for a typical meal (for 2 people) the last time we were there. Server, while a nice guy, took more than ten minutes to acknowledge our table & take drink orders after we were seated. The food took an exceptionally long time to come out after the appetizer- and all we ordered was two burgers. The server was nowhere in sight & did not check back until the food was almost gone. Meanwhile we were short one fork for a side dish and in need of napkins and drink refills. We sat forever once we were done, and the clearing of plates/ bringing the check took a solid 25 minutes. As someone who had several waitressing jobs in the past, I tend to be more patient and understanding when it comes to eating out. However, this was more of a late night dinner - not during a busy dinner rush- and the service was still poor/inefficient. Still worth checking out, just something to keep in mind if you have somewhere to be after!",

So far the food has been enjoyable (buffalo chicken dip?  yes, please) as well as the atmosphere.  Having gone to their sister restaurant in Shadyside, I was really happy to see the Shiloh open again.    My only complaint is one which will be ironed out in time: the wait staff is still trying to adjust.  For example, the waitress we had when we ate there took quite some time to come back to us to refill beers and waters.  It wasn't busy so I was a little upset about that.  When I went for drinks one night, they only had one bartender and a barback that was not old enough to back-up the bartender when they got busy.",

Our lives are entwined with it--from winning the contest to name their pig mascot--we chose Herbie Hamhock--to making it the reception location for our wedding. The staff is amazing--they feel like friends. The menu is witty and quirky. And the art mixes history (Katherine Soffel's story) with the humorous and the bizarre (Geurnica meets bacon). As for the food, we haven't found a clunker on the menu. The standouts are the hush piggies and the mac and cheese. The hush piggies are everything a good bar appetizer should be. They're deep fried balls of finely grated potato, cheese, and bacon. Dipped in a sriracha aioli, they are enough to make one believe in the existence of a higher power. The mac and cheese is, simply put, the best we've ever had anywhere. Paul likes to add bacon to the mac as a routine, but sometimes, when we're feeling flush, he indulges in the perfectly seasoned medium rare hanger steak. We've tried to get the recipe from numerous servers, but no one has coughed up the goods. Not to be missed, is the bacon cheeseburger, the short rib tacos, and the Pittsburgh salad. The range of alcoholic options is also impressive. K particularly enjoys the pumpkin sangria, when in season, and, when not, she'll happily imbibe the frozen Cosmo (which packs a punch).  Don't hesitate to give this place a shot. In fact, you'll probably see us there.",

Good menu and a great selection of all kinds of drinks.  Take some time and read the food and drink menus. I love it. A little snarky, a little humor, and great descriptions of each and every item.  We had a wide array of food at the table and everyone seemed content with their orders. I got the lobster mac and cheese and it was just what I needed. Creamy and tasty, topped with crispy and seasoned. Mmmmm.  I also had a drink. The \"Madison Square Garden\". I was a little disappointed in this at first because it says it has all kinds of sweet liqueurs- but tasted like a glass of straight bourbon. The sweetness was actually hiding under the ice ball and came thru at the end of the drink. As a bartender, I know this drink could have been made better- but overall it was tasty.  I'd like to go back in the summer and sit on the deck. It was COLD that night!",

Drinks were refilled promptly , dishes removed, and we were checked on multiple times.  When it came to the food, to me it was nothing really special. I had gotten the half-baked Italian sandwich with a side of mac n cheese. The sandiwch itself was not bad, the Tuscan aioli did give it some good flavor. However, when it came to the mac n cheese I can say I am glad I only got the side...it was just on the plain side, with very runny cheese and was just not for me (which I was pretty disappointed in). We had also got the Hush Piggies which were nice and crispy, but once again the taste was just not for me.",

The waitstaff was more than willing to help me get the information I needed to make my experience comfortable and delicious. I'll be returning to Shiloh grill in the future!

And there was an old-fashioned charm with the wooden staircase in the middle of the floor. It was half off frozen cosmopolitans, so why not?!? The frozen cosmo was delicious with a wonderful flavor. I also redeemed my free bowl of chili from the Yelp check-in. The chili was excellent, but beware: it has a spicy kick! Use the dollop of sour cream to tone it down. I also tried the Delmonico a Go Go steak sandwich, and it was the best! The steak was tender and flavorful. The bread was perfectly toasted with butter and aioli. I can't wait to come back here for a nice wind down dinner with friends. If this is the sister grill of Harris Grill in Shadyside, I'm inclined to try that as well!",

    "text": "I really enjoyed this experience. We were seated quickly with our reservation. Our initial reservation called for six adults, which was a nice round table. I love round tables, they give everyone an equal footing on which to discuss what they wish. So anyways, they were able to quickly transfer us to a longer rectangular table, when we switched to eight.  I got the pesto party dish? Is that even correct?? I added salmon though. It was awesome! The salmon was cooked perfectly, with a crispy exterior and fully cooked interior. The pesto wasn't strong at all (I actually love a overly strong pesto taste) and the peppers and such were great.  So my mother was with me on this visit, and she likes a bit of heat. She ended up ordering the Jamaican tacos. She gave me one, they were spicy, but awesome! I had to old a bit of something afterwards in my mouth to take the heat away, but they were great!   The kitchen was fast and everything was great, including the music selection that was played throughout. I did notice a dominant male staff, which made me think about whether or not the owner was female or not...  Anyways, I enjoyed my experience here and recommend a visit to see if you like it or not. I'm sure I'll return sooner or later.",

Our waitress had no manners, her response to a salad that needed to be returned because the spinach leaves were soggy and the dressing was oily with no taste was, \" why, what don't you like about it?\" After explanation she asked in a rude tone if we wanted to order another we said no she called her supervisors over and he was ok with taking the salad back. Prior to this her comments and remarks were very rude and uncalled for let alone her body language. Sadly due to the lack of customer service this place received 2 stars.  If you like buffalo wings cooked well done in which we do go there simply for that and the drinks!",

The bacon was crisp, the home fries were don't perfectly.  There were two choices of salads, fruit, an omelet station.  I wanted to go back for seconds but I was too full.  The brunch was very reasonably priced ($18.01 per person which includes a cocktail).  I never had a frozen mimosa before but I think that is my new favorite drink!   The service was also excellent.   The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the limited parking.  There are only about 8 spots in the small lot and the rest is street parking.  I will definitely go back.  Rodney, if you reserve a space in your parking lot one Sunday per month for me, I will give you 10 stars.",

Pun-laden menu offerings and rich, indulgent foods are the highlights at the Harris Grill's mountain-top cousin. Bacon Night is Tuesday, and there are Brady Bunch Brunch options on Saturday. My favorite menu item for the last 5 years is the Garden Weasel: Grilled Zucchini, Portabella cap, Roasted Red Peppers and more on a Brioche bun. Get Tots as a side, you won't regret it! Their seasonal drinks are marvelous. Also it must be said, the multiple hard lemonade options are delightful, if not a tad too sweet.  Conclusion: Try them out on your next trek up the mountain! Get patio seats if you can!",

They had a decent beer selection, but no beer specials for football Sunday. I was a bit disappointed because the beers were a bit on the pricey side.   As for the food, I ordered a medium cheese burger with bacon. It was cooked well and not burned. It came with steak fries that came out hot, but they were unfortunately not crispy. I also got the free bowl of chili. The chili was awesome! I definitely recommend taking advantage of the Yelp offer for a free bowl.

    "text": "Slacker Chic: It's old hat, dude.   That seems to be Shiloh Grill's theme with its \"ironic\" bill of fare copy and all too laid-back staff, complete with messy hair and stubble on the gents.   I bring this up because of the lackluster service, but more on that later.   Kay and I came by last night due to traffic troubles as well as curiosity; we wanted to see if Shiloh as in fact superior to nearby Redbeard's. Nuh-huh, man.   The menu features nothing innovative, and that in itself is no crime. If their standard steaks, tacos, wings, sandwiches, and burgers were high-caliber, that would be fine, but for the most part, what we had didn't quite stack up to the ceiling.   The pierogi, which in this case are deep-fried and homemade according to the menu, were more like Mrs. T's than Baba Grabowski's, know what I'm sayin'? The outside was crispy, buttery, onion-laden. The insides were starchy and cheesy. Adequate might be the word I'm searching for, and they were barely so. Again, I got a freezer-section vibe from these particular Polish dough packets. If they are handmade, someone's not trying, and I wouldn't be surprised if they aren't considering the...err...atmosphere? Culture? What am I trying to say? I'm working on that.  My Po Boy Crabcake sandwich is half the price of the crabcake entree, and comes in a bun that doesn't know whether it wants to be a Cibatta, baguette, or English Muffin, and there's nothing wrong with that sort of confusion at all. but sadly enough, it was the best and most interesting component of the sandwich.   The crabcake itself, to my palate, had a tell-tale aftertaste and uniformly cut crab chunks, indicating cryogenic shipments and quickie reheats. Was Swanson or Schwan's in on this hoax? \"Grandma Sheila's secret sauce\" was a tasteless remoulade that was as irrelevant as the Flowbee. If Grandma Sheila exists, and I doubt she does, she should email my mother for her remoulade and crabcake recipes.   The fries that came with it were dusted with an exotic blend of spices that failed to mask the fact that they were limp, far from crisp, and a complete flop. Unfortunately, they were served in a hefty portion.  A bite of Kay's Bacon Cheeseburger gave me some hope that SG has something going for it. Moist 'n rich, 'tis a pity that burgers aren't all SG sells.   Dessert was an overcooked debacle that took 20 minutes (???) to prepare. Cookies-n-Cream is their dismal take on the chocolate chip cookie sundae. Oh, how it sizzled, so much so that our Gen X'er waiter advised us not to touch the dish, which came on a plate. The bulk of the ice cream melted before our spoons touched a thing. There was canned whipped topping and Hershey's chocolate syrup involved, and in just a few minutes, we had a dairy soup on our hands. At this point, the cookie had been reduced to mealy crumbs.  Slacker Chic: It Bites Like Reality, Bro.   So we were seated outside as per our wishes. However, it was broiling outside sans any shade, the sun pitilessly baking me. I saw our server installing umbrellas into the iron tables and asked him for one. His response went something like this...  \"Uh, that was the last one. I think. There might be more in the basement. Uh, I dunno man, I can lend you my shades and baseball cap. Heh.\"   And he walked away shaking his head, chuckling at our obvious unease.   One would think he that would have at least offered us indoor seating, especially considering the ever swelling, ever obnoxious drunken party that crammed next to us without regard to our comfort or existence. More of them just kept coming and coming and coming, looking for more chairs, bumping into us, sticking their asses in our faces, littering our table with cigarette ash, polluting our ears with profanity, shrill laughter, and talk of feminine hygiene issues and bad sexual encounters. I gathered that they were all co-workers, and if so, I want to know who employs them so I don't ever apply for a job with that organization.   And if our experience wasn't already a hog's lunch, as we were leaving, a barmaid delivered a dripping wet mug of beer to one of the harpies seated next to us. As her hand left the mug, she inadvertently flung mead all over me. Very nice. I might as well have been at a Jimmy Buffet gig. The barmaid never looked my way either nor did she apologize.   The mediocre Redbeard's managed to Hoover even less than Shiloh Grill.   What an upset.",

One of those places was the Monongahela Incline, and boy did were drive around and around (lots of detour signs) before we got help from a friendly couple who had us follow them to a parking lot near the Incline. Got to the top of the Incline to Mt. Washington - beautiful view! It was an unseasonably warm October Sunday, and after walking to the different lookouts, we were hot and thirsty. There was only one place open at 3:00pm - Shiloh's! I was soooooo thirsty! I asked if I could order an iced tea in a to-go cup. The only thing they had was a kiddie cup, but, hey! I'm not picky! After they got it for me, they refused to take any payment! If we didn't have dinner reservations with friends later, we would have certainly dined here!",

    "text": "Let me say that this is a review only for Sunday brunch buffet.  A and I show up at like 10:30 and decide to sit outside which is beautiful.  Nice deck overlooking the street.  We had Jared as a waiter.  If this review were just about how awesome Jared was, it would get like 10 billion stars.  We often go out for breakfast and generally spend several hours gabbing.  Most waiters don't know what to do with us.  Either they ignore us or hover making it known that we need to move it along.  Jared did neither of those things - he refilled out coffee and waters a billion times.  He asked if we wanted anything and when we said that we were going to take out time, he had no problem.  When we finally did get up to go upstairs for the buffet, we took our purses cause 1. who doesn't take their purse when they have to walk from outside to inside and up stairs and no one will be sitting at their table anymore and 2. it's Mt Washington.  The busboy came and cleared out entire table!  Jared quickly got us new waters, new coffees, new silverware, creamers, sugars, salt and pepper, etc.    The food, however, is where this place was lacking.  If you have a buffet at a busy restaurant on Sunday morning, there are a few things that you need to get right: 1.  HAVE FOOD.  Over half the containers were completely empty!  And when the people would come re-fill, they seemed to only re-fill the ones that already had food in them.  2.  Have mac n cheese.  If you are known for your mac n cheese, which Shiloh is, you should actually have pans and pans pre-made and ready for re-fills.  3.  Have the food HOT.  How on earth was everything flying out of there so fast that most of the stuff was empty, but also nothing was hot - some of it was barely lukewarm.    There were some highlights - the pulled jerk pork was amazing.  No idea what you were supposed to do with it alone, but it was really good.  The stuffed peppers, also an odd choice, were very tasty.  The best in my opinion was the carmelized onion and gruyere quiche.  It was very onion-y, but sadly barely warm at all.",

The menu is vast and entertaining, and everything we ordered was great -- especially the mac & cheese with lobster and the short rib tacos. Good tap list & seasonal cocktails and reasonable prices.  This was a great dinner destination after riding the incline and sightseeing on Mt. Washington. We will be back next time we're in Pittsburgh!",

I had a friend in from out of town for his first visit to Pittsburgh, so naturally, you are going to take that person to Mt. Washington for the view.  While there, we stopped to grab dinner.  The outside deck is large and accomodating.  The beer and drink selection was very nice.  The place was very busy but the service was good and we always had water/drinks.    Mac and Cheese is all you need to know to get from here.  Add some chicken, grilled or blackened, or steak and it is even more amazing.  I would definitely come back to check out some other items...or just have more mac and cheese.",

Then we were going to sit on the patio and the twit hostess said we have your table ready and it was a table for only 4 we had 5. So we left and went to red beards. What a totally different atmosphere. We were greeted in a friendly manner and treated with respect the whole night. Sorry but I will never be back at the Shiloh grill!

Favorite part of this place was the cool things on their doors to open them so you don't have to touch the handles!! Server was super fun and we spent a lot of time there but i found their cocktails to be cheap and too fake tasting. And not a great wine list.

If not, this place is definitely worth a try. I went last night and tried the lobster Mac and Cheese  and the Turkey Burgher. Both were great very rich, with big portions. The rosemary aioli on the sandwich wasn't my cup of tea, but overall the flavor was good. I would probably have preferred that the mac and cheese was baked and crispy, but we certainly didn't leave anything left on the plate :)  The atmosphere seemed comfortable - It felt like it could be my neighborhood bar if I lived closer. We were sat right by the front door, which was a bummer, but I'm curious to see what the upstairs seating is like. I'd definitely go back.  Best tip: get your sandwich with a side of tater tots. Crispy and fun!",

    "text": "My last review is, to this day, still the worst review I have given for the worst service I have ever received. Shiloh Grill has proved a disappointment yet again and this review still stands True. Now that we live on Mount Washington (we moved about 5 months ago) I have been avoiding it due to our previous visit. Today our friend suggested it so 4 of us went out together. It wasn't busy, many open tables but we sat outside which also had many open tables. After getting our water, our waiter said he'd be back to take our orders. I ordered first and asked for the calamari. He said they were out. I actually began to laugh thinking it was a joke due to our last visit. Before anyone spoke he said, \"we just had a table of 80 and they cleared us out on food.\" Please tell me why you wouldn't tell us this right when we sat down, not nearly 20 minutes later? My boyfriend then said, \"what do you have? I was going to get the weasel (or something titled that, I just know it was a portobello sandwich), do you have that?\" Our wait told us they did not have that and really were \"out of everything\". This was the second time I gave Shiloh Grill a chance and I WILL NEVER GO BACK. Why is your kitchen open if you have no food? I understand large parties. But a party of 80? You weren't prepared? Even so, you should have food for 80 people in a night. I have worked years in the restaurant business so I understand issues beyond control but to not tell us when you gave us a menu? Maybe the owners of Shiloh Grill should worry more about customer service and actually being a worthy restaurant than all of their unoriginal and frankly worthless puns that fall extremely short just like their service and their food. I truly think this is a joke. At least they're consistent.  P.S. No manager came out to apologize and we left with nothing but waters on the table.",

It was very close to the station.   The service was very friendly and attentive. We had a very tired/squirmy toddler and a very hungry baby in tow. They were so accommodating! My husband ordered and loved his bacon cheeseburger. I ordered the Totchos and added braised rib meat. It was the best thing I ate all week! The cheese, chili, and meat were generously heaped on hot crispy tots. I also ordered a bomb pop frozen drink that was very strong!   If you're in the area of Mt. Washington or Station Square, stop here! You won't regret it!",

The menu looked simple yet a refreshing change from your typical pub I am used to (I live in AZ).  It was a great night so I asked for a table on the deck and I ordered a Belgian beer. While I relaxed and enjoyed the weather I looked at plates that were being served at other tables to aid the decision making process. The staff was very friendly and not pushy at all.  I started with the Polish Church Basement Pierogies  because, you know, \"While in Rome...\" I am not an expert on Polish food but they were some of the best I've had. The pasta was soft and buttery and the potato filling, well seasoned.  For an entre I enjoyed the \"Eggplant Aubergine\". This \"healthy-ish\" dish will take your tastebuds on a slow and sensual sail on an ocean of flavors. Picture a lasagna made with thinly-sliced fried eggplant instead of noodles, held together by cheese and sauce and topped with... MORE CHEESE! A magnificent dish that will leave you wanting more.

Yes they have brunch from 11:30-2 on Saturdays.  There is a check in freebie of a bowl of chili which I gave to my son. It was very hot and spicy but he loved it. We all decided to forgo the brunch and try build a bowl instead. This is where you will start with a starch listed, add a protein such as chicken, steak, or portobello mushrooms to name a few and then top it off with whatever you want. I opted for the quinoa, topped it with both grilled chicken and portobello mushrooms and took roasted vegetables for my topping. It was indeed very good! My son had a different type of bowl and he thoroughly enjoyed it. My daughter settled for a burger with fries. We liked how they imprinted the bun with their trademark.  They are known for the mac and cheese but none of us could eat that much so we decided to forgo it. The Grill has it's own small lot to park in and is located in Mt. Washington very close to the Grandview bakery.  They have a separate bar area as well and a comprehensive menu.Outdoor seating is available as well. Will definitely return on a future visit.",

In my defense, I've been to their sister restaurant, the Harris Grill, over 1,000,000 times so I should be easy on myself.  I came for brunch and was pleasantly surprised with the numerous selections both in the breakfast and lunch families.  On location and ready to rock was an omelet chef doing made to order omelets.  You could also choose from Egg's Benedict,  quiche, waffles, bagels and salmon, cheese, fruit, salad, mac and cheese.....yeah, need I go on?    Order brunch with a Bloody Mary and you're in the neighborhood of $20.  Yes, for all that.  So worth it and so very good.  Our waitress was great and stopped by many times to check on us.  The food was plentiful and everything was continuously refilled and kept nice and hot.    There is a very small parking lot on sight but chances are you're going to have to drive around a bit and find street parking.  It is what it is but it IS WORTH IT!",

Washington, it has what many consider, the \"best view in America\". Absolutely gorgeous views of Pittsburgh! Shiloh Grill is closest to the Mon Incline and it's very easy to access by car too. Parking is easy to find in the lot by the Incline, and Shiloh Grill has a small parking lot as well.  We came on our first night in Pittsburgh and loved the eclectic menu, very cool atmosphere and the friendly service. I had the fish tacos which were incredibly good. Perfectly balanced with some kick, paired with a delicious quinoa salad, and roasted veggies that were to die for! My daughter had the Britney Spears chicken which she loved, and my son enjoyed his burger. The hubby opted for Pierogies and wings, and everything was delicious!  Next day we were still talking about Shiloh Grill and decided to head back for more. This time my Husband had the fish tacos, which he called the best tacos he'd ever had, and I had the Jamaican tacos which were fantastic! The kids had a pita pizza and the Delmonico steak sandwich. They both loved it!!  Both nights food was fantastic, service was great, and we left wanting more. This is a place we will come back to any time we are in Pittsburgh. Lots of great menu items and consistently great food",

Sadly we learned upon arrival that frozen mimosas are only on Sunday's. They had frozen cosmos and it was too beautiful of a day to really let this ruin our brunch.  We both ordered the breakfast Mac n cheese which sounded oddly gross and delicious at the same time. It was excellent. My only real complaint is that the waitress asked each of us what we wanted as our side. We later asked why we were each charged $4-5 for our side and she said sides don't come with the meal. She should probably work on the way she's phrasing that question because I never would have ordered a side I just assumed, based on the way she phrased it, that it came with a side.",

I wanted to be brave and try the seasonal pumpkin sangria but decided on a pumpkin beer and they had a fantastic selection of about 5 or 6 different kinds on tap. The menu is about the same as Harris Grill. I do wish they had a few more options. This time I went with the pulled pork with red potatoes and coleslaw.  Everything was just ok. I do enjoy how they let you pick a side if you don't want the French fries.  The coleslaw was super spicy which I was not expecting.  Our waitress was very friendly and was very willing to split our checks even for the large party. 18% gratuity was added however the waitress made sure we knew this ahead of time. I recommend going when the weather is nice to sit outside on their deck.",

We ordered wings and our server never brought extra napkins until we complained. He also never refilled our drinks, nor could we find him to ask him to. I'm debating on returning. The atmosphere was loud and reminiscent of a college bar on Carson St. It's a shame because the food was good, but it just goes to show you that bad service can ruin a perfectly good meal.",

    "text": "I had no idea that this was a sister restaurant to Harris Grill until I stepped inside. It is a refreshing change from the rest of Mount Washington, in that you know you will be treated well no matter what you are wearing. While I definitely enjoy a nice meal and am willing to pay the price for it, I feel like many (but not all) of the places on Mount Washington charge for the view, rather than the food. Shiloh is a relatively inexpensive option, with very friendly staff and a great drink menu. The venue is also nice, and if you do want to see that view that people pay money for at other restaurants, I recommend walking along Grandview. The view is better on foot than from any restaurant anyways!",

Came here on recommendation of a couple people who worked at the Sheraton Station where my dad and I were staying.    Everyone we talked to at the hotel about this place recommended the Delmonico steak sandwich.  They all said basically the same thing.  \"It's what a Philly cheese steak  aspires to be\".   I'm not sure if this is just a Pittsburgh v Philly rivalry thing.  None the less, it was a good sandwich.  I also had the Gazpacho soup.  That was just what the doctor ordered.    We sat out on the patio on a warm sunny evening and enjoyed a beer and sandwich.    As with every place I went in Pittsburgh, the people were awesome.",

The atmosphere of Shilohs is very great, it is a comfortable place for anyone to go to, they have vegetarian meals and a large option of food, the menu is absolutely hilarious, as are the servers, my waitor was hysterical and this was the best waiting service I have ever received at any restaurant, Shilohs is very clean and has both upstairs and downstairs seating, a very nice bar, and very polite staff, also if you love bacon, you'll love Shilohs, also if you'd like to eat outside there is a beautiful deck to sit on. While you wait to beat seated you can walk about 100 ft down the street to an Outlook that overlooks the entire city of Pittsburgh up on Mt. Washington, you may also take a cable car down to the city, overall just an awesome experience and I would very much recommend it to anyone visiting Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "A party of five of us went to Shiloh grill Friday night for drinks and dinner. I had called ahead about reservations and was told they could give me a table inside but not necessarily out on the patio. However, when we arrived and asked for the patio, we were easily accomodated. It was a beautiful night to be able to sit outside and watch the people walking around Mt. Washington.  I love being able to carelessly relax on their deck on a nice night.  For dinner I ordered the quickie salad chop chop but requested steat be substituted for chicken. Although the menu states that the salad comes with balsalmic vinagarette, it`s actually dressed with their fig vinagarette which is much sweeter than a typical balsamic vinagerette in my opinion. The salad comes stacked with vegetables. Many more than are actually listed on the menu including chick peas and what I believe was hicama. The steak was done well and flavorful. However, I was extremely disappointed when I tried to order the fresh made chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream for dessert and they were out. In fact they were out of their chocolate cupcake and all choclate desserts! How do they run out of all of their chocloate desserts? Are they really that unprepared? It was busy but not ridiculously so. Even if the waitress would have told us this prior to the meal, I could have walked across the street to the cute ice cream shop before it closed. Being 8 1/2 months pregnant, I was severely craving a chocolatey end to my meal.  So, not a bad place to relax on a warm summer night but, don't expect to actually be able to order what`s on the menu.",

As far as the menu and atmosphere, it's all very similar to it's Shadyside brother. However, I quite prefer Shiloh due to it being much more relaxed. Harris is loud and tends to be a little crazy, Shiloh was the opposite. Maybe it's because we visited on a Sunday night, but it was very chill and there were only a few other tables and patrons at the bar.   I ordered the Jamaican tacos and was satisfied. They had a nice zing to them and the fruit helped neutralize how spicy it was. It also came with grilled veggies and a rice-like substance (can't remember the name of it!). It was $16, but totally worth the price. I ended up taking half of it home. Huge portions! We also ordered an appetizer of Buffalo Chicken dip with pita bread and veggies. It was good, but very much like the kind you could eat at a party. Though, the warm pita bread was a nice touch.   Their drink menu is huge (almost too big, making it hard to decide), but I decided on a Hot Spiced Cider. I thought it was very strong, yet still yummy. I don't think I would order it again, but it was definitely worth the try.",

    "text": "The first thing struck me about Shiloh Grill was the menu. Not the options or the size of the menu but the names. They were creative thought out and made me chuckle. If you're on a first date, they would be great ice breaker or way to break the silence.  Service at Shiloh Grill was above average as well. You can tell they care about your dining experience. A great example was one of the servers holding the door open for my friend with a torn ACL when we were leaving. They had our money and could have cared less but went the extra mile which would make me come back.  You can get in & out of Shiloh Grill quickly if you want. Our food & drink orders were promptly taken and brought out to us. There weren't long waits and the restaurant was moderately full.  The food at Shiloh Grill is very good. It's not the greatest food I have ever had, but I would not hesitate to come back. The presentation could use some work. It was a clean plate but I'd like to see it more artfully presented. I would like to see a larger beer list. There was really only one beer to represent each style of brewing you could get.  The chili is spicy, maybe to point of lacking a lot of flavor, but thats what I crave. Too top it off, it was free when checking in. Score! Next time, I'd like to try the calamari as it sounded amazing. The fish tacos were slightly above average. It's nowhere as good as something you'd get in San Diego, but pretty damn good for Pittsburgh.   The Cookies & Cream desert was not original. I actually had the same this in Jackson Hole this past week, but I loved the way it was described. I also like the whipped cream added and little bit of chocolate drizzle. That was a good touch!  All in all, I would recommend Shiloh Grill to someone looking for a quick but solid meal on Mount Washington. It is the best dining experience I've had on Shiloh Street.",

The food was unique in a good way, from the starters to the main dishes.  The cheese and cracker plate  was a great way to start our meal, a little kick of heat in the cheeseball was just right with the IPA's we picked.  My wife enjoyed the Chop Chop salad to the point of almost licking the bottom of plate, and the cheeseburger chimichanga I ordered spoiled me from ordering a cheeseburger any other way from now on.  The staff was great and our server's knowledge of beer was outstanding and very helpful in our choices of  what to drink.  Prices were more than fair for the portion size, next time we're in Pgh this will be our first stop for a bite to eat.",

The portions are generous and they aren't shy with the crab and lobster chunks. It's enough for 2 to share, one of of the best dishes I have ever had, EVER.  It's a very short walk to a beautiful area overlooking the city, I imagine it would be amazing at sunset! The grapefruit beer (Stiegl Radler Grapefruit) is phenomenal, and it's only %2.5! If in Pittsburgh this place is an absolute must. I live in San Antonio, TX and I'm already contemplating making another trip to Pittsburgh in the near future just for the Lobster and Crab Mac n Cheese! I'm so not kidding! This place was literally the highlight of our trip!",

We ordered the chippendip (tasted just like any other chips and dip from the store), the cauli-wings with chimichurri (so so good, surprised us a lot how much we loved them), and baskets of bacon since it was bacon night. I personally built my own bowl with quinoa, short rib, roasted veg, an egg, and the pineapple salsa which I did like, but it was lacking something like a sauce of some sort to bring it all together. Everyone thought their food was good, but no one raved about it. The server was super friendly, the busboys were attentive, but they asked to take away our chippendip about 7 times (apparently they didn't want us to finish it haha) which was a little over the top.",

I recommend it if a view while eating isn't essential. You can dine with a view at the other restaurants that are on the other side of Grandview.   What is nice here is food pricing is less expensive, food is consistent and they have a full bar. Good selection of brews on tap, wnd they have cocktail specials.   Outdoor seating adds to how many tables they have and helps one get seated faster.   An older guy that waited on us a couple times was a bit of a grouch, perhaps having a bad day. The other servers/employees were pleasant.   Also they have a nice menu for kids.   I'll definitely go back.",

Neither of us are drinkers so I got a soda, I wish they had given the option of a cheaper buffet without alcohol.  The food was alright - typical selection of breakfast standards (eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, bagels, etc.). They also had a meat carving station with lamb and prime rib.  Everything I had was either lukewarm or cold. The sausage gravy was much too salty. The prime rib was undercooked. The roasted vegetable fritatta was pretty bland. Eggs Benedict was soggy. The home fries were soaked in oil with a waxy texture. The fruit salad was 90% honeydew.  The apple pie was really good, don't know if it was made in house or not. There was also just a single cupcake in the middle of a sea of muffins. Odd?  Wait staff was nice and fairly attentive. Just seemed like the food was thrown together from whatever they had but maybe we just came too late in the day (brunch buffet goes to 3). We wouldn't have gotten the buffet but that's all they were offering. I guess for $24 plus tip I expect quality of food, not just quantity.",

It was pretty good, and surprisingly fulfilling. Don't get it if you don't like the crunchiness of zucchini though. Both my colleagues who got the crab cakes had good things to say about them.   The last thing I absolutely loved was when Rich (not sure of his role, I'm thinking manager) came up to our table, apologized for the wait with the food and gave one of my friends 2 DOLLARS to play music at the electrical jukebox! How's that for customer service??",

I asked for ketchup with my burger (I guess they don't assume you want it with a burger??) and had to wait another 5 minutes at least while the waitress stopped at like 3 other tables on the way. I almost walked over to the kitchen and got it myself.   My friend got what was honestly one of the worst salads I've ever tasted. Grilled veggie salad... it had one Brussels sprout and one tiny broccoli floret, a whole bunch of cooked carrot slices. There was something wrong with the dressing I swear, It was bitter. I Honestly I don't know how she ate it. The Manager came out and was very apologetic when I told him the truth. They took it off the tab so that was nice. But my burger was also mediocre at best and my potatoes had dirt in them. You known how it feels in your mouth when you chomp down on actual dirt?  Yeah.",

At first I was a bit concerned that the service might be slow as there was only one man waiting on all tables.  But let me tell you someone needs to give this man a raise. Not only was he attentive but he got all of our orders correct(including my complicated gluten freeness).  I got the turkey lurkey on a gluten free bun and let me tell you these are some of the best gluten free buns I've had in a while. Which is saying a lot. My family enjoyed their meals immensely and loved the atmosphere are the joint.  I highly recommend!",

    "text": "Awesome place to check out after taking the incline and checking out the view! Got here on a weekday a little after happy hour and was promptly seated outside.   Our waitress was super friendly and attentive and had us ordering more drinks and food then we should have but it was worth it!   The menu seems overwhelming at first as it looks like there are huge descriptions of each item that may or may not inform of what the dish really consists of! My bf and I ended up sharing a couple of appetizers (sriracha deviled eggs and sliders) and ordered the mac and cheese with jerk chicken to share. Everything was delicious but the mac and cheese was amazing! Soo good! Really i think the mac and cheese here with anything will be amazing!  We also started off with a couple of beers then we ordered a couple of rounds of the frozen cosmo. The frozen cosmos are super strong and delish. The fact that they are frozen makes it so refreshing on a hot summer day/night. Add a $1 and you can add more alcohol to it so be careful with these drinks! They might hit you hard if you have too many!  To finish things off we were convinced to get a hot cookie in a small cast iron pan loaded with ice cream! The cookie was ooey gooey and delicious.  I had an awesome night here and would love to come back for more delicious food and drinks!",

    "text": "I've heard lots of good things about this brunch. I found it to be a mixed bag. Solid basics (bacon, sausage) and an OK but not that imaginative omelette bar. On the hearty side, the chicken tikka was the highlight -- but again, solid but not that memorable. Salad, fruit and breads really limited. Breads and pastries looked pedestrian (Costco bought?) at best. Overall, this is a notch above three star hotel breakfast -- but far short of a first-class brunch. From selection to presentation, the brunch lacks imagination. My sense was that people came for the booze first, and the brunch was a nice add-on.   Service -- like nearly all service in Pittsburgh -- was just plain bad. Not rude, but definitely not informed or helpful. The table next to us had some extra needs or questions and the staff took on that distinctly Pittsburgh attitude of \"we're not here to be bothered.\" Even owner or manager who walked around never broke a smile or offered a thank you.  When I go to Austin or Miami or even a small town in Ohio, I find restaurant staffs -- and I eat cheap -- genuinely warm, pleasant, helpful. Pittsburgh just doesn't get service....at any price level.",

We tried perogies and 2 kinds of chicken wings for apps: delish, all!  Everyone enjoyed dinner as well, but the deserts were even better. The cookies and ice cream was warm and gooey and LOL the comfort food you'd want. The cheesecake was good, but not as outstanding as the C&C. They may be famous for Mac n Cheese, but I thought it was only \"good\", not to die for. The server was patient while we caught up with our friends, and so prompt once we made up our minds. Loved the free parking, and the view from the nearby overlook. I would definitely recommend Shiloh Grill for good food and good drinks  in a friendly atmosphere!",

    "text": "Hands down, top 5 of my favorite Restaurants in existence. Every inch of this place is done right from the food to the bar to the decor to the staff to the little hidden gems you find along the way (such as the relentless branding of \"Tuesday is Bacon night\" that appears on everything from the silverware bands to the faux Guernica painting in the dining room). I used to use the Shiloh exclusively as my \"Firs Date Spot\" because the dimly lit ambiance sets a really nice mood for a personal conversation, and if the conversation ever ends than you can simply spend the next hour reading the food or drink menu and laughing about all the awesome/ witty captions that go along with each item. Now adays I stop in anytime I get the chance. They rotate some really awesome craft brews and they change up their drink menu seasonally. The spinach dip is a great starter and my personal favorite item on the menu is the Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese. But, the thing that has always impressed me most about The Shiloh is the Staff. Every question I have ever asked any Bartender, Server or Hostess about any food or drink has been answered with a solid response, showing total mastery of the menu and a real knowledge and love for what they are selling.  If you have never been to the Shiloh, go there now.",

Oh, and who can forget bacon night (although I wish the bar area was bigger as the seats get taken fast!).    They have an extensive drink menu and their menu has something for everyone in my opinion.  Some of it is done much better than others though.  The service here has been consistent for the most part so I cannot complain there.    I love the outdoor deck area when the weather is cooperating with us too.

So I arrived just prior to the Dinner Crowd and was seated quickly - I asked for a house salad with cheese (Cheddar) but it came without - I choose the homemade Bleu Cheese which taste to me like a commercial dressing with added extra Bleu Cheese, it was too think for the amount that was given for this size of salad - I ordered wings and it was suppose to be a garlic base sauce that should give a lot of flavor! I asked for both Ranch and Bleu Cheese for the wings and like the Bleu Cheese with the salad it was too thick to really enjoy with the wings, The Ranch which was fair didn't really excite me but it wasn't bad and better than any commercial brand. The Establishment inside was very nice and the staff was also but the food wasn't unique - Maybe Wings isn't their Thing and to be fair I need to revisit for a burger.",

I understand it was a Saturday night but with literally no one waiting (we were the only two in the entry way) why was the wait so long? We left without even putting our names down. I wish I was able to try the food as other sites seem to gush about it, but I couldn't understand why there was such a wait. As I type this Yelp says there is no wait (lol)",

It was Happy Hour so I looked over their ample drink selections, including a variety of mixed drinks, wines and  their 16 beers on tap. Wanting to stay local, I ordered an East End Cherry Chocolate Stout from one of the friendliest bartenders (Gene) I've met in awhile. He asked me my name and used it throughout the evening, which I thought was a personable gesture. Plus, he was periodically joking with some of the locals, keeping it light and fun for a weeknight.   I struggled over what to order because there were so many selections that sounded wonderful, including their famous and plentiful Mac n Cheese, which two girls were sharing beside me. They didn't finish it. (I found out why later.)  I eventually decided on \"Thanksgiving on a Blawnox,\" a half-pound turkey burger with sage stuffing and a little rosemary aioli. When looking at the side dish options, the Mac N Cheese called out again, so I went with it. Great choice!  The turkey burger was very filling, but the MnC knocked it out da park with spiral pasta covered in delicious cheese almost as thick as paste. I now understand why some people just order this for their meal, even if it registers total calories in the five digits. Seriously, proceed with caution!",

    "text": "I recently met some friends on a Sunday for brunch and Shiloh Grill was our destination.  We didn't get there until after noon but the place was surprisingly empty.  None of us had been there before so we weren't sure what to expect.  I was not ready for my mind to be blown.  Their $14 brunch includes both an alcoholic and a non-alcoholic beverage and unlimited access to an out of this world brunch spread that gets it's own room.  Sure, there were an omlette bar and your expected bagels...but smoked salmon?  Yes.  Biscuits and gravy?  Yes.  The most bacon and sausage I've seen in one place?  Yes.  Okay, fine, maybe all that doesn't impress you.  But a buffet that offers Eggs Benedict?  Seriously?  And a maple bacon cupcake for dessert?  This can't be real.    Oh, but believe me friends, it is.  IT IS.  And if you don't believe me, I encourage you to try it for yourself.  You can't be disappointed.",

I LOVE this place and would not miss going here anytime I am in town.  I am a sucker for a good drink and their specials are amazing.  Last time I was here I had the pumpkin sangria.. Amazing.

All you can eat brunch buffet, with an omelette bar, some lunch options such as mac-n-cheese, and an included drink: definitely worth it. I tried their frozen mimosa, which I had never had before, and loved it. Now I'm wondering why all the other brunch places I have ever gone to hasn't made frozen mimosas! If you are in town for brunch, definitely give this place a try! You won't need to eat for the rest of the day!",

I usually tip high when I eat at a bar cause it's extra work for b-tender. These two (one named Keller only cause I asked trying to show him we were friendly and fun) are detrimental to your business. This first time customer will not be back. Shame",

Excited to try the calamari that I had been reading about online so we ordered it. OUT -  so no calamari for us. It was honestly the only appetizer that looked good to us so we didn't pick a replacement. Food took longer then expected to come out considering the crowd has diminished. This would have been excusable had the food actually come out hot. Mine was cold to the touch. I got the jerk chicken tacos and my partner in crime got the burger with their \"famous\" mac n cheese as it it advertised in the menu. That mac n cheese was laughable. It was runny and bland. The burger was your standard bacon cheese burger, no more/no less. The tacos were ok. They were advertised with pineapple on them, but I think I might have gotten one sliver in one taco. Pretty dry and not great. They came with roasted? veggies (HOLY SALT) that tasted like they were swirled around in a grease trap and then put on my plate next to a sad pile of quinoa that contained red onions and corn (doesn't sound great right? that's because it wasn't). The service wasn't very redeeming where the food was lacking. We never received refills until the check was being paid. It's not cool to go without a beverage when you're suffering though a salty meal. I was really looking forward to trying this place out and left so very disappointed.",

I was a little disappointed that the menu was almost exactly the same as the Harris Grill, but soon got over it as my generous serving of house sangria was delivered.  I started with a HG favorite bean soup served with crumbled bacon (this is a bisque and is very, very good).  Never have I ordered anything with complete caloric abandon, but was feeling needy and placed an order for Mac & Cheese with Lobster and Crab.  It was pretty fantastic.  Like... crazy end-of-days, make-your-jeans-hate-you fantastic.  I could not even eat half of it - because I knew I wanted the skillet chocolate chip cookie with ice cream.  Um, yes.  I ate it all.    My friend started with the tomato soup and was surprised by the nicely spiced serving (I will definitely try it next time).  She then had the crab cakes, which she also liked very much.    She agreed that the fresh cookie and ice cream was fab and we left feeling full and comforted.  Love their upstairs fireplace!  The service was definitely attentive and on top of everything, even though they were pretty busy.  Wouldn't hesitate to stop again.",

    "text": "We had tasty appetizers - Polish Church Basement Pierogies, Britney Spears (chicken) and Sriracha Deviled Eggs.  The chipotle sauce and a basil pesto were very tasty on the Britney Spears; the chicken was moist and flavorful.  I adore Sriracha and have consumed the sauce en masse since childhood, therefore iIt is likely that I am used to super spicy food and found the Sriracha Deviled Eggs tasty but not *spicy.*  A wonderful surprise was the Polish Church Basement Pierogies - our 3yo daughter loved them as much as we did!  Perfect taste and perfect consistency.  The Polish Church Basement Pierogies pairs very well with Flying Dog Gonzo Imperial Porter.  If a porter isn't in your taste profile, there is a large selection of beer and drinks where anyone can find something great.  I love that Flying Dog Gonzo Imperial Porter is available; this is one of the first porters I learned about, I adore dark beers and I appreciate the connection to Hunter S. Thompson!  That aside, the food:  YES!  The food was scrumptious.  The kids had hamburgers that were actually cooked to medium and not cauterized.  I opted for a vegetarian selection: The Garden Weasel.  This sandwich is a grilled zucchini and a portobello cap paired with roasted red peppers, tomatoes, onion, fresh mozzarella cheese, and basil pesto mayonnaise.  (I held off on the cheese.)  What a fabulous array of flavors!  I would love to go back and try their Jamaican chicken (which will be interesting since I've been a month in Jamaica) and their crab cakes (the ultimate test: my east coast palate).  If any place is up for a test, this one is!  I look forward to making this a usual stop whenever we're in the Mt. Washington area.    Lastly, our table opted in for the basket of bacon.  OMG!  Bacon is a religion at this place, and my kids are pious followers of all things swine.  (As if we weren't already sold!)  It is also fun to read the touristy \"haunted restaurant\" history of the Shiloh Grill.  Fun factoids and very Americana.",

Short rib tacos had no flavor other than spice. Grilled veggies tasted cold and 4 hours ago. The flour tortillas tasted like they were sitting out for a few. One of the people we sat with got a bowl in which 1/2 of what he wanted wasn't in it. Finally the other diner i was with got Mac and cheese which she liked, most likely from starvation, but never got her soup that she ordered.

Received a plain flavorless burger that was rare however still dry without the bacon on a dry yet somehow tough bun, with very poor tiny order of fries. Also ordered grilled fish tacos which were supposed to come with Cole slaw, veggies of the day and a salad. Received a very fishy, way overly spicy taco, quinoa which tasted disgusting, the veggies of the day. Where was the Cole slaw or salad? Called as soon as we got home and got horrible attitude.   My response to Rodney s.  Perhaps you should actually respect customers. I have read reviews of your establishment and your responses are not only childish they are also disrespectful and unprofessional. Perhaps instead of responding two times in a snarky way you should make sure that you're food quality is top notch. Also maybe you shouldn't suggest serving undercooked pork. Listeria is no laughing matter, and maybe you would know this if you actually cared about the product that your establishment serves instead of belittling customers who have had a sub par experience at your restaurant. Thank you for welcoming me to Yelp! Your establishment inspired me to join to let other hard working people to not waste not only their money but also their time at your establishment. I have actually eaten here on multiple occasions in the past but after your response I will not be back and I will encourage others to do the same. Your employees even had a phone number to contact me at and neglected too. So bravo to you.",

So we decided to dine out side.   Service was good! No complaints! Our waiter was friendly attentive and very accommodating. He explained the menu and gave us recommendations.  Food was good! The buffalo cauliflower was delicious! Also had the crab cake burger! Delicious crab cakes probably wouldn't have them in a burger again. My friend tried the lobster macaroni and cheese. Large portion! A bit too salty, but large chunks of lobster!   Overall good experience! Four stars because the inside was weird and smelly! But would come back and dine outside!",

Shiloh grill was perfect! The wise variety of menu items made it easy for everyone to find something to their liking. We made the 1 mile + walk from the Duquesne Incline to the Mt. Washington neighborhood in hopes of finding a spot that was more \"local\" and less touristy.  Everyone in my group was happy with their choices which ranged from a bacon cheeseburger to a zucchini pasta with salmon and a build-a-bowl.   While we missed happy hour, we were there for winey Wednesday and we're able to enjoy the $6 house wine glasses which were very generous pours. Staff was friendly and helpful, answering many of our questions and making menu suggestions. Would not hesitate to return.",

They had no issue seating us, though the place was busy and getting busier. We were surprised to find out that they offer a brunch buffet on the weekends - $18 for an alcoholic beverage and all you can eat. I had an incredibly strong frozen mimosa and too many foods to count. The short rib hash was my absolute favorite, but my make-your-own omelette, smoked salmon, and mac and cheese were tops as well. It was an amazing value and I will definitely be back for brunch on my next visit to the Burgh!",

If you love potato chips, the Chippendip is a must. Homemade chips fried to crispy perfection served with a side of opinion dip. Yum!   I ordered the burger with portabella mushrooms instead of a bun and a side of roasted veggies. The burger was perfectly cooked to medium. The veggies were seasoned with an unfamiliar taste and were not to my liking. Should have stuck with fries but I was trying to stay healthy and get my veggie servings in for the day.",

My friend and I wanted to sit outside and had some work to do. We tried to sit at a larger table. I reiterate that there was one person on the deck. We were asked to sit at a two top because they needed to reserve the larger tables for large parties. If they had been busy, I get it. I wouldn't have questioned it. But you have to be kidding. No one came to the restaurant in the hour or so that we were there. Had a large party come, we would've been happy to move to accommodate. Restaurants really need to reconsider this type of policy. This is not the first time I've been told that I couldn't sit at a larger table \"just in case.\"  At 2:30 on a Monday?!   I won't be back. We did end up sitting at the larger table, but it was clear that we were an inconvenience. We just wanted a couple of glasses of wine while we worked on a project and caught up.

Its a smallish place with a great drink menu.  The drinks arrived and were every bit as good looking as we anticipated.  However, upon consuming them - we tried 5 different ones, they were exceedingly average.  Perhaps the food is much better and this rating is unfair, but it really is more of a bar with food than a restaurant with a bar.  On the hipster scale, its probably 5 stars.  If your definition of a good drink is one that looks good and has alcohol, you'll like it here.  But if you want a drink that tastes as good as it looks, this isn't the right place for you.",

Must've gone downhill recently, new management or chefs or something. The cook is clearly lazy because our food was disappointing. The bacon cheeseburger tasted stale and old, like it had been left out for 6 hours before it was served. A very small portion of fries was soggy, and when we asked the waiter if he would replace them he came back with a cup full of more soggy fries and just carelessly dumped them on our plate. The menu is too busy, a lot of useless blabber on it -- just get to the point, I shouldn't have to read a novel to understand what I'm eating. I used to go to this place years ago and remembered the food being great, but when I took my guy here tonight I was embarrassed by my suggestion. Never again!",

Worth every penny!  Then on to the spinach/pesto stuffed meatloaf. Came with sauteed veggies. The entire plate was delicious...and came with enough food for leftovers.   Dessert was \"The Wrongest Ever.\"  It was so right. Deep fried tempura batter Twinkie with French vanilla ice cream in a raspberry sauce. Two spoons allowed me to physically fight off my fiance for the majority of this awesome creation.   Service--Mr White was our server and was great. Attentive, knowledgable and very friendly, as was the manager that stopped by our table.   Drinks-Great selection of craft brews in bottle and on tap.   We sat in the 2nd floor seating area, which I enjoyed as the downstairs can get a bit noisy from the bar crowd.   All in all, the best spur of the moment decision we could have made for a Friday night out. We discovered a True joy on Mt Washington!  Can't wait to head back!!!",

    "text": "So... how do I rate Shiloh?? This is tough. The server was super nice. The food actually tasted mostly good, when we finally got it.  Here's the problem... we had a reservation for 6 people at 7:30 pm on a Tuesday night.  We were seated right away. But... omg... who was running the kitchen?!!?????  1 HOUR to receive our food.  One. Hour. How is it even possible to BE that slow.  The restaurant was not packed at all. We were surrounded by mostly empty tables.  We ordered very simple items.  Pierogies  Mac n cheese Tater tots Quesadilla 2 delmonico sandwiches  We filled up on the baskets of bacon as we awaited our food. I love bacon as much as the next pork lover... but even I had my fill of bacon and just wanted my actual food. My poor kid fell asleep at the table cuz we were waiting so long!?!  The server really did his best to try to keep us from exploding.  Or just walking out.   But when the food finally arrived, none of us had any silverware.  One friend didnt get his food, so the rest of us let our food get cold as we awaited his order. The ranch dressing didnt come out til we were finished w our tots. The mac n cheese was TOO cheesy. And the tots were too salty.  We had to remind our server that we still needed silverware, my friend's quesadilla, and to please refill his water cup that he took from him and placed atop the table next to us!?!!  I did get the free bowl of chili w yelp check in at the beginning.  So I tried to eat that, and offered to share it w my table... but it wasnt any good.   So... as an out of towner, would I come back to Shiloh again?  Probably not.  There are a lot of offerings in the area who hopefully have better kitchen staff so the food gets out to patrons in a more reasonable time frame.  ** what really chaps my hide is when mgmt doesmt care enough to acknowledge a glaringly big problem such as this.**  I'm being VERY generous w 3 stars; I def rounded up.",

    "text": "A fine place to get a meal or drink while atop Mount Washington. I took family from out of town to Shiloh Grill as a place to eat before strolling Mt Washington to show off the glorious view of the City of Pittsburgh.  Menu is pretty typical salads and sandwiches and burgers. I went with the \"Pittsburgh\" steak salad which is a pretty a basic salad with French fries on it. As far as \"Pittsburgh\" salads go, this was pretty weak, with only like 6 or 7 fries on it. Asked for medium cooked steak and what I got was definitely more on the medium rare/rare range.   My wife got the bacon cheeseburger and seemed less than enthused about it. Though she did really enjoy the build-your-own mule menu and was pleased with the combination she concocted.  I will also say that between ordering from our waiter and overhearing a different table talk to their waiter, there were several items on the menu that they did not have. Don't know if this was something that happens a lot or a one-off.   Shiloh Grill was fine, definitely not horrible, but expected a little more.",

I opted for their crab cakes and they were delicious! They have both outdoor and indoor seating. The only thing is it took a bit for the food to come out.

When we showed up, it's as if communication must have broken down somewhere along the way and there was not only no table set up for us - - they quickly corrected that, thankfully -- but they were also sorely understaffed in the kitchen. Therefore, and unfortunately, our dinner took over an hour to come out. The manager was extremely apologetic  and comped us a round of drinks (excellent customer service, I'd say!). 2 of my colleagues got a quinoa dish they were less than thrilled with; they had hoped it would be warm but was cold).   The chili I ordered, on the other hand, hit the spot - - I grew up in Texas, so I can take some heat, and I thought the heat was just right (the childbirth-themed name of the chili was too impossible to resist, given we're a group of childbirth educators, lol!).   My friend recommended the local hard cider, and it was indeed pretty great. I liked the glass they served it in, too.  Not sure I'd necessarily go back, but I thought the manager's efforts to make amends were admirable and it was, overall, an enjoyable dinner.",

The cooks certainly know their way around cooking bacon because it is the perfect amount of crispy and there is minimal fat on each piece. Baskets have about 6 strips of bacon so there are plenty to share. I also ordered the Henny Penny which I thought was great. The chicken was nicely grilled and had cheddar cheese melted on top. Then the chipotle sauce added a spicy flavor and the tomatoes and lettuce balanced it out to be refreshing. I would have liked a bit more sauce, as the bun was so thick it made it slightly dry, but I still enjoyed my meal. Sandwiches and burgers also come with a side of fries that are nicely crisp. Prices of meals are reasonably priced for the portion sizes and delicious quality of the food so it's a win-win!",

    "text": "Came here for the first time for lunch on a weekday.  Hubs ordered their Henny Penny.  I ordered the roasted vegetable salad.  Rest of the family ordered their chicken quesadilla and the chippen dip burger.  What's Hot - Quality of food.  All our food was pretty good.  My roasted veggies were all warm and nicely seasoned, which added to the flavor of my salad.  The salad dressing wasn't as necessary, which was nice.  My brother in law liked his chicken quesadilla- good amount of cheese and good flavor.  It was a nice size, too.  Hubby's henny penny wasn't that spicy.  But to be fair, we have a high tolerance for spicy food.   - Menu.  Pretty good variety and options.  There were appetizers (including things like hummus), burgers, sandwiches, salads (with no meat), and sides.  They have options that are completely vegetarian, which is nice, too.     - Location.  Pretty close to the incline- only a few minutes walk away. - Price.  My salad was a little under $10.  Hubby's henny penny was a little under $10, as well.  Not a bad price for the quality of food and the amount of food.    What's Not - Service.  We waited over 10 minutes for the waitress to take our order.  We waited at least 30 minutes for our food.  This isn't a large restaurant.  When we were there, there was about 5 other tables- most of which were only 2 people.  It looked like there were 2 waitresses and maybe 1 other manager.  There was a bartender at their bar, which is to the side of the restaurant.  They don't look like they're adequately equipped to handle their business.      Final Answer Willing to come back, but not a first choice.  The only reason why this place is getting 3 stars is because of the quality of the food.",

    "text": "CM and I had dinner at the Shiloh Grill on the 4th of July after we found that another local restaurant (that shall remain unnamed) that took our reservation was closed for the holiday.  Given that I had a City Dining Card for Shiloh, after confirming that they were open, we headed over to grab a table.  Although all of the tables on the porch were occupied, several tables inside were available, so we were able to be seated right away.  Despite being seated right away, nobody came to take our drink orders until almost 10 min. later, after I made eye contact with a manager.  The waitress who took our drink orders offered the excuse that our waiter had to cover some tables both upstairs and downstairs, which is why he hadn't stopped by yet.  After 5 more minutes, he finally showed up with drinks redundant with the ones that'd already been delivered by someone else.  At that point, we were ready to order, so he took our food order.  Thankfully, the food came out reasonably quickly after that, but we weren't super pleased with the service, given the initial snafu.  Because we visited on the 4th of July, there was a special limited menu, but I was pleased to see that the prices appeared to be unchanged from the norm.  First, CM and I ordered a large mac and cheese to share ($12), which was brought out prior to the entrees per our request.  Despite looking rather dry on the top, the mac and cheese didn't disappoint, and was up to the standards of the mac and cheese we'd received from the Harris Grill in Shadyside.  For my entree, I ordered the Henny Penny spicy chicken sandwich ($9.99), and CM ordered the 4th of July blue plate special ($7.76), which came with two hot dogs, tater tots, and a slice of watermelon, and also got chili sauce on the hot dogs (+ $1).  The sauce on the Henny Penny sandwich was spicier than I expected, but placing the vegetables served on the plate on it helped dampen the heat a bit.  To be honest, the sandwich wasn't my favorite, but I know it's a popular menu item here, so if you enjoy really spicy food, you may like it more than I did.  CM's hot dogs were pretty standard, but the chili was a nice touch, dressing them up a bit.  Our respective sides were mediocre, being of the previously frozen variety, and my fries were disconcertingly limp.  CM also tried to take advantage of the Yelp check in offer of a free bowl of chili (worth $3.75), but after ordering it, we found out that we couldn't combine it with the City Dining Card discount (according to the fine print, this is the case--however, at least one other restaurant has let us double dip on discounts, so YMMV, I guess).  While I felt that the price: food ratio was decent here (total check: $24 after discount), unlike our last experience at Harris Grill, I also felt that our meal here was pretty forgettable, aside from the lackluster service.  (Our waiter even forget the doggie bag we requested for our leftovers.)  Everything about Shiloh Grill, from the menu to the setting to the service, was almost identical to its sister restaurant, the Harris Grill, so your opinion about Harris will transfer to Shiloh pretty well, and vice versa.  As such, my rating would be a by-the-book 3.5 stars (reflecting the PGH citywide average), but the inept service we received merits a decrease to 3.0.",

Not so much.  The menu is exactly the same as the Harris but every single time I've dined there there has been some sort of problem, ie we waited forever for our food, there was a hair in a salad (my friend is a hair dresser and in full disclosure she didnt even care--lol), an order was forgotten....  The last time I ate there I ordered the gazpacho and the Britney Spears.  The gazpacho came out so spicy it was inedible.  It was also salsa level chunky.  I took two bites and sent it back and told the waiter--maybe I got a chunk of pepper?  He agreed w me that it looked thick and I was very bummed out bc gazpacho is my favorite thing on the Harris menu.  One problem was that he clearly knew someone sitting at the table across from us and would stand there bs'ing with them while I was dying for a refill of water due to the Hellfire Strength gazpacho.  I again want to mention that the gazpacho is NEVER that spicy.  Brimstone shiz was going down in that bowl!  I finally went to the bar for water.  Our waiter never noticed.  I instead asked for mini mac n cheese.    The britney spears came out, two were burned and one was under cooked.  You just cant go wrong w the mac n cheese ever.  Its was honestly the high point of my whole day.  Then the check came and the gazpacho was still on it.  It too so long to get the check I just paid and left.  I'll not go back, I'm going to stick w the Harris.  And Redbeards, which is right next door.",

I was safe and stuck with one and a half (the half being my friends unfinished slightly melted one.) But I digress!   I am SO excited that this place is \"back.\" It was formerly known as the Shiloh Inn and was closed for a couple months and taken over by the owners of the Harris Grill. It saddened me when the Shiloh Inn closed down because although I love me some Redbeards, this was the only place to have a nice sit down dinner on this side of the mount.   Before, it kinda felt like a creepy old mansion rather than a hip restaurant. They've transformed it into a quaint and cozy little place! There was a warm !fireplace and it just felt very inviting inside, rather than the creepy before! I can't wait until they open up the deck outside because it's huge and a great place to sit and people watch in the summer!   I was REALLY trying to be good and get a salad (even though it had french fries and a bucket o' ranch on it) but I thought I would be doing myself a disservice, being that it was my \"first time\" there. I caved and found the most delish sounding eggplant noodleless lasagna. Since I am a proud Italian, I HAVE to have my Italian dishes a certain way. That means lots of sauce and LOTS of cheese! This came out perfectly! I only wish I could make eggplant this well at home (hence going elsewhere to get it!) It was many many thin layers of breaded eggplant with lots of sauce and spinach in between. The spinach factor, in my mind, evened out the mounds of mozzarella cheese loaded on top. The dish was huge and I'm not ashamed to say I...ATE IT ALL!   I'm so glad this place is here in my neighborhood! I hope that it's successful enough to stay around for a long time! I know I'll be back, especially in the summer when I can sit on the porch with a dozen frozen cosmo's surrounding me!",

For me, I needed something hearty, comforting, and of course, satisfying before a night out in the 'burgh! I was a first-timer, and hoping my visit will not be my last. Example, this is how they describe pierogies:   -- POLISH CHURCH BASEMENT PIEROGIES -- High-density dumplings from Poland, carefully assembled by nimble immigrant hands, and slathered in butter 'n onions. Dziadzio and Baci wouldn't steer you wrong. Eat, Najdrozsza, Eat!  For dinner, I chose the Build-a-bowl workshop with tater tots, braised short ribs, and the famous mac-n-chee sauce. Obviously, I was not going the healthy route. It was a Friday night, and I was not in the mood for a salad. Only calories and carbs. When the bowl came over, I wished I had ordered sides. The portion was not enough, and it was more of a \"six-spoons-in-and-then-dinner-is-over\" type of meal. It came in a size of cereal bowl in case you need to picture it. Now, looking back, I wish I could have ordered some of the pierogies listed above.   Like the food menu, the drink menu is pretty extensive and also an entertaining read. I ordered one of their tasty manhattans, and it was delicious!   I'd come here again, but will have to remember to order more or trying something that has more substance.",

I'll do happy hour because of the discounts, but I just really can't find any dishes that I feel are really worth paying for. The staff and atmosphere really make up for the food and that fact that it's a neighborhood joint keeps us coming back. They put so much effort into the menu and its creativity, but if they spent half of that time sprucing up the quality of the food, it would be a 5 star Yelp Review. We're Mt. Washingtonians, we want them to succeed, but the food is just currently \"meh.\"",

    "text": "Our group of 11 people--8 adults, two kids (under 10), and one infant had an amazing dinner at the Shiloh Grill on Saturday night. It was unseasonably mild and warm and we made an early dinner reservation, hoping to avoid the dinner rush and not intrude on others with our often-feisty/annoying offspring. I mentioned the kids when I made a reservation and a table was waiting for us upstairs, where we had the full run of the place until about 20 minutes before we left. I can't tell you how much I appreciate that they did that for us so that we didn't have to worry about disturbing other diners. We were catching up with out-of-town relatives, and we were able to do so easily being the only party seated upstairs. When the kids got antsy, we were able to let them roam a bit without worrying.  Our waiter, Trent, was awesome (and deserves a promotion, BTW). He helped us navigate the menu, was extremely attentive, knew to serve the kiddos first, and kept my pregnant self well-hydrated. Everyone in our party seemed very happy with their food choices. The kids loved the SOS (salad-on-a-stick), my husband and father raved about their steak sandwiches, my sister and cousin loved their salmon/quinoa/veggie bowls, and the original mac and cheese I had was awesome.   Prices were very reasonable for Mt. Washington and we all left very full, happy, and excited to return (maybe without the kids next time) :o)  Thanks to everyone there who made our experience a great family night out!",

Two years ago I would have readily given them 5 stars.  If you do decide to go here, ask for Miles or Brian's sections.  They're two of the best!  Food is cold, portions have shrunk and some members of the wait staff just don't care.  If you want to try this place, goto their other location (Harris Grill) instead.  They are still 5 star and live up to my expectations.    I think the management here at Shiloh is the difference!",

    "text": "I've been to Shiloh Grill quite a few times and so far I have never had a bad experience. To start it's a relatively small restaurant just off of Grandview. They have their own parking lot so if you're worried about parking they have you covered (not sure how big the lot is).   I almost always get a mac and cheese when I come here. Last night I got the steak mac and cheese. It did not let me down. It's a fairly large bowl with their homemade mac and cheese and a piece of marinated steak on top. There was plenty of cheese sauce and the steak was grilled perfectly. The marinade was a little bit on the sweet side but was still very good. My girlfriend got one of their build your own bowls and of course I tried it. The seasoning they use in it is what makes the bowl stand out.   This is definitely one of my favorite places to eat in the city. If you get a chance to go you probably should. Oh and whenever you finish their bowl of mac and cheese they tend to congratulate you which makes everything even better.",

I have only had the hummus and a tasty wheat beer (Southampton Double White) for lunch so my experience with the menu is limited, but what I had was solid good. The hummus is recommended; comes with a mix of warm pita bread and crispy pita bread. The crispy pita is on the heavier side, fried, but is very tasty. Others in my party had various items, including cheesy balls and salads, and seemed satisfied.      The service deserves far less than four stars. It took forever for them to take our orders at the beginning and then forever again to get our checks at the end. Granted, we were a party of ten or more but the restaurant was not crowded. I am still giving it four stars, though, as this might be an off day for our server.   The outdoor porch on a summer day is excellent. Beautiful location to experience the Mount Washington neighborhood.",

Service is lacking. Might check out the bar situation next time (their happy hour specials looked promising)",

But I think the cons outweigh them:  It took over an hour before our food came out. Two of us ordered apps (as our meal), one salad, one burger. One of the apps (hummus) was sold out. Okay, order something else - spinach dip. That came out twenty minutes later. Yet everything else came out a good 45 minutes after that. Very strange.  The burger was ordered medium rare. It was delivered medium well, at best.  When the diner who ordered the burger told the server it was overcooked and no, he didn't really want a replacement because he didn't want to wait for it, the manager came out. His \"sorry for the sucking\" was amusing, and much appreciated.  The spinach dip was way too garlicky, and I don't think I've ever thought ANYTHING was too garlicky. Fried cheese (Arsenal curds, woot!) were delicious, and the Popeye-something salad looked pretty good, too.  I think if Shiloh Grill focused less on being witty and more on service and quality, they could be awesome. But, well, they're not.",

Gone was the uptightness and in its place was a friendly, neighborhood restaurant. The downstairs is folksy and welcoming, and the upstairs has an elegant dining room. The menu is fun and will keep you busy- every menu item has a whimsical name and description.   I came here on a Sunday for the brunch buffet, and it was awesome. The chef at the omelet station made one of the fluffiest ad best-tasting omelets I've had in Pittsburgh. There was think link sausage, thick bacon. eggs, potatoes, fruit, french toast with accompanying raspberry reduction, and more. I was surprised by the cheesy grits (on a buffet!), and biscuits and sausage gravy, which had sage and other seasonings that made it very flavorful. The best part was that it cost $14 and came with an alcoholic beverage- I had a mimosa, but they also had a bloody mary, greyhound, or a screwdriver. If you're looking for a delicious brunch for a good price, make sure you try the Shiloh Grille.",

It was crowded there (we got a lot of butts in our faces), but we had a wonderful waitress who was super attentive and friendly. When I saw Mac and cheese on the menu, I knew it was the place for me. And then I found out it was customizable I fell in love. I'm a vegetarian, and our waitress told us she'd ask the chef to throw in some yummy veggies, and top it with blue cheese. We also ordered pierogis, which were good, but I wanted to lick the Mac and cheese bowl, it was that good! I've been dreaming about it since. My warm cider drink also did a great job of warming me up. Eat here and order Mac and cheese- you won't be sorry. But I'll be jealous.",

    "text": "Arrived in Pittsburgh late on a Friday and we were hungry. Shiloh was the right place to go to get my belly filled!  PROS  *Multiple versions of Mac & Cheese. I got the Hamburger Helper version. It was waaaay better than any Hamburger Helper I've ever had.  *Tasty beverages. They did some cool twists on whiskey drinks. I actually got the Happy Ending and it definitely made me happy.   *Spacious patio. We sat on the patio on one of the first nice nights of the year and snagged the last 4-top. It was perfect.  CONS  *Eclectic menu. This could be good or bad - they didn't really specialize in anything, but had something for everyone.   *Parking. We came in between the dinner and late night crowd, so we were lucky to get a close spot, but there didn't appear to be too many spots in general.  BOTTOM LINE Good grub. Good drinks. Good time.",

I eat tacos everywhere and some places skimp on the protein and full you with toppings.  Not the case here  The side of roasted veggies were great too.   Service was good.

Washington is a much easier trek than Shadyside so we decided to hit their sister restaurant Shiloh Grill today. So glad we did!   Shiloh is smaller but still just as cute with the same food & drink menu, which I've always loved. They also have a cute deck out front for some dining, drinking & people watching. It was only 50 degrees today but people were sitting out there soaking up some of our scarce sunshine. They also have their own parking lot - bonus!  We realized we'd never ordered Harris's calamari & it's pretty awesome. They are tossed in a sweet & spicy chili sauce that's a bit more heat than sweet and cooked to perfection.   I ordered one of my faves, the Henny Penny chicken sandwich & added bacon to it. I know this place is bacon friendly because Harris has done free bacon Tuesdays for years. I neglected to ask if they also do that at Shiloh. Yummy sandwich on ciabatta with a side of vinaigrette coleslaw with radishes & jalapenos.   My hubby ordered the meatballs & they were so flavorful & perfect. Plus when we got the bill it just listed 'Balls' on there, which made us laugh.   Our Green Flash IPAs were a tad pricey at $7 each but the good news is it's one of our favorites and was on tap. Service at the bar was attentive and fun. Our bartender was getting prepped for Sunday Brunch as she chatted to us & it sounded awesome. We know their drinks are stellar!  Nice to know we can have the advantages of Harris Grill with a closer drive to Mt. Washington to Shiloh Grill. Perhaps a return trip for brunch is in order.",

It was about 5 PM on a weekday.  I quickly scanned the outdoor menu and then we ran into Shiloh Grill.  There is a festive-looking bar on the left side, and a restaurant on the right side.  There were no kids in there, and my kids came barging in, dripping wet.  The employees there were SO nice to my kids.  It really made a difference.  The food was great, too - I got a steak salad that was really fresh.  My kids got various kids' meal things and they scarfed them all down.   Very pleased with this restaurant and will be back!   My only negative comment is that I don't think you should be responding to these reviews like you are ;)",

It was a bit of a hike from the station (up and down hills-streets), but we worked up an appetite on the way. The Shiloh Street area was cute and inviting. We arrived on a beautiful evening, and most of the seating on the patio was occupied,  The hostess offered us seating outside, with a bit of a wait, so we chose indoor. The atmosphere was casual and  nice. Hannah was our server, She did a great job. We decided, after looking around at other customers entrees, to order the signature, Mac and Cheese side, and the Stacked Eggplant entree,  The Eggplant came with a lovely salad, that we split. The Stacked Eggplant was delightful, a bit of crunch,  was different and delicious.  The side of Mac and Cheese did not disappoint. Was glad we ordered a side, as a full order, with the Eggplant would have been way too much food,  My only disappointment was that it was a Monday, and the service was super slow due to a couple of unexpected big parties. Hannah and the Manager were quick to  make things right for us, So I have no complaints.  I will definitely return here again, when I return to the area in the Falll.",

Placed an order for myself of soup and an appetizer for my daughter. We never received the order after an hour. I asked for the manager who didn't even care to listen to what I had to say... and walked away while I was talking to him. This place seems to cater to hipsters and if you aren't in their target market, they simply could care less. Will Never go back to this location or their other location the Harris Grill. Pretty sure the server was high and never put the order into the kitchen! We watched other tables served after us and people leave... and no one checked in on us. So if you are over 40 and have a child - they discriminate! If I could put zero stars - I would. Just awful! The worst! I have never been treated with such disregard. And I worked in the restaurant business for over a decade, I can't imagine delivering this type of service!",

I ordered the \"Just Damn Hot\" Buffalo wings with celery sticks and they were truthfully the best wings I've ever had. They weren't smothered in sauce but they weren't lacking any of it either. The presentation was lovely, and they have seriously delicious ranch dressing. I also ordered some fries and they were perfectly seasoned, not too much, not too little! My date ordered the \"Rick & Morty Szechuan Wubba Lubba Dub Dub\" wings and he loved them too! They tasted delicious too and came with a nice presentation of greens and celery sticks. You have the ability to pick a wing type, a sauce, and a dip, which is awesome and allows you to pick some really fun combos! The atmosphere indoors was soothing, hip, and fresh, and they added lots of Pittsburgh personality indoors and out. The outdoor seating area is very nice, with umbrellas to give you shade and a lovely view of Mt. Washington. Our waitress was incredible. She was so polite and upbeat, and never let us wait long for anything. I wish I knew her name to personally thank her, but she was one of the best waitresses I've ever had. The manager was very courteous and supported his staff very well, which was great to see! It's clear that the team gets along well, which only strengthens the enjoyment of all that Shiloh Grill has to offer. We had arrived around 2pm, and it was not horribly crowded like I thought it might be. It was very pleasant. Their bar area looked great and they have a large selection of drinks. We can't wait to return here soon, this is such a great spot and the staff should be so proud of themselves!",

We went during happy hour so the prices were VERY affordable. The service was awesome, atmosphere was relaxing (a little dark), and the food and drinks were good. And the BONUS... Free chili when you check in on Yelp.   Food wise, my friends and I shared the hummus, porgies, and the chili. The hummus was great, the porgies had a semi-weird potato cheese filling. The filling had good flavors it was just texturally weird. And the chili... My favorite part of the meal. It was so delicious, I highly recommend it.   Had a couple of frozen cocktails in addition to the food and the were very strong! Soooo worth the $3.50!   The one thing to keep in mind; however, is make sure you double check your check/receipt because my friend accidentally got charged for an additional appetizer. I wouldn't be saying this if the waiter didn't say it happens often.",

We put our kids food in first and told them we wanted it out before anything else so we could help them (they're 4 & 1). However, our food came out about 1-2 minutes after theirs did.

    "text": "Shiloh Grill is that cool, unassuming sibling we all pretend to have not known of in the Pittsburgh area.  Yes, it is True, Shiloh's sibling restaurant is that place in Shadyside called Harris Grill.  Yes, there are similarities between the two of them, but this place definitely stands on its own two feet.  From the moment you spot Shiloh you think, \"Nah, this can't be the place...I mean, it looks like somebody's house with a nice deck on it.\"  I did this myself, drove right past it and had to backtrack (we all know how hard that is to do on Mt. Washington).  But I believe that is what gives this place the charm it deserves.  It looks weathered and beaten, but in actuality it is the most welcoming spot on the Mount.  Inside gives you the same vibe, that vibe where you feel like you are inside somebody's house and are just in time to start enjoying the house party.  You are warmly greeted by the host/hostess at the door and guided to where you are to be within seconds.    The most recent visit I had here was for a birthday party.  This is quite possibly the best way to sample a wide variety of their food without having to order one of everything on the menu.  The standout star of the spread they had for the party was the pierogis.  Perfectly combined potato masterpieces that, with a dollop of sour cream, made this belly smile.  The drinks were perfect as well.  I stuck to a margarita all night, no salt and on the rocks.  I know I am using perfect in this review often, but that margarita was exactly that; perfect.  When the check came for the drinks (I combined mine with a friend) it didn't hit the pocket book too hard which was a nice surprise.  The servers here were spot on and pleasant as can be to work with.  They came around often to check on us and see if any of us needed a refill.  They never missed a beat and that made things run very smoothly for us.    If reviews had to be a one word summary, PERFECT would be the word to use for Shiloh.    Hey, guess what, this is my 800th review!  PERFECT!!!",

Some of my favorite dishes include: fried cheese curds (see above), crab cakes mcardle (who'da thunk, but yea they are delicious), all tacos on menu, and the arugula steak salad. The chili and mac & cheese are also delightful side choices.  Fun drink selection, too. Their \"Happy Ending\" singlehandedly got me through grad school.   The staff is always friendly and courteous and sometimes downright lovely.   That being said, there always seems to be at least one thing wrong with either mine or my husband's order (missing components, missing bacon, stray calamari sneaking it's way in with the cheese curds, bringing wrong drink orders, etc) Nothing that can't be forgiven and overshadowed by the yummy food.   I'm also not a fan of their brunch buffet. I know I'm in the minority with this one, but their waffles seriously need to step up their game. Also, everything always tastes like it's been sitting out. Which it HAS. So. There's that.",

I do, however, hear that they have an amazing brunch.   So Shiloh Grill is known for their mac and cheese, but I didn't really want something so heavy as my main entree. It doesn't come with any sides so I opted for something a little less rich: the chicken quesadilla. Meh. It didn't blow me away; the spices used to flavor the chicken almost didn't make sense for a quesadilla. It tasted like it was flavored with just oregano or thyme? I don't know what it was but I didn't favor it.   I will say that our waitress was great. She was so patient with me and my friend as it took us forever to decide. She was also incredibly helpful with describing the menu.   Will I come here again? Probably, to try out the brunch.",

The food was also delicious. I was expecting bar food and some good deals on drinks. We had an awesome happy hour selection (including drinks and $5 appetizers!) and our dinner meals were awesome! We thought the lobster Mac and cheese and the Build-a-Bowl options were delicious! The pirogies were so tasty with the portobello mushroom. Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Sunday was my first experience at Shiloh Grill. My friend is from the mount and a few of us got together for brunch. It was marathon weekend so we tried to avoid driving around to celebrate sundayfunday.  Their brunch is pretty awesome. Its a buffet, but an adorable one. It had different stations: Yogurt area (yogurt, fruit, granola),  a Hot Food spot (eggs, sausage, bacon, biscuits/gravy) Waffles/Pancakes (+ fruit & toppings), A lunch section (mac&cheese, jerk chicken, a little salad bar)  plus a toast & bagel bar which had tasty chive cream cheese and salmon. Most importantly, they had an employee ready to make you a personalized omelet. We arrived a little later for brunch (maybe 130) The staff was still on top of the buffet.   We decided to sit outside. For brunch, you can help yourself. We waited awhile for a server for drinks, then decided to head to buffet. We waited a little while for service even after eating. Luckily a manager noticed and took our drink order. My friends ordered a bloody mary and i ordered their frozen mimosa. Because of the wait, we were comp'd our meal. I'm only including this because that was super nice of the manager... he didnt have to do all of that. We were very thankful for his kindness.  We enjoyed our Sunday sitting outside and stuffing ourselves full of carbs and yogurt. I'm so excited to come back and try their dinner.",

    "text": "My friend and I decided to try Shiloh Grill over the weekend. We arrived right when they opened around 11:30 because we wanted to sit outside and outdoor seating did seem to fill up fast. The location is perfect since its within walking distance of the overlook and the incline.   We went with intentions of getting frozen mimosas, only to find out they are only available on Sunday's during brunch. You can still order a regular mimosa, frozen cosmopolitan or Bloody Mary. After looking over the menu I was slightly overwhelmed with having to read so much into each menu item. I can't remember the name of the meal I got, but I can tell you it was very tasty. It was Mac and cheese with sausage, bacon and an egg on top. I ended up taking half of my meal home because they give you a lot of food.   A little tip...a side does NOT come with your meal if you ordered off the Brady brunch menu. We were asked what we wanted our sides to be and we assumed it came with our meal only to find out when our bill arrived it was not included. This is by far one of my biggest pet peeves and it seems to happen often at restaurants these days.   I would like to go back on a Sunday to try their brunch buffet.",

I don't even know where to start. It didn't hurt that we were literally the first people in line, but talk about FRESH. I ate way too much, but thoroughly enjoyed everything, including: sausage gravy & biscuits; pulled/jerk chicken on top of mac n cheese, pancakes with the best berry compote EVER, bagels & lox, a custom omelette - okay, I'm going to stop there since I've already embarrassed myself. My point is, it is a ROBUST brunch and great for kiddos too. They charge $1 per each year of the child's age, so it's a good value as well. Most importantly, every adult buffet ($18.01/each) comes with a free cocktail (5 stars for their frozen cosmos), so drink (and eat) up, Yelpers!",

And on selection I'm not talking 5 star wines I'm talking wines I haven't tried that made me want more (I keep it classy I know). Lacee was the bartender and she kept us laughing she was awesome. We met a cool dude in there as well, just seemed like a very chill place overall. We were eating later so only had the wings. I will say they were some of the best I've had. Crispy and the sauce was . Definitely a place to check out. Has some nice vegetarian options and outdoor seating, as well as an event space upstairs.",

I had the \"Half Baked\" Italian which was actually really good but very heavy so even though it was the best thing I had ever tasted, I could not actually finish it. I would have given this place 5 stars, but I overheard staff talking shit about the guests the had just seated outdoors (we were the only couple inside that day).. I didn't really care that they were talking shit about the guests they seated because I worked in the service industry also, but you can't do it within earshot of other guests.",

    "text": "As a Mount Wash native for 5+ years, Shiloh was my go to spot. I only remembered to check-in via Yelp twice but I can assure you, I have been to Shiloh hundreds of times.   The great: Brunch, brunch and more brunch'n! AYCE buffet that includes an omelet bar, skillet potatoes with onions, scrambled eggs, sausage links, BACON, biscuits with spicy sausage gravy, waffles, cereal, muffins, two types of salads that vary depending on the Sunday you go, lunch type food that also varies but usually includes broccoli, their famous mac & cheese, jerk chicken, chili and a full spread of smoked salmon, capers, lettuce, tomato, onion, regular and dill cream cheese and bagels. Super NOMS! The brunch price of $17 also includes a boozy beverage! Frozen mimosa, greyhound, bloody mary or screwdriver. The frozen mimosa and bloody mary are my favorites.  Also great- Totchos on their regular menu. Imagine nachos....over fresh tots instead of corn chips. YES, they exist.   The good- The staff!! In my 5+ years of going to Shiloh, I have only had poor service once or twice. The bartender turnover isn't as quick as servers so they get to know their regulars and that makes for excellent service. Their regular menu that includes items that rotate or are added seasonally is a treat. My favorite- The roasted vegetable salad or just as a side. I don't know what Shiloh adds to this delectable dish but even the strongest of carnivores will fall deeply in love with these veggies. The drink menu is also on par with the food. Seasonal drinks and refreshing cocktails. Both menus are extremely well written. Sit back and enjoy them like a good, hilarious novel before placing your order. You won't regret it.   Also good- Happy Hour (get a frozen cosmo) and nightly specials. Tuesday is bacon night. Free baskets of bacon at the bar after 7pm. Enough said.  Just okay- hard cider selection. If nothing is on tap, Shiloh only has Strongbow in a bottle. Weak :( I also wish their Spring hours started earlier. They are only open for lunch during the Spring and summer.  Bad- Nothing, nada, loss for words. You get the idea. Head over to Shiloh for HH, dinner, BRUNCH, or late night. It will not disappoint!",

We were greeted warmly by someone and shown a table immediately for our group of four. Right next to this was another table and two in our group were cold and wanted to sit by the fire. We asked the lady that sat us and she said that was fine. We went to move the menus and the server yelled at us and told us that that was a table for five and we were four and they had people waiting, which they didn't. I must say also that there were other tables open....so there was no wait list to be seated. After he made such a big deal we quietly went back to our original table. Lucky us, he was our server. He then proceeded to berate me about moving to the other table and then went on to say all the things they were out of - almost 12 items!!!  He also said they made buffalo chicken dip but it was \"bad\" and they weren't serving it. When one in our group expressed disappointment, he proceeded to say well he would be happy to serve it to us. We got up and left. Disappointing service and attitude.  UPDATE:  I am updating my star rating to 3 stars from the previous 1 star. The owners and management took my comments seriously and reached out to me to find out more about what happened. They also had called in several staff members to inquire where the breakdown in service occurred.  Overall I feel they followed up, investigated and took action on my concerns with the employee. I think the owners and management acted responsible and acted quickly.",

    "text": "Now, I might be a little biased... having lived in Mt. Washington for so long I was at the Shiloh almost weekly. But with that, I can give a review encompassing all sorts of scenarios: dates, girls nights, holidays, room rentals, bar only, dining room, deck, weeknight, weekend, day drinking, night drinking etc.    This place gets 5 stars for all of the above with the exception of the dining experience being a 4. And bar only on the weekend gets a 4 as well.   The food is very good, I've tried so many things on the menu it's hard to recall them all! The reason it gets a 4 is because more often than not, something goes wrong with the food order. Whether it's blue cheese when I said to 86 it, or marinara sauce when I asked for cheese sauce.... thankfully the servers have always been more than gracious.   The bar is not very big and sometimes it gets really crowded so it can be difficult to get a drink in a timely fashion. I 150% recommend trying the Happy Ending... it is the most delicious, refreshing, amazing drink I've ever ever had.   I held my own birthday event in the upstairs banquet type room as well as attended a friends' birthday there. Scheduling was a breeze, the service was fantastic, and so was the experience. Intimate and welcoming.   My favorite part of Shiloh has to be the deck! Be careful, because weekend days it tends to fill up quickly. But something about sitting out there in the sunshine just makes the whole experience ten times better. I've never been disappointed in the few dozen times I've been out there. And, you can bring your pup! Well, last I was there you could anyway...",

I got the pulled pork on a pretzel bun, which was excellent (but needs some hot sauce, IMO) but I also got the Mac and cheese as my side, which was not awesome. I love Mac and cheese, and there was something just off about it. I couldn't tell if it was the noodles or the sauce that tasted like soap.

The location of Shiloh Grill is in Mount Washington, which really is great if you are going to explore the Mt. Washington lookouts and sights! The outside of the building looks cool with two sets of stairs on the left and right of building ascending to the entrance. This restaurant doesn't have as cool as a vibe as the Harris Grill does, in my opinion, but then again, I was seated close to the entree way on the first floor, maybe there is more to this building?! I was seated on a tall bar stool by the window, which allowed us room to sit and relax. The food was amazing. I ordered the turkey burger, which I love to get each time I come here! The service was great too! I enjoy the atmosphere of Harris Grill a little more, but the food the same and the Shiloh Grill is still a great restaurant!",

The feel is the same that I get at Harris Grill - casual, friendly, no BS - good drinks with good food.  I didn't have any of the food, but it smelled good, real good.    For a drink I had the aqua velva which was gin based and had sprite and blue curacao giving it a bright blue hue.  Total fan - the taste wasn't overly sweet which you might initially think when taking a look at it.  But it was good - it was light and refreshing, but be forewarned it's powerful.  You can't really taste the alcohol which could be a good or bad thing depending on how you want your night to end.  I was playing it safe so I didn't even finish the whole thing.  I'd definitely check this place out again and try out the food.",

I had the grilled/marinated chicken skewers, affectionately called the \"Britney Spears\" & my boyfriend had the lobster Mac n' Cheese. Both were delicious, and came out really quickly. Also, after 5, drinks & appetizers are half off! Totally recommend this place. Two thumbs up!",

    "text": "The Shiloh is exactly where you want to be after being in the snow preparing for a friend's 'biggest moment of his life.' After a memorable morning on Mount Washington's beautiful overlooks we shivered our way into the Shiloh for celebratory brunch.  Instantly, we were welcomed into a happy place filled with warmth, rich food, and great service. The fireplace was a necessity because we were frozen and I was glad to have a seat next to it. A round of mimosas came for us to toast to and while I am normally a welcoming fan to mimosas this one was a bit different. The juice was extremely tart, too tart for me. It left me with the post-teeth-brushing-teeth-and-then-drinking-OJ feeling.They normally don't have mimosa's on Saturdays so I can't complain (Thanks Shiloh!) but later a glass of champagne/sparking wine was perfect.  Food! Food! Food! One thing, even if you have an idea of what you want (burger, salad, sandwich, etc) READ THE MENU. Hilarity.   I opted for the arugula steak and blue cheese salad with a side of their popular mac and cheese. (yes, get the mac and cheese. Its creamy, and corkscrewy, and tasty.) I sampled the buffalo chicken dip and spinach dip that my friends ordered. Buffalo chicken dip was tasty but got salty with more and more tastes. Spinach dip was delicious and had a great amount of garlic in it. Definitely an indulgence worth repeating. I wish I had more than a salad but I just couldn't stomach it. Reviews for burgers tell me that they will be my go-to next time. The experience was great. The atmosphere was casual and definitely a place I can see myself revisiting!",

    "text": "When I first heard I was going to the Shiloh Grill, I had images of men led by Ulysses S. Grant with Grizzly Adams beards chomping into hardtack along the Tennessee River. Post visit, I can confidently report that the Shiloh Grill seems to be an easy going hangout where locals might go to enjoy friendly service and decent food.   So leave your Enfields at camp. I'm sure even you will be welcome here.  The restaurant is only a short walk from the Monongahela incline, so it should be on the radar of tourists who are taking in the view of Pittsburgh from atop Mt. Washington. The menu is a cleverly written culinary compendium full of local references interspersed with lascivious overtones.   But it's all in a SpongeBob SquarePants kind of way, so relax.    The building is of the type that belongs among popular seaside destinations. Wood shingles, an upraised deck and an inviting bar were all reminiscent of time well spent on Cape Cod. And as a New Englander, it struck me as a tad out of place, but it still seems to work - unlike the fireplaces, which are totally for show.  There's supposedly an element of the supernatural entwined in the building's history, but I'll let the natives speak to the veracity of Pittsburgh's ghostly lore.   My GF and I arrived at the Shiloh Grill about an hour before a family reunion of sorts. Like good bar flies, we spent the hour at the watering hole, chatting with our amiable bartender, who was not only a discerning beer enthusiast, but was also skilled in the fine art of mixology.   We were seated upstairs as the appointed hour neared. And since we had spent our afternoon shopping, among the wares we brought into the restaurant were a few bottles of Bordeaux.  Well, maybe more than a few.  When we were seated, our waiter charged us a nominal cork fee, so we were able to enjoy our own vino and were not beholden to the limited wine menu. Now onto the food.  Did I eat healthy? Hardly. That's not possible in Pittsburgh.  My Salad de la Burgh came with fries and veritable mountains of shredded provolone and mozzarella cheeses. It also came with marinated chicken tenders, which were cooked just right and retained ample flavor. So overall, I was very satisfied.   A great location, friendly staff and tasty food urge me to give the Shiloh Grill 5 stars, but the lack of a skyline view (come on, it's Mt. Washington!) and the sheer concentration of competitors offering comparable food in more scenic locales compel me to make deductions.",

    "text": "This is a place everyone should experience at least once. The menu itself is hilarious, with some great names for items and descriptions as well. The service I've received in both of my trips here was very good and also more helpful than you would find in most places as they actually took time to explain some menu questions instead of just giving the quick answer I've come to expect.  The best thing I've tried is Big Gay Al's strawberry chipotle BBQ wings. As a big fan of wings, different flavored wings, and chipotle flavor these were an excellent mix of some really interesting things. The sauce itself is so good that I would use it on other menu items and not just the wings.  They also love bacon there. The bacon night sounds amazing, though I'm usually in town only on weekends and haven't had a chance to try it. They also have bacon dry rub flavored wings that are worth trying for any bacon lover.   If I was going to recommend a place to eat in Mount Washington it would be Shiloh Grill over the more expensive Monterey Bay Fish Grotto and LeMont, both of which I've experienced as well.",

I didn't have a single care in the world as I practically loitered on their deck with a laptop, a plate of delicious hummus, and a water for well over two hours. And the service was awesome, my waiter was really cool and just let me be.  I wasn't particularly hungry for anything crazy which is why I ordered the hummus, but I will furrrr surreee come back and order something off of their very intriguing menu.   I happened to notice cans of Dale's Pale Ale behind the bar, and any place I've come across in my life that offers the best canned beer in the world (Dale's Pale Ale) has never been let me down.",

Then the hostess with a hook / ring in her nose sat us at a very small table so we asked for a larger one and she rolls her eyes at us. After sitting at the table for 15 minutes with very loud music playing we decided to ask to be seated outside  so that we won't have to yell at each other .  The hook nose hostess was upset and refused to let us seat wehete we wanted yo even tho it was raining outsude. Food was great and our waiter was good which gets the 2 stars.

He was very helpful and accurate in describing the many beers that were available. He was able to make suggestions based on what we told him we liked.  Next, the food was very, very good. The steak sandwich was great, as were the wings that I sampled. But most of all, (and thanks Gene, for the suggestion) this place has the best mac and cheese I've ever had.  I will be back on my next trip to Pittsburgh, and have toyed with the idea of another trip just to go here (well I'm sure I'll find something else to do while I'm in town).  Props to Shiloh!",

I went here over the weekend and when I walked in there were open tables in the downstairs dining area. But where did I get sent to eat? Upstairs, all alone with no one else. Why? Because I have visible tattoos, and who I believe is the head manager, I guess he did not want those \"types of patrons\" at this what-so-called \"eatery\" that discriminates against those with a few tattoos. Which is funny, because as soon as I got upstairs I headed back down to leave this place and as I looked over to the bar I saw the bartender with a couple of tattoos as well. You only let your bartender show visible ink, yet your patrons are not allowed? So your patrons who have them cant be seated with everyone else in this place, you have them sent upstairs? There were about 5 empty tables and no one waiting in line, there was no reason why I was not allowed to eat in the same room as everyone else. As I walked out of the place, the head manager and the hostess were laughing at me as I was walking out the door. Thank you for treating the people who come to your place like this. It's very respectful of you.",

It was mostly the people I met that kept me there longer than I would have otherwise. I went there because I was told the view of the city is good. There is no view of the city from its location, which disappointed me; however, misinformation isnt to discredit the establishment. The patrons (mostly btwn 25-40) were friendly and shared meaningful conversations.  The menu has a pleasant twist to the oldtime favorites offered at different places, although a few items infrequently offered, which I appreciated. The pumpkin sangria was surprisingly tasty, the steak sandwich has a nice spicey pop to it, the mac and cheese creamy (velveeta?), and the wait staff are quick to serve with knowledge about the menu. This was a great place, I am just unable to rate any tavern higher due to 'that' type of environment.",

Very limited selection of foods and what was on the buffet was cold and unappetizing.  Very sad excuse for a buffet brunch.  The corn muffins were dry and crunchy.  The fresh fruit on the buffet consisted of sections of red grapefruit and oranges.  There were no fresh veggies, no multigrain anything, no pasta salads, nothing at all interesting or healthy.  And the decaf coffee was horrible -- burnt tasting.  The only redeeming things were the made-to-order omelet station and the alcoholic drink that was included in the $14.99 price.

Not sure if this is a usual practice, but it was appreciated. The bagel/croissant was dry. The bacon (from the looks of it), not super crispy. Although I don't eat meat, I have yet to know a person who doesn't like crispy bacon. Potatoes were really good- very impressed with use of the red pepper in them.
