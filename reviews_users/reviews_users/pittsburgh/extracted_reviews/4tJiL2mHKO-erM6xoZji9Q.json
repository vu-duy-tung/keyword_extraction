The pizza is pretty good and the game day special (2013) is a large cheese pizza and a pitcher of domestic beer for $13.00.   The pizza is always fresh.  The sauce is delicious and the crust is a nice hand tossed thin crust.  I've never been disappointed.    The atmposphere is comfortable and the waitstaff are friendly.  It's definitly worth a stop in.",

    "text": "I was here for business and stayed at a nearby hotel in downtown. They delivered my food (free of charge), but they won't receive an extra star for that because of the TERRIBLE customer service AND they got my order wrong. I was really excited to try the steak ranchero because no. 1 - I love meat, no. 2 - I love french fries and no. 3 - I love ranch dressing! But to no avail, they gave me a plain old steak hoagie. At least they got the extra jalapenos right. Whoopty-freaking-do. The hoagie was definitely nothing to write home about.  Let's get to the terrible customer service... the dude who delivered my food got upset when I tried to pay with my credit card. I mean, don't get mad at me cuz your boss didn't ask me how I was gonna pay. Then, he doesn't give me a receipt. Isn't it customary to provide a copy of the receipt when you deliver on the east coast? I'm from California and that's freaking standard, man! Wouldn't you think if you're delivering to a hotel, the person is probably traveling for business and would need to provide supporting receipts in order to receive reimbursement for meal expenses? Come on now! So I kindly asked the hotel front desk to make a copy of the receipt. They were taking some time to make a copy so we stood there awkwardly trying NOT to make eye contact because it was OBVIOUS he was annoyed. Hey buddy, don't be upset with me because you hate your job! When I gave him the receipt and said thank you (yes, I still was polite even through all the awkwardness), he just walked away. No bye, no have a great night, no nothing. I don't know why I was expecting anything more from this guy.  Maybe I would have had a better experience if I walked in to place my order instead, but judging on the previous reviews, I highly doubt that.",

    "text": "Cafe Milano has been my go-to stop for inexpensive and yummy food ever since I was lead in there by my co-workers when I was working as an usher at Heinz Hall back in 2005.  This is a very casual, low-key restaurant, so anyone looking for a more high-end atmosphere is going to want to look elsewhere.  But if you want a place with terrific food and plentiful portions, this is the place to go.  Cafe Milano has really cleaned up it's act a lot just in the past couple years or so.  They have their kitchen and small eating area on their main floor and an actual dining room up on the second floor, and both of these areas have been remodeled and cleaned up a lot.  This place definitely used to fit the definitely of a \"whole-in-the-wall\" type of restaurant, but they've really improved the aesthetics of the restaurant, making it much more appealing for anyone glancing in from the sidewalk. The mood and service of the staff is kind of hit or miss.  The kitchen staff tends to be a bit cranky (I know they're quite moody on the phone) and I've heard the delivery guys are pretty rude, so that's definitely a downside. The attentiveness of the waitresses upstairs can range from really great to pretty distracted.  But then again, they have a lot to pay attention to.  If I come in on a weekday after work, there is always just one waitress attending to the entire dining room and everyone at the bar.  So if your service is on the slow side, I'm sure it's because your waitress is being pulled in wayyyy too many directions at once.  Now on the food.  My favorite items on the menu can be found in their hoagies and pizza section.  I stick with an 8\" hoagie (which is considered their \"half\" hoagie) and it's always plenty to eat.  My favorite hoagie is their ranchero steak, which is a steak hoagie topped with cheese, french fries, and ranch sauce.  Pssst, here's a little hint:  Ask for the buffalo fries in place of the french fries, it gives it a little extra kick and definitely stands out amidst all the meat, cheese, and sauce!  I also love the fish, eggplant, eggplant parm, and vegetable hoagies.  They all come fully stuffed with goodies and are so filling! Okay, pizzas.  Where to even start.  I guess if I had to pick a favorite it would be the broccoli & chicken.  Then of course there's the BBQ chicken, five cheese, ranchero (chicken), hawaiian.....I mean, they're all fabulous.  And they're generously portioned too.  A lot of these are considered gourmet pizzas so the prices are going to be higher than your basic pepperoni, but think of if this way:  If there are two of you, split a small.  If there's four, split a medium.  Trust me, you will have plenty to eat.  So now for the best part about this restaurant:  They're always open.  No not 24/7 open, but whenever a restaurant should be open, they're open.  Want a pizza at 11pm on a Wednesday night?  They're open.  Coming out a Sunday matinee performance and realizing that around 5pm the entire downtown area of Pittsburgh turns into a ghost town?  Cafe Milano will be open.  I can't tell you how many late dinners I've eaten at this restaurant over the years after coming out of a shift at work or a performance down the street.  It's just straight up, no frills, tasty as can be, comforting food.",

There was also a counter inside to place a full order, which is what we did. We then took a seat on the lower level   but later figured out that there is an upstairs area with a bar and waiter service.  Good to know if you're looking to get a beer with your pizza.  The pizza, however, is the same whether you order upstairs or downstairs.  And it's pretty decent.  This is a perfect stop after a ball game.",

On a visit earlier this week, they were out of coffee, out of guacamole, served cocktail sauce, not ketchup, with deep fried onion rings, and smothered their wings with overpowering barbecue sauce.  The only saving grace was a Tuscan chicken hoagie, which was very good.  That hoagie convinced me that if you want to have a good experience at Cafe Milano you better stick to things like pizza, hoagies or other standard Italian fare, apparently their strong points based on our visit.",

Ask her to make you a drink/shot that \"tastes good,\" and she will make you a very tasty concoction!!! I won't even order a drink if anyone else is working. They have a drink special everyday of the week. Some better than others, but you can get drinks for $3 a piece. And it's all day, not just for happy hour.  Now onto the food. The calzones are HUGE!!! Definitely split them with another person. They always arrive quick and hot.  Never had a bad sandwich here, but none stands out in my mind. Probably because I always have to get the kind my boyfriend likes.  Now for the PIZZA. This is absolutely the best pizza you can get in downtown. I know, I know, what's the difference? Pizza is pizza. Well, I don't know what they do to it but it's great!!! The maintenance guy in our building, who has lived there for 7+ years, got us turned onto it and now that is the only pizza we eat. You definitely gotta try it. We only get the pepperoni, and it's excellent!!! Have been wanting to try one of their specialty pizza's but they are a little out of my price-range (hmmm...booze or food?) But their prices are reasonable, especially for downtown. Definitely check it out.",

And as we all know, pizza's great the 2nd day.  Good pizza here, and if you can tear yourself away from work for a proper lunch hour, do like I did and get a couple of slices or a sandwich to go and take it over to a nearby plaza for a little al fresco dining.",

I am a huge crust person, and their crust was tasty! Great place to go at any time, but especially late night.  Service and food were both great.  and the pricing won't break the bank.  I would definitely recommend going here if in the downtown area.  We walked here from the Omni.",

    "text": "I went to Pizza Milano for lunch with a group of 5 coworkers on a casual Monday around 11:45AM (their choice).   I have been to the restaurant in the past and have had sub par food and service, so was not expecting much to begin with.   What ended up happening was one of the worst downtown dining experiences I have had to date.  To begin, our waitress took too long to come over to greet us.  Once she did all she said was \"you ready?\"  Sure ma'am... I guess we are.  We all ordered simple items, a small pepperoni pizza, small mushroom pizza and side salad, buffalo chicken salad, sandwich and onion rings, and I ordered a small broccoli pizza and a side salad.  We all ordered water or soft drinks.  I received my side salad first, with no silverware and packet dressing.  The other diner who ordered a side salad, never received hers.  The buffalo chicken salad came out next 5-7 minutes later.  Overall, the diner said it was fine and a good size, but again came with packet dressing.  Next came the pepperoni pizza (fine) and the mushroom pizza (also fine) - which came in the wrong size.  Still no silverware or drinks.  Finally,  we receive silverware and the sandwich and onion rings which were decent.  Still no drinks, and my pizza is nowhere to be found.  At this time, another waitress comes up to our table and proceeds to argue with our waitress IN FRONT OF US about she gave our diner the wrong pizza.  After their argument, I remind them that I am still missing my food and we are still lacking drinks.  We have now hit 12:20PM.  They clearly forgot my Pizza all together, because 10 minutes later they tell me they are cooking it and it should be out soon.  I received my pizza at 12:45 after one of our diners had to leave to go back to work.  No apology, no admittance of the mess up, nothing.  Once I received my pizza, it was fine, but overall the quality of the food here does not compare with other places.   We finally received our checks at 1:15PM which were incorrect (at this point expected).  They made zero effort to rectify the many mistakes other than telling me that they took $1.50 off of my check.    Needless to say, Cafe Milano will no longer be receiving my business as there are MANY other Pizza restaurants in downtown which exceed them in both service and food quality.  I would highly recommend going to Monte Cellos or Giovanni's instead when you are looking for a quick pizza lunch downtown.",

None of them pour drinks consistently. They never ask you for a refill or if you'd like another drink. They actually barely ever speak to customers just each other. The girl bartender was actually sitting on the floor behind the bar on her phone at one point for about 5-10 minutes. I realize they're young but come on..... There was also a period of about 15 minutes where there was NO ONE behind the bar at all. Then, one of them had the audacity to whine about being stiffed by the people next to us. WHY ARE YOU SURPRISED??? The best part of that is the other guy telling him to just add money to their check to make up for it. Right in front of other customers. Trust me if the game wasn't on I would have left after the first five minutes of being there.   Pizza - great Wings - can't really cook a wing wrong  Drinks - sometimes too strong sometimes just juice  If I ever came back here it would be for takeout pizza only. The managers/owners need to get a handle on this place for real.",

I'm giving this place 3 stars because of the food and nothing else.  The pizza is GREAT!  I've read other reviews and saw folks trashing it, but I always get a slice of pepperoni and it's enough to fill me up before the game and it tastes great.  The last time I was in Pittsburgh was for the Patriots game.  We got to Pittsburgh early and as per usual went to Cafe Milano to eat and hangout.  We're sitting there eating, drinking and watching the early game in London and then out of nowhere the check is put on our table by the mean looking waitress.  If you've been there more than once, you know who I'm talking about.  She doesn't ask us if we're done or if we want anything else - just plops it down.  WTF!  We were one of only maybe 3 tables in all of the upstairs area. Like I said, I've been here dozens of times and have never had this happen before.  What I've always seen before and have noticed numerous times is that she NEVER smiles or extends any kind of pleasantries with my party.  I'm not the type to complain, but shit, when you voluntarily work in a business that deals with customers - try treating them more than like they're a pain in your ass and doing you a favor for being there.    We found a better spot a couple doors down after the game.  That place is our new \"go to\" before all Steelers games going forward.",

When we finally got our pizza we had 10 minutes left to eat it. The pizza lacked flavor. It was very bland. I was bummed. I was glad we only ordered a small. It was inexpensive thankfully.

One of the more memorable items on the list is something I urge you to order if you are ever in an adventurous mood. The Ranchero Pie is the mother of all pizza. What will taste like Heaven in your mouth can soon turn to a cheese covered Hell if you are foolish enough to take on a medium pizza of this ranchero'ness by yourself. 4 hours, eat one Ranchero Pie, that is my challenge to you, the last man to take on this challenge only succeeded by using his own tears as lubrication as he slid the last slice into his gullet.   Pizza challenge aside, the food is pretty good, some of the better pizzas I have had and if you aren't in the mood for that, they have plenty of other items like calzones, pasta, salads and hoagies if that's where you find your appetite to be. If you are in delivery range, give them a go and if you are up for a challenge...take my pizza challenge....I dare you.",

The downstairs area for family is extremely convenient for me and my friends, since none of us likes to be around children. The upstairs is where the magic happens. It's where they keep the bar, the soft drinks, and the bathrooms. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. I've only ever ordered one thing: Mediterranean pizza. They are one of the few places that still has this kind of pizza and it just so happy happens to be my ultimate favorite pizza. Nowhere else has it. It has been the perfect place for me and my friends, as we have eaten there every Wednesday night at five o'clock (back in the old days) where we made memories and ate amazing pizza. Highly highly highly recommend!",

There is almost never a wait at Cafe Milano and the food is consistently good. It's not pizza that will change your life, but they make a solid pie. The crust is your standard chewy Pittsburgh pizza crust, the cheese and toppings are plentiful, and their red sauce is flavorful, if not a bit on the sweet side. They also offer a variety of specialty pizzas that are delicious...most recently we ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and weren't disappointed. The service every time we've been there has been friendly and we usually get our food rather quickly (which is important when you're trying to make a show or other event). The main restaurant area is upstairs and then they have a take-out counter and seating on the lower level when you first walk in. During Pirates games, they're usually outside selling big slices of pizza for a few bucks, which is a cheap and tasty option if you need to eat on the run before the game. Overall, I think it's definitely one of the better options downtown for quick, inexpensive, and tasty pizza.",

People slowly came in after our group sat down but not enough to fill the place. Our group of 13 ordered two extra large pies to share with a few also ordering salads. Our waitress might have been new as she seemed new and unsure of most of the questions we were asking her. She was definitely quite flustered with a group of 13, which is to be expected.   The pizza was pretty average: what you'd expect of typical pizza fare. Pricing was also average, but lunch specials seemed to be good deals. Although the extra large pie was pretty large, the slices were really small. I guess this is ok for big groups, yet three slices was like one normal slice if you ordered pizza by the slice.   Overall, I'm not sure when I'll come back as there are so many other good places in town, although I wouldn't eliminate it as an option completely.",

    "text": "I visited Cafe Milano tonight solo for a quick dinner before seeing Phantom of the Opera at the Benedum.  I approached the counter and first asked if they had any dinner specials, which they didn't.  In light of that, I attempted to order a mini (6\") pie, which the woman behind the counter told me that I didn't want, since it was \"retardedly small.\"  I told her I usually order two slices of pizza, and asked her which size I should get, and she said the small, and maybe even the medium.  \"Really?  It's just for me.\" I said, and proceeded to order a plain small ($8.12 w/ tax).  I'm glad I used my common sense, since I wasn't looking for leftovers since I was going to the show afterward.  Indeed, when the small showed up, it ended up being about twice as much as I usually order.  The pizza took about 10 minutes to prepare, and was served piping hot to me at my table by the woman I'd ordered from.  Another odd exchange with her ensued when I asked her for parmesan and oregano, to which she responded they didn't have the latter (what pizza place doesn't have oregano or Italian seasoning?!?), but she could bring me parsley.  In terms of quality, I found the pie resoundingly average, with a sweet, non-crispy crust, a bland sauce, and nondescript cheese.  This pie was on the level of a Mineo's--and that's not a compliment.  However, it was at least filling--which it better have been, given that it contained twice as many slices as I usually eat--so it sustained me through the show without a problem.  Overall, I was underwhelmed by my experience at Cafe Milano, despite that I don't exactly have high expectations of pizza parlors.  I was particularly put off by the high-pressure upselling tactics of the woman I dealt with--perhaps the sales techniques of Christos next door are rubbing off on Milano's employees?  In any case, next time I'm looking for a casual, inexpensive pizza slice or pie in the Cultural District, I'll look elsewhere.",

    "text": "Decided I'd do the \"lunch special #10\" which comes with a slice of pizza, small salad and a medium drink for $6.90. It's a dollar extra for each pizza topping; I elected to splurge the extra buck and get pepperoni on my slice. While in line I noticed the hoagies that were being served... they looked really good and I almost changed my mind. \"Maybe next time\", I thought. At 12:22 PM I placed the order, paid my total of $8.45 (including tax), was asked if this order was for \"eat in or to go\" (it was for \"eat in\") and I found a table to sit down at.  The salad came out quickly. It was fresh with what you would expect; lettuce, tomato, spinach, cucumber and onion. But what made me smile is that they had raspberry vinaigrette available. My favorite! I enjoyed the salad while waiting for my slice.   I did notice while waiting and watching Sports Center on the TV above the checkout counter that the dining area is kept remarkably clean. \"Good for them\", I thought. But as I continued to wait and watch Sport Center, twenty minutes later, for a single slice of pepperoni pizza, I couldn't help but notice that there were only five other customers in the dining area (three of which already had their food) and I began to wonder if I was going to be late (again) returning to the office.  25 minutes later, no slice.   At 12:50 I inquired about the single slice of pepperoni pizza and requested it in a \"to go\" box. I walked out the door with a single slice of pepperoni pizza in a box at 12:58.  I enjoyed my single slice of pepperoni pizza back at the office. It was a large slice with a generous amount of pepperoni and it tasted pretty good. Not the warmest slice I ever had, mind you, but it was tasty.   I doubt though that I'll ever find the time to see if the hoagies are any good.",

The other thing I love about Cafe Milano is they sell pizza on the sidwalk before Pirates games. I always grab a slice before going in - the quality is much better than anything you could find inside PNC Park, the slices are huge, and they're only $3! Can't beat that. It is cash only (for the pre-game pizza), so keep that in mind.",

On a recent visit, Kay, myself, and some friends took on an extra large (16 cuts) pizza platter that was embellished with gorgeously, scrumptiously caramelized bacon and red onions. A tremendous pizza that stands on a platform above many in the area, it comes strongly recommended from me, a man who eats far too many of them.   What underwhelmed me were the brown, overdone fries, which also came off as bagged and frozen and not at all properly freshly cut.   When we dined here, the upstairs dining room was buzzing with activity and packed with hungry customers. The poor staff, including our kind and incredibly photogenic server, were almost overcome by the deluge of commerce on an insanely busy Friday night. Despite that, the service was on-point for the most part, our waitress earning herself a hefty tip for what might as well have been combat pay.",
