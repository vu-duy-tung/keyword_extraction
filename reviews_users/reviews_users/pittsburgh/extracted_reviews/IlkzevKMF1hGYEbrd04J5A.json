Sitting at the bar is really nice, there are at least 5 TVs to watch your favorite sporting event on-- there is also a shuffle board table and I see groups meeting here for after-work drinks often.  The food is A+ bar food, I love the Reuben sandwich and every night they have some themed drink special night. I think Thursday night is ladies night and on Friday they have free wings from 5-7. The last time I went I watched the U.S. Open Women's Semi-finals and the wings did not disappoint!",

Too many times we've been disappointed and say...\"Let's just go to Silky's next time.\" Recenty that has morphed into just going to Silky's when we want a simple but good meal. Their burgers are very good,  as are the salads, sandwiches and appetizers. And the specials are creative. Certainly it's not five-star dining, or anything remotely gourmet, but for the kind of food they do, they do very, very well. Burgers, sandwiches, salads, basic appetizers. Cozy atmosphere. Gets a little loud on Friday and Saturday nights after 9 or 10 p.m. when the college crowd rolls in, but it's tolerable. Two thumbs up.",

Enough to keep me entertained even if all I'm doing is drinking by myself... but I'm blessed with good company. There are also strings of lights all over the eaves that makes me feel like it's Christmas. The music selection is a little odd with its random variety - or is that the jukebox's fault?  The food was pretty delish, with good prices for decent portions. I loved the BBQ Turkey and Bacon Sandwich and the Seafood Chowder. The bf also noted that although the Chicken Fettucine isn't on the regular menu, you can still order it. The service can be hit or miss as it does get pretty busy for one waitress in a full bar.  Now I just need to find somebody in Pittsburgh who can mix me a Black Opal.",

I will never try the pasta. Anyone who goes to a bar and eats pasta and thinks it might actually be good or authentic is delusional. I don't really fit in in this place, but there's bacon.

    "text": "Went here after Little Italy Days in Bloomfield.  After buying three beers at the bar, and getting carded, my party of three sat down at a table.  We received no attention from the waitstaff.  When I went back up to the bar to buy another round for my party, I was carded again, by the same bartender with glasses and short hair.  At that point, I was told that I could not buy beers for my party, even though we had all already presented our IDs initially, and that he would need to see everyone's IDs again.  I went back to my table, collected everyone's IDs, and then presented them to the bartender.  He flipped out, and told me to get service from the wait staff.  Meanwhile, the wait staff thought we were being taking care of at the bar.  So rather than waiting to flag down the waitresses, all three of us went up to the bar, presented our IDs.  The bartender who had lashed out at me ignored us completely.  In fact he walked by is several times and  emptied the trash, rather than attend to our order.  Thankfully the other bartender took care of us.  I've been here before, and hadn't had bad experience, but tonight was awful.",

The food is all kind of dumpy and gross.  They had good food at one point, but for the last few years its been on the bad side.

I always get the home fries on the side, which are cooked with onions and fried jalapenos (!).  Great waitresses, too.

It is as close as I can define a \"Sports Pub\", with the tvs showing sports, but with the British Pub decor, and not spilling over the brim with sports fans.  They have good solid pub food which is tasty and with big portions.  The food is always above par and I don't ever think I've had something I wouldn't order again.  I even got a grilled cheese and loved it!!  There is a bit of sticker shock, when you see a sandwich for around 8 bucks, but the sides and the taste make up the difference.  They have some good beers on tap, and you can spend a pretty penny, or you can get a pitcher of Yeungling pretty cheap and just  hang out and play shuffleboard if you like.  The atmosphere is good and friendly, and they have tables outside in the summer.  The jukebox does leave many songs to question, but overall it is a good mix.  There is only street parking, but you usually don't have to walk far.  I'm glad this is my neighborhood pub, and I'll be back, so glad it's gone smoke free!",

This was my first visit to the Bloomfield location and was rather underwhelmed.  The place was packed with Friday evening happy hour go-ers, which was fine.  My friend and I were really in search of food rather than drink, though.  We sat at the bar and so it took a while for the bartender (one of two) to take our orders.  It then took approx. 40 minutes for our food to arrive.  I ordered a wrap and my friend ordered a sandwich.  My order was fine, my friend's was nothing close to what she had ordered.  She then had to wait another 20 minutes for the correct sandwich to be delivered.  Of course, we understand that mistakes happen.  However, what was truly frustrating was the fact no one else in the entire bar appeared to be eating (just drinking) with the exception of one table that had ordered one plate of wings.  So, was the kitchen so backed up that it should have taken so long for our food to arrive?  Where they so crazy busy back there that they got confused and prepared the wrong sandwich?  In addition, and I do find this to be an isolated occurance, I was ill for essentially the entire weekend after eating here on a Friday night.  I won't take Silky's off my list entirely because it is close to my house.  My wrap was good and the staff was friendly.  The place was packed and so that says something positive to me.",

    "text": "Captain's Log Stardate: Circa 2004 - 2006-ish... I lived about an hour and a half outside of the city. Coming here was usually pretty exciting. (Here as in the city, not Silky's.) I had a friend who lived here in the East End and on the street I reside on now.   Several times we found ourselves at Silky's Pub. I love the corner building, the way it looks out onto Liberty Ave. It looks so welcoming. Especially in the summer. Outdoor seating, always pretty well packed with people.  I'll come right out and say that the crowd that frequents Silky's isn't my usual crowd, but unlike some bars I'd never had an issue with someone wanting to start a fight with us because we look like a bunch of dirty malcontents. This place is just not our usual dive bar.  Thursday night my boyfriend texted me that he was there with a mutual friend. Living less than a city block from there I headed over. I needed a beer and some hockey/world series action to distract me after the Halloween parade. It was as busy as usual. A few seats remaining and I managed to snag one right at the bar, front and center.  I hate to say this because I don't remember this happening years ago when I went there. I was not even acknowledged. I get flagging down a bartender in a crazy busy bar in the South Side on a Friday night. I don't like it but I get it. This was a moderately steady Thursday night. I wasn't standing behind the people's sitting at the bar. I was the person sitting at the bar. There were two male bartenders both bartenders asked the guy next to me multiple times if he wanted anything else to drink.   By \"multiple times\" I mean 6 or 8 times. The person sitting directly beside me. They wouldn't look at me. I tried to make eye contact with either of them and it was as if I wasn't even there. Eventually the boyfriend's beer emptied as well. This is about 20 minutes after I arrived. I've had people walk in and stand behind us and the bar tender or waitress was on them immediately. After another 5 minutes of the boyfriend's beer being perched precariously on the edge of the bar and the bartenders standing there chatting he had to ask the bartender for a refill and if I could have a drink.  The bartender looks up at him, grabs his pint glass angrily from the bar and says, \"Oh, you wanted another?\"   Really? I was so angry at that point that it took everything I had not to ask the guy what his issue was.  I later saw him drop a pint glass and stumble into something so many he was drunk.  The food that other people ordered smelled and looked great. Even the seafoody bits which I normally hate smelling. The tv's are plentiful and newer. I just don't know if I'll ever get to go back and try the food as I hate being slighted by a business owner and treated as if my business isn't appreciated.",

    "text": "I started out really disliking the food at Silky's...especially where there are better 'bar food' options within a mile.    But, they've won me over.  A little bit.  I'll call them average.  Wings - still underwhelmed.  They are a dry rub (unless you get a bbq).  And usually overcooked.  I like my wings well done, but these are always so average - I don't even order them here anymore.  Burgers and Sandwiches are pretty good.  Buffalo chicken wrap was solid.  Burger (off the special menu) got the job done.  Waffle fries - very good.  I think because they are very crispy.  Based on the bacon reviews below - i think the general rule is they are good at frying the hell out of something...sometimes for good - sometimes for bad.  What redeems this place beyond the average food - is the layout and outdoor seating.  It beats other bloomfield bars given it's greater amount of seating and better views of tv screens.  Also, it has the most outdoor seating.  Not tons - but if you get there at a decent hour - still possible to get a table.  Silky's usually makes the list to watch a game or if weather calls for outdoor drinking.",

The atmosphere and staff are exactly what we look for in a place.  Silky's balances the line between trendy, divy, and sporty all at once and actually pulls it off.  They have a few TVs which always is showing the big game and usually has good specials during Penguin and Steeler games. Silky's also boasts a shuffleboard table and darts to keep people busy and having fun.  The shuffleboard is a must to try. 2.  The beer and food are grade A bar quality.  Nothing pretentious here, just good wings, a huge burger, and unique selections.  The beer list isn't huge, but they do carry a few microbrews and some of the local swill.   3.  No smoking.   Silky's in Bloomfield also has plenty of tables and bar stools and isn't over run with drunk yinzers it attracts a mix of college students, young professionals, and old dudes from the Bloomfield area.    If you're searching for a new bar to have some food, play some games, and drink a beer look no further than The 'Chester.",

Plenty of flat screen TVs to catch the big game, though not sure what their channel options are for out of town games.  I'd have to go back to investigate.  Otherwise, the service was solid, the drink menu was decent, and the food was good.  I had the nachos which were pretty average to slightly above average in nature.  The guacamole was actually good though.  Nothing to write home about, but decent enough to enjoy.  And yes, I'm a stickler when it comes to guac.  Overall, I'm giving this place 4 stars because this is simply a cool place to chill after a long day at work.  Give it a try and see what you think.",

The only problem that our party of 6 had was the way the place was set up, they don't allow smoking inside but they should of. All of the smokers were standing outside in front of a giant sliding, garage style door and all of the smoke was sucked back into the bar.   All of us agreed this is the worst place we have been in for smoke and some of our group were smokers, they didn't even like it. So if your idea is to sit inside a smokey hazy bar you will love it, but to sit in that atmosphere and dine was impossible. We left for cleaner air.",

Thankfully, my friends took me to Silky's and reminded me that it's worth it to cross the river now and then for a drink.   The bar food is quality -- I highly recommend the fried zucchini. There's also the Munchies Platter, with provolone sticks, onion rings, chicken wings. It is so massive, my arteries almost went on strike. Crowd is good company, bathrooms are surprisingly clean, and there's about five TVs for your viewing pleasure. If I lived in Bloomfield, I'd definitely be more of a regular.",

They had an October fest German style feast as a special but the potato pancakes were straight from ore Ida in the giant eagle freezer section. Very disappointed there. Not one sandwich under 10$ but maybe that's the going rate over that way.

Usually there's parking in front but there's none at this place or even across the street.",

We were asked how we wanted the burgers cooked but they came out \"done af\" but after an hour how else would they have come out, food ended up just being middle of the road especially for Liberty Ave. The waitress was nice and had to work the whole floor herself while constantly reminding the bartender she had drink tickets that needed filled.

I checked Yelp and saw that this place had some decent reviews, so thought I would give it a try.  There weren't too many people there when I walked in, so I went right up and sat at the bar.  I was greeted right away by the bartender (Bill).  He told me which three beers he was out of (which unfortunately were the three best ones on draft), then took my order.  I started with some wings and a beer.  I only order a half dozen of the atomic flavored wings which was unfortunate, as they were some of the best wings I've had in quite a while.  As a comparison, they weren't as hot as Buffalo Wild Wings 'hot' wings, but had decent heat and great flavor.  I then had another beer and ordered a meal they had on special.  It's not what I would call bar food by any means, as it was a perfectly cooked baked chicken with vegetables and potatoes.  I got a cup of cheddar and lager soup as part of the meal too which was wonderful.  Overall, I was glad to stumble across this place.  As others mentioned, it seemed to tailor to an older crowd (30-49 seemed to be the median age when I was there).  I would have given it 5 stars had they been fully stocked on their draft beer.  I like to drink unique or uncommon beers when traveling and had to settle for Molson that night.",

The place is never empty, but it's also never too full where you can't get a table. The crowd is a mixed bag, but like many bars in Pittsburgh, I've never felt out of place there.  Silky's has a slightly above average tap list that often includes Southern Tier, Fat Heads, or Great Lakes. I have been disappointed several times when the tap list has changed but not the menu. I get my heart set on a beer, only to find out the keg has been tapped. No complaints though, there is always something else to try.   I haven't had much food here, but the waffles fries are a great candidate for a late night bite.  Silky's has several dart boards, and a shuffle board table along the window. If you get here early enough, you can get in a few shuffle board games before someone else takes a turn.   When the weather is nice, the patio is a great option. There's potential for good people watching on Liberty Ave most days. However, asthmatics be forewarned, the bar is non-smoking, but the patio is not.",

On the contrary, Silky's burgers are delicious and they have some non-standard fare like the Stuffed Peppers that are always crowd pleasers.   The Bloomfield location has the additional benefit of some nice outdoor seating on the quieter end of Liberty Ave., indoor shuffleboard, good sports watching TVs, and a jukebox.  There are lots of bars to choose from in Bloomfield, but Silky's makes a strong play to be your go-to neighborhood hangout.",

It took forever for our appetizer and food to come out to the table. My tacos were so soggy I couldn't pick the second one up, i ate it with a fork. The juice from the tacos also made the tater tots extremely soggy.  Everyone else in my group was disappointed in some way with our visit.",

It wasn't crowded at all... surprisingly.   We all tried their pumpkin spice martini which is OUT OF THIS WORLD! I highly recommend it to everyone. It is so good!   The food on the other hand is just your standard pub fare. It doesn't taste particularly better than any food you'd get at any other pub. It was just okay. I had a buffalo chicken wrap which was good.   Our waitress was on top of things which was nice, but then again, how could you not be on a slow night without many tables right?   Anyway, we had a fun time here. As for the food, I probably wouldn't go back JUST for the food. If I were meeting  a group of people here, I'd definitely come back, but on my own, maybe not.",

    "text": "We came in on a Wednesday night and found a good local crowd. It's our first time and we were a bit confused as to whether it was seat yourself or wait for a table. We meandered our way in and found started to look for a table and look at the beer list when a waitress greeted us and ask if we wanted a table or bar seating. We settled on a comfy high top and ordered drinks. Alas, the craft draft list was only IPAs. Blast, but we'll do.  For food, I ordered the Crow's Nest crab cake bites, which came with fries and coleslaw. Hubs got the taco salad. The food arrived and portions are large. Unfortunately, my food was barely warm. It tasted as though it had been ready long before it arrived to the table. Hub's salad was standard pub fare, though no dressing required.  The vibe is neighborhoody. It was nice out, so they left the doors open which gave it a nice breeze. Music is strange as it was very eclectic. Overall, it's good service, nice atmosphere, though food is average.",

Perfect for watching a Pens game or grabbing a drink with friends. They have great selection of draft beers and wines.   We ended up going to Silky's around 6:30pm on a Saturday night. To start - we ordered drinks from the bar, and you get a jar of pretzel sticks to eat. Perfect for snacking.   Next up, I ordered the delicious clam chowder- I always grab a bowl, but it is that good. For appetizer - we split the mozzarella sticks - they were also very good.   For my entree, I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap with the waffle fries. It was so good. They also have the most delicious ranch dressing.   Heads up - sometimes the service can be slow, but the food is always worth.",

Which, in it of itself, isn't a bad thing, except that the service was horrible. After I walked in it took forever to get the waitress' attention. She was busy talking to another server. The bartender had to approach her and even after that it took forever. She didn't offer me water and was just nowhere to be seen.  I will never come here again. It's August 21, 2018, 9 pm.",

Also, the presentation of the food is better than I expected for a laid back pub. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the cole slaw. It wasn't bad, I just feel like it could have been better, it was a bit bland.   Either way, I enjoyed my meal. I got the bang bang burger which was a special. It has a spicy sauce on top, and it was perfectly cooked medium as I requested.  My friend got a chicken bacon cheddar wrap which was good, and the waffle fries were on point. Nice and crispy.  Oh, and the ranch is bomb! Bad ranch just kills my meal, so that was nice.   Other than that, they have a great bar space with TVs. I'll be going back here!",

    "text": "Until a few weeks ago the only time I'd been to Silky's was on a terrible date...he was a messy eater and generally ruined any good impression the place could have made on me. All that changed when my boyfriend and I decided to check it out for Sunday dinner one evening. We were very hungry and seeking a nice little neighborhood pub sort of place near our new house. I'm happy to say Silky's ended up being just what we were hoping to find!  It was dark and sort of cozy-feeling inside when we walked in. I liked how chill the vibe was. We immediately seated ourselves at a table to wait for the server. This might be a random observation, but I really appreciated the size of the tables for two. They could have probably fit four people but with only two seats it felt like there was actually enough room for plates and drinks and such. One of my biggest annoyances with eating at bars is getting an extraordinarily small, wobbly table. Our waitress came over pretty quickly and provided us with the draft list and specials for the night. The beer choices weren't amazing but certainly adequate for a neighborhood place. I ended up ordering the California chicken wrap with regular fries, and my boyfriend got chicken fingers with waffle fries. I absolutely loved my wrap and fully intend to order it again! It had guacamole, (an all too rare thing to find in wraps or sandwiches in Pittsburgh) bacon, general chunks of grilled chicken, and tomatoes. Those are four of my favorite foods, so I was very pleased with my choice. I eat my wraps with a knife and fork so I had no trouble with the messiness factor, but the wrap was quite large and I had leftovers for the following day. I enjoyed my boyfriend's waffle fries a little more than my plain ones however, so I'll probably get those next time. He said his chicken fingers were great. I'm sure we'll be back at Silky's very soon. Delicious food, awesome service, and close proximity to our home will make this a regular spot for the two of us.",
