    "text": "Met friends here to catch up.  Was quickly seated on a weeknight.  Parked in the local garage, which was a 1/2 block away.  Immediately asked about drinks, then left alone for a very long time.  When the rest of my party arrived, we ordered. I had the half-off (happy hour) jalapeno popper dip with pita and chips.  The dip was good (jalapenos, cream cheese, breading topping), but very salty (and I love salt), as where the chips.  I couldn't finish it because of that, and probably downed about 2-3 glasses of water. I ordered a chicken sandwich with bacon, cheese, and apple (I can't recall the name).  My chicken was cold and a bit pink in the middle. I pulled it off and ate the rest, which was also super salty from the bacon. I did enjoy the sweet potato tots, which were crisp on the outside and hot on the inside. After 2 more glasses of water from the bacon saltiness, I had to find the restrooms.  The bathrooms were upstairs, and we had to weave between tightly packed people both downstairs and upstairs to get there.  All-in-all, this place was OK, I'd be willing to visit again, as I spent about $20 total for my over-salted food.",

I love sitting outside during spring, summer, or fall. It's quite lovely to be close to the hustle and bustle of Shadyside, but not too close.",

    "text": "You had me at tater tots, but then you had to one up that and make them out of sweet potatoes.  I think I may love you now.  You have filled a void I didn't even know I had.  We arrived during a lunch time rush but were seated immediately and we didn't have to wait a minute for the waitress to come over.  With our drink orders placed we decided to read over the menu and then make our selections.  We started with the Shady Sticks and were happy with those.  All they are is a pizza with the sauce on the side for dipping.  I mean it's like a medium sized pizza, so a very good portion and the dough was so sweet and mixed with the three types of cheese on it was great.  For my main course I opted for the California BLT.  When I ordered this I was assuming that it was going to be run of the mill, thrown together BLT.  Was I ever surprised.  Multigrain bread topped with applewood bacon, crispy lettuce and thickly sliced tomatoes.  I was most surprised by the tomatoes, I was expecting uniformly cut and small.  What I got was like someone took a tomato from a basket, cut it quickly and didn't care how it looked, I approve!  Now, back to those tater tots!  I am completely infatuated with them.  They were crunchy and puffy and so delightful.  Just the right size to pop in your mouth and munch away.  Their side of Cajun ranch is an amazing compliment.  I was as near to heaven as I could be with those, no joke.  I also opted for the blackberry mojito.  Best way to describe it is by saying it was bittersweet.  The mint played off of the blackberry and it played well.  Seating was nice, at a high table, we were at the corner that we could not only people watch inside the restaurant, but we could also people watch on the sidewalk.  Televisions on, music blaring, people singing, it was a great atmosphere.",

I've had the Shady Grove Burger about 5 times. Quality is a bit inconsistent (can be overcooked sometimes) but is still delicious. Also this place has the best fries I have ever had - crispy outside and soft inside. Only once were the fries done badly (fried in old oil). Wednesday wine night is also fun and has great music! A lot of 90s hip hop. It does get very loud in the upstairs area, so don't expect to have any intimate conversations. They do get busy, so be prepared to wait a bit. Also, skip the tacos, blech. :P",

    "text": "Shady Grove is anything but a shady spot in Shadyside. On my recent visit to Pittsburgh, I found it actually to be a pretty decent bar and restaurant.  All weekend long my group attempted to make it to Shady Grove for a bit to eat. We got in too late the first night, the kitchen closed too early on Saturday, but finally we were able to get our fix on Sunday for lunch.  It was kind of perfect actually since they had their Sunday mimosa special. It was $3 for a regular mimosa, applemosa or cranmosa. We also snagged a table outside so got to enjoy some sunshine.   The second I looked at the menu, I knew I had to try the Goat Pizza. Of course I had to get in on the mimosa deal as well. I had one regular and one applemosa. I enjoyed the apple and champagne however think I might be a standard orange juice mimosa type of gal.   Although I'm from out of town and this was my first visit to Shady Grove, the Goat Pizza must have been designed with me in mind. It was made up of some of my favorite ingredients: roasted garlic oil, goat cheese, bacon and roasted red peppers. If it included pesto, I may have died of happiness. In any case it sounded a little better on paper. The goat cheese came out as crumbles versus a spread. The menu didn't specify but my dream pizza would have had a creamier goat cheese. I was also expecting the garlic to be a little more prominent on the pie. Don't get me wrong, it was still extremely enjoyable, but I'm just a little picky when it comes to my goat cheese dishes.   I also got to sample my friend's pierogie pizza which I thought was pretty neat conceptually. I envisioned a regular pizza topped with pierogies however the pizza was topped with the ingredients of a cheddar, onion and bacon pierogie. It was a starch overload but absolutely tasty. My husband went with the jerk grilled chicken fingers. While I didn't try the chicken, the jalapeno mango sauce and cilantro serrano sauce were perfect for dunking my pizza crust. I also got to try a few of my friend's sweet potato tots. I could have easily housed them if he hadn't almost done so already.   While I love to dine al fresco, Shady Grove is located on a fairly trafficked street off of Walnut. Unfortunately, one street at the intersection wasn't paved well so dirt kept flying up at us when cars drove by. That probably could be avoided by sitting closer to Walnut Street or by sitting inside.   Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. One of my friends asked what her favorite menu item was and she was able to naturally rattle off a few things she likes and what scenario she usually eats them. It's always a plus when a server enjoys the food from their restaurant and can easily talk to the menu.   So aside from desire for goat cheese perfection and a little flying dirt, Shady Grove made for a pretty good lunch.",

I am more of a beer drinker myself but the man who tends bar is top notch; I would argue he is the best bartender in Shadyside. He makes fantastic drinks and is always doing cool bar tricks.   I'm not a huge fan of the menu and to be honest I only ever eat here on burger night because its such a great deal. The service is very hit or miss depending on who's waiting tables.   As for the weekends, Shady \"Groove\" is the spot to get your dance on. Go upstairs on a Saturday night and you'll find a bunch of people dancing in a judgement free zone. There's always good music bumping and the crowd is usually pretty tame, it's a great environment!   If you go next door to Mario's, you will soon find that many of the loyal patrons mistake the bar for fight-club. Stay safe, avoid drama, and check out Shady Grove for a fun night out.",

Highly recommend the sweet potato tater tots, or the pizza because the dough is fairly unique. Salads are also a favorite, and they have good specials! I believe Wednesday is half priced bottles of wine. There is something for everyone on their extensive menu, and it's also good for a date night. American food with a twist. I will be back again for sure!",

That being said, it's probably not the best place to come for a first date or to hold a meeting over a meal because it can get pretty loud. We didn't want to wait for a table, so we opted for the bar instead.   We got the guacamole deviled eggs as our appetizer and the Shady burger. The deviled eggs came with bacon pieces and tomatoes so it's not just fully guac which was a good thing. The burger was fine, just like any other decent burger. I wasn't a fan of the fries it came with. If you prefer thin fries instead of the thick ones, you might not enjoy the huge portion of fries they serve.   Overall, friendly staff, good food, and interesting promos every day. Shady grove is a decent choice if you're looking for traditional American food.",

The menu offers lots of different options from appetizers, fresh salads, and mouth watering sandwiches and wraps all for an affordable price. (I highly recommend trying the Harvest Chicken or the Pierogi Sandwich for first timers.) I'm currently working on trying everything on the menu once, and so far no dish has disappointed me. From a friendly owner, great service, fun daily specials, and an amazing wine night every Wednesday (1/2 off bottles of wine until midnight) complete with an upbeat DJ upstairs, Shady Grove has become a regular visit for me and my friends.  Keep it up Shady Grove!",

If Shady Grove is the best that  Walnut Street has to offer as far as drinking and dining, then it's no wonder that Shadyside needs a boost of steroids.  Perhaps, Barry shouldn't have been so quick to leave the Burgh or he should have left some of his good stuff behind.  My friend and I decided to order some of their artisan pizzas, and the Margharita and the Pesto were our choices.  The  honey wheat dough tasted like it came directly from the nearest Taco Bell caramel apple empenada assembly line.  The mutilated tomato bits strewn across each of the pizzas also must have come from a Taco Bell assembly line. Most of the items that should have been on the pizza were MIA.

Next, I sat there for a good 5 minutes which felt like 10, and had to ask a bartender for a menu to even get any sort of service. Anywho, the bartender wasn't too thrilled to serve me for whatever reason. For my first visit I'd rate customer service a solid 1 star.  Next, the food. I ordered my food which was not good at all. I had a half cooked buffalo chicken pizza. It was not thoroughly cooked at all. My stomach was in utter pain after consuming one slice! The dough was not thoroughly cooked and nor was the cheese. I wasn't impressed. I will not return here. I only recommend this place for a quick fast food option or somewhere to go on a drunk Saturday night.. nothing else!",

When the weather is nice, we've enjoyed a few nights out there drinking a half priced bottle of wine on Wednesdays.   We recently went to watch a football game inside and it was enjoyable because it wasn't crowded at all and we got a high top table in the corner where we could hang out and talk for a few hours. The inside is not very big and the bar goes down the middle of the restaurant. The food is okay, however we never think to go there for dinner when we are considering options. They do have a pretty large menu and this past time we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, and nachos and liked both.   I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a laid back place and some straight forward American food.",

Very good chili on them.   My wife ordered the BBQ chicken pizza which she loved, I tried a small bite as I don't like onions but it was good- the crust is sweet, it has a distinct taste to it.   I ordered the Shady Steak in wrap form and was blown away. It comes with potato latkes, egg, and garlic aioli and it was phenomenal, highly recommend.   Service was really good as well. Aside from being a little crammed in and having to go upstairs for the bathroom, this place is a must visit",

    "text": "We stopped in this evening for a light snack and a few drinks after a show at the University of Pittsburgh.  All was fine until a girl at the bar left her purse when she left and my friend tried to run out and stop her.  I followed him out to see if I could help and was holding the door open for a moment that lead outside.  Once I realized that he may have reached her or attempted to keep looked I turned around to go back in and the \"Bouncer\" who was sitting near the main door to the restaurant screams at me to close the door because he was cold and rolls his eyes at me. So I turned to him and said \"I'm sorry but we live in PA so learn to deal with the cold and as a paying customer maybe you can back off.\" And I made my way back up to the bar.  When I told the bartenders of the attitude and what he said they laughed.  At that point I was done and was actually thinking of refusing to pay my bill or tip.  Then some slutty waitress was wearing a shirt that was showing the majority of her braw and unflattering side boob.  Overall, stay away unless you want some average food, ignorant staff to deal with and a bouncer who should never be the first impression of any business to treat you like garbage",

    "text": "I have never felt the desire to try Shady Grove based on the reviews, but I ended up coming here last week.  Apparently, Wednesday nights are half price wine bottle nights, but I just wanted food.  The happy hour chicken nachos ($6) were a good start for a group of four.  The portion was large and the nachos were pretty loaded.  However, I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap ($10).  I didn't enjoy it, as it was mostly just drenched in hot sauce.  I took half of it home and threw the untouched wrap away a week later.  My friends were equally unimpressed with the quality and the price.  I really have no desire to come back here, but I would at least consider ordering appetizers off of the happy hour menu.  Service was mediocre.  Otherwise, fairly unimpressed.",

There were loads of veggies and I especially liked the grilled portobella mushrooms. I thought the balsamic dressing made it a winning combo.

That's the best way I can explain it. I got the chicken Caesar wrap when I went (with fries, duh) and it was such a large portion and so delicious! I've been dying to stop here for brunch, or just really any other time, but I'm not super close by. Again, I've been here one time, but I can't stop thinking about how good it was!",

It was a Friday night and we had to wait about 30 minutes to get seated, which was fine with us since we were able to find seats at the bar while we waited! It was very busy but the bartender served us right away. I started with a cosmo, which was great! My other 2 friends had dirty martinis and they said theirs were great as well.   We were seated after about 30-40 minutes of waiting and we had a great table for the 6 of us! Our waitress was nice but you could tell she was very busy and rushing around. We started with the hummus, I order every time I go! They give a lot of hummus compared to the pita they give you, so we always ask for extra pita. For my entree I got the summer salad which is one of my favorites! It has shrimp, goat cheese, mango salsa, and sunflower seeds. Others around the table got ahi tuna, Cobb salad, and wraps. Shady Grove is a great place to visit while in Shady Side for a meal that will always be yummy!",

    "text": "I stopped here for some drinks for a friend's going away celebration. I didn't order food so this review is only for the bar service. If you're a rookie like I was, the address indicates that it's on Walnut but the entrance is actually on a street off of Walnut. Bellefonte Street to be exact. And when you enter the first door, you have two options: go through the door immediately to the right or go upstairs to the left. Apparently the upstairs bar becomes quite the party with a live DJ on the weekends.   My large party celebrated in the upstairs bar. You can also get food upstairs but note that the kitchen closes at 10 pm. Shady Grove does not take dinner reservations so our large group was scattered at different tables, as there weren't enough tables to fill us all. I opted to sit at the bar and got to see and hear the wait staff and bartenders interacting with each other. I can understand the frustrations of serving such a huge group, but I didn't really appreciate the permanent scowls on the employees' faces. I also didn't quite appreciate the tone they used when talking about our party to each other. Maybe they forgot I wasn't a part of that party but these kinds of conversations shouldn't be held in front of any customer.   All in all, I wasn't a huge fan. The service kind of turned me off from anything else it might have going for itself. It's unlikely I'll come back for drinks and possibly never for the food either.",

Most places are stingy with the side salads, so I wasn't expecting much, but the waitress brought me a plate where the lettuce was practically overtaking the already large burger. Needless to say, it was a wise substitution. Even better, we went during happy hour (Monday's 5-10) so burgers were half off. For all you broke college kids, that's $5 a burger.   On the downside, they must compensate for happy hour by staffing the least charming waitresses on Monday nights. The girl serving us did everything right, but it was clear she was doing it out of obligation. I don't know if this bothers everyone, but it made dinner a little uncomfortable.",

I especially loved the fresh jalapenos on the nachos and the convenience of the separate side cups of pico de gallo, sour cream and guacamole. The waitress was attentive and the noise level wasn't too bad. Unfortunately, my mojito was disappointing - very weak and fairly tasteless.   Shady Grove is a good choice for a casual night out at a decent price. I'll be back to test out wine night - you can never go wrong with half price bottles (Wednesday and Friday).",

I don't remember what it was supposed to be (they don't have a drink menu on the website; otherwise I could probably figure it out), but I remember it just tasted off, to the point that I couldn't finish it (and that *never* happens with me with cocktails).  My friends both tasted it and agreed.  Service was on the slow side, but then again, it was happy hour, and they were understaffed.  It seemed like a fun spot to have a few drinks after work--the crowd seemed to be mostly young professionals--and they have a decent variety of food to choose from.

I've had mixed experiences with the service at the bar though. The doorman is a really great guy, and over my multiple trips had a very friendly acquaintance with him. Upstairs though, depending on the bartender, I've sometimes had the feeling of being deliberately ignored, while someone else just cleans the glasses. This is not the case always by any means, but it left me with a bad impression for some time. Its never happened downstairs though, and typically most of the staff is OK.

The beer selection is standard with a few craft beers on tap but mostly just your average Yuengling, Blue Moon and the sorts is what people go for.",

I actually liked it so much that I've recreated it at home and now it's part of my regular cooking rotation. They also serve it in a giant mixing bowl which I thought was odd at first but in the end it just means you get a lot more salad than your average serving! I also got some sweet potato tatter tots which were tasty as well.  It took us some time to get a table (party of 4) since the place is kind of small and the food is not cheap (around $13-15 a dish) but it's definitely worth it every once in a while!",

We were seated quickly downstairs (it does get very busy on Friday and Saturday nights) and our friendly waitress took our drink order. They typically have a nice draft list and I went with my favorite the Leinie cranberry/ginger. The menu had so many great options from salads to wraps and burgers.  The salad options were so impressive and I went with the Greek salad which was served in a huge salad bowl. The dressing was delicious- what I liked is the dressing was not too oily and came with olives, feta cheese, cucumbers, onions and banana peppers.  Lot of fresh ingredients with a great taste.  My friend went with one of the wraps and I really like how you have an option of a few sides instead of getting fries.",

The service is totally average, I've never had any negative experience though. I love that they have a big menu, yet I've never ordered something that I didn't LOVE. In terms of American restaurants, Shady Grove is my ideal. I don't frequently get drinks here for two reasons: moreso because the food is so filling I can't have more than water, but also because the prices aren't that great. However, they do have some nice food and drink specials if you plan ahead to come on a night with your special of choice. I love the half priced burger night, it's amazing to get a really solid burger (and delicious fries) for 7 or 8 dollars. If you are hesitant from the reviews, I recommend you give Shady Grove a try before you overlook them!",

We only had to wait for a few minutes to be seated.  A table opened up outside.  Our server \"Liz\" was on it.. she was on top of our cocktails and food.  For appetizers we had Cajun rub wings:  which were good cooked well done as I like it.. but tasted like seasoned salt and paprika or chili powder..  there wasn't much to the cajun flavoring..  - was \"ok\".  I had wished  I had tried the hot.. wondered how that flavor was.   Mango Salsa:  how refreshing and flavorful!  Choice of pita/chips or both.. we decided to live on the edge and chose both!!   I really liked the menu.  There was something for everyone..  and especially liked the added \"sunny side up - egg\" options on some of the dishes.  I had a tough time deciding .. there was plenty of options of sandwiches/wraps and even pizza.  I decided on the \"steakhouse burger\" and it was A M A Z I N G .. definitely one of the best burgers that I have had in the burg:  angus burger, smoked gouda, sauteed spinach, onion straws, bacon, lettuce and tomato $11.00 - definitely worth it.    Parking was tough but with some patience we managed to find a spot in the public parking lots a street behind walnut.    Thanks Shady Grove!",

The food and the service has always been excellent. I have never had a bad experience dining at Shady Grove. It is also a great place for a Sunday Brunch. I love the salads. My favorite is the Chicken Ceaser. I also like the Ahi Tuna. You can't beat a $3 Mimosa on a Sunday.  They offer a small wine list, but I have enjoy a few glasses. I really like the 1/2 price wine Weds. They don't take reservations, but it does fill up quickly on a good day. Highly Recommend.",

The food is decently healthy; my second trip was with a friend with a specific diet so she won't get sick and it was such a great option - and the price is just perfect! I got a wrap with fries and she got a wrap with a salad.  I'm not a super fan of the fries because they are a tad greasy (but if you like your fries that way, then this is the place!), I think next time I'll go for a salad instead.  My dad ordered the Cobb Salad and enjoyed it - it was a very large portion.  Both times I ate here, I walked away with extra food for another day's meal.  Heating it up didn't ruin it either.  I went with the General Tso's Chicken and Pesto Chicken - I'd recommend both!  Only negative was I felt I had to yell a lot to talk to my friend when we were seated close to the bar.",

We ordered the onion rings as an appetizer. First the portions were generous but more importantly they were perfectly cooked and battered. (I hate when the onion falls out because of a lack of batter or sogginess due to a bad mix)    If you like sweet potatoes, make sure you get the sweet potato tots as a side.  They went great with my pesto burger (which was also great).  Overall it was worth the lunch time wait.  I will definitely go back when I am in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "This place is consistently a solid 3 out of 5. That's more than most places can claim.  When it's crowded it's a 2 out of 5, because the bar is shaped a little strange since it gives the bartenders more room than the customers. The mixed drinks are a 4 out of 5 most of the time, depending on your bartender. The bar looks cool inside, and the location is right in the middle of Shadyside.  It's very close to the garage, so parking is easy if you can't find a street spot. The service is usually pretty good, except when it's really busy, which is understandable. This is a consistently good happy hour place that's close to home if you live in or around Shadyside. It is what it is, and it's pretty good at it most of the time.  In the summer when they set up the outside tables, this is one of the best places to hang out on Walnut as long as its not too crowded.   Also - try the Ahi tuna appetizer, the Turkey Pesto Wrap, and the pizza after you've had a few.",

If I return, I'll definitely go for the classic fried finger food. Had a few beers, each on draft for $1.42.. Awesome! The crowd filtered in for happy hour, and it was the most packed around 6. Overall, I'd do it again. Perhaps for a more formal seating in the upstairs restaurant, Walnut Grill. It seems to operate from the same kitchen and under the same management...  Since the great drink prices resonate as most memorable, I've added it to my \"Party in the 'Burgh\" list.",

    "text": "You know it's going to be a long week when it's Monday night and already you are too lazy to cook.  Luckily, I've got this sweet new gig that allows me to justify going out to dinner pretty much whenever I please (and can afford it)!   On this creepy fall evening, I decided to head to Walnut Street in Shadyside.  We wanted some \"low-key\" good, ol' American food.  We headed to Shady Grove.  Shady Grove is actually the downstairs sibling of the Walnut Grill/Shady Grove pair, and I gotta say, they definitely got the \"grove\" thing down pat.  The dining room is a long, narrow space with sparse lighting.  There were about 6 lights in the dining area, and in fact, I think most of the light in the room came either from the large garage door windows or the large  TVs hanging above the bar.  The dim lighting was actually pretty annoying; I like to SEE what I'm eating- too grove-y for me.  Looking around, I noticed that the diners were mostly twenty-something kids, on dates or in groups. There were a few ...um...mature adults enjoying wine with dinner in the back of the room.  I have a tendency to notice the background music at restaurants.  No doubt about it, music plays a big part in setting the \"vibe\" of the place.  I suppose that's why I was a little bit confused when the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air theme- song came on; really, Shady Grove...the Fresh Prince song??  I mean, sure I loved that show when I was eleven, but in 2009?  At dinner?!  I wanted to throw that song out the front door like Uncle Phil did to Jazzy Jeff.  The bar boasted a couple of specials that night: half-priced margaritas and half-priced draft beers.  I noticed that the Martini list wasn't much of a martini list at all, but really just a list of various Three Olives brand flavored vodkas mixed with pomegranate juice...not very inventive.  My roommate and I started with classic margaritas, but they were AWFUL, nothing more than terrible sweet & sour mix & ice.   The waitress was pretty cool about us sending those drinks back, and we ordered new libations.  Brianna (the roommate) ordered something called a \"Posmo,\" and said it was \"much better\" than the margarita.  (I think that's a cosmopolitan with pomegranate juice instead of cranberry.  Fun!)  My pal Emily enjoyed her \"Pomenade.\"  I just had a Yuengling draft, as I wasn't in the mood for a pomegranate drink and the bar was out of the other beer I tried to order (Southern Tier Brewing Company's Pumking...Mmm).  In Shady Grove's defense, it is the end of the fall beer season, so I guess I can understand running out.  In fact, Shady Grove was out of several menu items that night, and I was pretty annoyed that the waitress didn't tell us that up front.  I was looking forward to trying something called the Eggplant Tower; it was listed as a \"Shady Signature\" dish.  Too bad...they were out of eggplant.  No beer.  No eggplant.   I know it was just bad timing, but sheesh!  Eventually, we had a nice heap of grilled chicken nachos sitting on our table.   The nachos were actually a great size for three hungry ladies to share.  I was happy to see an abundance of jalapenos (that way we didn't have to ration peppers; we all love hot food!)  Unfortunately, the rest of the dinner didn't quite live up to the prelude.  We shared a veggie white pizza, and we agreed that it was actually pretty gross.  There was no taste in the crust, there was no taste to the sauce (if it even had sauce on it), and the veggies did not mesh together well.  We should have skipped the pizza altogether.  I will say that I had intense food envy when the table next to ours was given a huge platter of hot wings.  I love hot wings...why didn't I just get the hot wings?  Stupid trendy menu.  Stupid vegetables.  I get the impression that this is a bar that specializes in bar food.  I appreciate that Shady Grove is trying to spice things up with some adventurous drinks and dishes (what the heck is guapo, anyway?).  Unfortunately, it got away from them somewhere, and the special dishes have turned in to a waste of money.  This is a neighborhood hang-out.  Big aspirations are great, but in the end, Shady Grove is just like any other bar: kids in hoodies, eating wings & watching Sportscenter.  So...did I mention that I love hot wings?  I'd like to do a Best of Pittsburgh Hot Wings feature.  Sometime soon, I will head back to Shady Grove to try out their beautiful buffalo wings.  If you have any suggestions for restaurants with awesome hot wings, let me know!  I'd love to find the best wings in the 'burgh!  I ain't chicken!

Last time we went there the waitress ignored our table for almost an hour.  All of the other tables around our were served a number of times, and had their drinks refilled constantly.  Our drinks (non-alcoholic) were never refilled, and my my boyfriend complained by simply saying that this is bull-**** we were asked to leave.  When I complained on Facebook the complaint was deleted, twice.  When I complained in email it was ignored.  Typically we are pretty big tippers, so I have no idea what the waitresses issue would have been, but we will NEVER go back to their restaurants, including the Walnut Grill, Walnut Grove, and Up.",

I originally went to order one of their \"taters\" - a loaded baked potato and the server told me, sorry we don't have them and that we are in the process of changing the menu.  Thanks...then I waited 25 minutes for her to bring my second choice.  The BBQ chicken wrap was okay as far as nourishment is concerned.  I wouldn't go back.  It looks like a cute cafe from the outside but its clear this place is a bar, serving bar food with bar service and bar atmosphere.",

The service is consistent, and they have great salads/pizza/sandwiches, and super yummy fries! Somehow I ended up here 3 times last week (twice for lunch and once for happy hour), so I got a chance to try each of my favorites. My favorites are the Greek salad, BBQ chicken pizza, the Hawaiian pizza, and this week's discovery - the Hot Veggie sandwich.  Really, you can't go wrong with any of the pizzas though. The crust has a sweet flavor to it that really sets it apart from any other pizza in the area. Just thinking about it is making my mouth water...",

Only observation, raised by another Yelper, was the smell of the trash bin on the far right side of the patio.  Only blessing, it is not hot or humid today.

The decor is really nice and posh...it kind of makes you want to put on a collared shirt.  The food is also decent, though not spectacular.  Definitely a nice lunch stopover though.   The problem with the bar is the crowd at night.  I mean it is CROWDED.  It's next to impossible to get a drink at the bar or from the wait staff, who are really trying their best but are just overwhelmed with people!   Drinks are made ok...I wasn't overly impressed.  I want to like the bar more, but the crowds keep annoying me to the point of wanting to leave.  Also, the bar is really packed with the douchiest people in Shadyside as well, so not only are you crowded into oblivion, but also it's like a Jersey Shore episode in there...not fun.    Overall, it's not a bad place.  The drinks and such are done ok, bue the crowd is just overwhelming at all times.  I'd go elsewhere if given the option.",

    "text": "I'm reviewing this place as a bar, that sometimes I eat at.  Rather than a restaurant, that I happen to have some drinks at....  Using this lens - this place is pretty good.  Specifically - the pizza is very good.  Shady sticks as an appetizer - also great.  (think pokey sticks if you went to penn state and ever ordered from Gumby's)  I was there again this past Sunday and had a Greek salad.  It exceeded my expectations.  I've been many times over the past year, and I believe they've made some improvements to their salad options.  I was pleased!    I haven't had the burgers or sandwiches lately, so won't comment on their flavor - but their menu is extensive - so there are many many options.  (Again, compared to a BAR - not another restaurant)  Wednesday night is wine night - half off bottles of wine.  Which is a wonderful headache inducing special.    The place is usually packed after 7pm - every night.  Little room to move, no seats, etc.  And yes - there are a fare number of Ed Hardy and Affliction shirts.  I'm only giving this a 3 star, because the atmosphere and service drive me nuts sometimes.  Food and drinks alone, would warrant a better review.  If you're not interested in the mayhem...try them out for a weekend lunch.  A great stop if doing some Walnut Street shopping.",

It going to be an interesting night, anyway you look at it.    So there are two parts to the this place, the downstairs bar and seating area.  If this area just seems to packed to find somewhere to sit, move along to the back and find the stairs that head up to the second bar area upstairs.  I spent most of my time upstairs where there was a jukebox blasting top 40's and hip hop.  The bartender actually made me put more money into the jukebox when the music stopped saying she was not going to serve until there were beats.  Well after some bar food and beers, the night was under way.  And the place stayed packed until closing.  Summary- $2 Dos Equis on Thursdays you have got to be kidding me!",

    "text": "Let me begin this by saying that the reason they are getting this rating is for lack of consistency.  I was a shadyside resident for quite sometime and spent many afternoons and evenings in Shady Grove and Walnut Grill. Shady Grove has been the less consistent of the two for me over the years. For New Years Eve this year, my friends made dinner reservations for us at Walnut Grill and then we went downstairs for drinks and to ring in 2012. This review is only about Shady Grove, as my experiences at Walnut Grill have been pretty good.   Shady grove food is good and the drinks are reasonably priced. The space is cool and in the summer they have outdoor seating, which I love. Wine nights on Wednesdays cannot be beat-half priced bottles all evening. The reason for the 3 rating? The service is SO inconsistent. I've had visits where my service is appalling, and then visits where my service is grand. When I say appalling, I mean a waitress poured water on my feet and all over the floor, and told me not to slip when I left, rather than giving me a towel to dry my freezing toes. And even on NYE, the service was very inconsistent. One bartender would be great. Another would be just awful-horrible attitude, ignoring sections of the bar, etc. It is really a shame. It seems like certain employees (in particular a broad fellow with dark hair-not wearing the uniform...perhaps a manager?) are there just to meet girls and act like a hot shot. He was behind the bar, not serving anyone, as if to give the impression that he owns the place (which I know he does not), and was hitting on a girl in my group HARD. He was just trying to look like a big shot. Annoying. Make a drink for the people waiting and stop trying to hook up with uninterested women. Thanks.   That being said, it is usually a cool crowd there. Great location. Usually I have no trouble finding parking. So all in all...Good food. Good Vibe. Good  drinks. Some great servers. Some crabby servers. Big guy with the dark hair? Try to get laid on your own time.  Happy New Year!",

    "text": "Although some others have listed Shady Grove as a bit mediocre I believe it is a pretty cool place.  Atmosphere: There are lots of big screen tvs and usually plenty of seating if you don't go during happy hour or high noon you should be okay.  I've eaten their with my folks during the day and the service has been quite fast.  I've also eaten with a large group of friends during a hockey game which took a bit longer but still was expected with a large group.  The late night scene is enjoyable.  Lots of college and graduate students and a large batch of 25yr+ people.  There is an open bar and drinks are fairly large.  Shots are quite large, coke and rums are good.  I am not sure if there is a special drink offered but I've always enjoyed myself there at night no matter what I drink.  Staff: The staff is pretty prompt.  It is quite a large place so sometimes if you are with a larger group you have to expect it to take a bit longer.  Sometimes I've been a bit surprised at how fast the food has come out though so you never know.  Food: I think that the food here is good.  I would put some of the dishes on the same level as Cappy's down the street but others are outstanding.  I've had salads, quesadillas, burgers, wings, chicken finger platters, etc.  They have a great selection so if you are wish a group of people who are in the mood for a wide variety of foods it is definitely the place to go!",

However, this is not the case with their provolone wedges.  $6 for 3 pieces, seriously??  A huge ripoff.  I had the Shady Burger which is an angus burger with a sunny side up egg in it.  It was ok but for some reason the American cheese in it really got to me.  It was difficult for me to finish the burger because it also reminded me of ordinary-to-bad backyard grilling that my dad used to do.  I ordered a medium burger but it was essentially well-done, with some burn.  I'm also not a huge fan of sunny side up eggs (but my being a fan of eggs overpowered this so I still ordered the Shady burger) and with good reason -- dribbleeee.  It was a mess.  I loved the super crispy french fries though.    Service was decent.  Atmosphere is decent.  It was nice to be able to sit outside.",

Our waitress was attentive and people seemed to be enjoying themselves.  I ordered the Jerk Mahi Mahi on Kaiser and my fiancee ordered the Caprese Sandwich.  This is where things started to fall apart.   My sandwich came on a hamburger bun, not a Kaiser roll and the fish was mediocre to decent, nothing to write home about, but the jerk rub was not nearly as spicy as a jerk rub should be.  On the menu the Caprese Sandwich is vegetarian and says \"Add chicken $3.\"  The sandwich came with chicken which we did not order, when we asked the waitress she said that it automatically comes with chicken (and therefore also comes automatically for $11 instead of $8), if we didn't want chicken we had to ask to have the sandwich come as it says it does on the menu.  If it automatically comes with chicken, then say that on the menu and charge $11, otherwise, only give us chicken if we ask. The fries which accompanied our sandwiches were also decent but not great, so in the end, the food was a little on the pricey side for the quality and, more importantly, not consistent with the menu from which we ordered.  All in all, a disappointment.",

I ordered the Turkey burger with my friend having the Bacon Swiss. Both burgers were cooked well, flavorful, and of good size. The menu itself was huge, with my friend reporting that she has tried several items and being satisfied with all of them. Plenty to choose from and something for everyone! The drink menu looked quite diverse as well.  The restaurant itself was clean with an upscale twist for being an older-looking bar. Definitely would stop back for any of their deal nights!",

The prices are also very reasonable and they have different specials each day. 100% recommend this place. Ask for Chloe!",

The waitresses and hostesses were super accommodating and chill with both of the large groups I was apart of. Looking for a good bite to eat, affordable drinks, and cool scenery?

The uber driver mistakenly grabbed our food after telling the host he did not think it was ours only to deliver it and we check to see that it isn't our order. When I called to speak to the manager he couldn't have been more unprofessional and only argued that he could not refund my 35$. So not only did we not get any food we also were told it was fine that we were not satisfied. He could not have been more rude or lack of understanding. I will not be wasting my money here! Avoid if possible!!!",

I ordered a side Caesar salad, gives me iceberg but doesn't mention they are out of romaine. Never came back to ask if everything was good, as a server for over years years this is so unacceptable.

They were nice and tangy and tasted great with the horseradish sauce. For dinner, I had the southern fried chicken sandwich. The sandwich was huge. I was disappointed that it was not one chicken breast or patty but rather four chicken tenders. This made the sandwich quite difficult to eat. Tenders just kept falling out. The hot sauce was good and added nice flavor, but I ended up just eating some of the tenders on their own. I had ordered waffle fries, but it came with fries. The fries were fine. I could not even finish them, because the food just felt very greasy. My friends had the veggie burger and enjoyed it, but their patties kept falling apart too. Overall, Shady Grove is hit or miss with their dishes.",

The wait for our food was much longer than expected, but our service was excellent. The food itself was pretty good. The portion of my salad was HUGE, which I was really impressed by. Everything tasted really fresh as well. Brendan's sandwich was good, but nothing to write home about. Overall, we had a nice meal, but I do think it's a little overpriced here.

However, I find the music unpleasantly too loud. I understand if you go at night and want somewhat of a night club ambiance but during the day, the music is blaring and it's hard to have a conversation. So I might be tempted to go for the food but I will reconsider in the future because of the obnoxiously loud music. You can always sit outside where it is quiet but you are out of luck if it's full or cold.",

So we tried to order waffle fries, which were out... this restaurant is known for those aren't they?! And then there weren't any tortillas because we had tried to order chicken nachos for the table. Oh and then they didn't have PINEAPPLES for our pineapple pizza? Uh... and then no pierogis for the pierogi pizza..   Sighhhh.... well onto the food, when my friends' burgers came out, the smell was mouthwatering! And the fries were crispy! If I come again, I'd probably get the shady burger. I ordered the barbecue chicken pizza. It wasn't too sweet! I liked it. We had also ordered the shroom pizza, way too cheesy for my taste, but it also had 3 different cheeses. They were both $12 for small pizzas, but there were like 6 slices and I had only finished half.   As for service, our waitress Olivia, was really nice.  However she didn't refill our waters.... only once. And the service was quite slow. We spent two hours here.  Debating on returning again, maybe for the bar instead?",

The Chicken Florentine was definitely the better of the two, though honestly I have not had a caprese as a sandwich that I like anywhere.  My favorite thing about this place is the $2 Mexican beers and $4 tequila shots. The tequila shots are for any tequila of your choice! Last time we were there my boyfriend and I threw back a couple of Patron Silvers. We only stopped because we had to go shopping for house stuff (being an adult sucks sometimes!). I usually go with Dos Equis, either the Lager or Amber, as my drink of choice. Can't beat tasty $2 beers.",

The spinach and artichoke dip we shared to start was delicious. Big pieces of artichoke and soft pita. I had the BBQ chicken salad. This salad was huge and pretty good. Lots of chicken, BBQ sauce, fried onions, and cheese over a huge bowl of iceberg lettuce. I'll be back. It was the prefect stop after a particularly bad day.",

    "text": "Decided to meet up with two friends here on Tuesday. We met at 6pm, which was perfect since it wasn't too busy yet (filled up by 7:30pm). We quickly had a table (opted for inside) and caught the second half of happy hour (5-7pm), which offered half price cocktails ($9-11 usually) and selected glasses of wine for $4. My two female friends were big fans of their Bellinis and I stuck with a Whiskey Mojito which was decent.  We started off with an appetizer of their dipsticks, which are pizza dough with spinach artichoke dip on top with ranch sauce for dipping. My friend has gotten them before and raved about them, however I thought they were just OK. Tuesday also brings the taco specials for $2. Last night's taco choices were either chicken or beef (I believe it changes each week). I stuck with chicken, which I thought were really good. Once we passed happy hour, we went with the Tuesday specials of $2 Mexican beers (Corona, XX, Pacifico). There were also $4 tequila shots, but we weren't going down that road.  Overall, I thought we got away with a great value and had a great time (about $15 each before tip for 3 hours). Our server Alex was great and I would definitely go back again.",

    "text": "This place is consistently good. In particular, their sandwiches (on ciabatta) are to die for. I honestly find myself craving the food here from time to time. I've never had a bad menu item but there are some staples I tend to order repeatedly. The chicken club is excellent and my favorite part is that the chicken is a whole piece of grilled chicken. The sweet potato tots also come with a spicy ranch dipping sauce that is to die for and worth ordering for itself. They also always have excellent drink specials that rotate on a daily basis. I wouldn't consider them anything in special but the prices are good and they always have a beer or wine I'm interested in drinking.  There are a few things that prevent me from giving this place five stars. The inside gets really noisy which is to be expected, it's a bar in a younger part of the city, but some tables are notably louder than others. The wait list is always long and putting your name in ahead of time on the app is really hit or miss. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. The service is also hit or miss. As I mentioned - it's a busy place, but the last time I went I ordered a second beer as our dinner came out and it didn't arrive until my friend and I had finished. We aren't quick eaters and we're really enjoying our time together so this was annoying but also at the same, I sat there and finished the beer without complaint. Another time I was here and we ordered our sandwiches and they came out in wraps and not ciabatta and when I said something, we were told the restaurant had run out of ciabatta. No biggie, it's just something I wish would have been communicated earlier to me.   I will continue to go back here. They have a great outdoor seating area I love to enjoy dinner on.",

I was not a fan of the sauce but I was fine with eating the pickles plain. My salad was super good. They provided a generous amount of goat cheese which I did not complain about. I could have done without the dressing.  Will most likely be back when in the area shopping. Hopefully sooner than 10 years from now and hopefully on a champagne special night!",

They're kind of messy to eat - but SO worth it. My sister just got the Loaded Latkes for her meal. I tried one and they were pretty good!  The only reason I am taking a star away is because none of the food was served super hot. Everything that was supposed to be hot (friend pickles, shrimp, latkes) was lukewarm.",

    "text": "A cool modern restaurant with great food. I came here with a group of friends on a Saturday around 4:30 and they were able to sit us immediately. A waitress came over right away and took our drink orders as we waited for the rest of our group. After about 10 minutes, the waitress came over and informed us the upstairs was rented out for a private party at 6pm and asked if we wanted to move so we could have more time to enjoy our time together. She happily put our name on the list for a table downstairs, which is smaller and tough for a group of 5. But within 20 minutes the waitress came back and led us down to our new table.   We ordered the artichoke dip, which was incredible! It was fresh and the ingredients balanced each other out perfectly so the flavor was blended, rather than the cheese overpowering. The artichoke was also chopped in small pieces so you didn't just get a chunk when you dipped the pita bread in the dish. The dish was large enough for our group to enjoy too.  For an entree, I ordered the Spicy Jerk Chicken Sandwich. I asked for the Spicy sauce on the side and I'm glad I did, it had quite the heat and I was glad I could apply it myself. The chicken could have been a little bit more tender, but it was still seasoned nicely. They put a large amount of guac on it too, which was great to help with the spicy level. The fries that came on the side were fantastic. They were super crispy and fresh. Also, the dish was large enough to save half my sandwhich as leftovers.",

    "text": "I've been here twice in one week and I'd be willing to go back again soon. This is probably one of my favorite places in the city.   The first visit was on a Monday when they were having trivia. I ended up getting the Waldorf Salad w/ Maple Cider Vinaigrette - I was going to get the Balsamic but the server suggested the Maple Cider since it was made in house. So happy she suggested it! That dressing was everything and the salad was one of the best things I've eaten. I tried a few of the sweet potato tots that my cousin ordered and they were super good too! Not as delicious as the fries though, because those are on another level.  Since we won trivia, we got a $30 gift card and decided to come back during the weekend. I started off with the Adult Capri Sun which was pretty good - tastes like some tropical drink you'd find at a Caribbean resort.  We ordered the buffalo chicken dip which we've had before (boyfriend loves it). If you like your buffalo with a lot of heat, this probably won't satisfy that craving. It's super creamy with the lightest hint of buffalo. For those that don't like heat, this will probably be a great option for you. They don't give you a ton of pita though so while it's good, I suggest getting the chips.   For my entree, I ordered the Korean Fried Chicken Sandwich. It was good, but once again, I like more heat and this was lacking. I didn't feel like it had a ton of flavor but the ingredients were fresh and good quality. It just needed something. Like I said earlier, the fries are so good. They're battered and what French Fry dreams are made of.   When I come back, I'm absolutely going with a salad. I think it's what they do best and I can't wait to eat it again.",

I typically like eating on the top floor for the ambient lighting. It's great for conversation and the food is quite nice. For a restaurant and bar, Shady Grove does well for itself. The fries are some of my favorite, and they have a diverse drink selection! I absolutely recommend this place for a night out!",

    "text": "This is one of my new favorite places in Shadyside.  I have wanted to eat here for a long time and finally got the chance this past weekend.  I love the setup here with lots of indoor and outdoor seating.  Our server, Shidrokh was so nice and friendly.  She explained the best drink and food options for us.  For drinks my wife and I both tried the Adult Capri Suns.  I had the raspberry flavor and it was so good.  Great drink for a hot day.  My wife had the watermelon and liked hers as well.  On to the food.  Shady Grove has a lot of different options.  I wanted to try so many different things.  For an appetizer we had the buffalo chicken dip.  This was some of the best I have ever had.  While buffalo chicken dip is by no means a complicated dish, some places do it right and some places don't.  Theirs was a perfect amount of spice and sauce.  It also came with some really good grilled pitas.  For my meal I went with the Steak House Burger.  The burger was topped with sauteed spinach, bacon, onion straws, gouda cheese and a garlic aioli.  These toppings were very fresh and balanced out which made for a delicious flavor.  The beef itself was clearly fresh ground and had a great taste.  It was slightly over cooked for my medium rare request, however the burger was so juicy and flavorful it didn't really matter.  The burger came on a fresh brioche bun which held everything together.  The sandwiches and burgers come with waffle fries which were very crispy and had a great seasoning on them.  They also have some really good house made ranch which went perfect with the fries.  Can't wait to come back and try some of he other options on the menu.",

I always order the salads--particularly the southwest salad. It comes with tilapia which is always flaky and perfectly cooked. Don't switch the dressing - the one it comes with is a great paring. They don't skimp on the portion sizes either.  The pizzas are very good as well. The margarita pizza is the way to go, classic flavors. Or if you need an appetizer, try the shady sticks or guacamole deviled eggs.   The dishes aren't all perfection, though. Once I ordered the crab cake BLT. That dish was a bit disappointing: the crab cake was small and bland. I would have loved a flavorful sauce of some kind to amp it up.  So, some of the dishes are fantastic, while others may be lacking. That being said, I always enjoy my visits to Shady Grove.",

On this occasion, I was visiting my friend in Shady Side and we were looking for somewhere to grab lunch. We walked in to Shady Grove and were immediately seated. Our waitress brought us waters and asked us if we wanted anything else to drink. I ordered a mimosa and my friend ordered a Kettle One Shirley Temple. We decided to split two appetizers- buffalo chicken dip and Shady sticks- which were bought delightful. The buffalo chicken dip came with nacho chips and pita bread, which I thought was pretty cool. The Shady sticks were similar to breadsticks with cheese on top and marinara dipping sauce. Both of these appetizers were HUGE. We didn't finish either of them!   The only two problems I had were: 1. The only restroom is upstairs, which is annoying for the customers seated downstairs and 2. My mimosa was $9! It was a regular-size mimosa, with nothing special about it. I think $9 is a little much for a mimosa served in a champagne flute.",

They have wine nights and it does get a bit crazier later at night then. My go to is anything buffalo chicken and their wrap is one of my favorite in town. Their buffalo chicken pizza is pretty great as well. I used to crave their waffle fries with the wrap, but sadly, upon visiting yesterday, they CHANGED THEIR WAFFLE FRIES. They resemble chick fil a waffle fries which are mediocre at best. Not seasoned, and not crisp enough. I will have to switch back to sweet potatoe tots. The service is usually quick and staff almost always friendly and accommodating. They have handful of craft beers on tap with $3-$5 happy hour drafts + various apps.   This has been any favorite Pittsburgh casual fare restaurant since I discovered it years ago.   Go, you shouldn't be disappointed. Unless you expected the old waffle fries.",

First thing, this place is extremely vegetarian friendly, but not in an overtly \"I love growing my own vegetables and using vegetable oil to fuel my Prius\" sort of way.  Still plenty of options for carnivores.    I ended up ordering nachos with mango salsa to start and a southwestern salad for the the main course.  The mango salsa was great, I just wish they served more seeing as the ratio of chips to salsa was kind of lop-sided.    The southwestern salad was fantastic.  With a healthy dose of black beans avocado and this tangy vinaigrette type dressing which definitely hit the spot, I became an instant fan.  I'm usually not the type to order salads, but my friend warned me in advance of the serving size, and she wasn't lying.  They literally serve these salads in deep stainless steel bowls.  The appearance is kind of raw, but my taste buds don't lie.    Overall our experience was good, though I wish the service was a bit more prompt.  Having to wait an eternity for the check was kind of painful.  Otherwise, I'd easily give this place 4 stars.  Regardless, I'll be back in the near future to check out some of the other offerings on the menu.",

Our waitress was extremely nice and attentive. I ordered a vodka tonic and a side salad and we split the caprese pizza. This is a must try and one of my favorite pizzas. It has garlic, mozzarella, tomato, and basil. It's simple but delicious, It was cooked to perfection in their brick oven. The side salad was large and very tasty. What we like is Shady Grove always has some drink specials. Great food, service, and vibe. This is a must stop in Shadyside.",

I felt like i gained a few pounds, but the pizza was a little bland and the sandwich mainly just tasted like spinach. Their fries are crispy and taste pretty good along with their tater tots that I had on my first visit.",

I've had other things like sandwiches but always tend to gravitate toward their salads because they are so big and full of flavor. They also have fabulous happy hour specials to take advantage of if you care for a beverage. Wine Wednesday is always a hit! I never ever had an issue with service with my many times visiting.

The spicy ranch sauce that's served with it is pretty food, but the tots themselves have a weird texture.  Their waffle fries however are a winner.

Shady Grove is one of those places that is reliably good--I can't think of anything that I have ever ordered here that I did not like. The menu is large and features a variety of sandwiches (also available as wraps), burgers, pizzas, and HUGE salads. Being a fan of spicy food, some of my personal favorites are the buffalo chicken pizza (self-explanatory) and the Fiero Chicken sandwich (grilled chicken breast, pepper jack cheese, guac, lettuce, tomato, and a spicy habenero sauce). They also have these great crispy french fries which come with the sandwiches.   They do half-priced bottles of wine on Wednesday nights. I've had both good and bad experiences--it can get REALLY crowded, so if you don't get there early enough you won't get a table. It's kind of awkward when someone in your party has to then carry the wine bottle around.  Bonus points for outdoor seating! Always a good time.",

I recommend the Shady Steak Sandwich, which features steak, peppers, potato latkes, a fried egg, and garlic aioli. It is banging. The salads are extremely large, their french fries are particularly amazing, and the pizzas are great too. Overall, probably my favorite food in Shadyside. Service: 3.5/6 I'm gonna be frank, the service is pretty okay. Atmosphere: 4/6 It's a decent looking place, but nothing overly special. The music can sometimes be a little strange, or loud, but overall it is always enjoyable to eat here. Affordability: 4/6 It's not overly cheap, but it's not gonna break your bank. Pretty standard prices for what you're getting, though you do get a lot of food, which is a plus. X-Factor: 3/6 Nothing extremely special about Shady Grove, besides the Shady Steak Sandwich",

The food menu is a bit large which can be somewhat cumbersome. Although they offer a lot to choose from, impressively, most of what they offer is quite delicious. Some personal favorites are the Cobb salad and fried green tomatoes. Ticket time seems very efficient for kitchens size.   They don't offer too much space but do have outdoor seating for the warmer months. There's also additional seating upstairs. Seems to be a great spot for couples and small groups. The service is okay, at times not as quick as I'd prefer. Often feels like I have to coax somebody for attention instead of them anticipating my needs or checking back.   There are many sites to choose from in Shadyside but I'd grab a seat here if you want fresh, unique food pairings that won't break the bank.",

    "text": "Ambiance: Modern american bar and grill with a relaxed but somewhat more upscale vibe than your typical neighborhood sports bar.  Downstairs they have a large bar, and a decent number of tables wrapped around the bar area.  They do have plenty of TVs for watching the game, but this isn't really the type of place most people come to watch the tube.  There is an upstairs which is open on busier days and has both seating and its own bar.  The upstairs turns into more of a lounge after 10pm when food service stops including DJs mixing up the beats on some nights.  They also have outdoor sidewalk seating.  Drinks: They have a decent selection of beers including many craft options.  The wine list is fairly long but would leave a oenophile longing for more/better.  I've tried a few of their cocktails, which were good, but I would not describe this place as a cocktail bar.  Food: Shady Grove serves a wide variety of upscale bar food including burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, salads, and some good apps.  I've had the pizza a few times and am I fan of the buffalo chicken pizza.  The burger's are pretty good and are on special on Monday nights for 5 bucks I think.  Last night I had the shishito peppers and ahi tuna salad.  Both were very good.  Service: The service here can be variable.  We've usually had pretty good service but some nights they can get quite busy and then service has lagged, but this is the exception rather than the norm.  Overall: One of my favorite places to meet up with friends for food/drinks in Shadyside.  Tip: Wednesday is a very popular night with the Shadyside Yuppie crowd as it is half off wine bottles night (as is Friday night also).  They used to use the No Wait app but currently don't, nor do they take reservations meaning on busy nights you will need to wait for a table.",

    "text": "Man, I've been going to Shady Grove since 2008, and it's a place with many of my fond memories. That being said, it's also been a place where I've had some of my worst memories too. Perhaps due to being in college and learning how to frequent bars for the first time. Yikes.   Beer specials are pretty good here, and wine night back in the day was a pretty big hit. I remember that they would close off Walnut Grill at night, which I thought was strange. They should have all the space available, because it can get super crowded here. The food here is pretty decent. A little more on the expensive side for Pittsburgh, but who am I to complain? The pizzas are all pretty good and the sandwiches are nothing to sniff at.   Service is pretty spotty, both at the bar and the tables. Bartenders are not generally attentive and the waitstaff is usually short-staffed, so it takes awhile for you to get things like water or other small requests. Also, they're not very friendly, which is disappointing. But, it's never really been enough to ruin anything. Overall, Shady Grove is a decent bar/restaurant with subpar service. If you're looking for a low-key drink or meal during the week, Shady Grove is a solid place for just that.",

Whether you want to watch a sporting event or simply enjoy a nice, semi-casual night out--Shady Grove is your spot. The feel is young, contemporary professional rather than rowdy bar or stuffy lounge. If you want to unwind and have a decent time on a weeknight or weekend, this is the place to be; however, it may be too loud for some to enjoy.",

Normally when Bobby & I go on a walk, it's been on Centre Ave so we lately we've been switching it up and going on Walnut St. I always check <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Flivingpittsburgh.com&s=fd13cc38a530b33048b682ba67960006937f788d90bee0753f4d773d21607e00\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">livingpittsburgh.com</a> for deals around the city and found out that Monday night is burger night at Shady Grove- half price burgers.   It wasn't particularly busy, but i soon realized we JUST missed some burger festival right outside which was seeing who had the best burger in the area, so everyone must have ate while there.   Anyways, their menu seemed really great. I loved their pizza menu and we may have to stop in to try one of those. The entire menu seemed tasty (esp the sweet potato tator tots) I decided on the Shady burger which was a large burger topped with american cheese, bacon, egg & usual toppings- lettuce, tomato, onion & pickle. It comes with a side of fries, but you can upgrade to waffle fries or tots for $1. As delicious as the tots sounded, i loooove waffle fries so that was my choice. My burger was tasty and piled high.   I would have gave them 4 stars if the service was a tad better. Our server was a sweetie but everything took foreverrrrr- being greeted, our drinks after ordering, the food (which most likely wasn't her fault) It was just annoying waiting around to be waited on and for the drinks when as i mentioned earlier it wasn't overly busy. Also, after getting my food, my drink was empty the entire time. She walked by and looked right at it but never brought another one.   Overall, we may stop back but will most likely sit at the bar.",

The menu was big with a lot of unique appetizers and probably the biggest salad selection I've seen lately. I also liked how almost all of the sandwiches could be served on brioche or a wrap. My friend got the chicken florentine on brioche with  fries and I had the FGBLT (fried green tomatoes) with sweet potato tots. Everything was delicious and the sandwiches are big so we only ate half and took the rest to go. We shared our fries and tots and agreed that the fries were good but the tots were SO good you could tell they were homemade. They were almost more circular shaped than normal tots and they came with some sort of zesty ranch type dipping sauce that went perfect. The ambiance was dark and cool for a date night or girls night out like we did! I'd definitely go back.",

Last evening my friends and the mother of one of the girls I was with were in the neighborhood, so we decided to stop in and see if they were still serving food.   There was a sign out that said \"please seat yourself\" and two gentleman manning the door. Given the two men monitoring the door and the late hour we imagined the kitchen might be closed and that it was drinks only (although people were inside eating, so we were on a he fence). So we asked the one guy if we would need IDs to get in (we are only 20 yrs old), and he said yes. That was fine, no problem, we would leave since we are not yet 21.  We turned around to leave and the guy hollered, \"haha yeah, go back to your little house party, ladies,\" at us in a very rude and snarky tone.   We were all appalled by this employee's uncalled for outcry, but decided to ignore the jab. However, his condescending attitude is enough for me to never want to go back and try to eat there again. While I cannot say anything about the food, I had a terrible first impression of Shitty Grove and I hope that the rest of the staff is kinder than that young grump.",
