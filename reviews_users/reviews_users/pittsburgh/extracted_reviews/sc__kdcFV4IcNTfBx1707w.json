    "text": "I came here upon recommendation from a nearby antique shop owner.  She said Obama likes to eat there you have to try the hotcakes!  So I figured I should listen to the lady and try out some of Pamela's Obamacakes.  We tried the chorizo hash and the banana walnut hotcakes.  Everything was delicious and I am glad we got to split one savory and one sweet dish between us. The service was good as well.  I took away one star because the place could have been a little cleaner (napkins and trash on the floor) and I really don't like when they leave the cream from the previous diners for you to use on the table.",

I got the tex-mex omelet and my brother in law got a bacon egg and cheese on a bagel.  My omelet was HUGE and came with two big pieces of white bread and potatoes.  Bro-in-law loved his sandwich.  My huge omelet was $7 and his huge breakfast sandwich was $4.  Those same two dishes are double that back home in Connecticut.  Only downside is the place is cash only, but for prices like that it's worth it.",

The food is always good at P&G's, but I am deducting two stars for the atrocious service we got on our last visit. It was our first time dining there on a slow day - the Wednesday morning after New Year's, and there were only five occupied tables in the whole restaurant. We sat right in the middle of the room, yet were utterly ignored for almost ten minutes, and another couple that sat well after us was visited first. Then the server screwed up my girlfriend's crepe order, and the replacement was wrong also. I know that the restaurant practically prints money because it's such an institution, but it says a lot about a restaurant when they mail it in this badly on a slow day. There are a lot of other options in the Strip District; maybe we should go elsewhere next time.",

    "text": "Thank God for coffee! especially when it's cold! It's good diner food but nothing really to run out and crow about! It's solid short order food with nothing terribly standing out! When you arrive at the diner be ready there will be a wait; what feels like an annoying way to long for what your getting on your plate wait. When you are seated the servers are busy, super busy and yet they find a way to be courteous and are on top of it at all times. I have never had a problem with the servers and they are very helpful when needed. As I have pointed out at the beginning of the review there is nothing really to crow about here. It's dinner food with the potatoes cooked in a large batch which means that your Lyonnaise potatoes are very hit and miss. Sometime you get a well cook morning potatoes tender and tasty then on the other occasions you end up with a lump of semi cooked not so tender kinda cold mess. The rest is relatively blase and as I said standard diner food... One major disappointment was the \"pancakes\". I was ready for light n' fluffy golden goodness ready to soak up some syrup and fill my belly. Instead I was greeted with crepe style more Nordic pancakes. So for those of you who love a traditional fluffy golden pancake you will be met with disappointment. Also the last couple of times I've gone in their pancakes have had a heavy baking soda flavor present.  Now I know this place is a Pittsburgh favorite with pictures on the walls when you first come in showing even President Obama ate there. I can tell you that it's serviceable diner food nothing really stands out and makes me go WOW! Which leads me to believe this place used to be the bomb diggity but now is primarily getting by on reputation alone. It's worth the visit to say you've been but not the repeat as it's just another diner with just another plate of odd pancakes and run of the mill food.",

    "text": "Believe it or not, my native Pittsburgher boyfriend had never been to Pamela's.  So when he brought me home to meet the parents, he thought it would be a great chance for us all to give it a try.    We went early (8:30am- yikes!) on a Sunday morning and got in easily without any wait.  The inside is bright, colorful, and vintage-retro diner kitschy.  I have to admit I got a little distracted looking at all the old black and white photos on the walls.    I couldn't make up my mind when it came time to order- which never happens.  I decided to go with the most diverse option and got the breakfast that included eggs, bacon, toast, and 2 of their crepe-style thin pancakes.    The eggs were great but the pancakes were a little too thin for my taste.  The edges tasted crispy but in a burnt way.  I also think I set my expectations too high, after reading all the rave Yelp reviews.  Naturally, I filled up quickly and could only eat half of the pancakes.  There was no way I'd be able to finish both.  The best part of the meal had to have been my boyfriend's potatoes.  YUM!  They were soft but crispy on the top, flavorful but not overseasoned.  Fluffy but not greasy.  Total perfection!  I'd take them over the crepes if I had a chance to go back.",

    "text": "Yes, the famous place.  This is where Obama had pancakes during the primary season, and liked it so much that he invited Pamela to the White House to make some more.  And the place is regularly featured on the Food Network.  But being only a couple of blocks away from the original Primanti's, could this place be that good?    Well, I had a fantastic breakfast here.  I had their famous chocolate chip hot cake with bananas and whipped cream.  The pancake is very thin, almost like a crepe, but its texture is crispy which is very surprising and nice.  Also the richness of the butter in the batter really comes through.  The sweetness of the chocolate chips, the whipped cream, and the bananas interplays nicely making for a great dish, and the portion is very generous.  I additionally opted for a side of their Lyonnaise potatoes.  Rustically presented, however, these were delicious too and deserve as much attention.    Some general notes on the restaurant.  The wait in line to get in early on a Sunday morning was about 20 minutes.  The diner itself is a bit rundown and has a very 50s feel to it.  I think it contrasts very nicely with the quality of the food.  It's not hype, go check it out.",

I enjoyed my omelet --great flavor, though the GUACAMOLE looked like the prepackaged ones that are liquified.  Not a fan of the guac...maybe I'm spoiled with an abundance of avocados in Cali but I like my avocados fresh, not from a bag.   The potatoes were good...not sure its worth all the rave about them though...  I'd order the omelete again but not the HOTCAKES.  Its not a matter of preference between crepe cakes or fluffy pancakes...I don't discriminate between them.  If they are good, they're good.  I couldn't have more than a few bites of these hotcakes.  They were way to greasy.  So greasy that I was clearing my throat from it for the next 30 minutes after I left Pamela's.  SERVICE: The minimum --seat you, water, order, serve you food, then the ck when you flag them down.  BOTTOM LINE: I'm glad I got a chance to try this place out.  I wouldn't visit again if the wait is longer than 20 min and I wouldn't feel like I'm missing out if I don't come back.  I can see why people enjoy this place, its just not for me.  Maybe I'm spoiled from the large number of great breakfast places in the LA and SF area??",

Our waiter definitely answered more than his fair share of questions (what comes on the waffles? caramel you say!). No problem getting water and coffee refills (we needed both for sure). And of course they'll call a cab for you while you settle the bill because it's raining. :)  The eggs and bacon in my \"The Morning After\" special were your standard diner fare...but the HOTCAKES. OMG they were so good. I swear they are cooked in bacon grease or something, and the perimeter of them is edged in crispy goodness 2 inches in. And I only got the plain ones (come with butter, and you can add syrup). Other tablemates got strawberries (sugar added) and banana (sugar not added, so less sweet).   Decor is 1950s nostalgic B&W photographs posted everywhere. Classic diner tables and chairs.   Great way to end a trip to Pittsburgh. Doesn't hurt that FLOTUS, POTUS, and the Japanese prime minister ate here either.",

Firstly, these types of '50s style diners don't really exist in my city, so I appreciated the kitsch.  Old family photos really made the place feel homey.  We ordered:  Greek Salad ($7.50, huge, dressing on the side which was a plus!), Veg Omelet ($7.95, I got mine with 2 slices of toast & potatoes), & Chorizo Hash ($5.95, wanted to try it).  All the portions were HUGE, shareable between at least 2ppl!  I ate just a bit of the Hash and had to get it to-go because I was simply stuffed by eating half of the Veg Omelet.    Although tasty, I found the Lyonnaise Potatoes a bit heavy on the salt as well as the Chorizo Hash (probably from the Chorizo/cheese).  Then again, I found a lot of the food in the city, especially potatoes, too salty, so maybe I'm just not used to it.  The coffee was ok, although I found all the coffees that I had in Pitts to be on the watery side.  Service was no muss, no fuss!  Would definitely visit again for that diner experience, healthy portions, & solid food.",

One watch out...the area that you use to wait for a table seems to crowd some of the tables up front of the restaurant... Btw...they only take cash.",

Perhaps the 45 minute wait on a weekend made my expectations skyrocket. I ordered the Gail's eggs and they came out good. Nice bread, well done scrambled eggs and ok-hash browns. Great coffee! The service is really good for how crowded the place is. The hot cakes are really soft and yummy. You know a place is old school when they are cash only and it takes a 10 minute wait at the cash counter to pay ones check! You have to tick the box if you haven't been here, if nothing else but to experience a traditional local joint.. but now that I have, a couple times.. I could quite easily pass up Pamela's for other brunch options in the strip.",

Their pancakes & potatoes...OMG Amazing!! Their pancakes are super thin, almost like a crepe and they are crispy around the edges. Their potatoes are fresh cut and so delicious. They're so good and have so much flavor you don't even need to dip them in ketchup.  Their omelettes are also to die for. Fluffy, thick and full of flavor.  The only downside to Pamela's is their food is a bit greasy and not healthy whatsoever. Therefore I do not eat @ Pamela's on a regular basis but when I do I enjoy every bite!!",

    "text": "My wife and I ate at Pamela's the morning of the Pirates home opener, and even though it was 35 degrees outside, there was still about a 10-minute wait. But that isn't much of an issue because they have two dining areas and keep the queue moving pretty quickly. The service isn't really friendly, but it's efficient. And to be honest, that's more important in a tight, cramped, busy diner like Pamela's. I ordered a broccoli, cheddar and ham omelet, which was loaded with real, off-the-bone ham. It could have used more broccoli, but it was still very good. My wife, who loves poached eggs, had to settle for basted because they don't have the ability to poach (I don't understand why). She wasn't crazy about the greasiness of them, nor was she too happy with the canned side of fruit. So it's a mixed review for us. I liked it; her, not so much. What we do agree on though is that it is still second to DeLuca's when it comes to breakfast in the Strip District (and maybe third when you factor in Kelly O's).",

Let me tell u, do not leave Pamela's without trying their amazing pancakes!! They are absolutely delicious, I love the crispy edges, buttery and soft.

The servers were awesome, prices are great, we didn't wait very long for a seat (however long would have been worth it though). I'm so glad I had the trash mash.

I asked if I could substitute a side of fruit for the meat, but was told only potatoes could be used as a substitute.

    "text": "Pamela's has been well covered by other Yelpers so I'll keep my review brief.   This place hits all of the right classic diner notes and then some: it's comfortable, friendly, full of locals, and awash in vintage Pittsburgh centric Americana but most importantly, the food is awesome.  Well, I should qualify that, I can at least say  the pancakes are awesome, because that's all that I tried and frankly that's all I need to try as I have a deep abiding love for all types of fried breakfast cakes and can rarely resist the urge to order them when dining out in the morning (and as a side note I am frankly waiting for the hipster restaurateur set to open a place where I can have a late-night short stack in my neck of the woods).  The pancakes, or hotcakes as they are called, are basically large crispy-edged crepes that are fried in what must be a mountain of butter. You can order straight-ahead versions of the hotcakes or signature ones that come stuffed with things like banana and chocolate, or fruit and sour cream. My wife and I got two orders of the hotcakes: one plain and one with strawberries and sour cream inside and I have to say that despite how strange the latter one sounds it was delicious, and perhaps more importantly, the sour cream counters the sweetness of the dish which means that you don't hit \"the wall\" so early on with them, which if you are in a gluttonous kind of mood is a good thing.  The best part is that everything is entirely reasonable - the pancakes are like $6-$8 and are enough food to allow you to skip lunch.   Go check this place out, and come hungry.",

Seems to have a high table turnover however since I only waited 25 mins for a table of two. Food was typical American diner, salty and smothered in butter. Good for that once a month cheat day.",

The wait was 20 minutes which wasn't horrible although considering it was a weekday was a bit shocking to me. The decor was extremely adorable and added to the atmosphere. It was decorated in baby blue and pink with pictures of who I'm assuming is Pamela throughout her childhood. I ordered the Pittsburgh Hash which was hash-browns with sauerkraut, swiss cheese, and kielbasa (although I ordered it without because I'm vegetarian) and it was great. It was a combination I wouldn't have dreamed of but worked well. It came with eggs which were done great as well and toast- thick Italian bread that was cooked perfectly. My friend had the Strawberry Hotcakes were delicious and she loved them. My only problem with the experience was the service. The host who took us to our table was extremely rude and gave our table to someone else immediately after we didn't hear him call our name. Our waitress wasn't rude but she seemed very indifferent and not super friendly but I guess she was waiting on so many tables that's understandable. Overall, I would definitely come here again- the food makes up for the not great service.",

I like the restaurant in the Strip District the best -- cool location and lots going on during the week and weekend. It doesn't really matter what you get because you're gonna be pleased. The best scenario is that you had a late night and working off a bit of a hangover. Stop here, order a coffee, and then some of their pancakes which are actually more of a crepe or a galette (made with flour and unsweetened). These are thin like a crepe, and don't need any syrup. Get 'em with sausage or bacon. Then turn to your main breakfast. I suggest one of the hashes, either corn beef or a sauerkraut and cheese. Wonderful. The place is bare bone as far as interior, but you're there for the food. Why anyone would go to a chain restaurant is beyond my comprehension -- stop in here instead. Prices are seriously fair and service is good. And if you don't know much about the Pittsburgh accent, you'll discover it year. Yinz are gonna like this place.",

Not to mention while you're waiting, if you're just visiting the city - peruse the rest of the area before and after, you may have to leave \"that guy\" waiting in line for ya because if you don't you get bumped - old school right! haha Once you're seated - holy crap they're quick.  I mean from the first round of waters, to the ordering, even to getting the food to you - even if it is mostly breakfast food, still! If you've got that person in the group or pair that \"just/already ate\" - ditch them or make them get hungry because this place will easily put you into a food coma after the first bite! I tend to eat a lot and I almost didn't finish my plate - that should never happen - least of all to me. haha Anyway, highly recommend.",

It's a special and bit always on the menu, but never fear, there are other lovely treats for you to try too.  If you want an awesome breakfast in Pittsburgh, then Pamela's is your place.  The crepe pancakes with banana, walnuts and whipped cream are heavenly!   I recommend getting a savory breakfast for one person and a sweet for the other person and sharing.   Cash only-so don't forget the green!  The servers are very nice and helpful.  Expect a line on the weekends-a place this good has to be busy!  Don't expect fru fru coffee drinks or hand squeezed orange juice-but do expect excellent food!",

Only half of our group was there but they were nice enough to seat us anyway. The service seemed a little disorganized. We had three servers come up and ask if our table had ordered drinks yet. And then throughout the meal, we had trouble chasing one down to get more water.   Three of us got the morning after breakfast with regular, banana walnut and strawberry hotcakes. He fourth got the Tex-Mex omelette, which was pretty good. On my plate were regular sunny side up eggs and super salty bacon. The hotcakes seemed like they couldn't decide if they were a crepe or a pancake, but definitely more on the fluffier side. The strawberry was definitely the best. I felt like the banana in the banana walnut made the hotcakes taste drier. Very fluffy though! I didn't think the meal was anything special or something I couldn't get at another diner/breakfast place.   Also, it's cash only! Very affordable though.",

I was skeptical, especially when I saw that it was a chain, but in favor of preserving the friendship, I went along.   And I'm glad that I did. Although there was a sizable wait on a Saturday afternoon, everything was delicious. I tried the corned beef hash and the regular hot cakes, and like most of the other reviews here, I was in awe at how delicious the pancakes are.   I'm not telling you something you don't already know but if you're in Pittsburgh, even if only for a few hours, your time is best spent here.",

Expect longer waits than the other locations, not that the wait isn't worth it, because it totally is! My favorite part of this spot is the aroma. The second someone opens the door you get a whiff of syrup, mixed in with all the other Strip District food smells.   They have a nice mix of savory and sweet breakfast options. I'm a savory kind of breakfast person. I typically order the same thing at the P&G diner: Tex-Mex Omelet. But, this trip I decided to get really wild and order the Pam's Trash Hash, which was Lyonnaise potatoes mixed with sloppy joe, jalapenos, bacon, and topped with American cheese with a side of scrambled eggs. It was good! Probably switch back to my regular, next time.  I still prefer the Millvale location, but if you're looking for breakfast in the strip. This is one of the best options you'll find.",

We were in a bit of a hurry so we went in for take out. Te service was excellent and staff were extremely friendly. So nice to not be in New York as friendly in New York is not even close to what it is in Pittsburgh. The food came out quickly and wife and I were off. I thought the pricing w a bit high, Wife said probably got wrong bill???? my bad maybe. The sandwich ws ok not anything special to talk about. The service and staff i would give 5 stars, But the food was about a 2-3. I was told it is better to eat there when you have more time and that the pancakes are totally amazing. The next time I'm in Pittsburgh ill definitely give it another shot but we will eat there instead of take out",

I got the veggie omelette which was so good. The veggies were all fresh and the eggs were cooked great. And the potatoes. Oh my gosh. One of the best sides you'll find anywhere. The waitress was so nice and despite having many other tables she needed to take care of, was super attentive. I wish I had gotten her name but I forgot :( can't wait to go back!",

Holy crap, I love crepes and I love pancakes and they merged them together here into some sort of delicious hybrid that I am drooling about right now. They're fluffy but thin and so perfect. I had them with sausage, so I just slathered everything in an unhealthy amount of maple syrup and had the best breakfast.  They also have Lyonnaise potatoes that are just so creamy and good. I was trying to not eat them all but I was totally trying to eat them all.  It's cash only and it's really popular, so there might be a wait to get in. It's a vintage diner, but very large. It's also cheap, which is even more appealing given the size of the portions.  Great breakfast place, will 100% return for more crepe hotcakes the next time I'm in Pittsburgh.",

The food was ok breakfast food, not the best I have had.  I ordered the Lyonnaise potatoes which have onions in it and the spinach feta omelet.  It was a good omelet, but nothing out of the ordinary.  My husband ordered the western omelet, potatoes and wheat bread.  The food was fine, but nothing extraordinary.

The hand pattied chorizo had enough spice to remind you that you were eating chorizo, but not drain your sinuses either! Eggs were cooked to perfection and the potatoes were soft and flavorful. The wife got the strawberry hotcakes which was also another strong effort by the kitchen. The hotcakes are a thin pancake that acts as a crepe. The crepe is stuffed with fruit, brown sugar, and sour cream. It sounds weird, but it totally works!!  This place loses a star because it is a cash only establishment. And because it's 2016 and I'm an adult, I expected to be able to pay the bill with my card since I rarely carry cash when traveling domestically. So I had to walk around the corner to PNC ATM and get wallet raped to the tune of almost $4 to get some cash out.",

I also don't think the prices are that great - 9.5$ for bacon and some fried bread. And this place is CASH ONLY, which they do not advertise clearly. I found out after eating and was forced to walk to the nearby ATM and incur a $3 convenience charge. Maybe if this place wasn't so hyped up I would've enjoyed it more. I wouldn't go back.",

Don't miss the small display of classic artifacts near the cash register, including Barack Obama's handwritten note that \"I love those pancake!\" [sic]   Cash only!",

The good thing about this is the location. If you have a decent wait you can just walk the strip for a little while you wait.   There is something special about the pancakes here. They are thin and delicious with nice crispy edges. They tickle my fancy every time they grace my lips. I always get \"the morning after\" which comes with pancakes, meat, eggs and a side of lyonnese potatoes. Please get the lyonnese potatoes! You will thank me later! I am writing this review and am going to get in my car and head to Pamelas as soon as I'm done, yes it's that good!   I am not a fan of Obama but we can definitely agree that Pamelas is the number one breakfast spot in the burgh!",

There really isn't a great waiting area and the hostess doesn't take your name, instead you write it on a piece of paper and put the size or your party next to it. You will not be given a wait time unless you ask. Even with a large number of people, the turnaround is fairly quick. We had over 10 parties in front of us and got seated in less than 30 minutes. The food is good. I got a breakfast sandwich on Italian bread ( aka white bread). It had a fried egg, cheese and cut sausage links and was really good. My husband got French toast and thought it was great, better than our favorite breakfast place to go back home. It was fluffy and had a good flavor. We both got bacon and man was it the tastiest bacon I've ever eaten, it just needed to be a bit crisper (but we didn't ask for it crispy, we know better for next time). The coffee was solid. Not the best cup I've ever had but not the worst either. Overall I think the ravings for this place are well deserved. It's a good homemade style breakfast for a decent price!",

The atmosphere is relaxed and a little on the loud side, but you can still have an intimate conversation...quickly...before your food arrives. The service is fast paced and if you're lucky, you won't have to wait to find a seat.  Soon after you sit down, get comfortable, and begin observing the old pictures and wall decor, a waiter is ready to take your order.  We ordered coffee first and it was maybe a medium dark or house blend, served at just the right temperature. For our meals, we ordered the popular crepe style hotcakes with sausage and I added scrambled eggs with cheese. We took around 3 sips of coffee before our food arrived. They serve their food fast! The hotcakes were perfectly cooked with nice crispy edges. The sausage were link style; and the eggs were cooked well done with cheese, just the way I like them. I had no complaints, the meal met our expectations and was prepared well. Just like most Pittsburgh diners, you can only pay with cash. Also, they do not have free parking, it is either a metered spot or $5 a day along the market place on Smallman.  It's a nice place take family visiting from out of town or if you want to try their popular crepe Hotcakes.",

As the inimitable Leslie Knope once said: \"We need to remember what's important in life: friends, waffles, and work.\" As of yesterday, though, I might have to rethink my stance on the waffle vs. pancake debate.  Yesterday, in the cool light of the morning, I saw God in the most incredible stack of crepe-style pancakes this side of the Atlantic Ocean. These are not your Saturday morning box pancakes. They're not even the golden, fluffy kind you stumble into your local diner for in the wee hours of the morning.  That's because these pancakes are not pancakes. They're religious objects. They're the very personification of whatever deity you worship here on earth. Hell, I haven't been to church in five years but I might just go back and light a candle for these pancakes. God bless them.  Please, please, PLEASE do yourself a favor and order a stack of these pancakes. The fries are great, and I'm sure the rest of their menu is just as drool-worthy, but if you really want to experience some sort of celestial happiness: Get. The. Pancakes.  I'll be back, Pamela's.

I got the broccoli cheese omelette and my boyfriend got banana pancakes with walnuts and the ham and eggs. These are both delicious options. Their special potatoes are delicious. Coffee is brought to the table by the pitcher, which is much appreciated. Cash only, but guess what---it won't be that much because Pamela's is totally reasonable.",

    "text": "If you're in Pittsburgh and like to eat, it's a given that sooner or later you're going to end up in the Strip District. Several establishments there are already in the Roadfood pantheon and for good reason. However, ask any 'Burgher where to find the best breakfast in the city and they will invariably point you in the direction of a spot on the northeast side of the Strip with pink and teal decor and a consistently large crowd in front of it.  Its official name is P & G's Pamela's Diner, P being Pam Cohen and G being Gail Klingensmith, the owners, but everyone just calls it Pamela's. It's reminiscent of a kitschy fifties diner, with Formica tables and vinyl chairs and brightly colored plates. It is always packed and always loud, and you WILL wait for a table. But, it's fun to look at the retro ads and random family photographs and pictures of President Obama posing with the owners while you wait.  You will see pancakes, or as Pamela's calls them, hotcakes. These cakes are closer to crepes than traditional flapjacks. Thin with crisp lacy edges, they completely cover the plate. Get them with butter and syrup, or fresh fruit and whipped cream, or chocolate chips and bananas. Actually, they're not bad plain, either. To complete the carb overload, get a side of Lyonnaise potatoes, a mass of buttery spuds and caramelized onions.  Although I have nothing against the hotcakes and Lyonnaise, I happen to really like Pamela's egg dishes and hashes. Yes, that's kielbasa and sauerkraut mixed with the Lyonnaise and topped with Swiss cheese to form Pittsburgh Hash. The chorizo hash is good too, as is the Tex-Mex omelet. My favorite Pamela's meal, though, is pretty simple--a sausage and cheese omelet with some of the best fries I've ever had (fries with breakfast is a Northeast thing). The Lyonnaise gets the raves, but the fries keep me coming back. Service is efficient, and even though your check will be dropped off with your food, you'll never feel rushed.  Pamela's has five other locations in and around Pittsburgh, but if someone is talking about going there, they usually mean the Strip District. Note--no lunch food is served on Sundays, and like most Strip establishments, it's strictly cash.",

A half-day at work resulted in a few extra hours of free time for Yelp Pittsburgh's most controversial reviewer. Having been to and enjoyed the Dickies out of the Mount Lebanon Pamela's, I felt that I was beyond due to dine at the Strip District location.   As is typical of a Pamela's the decor is retro, effortlessly kitschy, and familial, pink and blue being the dominant color scheme. Pictures of unknown relatives embellish the interiors further. You feel as if you recognize them all, even though you don't. It's as if you're eating at a restaurant from an unaired episode of \"Leave It To Beaver\" that was directed by John Waters in another reality, and I don't know about you, but I find that fun. Now, onto da grub, bub...  Whenever I come to places such as Pamela's after 11AM, I'm always caught betwixt craving lunchtime or breakfast fare. In this case, as I often do, I split my longings between entree and dessert.   The P&G Diner Burger had my number. A half-pound burger is topped  with fried jalepenos, onion straws, lettuce, tomato, near-liquid, gorgeously melted cheddar, ketchup, and mayonnaise. A sesame seed roll (the menu says Kaiser for some reason) held the medium-rare patty and all other contents. A mild sting contrasted with crunch, cream, sharpness, and pure lusciousness, the fresh, plush bun absorbing the fabulous flavors well.   The \"famous Lyonnaise potatoes\" were merely very good home fries browned brittle on the outside in butter and cut rustically, exposing their inner mashed spud fluff.   Dessert was a powerded sugar-dusted Crispy Malted Waffle that I customized with chocolate chips. Like the aforementioned tubers, the waffle that that crusty exterior/soft interior my mouth admires, the chocolate bits bleeding black all over my plate. Hardly requiring syrup, the delectable Belgian disk was also a bit chewy a la sourdough bread as well as muffin-ish in texture. A scoop of ice cream and a ladle of hot fudge would have been welcome, if decadent and extraneous, additions. Nonetheless, as I keep saying, pancakes and waffles of the non-savory kind are a finish to me, not a main course, and this waffle was most certainly one killer confection.   Luckily, I came by in the middle of a weekday, which meant that I was seated quickly. The gent that waited on me was superb at his vocation, his confidence, accuracy, and speed indicating that he'd been proudly waiting on hungry patrons for a good while.   Pamela's pummels much of her competition with homey, well-prepared diner staples and friendly service that's designed to get customers fed and on their way, just like in the days of trenchcoats, fedoras, gentlemen, and dames.   That's 2 sisters, and I believe 4 to go before I complete the Pamela's circuit. Millvale, Oakland, Squirrel Hill, and Shadyside: I got dates with all of yinz, and I'll bring bills. Don't you worry. I know how you girls are about charge cards.",

Tuesday morning proved to be a fast pass to the diner and a great breakfast; I was in at 8:20 and out in 30 minutes in time to be back at work. I ordered the classic breakfast and added hotcakes. I'll just share that this is not for the weak hearted or stomach(ed)- lots of grease and butter (perhaps a hangover food), but what else would you expect from a diner? After refillable coffee, The Bill came out to $11 and some change and it's cash only. Anyone traveling here in the near future (around 9/2018): be prepared for your uber to get lost with all of the road closures and one way streets (add 10 min to your normal/projected commute). Lastly, didn't drink enough coffee to review the toilet situation, I'm sorry!",

My go to is the strawberry hot cakes and the famous potatoes. Both are delicious. My boyfriend tried the California French toast today--he said it was good. The sweet items are always very sweet (I usually plan to take home half). It's a great place when you're feeling indulgent.  My biggest tip--go on a week day. The weekends frequently have lines out the door. It can be cramped (especially in the Oakland and Strip District locations) but on weekdays I've never had trouble just strolling in.  All of the locations are known for their decor but I especially enjoy Mt Lebanon and the space cat mural.",

Eggs over medium, sausage links with their \"crepe-style\" pancakes at the recommended of the waitress. Pancakes are unique and very good. They're thin and crunchy around the outside. I would absolutely go again if I ever find myself in the strip district again.",

I come here on Wednesday mornings once a month to meet with a tech group, so I have no concept of what the weekend rush is like.  As we know by now, though, Hungry Angelica does not wait well, so I can't imagine it would be very pleasant!  I've had the Western Omelet, which is delicious and so plentiful I have to take half home, but I love the American French Toast.  It isn't creamy and thick like traditional French toast, it's like your mom would make it - white bread with a sweet egg batter that's got a good crust on it.  Best when eaten with butter and maple syrup because otherwise it's a little egg-y.  Comfort food in my book.  The coffee is great.  The servers all seem to be pregnant at the same time (not a knock against the place - heh - just an interesting fact) but they're quick with the refills and usually pretty attentive to when you're ready to order/done with your food.  The atmosphere is traditional 50's diner.  Can't ask for much more.",

The portion size was gargantuan, with a mountain of hash piled alongside two scrambled eggs and some butted wheat toast. I scooped hash and egg onto the toast, soaking the mixture in hot sauce before devouring the entire plate. I sipped watery diner-style coffee between bites. My meal was incredible and fully deserving of 5 stars but the service was less than outstanding. The waitress seemed distracted and wasn't particularly attentive, although the restaurant was not busy at the time.  Pamela's is my first recommendation for breakfast in the strip district. The fact that they only accept cash adds to the retro 1950s vibe and overall diner experience.",

There's something about this place that is a mix of greasy diner and delicious spot on breakfast that's hard to match. My parents always make me take them there when they come into town. The morning after breakfast special with special strawberry hot cakes really can't be beaten. It's a lot of food (almost too much food) and those hot cakes with the brown sugar and sour cream. The edges are perfectly crispy and they're more like a crepe/pancake baby. Don't plan on eating lunch folks. I've also had the corn beef hash which is delicious as well as the French toast croissant and the Tex-mex omelet. All worth having a second and third time. Word to the wise, they don't accept credit cards so make sure you bring cash. And be prepared to wait if you don't get there when they first open, I promise it's worth it though. The only problem about this place is that you don't know what to order because everything is so stellar.",

Besides, I woke up really late and was hungry for some good ol' diner food and a hearty breakfast.  At 1:30pm the restaurant had many available tables open so we were seated promptly.  Yay for bottomless cups of coffee! Coffee isn't too great but it does the trick.  STRAWBERRY HOTCAKES: They can only be described as a pancake disguised as a crepe.  The edges are crunchy and they're filled with strawberries and brown sugar. Top that with the whipped cream and some syrup - not bad! I didn't find them anything to rave about but they were different from the usual pancake.  Our waitress was a little slow on bringing it out though so it was a little on the cold side :(  CUBAN SANDWICH: We choose the onion rings to accompany the sandwich. What a great choice! The Cuban Sandwich was delicious. It was a tasty combo of pork, pickles, cheese, mayo and mustard between two dense and crunchy pieces of bread. Between bites of the sandwich I stuffed my mouth with their fantastic onion rings! Those onion rings are some of the best i've ever had! They had a thick, fluffy, crunchy fried batter which made them worth every bite.  A side of LYONNAISE POTATOES: I am in love with these potatoes! Everyone's right, do try them!!  CASH ONLY!",

I had the chorizo and eggs with potatoes and toast, couldn't finish it all despite being super hungry (that's hungry, with a cape) when we arrived. One tablemate ordered a short stack of pancakes, the pancakes were the size of the dinner plate!! So lots of food, which is great, but minus a star for cash only (who carries cash anymore?) and minus a star for the poor tasting coffee. Because what's breakfast without a good cup of coffee?",

    "text": "Anytime we have guests from out of town staying with us, I make time to take them to Pamela's, especially if they have not been there before! Pamela's is located in the Strip District and is a hot spot on weekends, so plan on going during an \"off time\" on another day if possible! However, it is worth the wait. There is limited street parking, however, there is 2 hour parking located behind the businesses of The Strip. Also, be aware that this place is cash only, so make sure you are prepared!   The building screams diner inside and out! Teals, pinks, and creams adorn the walls along with hundreds of dated pictures. There is quite a bit of seating available with the neighboring guests seated a foot away - this keeps the dining experience interesting because you may meet people from all over! The bathrooms are very small and my experience was one of toilet paper on the floor and missing toilet holders. Probably one of the only negatives I have to say about this place.  The food - those hotcakes - TO DIE FOR!! I have not ventured to trying anything else on the menu since the first time I visited Pamela's as they are delectable. I have had the banana walnut, strawberry, and blueberry hotcakes, each delicious in their own way. You would have to purchase anything additional, such as bacon or homefries if you want them, however, the two hotcakes themselves are enough to satisfy almost any appetite. Though I have selected my favorite dish at this restaurant, they have a lot of breakfast items to offer - the typical egg breakfast combinations along with french toast,  various types of sandwiches, and   multiple omelette combinations.You are sure to find something that you like.    If you are in The Strip, do not hesitate to check this place out for breakfast or brunch. You will not regret your decision!",

    "text": "Pamela's is considered the quintessential Pittsburgh breakfast joint. This is the place that everyone wants to take you as soon as you come to the city. When I first moved to Pittsburgh, I can't tell you how many times I was asked, \"Have you been to Pamela's yet?\" Locals love this place. I have been there twice now, and I regret to say that I am not so enamored with it.  I am not usually a huge diner fan to begin with, so I will just preface my review by saying that. I don't enjoy the old-school vibes exuded by diners, nor the greasy fried food options. Today at Pamela's I had the western omelette, which included ham, onions, and peppers. I wasn't extremely impressed with the flavor of the omelette, and it tasted very overly buttery. The Italian toast on the side came out cold which was a big turn off for me. The redeeming factor of this breakfast was the lyonnaise potatoes, which (although greasy) were very tasty.   As a whole, I give the meal a 2/5. It just wasn't impressive or special, and was comparable in taste and quality to all the other diner food I've had before in my life. I much prefer the freshness of breakfast options found at places like Marty's Market, which is only a couple blocks away from Pamela's in the strip. I know that Pamela's is a big Pittsburgh tradition, but I won't be bringing my out of town visitors here any time soon.",

But believe me, it was.    All of the following were simply perfect, up there with the best I've ever had:   - Pamela's signature crepe-like hot cakes of buttery goodness, crispy on the edges, yet flavorful, just perfect by their lonesome, or with fruit or chocolate  - Turkey sausage:  no casing, pressed down like latkes until a deep medium brown, super flavorful, almost rich, nicely spiced  - Fries:  They must be beer-battered.  They were not greasy, perfectly crispy, lightly salted, just perfection.  I ate all of them and there was a serving the size of my head.  And I have zero regrets.   - Corned beef hash with Lyonnaise potatoes:  It's the corned beef hash I dream of.  Perfectly salted, with small cubes of potatoes and onions, and corned beef.    I can't speak to the veggie omelet though a member of my party ate that.  The veggies looked like they might be frozen veggies, but come here for more of a splurge.  Because it's worth it.",

Add in the fact that President Obama invited Pamela and Gail (hint: P & G) to cook for his family at the White House, and you've got the makings of a fun place to try.  We knew we were headed to the Strip District on Saturday morning, rain or shine, and thanks to some kind Uber drivers, we were told that getting to Pamela's in the 9am hour would help us limit our wait time. They were right, and we were seated within 10ish minutes of arrival (again, being a party of 2 really helped with that.) We had our cash and were ready to decide on the menu. Wow...everything looked delicious...but one of us had to try the pancakes, right? I opted for a basic breakfast - eggs, bacon and of course, Pamela's pancakes. He went with corned beef hash, because try as they might, the west coast restaurants can never seem to get it quite \"right.\"  The hash was fantastic, exactly as he remembered as a kid growing up in NYC. The pancakes, WOW. Full disclosure: I'm not a huge pancake person, I prefer toast as a vehicle to the delicious butter flavor. That being said, these were AMAZING. They manage to get them crispy on the edge, buttery, but still soft and delicious in the middle. I have a feeling the thinness of the \"cake\" is the reason for this, but it was truly great. We both loved them, so much that the two cakes were gone while an egg still sat on the plate - that NEVER happens in our world.   If you're a lover of diner food and have some time in the morning hit up the Strip District location of Pamela's - it really is worth the wait!",

Then once I got there you immediately see about four photos of Obama which makes you even more believe the place is likely very good.   With that being said the place is very busy so prepare to wait and they do not allow reservations. This is not a huge deal though unless you have a large group 5+ as the place is large and people come and go quickly.   Now finally to the food.. it was high quality diner food. The pancakes and the hash browns were the best items I tasted. The omelettes were good but did not stand out from ones you would get anywhere else. Service was also good but they did not have Coke products which always annoys me.",

(Even President Obama approves.)  Believe it or not, until this past weekend, it had been at least a couple years since I last ate here. Not that I had a bad experience or anything. I'm just an impatient person and get intimidated by the line, which sometimes on weekends gets wrapped all the way around the block.  Decor inside has a nice, 50's diner throwback. Love checking out all the old black and white photos hanging on the walls.  My all-time favorites on the menu? Any of the hotcakes, but particularly the banana and chocolate chip. And lyonnaise potatoes, which comes as a side for most of the protein-based menu items.  However, this past weekend, while scanning the menu, I saw something new: Pittsburgh hash. Their lyonnaise potatoes mixed with kielbasa, sauerkraut and topped with Swiss cheese. It was a dream, and possibly the best meal I've eaten there. And that's saying a lot.  I think this breakfast is best after a hard workout. Makes the calories more justified. I've eaten here after a night out once or twice, but the meal's decadence was too much while nursing a hangover. Haha.",

    "text": "OMG OMG OMG. This place is not a game for breakfast.  I was in the 'burgh for a theatre gig at the CLO. As always, once I open a show, I have cravings for breakfast around noon. We heard amazing things about Pamela's so here I went.  The place is in the heart of the adorable Strip District; a part of Pittsburgh you have to visit when you go. You enter into a retro-40's/50's ambiance and the atmosphere is for people who dont need to be needy for a good hearty meal. Even if the sign says \"please wait to be seated,\" the waiters know that you want to sit where you pick.   My colleague and I sat down at a clean table, ordered from an AMAZING looking menue and seriously recieved our freshly cooked meals within 5 minutes. I'm really not kidding. It was hot and fresh and fast!  And the crepe pancakes.. oh. That crepe pancake; Breakfast Coma Heaven. My colleague's healthier choice of an egg white omelet w/spinach and onions and raisin bran toast was as even satisfying as it looked.  If you're looking for a FOR-REAL breakfast and not wanting to be bothered with an unnecessary, over the top, snooty brunch feeling, go have a FOR-REAL-GOOD time at Pamela's P&G Diner.   Service was friendly and they were definitely busy, but NEVER rude. I liked everyone in there. And the prices were amazingly cheap for the amount of happiness placed on your plate.  Delish.",

    "text": "Pamela's I have to go back, I ordered the Tex-Mex omelette and it was good, no concerns with flavoring, or the chorizo or the guacamole even. However it was a very thin teeny tiny omelette...  Maybe a half an inch thick with the filling and eggs included, So i knocked down a star for portion size only because it was an 8$ omelette. There was more food on my plate, but I wanted more omelette, less home fries you feel me?  The service is speedy, if they are busy it can feel a little rushed, but nice servers.   The decor is impossibly bobby socks, and poodle skirts adorable I half expected Rizzo and Sandy to pop out of the ladies room at any moment. Overall this is a yummy spot definately worth checking out.",

While my daughter and I stood at the doorway for 5 minutes, following the sign that clearly stated \"Please wait to be seated\", the man running the cash register barely acknowledged we were there.  I finally asked him if we could sit and he said we could sit wherever.  Our server, however, was nice and got our food out fast.    The food was okay.  Standard diner fare.  I wasn't in the mood for breakfast as we were well past lunch.  Perhaps I should have tried the famous crepe pancakes but alas I wanted a burger.",

    "text": "I'll start by saying that pancakes are one of my favorite things to eat. I was very excited to try Pamela's, the pancakes were highly rated in a variety of places.  The pancakes are very good, I actually said to my dining companion that I could eat them every day.  I had the strawberry hot cakes which are the traditional pancakes with fresh strawberries, sour cream and brown sugar rolled up tightly inside.  The foundation for good pancakes is the batter, the recipe at Pamela's is the right balance of ingredients therefore creating a pancake that is thin but still light and fluffy.   I also tried the lyonnaise potatoes and they taste very similar to the potatoes my grandma prepared for us as kids.  The potatoes taste like they're cooked with onions and spices. Lastly, I must comment on the chorizo hash, it's the lyonnaise potatoes tossed with tons of chorizo, another winner.  Strongly recommend",

    "text": "I came here on a Sunday around Noon.  Part of me says my experience may be skewed because of the busy time I visited, but, the former-server part of me says that if at this point you haven't figured out how to handle a rush, you never will.  A friend and I visited and were sat within 10 minutes.  The waitress came over in a few minutes and took our order.  Easy enough.  After that, we never saw her again.  A man with rubber gloves on served us our hotcakes and potatoes first.  A few minutes later i received my eggs and the check was also dropped off.  I realized right away that I needed more napkins and some hot sauce but our waitress never got within earshot.  I wasn't able to flag down anyone else so after 5 minutes I walked over, took a hot sauce from the counter and took some napkins from the server station where they roll silverware.  Good thing we didn't drink all of our water.  When we were done we took our check up to the counter.  I noticed a line item on our check under bacon that said \"WD .75\".  The girl behind the register didn't know what it was and she took it off.  My guess was that it meant \"Well Done $.75\".  I did ask for my bacon crispy, which it really wasn't and I was upset that I was going to be charged money to leave it on the griddle for another 30 seconds.  I wonder how many people they get with that one.  The food was ok.  It was diner food.  Nothing more, nothing less.  I did like the crepey-hotcakes but I remember them being cooked slightly less crispy last time which made them a bit more tasty.  My scrambled egg whites were sitting in water (which didn't help my bacon retain its mediocre crispiness).  For a better greasy spoon experience, I recommend Dor-Stop in Dormont or for a cafe experience I recommend Coca in Lawrenceville.",

The food is delicious, the service is excellent, prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere is fantastic!!  The chorizo, potatoes and pancakes (crepe style) were amazing and the best we've ever had.  Although not in our plans, we decided to delay our departure from Pittsburgh for the express purpose of returning to Pamela's the next day. Well worth it!! My only issue was that I wish I had a bigger appetite and/or more time to be able to sample their other menu items.  Unfortunately I live more than five hours away and I don't know when I'll get back to Pittsburgh - I may have to make a special trip just to have breakfast though!",

We had a decent sized group though and it was noon on Sunday so I don't know how indicative my experience was. But even the wait wasn't too long really. 20 minutes maybe.  I opted for the Tex-Mex omelet. it was very big and tasted great. It came with toast and lyonnase potatoes that I could eat all day. They were so damn good. Nobody at the table was disappointed with what they got. I had a couple bites of the pancakes and they were much approved. I was a little sad I was so full from my food that I couldn't have more of those.  They also serve lunch items (but not on Sundays) which I'm sure are good as well but why bother? Breakfast is where it is at.  Eating at Pamela's is a MUST. Damnit, now I'm hungry for more potatoes...",

They certainly are using that to their advantage, as well as the hip and high energy diner style restaurant. The rest of the food is average. I went there two mornings in a row, and tried to get a wide variety of their offerings. The corned beef hash is too salty and fatty. The homefries are too buttery and soft, but taste good because of all the butter. The eggs are below average, but the prices are quite reasonable and the food comes out really fast. I would recommend it, but stick with the crepe hotcakes!!!! JAI BABA",

I also had some eggs and toast.  And it's a lot.  I really could not finish my plate.  But the hotcakes were so yummy, a little crunchy and soft where it counted.  They were thin and filling, and cooked to perfection.  The eggs were seasoned to my tasting and I couldn't stop eating it.  I'm not a big breakfast person, because it's the same food with no twist, but this totally caught me off guard because it was so different from what I'm used to.  Definitely worth coming here!",

I liked the overall atmosphere of the place--lots of people, good food, bright indoor space, and nicely air-conditioned.  The food was very good, but very rich. The strawberry crepe/pancakes were delicious- if you don't mind lots of butter/oil (you can tell they've been fried in a lot of oil because they are crispy and very tasty). We ordered the crepes, the french toast and the scrambled eggs with scallion & cream cheese.  They Lyonnaise potatoes were excellent (and again, probably not so good for you).  Big portions and very reasonable prices makes for a busy diner.  A few things that could be improved: 1) their OJ is out of a machine-- doesn't taste sweet/fresh..reminds me of Donald Duck OJ.  2) We asked if we could order food for my friend's 2-year-old first as he needed to eat-- our waitress acted  a bit annoyed and confused (not a very difficult concept)..and of course, that specific order came out 10 minutes AFTER what we ordered! (I'm assuming there was confusion in the kitchen-- they were apologetic and nice about getting us the order quickly after realizing the error).   Overall, the waitstaff was very friendly, and we were seated very quickly (even though the place was crowded).. And-- we didn't realize it was cash only, and neither of us had cash on us, so they were nice enough to let us hold our tab until we came back to pay for it.",

    "text": "There is not much I can say about Pamela's that has not already been said but if you are reading this, just know that if you have not been to a Pamela's in Pittsburgh and have the opportunity, don't pass it up. In fact, this morning while eating a family sat next to us and the husband asked me, \"Is this place any good?\"  They were from out of town and visiting. I let them know that their decision to come here would not be regretted and that before moving to Pittsburgh myself, I use to drive over from NE Ohio a few times a year for it!  I may have also told them that Pamela's is the reason I moved to Pittsburgh!  After they ate, they said the thought I was joking but now weren't sure.  Known for their thin, crispy and large Hot Cakes, you may also want to try the specialty Hot Cakes that are more similar to crepes filled with fruits, creams and the sort. But don't let the deter you from trying their traditional breakfast offerings of eggs, bacon, sausage and of course the other famous Pamela's dish, Lyonnaise Potatoes.  They will cook your eggs to order but over easy is my favorite.  And don't overlook the Hash dishes either.  Corned Beef Hash and Chorizo Hash are two of my favorites.    Needless to say, I have a hard time picking what I want here! But today I think after all these years I finally found the perfect order that gives you the best bang for your buck along with variety so here it is:  Order the Morning After which gives you Two Eggs, Choice of Meat and 2 Hot Cakes for $8.95. Then, pay the up charge of $2 to make the Hot Cakes Specialty Hot Cakes of your choice (Banana Walnut hint hint ;) and finally an order of Lyonnaise Potatoes for $3.50. All that for under $15 and you have a taste of all the best here!  They will bring the Hot Cakes on a separate plate so if you are like me, you mix everything else up and have yourself a nice makeshift Hash.  Just a few final comments and you can be in your way to Pamela's but before you go, you need to know these two things. 1) Cash Only...I know I know, just go with it! 2) It's a popular place, especially in the weekend. You may have to wait but it is worth it. Hop inside and get your name on the list and enjoy some conversation with your friends and family until your table is ready.  I promise you, you will not regret it!",

Get there early on weekends, otherwise there's a line. It does move reasonably fast as they do a good job or turning tables.  Food: Their hash and hotcakes seem to be the two things that stand out the most. He had the Pittsburgh Hash - lyonnaise potatoes with chopped up kielbasa and sauerkraut topped with Swiss cheese. Delicious, especially with over easy eggs. I had the Morning After Special - basted eggs (do it!), sausage, and hotcakes. I upped the ante and got the specialty banana walnut hot cakes. Their hotcakes are thick and dense crepes. A wonderful crispy edge, and you can taste the butter it's cooked in.   Service: Decent. Orders are taken quickly, with food and drinks coming out as fast, even when they were busy on a Saturday. You won't get a check, but they'll leave your order chit on the table, which you'll then take to the register where they'll tally up what you owe.   Cost: One iced tea, a Pittsburgh Hash, a Morning After Special with the specialty hotcake added totaled about $24 after tax. Not bad!   Overall: Give it a try. They have several locations around Pittsburgh. Again, CAS",

I usually get the sausage breakfast sandwich with a side of the \"Famous Lyonnaise Potatoes\" and I would HIGHLY recommend the potatoes. It's a hash with onions and melty cheese, although it can sometimes be a bit on the salty side.  This time, I got the croissant french toast and it was heavenly. I would recommend splitting it because it's a little too sweet and rich with the caramel to be eating all of it on your own (but no shame if you do). It has the flakiness and layers of a croissant but a balanced denseness like a french toast. Honestly, not sure how I've gone so long without ever thinking of using croissants for french toast.  Pamela's is cash only so keep that in mind! but the staff is so friendly and they feel like a family and they always look so happy, which makes the experience that much better. Don't be discouraged if there's a wait and you have to put your name on the list because it honestly goes pretty quickly, and it's definitely worth the wait!",

I went with the veggie omelet and added jalapenos with wheat toast and potatoes on the side. The potatoes were amazinggggg. The omelette was good, but I expected the veggies to me fried into the eggs. Maybe I'm just a newbie with omelettes and didn't know any better.   My boyfriend got the hash and LOVED it. How can you not with all of that cheese melted on top!!   Overall, a very good experience. We had a attentive waitress who filled my water glass literally as soon as I needed it filled, it's like she could read my mind.   I will be back!",

On my second trip to Pittsburgh I came in and ordered the morning after breakfast special (pictured below). Not only was I in shock with my friend with how large the portion was for the cost, so was everyone around us. People kept asking what we got so they could order it too. I HIGHLY recommend you order that one. You won't regret it. You receive eggs prepared how you like them, choice of ham bacon or sausage, and two very large hot cakes.

    "text": "I visited P&G Pamela's Diner for brunch on Sunday afternoon. The line was out the door however the line moved very fast. The wait for 2 people was only about 25/30 mins despite the crazy line.  Also this restaurant is CASH ONLY.  I didn't see the cash only sign above the register until I got inside the restaurant so I had to run to PNC bank at the end of the block.   So I ordered the Mushroom and Cheese (I chose swiss) Omelet ($8.50) which came with toast and my choice of a side was Lyonnaise Potatoes. My meal okay. Typical diner quality. In my opinion it just lacked flavor and seasoning.  My boyfriend ordered the Chorizo Hash (~$9) with eggs and Tortillas. He enjoyed his meal and said it was flavorful.  Overall typical diner quality food, so if that's what you're into you will probably like P&G Diner more than I did.",

This place does it all well!   One star off for the eggs. I feel like they're great at all their superstar menu items that the most basic item, eggs, are just an afterthought. But eggs are the protagonist in the diner story, right? Sunny side up is not over easy. Maybe skip the eggs or temper your expectations that this diner is just special in other ways.",

They were really good and very thin. Lots of butter slathered on them; I had to scrap some of the butter off. I also tried the potatoes. They were seasoned well. They too were buttery. The turkey sausage was good, too.  I loved the throwback feel of the dining area. There were lots of pictures ad decorations from past eras.  They give you hearty servings of food. I wasn't able to eat all of my food, although I did try.  This is a great place to try if you're in Pittsburgh.",

The food was phenomenal. I ordered the chorizo hash with scrambled eggs and toast which was delicious. The only down side is how busy this restaurant is. After being seated our waiter said he'd be back to take our order and we did not see him for about another 20 minutes. The place was completely packed so it makes sense. Overall, great restaurant, great food, just make sure you have plenty of time if you're looking to eat here.",

I couldn't decide so I got the hot cakes & California French toast && it was the best we have ever had!!! You didn't even need syrup, it was that good. I did however put a little bit because I love syrup! My husband got the omelette I forgot which one, but the chorizo was good and the home fries were amazingly good!!!

    "text": "This unassuming greasy spoon located in the Strip District serves one of Pittsburgh's most popular breakfasts. Quaint as it is, P&G Pamela's Diner was bustling the Thursday morning I stopped in, filled with moms with toddlers, businessmen with suits, and seniors with newspapers.  Although the restaurant is nationally known for its pancakes, I didn't bring my sweet tooth to breakfast during my visit, and I instead ordered the \"Pittsburgh Hash,\" which featured crumbled kielbasa sausage, sauerkraut, Lyonnaise potatoes, onions, and melted Swiss cheese, with 2 eggs over easy and a side of toasted white bread smothered in half-melted butter. My setting was rounded out with a small OJ and coffee, the total damage coming to $14.82, cash-only. (Luckily I was carrying cash.)  Yes, the dish was a bit heavy, but I was delighted with the wee bit of tang and sweetness imparted by the sauerkraut, an essential component that brought the various ingredients of this hash together in a way that made it truly taste like Pittsburgh. That said, Pamela's Diner could adjust the portion size of this dish: even though I arrived with an empty stomach, I finished about half of the hash, half of my eggs, and half of my toast and was totally stuffed. I couldn't do any more despite that I felt this was one of my better-tasting breakfasts this year.  Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant for breakfast -- though it loses a Yelp star from me for its stubborn cash-only ways.  Food/Decor/Service: 4.0/3.2/3.6",

So I'm not really a pancake lover, but apparently their special hotcakes are great so I tried a bite and it was too buttery for me, but if that's your type of breakfast, you will be in heaven as there are several different hotcake options. I ordered an egg white omelet with veggies and wheat toast and everything was excellent. Bonus: They bring you an entire pot of coffee!   There's definitely something for everyone here and I highly recommend checking this place out if you find yourself hungry in Pittsburgh, but go before you're ravenous because there will be a wait.",

They may not have a vegan hippie rolling imported organic oats one at a time, or have yogurt cultured with bacteria scraped from the armpits of tibetan monks, but what they do have here is transcendent, albeit unconventional, pancakes at the top of a roster of magnificent diner fare. Those pancakes, a kind of sort of hybrid between flapjacks and crepes--let's call 'em Crepes 'Murican are crazy good straight with butter, or doused in maple syrup, or rolled up around berries and whipped creme. These may not be better than sex, but it's a close call and probably depends upon the company you keep. The pancakes come with bacon or sausage, in a portion that defeated me--a Casey Hampton-esque mountain of a man with an obsessive preoccupation for breakfast food. Maybe it was the the side of lyonnaise potatoes I shared with my companion--and don't be put off by the french name, those taters and just crazy good homefries, some onions tossed in for good measure, fried up in butter until crispy on the side and sumptuously fluffy between. There's a ton of other good stuff here, omelets to fit the taste and whims of a tourbus full of Belgian aristocrats, sausage and chorizo and a lot of other stuff I ignored because, you know, pancakes.  PANCAKES.  Now all and all, it is great that new places are opening and gaining traffic, but this business of Pamela's, with its hundreds of great reviews, showing up below the young pretenders, who've seen a dozen or two dozen reviews, will not stand. Pamela's is still the king--or Queen, if you will. Don't forget it.",

This is absolutely NOT one of them. No wonder President Obama digs them!  I am a mad hotcake fan here, as the banana chocolate chip are my all time favorite. Trying to be \"good\" I opted for a spinach and feta omelet. I realized there really was no being good, it was bad, but in the best possible way. Follow me?  I mean, I always love the sweet stuff rather than the savory for breakfast, so omelet's are fairly boring to me. But this omelet was seriously so tasty. The spinach was incredibly flavorful and the feta was the same. Great distribution. The eggs were crisp, but buttery. Not too buttery, but buttery enough that I knew this was no healthy option. Oh well, it was delicious! I threw caution to the wind...  On top of that it comes with two pieces of wheat toast and incredible Lyonnaise Potatoes, which I savored every. single. bite. of. I usually love crispy hashbrowns, but that isn't even a thought after biting into these taters.   If you have a chance, avoid the weekend crowd, take a day off and enjoy a leisurely breakfast here during the week. It's definitely not half as crowded as it usually is. You actually just seat yourself! So treat yo'self with a cheat day soon.",

It's crowded, a bit noisy and fun!  Our waitress was friendly and efficient.  The decor is 50s dinerish.   Now the food.... The definition of comfort food!  My hubby went with the Pittsburgh Hash (house special lyonnaisse potatoes with Polish sausage and sauerkraut with 2 eggs and toaat) ...

    "text": "Don't be intimidated by the line at Pamela's, it goes quickly, especially for groups of 4 and less. Food is reasonably priced, big portions and down right awesome... especially the home fries and chocolate banana stuffed hot stacks.  Decor is that of a family 50's diner and the staff are upbeat and helpful.    Reason for the 4 rating is due to the check out process. They give you the kitchen slip, which was barely legible for us and no where on the slip did it mention gratuity. You pay up front, not at your table and we had 3 couples, 3 kids so it was hard to slip checks because everything was lumped together, abbreviated and NO TOTAL. Was hard to see who owed what.  We also didn't know there was gratuity added so we ended up double tipping the server. Yes she was nice but she wasnt amazing. Our total bill was supposed to be $87 and we paid $112 before the extra tip we put down. So we had an unexpected $25 on the bill and put down an extra $25 for the tip we left.   Overall the check out process was very confusing and my husband was the one who paid. He wanted me to note that the  register is right near the door and is the busiest location in the place. He said everything was rushed and there was too much madness going around to get an explanation or itemize list of what was on the check.    The food as always was awesome but the end process left our entire group with a bad taste in their mouths. Every experience can be different but in ours this time we learned that this place is great if you are not splitting checks and not in a big group.",

It was already a long standing fixture, but definitely got pushed over the top by the executive visit a few years ago. As such, if you're not there before 9am on any given day, you could easily be standing in a line running down the street. Is it worth it? The place underneath all the tourist hype is a good old fashioned corner diner, with huge pancakes, black coffee and lots of fried meats. The place is very retro looking (original decor) which I like. Service was efficient, but definitely not friendly. If you can get there early enough, give it a try.",

The pot of coffee on the table was another source of joy. And the whole carb-tastic meal proved to truly be a breakfast of champions, as I was full for the rest of the day.  We visited on a weekday, so there was no wait, which was nice. I understand that the waits get long on the weekends, but I assure you that it's definitely worth the wait.

And when you order coffee, you get your own little warmer for quicker refills - a VERY nice touch.  This morning I ordered the veggie omelet with no tomatoes or mushrooms (they use canned mushrooms - not a big deal, but just not my preference), Italian toast, and the famous Lyonnaise potatoes. It was a perfect post-5k breakfast for sure. Although I didn't have their pancakes this morning, they are pretty incredible. You can also get some gourmet options with pancakes, my favorite being the chocolate chip banana crepes.   Seriously, you cannot go wrong here with anything you order.",

I am typically a savory breakfast eater, but reading about all these crispy buttery edges got me really excited to try something new.   I got the strawberry pancakes, which were two giant pancakes filled with fresh strawberries with a smidgen of sour cream and brown sugar.  Oy. Too rich. The first one went down easy, but the second was a serious struggle, and was left in pieces on the plate. Even at the inexpensive price of $6.95, I definitely recommend sharing.

Two cakes that were thin with crisp edges with a not too sweet buttery flavor. Perfect canvas for eggs, bacon, and syrup or sweeter add-ons like chocolate chips.

Nobody on either review page told us the opposite (to go to Deluca's over Pamela's).  We were not disappointed.  The breakfast menu is pretty basic.  I got the Tex Mex omelette.  The eggs were very fluffy, the bread was fresh and think, and the potatoes lived up to the hype.  My wife got the blueberry pancakes which were filled with fresh blueberries rather than gross blueberry compote.  The coffee was so so.  The waiters seemed rushed, and our waitress never checked on us even though she had downtime to talk to her colleagues behind the counter.  Several times we tried to flag her down for a refill, but she literally didn't even look at us to see if we were okay.

Their pancakes make me want to eat pancakes and I never eat pancakes.  Furthermore, their is no recipe posted online for their special pancakes.

It took a while for us to get coffee and utensils and for the waitperson to take our orders, which made me a little nervous.  But I'm telling you, once we did order, the food came out in NO TIME flat.  It was seriously fast.  Eggs were fine, bacon and sausage not very good, but the crepe-like pancakes were fabulous.  Worth the trip just for those.",

    "text": "(06/12/2011) Was told this was THE place for breakfast in the Burgh.  They do deliver the goods, and in large quantities.  I've never been much for sweets for breakfast, but when in Rome...the crepe-like hotcakes were sweet-salty, buttery, a touch of a metallic aftertaste (possibly a little too much leavening); love the crispy, lacy, browned edges.  The homemade corned beef hash was savory, salty, could taste the pickling spices the beef was braised in; the over easy eggs were perfectly oozy.  The famous Lyonnaise potatoes are probably famously made with a stick of butter; rich and tender.  Be forewarned, there is a long wait on the weekends, it's a popular spot for visitors and Romans alike.",

It was almost noon time and although the place was not full, there were people dining at several tables.

I was told it was a building safety drill check. I know these are necessary but not during business hours when people are there paying for a meal and are expecting good service. I practically swallowed my meal whole to get out of there. I can't imagine anyone enjoying their meal at all. Noone in there should have had to endure that.",

Or you can go a little later in the afternoon and get seated right away.   This place is so cute. Every time we're there, we find some new picture or kitschy item to smile about. And it is so consistent. You know you're going to get exactly what you order, exactly how you expect it, and every time we come for breakfast, it never changes.   The veggie and mushroom and cheese omelet are fantastic, huge and well-stuffed. Gail's Favorite Eggs are another great choice - who would have thought a dollop of cream cheese on scrambled eggs would be so amazing!? The lyonnaise potatoes are the superstar on the plate though. And I love that they serve your coffee in a huge carafe so you never have to wait for a refill!   The staff are always super friendly and welcoming, although they do get busy and it can be a wait on drink refills.   I can't say enough about how much I love this location!   Pamela's is cash-only. There is a PNC ATM right around the corner and a Citizen's Bank ATM a few blocks up Penn Ave.",

Even if you've never been a huge pancake fan, you absolutely have to try them, since they are a unique creation that's maybe 2/3 pancake and 1/3 crepe with crispy edges.  I've only had something like this at one other place in the Amana colonies in IA.  Maybe its a Mennonite thing?  The bacon was pretty lifeless, but the sausage links are really good, so I can't count them off any stars for that.

You have to try the 'Lyonnaise Potatoes' which is a classic! It is totally different that your regular side of Potatoes! You can order it with a twist of different toppings! I love the Chorizo with it, along with scrambled eggs! Yum! They close in the early afternoon (before 3pm), depending on the location; so be aware. Breakfast is available all day!

You pay about $7.95 a person for a very healthy portion that you won't be able to finish. The service is minimal, but efficient. It's the kind of place that you want to know your order before you sit down.   I had the Pittsburgh Hash because it was the special on the window and it sounded like it could cure a hangover. It did.   I've been to the Strip District Pamela's and the Squirrel Hill and they're both consistent and quality.   Get there early and avoid the long line.",

My brother and I get here around 11:30ish and we were told that the wait would be 15-20 minutes. Despite seeing the long line outside, we decided to wait. Since we were so hungry, we went to the donut shop next door and got some donuts. After finishing our donuts, we waited and waited until they finally called my name....after 40 minutes later. We didn't really mind since we were so hungry and I was dying to try their pancakes.   Our server greeted us fairly quickly and took our order and gave our drinks. The service was great but the food was just mediocre. I was really confused why this place was so popular.....there was nothing special about this place. Their famous \"crepe style pancakes\" were just regular pancakes. Their \"thick cut bacon\" wasn't really thick cut. Mid way through our brunch, I came to a conclusion that this is just regular diner food. Everything was just mediocre until....until....I went to the bathroom.   They only have 2 stalls and the bathroom is tiny and DISGUSTING to say the least. It smelled so horrible with tissues everywhere and the bathroom literally smells worst than a porta potty. The bathroom is basically the main reason I can't give this place 3 stars.   Next time I am in town, I want to visit again and hopefully, that time, I can honestly say this isn't just a mediocre diner.",

My husband and I took our twins to the Strip District location to enjoy some breakfast and get our before the snow/rain hit over this past weekend.    It was fairly early and the weather forecast was changing by the minute, so we had no problem parking even with most of Smallman Street being torn up for construction.    The restaurant wasn't crowded, so we picked a seat and were immediately greeted and offered drinks - I LOVE that they leave a carafe of coffee on the table!  Back to seating - if you have open choice, try to sit on the other side (follow signs for restrooms) or in the back - we were in the front half (not realizing there was another side) and froze every time the door opened!    The service at Pamela's was great - our kids split a meal and they served it on two separate plates, no questions asked.  Speaking of which, their pancakes were Pamela's perfection - the crepe style is unmatched in my opinion.  Just the right amount of fluff and crispiness.    As for the adults?  I had Gail's Favorite Eggs with the potatoes well-done and for the first time in a long time ate all my potatoes (I only like well done breakfast potatoes - these were crisped up and the salt level/seasoning was on point).  I also loved the addition of cream cheese and scallions to the eggs.  I'm not sure if it would have been better mixed in, but I did manage a bit in every bite by spreading the dollop out.  My husband had his go to - an omelet.  And he said it was a great one.  He loved his whole breakfast as well.   It wasn't the cheapest breakfast we've ever had, but it wasn't super expensive either, and we enjoyed it so much, I'm sure we'll be back again next time we're visiting da' Burgh.",

We got the Tex-Mex and Pamela's famous Strawberry Crepes. This is your typical American diner breakfast. Its heavy and made with a lot of butter. The Strawberry Crepes were good but its very heavy for one person. I couldn't finish my share of the pancakes because it was really buttery. The best parts of the crepes were definitely the end bits because  it was crispy. The middle part gets a bit soggy so it tastes and behaves more like a pancake.   I am glad I came and made a visit. It was definitely an experience of Pittsburgh diet and cuisine.",

This time we also ordered the chorizo to share and it was my favorite thing I have ordered so far. I would recommend trying this location if you enjoy their food but find it a hassle to go to the Shadyside location.",

There were lots of options but the corned beef and their signature breakfast potatoes are the stars in here. Also, the pancakes are thin crepe-like and super yummy with crispy edges. I also had the chorizo patties and they were good but overcooked. The coffee was a bit weak for me and the only sugar substitute they had was an off brand of sweet-n-low (ick!). Nevertheless, I would definitely come back. It was solid. Oh and heads up, this is a CASH ONLY establishment.",

There were many people waiting when we arrived but we waited only about 15 minutes for a table.  With so many people seated just ahead of us, there was a bit of a wait for the food but it was well worth it.    The star of the meal were the Lyonnaise potatoes - not quite home fries, these are some of the best I have had anywhere.  If you read any of my reviews, you know this is high praise as I judge all diners by their home fries!  My corned beef and swiss omelette was good and hubby said the Tex Mex was as well.  Next time I think I'll try the hash - they have several variations including Pittsburgh style with kielbasa and kraut.",

(mouth starts to drool and immediately dreams of the strawberry short cakes)   My family and I came here late morning to snag some breakfast but getting into the dinner was an adventure. Try planning out where you want to park prior to coming here. We drove around a few times to find parking and one of the roads nearby is under construction. Also side note be prepared to have cash! It is ESSENTIAL for parking and paying for your meal.   Once we figured out our parking situation we finally found made it to our destination!  When we entered inside we were seated immediately and were assisted right away. For our breakfast's we choose the Tex-Mex omlet, the morning after, veggie omelet, strawberry hot cakes, two bottomless coffees, and another hot cake. Wooowwzzaa our table wasn't big enough to handle all of these goodies but we made it happen with empty tummies. After  all was said and done our mission was complete. The strawberry hotcakes were our favorite and highly recommend anyone to try them!  Overall this is the spot! You needdddaaa try this spot ASAP!",

Although one of my hosts recommended the thin crepe like pancakes that Pamela's is known for, I opted for a more protein based breakfast as I had been making pancakes earlier that week. I ordered the eggs and chorio which was spicy and juicy. The star of my dish had to be the breakfast potatoes with chopped onions. I could eat that with some over easy eggs and oozing yolk all day every day as long as my body could accept it.  I had a bite of the pancakes and was definitely a fan with the thin crispiness and sweet strawberry topping.  Definitely a place to stop by in Pittsburgh on a weekend morning followed by a stroll or grocery trip on the Strip on a carefree weekend morning.",

Apparently he thought telling me that the President loves the pancakes there would be a selling point, and well... sure, I'll bite.  Walking up to the place, there was a huge crowd outside as well as inside. A packed diner is always a good sign, so we walked in and put our name on the list. They have a pretty good system going, where they have you sign in at the front counter, and a host has another list with him; once his list is finished he'll pick up the list on the counter, then they start a new list. It seemed pretty efficient in turning the tables over. We were told the wait would be about 25 minutes, but it flew by since we were able to people-watch and check out the yummy foods being served.  The menu is pretty standard for a diner - though I chose the chorizo and eggs, which was delicious. *Chorizo = a must-order.* They advertised their potatoes as \"lyonnaise\" which I have not a clue what it means, but they were really good too. I pretty much licked my plate clean when I was done. Ok maybe I didn't, but my plate was completely finished and I was a satisfied pig. There was several times when my friend and I laid back on our chairs and just moaned, in like the really full, content kind of way. If it wasn't for the 15 min walk back to the hotel I would have taken a nap right on the sidewalk.   If you love diners, and happen to be in Pittsburgh, check this place out.",

Instead, I went with two poached eggs, rye toast, and the famous potatoes. The food was decent--there was nothing \"wrong\" with it-- but it wasn't memorable at all. The food was pretty greasy as well, but that's to be expected for this kind of place. I sampled a bit of my friend's hotcakes and they were good but not great.

First of all the prices are right that is why you can only pay with cash.  Second you need to order only 2 things on the menu either the crepes  or the potatoes they are both awesome.  If you come here on the weekend you better come very early or you wait for a seat.  No problem it is worth a hundred waits.  It all depends also on the time of the year and the weather. I have waited for a seat that seemed like forever and then there has been Saturdays that I walked in and sat right down but to do so you must come.  I remember the last time the Steelers went to the Super Bowl and we ate here the Saturday before they had Steeler music going it was a great time.  They are only open for breakfast and lunch. I can't see them ever needing to be open later ever.  We are from Uniontown and go to the strip often throughout the year.  There has been other restaurants I have been wanting to eat at but can't get past this place.  The way this place is decorated like you are back in time with all the old photos on the wall and things makes you feel right at home.",

I had the chocolate (read: Nutella) banana hotcakes and they were excellent! I highly recommend them!  The service was nice and fast. The atmosphere is like a diner. The tables are close together, but somehow there still seems to be enough privacy.  I wish they served fresh-squeezed orange juice, but the hotcakes more than made up for its absense.",

I had Tex Mex Omelette with chorizo and it was awesome! Son had chocolate chip and banana hot cakes and it was even better (and I'm not a sweet breakfast eater). The chocolate was not too sweet which made for a great match with the bananas, no syrup necessary. I will definitely return on next trip to area. May even make up a reason to come back just for Pamela's. There wasn't a breakfast over $7. We went Tuesday at 1pm and were sat right away.",

I was visiting Pittsburgh to see my father who just moved there and had to convince him to go because the reviews seemed to be phenomenal and he was more interested in eating crepes.  When we arrived at the shadyside location, the waiting area was packed. To my surprise, we had a table within minutes. The waiter was there to take our order as soon as we sat down and we received our food in under ten minutes. I was amazed! If you're solely interested in fast service, then this is the place for you.  Otherwise, I'm still lost as to why this place is any better than any other breakfast place. The coffee was bitter and tasted like it had been sitting for awhile (mind you, it was 10am). I ordered the strawberry hotcakes which looked delicious but it was literally two thin pancakes with cold, sliced strawberries inside, a super sweet glaze and very little sour cream inside. As for the vegetarian omelet - the veggies inside were also cold and undercooked and the surrounding egg omelet was not seasoned. I could have made this myself even better. The potatoes, however, were probably my favorite part.   In a nutshell: Very basic breakfast  & nothing to write home about.",

Have 1 or 2 unconventional ingredients paired with some fun menu item names. This is definitely True for Pamela's Diner in the Strip District location.  It was 9:45am on a Sunday. I was not there by choice but out of necessity. While waiting for my kitty to finish getting her surgery, I needed a warm place to grab breakfast nearby. The cramped diner was completely full with a 3-page waiting list. Had I not seen the line DeLuca's already had at this time, I would've hightailed it out of there and gotten a no-fuss pho meal. But at least Pamela's had indoor waiting. At about 10:15am, we were seated at a wobbly table. Every piece of furniture had a slight layer of grease and was tiny.   I will say this--the service was very speedy and the food tasted great. I got the croissant French toast and sausage on the side. The toast was caramely and wonderful but kind of expensive for just bread. I was hardly full so had to order 3 measly sausages after that. Those turned out to be wrinkled and dry. Hubby ordered the Pittsburgh hash which was delicious and much more filling than mine.   Will I come back? Heavens no, there are too many choices to be made over this place. It's just greasy diner food, after all. Yummy? Yes, but hardly enough to stand waiting and count out cash for...",

We almost turned away. So I guess this will be one knock on the restaurant. There's not enough of it to accommodate the number of people who want to eat there! Luckily for us, a local across the street convinced us to wait it out. So we did. And boy were we happy we did!  Once inside, you'll have a fun time looking at all of the old pictures. If you need more reinforcement regarding the quality of food, just know that some pretty important people have eaten there! I ordered the Famous Hotcakes with ham and eggs on the side. My wife ordered the Chorizo Hash and Eggs. Both meals were absolutely amazing. If you get nothing else at this restaurant, try the hotcakes. They are to die for. I had plain hotcakes (which suited me just fine!) but I saw a lot of delicious-looking variety around me, so pick what strikes your fancy. The chorizo and hash was so unique and wonderfully flavored, with plenty of food on the plate to share.   The staff were extremely friendly (despite the chaotic and crazy atmosphere with so many folks waiting in line) and took the time to give us recommendations, even though they were very busy. We can't wait to visit Pittsburgh again just so we can come back to Pamela's and try different dishes!",

    "text": "I am salivating at the memory of the meal we had at Pamela's this weekend.  My husband and I were visiting Pittsburgh just to get out of dodge & numerous friends recommended Pamela's as a must-try spot. I'm thinking, \"when do multiple people recommend a breakfast place?\" and the answer is when it's absolutely amazing.  We took an uber because it was cold and rainy and when we pulled up we found that the diner was packed and people were waiting outside in the rain.  We were disappointed to find such a wait but then I realized.... people are standing outside in the rain waiting to eat here. It's just that good.  We joined the huddle for a good 30 or 40 minutes but the staff seemed to do a solid job of moving people in and out in a timely manner.  This doesn't seem like a good place to linger over coffee on a weekend but it is a place to get amazing food on the cheap.  Trust me, totally worth the wait, even in the rain.  My husband got The Morning After (two eggs, two choice of breakfast meat & the most amazing pancakes eveerrrrrr) and I got the chorizo hash.  The star of the show were the pancakes. They were reminiscent of the buttery-flavored pancakes I ate at McDonalds as a little girl. They were super thin and big as the plate but they somehow managed to be fluffy and absorb the syrup perfectly; not that they even needed much syrup.  I was guilty of stealing more than a few bites.  The chorizo hash was composed of potatoes, chorizo, jalapenos and onions smothered in the right amount of cheddar cheese. They serve up the hash with two eggs and tortillas which become the best damn breakfast tacos ever.  Yes, ever. I am usually not an absolutist but trust me on this.    Okay, I think that about covers it. Go eat there. Now. Or the next time you're in Pittsburgh. DO IT.  P.S. CASH ONLY",

    "text": "How do I even begin to describe my experience here? I've had such a positive one that I would even go as far to say that I'd come back to Pittsburgh just to go to Pamela's!   First to note: the GPS will actually lead you a little past Pamela's to a parking lot, which is actually great because you'll need to find parking anyways. It was actually at that parking lot that the guy manning the front told us to order the potatoes at Pamela's, which we did and they were AMAZINGLY GOOD.  I'm getting a little ahead of myself. The wait was about an hour for 4, but since we were only 2 people, we were told to check back in 30 min. We took that time to visit the Strip District, which is really lovely (chocolate, candy, free samples of cheesecake...). We were seated about 40 min after we put our names down, which is actually pretty good considering how busy it was.  Friend and I both ordered hotcakes with a side of the potatoes. SERIOUSLY SO GOOD. I'm craving it already! Crispy and slightly caramelized at the edges with delicious fillings- seriously you can't go wrong with the hotcakes.  And the the potatoes are so good- I still don't quite grasp what umami is but THESE POTATOES make me think of that description- so delicious that even when you're full, you'll keep eating. \"I don't think I can eat anymore\" was said as we stuffed our faces with the potatoes!  Easily the best brunch we've had here in our weekend trip to Pittsburgh. Like I said, I'd come back just for Pamela's. Amazing stuff right there!",

Once we were seated, service was super fast. I had the morning after breakfast. I chose egg whites, bacon, and the hot cakes. Super delicious, cleaned my plate. I was so hungry that I didn't even get pictures.   Can't wait to come back and visit and have some of the specialty hot cakes.",

You can beat the 50s diner style feel. Start to finish my experience was outstanding. Coffee and water didn't take long, and food was on point.   What we got: -Chrizo Hash (SO filling and comes with a side of toast)  -The Hangover (2 eggs, bacon, and 2 famous pancakes)   The pancakes are THE BEST I've had EVER. They're light, fluffy, and HUGE. I was so full, but could def put back another order. Also, this joint is cash only. Don't forget to hit an ATM before you put your name in. Will 100% be back for the pancakes and other delicious items on the menu.",

I typically get the Gail's favorite eggs EVERYTIME, but I ventured to the chorizo hash this time and may have a new favorite. You truly can't go wrong here.

The interior is bright, with tons of history of the walls. The menu is very straight forward, your usual diner items. Pamela's is known for their crepe style hotcakes, however.   I decided to get the chorizo hash, with two eggs any style and wheat toast. My boyfriend had the croissant French toast with caramel and nuts, accompanied by 2 turkey sausage patties and 2 eggs. Everything was tasty, especially the hash which was cheesy and filling with the lyonnaise potatoes. The only issue were the eggs. I ordered my eggs poached and my boyfriend ordered his over-medium..however we had the exact same eggs. Mine were over-easy which is not the same as poached despite the yolk being runny. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the base of our meals and won't hold it against Pam. We will be back if ever in town! Oh yea, service was speedy and friendly.",

The hotcakes, AKA pancakes, are the best on earth. Not like any you've had before, and each serving is one of the greatest things you'll ever taste. Especially from traditional American Cuisine.  It's a huge greasy delicious concoction of perfection, filled with blueberries, cream, deliciousness and heaven all blended together. It rocks my world beyond belief, but more to the point, it will rock yours. Every single person I have taken here has fallen madly in love with these Blueberry Hotcakes.  Top 3 must-try in Pitt! I don't say that lightly, as there are some great things here in the Pitt, but it's so unique and so incredible that you just must.  Some of the things I recommend are spicy or ethnic or unusual, and might not be to your taste if you prefer more traditional American crap, aren't adventurous, can't handle spice, prefer fake versions of foreign cuisines, etc (which applies to most Americans, sadly). But this one is absolutely universally amazing and almost everyone that tries it is going to fall madly in love so get here and give it a try. It's not even expensive either. Then again, neither is your girlfriend. I would know.  Bear in mind that I don't even like pancakes, so this is a ringing endorsement from a nonbeliever - the hotcakes here are the best type of pancake available in North America by a long distance. I thought nothing in the US could compare to Scandinavian style in Thunder Bay, Amsterdam ones, and best of all British style which I have never tasted outside homemade pans in England - those are my fave of all. But Pamela's wins North American pancakes and they win it well. Come here and see why.  If Pamela's was standard for US pancakes, I would adore pancakes in the US too. They're nothing like anything that you had before. They're burned and crispy at the edges, they're soft and gooey and wet in the middle, and they are absolutely delightful. Every bite is pure perfection. You will never have I better pancake them this. The blueberry one is the ultimate because it has perfect taste from the creamy stuff to the fruit to the dough.  This is one of those places that everybody has to try. Everybody I've ever told about this place fell in love with it. Girls in particular become obsessed with it, but to be honest I don't think there's a living human being who wouldn't love these hotcakes. I repeat myself because it bears repeating. Sort of like when Grizzlies are having sex with each other and reproducing (Bears Repeating).  I cannot emphasize enough how quickly you need to try these. This is from someone that has been to 10,000 places around the country. So get on with it.  So whether you're old, Middle Aged, or a Minor You'll wanna make out with this pancake designer There is no better cake Than this here one they bake The Blueberry Hotcake at Pamela's P & G Diner!  Your first bite will tell you that there's no pancake finer You'll love it more than Barbie loves high heels and eyeliner And when you're done eating You'll stay there on the seating And order another from Pamela's P & G Diner!  Touch Barbie without asking her, I'll give you a shiner Barbie + these hotcakes - what could be diviner I've tried all things in Pitt And this is really IT Come and get a hotcake at Pamela's P & G Diner!  When they close early it turns me into a whiner They're almost as beloved as my gf's pantyliner So eat, drink, and be merry With a hotcake - Blueberry And make sure you get it from Pamela's P & G Diner!

If you're looking for a hearty breakfast after a night out in the city, I definitely recommend Pamela's. Strawberry hotcakes are great and the croissant French toast is an untraditional twist on the breakfast classic that Pamela's executes so well! The omelets seem great, but the only one I actually like is the chorizo. They tend to be watery and slimy and the contents aren't cooked all the way. Other than that, it is a colorful, fun, exceptional breakfast joint in a very convenient location at the end of the Strip.",

There was a bit of a wait (45 minutes) but we arrived around 11 on a Sunday for a party of 5, so this wasn't too bad in my opinion and to be expected!  Wait staff was really friendly.

Their business card claims that Pamela's is the best breakfast in Pittsburgh; I might dispute that, preferring: Best Breakfast in Pennsylvania or Best Breakfast on the East Coast or Best Breakfast in North America or...well, you get the point. Everything about Pamela's fits neatly into the Utopian breakfast experience: the perfectly rolled Banana and Chocolate Chip Hotcakes, plenty of good, hot coffee, the Lyonaise Potatoes (homefries), the well-lit pink and blue artificial-fifties interior decorated neatly with retro-ish photographs and the pleasant service that rivals that of any diner I've ever been to. So, if you've yet to venture on down to the Strip for an epic breakfast at the newest Pamela's location, I plead with you to make your way down there... as fast as humanly possible.",

The potatoes could launch a thousand ships--I love mixing them all up with two overeasy eggs and plenty of ketchup and dipping in a thick buttered slice of Italian toast from the bakery just down the road. Meanwhile, I steal pinches off of my wife's strawberry hotcakes (crepes style)--the crispy deep fried edges are a party for your mouth.   You'll have a short wait if you come on the weekend--but service is snappy and plates land on your table in 10 minutes flat.   You'll get similar fare at each location, but I've experienced some mess-ups at the Mt Lebo location (which truly feels like an outpost--austere boxy room crammed with tables). Lipstick on the water glass (no biggie--it happens) and plastic wrap in my omelette (unpleasant in the mouth). Both these incidents occurred on the same visit, so I will chalk it up to an off day for a newer restaurant. Anyway, they gave us a fee meal on our next visit, but I'd stick to the Strip if you have a choice.",

Our waitress seemed a little harried due to the throng of hungry breakfast-goers but managed to be pleasant. I wouldn't arrive much later than we did though, it got even busier as the morning went on.  I had raved about the hotcakes to my fellow visitors but everyone else enjoyed their omelets and toast. At least one of us joked about clogged arteries, but we weren't expecting anything otherwise (or less delicious).   Added bonuses about this particular Pamela's are that you can peruse the Strip District before and/or after you eat, or grab coffee at 21st Street Coffee since the kind they serve at Pamela's is meh at best.",

I'm not a huge fan of chorizo but he really enjoyed it.   I ordred their speciality crepes which are I was not pleased with. I didn't like them at all as they were too thick and not at all like crepes. I did have turkey sausage (which only come in patties) and a single scrambled egg which may have been the best egg ever.

    "text": "Good, but nothing to write home about.  The huge wait baffles me.  I'd get it if the food was really good or if the service was better, but this place is just mediocre.  (...And it's better than the other location I've been to, in Squirrel Hill.)  The hash browns are excellent, but everything else was just okay.  My chorizo was overcooked into hockey pucks, and my eggs were a little tasteless and came out medium after I ordered them dry.  (I also had to wait five minutes after my friends got their food for my plate to come out.)  The crepes were okay - a little overdone and chewy, and my friends said their omelettes weren't very good.  Our waitress was nice, but never really checked in on us after our food was served, thus my five minute wait for my food.  Pamela's is another PGH institution that doesn't take credit cards, too.  Did anyone wake this city up after New Year's Eve 1993?  I think they might still be sleeping one off, because it's really hard to find restaurants in the other cities I've lived in that don't take credit cards.  (...And the pessimist in me still thinks all these little places are tax cheats and don't want the easy audit trails that come with credit cards.)  The hash browns are definitely winners, but everything else is about 2 stars.",

    "text": "Although we had recommendations from a friend to go to another place for brunch, we decided to try Pamela's when we saw that they had four stars on Yelp and there was a HUGE line on the street waiting to get in.   First things first, if you are thinking about going here: They are cash only. There's a PNC bank with an ATM machine right around the corner on Penn Ave if you, like us, don't normally carry cash. Then, even if there's a huge line, go inside right away and put your name in the waiting list. We waited a good ten minutes in line before realizing that the line was meaningless - you really need to have your name in the list, and then go outside and wait. The line goes pretty fast, though, so don't get intimidated by the size of it.  Our son had a feta and spinach omelet and loved it (another AWESOME). I had a veggie and feta omelet, and my husband the ham and cheese. Our omelets were OK - nothing to rave about it like our son was doing about his spinach and feta. And the omelets were kind of tiny, especially when compared with the amount of potatoes that are served in the plate. I did wish the omelet was the star and \"kind of the plate\", not the potatoes and toast. Looks like their strength is in the carb world, after all. My son and I also tried the hotcakes - my first time having it and they were worth every single second of stomach pain the gluten gave me after eating a few bites. The outskirts of the cakes were really crunchy like a waffle cone, and the inside is a thin, light pancake. Really good! I just couldn't eat a lot not only because of the gluten, but also because of the guilt - they are NOT a diet food. VERY buttery, but what else would you expect of them, right? As I told my husband, they taste like the ultimate winter breakfast comfort food. I can only imagine a really cold morning, freshly brewed coffee, and hotcakes. Yum!   And talking about coffee, theirs was really good. Not too strong and not bitter at all, just the way I like it. The waitress eventually left a carafe of decaf for me at the table, which I really appreciated, because their mugs are kind of tiny.   Final thing to be aware: When we were done eating we waited forever for the check to come (our waitress could have been a bit less absent...). When we finally asked the waitress for the check, she told us with a \"this is the most natural thing in the world\"  face that the check had been delivered with our food a long time ago. How come we didn't think of that, right? We really didn't see the check among the 300 other things in the table. So if you are not from the area and don't know how things work over there, bring cash, put your name in the list, and keep an eye out for the check which comes WITH your food.  Three stars because I didn't think that the breakfast was that awesome. Probably would think otherwise if I knew their system, ate gluten, and wasn't aware of carbs.",

It is cash only and the check they give you is not the easiest to decipher. I wasn't sure how much we owed until we got to the register. The location seems cute, but we didn't have time to walk around. If I'm ever back in Pitt, I would definitely stop back.",

Breakfast has long been my favorite meal of the day--I can't live without it and I'm cranky when I don't eat something more substantial than cereal or a muffin. That being said, I demand a lot from my breakfast restaurants, and I'd be willing to say that Pamela's is my current favorite for BEST BREAKFAST EVER! Strong statement, but a very strong contender.   I went here with a group of 3 at 9:30am on a weekday, so it was easy to get seated and the staff was efficient. We immediately asked our waiter for recommendations so that we could all share the best stuff on the menu, and he was dead-on with all of the items. We got:  Strawberry Crepe Hotcakes--hands down the best pancakes I've ever had.  Tex Mex Omelet with Chorizo--delicious!  Egg White with a side of Ham and Lyonnaise potatoes--perfectly cooked eggs, amazing homemade ham, and the Lyonnaise potatoes were exactly what breakfast potatoes should be: well-seasoned, a balance of moist and crunchy, and not just an afterthought.  I wish that Pittsburgh was not so far away so I could enjoy Pamela's more often, but rest assured I'll be stopping by any time I'm back!",

The crepe style pancakes stuffed with blueberries were just delectable (they are served with whipped cream that we asked to be left off ).  The Mexican style omelet (is anything better than Mexican?  I don't think so!) with chorizo is one of the best things I've had.  Yummmmmmeeeee!  And, Pamela's is in the Strip, a wonderful collection of ethnic markets, bakeries, and other stores in the shadows of Pittsburgh's central business district.  This is a do not miss if you are passing through Pittsburgh or if you live there.  BTW, Pittsburgh has kind of a bad rep ... I really liked it.  Good museums, pretty campi to walk around (Pitt, CMU) if you like visiting colleges (which I do), a fairly vibrant Downtown, charming Squirrel Hill, lots of restaurants to choose from, etc.  About an hour away to the south is the Laurel Highlands that features two Frank Lloyd Wright houses, Falling Water and Kentuck-Knob; rafting on the Ohio Pyle/Youghigeny Rivers, biking on the rivers' side trails, and beautiful scenery.  Definitely worth a day or two in Western PA.",

However, as a Pittsburgh institution, it is often terribly crowded, especially the location in the Strip District. This location is definitely lacking in acoustics and is often quite loud and chaotic. The hotcakes, however, are excellent, as are the potatoes. My favorite are the strawberry hotcakes, which are filled with fresh strawberries (none of that preserved stuff), sour cream, and brown sugar. Delicious! I've also enjoyed the banana hotcakes. The coffee is lackluster, but it's a diner, so I wasn't too disappointed.  This location only takes cash, but there's a PNC ATM right around the corner on Penn, so it's not too much of a problem (provided that you are a PNC customer).",

I went with my diner \"usual\" of egg-cheese-veg omelet and toast (YUMMMM), and he had the banana chocolate chip pancakes (sweet, but not too, chocolate, but not too much, and the OMG whipped cream...can I just get some of that, please?). Both washed down with coffee (you get your own mini-pot at the table for those who chug with their breakfast), and water (which was frequently refilled, also good for the morning recovery). This isn't your typical \"greasy spoon\" place...instead, brighter (read lots of pink and other happy colors), kinder, and overall, a pleasant experience.

    "text": "I had breakfast here a couple weeks ago on a sunday around 1030 am.  The weather was nice and the line wasn't that long I thought.  I think we waited about 20 minutes.  This was my first visit to this location and I can say that this location is probably my favorite.  I like the art deco feel and all the old pictures on the wall and I find this location especially \"bright\".  Here's what I really like about Pamelas.  I like the fact that you get your own pot of coffee on your table.  I like that the staff always seems friendly.  I think there pancakes are my favorite in the city.  I'm old school, so I don't throw on any whipped cream or other accompaniments (sp?).  I like just butter and tons of syrup.  I am not a fan of really fluffy or really thin (crepe) pancakes. I'd describe these as \"crepe like\" finding the perfect balance for me.  I also like the crispy edges on the pancakes.  I like that the orange juice is served in an adult size glass.  Now, they should improve on the following right away.  The bacon is crap... I mean worse than the stuff you get on your bacon egg n cheese biscuit at mickey d's.  They don't do poached eggs (my favorite).  They don't have skim milk (I know it's like ordering diet coke with a whopper, but I gotta save calories somewhere)    I ordered the \"morning after\", which is two pancakes (delish), bacon (next time I'll get ham or sausage) and two eggs (no poacching as previously mentioend) and a side of corned beef hash.  I was very pleased with this.  It almsot tasted dare I say healthy.  It wasn't smashed up corned beefish type out of a can.  It was good quality corned beef diced with perfectly crisped not soggy hash browns.  Annie got a cheese omelet that was huuuuge (a la paris hilton's new saying).  She said it was great and certainly looked very good, however I simply couldn't bring myself to try it.  Don't forget they only take CASH.",

We came into Pamelas on a Saturday morning and had a bit of a wait at the crowded entrance. We waited about 10 minutes and were quickly seated with an efficient waitress.  When our food arrived I think we died and went to heaven right then and there. I'm writing this review from the Great Beyond.  My husband had the corned beef hash, which I tried and actually enjoyed even though I usually hate corned beef hash.  And me? Oh, I had a plate of wonderful. Strawberry hotcakes.  Biting into one of these is like an epiphany. After all this time, all these years of consuming mushy pancakes with generic syrup, I had the epiphany of truth: this is what breakfast should be.  The hotcakes are somewhere between a pancake and a crepe, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Rolled inside were strawberries, cream, and brown sugar. And somehow, even though the serving is gigantic, there is a tinge of sadness, even heartbreak, when it's over. In such a simple meal, I found culinary prowess, peace, and God.",

This resto is huge and they turn tables quickly.   Loved the decor.  Loved the colors.  Loved the atmosphere.  LOVED THE CREPE HOTCAKES.   What is a crepe hotcake? Exactly like it sounds, a thinner pancake, a thick crepe? Somewhere in between crisped up on the edges served either plain with butter and syrup or rolled with fruit and cream cheese. We got the fresh strawberry ones, and I thought serving it with cream cheese would be heavy but it totally wasn't. The strawberries are fresh and not the weird syrup stuff. Overall I can't stop thinking about how unusual and delicious this dish was. Highly recommend!   We also got scrambled eggs with chives and sour cream in them, something I wouldn't normally get, and we devoured this plate. The eggs were the fluffiest, best texture I have ever had. I don't know how they did this!   Take a walk while you wait down the strip, this spot is not to be missed!!!",

As usual, I ordered the strawberry hotcakes (the best ones on the menu IMO!) and my dad followed suit.  The serving was a bit smaller than I remember, but the strawberries tasted deliciously fresh and the hot cakes were warm and fluffy with a crisp crust.  My only suggestion is that the cinnamon could have been a little heavier and more evenly applied.  My side order of lyonnaise potatoes were as perfect as usual - a generous amount of creamy, onion-packed goodness - YUM!  My mom ordered the cheeseburger, and ate more of it than I ever see her eat - indicating it was as tasty as it looked.  I also sampled her fries - which were fantastic - crispy and full of flavor.  My dad gave a big thumbs up to everything as he helped clear anything we couldn't finish.  All in all, Pamela's is TOTALLY worth going out of your way to visit!  Absolutely my favorite breakfast place of any in DC or PA!",

I have had plenty of early morning grub but most of my experiences were average.  It is not hard to scramble a few eggs, fry some bacon, and mash some hashbrowns.     Pamela's Diner is now at the top of my list for breakfast.  Along with the Obama-approved hot cake, I had eggs, sausage and toast.  My friend's waffle, omelet, and potatoes were good as well.  This Pamela's location is cash only and parking can be hard to find in this district.  The atmosphere is lively and fun.  The waitress to customer ratio is high.  The wait can be long during peak hours.",

    "text": "Their recipes are well guarded, the restaurant world famous, the chain ever expanding, and they even cooked for the President at The White House - clearly a visit to Pamela's was on the agenda for our trip to Pittsburgh.  Arriving on the strip around 8:00am and finding meter parking for a mere 50 cents we made our way from the car, hit the ATM (cash only at Pamela's) and entered the restaurant to find it just under 1/2 full.  Invited by a friendly young woman to seat ourselves we opted for a booth along the wall and sat for a moment absorbing the kitsch...vinyl furniture, plastic menus, stone walls, and random photographs of celebrities past and present.  Opening the menus and blatantly skipping all the boring eggs, bacon, and ham our waitress appeared to fill drink orders.  With only sweet n' low and sugar available for the coffee I opted to stick with water while my mom chose coffee and my sister selected tea.  Drinks delivered, including full pitchers of each to put the diner on refill duty, we placed our orders and browsed the lively restaurant while listening to the sounds of classic tunes overhead.  Founded in 1980 Pamela's certainly appeared older than its stated age, but it worked.  Waiting less than fifteen minutes our waitress checked in on us to be sure nothing else was needed and to let us know our food would be right out...after watching our neighbors receive their options I have to admit I was quite excited...and without fail the food arrived moments later, piping hot from the griddle.  With each of us selecting a different item and each plate large in portion and ample in flavor there was much sharing to be done.  Beginning first with my selection, perhaps Pamela's most famous option, I opted for the Strawberry Hotcakes.  Served in Pamela's famous crepe style the hotcakes themselves were divine.  Yeasty and soft yet caramelized and crisp around the circumference the pancakes themselves were stunning.  More impressive yet, ordered in the peak of strawberry season, the cakes were absolutely stuffed with super sweet fresh strawberries, brown sugar, and a zippy sour cream then topped with whipped cream.  Adding a touch of syrup (unfortunately not pure maple) the whole plate came alive - really, the dish made a fantastic breakfast but could have just as easily been served as dessert.  Following my lead and going with the signature hotcakes my mother received two enormous cakes absolutely crammed with hot bananas, bittersweet chocolate chips, and packed with whipped cream.  Nicely caramelized and crispy along the edges I sensed more of the yeasty and buttery nature of the batter in her batch and also perhaps the scent of nutmeg - I think it was in the batter, but perhaps it was the bananas - either way, it was excellent.  Figuring she would get plenty of opportunity to taste the pancakes my sister opted to try Pamela's French Toast - specifically the Croissant French Toast featuring two split house made croissants soaked in cinnamon-vanilla egg batter and topped with caramel sauce and nuts.  In order to understand how sweet this was you'd have to know my sister - the lady puts syrup on nearly anything that can be consumed for breakfast...and after her first bite she stated \"wow, this doesn't even need syrup!\"  With Buttery croissants nicely pan crisped, crunchy oven roasted almonds and walnuts, and decadent caramel syrup the best way to describe the dish would be a deconstructed cinnamon roll, but better.  Settling the modest bill and leaving an ample tip we left Pamela's very content and with blood sugar certainly well above fasting levels - the total duration of our meal was only 45 minutes but it actually felt much longer and not at all rushed.  Pleasant service, a nice setting, and a wonderful (albeit limited) menu I only wish Pamela's would offer some alternative sweeteners and a better brand of syrup...with those minor tweaks a great breakfast could have easily been in consideration for one of the best ever.",

A former alum, my other niece recommended that we go there. The food was great. I had a light meal, turkey sausage on a cheese egg sandwich. It was good and hit the spot. The fish sandwich was huge and easily served two along with the hash browns. I would have loved to have had the pancakes but I would have had to nap after those. Maybe next time! The service was great and remember it's cash only! Till next time!",

Sure, you might run across one ever once in a while.... but you just don't see them like you do in PA.  I miss that.  So, stopping by for a good breakfast was a must on my trip to Pittsburgh.   As you would expect at a diner, everything was quick, efficient and without unneccessary flourish.  Get in, order, eat, pay the lady up front, see you next time.  I knew that going in.  Some folks expect to be talked to.... to get the specials of the day and ask what's good.  This probably isn't the place for that.   I ordered the chorizo and eggs, and my wife got the banana walnut hotcakes.  My wife loved her meal, and mine was exactly what the doctor ordered!  It was the fuel needed for that long drive back to DC.   While a meal at a \"greasy spoon\" isn't for everyone, if you are in the mood, this is a great place to go.   Highly recommend!",

    "text": "Dear Pamela,  Thank you for providing a top notch breakfast and for serving the best potatoes in existence. This is not an exaggeration.  Your potatoes are creamy, flavorful and perfectly salted with the right amount of butter and perfectly cooked.  I enjoyed your Banana Chocolate Chip Hotcakes for my breakfast entree and I enjoyed them. They are unique in that the cake is thin, light and fluffy and with crispy edges. This is a different pancake experience and I rather enjoyed it!    Your atmosphere is fun and nostalgic and you do not offer a credit card option, which I understand and I'm glad that you give plenty of warning with your many signs.  Your T-Shirts are funny and for purchase and I like that too!  I hope that you continue to do well and I want the recipe for your potatoes! Until next time. Thank you for a great morning and I hope to visit again!  From a breakfast potato lover,  ***Breakfast Breakdown*** The food: The hotcakes were pretty good. I prefer a thicker pancake but if you're looking for something different give them a shot! Definitely steal someone's potatoes if you get the hotcakes. The value:  $7ish for hotcakes? Not too shabby since you get a lot of food! The experience: Fun! I liked it! Would I return?: Yes and I'd get an omelet next time. 4 stars?: The hotcakes didn't completely wow me, but damn are those some mighty delicious potatoes! Bring it on!",

I always get the chocolate chip banana hot cakes and I have never had hot cakes so thin and light but so indulgent at the same time. Order the whipped cream on the side-it's a a rush of sugary goodness otherwise. But that's not always a bad thing. Their coffee is good too. Service is usually slow and not the friendliest but this is one of those places where the wait is so long they want to get you in and out as quickly as possible.

    "text": "When I came to P&G, I was super curious about these mysterious crepe hotcakes - they were all over the menu, but there was no description! Unfortunately, the only way to really get them was stuffed with cream, strawberries/blueberries/fruit, and loads of sugar. Soooo I decided on the only savory option with crepe hotcakes - the Morning After.    I suppose this brunch could be for a Morning After a very uneventful, humdrum night. The dish consists of eggs, a short stack of crepe hotcakes, and your choice of meat - bacon, sausage, or ham.  Now, I'm usually not one to  clamor for quantity, but my sausage links had a good 5 inches of empty plate to roll around in, and my scrambled eggs took up maybe 1/3 of the rest of the plate. Alas, quality was lacking as well. The sausages might have come from a Jimmy Dean box, and the eggs were about half a step above airplane fare - bland in color, taste, texture, and generally lukewarm.   The crepe hotcakes came on a separate plate and the best way to describe them is basically crepes cooked like pancakes. And now I realize maybe that's why they're simply printed as crepe hotcakes without a description on the menu. Duh/doh. The texture of the edges was nice and crisp and it came with a little pat of butter. Otherwise, there wasn't much to distinguish this from a regular pancake.   I wanted a Morning After that would help me get through the shenanigans of a wedding. I'm not sure P&G's Morning After could convince me to get out of bed even on a regular day. And this is coming from somebody who's usually too lazy to grab a granola bar for breakfast.",

We didn't have to wait for a table, and someone came to take our drink & food orders very quickly. We decided to each get eggs, meat and the hot cakes, which were so large, we could have shared them. My mom got the regular hot cakes and I got the blueberry ones (highly recommend). I wish I lived closer, I'd definitely come back. They're cash only though, so come prepared.",

I would wait in line for an hour for this place if I had to.  On a Sunday around 11am for 3 people, the wait was 25-30 minutes. It really wasn't bad at all!  I got The Morning After Breakfast Special because I like a bit of everything in one meal. The \"hot cakes\" are to die for! I've never had them like that before! For my choice of meat, I got the bacon (oh man it was delicious) while my friend got the sausage link which wasn't anything special. My husband got the Tex Mex Omelette which was soooo good!  I can't wait to come back here and wait in line again for this totally delicious meal. If you live in Pittsburgh or are just visiting, you can't miss this place!",

    "text": "I made the dire mistake of making my way to P&G's during Mother's Day. That was MY mistake. But I had walked from my hotel downtown and was on my own, I wasn't about to turn around. Not to mention my short stay in Pittsburgh wasn't going to allow me to come back another day. So, with the hopes that being on my own would play to my advantage, I went in. And, it did. The very unenthused hostess informed me that I could wait for a spot at the bar and, after staring intently at the bar, willing people to hurry up, I only waited about a half hour before getting myself a seat on Mother's Day! I knew from the get-go that the pancakes were happening for me. In fact, P&G's only popped up on my radar after I checked Yelp for the best place in Pittsburgh to get pancakes. But after seeing an order of hash pass by me, I had to order a side of that too. So I got a short stack of pancakes, strawberries on top (I felt like the stuffed pancakes would be just a little TOO much for me) and a side of that yummy looking hash.  As always, fellow Yelpers led me to the best place. These pancakes were more like crepes in consistency, thin, buttery and crispy on the outside and yet... somehow maintained it's pancake-y taste. Definitely quenched the craving. The hash was the perfect salty antithesis to the sweetness of the pancakes, not something I would order on its own, but somehow worked as a side to the buttery star of the show.  Yet, only 3 stars? That's largely due to the service. From beginning to end, the service was non-existent. The girl at the counter seemed bored, the girl at the bar (where I sat) seemed annoyed, and the plethora of servers who came back there to get coffee or waters for their tables just appeared hurried, not approachable AT ALL. In fact, when it came time for asking for my water to be refilled (after patiently waiting at least 15 minutes with nobody noticing my glass had been empty), the girl I asked made it seem like it was completely inconvenient for her to do so. The ONLY person in that entire building who seemed like he was happy was the man clearing plates, dancing to his own tune as he was doing so, and put a smile on my face too. It's too bad the rest of them didn't take after this guy. I always find it so unfortunate when a great place, with great food become less attractive because of the people that work there. Service matters, darlings, take note.",

Of course, an honorable mention to the famous corned beef hash and eggs.  More a traditional dish, I prefer it served extra well done with grilled onions.  Spoon some on a long wheat toast slice, place a piece of egg with its runny yellow yolk, a dash of hot sauce and take a bite.  Now that's what I am talking about, see??!

    "text": "Pamela's certainly exceeded expectations, especially when we had heard that the food was delicious but the wait was long and the space small. We dined here on a Sunday morning around 9:30 or so, and we waited for maybe 20 minutes for a table (which is how long you might wait for your own reservation in New York...); the eatery isn't tremendous, but it was larger than I expected. The service was fast and efficient, and the menu options abundant.  My blueberry hotcakes (Crepe style!) were prodigious and filling. Two came with the order, and I could not even finish them--which is not a problem that I tend to have. I took off a star because the hotcakes are advertised as \"[s]tuffed with blueberries, brown sugar, sour cream & topped with whipped cream.\" Mine were definitely not \"stuffed\" as I didn't taste much brown sugar, and the crepes had only a little bit of sour cream at the ends.",

I had some of her french toast, and yes it was dripped in butter, but damn, thank you mam, so good.   I love Pamela's and the Strip is my favorite location. Not the best for little, little kids, but it's very family-friendly. If you go on a Sunday in fall, best to double check the Steelers schedule, home games will make the strip a nightmare.",

The taste was delicious but the style of cake may not be to everyone's liking. I had the Tex-Mex omelet and hubby had the Morning After. Very generous portions and tasty as well.  I would have given 5 stars but the coffee was pretty bitter and not very hot. They serve it in insulated pitchers left at your table for self serve refills. Perhaps ours has been brewed much earlier and wasn't as fresh as it should have been?",

This was my first time dining at Pamela's.  I really enjoyed the corn beef hash but my French toast was rubbish.  I ordered the American style French toast topped with strawberries.  The strawberries were great but they couldn't mask the nastiness of the French toast.  The Fresh toast was not sweet at all. It desperately needed some powered sugar and no matter how much syrup I added it could not be helped.    My hubby got the blueberry hotcakes.  We were both expecting pancakes but instead he was served a thin crepe like pancake.  He said that the hotcakes were very tasty and  I could see they were full of fresh blueberries and topped with whipped cream.    The corn beef hash is worth traveling for, but the thin pancakes and nasty French toast not so much.",

    "text": "If you live in the Pittsburgh area and haven't been to Pamela's for breakfast, brunch or lunch, shame on you!  Pamela's is a must!!  Quick service, reasonable prices and a heaping plateful of deliciousness.  So many options but I typically opt for the classic 2 eggs, toast and the Lyonnaise potatoes.  They also have turkey sausage.  The potatoes are terrific and not to be missed.   Plus they leave a carafe of coffee on your table so no need to wait for hot refills!  The worst parts about Pamela's are the long wait on weekends (I recommend going early) and that its cash only.  Why do I forget that every single time?   No worries, there is a PNC ATM right around the corner.  Ps...I love the gentleman who buses tables.   He seems to love his job and busts a few dance moves and is tapping his feet as he clears tables.   He just brings a smile to my face.",

Yes, parking is a nightmare. Yes, they only take cash. But one bite of their house-made chorizo and Lyonnaise potatoes erases any other shortcomings that may exist. I have tried just about every item on their breakfast menu and can say without reservation that it is all incredible.  This is the one place in Pittsburgh that we never, ever, ever miss going to each time we are in town. The food is always hot, fresh, and absolutely delicious. From the crispy-edged pancakes to the funky Trash Hash, there isn't one False start in the bunch. They also make a great cup of bottomless coffee!  Bottom line: if you only have time for one restaurant in Pittsburgh, don't waste it on Primanti Bros. Go to Pamela's!",

Standing room only, as always, but the wait always goes by quick - probably about a ten minute wait at 8:30am. It's been busy every time I've been there but the service is so efficient, it's kind of crazy.   We were seated in the back room, which I like better because then you don't have to watch all the other hungry people wait to be seated. The decor is exactly what you'd expect from an older diner and there are black & white photos plastered on the wall.  This time I ordered the veggie omelet. It came with their lyonnaise potatoes and toast. So so good, I love their potatoes and their toast is thick and delicious. I've had other omelets and their stuffed banana chocolate chip hot cakes and I've never been disappointed nor left hungry. Very big portions and very reasonable prices. Pamela's is everything I could want in a breakfast.  Long story short: Come here and come hungry. Don't expect to eat anything else the rest of the day. And bring your wallet, it's cash only.",

    "text": "Wandered in there today looking for breakfast.  Small but varied menu and generous portions.  Had the Pittsburgh hash ( potatoes, kielbasa, sauerkraut and cheese) with 2 eggs and toast.  Quite good.  But I'm only giving 3 stars because it's cash only and because it's apparently optional for the cooks to wear gloves.  Saw one  gentleman plating food (sausage, bacon, toast) with his bare hands! Major turn off for me, no matter how good the food was.",

    "text": "All I can say is YUM.  As many other reviewers have said, get the hotcakes. Or pancakes. Or whatever they're called. They're a cross between a crepe and a pancake with a little dash of heaven thrown in. You can get them in different flavors, I believe, but they're just as good plain. If it's your first time in, that's probably what you should get, if you're having trouble deciding. Round out the meal with some bacon, eggs and coffee and you're good to go.  The second time I went in, I tried the corned beef hash and eggs. Man are they good! They give you a generous portion and you'd better bring an empty stomach because you'll need room to put it all away. Folks, this is diner food at its finest. Why go to Denny's when you can eat locally?  The decor inside is kitschy and old school. Lots of black and white photos, memorabilia and tchotchkes of a bygone era line the walls and give you something to look at and talk about while your stomach growls in anticipation.  Just be warned, weekends are crazy, busy and crowded, and parking is at a premium. Also, they don't take plastic, so bring the green. Stake your place in line while another person from your group goes and gets a \"snack\" from Peace, Love and Donuts.  It's worth the wait.",

I recommend the hotcakes for a sweet breakfast and the Pittsburgh Hash if you want something savory. Both were delicious. *Cash only*",

    "text": "Pamela's saved us after we were turned away from the S&D Polish Deli down the street for not being Polish enough (we may have fled after being stared at uncomfortably by three strange women).  Wandering gypsies without a home, we found Pamela's a few blocks up and they welcomed us. This Cash Only (of course) diner in the amazing Strip District is freaking adorable with portraits, news articles and art all over the walls. It screams kitsch, and being of the tacky variety of human I immediately felt comfortable here.   I was really craving something fattening, like a milkshake, but Pamela's saved me from myself by being one of those rare diners that doesn't offer milkshakes. Fine. I ordered the hamburger, and indeed it tasted like a hamburger. The fries were definitely made out of potatoes. Our silverware was clean. The place didn't smell like vomit, and that speaks volumes when it comes to diners. The guy running the place gave us advice about Pittsburgh, useful bits such as \"Yeah, this town is dead by 6 pm.\" Good to know.  Pamela's was by the far the most welcoming place we encountered in this area (S&D and Penn Avenue Fish both being just outright rude), and for that they earn a place in this Southern girl's heart.",

We were seated right away and had coffee and juice very quickly.  I was advised by a friend to get the pancakes.  I got the banana nut version, although the strawberry pancakes looked really good too!  Our food came our very quickly and was delicious!  The pancakes are hot, thin and buttery, almost like a crepe.  They were rolled around bananas and chopped nuts and didn't need much syrup because they were sweet.  I was very happy with my breakfast!",

The burger was standard diner fare, but the onion rings that came with it were delicious and perfectly friend. The jalapeno crisps and burger toppings were perfect and made for a really delicious lunch... I will def be back for breakfast and lunch in the future  do wish they would take debit card, but cash talks in this case",
