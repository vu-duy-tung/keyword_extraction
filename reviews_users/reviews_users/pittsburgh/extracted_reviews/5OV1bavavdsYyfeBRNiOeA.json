    "text": "I've been to Osteria twice now. Once to grab a sandwich for lunch, and then to get a takeout pizza for dinner. I've really hoped this place would be good as I live across the street. My experience has been mixed. Sandwich was a very good Italian deli sandwich. Pizza was mediocre though. While the pizza had the unintended positive effect of reminding me of free pizza consumed when I was in grad school in NYC that's not the best sign of quality. Not bad but could be better.   There's a lot of potential for Osteria and I hope they succeed. Maybe a weekend brunch would be a good addition? And make pizza less like basic takeout pizza and more \"fancy\" (tasty too).",

They serve delicious, well-made Italian food, the atmosphere is casual and unassuming, the prices are incredibly reasonable, staff is nice and the service is good.  The restaurant has never been crowded for us when we dine early in the evening, so with all that, it's very family friendly.  My young daughters even enjoy dining here, and they are pretty picky eaters.  We've always enjoyed the riccolina, gnocchi and pizza.",

    "text": "We were told to check out the Strip district and after driving around quite a few times and not being able to decide on a spot or find parking, we noticed the sign for Osteria near the market. And Thank Goodness we did!! We may have been hungry, but the food far exceeded our expectations! The soup - a white bean and prosciutto - was perfectly flavored; salty and peppery and delicious all over. I do wish it would have come out a tad warmer - that may have been an issue of the large shallow bowl it was served in. A very unique presentation of the prosciutto in the soup - very well executed. My friend enjoyed her spaghetti and meatballs, which I sampled and found very tasty myself.  I immensely enjoyed the cavatelli! There are few words that can describe how scrumptious this dish was! Velvety, rich pasta perfectly cooked with brussel sprouts and salty pork. Amazing!! The bread was nice and fresh. The service was nice and attentive. I would return if I am ever back in Pittsburgh.",

The caesar was delicious and the lobster salad had a ton of lobster on it for $7, but tasted like straight white vinegar.  Overpowered the lobster and the greens it was over.  We also all shared the meatball side and it was okay, but was only ground beef and i like my meatballs mixed with other meats.  Our pizza took about 30 minutes to come out, we ordered a white pizza, which was delicious, but the chef came out and explained that the first one came out terrible so he was making us a new one, he took it off our bill, so that was nice.  The crust was amazing, I don't typically eat pizza crust, but I forewent the bread and dipped the crust in the delicious garlic oil that came out prior to the pizza with the bread basket.  All in all its a great atmosphere, great prices, and I will definitely go back to try the pastas and other dishes.  Our server was great too!",

    "text": "A group of coworkers decided to venture over to Osteria on Monday for a quick easy lunch. Quick, nor easy was on the menu for today's special. Several of us ordered meatball subs, one a salad and soup and the other a prosciutto sandwich. The bread for the sandwiches were hard as rock. The meatballs were just ok. The meat to cheese veggies ratio on the prosciutto was way out of proportion. No balance at all. One diner had to send her soup back as it was off the charts too salty. She also requested no dressing on her salad, yet the salad came out drenched in dressing. Even too much for someone who enjoys dressing directly on the salad. On top of the sub par food, the service was even worse. The waitresses that work there seem entitled and elite. Not attentive to the customers needs at all. Had to ask for refills on soda and water also had to go to counter to discuss the salty soup. I am not one to swear off restaurants, cause I understand everyone has a bad day every once in awhile. But this is a common theme at Osteria. As a side note, the quality of food for the price is not equivalent. There are too many other better options in the Strip to waste time and money at Osteria.",

    "text": "Ehhh....I'm gonna give them a 3, a high 3, since I felt the entrees Kay and I ordered were too flawed to warrant a stronger rating. We came here prior to the Dio Disciples show at Altar Bar the other night (Hey, Ronnie Dio was Italian after all), and being that it had truffle oil in it, I just had to sample the Riccolina, truffle oil being something I'd been dying to try for many years.   Fede pasta is a peculiar, long, fat macaroni that is solid instead of hollow inside. In this instance, it was al dente but had no flavor, the truffle oil failing to permeate the pasta. The arugala, however, absorbed it beautifully.   What does truffle oil taste like? I'd describe it as a really robust olive oil. It's wild like an aphrodisiac or something taken from the pheremonal gland of a fantastical creature. I.E. I enjoyed it but realize that it either attracts or repels. Back to the dish itself...  The broth that collected at the bottom, something which also carried the truffle oil flavor fairly well, made me wonder if this was supposed to be a pasta dish or a soup. The caramelized mushroom chunks merely loitered.   Not that the Riccolina was terrible, it's just that the truffle oil and arugala were the only things going for it. In fact, it was so lacking in flavor, I did something I rarely do at a restaurant since I feel it should be done before service; I used a salt shaker.   My salad and dessert, on the other hand, both saved the evening, sort of.   Wouldn't you know I ordered the Tomato and Mozzarella salad also? And wouldn't you know that it was a winner? The fresh mozzarella discs should be given out for Holy Communion as they were seraphic, delicate, \"lighter than air\" like the wizard in the Dio-era Rainbow song \"Stargazer\"...   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DAIdxjegXKSw&s=dccda0768f54181d8648915f7b17158071974ce81db68b82848f4a2ba64a4fc5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=AIdx...</a>  The cubed tomatoes were fresh from a garden tended by a careful farmer as they were ideally ripe, juicy, berry-sweet, and dressed with a supradelectable house vinaigrette.  Each of our desserts were quality homemade creations. Kay had an individual coconut cream pie that was a flaky basket of custardy, whipped-up delight. My post-meal treat was a rich Cookies And Cream cake that held an Oreo cream filling and was topped with a fab, fudgy ganache, making it the most luxurious lunchbox pastry ever created.  Kay wasn't crazy about her Rigatoni, and after tasting the dishwater sauce, it was easy to see (taste?) why. Although, the sausage that wallowed in that sauce had a tenderness and savoriness that was beyond belief.   The complimentary bread was also noteworthy as it came with a spice-infused olive oil for the bread to soak up famously.  Alyssa, our server, was attentive and polite. The decor was akin to a modern, swanky deli, and overall, the atmosphere was quiet, especially for the teeming Strip District.   P.S. I came very close to ordering a sandwich.  P.P.S. My dinner, aside from sampling the meat in Kay's dish, was unwittingly vegetarian. Good on me.  P.P.P.S. I finally got to review #666! This is cause for celebration!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DeML6X8VfAfY&s=3cd3d6c37f642489b861c0e440436709326f81fe3c151a0862d002e25862cea4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=eML6...</a>",

Basically,  it is bland and an insulting misrepresentation of Italian food.  I struggled to rate this. I considered giving them a 3. Merely based on the fact, the pasta they do not prepare in-house, the Fede pasta is local. Fede pasta is a pasta company located right outside the city of PGH. However, giving them a rating ONLY based on something they happen to carry and do not actually \"make\" seemed too gracious.  Can I also say what a major pain it is to have to get up from my table to walk to the other side of the restaurant in order to read the wine list.  Someone cannot type one up or use an etch-a-sketch? ((Yawns. This place very much underwhelmed me))  Overall, the establishment did not put much effort into a pleasant dining experience therefore, I will not put much effort into writing a review.

    "text": "It was Darren's turn to pick a place to eat so we came to Osteria, both of use with huge appetites. I looked over the rather limited menu and didn't really see much that appealed to me, but if something contains peppers, mushrooms, or raw tomato I will NOT eat it. So I finally narrowed it down.   The friendly server brought us a colored glass bottle containing water before taking our order. She then presented us with a metal basket containing 2 different varieties of Italian bread and a yummy oil and herb dipping sauce. If you don't know much about Italian (or French) bread, it has a rather hard crust and deliciously soft center. I think the bread, while flavorful, would have been better served warm, but that is personal preference. Oh, and the iced tea is fresh brewed and unsweetened, not that powder/syrup crap.   My chicken soup was the best item that I ordered on this occasion. The meat was just ok, but the vegetables were fresh tasting and cooked to perfection. Not mushy at all, and with just a very slight crunch. The chicken broth also had a nice flavor.   I settled on the rigatoni, and was rather disappointed. The sauce was very thin and the pork was, I don't know what, but it didn't taste very good. The noodles were not bad tasting, and the sausage absorbed the flavor from the pork, which again I didn't like. Salt and pepper didn't even fix the blandness. The best part of the dish was the huge scoop of ricotta cheese on top. It helped mask the lack of flavor.   My dessert consisted of an individual coconut cream pie. The pre-made crust nice and flaky, the coconut cream sweet, and topped with whipped cream. I couldn't finish the pie as the sweetness was just a bit too much for me, but again, preference.   Over all impression, I felt like I was visiting a friend's family for dinner and while the cooking wasn't appealing, I ate what I could to be polite. The family, however, is sweet as the pie they served.",

The place has a nice interior, but was completely empty.  The service was good, prompt and friendly.  Although it would be hard to imagine it could be bad since we were one out of 3 other patrons there.  I started my meal off with the  Arugula salad - arugula, roasted peppers, balsamic vinaigrette, Gorgonzola.  It was good, and tasted fresh.  It wasn't huge though, although I expected that since the price tag was $3.  DH got Cavatelli  with house made pasta, roasted carrot, eggplant, squash puree.  The pasta was totally overcooked and lacked any good flavor, although it looked tasty.  I ordered the Riccolina - fede pasta, caramelized mushrooms, truffle oil, arugula, Parmigiano Reggiano.  The fede pasta was just weird.  It was thick and heavy, and didn't take up any of the flavorful broth.  The only thing I liked about this dish was the arugula, Parmigiano Reggiano and the truffle oil/broth.  The mushrooms were odd and definitely didn't taste like they were caramelized.    I don't think I'll be back here again, very disappointing.",

So I am trying to find different places to go, unfortunately I will not be going back to Osteria.  I should have known better when upon our arrival we were the first people other than the employees at 6pm.  A total of three tables had reservation signs, another two top and one four top.  All during dinner, no one, no one came in to eat dinner.  We ordered the mussels to start.  They were small and had a very fishy taste to them.  A couple of them were closed, meaning they are dead.  Overall they were some of the smallest mussels I ever ate.  My wife orders lobster ravioli and I ordered the house pappardelle.  The house made pasta was too thick, undercooked, and never married with the sauce like a good pasta dish should be.  Service was okay, though I did observe our server eating behind the counter.  The last dish my wife and I shared was shrimp and scallops which came in a small casserole dish.  The scallops and shrimp  dish was okay, beside being made with cheap small seafood.

Outside of the riccolina, I would have to give a thumbs up to the warm tomato appetizer, the spaghetti and the rigatoni. They are all super delicious. Only one of the pasta dishes have we tried that I would recommend you pass on, though I can't recall it now (I think it was a special).  I also tend to like the bread they serve prior to your meal. Yummy.  The menu is not extensive (as every menu should not be), but the items they have are quite tasty as far as the pastas go. I've only ever sat at the bar and the bartenders at first came off as kind of cold, but then we realized they just weren't chatty. Which is weird when you're a bartender, but oh well.

The first time I was there, I was the only customer in the place after the lunch rush, and the server/cashier was annoyed and not helpful whatsoever about the menu. I had never been there before, so I asked a few simple questions and it was like I was bothering her. The second time I was there- same experience except this was a different server (male). When you walk in the place there is no direction as to whether you seat yourself, etc- being that there is a large order counter, one would assume you order there and sit down like a Panera, so that is very unclear. I intended to sit there and eat my meal there, however per the confusion my food was made to go, and i just took it and left rather than make a stink about it. Lastly, I would say the food is very lackluster and overpriced. I had the Chicken Salad Sandwich the first time, which was just OK. I order the gnocchi on my second visit and it basically had no flavor. It could be a good spot, the ambience is kind of cool, but between the service and mediocre food, I'll take a pass.",

    "text": "I so wanted this to be good.  My parents were in Pittsburgh and I suggested this as a spot to meet for lunch since it's close to my office.  A first time visit for all three of us.  I was going to order soup and a salad but the waitress informed us that they were out of the buffalo mozzarella, tomato salad.  Considering that's one of my top ten favorite dishes and sometimes I even make it for myself for dinner, I was a little disappointed I couldn't order it.  The three of us opted to order the soup de jour, broccoli cheddar and split a plain pizza.    The soup was fairly thick and cheesy and had big chunks of broccoli.  As veggie and cheese lovers, my Mom and I thought it was very good.  The pizza, on the other hand, was terrible.  It was a thin crust but it had been over cooked so the bottom was black.  It honestly never should have made it out of the kitchen because it put a terrible taste in our mouth (literally and figuratively).  Also, it felt like the wait for the pizza was very long and ended up not being worth it.  Having said that, the waitress did the right thing and ended up not charging us for the pizza.  While that seems like the obvious thing to do, I've been to plenty of places that have served an awful meal and not offered to do the right thing, so kudos to Osteria and I'll give you a second chance because of that.  I thought the atmosphere in here was great.  High ceilings, open space (very loft like) with an eclectic mix of tables and chairs and a counter if you want to opt for a quicker lunch.  I also thought the prices were very reasonable.",

The service was friendly, and the red wines were mostly blends, but were tasty and affordable. The gnocchi was pretty good, as was the ricciolina. A little on the al dente side, but tasty nonetheless. One thing I was pleased by--the portion size was actually reasonable! Not gigantic. A cute place we'll try again.",

The atmosphere is kind of industrial cafeteria, so not the place you want to go for a romantic dinner.  If you want higher end Italian in a more intimate atmosphere with a better wine list there are other options in town (Dish, Jos Tambellini, Stagioni).  There are also a ton of run of the mill mom and pop pasta joints that have a loyal, older following and serve ridiculously large portions - Osteria is certainly a cut above these.  You just have to go in with the right expectations.",

Didn't know about the connection with Cioppino.  Might check that place out next time we are in town visiting.  We will not be going back to Osteria though.",

We were delighted with the offered selections and surprised by the even kitchen execution. Beet, squash & goat cheese over arugula and butternut squash bisque were excellent openers. My pork tenderloin main was fork tender and tasty and my partner loved her Cod Franchaise! Nutella nut tart and vanilla creme brulee were delicious finales. The $15 wine trio was high level with nice pours and our server, Melissa, was delightful and attentive to our needs. We were impressed enough to go back to see if they have a consistent product.",

    "text": "Great desserts but the wait staff leaves a lot to be desired. We want to like this place (live across the street in the Cork Factory), but after 3 tries, it may be time to just give up.  The last straw was simply trying to sit outside with my wife and have desserts. First, we stopped inside the door and told the waiter that came to seat us that we would just have dessert outside. We sat and waited without anyone coming outside to acknowledge us (not sure how long?). So I went back in the door and let the next person that came to seat me that we were sitting outside and just interested in dessert. A waiter came out 5 minutes later with water and dinner menus, so we again said we wanted dessert - to which he said he normally works next door at Cioppiono and would send someone else out with a dessert menu. After we had been sitting for 20 minutes, I went back inside and let the next person know it had been 20 minutes and all we needed was desert. So we got a second guy to come out with dessert menu, then they all disappeared again. After another 10-15 minutes without any sign of service, we just left.  Really, this is not that difficult! Why can't a simple service orientation be built here to create what can be huge customer loyalty with a huge active customer base living 1 minute away? It is an opportunity missed (more than once).",

    "text": "Should've had the big-a** peanut butter cup in the dessert case. Coulda, shoulda, woulda...but didn't. Instead, I opted for the Warm Lobster Salad and Turkey Club. My bud Jesse ordered the Caesar Salad and Cavatelli.  Both salads were sad little guys.  The Lobster Salad has a LOT of potential though. The lobster itself was delicious, but the accompanying endive needed a lil' something else. His Caesar Salad was a little embarrassing to bear such a name.  It was romaine, period.  The good news is, the bread basket was fresh and complemented by a delightful olive oil, parmesan and herb-infused dipping combo.    Onto the main courses: My turkey sandwich was decent, but uneventful.  At $7 it wasn't grossly overpriced, but a little too much.  Jesse's Cavatelli was definitely the highlight of all things Osteria.  It was unique and delectable; nestled in a nice broth and shaved cheeses.  Yum.  All things considered, I'm not sure it's worth a trip back (save for that peanut butter cup).  The atmosphere is a really nice \"casual classy, \" but there are just too many other awesome options in the 'Burgh!",

Caesar salad was blah, didn't taste like Caesar dressing.  No bread was served or even offered.  I ordered the chicken parm.  Chicken was good, but deep fried and nothing to write home about.  Hardly any sauce.  The spaghetti was extremely underdressed, stuck together with a heavy taste of flour.  What little sauce was there had absolutely no seasoning.  I had to ask for Parmesan for the chicken Parmesan!  My husband ordered the gnocchi, which qS so loaded with cheese it was almost inedible.  You had to peel the melted cheese away to find the gnocchi, which were very mushy.  Hardly any sauce just enough cheese to fill a dinner plate.  We left hungry and feeling slightly sick.

All previous meals were good food but things must change for dinner time.   The music was way too loud and we could barely have a conversation. Service was just off the mark... Not to mention the server looked like they forgot to shower and rolled right out of bed.  They were out of multiple items!!! Their soup was unavailable as well as the clams. It's had to make the suggestion for a substitute which they did. But why does the customer have to come up with this idea.   It was sat night and there were very few people in the place. So not sure why it took an hour for salads. And then a long wait for food.   Bad service with under seasoned food. Server never asked for drink refills.   This place just missed the mark. With so many new places and great food... Service has to be top notch or you won't last long in the burgh.",

No big deal there, but I have a concern about the menu, which has cheese weaved into nearly every dish.  This is not a practice you find in Italy.  It's an American, and especially a Pittsburgh thing.  Enough with the cheese avalanche.  Still, I was able to find one salad and one entree without.  Both were really, really good.  The sign of an artistic chef.  I just wished I'd had some choice.  I read some reviews here complaining about the portions.  These are normal sized portions, and very typical of real Italian food.

I like the prices here, the food is rather inexpensive, so you get a lot for your money.  We had a large party and waited a long time for our food, but Osteria was aware of that and they brought out a tray of free desserts.  They also did not charge one person for their beer.  So they are trying real hard to improve. Let's hope they can do better!  I ordered the seafood pasta.  It was okay, just not the heavy creaminess and rich flavor I was hoping for.",

I came here for a dinner meeting and was surprised by how empty it was, but this made it perfect for having a meeting over dinner at.  The service was great, very attentive.  I started with the lobster bisque, which was the soup of the day. It was not the typical lobster bisque, it had a much darker color and very deep flavor.  For dinner I had the carbonara and it was delicious and cooked perfectly.  I also tried a bite of the gnocchi and it was yummy as well. And oh so cheesy.",

The broth is delectable! Bread selection and olive oil for the table was so far above average it is hard to describe...nothing mundane about it. We also split the sausage stuffed pepper app and the flavors were just wonderful..with a nice kick too!  The table had the scallop entree special..fabulous! Carbonara...out of this world! Spinach and sausage over HOMEMADE wide pasta noodles...truly amazing..again with the magnificent broth! Our 4th had clams and mussels with linguine and he raved as well. The desserts are all home made as well. Great service and either the chef and/or owner visited our table. Great experience!",

They have regular tables, high tables with seats with no backs and a small bar. Mushroom flatbread pizza was delicious but could use a little green. I ordered the Brussel sprout and kale salad from the restaurant week menu and couldn't say enough good things about it. It came with walnuts, raisins and a tasty dressing. The salmon salad was oily and the fish was a little strong. The chicken piccata was not good. Two out of the three pieces of chicken were extremely chewy. However the staff was nice and took it back and offered me a new dish. The gnocchi did not taste like it was made from ricotta, too thick and the sauce was a little cold. However the sausage pappardelle and seafood fra diavolo were both tasty. Desserts were mediocre - Poached pair and flourless chocolate cake.",

    "text": "Osteria is one of those hit or miss places.  We've had awkward interactions with the staff there on more than one occasion.  Once, the server didn't seem to know the menu very well and then another time a different server made it appear that we should've made a reservation, but then told us to sit anywhere we want as long as there wasn't a \"reserved\" sign on the table.  Just a bit weird.  We wound up sitting at the bar.  The food is okay for the most part.  Sometimes the pasta can taste overcooked.  We know it's made in house, so I'm guessing they just have \"off nights\"?  My husband loves their mussels dish.  His favorite part is sopping up all the sauce with the bread.  However, I'd steer clear of the pizza.  It's like eating pizza sauce and cheese on a saltine cracker.  It burns very easy and it's just not good.  Their pastry chef makes all the desserts in house. I will say that their tiramisu is delicious.  One last thing is that there isn't really a comfy seat in the place.  You're choices are either wooden benches, wooden bar stools, or aluminum chairs that look and feel sort of flimsy.  We are Strip residents, so we usually head over to this place once every couple of months.  It's not horrible, it's an okay place to get a meal in the Strip and the prices are pretty reasonable.  But, as I said before, it's hit and miss.",

Due to the non-peak time, we were the only ones in the restaurant and chose to sit at the bar.   The bartender was very nice, though not up to speed on the beer info. The samples, however, were very healthy.   We ordered the meatball and a pizza (1/2 pepperoni, 1/2 mushroom. The meatball had a kick to it, and we appreciated the real Parmesan! The pizza was overloaded with cheese, so I ordered a side of sauce to go with. The sauce was super bright, but it was needed to balance out the amount of cheese on the pie.   After our meal, I asked for a taste of their homemade chocolate brownie ice cream. Thanks to the bartender for the healthy sample of that, too :)  I don't think we'll be back to this place, as other locations for dining in Pittsburgh have wowed us a bit more.",

    "text": "This is my second time visiting Osteria 2350. Both times that I've visited, I've gone with a larger group. We've chosen Osteria because it's never crowded and you're always able to get a table, which is both good and bad.   If I could give this place 3.5 stars I would. I want want to really, really love it but there is something that's missing. However, we've always had a really pleasant experience there so I decided to round up to 4.  First and foremost, the service has been great both times we visited. Both servers were attentive and friendly. Though they do serve alcohol, we choose to bring our own wine. You are allowed to do so with a $8 corkage fee per bottle.  The basil olive oil and bread were fantastic! We also ordered some olives to snack on while we waited for our main dishes. I can't remember all of the entrees at the table, but I do remember we had carbonara, gnocchi, chicken Piccata, and chicken Parmesan. This is not the best Italian food you are going to get in Pittsburgh. They were all good, but were missing something that made them great. There was a TON of cheese on my gnocchi. With traditional Italian, you won't find that... but American-Italian always seems to overload with cheese so I'm used to that!  The portions were right on. I think a lot of people are used to being served Olive Garden-sized portions of Italian food, and that sets them up for disappointment if/when they eat traditional Italian-sized portions. We had enough room for dessert, which was all absolutely wonderful! We had a choco-taco (hello blast from the past!), an ice cream sandwich, and two types of cake. One was \"7 Layers of Sin\" and that was the favorite among the table.   Would I go back? Yes, I think so if it's convenient! I'm not going to make a point to rush back soon, but if I were in the area and craving Italian, this would do the trick.",

Tiny bits of prosciutto or giant pieces that look like they were cut at the deli counter.  Ingredients always fresh and staff awesome. But seriously get some consistency in the entrees.",

What really stood out was one of the employees preparing the food behind the counter had a BIG SWASTIKA tattoo on his arm.

The menu is not large but offers appetizers, salads, sandwiches and entree.  I enjoyed greatly the asparagus, arugula salad.

Abundant beans cooked to a nice al dente texture, generous greens in a delicious garlic sauce.  This place is a winner.",

I detailed everything we ordered so that you don't make the same mistakes that we did.  7 Items  1 Mac n' Cheese  $14.00 1 Shrimp Scampi  $17.00 1 Apple and Bleu Flatbread  $10.00 2 Meatball  $2.50 1 Bruschetta  $7.00 1 Baklava Cheesecake  $5.00 1 Mocha Pie  $6.00  Mac n' Cheese - This was surprisingly the best thing that we ordered disregarding the desserts.  It was greasy and not much cheese but we could stomach it.  Definitely NOT worth $14 for the portion or the quality.  3/5 stars  Shrimp Scampi - This was without a doubt the worst item we ordered.  The pasta appeared to be reheated and gooey.  It was stuck together in one large clump that we could not separate.  We had to use a knife and fork to \"slice\" it apart.  It was bland and disgusting.  I think there were (6) 16 count tail on shrimp with no seasoning.  They were cooked (Thank the baby Jesus that they got that right) but there was hardly any butter/garlic sauce to be found.  Also NOT worth $17.  1/5 stars  Apple and Bleu Flatbread - My fiancee wanted to try this and said it was OK.  The apples were raw and didn't go well with the rest but unlike the rest of our order it was fairly edible.  3/5 stars  Meatballs - We got two of these to split.  They were dried out balls of meat that seemed to be reheated.  I ate an entire one and regretted it immediately afterwards.  The fiancee threw hers out because it was also nasty.  1/5 stars  Bruschetta - This was tasty but the driver must have rolled his car down a hill on the way here.  The bruschetta was tossed in with the bread so everything was jumbled and mixed together.  I'm sure this would be better in person without Evil Knieval delivering it.  3/5 stars  Baklava Cheesecake - Fiancee said this was tasty.  Not the best she had but also nothing like the other menu items.  We are guessing the desserts are made somewhere else or come frozen. 4/5 stars  Mocha Pie - I had a few bites of this and it was OK.  3/5 stars  My total bill was $80 for this horrible food.  It is NOT worth the money and our meals ran straight through both of us.  The good news about this place is that it will clean you out if constipated.  I cannot recommend based on this experience.",

(Sorry if the picture quality is bad, it was a bit dark!)  * Food: I haven't tried too many Italian places in Pittsburgh because I never crave it but my boyfriend and I decided to try this place. We got the Pork Confit Ragu and Seafood Fra Diavolo. The Pork Confit was my favorite- the truffle wine sauce really did it for me. The pork almost melted in my mouth. The Seafood Fra Diavolo was a tiny but spicy which I enjoyed but there wasn't anything too special.    * Cost vs. Worth: Their entrees are around $14-$18 which is a decent price for the portions. I had nothing to complain about!  Will I come here again? - Probably not but only because I want to try other Italian restaurants!",

Because not only was it delicious from the first bite, but it was still delicious 3 days later for leftovers (when properly heated in the toaster oven of course)!   I tried the prosciutto, margarita and cheese pizzas. The margarita was my fave. It was simple and delicious. The cheese made it, it was just crisp and delicious with a little bite. The prosciutto is from Parma Sausage. It's salty, so fair warning if you like or don't like salt. What I found unexpected, but enjoyed, was that the artichoke and mushrooms I choose to put on it were marinated in vinegar. It was really different but I loved it. I love pickled veggies, so this was a winner for me! You can choose from their own menu or make your own pizza.   I am also very happy to report they already carry GF buns and pasta. Plus, they have a full bar and are open for lunch and dinner. It's a cute and casual ambiance, perfect for any occasion. Guys, this might be my new home!",

For the 3 course dinner, I had the gazpacho, the eggplant lasagna, and the chocolate cheesecake. The gazpacho has so much flavor and texture. The eggplant lasagna may be the best version of that dish I have ever had. The eggplant was perfectly crispy, there was cheese with every bite, it wasn't runny at all with sauce. Just delicious! And the chocolate cheesecake is probably up there with the top 5 deserts i have ever had. Overall the meal was super filling and overall flavorful and perfectly portioned. So happy to have tried this place out! Highly recommend!",

Today, I decided to order the Eggplant Parm sandwich. Because I don't do white bread I asked if I could it on wheat bread. We only have one type of bread here--white. So diverse. One of the specials was a fish sandwich with French fries so I asked if I could get fries instead of chips. After checking with someone behind the counter, the server said, \"No, we do not substitute.\" I should have left at that point, but my lunch time was ticking down. I ordered it anyway.   Surprisingly, the food was delivered pretty quickly. The sandwich was good, but the chips were only okay. I didn't finish them.   So a breakdown: food and service (4 stars), other nonsense with only having white bread and no substitutions (2 stars) = 3 stars.",

The service was friendly and the place itself has a nice ambiance. However, that's pretty much where it halted for me. The greens and beans we ordered came with arugula and asparagus and were very skimped on the beans. It also did not taste like regular greens and beans, which if you are familiar, you know has a ton of escarole, beans, and parmesan. I also tried \"Odin's Muse\" for a cocktail and was not a fan at all. A very very odd aftertaste. I got the chicken parm and was completely underwhelmed with the lack of flavor. It tasted like someone tossed the pasta with old laundry water. :(    I would not choose to come back here unless they made some improvements on flavor.",

The prosciutto flatbread was good as well, but the wild mushroom one had too much garlic (it seemed to have a full clove per slice). The other pastas drew positive notes from my group, but it's hard to mess up a tomato sauce base. Avoid the carbonara; it's bland and lacks enough of a peppercorn kick, was too runny and unnecessarily supplemented with peas.",

My experience was so amazing I put in a Valentine's Day night reservation right away. At restaurant week they served a special menu: items that aren't on their main menu. Every. Single. Dish. Made me want to eat there every night. And the restaurant week prices made it so much more worth it! For Valentine's Day, we ordered the anti pasta dish, the sausage and spinach pasta dish, and the pork confit dish! We cleaned our plates! And we cleaned two bread and pesto plates too. Maybe this says the main dishes didn't provide enough food.. but for the price, it was almost reasonable for fine dining in Pittsburgh. We enjoyed our night in the modern/rustic vibe tavern. The host and the server were very attentive! Definitely recommend for a date night or a ladies night!",

When we arrived our long table was all set the wine and charcuterie boards so nicely prepared! The waiter taking care of us was phenomenal! All of our meals were exceptional! They all came out together, were hot and yummy! Kudos to the chef and food staff! For dessert I had contacted their pastry chef, Meghann., and she was wonderful offering suggestions! We decided on cupcakes and she made them with dental and math decorations. And they were so good! The frosting was creamy and the cake was moist! Even being full from a great dinner everyone ate one! I can't praise Osteria enough! They provided my friends and family a relaxing atmosphere to enjoy ourselves!  We stayed for 4 hours!! We would come back to Pittsburgh just to experience this wonderful restaurant again!Thank you Osteria for a great evening!",

    "text": "Yum!   We went to Osteria 2350 on a Monday for restaurant week.   Restaurant week is a mixed bag for me.  You'd think it would be a chance for restaurants to show their stuff, but I find that most just \"phone it in\" with watered down menus that they can turn over quickly - especially the ones with the $20.17 menus.  Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised when Osteria 2350 really shined.  The meal was delicious from start to finish and I enjoyed every bite.   We started with a glass of $5 happy hour wine and then did the restaurant week menu.   Here's what I had.     Stuffed Mission Figs with gorgonzola, prosciutto, and aged balsamic.  So this dish was a tiny little starter.  I was initially a little worried that I'd end up hungry based on its size, but it was delicious and well paired with the wine.  A nice start to the meal.         Wood-Roasted Hanger Steak with cauliflower mash and smoked apple and onion demi glace.  This steak was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth - which is no small feat for a hanger steak.  The steak had a ton of flavor and really hit the spot.   The sauce and the cauliflower mash were perfect compliments and the red wine added a little something too.   The dish was not large, but not small either - just right.    Cannoli Panna Cotta - house made cannoli shell, Grand Marnier-sweetened mascarpone and ricotta cheese, chocolate shards, and pistachio paste   This dessert was pretty and so yummy.  It was just the right amount of sweet with varied textures and a smooth finish.   It was served with a sherry that tasted like cough syrup to me; but I don't really like sherry, so that might have just been me.      Overall, the meal was very well done for the $20.17 and the $15 wine pairings were worth it.   Even though I didn't like the sherry, the two reds were very good and the pours were reasonably sized.  Service was swift, but not rushed.  Parking is validated.   What's not to like?",

I came here with a big party so I expected to wait long for food and drinks to come out, but the server had our cards for well over 30 mins which was longer than I was expecting.",
