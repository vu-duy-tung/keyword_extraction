It was moist, and served with a tasty Caesar sauce, not dry like most chicken sandwiches I've had elsewhere.  My husband had a great mushroom ravioli.  Sean has brought the type of restaurant to the area that the  North Hills sorely needs.",

Dave and Duffy's followed and lasted for ten years and was always successful until the owner died and they were forced to sell the place.  Since then, the restaurants in this building have progressively gotten more and more stupid.  This one sets a new benchmark for stupidity.  Who in their right mind would think that a place like this would \"make it\" in this area?  They have literally no bar food (pig wings?  honestly what the heck is that?), the beer selection is unreasonably expensive, and the food is really only suitable for a pre-Oscar party, not a neighborhood restaurant.  I give it until April until this place goes under, and joins the likes Magoo's Natoli's, Fiddlers, and Ziggy's.  BRING BACK BALDINI'S!!!!!!!",

    "text": "Consistently excellent. Bistro 9101 is my go-to restaurant for a locally-owned fantastic experience.  Steakhouse Saturday is a real gem. Choose your steak, your seasoning, your salad/soup, your side dish. Very reasonably priced, and quite possibly the best steak I've ever had. The horseradish crusted steak I chose in the winter has been replaced by the Gorgonzola crusted steak, but they still offer blackened and black pepper preparations.  The menu changes seasonally, so don't expect to see exactly what is on the posted menu photos. Generally, there are soups, salads, sandwiches, entrees, pastas and desserts. Their wine and beer menu is well-rounded, and their signature cocktails are tasty (although a bit heavy on the ice).  Children are welcome, and my five year old had lunch with me here on a few occasions after a trip to the library right up the hill. For $6, he had grilled chicken, spaghetti with marinara, and orange slices from their children's menu. So much healthier and fresher than some fast food meal for the same price! Tables are covered in table cloths with white paper on top, so kids can color and draw while they wait for their meal.  Most recently I dined here with my husband: two salads, two entrees, bread with roasted garlic and butter, two desserts, two coffees, and three cocktails. Our total bill was just under $100 (not including tip). He had the bacon-wrapped scallops with risotto, I had the mushroom and pear ravioli. Both meals were spectacular, and I was so impressed that I ripped a piece of paper off the table and wrote a little thank-you note to the chef. We will be back soon!",

    "text": "I'm not one to be too harsh on a restaurant (just see my other reviews) but there really is quite a list of things about this place that just doesn't quite add up to an overly good review.  I've been there several times, but I don't think I'll make it back.  How many passes can I give?  The majority of this review is for my most recent visit.  The atmosphere is pretty good actually: dimly lit, nice furniture, quality physical environment.  And the wait staff is friendly enough.  But for some reason (upon which I will later theorize) there are rarely many customers in the place, and unfortunately the sparse crowd takes the atmosphere down a notch or two.  We ate at the bar most recently, and although the bartender was courteous, I definitely got the impression that he was trying to project competence more than he was actually competent.  As we took our seats, he immediately asked what kind of beer we liked.  He said they \"have a great selection\" and he said that he could steer us in the right direction, spoken as though he had some expertise to offer.  But when I said that I liked stouts, he immediately \"guided\" me to what I fully knew to be a dark colored ale, saying \"if you like stouts, then you should love this one.  It's really dark.\"  So he clearly didn't have even very basic beer knowledge despite his initial attempt to give that impression.  At least he made a decent Manhattan, for which I finally opted. (It turned out there was no stout, nor even a porter on tap - and I don't call that a \"great selection.\")  One more thing: later when he cleared our remaining food plates away, he also took my still half-full glass of water, even though my companion had just ordered a brand new beer, leaving me to sit with nothing in front of me for the last half hour.  I didn't bother asking for another glass, partly out of feeling awkward and not wanting to make him feel dumb.  Didn't it occur to him that I might like to at least sip on something while we sat there for the next 30 minutes?  On to the food, which I can only describe as tending toward mediocre at best.  The guy in the back is allegedly a chef, and the plating is often of the elaborate style of a higher end restaurant.  Large white plates, food situated just so in the center.  From what I can tell, the appetizers are normally plated as such; although for the main courses, the portions are often bigger.  But let's face it; neither presentation nor portion size matters when the food is bland, undercooked, overly herbed/spiced, or otherwise poorly or unappealingly prepared.  And unfortunately, much of the food I've eaten here fits one of those categories.  The french fries are the stringy curly variety - \"julienned\" - a style which tends towards greasy for fries, but these are also bland.  Sure they kind of look unique - gourmet I guess they're shooting for - but I simply couldn't get enough salt on them to actually make them tasty.  And when I asked for ketchup, the bartender brought a tiny cup of it for our two large plates of fries.  Apparently they think those kinds of fries are easy to dip - or they think it is more sophisticated to serve ketchup that way.  Neither of those ideas work.  This is getting long, so to briefly cover several visits:   The goat cheese appetizer: very good.  The French onion soup: very good.  The mushroom appetizer: completely undercooked - some mushrooms nearly raw. The fish sandwich: bland (especially the bun) but inexplicably even the siracha sauce couldn't lend it flavor.   The chicken sandwich: ok, but not overly flavorful.   A previous visit's salmon entree: decent, but extraordinarily small serving for the price.  A previous chicken/pasta entree: very unappealing - the chicken was bland and actually came with a huge bone in it, sitting in the middle of a pasta dish?  Weird.  To summarize:  high end prices for average food and okay service that fancies itself classy.  No wonder the crowd is normally light.",

Maybe not your traditional \"brunch\" offerings, but all really tasty (including a fresh hummus with a pepper jam on top), a fresh sesame green bean, crostini, pasta salad, muffins, brownies). Each was really tasty and indicative of the effort and creativity of the chef.   For the menu items there were two omelette options; two waffle options -- sweet with berries and whipped cream, and savory with fried chicken, sausage gravy, and good maple syrup; a roasted veggie frittata; a \"breakfast burger\" (burger with bacan and egg on it!); a soft shell crab option; and the salmon option on the menu was replaced with a scallop offering that looked delicious.  We both had the chicken waffles which were REALLY good.  We'd have expected to pay twice as much for the quality and quantity.  Service was also great -- attentive and friendly.  They also have a full bar if you want to really make it a nap-inducing meal.",

    "text": "Went on a Saturday Evening.  We only tried the appetizers since we had  not been before so figured we'd just  test the waters, by having some drinks and apps.  Very pleasantly surprised. Good craft  beer selection,  about 8 taps not all nutcase super high gravity either. I did note that there were none of the IC-Light Bud etc on draft, ( I'm sure they are there in bottle for those so inclined) but  this give me another sense of \"They are trying with the drink selections\" and aiming for a dining establishment with a good pub atmosphere rather than the prior places which were basically \"North hills cheesy bar with some ok pub grub\". All very subjective, but heck that's what a review is all about.  Nice looking  spirits selection too, Mcallen 12 years on display shows some class in my book.  Wines by the glass at pretty reasonable prices  sub $10 , also a  reasonably drinkable Rose by the glass was on offer. Another touch of someone who \"get's it\".  Was a little  worried, figuring \"gotta kiss lots of frogs in this town to find a prince\" when dining, especially in the North Hills.  The location has hosted many of the same style of bar-food only pub/grille restaurants in the last 10 or more years, Magoos, Fiddlers, and places before.  This time the current owners and chef have made a difference.  We went early evening  so were worried it there might be some of the all-day drinking crown which I might have associated with the previous joints.  Nothing of the sort, nice casual atmosphere.  Prior to the food we were offered some  warm bread along with a half roasted garlic clove, along with some unsalted butter. A nice touch and pretty tasty too.  We had the \"Pig Wings\". Chunks of nicely crispy but tender  roasted pork done in the style of a lamb chop with the bone as a \"handle\".  Very inventive and super tasty.  Also tried the Mussels which were pretty tasty if not blown away by them.  There was also a \"chicken fingers\" with sesame seeds which was perfectly cooked and crisp yet moist, some form of sweetish dipping sauce with this.  Local mushrooms were well prepared, sauteed and perhaps roasted  but, too many button mushrooms for me. I'd have paid more for more wild variety.  We did not try the mains which did look pretty good, we were just testing the waters, looking for some nice apps and having a drink.  A fellow diners steak looked delicious and perfectly cooked and I regretted not jumping in with both feet for  one of the mains, which include Filet, or NY strip or Lamb  Overall. we liked what we saw and tasted  and we'll definitely be back to this little gem for a proper meal.",

It's very difficult finding local cuisine such as this.  I have eaten in many parts of the world in some of the best restaurants and this restaurant is doing all the right things.  I had one of the 'house favorites'; Applewood Bacon Wrapped Scallops accompanied by blue cheese risotto and snap peas.  The scallops were cooked just right and the bacon was a nice flavor addition.  The risotto was creamy with a light blue cheese flavor. The BEST. Crusty soft bread was served with roasted warm garlic. Pure perfection!!!  The service is very attentive and quite honestly most local restaurants lack this kind of service.  Do yourself a favor and dine at Bistro 9101.  I myself, will be back.",

    "text": "My fiance and I had been meaning to try this place because it is so close to home. We should have tried it sooner! We went during happy hour on a Friday night which was a great time to go to get some deals. They have half off all draft beers, $5 house wine, and a list of $5 martinis. They also have $5 appetizers that they call Bistro Bites. We had a couple of beers on draft, and the Bistro has a better selection than most restaurants. Especially if you like some craft brews. We then had the fried macaroni balls, a bocce ball(basically a meatball fried and served with marinara), and the bruschetta. I absolutely loved all 3 of them. My fiance did not prefer the bocce ball, but she loved everything else and she is a mac and cheese connoisseur . We then had a main course of the bacon wrapped scallops. Talk about melt in your mouth. They come with some snap peas and blue cheese risotto. It all was awesome. My one dislike is the ambiance and decoration inside wasn't the best, but the good makes up for it. We will definitely be back soon. I didn't catch our waitress's name, but she was great also!",

I realize they just opened a week ago, but the interior decor is definitely lacking.  I hope they have plans to spruce up the main dining room!  The bar area looks like it was renovated and had some nice red candles around - please, add some color pops to the dining area!!   Typically when we want to go somewhere nice but still stick to the North Hills area, we go to Willow.  The food was just as good at Bistro, but the atmosphere didn't match up.",

    "text": "Stopped in late night on a Saturday for drinks and appetizers before a movie. Perhaps this review would have more starts if I ate dinner because some of the items on the menu looked really good.   To drink I had the Mrs. McCandless. It was very pricey at $8 for a tiny drink but it was really tasty. The flavors complimented each other really well and it went down really smooth. One was enough to sip on over the course of our evening. my friend had the same drink but wanted a different type of gin since she doesn't like Bombay. The bar was accommodating with this request which is nice.   We shared the frites with the garlic parm seasoning. Awesome presentation but the taste left a bit to be desired. They were cut super thin, like...literally the thinnest french fries I have ever seen....literally the width of a toothpick. This made the plate look really full and was a different, eye catching presentation but in reality this super thin cut made the fries all crisp with really no potato taste or flavor. They were also REALLY hard to eat with any type of manners.   The Parmesan was sparse but the garlic was PLENTIFUL....and I love garlic but this was even a bit too much. When we got to the bottom of the plate there were a couple of large chunks which I thought was cheese but was actually cut garlic...WOW! I feel bad for my friends who had to sit by me at the movie after that.   They had a musician which was really nice when he was just playing guitar. When he started singing too I wished he would go back to just instrumental.   Overall, I think it's pricey for what it is but I'm always happy to support an independent place. I would return to try entrees.",

I was just trying to have a nice, relaxing dinner with my wife last night when the band played two songs insulting our current president Donald Trump. This is not a cheap restaurant and I expect more if I'm going to pay $20 per entree, such as a relaxing experience that does not make me feel uncomfortable. My wife and I were emotionally disturbed plus we are exhausted by the end of the week by what we already hear on the news channels. You have your right to do this but then put a sign out saying Democrats only tonight. I would have been more than happy to come back when that amazing guitarist who I listened to once on a Saturday. My point is I had no idea I was going to be forced to hear that because I assumed it fell under \" you don't talk politics and religion with strangers\" and most diners in a restaurant are strangers.  If the owner is reading this then I think you came to our table but I did not feel comfortable saying anything because everyone was enjoying themselves.  The food and waitress service was good but I really don't think I can chance coming to your restaurant again.",

    "text": "Right up front I'm going to say I rounded up from a 3.5 to a 4. Why? Because it here in the North Hills, any restaurant that goes to the lengths Bistro 9101 does to do things with the attention to detail that they do, deserves the benefit of the doubt. Besides, the food is solid, it was the bar that was a 3. On to the details.   The atmosphere is quiet on the restaurant side. Dimly lit by candlelight, the tables are spaced for intimate conversation without overhearing your neighbors. I like that!   The service is friendly, unobtrusive and knowledgeable. The staff knows their stuff about food allergy issues and what they don't know, they talk to the chef to get the right info.   How about the food? That is why we go out to eat, right? First, a small loaf of bread is brought to your table along with a whole head of soft, roasted garlic to squeeze out and spreatd onto slices of that warm, crusty bread. Such a lovely beginning!   My dining companion started with a rich and satisfying bowl of a not too creamy tomato basil soup that she said just hit the spot that cool evening. She followed soup with a crisp salad...sorry I don't remember which one, but she enjoyed it!   I wasn't hungry that evening so ordered two small plates instead of a big meal. The pig wings sounded quite interesting. These were small, meaty, very tender individual ribs served with a creamy version of a chimmichuri sauce and small soft corn tortillas. You spread a little sauce on the tortilla, then placed the pig wing on top, then gripped the meat with the tortilla so the meat slid right off the bone leaving the perfect pork and chimmichuri taco. It was almost a magic trick!   When I ordered two appetizers, intending a light meal, I never imagined the long beautiful plate of pig wings! The other small plate was a rich, creamy, delicious mushroom risotto that was prepared just the way risotto should be. I left stuffed, happy, and with leftovers for the next day!   Our return visit was later in the evening after a movie at the new Cinemark theater. This time we enjoyed cocktails and hangar steak quesadillas. The bartender had called in sick, so a server stepped up and filled the role as best he could. I give him credit for trying! He produced one very good Cosmo and one barely acceptable Mrs. McCandless - a specialty gin drink. I'll give a more accurate review of the bar when a real bartender is behind the stick!   One note, if you expect the same corner bar with the same cheap, so-so food and drinks that used to come out of this old building, things have changed for the BETTER! Yes, the new restaurant and new chef are cooking up fine cuisine that is pricier than the old shot and a beer place. That's why they USED to be here. Fine food is a welcome new addition to this old McCandless  location. This is my new local go-to spot!",

For the good, We started with decent bread and roasted garlic, which is a nice touch.  We both had Caesar salads which had freshly made croutons. Also decent.  Now for the bad. I ordered my filet extra rare (specifically still moo'ing) it was well done but still juicy and tender (surprisingly.) My husband ordered the rib eye, also rare, also came out well. We had the opportunity to send the meat back but chose not to. My roasted root vegetables were also more dehydrated than roasted. Everything was seasoned correctly just way over cooked. I don't have anything nice to say about the creme brulee, way over bruleed (needs to be caramel color not black) and zero flavor. Vanilla bean, lavender, Rosemary, infuse it with something! Texturally correct.   Wine list was inexpensive and contained many sweeter wines.   Waitstaff and location (rooftop was excellent) but building (especially roof and handrails in disrepair.)   Staff offered us a nightcap on the house because of the meat temps, but we declined as we did not want another beverage so they took dessert off instead (total was $81 after that.).

    "text": "My wife and I stopped by here on a Tuesday night for date night. We found this place in the Enjoy Pittsburgh book and decided to give it a whirl. Reading some of the previous Yelp reviews it seemed like service could be a little hit or miss. Walking in a little before 8 PM we found that we were the only patrons in the restaurant. Seemed strange to not have anyone else in the restaurant and we were seated fairly quickly by the host and brought water for drinks.  I ended up ordering the House Favorite Salmon and my wife ordered the pork chop. While we were waiting for our food we were brought bread and roasted garlic (my first time ever having roasted garlic). I found this to be a very nice touch and a cool experience to be eating roasted garlic gloves on my bread without getting the longing effect of bad garlic breath. The House Favorite Salmon usually comes with asparagus, but our waiter came out to ask if it was Ok to use zucchini instead. Not a problem and glad they asked! The Salmon ended up being incredible when it came out. It was artfully placed on a bed of pasta so that it wouldn't get soggy and the sauce it was in is incredible! I've only ever tasted a similar sauce two other places, pink pepper pasta at Combine Brothers and a soup at BD Mongolian Grill. I forget what ingredient gives it that incredible flavor (I think it is a pepper), and was very pleasantly surprised that this dish was made with it! The salmon ended up being a nice sized portion as well and during our meal the chef came out to greet us and ask us how we liked our dishes.   I found Bistro 9101 to be quite enjoyable and am glad we stopped by. If anything it might be a little bit pricey, but the food was delicious and portioned well, and the staff took care of us and made the extra effort to ensure everything was to our liking.",

We had buy one get one free for the House Specialty entrees and they had a live guitarist to serenade us with 60's and 70's classic rock which was a nice touch.  He didn't blast us out either which was much appreciated.  The service was terrific all night!  They have a few wines that rotate so you have to ask which ones are available that day.  I tried the Pinot Noir and the Pinot Grigio and both were very good.  They brought roasted garlic bulbs and some baguette that paired well with our wines but some of the bread was a little past due in taste.  We also ordered some roasted mushrooms which came in a large soup bowl serving size and was plenty with the bread and garlic.  For entrees, we both had the blackened salmon with asparagus that came over tomato cream sauce capellini.  The salmon was nicely cooked and moist with terrific searing.  It was not overly spicy as some blackened fish can be.  The asparagus was also perfectly cooked and the pasta paired pretty well with the fish although it sounded odd.  We both really enjoyed it.  For dessert, we tried their homemade strawberries in whipped cream over biscuits which offered a delightful salty balance to the sweet fresh berries and cream. It was excellent!  We shall certainly not hesitate to stop by again.",

    "text": "I stopped by here a couple of Friday nights ago with my wife and her parents for dinner.  My wife and I had been wanting to try Bistro 9101 since it moved in a few years ago.  However we had never found the time for it until this night.  We arrived to the restaurant at about 6:15 PM and after a somewhat awkward wait of a few minutes at a hostess station (the waiters, Bartender and others clearly saw us, pointed us out and no one did anything) we were given our choice of seats.  I chose a seat near the wall where we would have a view of the band that was scheduled to play at 7 PM.  We ended up enjoying the band that played on this evening as they were both good and played uptempo music which was enjoyable and suitable for a restaurant.  Think songs like \"Ho Hey\" by the Lumineers.  Anyways, Bistro 9101 has a somewhat old school feel to it between the dark carpet and all of the wood pillars.  They start you off here like most places with some bread.  What makes it worth mentioning is that with the bread and butter, they also give you a roasted clove of garlic.  I found this to be a nice touch and something that made it stand out a little.  There was even free refills on the bread and roasted garlic which I can't say that I was expecting.  In any case, for dinner on this evening I decided to go with the chicken piccata. It consisted of two pieces of breaded chicken with lemon sauce and capers on them as well as some red quinoa, asparagus and roasted yellow tomatoes.  The chicken here ended up being cooked well and I enjoyed the lemon sauce and saltiness from the capers.  That sauce and capers also happened to be on the quinoa which ended up making it enjoyable as well.  Last were the vegetables for the dish.  The asparagus was ok and nothing special really.  While I normally don't like tomatoes, I figured I would give these a try.  They actually weren't bad as they were slightly sweet and gave a burst of acidity.  Overall my meal was decent, I just wished that there was more of it, especially when taking into account the price.  The bottom line for me is that I would probably head back here again in the future.  While I am not so sure that I would order an entree, they did have a number of sandwiches that looked and sounded good.",

Specials would be a nice offering and a good way to move product as they never seem to be busy. The inside decor is kind of stuffy (?) they have white linen table cloths, it felt out of place. They are trying to do upscale food and trying to have an upscale establishment, but somehow I felt the vibe was off. The server Michael, was a kind man, but over looked freshening our drinks. The lights were really bright in the bar area and a band was playing. Pay attention to details....",

Today is mother's day and my family thought it would be nice to take my grandparents out to a restaurant. My family is very aware that it can be a little more difficult for us to get out as we have to travel with two wheelchairs.   As we arrive, we got my grandparents into the restaurant and sat in line for 25 minutes to be seated when we already had a reservation. The staff continued to seat other people in front of us, and the hostess informed us that the table where we were supposed to sit at had a reservation at 10:30 and was still sitting there. She said that the table \"looked\" like they were finishing up after we continued to wait for another 20 mins.   After waiting that long, we decided to leave as we could not keep my elderly grandparents waiting any longer. While we were leaving, the hostess ran after us and told us she could have seated us at a different table, but thought we would be more comfortable at a round table. Well then why didn't you and why are you making assumptions of what we would like. You don't know us at all.   In addition to all of that, their sign states that they are a brunch not a buffet, but they were only serving buffet food. Not too happy with the False advertising.   If this app had no stars as an option on this app, that's what I would have chosen. I don't care how good there food was or not, I will not be coming back.",

The steak looked like dog food (2/10). The frittes were probably the best part but still very low quality (3/10). I did not eat the mussels this time (was too disappointed with everything else). My GF said that the mussels are \"OK\" but I suspect she is lying to soothe my disappointment.  I would choose to eat Taco Bell over eating that steak again.

Their frites and bread with roasted garlic are also delicious!!! Service was outstanding and the atmosphere was nice with live music. We will definitely be back. Highly recommend.",
