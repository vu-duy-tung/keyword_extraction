Went in for drinks and dinner, had about an hour wait to get a table which was ok, got a table ordered food then the disaster started from there. Three of us all ordered the same thing fried catfish Po'boy sandwich , husband ordered a specialty burger all supposed to come with crab fries. Food comes, asked specifically for no tomatoes on sandwiches of course there were tomatoes on all of them, then my husbands burger wasn't even close to the burger he ordered , no crab fries for anyone and the worst of the worst I bit into my fish sandwich and it was literally raw uncooked rubbery fish.  The waiter whom I immediately informed of this told me \"well we are really busy and haven't had a concert for awhile \" THIS IS AN EXCUSE FOR SERVING ME RAW FOOD, we spent like $200 in this place. Plus it's right across from the Pittsburgh Pens arena with many many busy nights recently. Manager was an idiot with little customer service skills. Will never recommend this place or even go there.",

We've tried quite a bit, and it's all great. Highly recommend this place. Let's Go Pens!",

I understand they've just recent gone under new management from Blue Line Grill, but our experience was horrible. We had two different waitresses, the first took our appetizer order and then we didn't see her again until we were supposed to get our check. It took over 40 mins to get a margarita pizza and French toast delivered to our table, by then we were ready to leave. The manager was very polite and handled our complaints with maturity. They need to train their staff to ensure they have the appropriate skills for the quick paced restaurant environment. I miss Blue Line Grill...we won't be back to Buford's downtown for a long time, if ever.",

Our waiter was very nice and very accommodating he even made funny jokes when reading off the drink selection. Other reviews say that this place is busy but that is only because it is close to PPG Paints Arena and is often frequented by hockey fans before the Penguins game. However, if you go when the Penguins are not playing the restaurant is nice and quiet. The pizza was lovely and they were very accommodating with microwaving it as we let it get cold (this was our fault as we waited for the candidate to leave before eating so the pizza was sitting out for about an hour). The restaurant was very generous with condiments as well. The only problem I had with the restaurant was that one sink was not working in the bathroom and I had to use another one. I would highly recommend this restaurant!",

Tried ordering a root beer out... ginger ale out? So got a water with a dirty glass. Got an appetizer for the table brings out one thing of  silverware.  Will not be back again.

    "text": "This should really be a 2-star review, but I'm adding a star because our server was pretty nice, as well as patient with all of my questions. Aside from that, I had a few issues throughout our lunch.   First, I noticed that many of the tables were still dirty from the night before (we arrived 15 minutes after they opened). I had to brush large pieces of food off of our table and seats, so that kind of made me wonder how clean the kitchen was.   For our lunch, we ordered the pulled pork sandwich (which my husband said was just okay) and the fried green tomato grilled cheese (which was decent for a grilled cheese, but there was no real \"wow\" flavor to it and the tomato slice was so thin, I mostly noticed the breading). We both got a side of fries, but they initially brought me regular fries instead of the sweet potato fries that I ordered. They were also kind of lukewarm, so we just took them home to reheat later. We also got a side of Chile Spoon Bread, which I was told was like cornbread. It ended up being a tiny piece of cold, mushy bread pudding-like stuff. I expected it to be warm, but it definitely wasn't. Maybe that's how it's supposed to be? I definitely wasn't a fan.   We also ordered two milkshakes to go, which was the part of the meal that really annoyed me because I hate feeling like I'm getting screwed over in any way. The shakes came out and they were the size of a small drink at McDonald's. Based on photos I saw on-line, as well as the $6 price, I expected them to be bigger and even mentioned this to the server. She admitted that you get a lot more when you have the shake in the restaurant. When you order it to go, they only have small plastic cups, so you basically get half the serving. Why wouldn't she have mentioned that when I asked if they do shakes to go? And if the shakes must be significantly smaller, shouldn't they also be cheaper?  Or can't they afford to buy one more larger size cup? The shakes didn't even much flavor, so that made it worse. They were supposed to be salted caramel pretzel, but tasted more like plain vanilla with a few chunks of pretzel in it. I could have spent less money on a shake or Blizzard at DQ and been much happier.   Overall, I'd give the place one more chance since there aren't many places around my office, but I'll go in with low expectations and definitely won't be leaving with a shake.",

However, I asked for the breakfast menu and the waitress informed me they no longer served breakfast.  What a let down!!  Since I couldn't order breakfast, I chose the braised brisket with mashed potatoes and cornbread.  The brisket I was served was 90% fat with 10% dry meat that I could barely chew.  The cornbread was so dry it fell apart and I had to chase every bite with water.  I would have sent my meal back, but it was lunch and I did not have time to wait for a new meal.  I cannot believe the kitchen would even send out that type of \"meat\" and consider that acceptable for a $15 lunch.  Unfortunately, I will never return to Buford's again which is disappointing as it used to be my favorite lunch spot.",

The menu is a mix of comfort food that is perfect for the location catering to pens fans and pgh downtown happy hour patrons. Unfortunately, the staff is extremely unprofessional and you feel like you are there to get yelled at or get a poorly drawn tattoo.   Even the management seems like they have been plucked out of a bad 90's biker gang movie. From going there three different times with three different groups of people I can make the assessment from observation that the bartenders, waitstaff and manager are inarticulate, abrasive and reluctance to provide service.  The good reviews are most likely fake. Go to Easy Street in the oxford building for even better food and fabulous staff. If you are confined to close to that area pick Milano's for the pizza and subs, Red Ring or even Friday's.",

When the chicken basket finally came out, the sweet potato fries were cold and greasy.  Our bartender (sorry don't have her name) went to the kitchen and eventually a crisp, hot pile of goodness sprinkled liberally with brown sugar and cinnamon arrived.  These fries were so good we boasted about them to our friends.   The second time we went, we spent all day looking forward to the fries.  The place was a little more crowded (Toruk was at Consol).  Our service was good - Clint was attentive and even broke up the shared appetizer among 4 separate checks.  However, it was advertised that we could order all day from the breakfast menu - EXCEPT THIS TIME BECAUSE THERE WAS A SHOW!! - Seriously??? when else would you serve your entire menu????  When no one is there?!?!?  In addition, our beers were served in PLASTIC CUPS and the one ice tea came in a glass (go figure, cuz we can't), the sweet potato fries were bland (read - no brown sugar), the regular fries were undercooked, cold and greasy and the one sorry catfish plank in my meal was lukewarm, limp and overall just gross - I swear I tasted the 'Mon'.    What is really odd is that there are other food selections that are good - the fried green tomatoes, the chicken planks, and the nachos.  But, I would be willing to bet that most of this stuff came out of the freezer.",

You know then you shouldn't leave hungry. The shrimp were over cooked and it was like they tried to mask it with a ton of mayo.   The best advice I can offer you is to avoid this place.",

After about 15 minutes of attempting to get the attention of a server, bartender, hostess...heck, ANY employee, and failing, we decided to get up. Some people at the table next to us said \"that's why the women before you left; they never got served.\" While the employees were busy ignoring us, they were standing around texting and being generally inconsiderate. At one point, we tried to wave down a bartender and he looked right at us and walked away.",

Sadly, I have to echo what many others have said and give a lower rating because of so-so service. I went with a group of 3 others from work around 11:30a and it wasn't too busy so we were sat quickly. We all got waters which were brought out fairly quick.  3 decided to share the Buford Size Chicken Tenders while I got the Blackened Chicken Po'Boy after being told my original order of the Catfish Po'Boy couldn't be filled because hey we're out of Catfish on a Tuesday. It took a decent amount of time for our food to come out despite it not being busy and the sauces we asked for were not brought. We had to ask a second time for them. And even at that the waiter went off and did other things before finally bringing them. He even stated, I forgot again. We had a heck of a time getting his attention for refills and for the check.  It was just very apparent that we were not a top priority at the time and the waiter even commented that he had a lot of other work to do. It really took away from an otherwise excellent experience because the food was fantastic!  I highly recommend the Blackened Chicken Po'Boy with a side of Cajun Aioli sauce for the fries. It was so good. And with a $9 price tag it was a good value. And the Buford Size Chicken Tender Platter was massive!  I just wish the service could live up to the food. I'll give it another try sometime but for such a prime location I would expect more.  ***UPDATE***  I went back recently with a large group from work for a party and was much more pleased with the service this go around.  For a large group, our waitress did an excellent job over the course of a few hours.  We mostly stuck to appetizers and I really enjoyed the nachos.",

Anyway, I went to the door but before I could make it I felt a man's hand on my arm telling me to stop.

Being in uptown, there are a lot of creepy people who hit on young girls while walking down the street. While walking into the door there was a man about 10 feet from the front of the store who started saying \"ladiessss. Ladies. Ladies\". We figured this was just another man who was trying to talk to us so we kept walking. When we got into Buford's we stood at the bar and the man came up to us. We finally saw his shirt said security (though you could not see that outside because he had a sweatshirt on). We gave him our ID's and he was very rude because we didn't stop for him outside. He asked why we didn't stop and we said because we had already got heckled and thought he was just another creepy guy and he said \"why because I'm black?\". I was extremely offended by this comment. He made me out to be racist when I was just a 21 year old girl in uptown trying to be safe. He did not need to pull the race card. I don't care the race, gender, size, etc of someone on the street trying to talk to me. If I do not immediately recognize the person, I will not stop. He should have told us he needed to check our ID's or that he was the bouncer in the first place. Instead he made us uncomfortable by just saying \"ladies\". This is the first time we had been to Buford's at night so we had no idea they had a bouncer. The man never apologized and just said \"next time you better stop or I won't let you in\". That's fine with us because there won't be a next time.",

(Just to give a bit of background, nine of us made a reservation here last Thursday night for dinner at 6pm before seeing an 8pm show at Consol.)  -Entire table received their meals while one poor soul waited OVER AN HOUR for a sandwich, which was exactly like everyone else's, but for some reason took three times longer to make -Waited OVER AN HOUR for nachos, which I had to ask our waiter about and which were delivered ten minutes later... cold and very soggy (think, liquid chips) -Made clear that we had a show starting shortly and there was ZERO sense of urgency to deliver our food and give us our checks -Checks were delivered and were COMPLETELY WRONG, as if someone had gone to the computer and started randomly mashing buttons -Manager was called and appeared wearing a very unprofessional white strappy tank and black jogger pants, as if we had just woken her up from a Sunday afternoon nap -Absolutely no apologies were made for (1) delivering food very slowly, (2) screwing up all the checks and (3) making us late to our show -Waited... and waited... and WAITED for the checks to be processed, which took well over 10-15 minutes to run two credit cards and a gift card, thus making us late to our show  Now, let me pause for a moment... I am called \"namaste\" at work as I can bring calmness and coolness to any environment... except Buford's Kitchen, that is. So with that in mind...  -Stood next to manager and associate as they slowly processed checks, inquiring about their progress, and BEGAN TO ARGUE WITH THE MANAGER and had a gift card shoved in my face  Yep, that happened. Congrats, Buford Kitchen, for being my restaurant of choice if I had to make a recommendation to my worst enemy.  There is absolutely NO EXCUSE that they were entirely unprepared for a large crowd of people - and lots of reservations - before a show.  If you couldn't tell from the above, I will not be returning here ever again, even if the name changes again.  ***P.S. Thankful for a group of friends who quickly moved past the incident and still had a ton of fun at the show. Thanks, Jim Gaffigan, for saving the evening!  ***P.P.S. Still feeling badly for the table of six next to us who received their dinners at 8:05pm and discussed whether or not they should just leave. They probably literally missed over half the show...",

    "text": "We came to Buford's before going to a concert. Upon being seated our waiter came over and took our drink order. We were still waiting for 2 more in our party, but we were famished, so we ordered an appetizer. 20 minutes later our beers finally show up. We ask about the app and he says he will check on it. 30 minutes into our adventure with Buford's our app finally arrives at our table. But it was the wrong appetizer. We had ordered the Sweet Smothered Fries and he brought us the creole dip.   My fiance was seconds away from a hangry melt down so we told the waiter it was wrong, but we would keep it. Now, when you're THAT hungry everything tastes good, right? Wrong. The chips were stale. Tough, chewy, and not an ounce of crunchy salty goodness to them. Again, our waiter comes back, and I tell him. He takes the app out from in front of my now extremely hangry fiance.  Eventually the waiter did bring our first app and did not charge us for the incorrect dip. But they still charged us for the fries. Which feels as though its In poor taste for the amount of time we waited for them.   Now, you might be thinking, 6 PM on a Friday across from a venue that is hosting a concert. This place is probably extremely busy which would be understandable that we've been here 40 minutes and still have not been able to put our order in. Again, WRONG. There were people there, but many open tables.   Our other friends had arrived in this time so we wanted to put in our order. I ordered the Buford burger with Jack cheese and a fried green tomato and pickles. My fiance also ordered a burger with a jack and Coke milkshake and our other friend ordered a salad. 20 minutes later the food was on our table. Yet my burger had regular tomato... No fried green tomato.   At this point I was far too annoyed to say one more thing to our waiter. However my fiances milkshake had yet to arrive. He called our waiter over and the waiter said, and I quote, \"our milkshake guy just got off work and the next one hasn't come in yet.\"   So you have ONE person in the restaurant that can make milkshakes?!?!?!? Our waiter then went and made said milkshake (so I'm not sure WHY he didn't do this in the first place instead of making some sorry excuse).   Overall the food was average. My burger was a bit salty. The smothered fries were lacking. The chips were stale. The shake was tasty!!! But not worth the hassle. We will not be returning and I do not recommend coming here.",

Its supposed to come with lettuce and tomato, i added grilled onions and bacon with a side of ranch. Got burger, even had a lil plastic thingy that said medium rare but they must have mixed mine up with someone who ordered theirs well done. Also had no lettuce or tomato, and no side of ranch. Meat was very dry and obviously no pink. I waited for waitress for 10 mins before she came back to finally bring me the missing items. Burger cold at this point. 10.50$! Not worth it at all.   Also my fathers burger was over cooked also.  Ordered Margarita pizza for 17$ and it tasted alright but it was really chincy and tomatoes were few and far in between. Maybe they should charge 8$ for pizza. That would have made it worth it.  Fried green tomatoes were actually pretty good.",

It hit the spot, but not much else seemed memorable. Overall, okay place for happy hour with friendly staff that will happily accommodate a big party.   Of note: A homeless guy came around to all the tables asking for handouts. Very strange that the staff didn't put a kibosh on that. Made us feel a tad uncomfortable.",

    "text": "Recently my friend Greg and I wanted to go out to lunch. He usually works overnights so it is rare that we have a day off together. I will say that last Friday was the day that the stars aligned and we were able to enjoy a nice lunch out on the town. We wanted to do something new and something that we haven't tried before. Since we both work and live in the Lawrenceville/Bloomfield area we wanted to go outside of our comfort zone. I was working at Mercy and on my way to Shadyside was just voice texting him restaurants that I was passing on Forbes Ave. Of course he was sleeping and did not get the texts until later but once he did he said that Buford's Kitchen seems nice. I agreed. What is weird is that as an elite Yelper I actually did not read any of their reviews other than to use the app to send him the address. I was astounded to see that after we went their it has such a negative Yelp status. Honestly, that is CRAZY to me. Greg and I had a wonderful time here. The staff was so helpful and nice, the restaurant was super clean, and the food was fantastic. We even ordered drinks and they not only came out quickly when I was asking about a beer Greg ordered the waitress brought over the bar manager to tell me a little bit about it. What great service!!  The waitress we had took the time to go over her favorites and the best sellers of the restaurant. She was wonderful. And all of our picks were spot on because of her.  Appetizer:  Fried Green Tomato with Remoulade Sauce, Scallion Aioli. There were 4 slices of tomatoes on the platter that came out. They were drizzled with the remoulade and aioli and they were delish. I think that the tomatoes could have been a bit of a thicker slice but overall they were filling. I think also for the price there could have been maybe double the amount of tomatoes on the plate. Green tomatoes are not that expensive and with them being so thin, add a few more to the plate!  Andouille Gumbo: This was dang tooting good. I think I could have licked the plate clean and I even mentioned to the waitress to not be shocked if she saw me licking the bowl. The rue that the gumbo was made in was spot on, the sausage tasted amazing, and the who experience was magnificent. I had a cup, should have went with a bowl.  Main Course:  I ordered the Po' Boy for my main food. Because if you are going to try the southern restaurant you better have a heck of a good po' boy. I picked the Oyster po' boy because oysters are one of my favorite foods and fried oysters as just amazing. The po' boy came with lettuce, tomato, mayo, and pickles. I added extra tomatoes and onions to my sandwich because I am difficult and I love tomatoes and onions. I will say that standard the sandwich comes with fries, The waitress said we could sub it out for any of the sides on the menu. Again this is where good service comes in. I asked her how the coleslaw was because I am a bit of a coleslaw snob. I do not like like weird coleslaw or slaw that is made with miracle whip (which is disgusting in my book). She went to the back and got me a little serving dish of the coleslaw for me and Greg to try. That is wonderful service. I hated it so was grateful for her allowing me to try it out. I went with the mixed veggies instead. I will say, I asked what the veggies were and she told me broccoli, carrots, and something else. When it came out it was just zucchini, squash, and onions. Not at all my jam. I ate them and looked longingly at Greg's fries. I would not have picked that as a nice side veggie to eat but since I ate all the fried food, it was ok. I will also say that the veggies were caked in butter. They must be steamed or cooked in a ton of butter. I was a little taken aback by the amount of butter in the bowl, but just kind of went with it.   The service and the food were wonderful. I would come back any day. I think that it is a nice little lunch spot and the service is excellent. I look forward to eating some more of their meals!",

Buford's used to be called the Blue Line Grille, and the outside still has the old sign.  From what we heard, they literally transformed their menu a few weeks ago from a Southern style food to burgers and comfort food.  Ducks Radio guy Steve Carroll stopped by to chat with the fans, and we each got 2 tickets for almost any drink we wanted, from beer to cocktails to Pepsi items.  In addition, the fans got to pick 2 squares in the Road Crew SB Pool, to win autographed pucks and other Duck prizes.  The Road Crew ordered plenty of food: pizza, chicken strips, pasta, beef sliders. and we had a ton of food.  I wouldn't say it was the best food we've had from a bar, but Buford's Kitchen did a great job. Also, considering we had one person taking care of our group, our server was ok too.  Occasionally, he would forget an order, or bring the wrong drink, but overall, decent service, and decent bar food.  Overall, since we were far from California, it was a fun event, and we had a great time here.",

Prices are comparable with higher end, crowd is douchey and staff are rude and douchey as well. Food was mediocre at best. So many amazing, locally owned places in the 'Burgh to choose from so won't be going back.  UPDATE: Against better judgment I tried them again. Ordered a steak salad for delivery to my office which is a ten minute walk at most. Delivery time? 1 hour and 45 minutes. The salad finally arrived without French Fries (clearly states comes with fries), steak that I couldn't get my teeth through, green sour tomatoes and lettuce that looked dumped right from one of those bags you can buy at the grocery store. And top it off, it tasted filthy and dirt-like. Gross. $15 for a salad.  Do yourself a favor, AVOID!",

The bartender that put through the charge saw that my friends were still at the restaurant and let them know that he accidentally put through a charge and that it would be removed in two business days. On Wednesday I called the restaurant to let them know that the charge was still pending and it was hitting my available balance and because of that pending charge I was unable to use my credit card during the weekend I also let them know that I was very disturbed by what happened and that I expected them to correct their error immediately at that time I told them that Discover would need for them to call their Merchant services and they would remove the charge immediately. I was told by the manager that they didn't deal with the credit card companies directly but they will contact their credit card service people at no time did he ask for my name or my phone number nor did he apologize I even spoke to the bartender that made the error there was no apology. As of yesterday February 1 the charge is still pending not only did they not remove the charge nor have they apologized or done anything for my inconvenience. I plan to not return to Buford's . If you go use cash only! Bad customer service!",

A friend in our group asked the hostess how much longer it would be and she proceeded to do all but curse at her. She went into extensive detail about her personal life and then told my friend she was rude for asking when the table would be ready. We were finally seated and another hostess came over to \"apologize\" which was really just her way of saying \"you need to understand what she's going through\" and then called me rude for glancing down at my phone and stormed away. The rest of the evening she kept giving our table dirty looks. I've worked in the restaurant business and understand how stressful event days can be, but to be greeted and continually talked to in such a manner is not acceptable. I won't be coming back and I will be telling everyone not to go either.",

They have a lot of TVs and service is always pretty decent. The best part is the upstairs where they have a deck looking at the arena. There are heat lamps for when it gets chilly!  The food is where things get a little odd. Overall it is good food. Not great but not bad. Last night we had the chicken nachos, pretzels, and chicken fingers. The pretzels and cheese had zero flavor and tasted frozen. The BBQ chicken nachos were tasty with a good spice from the jalapenos! The chicken tenders are southern style with a nice kick also. They were a little under cooked for me, but my husband liked them. The menu is just strange. Before a game and at a bar, I want bar food. Like mozzarella sticks, wings, dips. However their food here is more entree style and they have speciality milkshakes. Just not really what you think of on game day.  This is definitely the best spot right by the stadium in terms of atmosphere, but if you are looking for bar food try elsewhere.",

My mom and I arrived shortly after and walked in, sat down and got waited on quickly. We were waiting for my cousin to arrive. When she arrived they wouldn't let her in due to \"being filled to capacity\". Meanwhile, there were 3 empty tables around us, empty seats at the bar, and 2 empty seats at our table. The hostess began arguing with me and said we can't let her in. I tried to explain that we already were seated and gave her the number of people in our party when we arrived along with the numerous empty seats. She replied with I seated you and wasn't aware of the number. When we told her she didn't seat us she changed her story to her daughter seated us. I asked for the manager and was told he was dealing with an allergy issue. I told her I would wait. She never got the manager or sent him over to our table. My cousin ended up getting in after waiting awhile. This hostess was very rude and had no understanding of parties with multiple guests who were meeting up for a concert after a day of working and arriving at all different times. Along with the fact I've been there for other concerts when it has been packed and had no problem getting in when it was standing room only. On a positive note, food was awesome! Waitress was awesome! Drinks were awesome! Prices were very reasonable! May return, may not. This hostess may have me think twice before returning due to the hassle she caused my family and I.",

This place is spacious, and can hold a crowd quite comfortably. Its outdoor terrace and proximity to PPG Arena earns it 5 stars, but they are quickly taken away because of the things Buford's doesn't have going for it.  The menu is not very appealing, food ordered lacked any flavor. Our server didn't seem to understand the concept of waiting on tables, which led to a low tab on his part. Not so sure how soup is any harder to serve over a milkshake, but it became a struggle to get.  TV monitors around the bar area are blocked by low hanging lights, thus causing one to have neck pain by the time the game you are trying to watch is over.  It became annoying to constantly wonder what just occurred on the screen due to your field of vision being blocked.  Take my advice about your visit to Buford's to watch a game, go, but focus on sitting in an area that offers a clear view of the TV, settle on the beverage options, and make sure your server knows how to smile.",

    "text": "Let's start with the bad...  It was BUSY...!  BUT, that was completely understandable because we were there prior to a Penguins game who play directly across the street...    The GOOD...  their food, their service, their prices...    Got there about 6pm w Penguins tickets in hand.  Checked in at the hostess stand and gave them my cell number so they could text me when a table was ready (I like this- who wants to carry a funky transponder around w them) and we were told it would be 20 mins (pretty good since the place was packed).  We found a spot at the bar and ordered 2 beers.  By the time I paid for them I had a text saying the table was ready.  We were seated in the 'map' room towards the back that had walls covered w Pgh area maps.  We were immediately greeted by Mikey who introduced himself and made some menu recommendations.  Being that we were headed to the game we ordered simple things- Pulled Pork Nachos & Chicken and Fries. Our food arrived in about 10 minutes.  The nachos were stuffed in the middle with tons of pork & cheese, salsa & sour cream sprinkled around and BBQ sauce drizzled all over. They were delicious!  See my pic.  Next was the Chicken (tenders) and fries. The fries were only room temp because (as Mikey explained) they're cooked in 'batches' and we must have gotten them towards the old end.  He offered fresh, hot fries but we declined.  He brought them anyway, we LOVED THAT.  The tenders... OH THE TENDERS...!  These were full thick strips of breast meat fried perfectly.  They were the best chicken tenders either of us have ever had!  Mikey comped a draft beer for our 'fry issue' which was very fair.  The place started to clear out and Mikey stopped for a few mins to chat.  He was very friendly and really made us feel appreciated for stopping in.  We left with the promise to return, and we certainly will...",

We're seated and told, after we order drinks, that they won't split a check for more than 4 people. Now this is an understandable policy when it is crowded. Not when it is empty. We inquire as to whether or not we can just split up to which we were told no. Waitress was very rude and this is just pure laziness.",

When we finally got our drinks the server walked off before we can place our food order. After we got a chance to place our food it was a very long time before it came out. The order was incorrect but since we waited forever I didn't send it back.  On another occasion I inquired about rental the terrace for an event. The person at the desk didn't have a clue. I asked for a manager there wasn't one onsite so I left my information and never received a call. Again the food is good but the service can use work.",

One great bartender, little guy, awesome, the rest are completely ignorant and spend a lot of time avoiding patrons. Most of the waitresses and the female manager/bouncer look and act miserable. Big rush to get u in and out. Don't know what ownership took over since Blue Line closed, but this is the WORST bar in PGH.",

The food is mediocre at best - nothing was horrible, but for the price, it should have been wayyy better.  Also, a person in my party ordered a salad - and it was served with half-rotten cucumbers sitting right on top!  We saw it right away when they set it down - it was disgusting.  There is no way that the person making the salad could have missed it - they just didn't care and served it anyway!  It's convenient enough for events, but that's the only reason why people go there.",

The bar has ice cold dispensers (the bottles are upside down into ice) for some shots. Ordered the Chick'n Fries from the Dis'n Dat part of the menu and holy moly - really great! The chicken is FRESH and not processed, never frozen! Really nicely fried. We split an order which had three pieces on top some fresh fries. If you bring in more people, you can receive more bang for your buck and get lots more chicken and fries. Highly recommend for some great food.",

    "text": "Have been to this location several times because of its proximity to PPG Arena for shows and concerts.  Not the same restaurant. Has been taken over by a chain. There is also a Terrace Bar associated in the building on the upper floors.  I called to verify in advance if the Terrace Bar would be open and if they would take reservations  and was informed they do not take reservations for either the Terrace or Buford's Kitchen.  Arrived with plenty of time but was informed the Terrace bar was not open and restaurant was only 30% occupied so for lack of options we stayed.  Server Landon took drink orders promptly for the 2 out of 5 ladies as the others visited the ladies room before sitting.  Took 20 minutes and two prompts to ask him to return for remainder of drink orders.   When asked on the second prompt his response was \" I just got three tables and I am slammed\".  But he took the orders of all recently seated tables before returning to us.  First round that was served had 3 bugs in a plastic glass which was returned to the bar for replacement since he never returned.  Second group of drinks ordered didn't come for another 15 min until the manager was notified.  Food order was prompt however missing one item and wasn't completed until right before leaving. The quality was average but edible for the price.   Also there is \"valet \" parking but it is not affiliated with the restaurant and they do not have a good relationship.  Can't tell you if they are going to show up or how to arrange accommodations.   Will never return. Treated poorly and didn't appreciate the lack of service or attitude.",

    "text": "Went to Buford's for lunch today on an unseasonably warm February due in part to the opened garage doors. Even though the place wasn't too busy we waited for about 10 min to get seated. We finally gave up and decided to eat at the bar. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken sandwich with coleslaw. The bartender/hostess/waitress was doing everything as they appeared to be very understaffed. She was extremely nice, but she could only do so much. A few patrons in for the Flyers game also sat at the bar, but decided to leave when the wait was too long. The food however came out really quick and the sandwich was decent. However, we waited forever for our check. We were anxious to get out in the sun on our way back to work. The bartender/hostess/waitress apologized and explained that they didn't expect this large of a crowd for lunch, but due to the weather it was busier than expected. In closing, the place really needs to staff accordingly as this has been an ongoing issue. Kudos to the bartender/waitress/hostess who didn't lose her cool and did was she could. It's a very nice restaurant with great tv's for a sporting event with decent food. Their staffing issues is the only thing holding it back.",

I ordered a Full Pint White Lightning that was on tap, only to be told that the keg was out and they were carrying Full Pint Festivus.  That is a seasonal winter beer, this is JULY.  It took one of the three bartenders 30 mins to realize we still hadn't ordered food.  Once we ordered, we sat there waiting long periods of time to get our drink refills.  I understand that it was a busy night but your customers are waiting for a drink and you are taking their empty glasses away without asking to refill them? Weird.  After we got our food, we weren't given any plates, napkins or silverware and had to flag a bartender down to get this.  Once we finished our food we had enough and asked to cash out.  I signed for a total of $62 on my check.  When checking my bank account the next week I saw that Bufords had taken 72$ out of my account.  Thus, someone added an extra 10$ to my bill - FRAUD!!!!! I called to complain and talk about this matter but no one would ever call me back.  Absolutely would never spend a dime in here again.",
