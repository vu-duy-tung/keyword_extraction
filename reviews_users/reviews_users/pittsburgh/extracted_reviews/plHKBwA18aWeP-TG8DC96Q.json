It's a $15 corking fee. No thanks. Oh and desert is isn't everyday. What the heck is that!!??? We won't be coming back as often.",

However, it is not that good to be treated the way I witnessed they treated several customers tonight.  After waiting for an hour and seeing we still had 8 people in front of us, we decided to get it to go.  Told it would be another 1/2 hr and would get texted when our food was ready.  After 1/2 hr and no text, decided to check status only to find our food had been bagged and lukewarm because they were too busy to text.  Saw other people miss the text message and were told that because they didn't come, they'd be put on bottom of the list.  With great restaurants popping up all over the area, if this service keeps up pretty soon you won't have to wait long at all to sit down because people will have chosen to go elsewhere like I will probably next time I am craving a decent taco.",

That was appreciated but point of going out for me is to spend relaxing time w friends w and having to bar hop in local neighborhood while waiting was frustrating. Plan ahead if you go for this type of arrangement. They are no longer BYB and do not allow guests to wait at their bar. You can order drinks while waiting in the lobby. I'm not a drinker and appetizers while waiting are not an option.  Menu is limited to tacos and sides. Cash only. What they offer is good. I would not say amazing but somewhat unique. Nice vegetarian selection. They have corn tortillas avail upon request of you are gluten free. The apple slaw very good and meatloaf taco special really interesting mix of flavors. One of our friends from NY commented atmosphere kinda like a Brooklyn skit. If you enjoy trendy place to explore may enjoy.  In the end not worth the wait for me but w right timing and plan may work for you.",

With so few good places to eat, that's why you wait! Service- waited two hours, ate dinner, had $100 in cocktails during that hour, and they shoved the check in our face so they could close and we were not the only table left. We would have had another drink. Our bill was around $150 for four. I will say their gin and tonic cocktail w/ St. Germaine is really good.",

Chips and cheese were so good, chips are made fresh and cheese dip is very tasty. Mac and cheese is good, it can easily be shared by two or even three as a side. Brisket taco was delicious and we had a special taco of the day, just a little on the spicy side but not too much. Flavored drinks like cantaloupe etc very good. BYOB so if you want alcohol there is a take out beer store next door. I was not disappointed at all and will definitely return. One very small criticism was they served room temp water before the meal and we were there on a hot humid day, ice water would have been appreciated.",

Smoke has a major pretentious hipster vibe, so much so that you actually have to know exactly where this place is and what's inside because there is no sign or markings outside...oy vey . Anyway, the place is nice although it's pretty small. Our server was nice but had the whole hipster \"we're too cool for you\" attitude and I don't think she ever made actual eye contact with us. The rest of the employees obviously have an affection for skinny jeans (are you sensing a pattern here?). As for the food, I ordered the special, which was a Cuban sandwich and fries and while good, it was overpriced at $12. My girlfriend got the ribs TACOS (which we thought would be plural, i.e. More than ONE). But alas for around 8 bucks (she added a scoop of avocado), she received ONE medium sized foil-wrapped taco on a metal tray. When it arrived we both immediately looked at each other, knowing exactly what the other was thinking. WAY, WAY, WAY overpriced for the quantity and quality received. If it had been April 1st, we would have thought we were being pranked. Total bill for our meal plus a draft beer and a coffee came to $32. Oh, and they only take cash, but fear not because the sign out front clearly says they have an \"ATM up in here\". I guess the PBR drinking crowd can't get a debit or credit card? If you're considering this place id say skip it unless you have cash burning a hole in your pocket and want to pay 10 bucks for some queso and chips, all while being trendily ignored, then I say go for it.",

Turns out the smoked beef here is from Australia (opposite of local!!) and is very, very lean.  The beef was sliced very thin and the portion was too small, about 1/4 the size of brisket portions at other restaurants.  The taste of the beef was above average, but not the best in Pittsburgh (try Smoq in Brookline for the best smoked brisket in Pittsburgh).  The beef slices were flanked by a few tablespoons of tiny chopped bits of more flavorful beef called \"burnt ends.\"  The BBQ sauces were very good, consistent with the restaurant's theme: unusual dishes with a lot of attention given to presenting flavorful and unique sauces.  The baked beans were outstanding.  They had robust and complex flavor, and they included beef burnt end crumbs.  If you like Austin baked beans, you will love the baked beans here; in my opinion they are the best in Pittsburgh.",

I tried the famous \"queso\" as appetizer which came with delicious buttery pita chips, broccolini and corn side dish (my favorite of the night!) and two tacos (brisket and chicken.apple). Being a Texas native it takes a lot to impress me with tacos, and I thought the ones I tried this time were OK, nothing crazy out of this world, but decently good. However, the broccolini and corn side was AMAZING and unlike anything I've ever tried before. My experience here was still great because of the fun ambienace and the great customer service. Tips: they don't have any gluten free beer unfortunately, and they are cash only as stated probably in other reviews, so bring yo !",

The taco was not really memorable.  This place does not even have burritos.  Better to go to chipotle and get something that will fill you up for $10.  Everything just seems overpriced.

My friend first told me about Smoke after I said I was disappointed with another restaurant's mac and cheese (which was a few weeks ago). Oooooeeeeee (you can tell I'm excited by this place) the mac and cheese was delightful. They call it a \"side\" on the menu, but the portion was generous and certainly \"shareable.\" The tacos were very big as well. They are served wrapped in foil which helps keep them warm. I got the pork taco with had delicious apricot habanero sauce. I really enjoyed the juxtaposition of the sweet and salty/spicy/savory. My friends were big fans of the chicken apple, BLT and brisket tacos. We got the chips and quest as well, the sauce is yummy without being too heavy and the chips were how all chips should be..  The restaurant is known as hipster and it felt very trendy.. like we were eating in NYC. While the interior is 'rustic' it was classy, clean and aesthetically pleasing. They have their own spin on things.. like instead of the stereotypical milk bottle water decanter, it was an etched vase like decanter with matching glasses. They have marquee lights on the brick walls and other cute knickknacks.  Cash only, doesn't seem to be BYOB anymore. Will be coming here again and again!!!! #ilovemacandcheese",

    "text": "I never had the pleasure of dining at Smoke while they were located in Homestead but finally stopped by their new(er) Lawrenceville location in August to pick up some tacos to-go for my husband's birthday.  My quick glance at the decor and brief interaction with an employee were all very positive. I had selected four tacos (the Pork, Chorizo, Chicken Apple, and Brisket, I think?) plus a side of queso and chips. I was a bit surprised when I was told the total - nearly $35, I believe - as I was expecting four tacos and a side to cost in the $25 range.  Unfortunately, my husband arrived home later than I had expected, so I didn't get to try any of the tacos as hot or as fresh as I had hoped. I kept the foil wrappers tightly closed, and we dug in as soon as he came home. Smoke delivers big flavors in little bites, and I can definitely understand their popularity. However, I actually felt that they delivered too much flavor at times, to the point where it felt like a spicy, muddled mess in my mouth. I am a huge fan of queso and was excited to try theirs. The base white cheese was smooth and creamy and delicious, but I was disappointed to hit a pepper so spicy that my mouth was numb for a few minutes. I thought that I was possibly crazy until my husband had the exact same experience (and he really enjoys spicy food).  Overall, I had a good enough experience to be intrigued enough to give Smoke another try, but they aren't currently at the top of my list of must-go-to places at this time.",

We put our name in at 710, we were told an hour to an hour and a half wait, they don't have reservations and are all cash. We were fine with the wait and expected it ahead of time. We were put on a wait list and were told they would text us when the table was ready. We went down the road for drinks because that's a long wait and the restaurant is tiny. After 2 hours, we finally walk back to the restaurant because we never heard from them. We ask the front desk person and she insists that we opted out of the wait list?! We were mad because we didn't and had the text from them to prove it! She was very rude and had an attitude the entire time. Anyways, she added us back to the list and told us it'd be 15 minutes, we waited at the bar and had drinks. Finally she came up to us with an attitude to tell us our table was ready. Once we sat, we took a look at the menu. It was very high priced for the type of food and amount. It was about $7.50 for one taco. If you wanted to add anything on it, it was an extra charge and all sides were an extra charge. A side of Mac came to $9! When the waitress arrived, she told us that they were out of anything that had ribs in it, we were pretty upset. It was one of the main things we had wanted. We ended up getting brisket Mac & brisket tacos. They were good and filling. Standard is averagely 2 tacos per person. The Mac is enough for two people for sure! We won't be back. It was nice for a one time visit but just not worth it.",

I've been going there since they were located in homestead. Was worried over time it would become not as good the more popular it got, but I was wrong!  Chicken apple taco, bacon Mac n cheese, and their queso are some of my favorites but have never had anything I didn't like.",

    "text": "We called ahead and they put us on the list...2 hour wait so they said they would text us when table was ready. We said we had five when we called ahead, but when we arrived they put us at a table for 4...the table was so tight one person had to eat at a corner and stand.  We did see a table for 6 open and requested to be moved, but they would not do that because they wanted to split it up to accommodate others who have been waiting....Strike 1.  After seated we waited 10 minutes to get menus, served water that was warm (no ice), was sitting near the front which had no air circulation and felt like AC was not running (but it was because other parts of place you can feel it), waited another 15 minutes to place order...in the meantime I went to the bar to get drinks and ice since no one seemed to be waiting on us....Strike 2.  Waitress came and took order...meal was served in about 15 min...but waitress did not even ask one time during the course of our meal if we wanted water, drinks, etc... Strike 3.  Now for the food quality...it was very good BBQ...but not worth wait!!!   You can serve the best food in the world, but if service is poor odds of me visiting again is very slim.  Also...at 8:00 PM on a Saturday they were out of Burnt Ends and BBQ Beans....how can a BBQ restaurant run out of those...should have plenty in holding ovens ready to go.",

    "text": "Finally got around to stopping by their new location for a weekday lunch, which admittedly is one of the best times to come without having to wait. I was a little confused upon arriving as they had, what seemed like, 3 hostesses around the entrance. The place was much larger than I expected but we quickly got a seat in the middle of the restaurant.  As others had suggested, we started with the queso which was delicious, as were the homemade chips. Large portion too.  I went with the Chicken and Brisket tacos for lunch which were good, although not as good as I remembered them from their Homestead days. Brisket was perfectly tender but incredibly salty during this trip - just a very overpowering taste.  I was tempted to try their mac n cheese as well, but maybe next time.  Waitstaff was pleasant but I don't understand the use of technology for technology-sake. Instead of discussing the menu and having a conversation, our waiter had his eyes fixed to his iPad for the entire ordering process. I'm sure it makes things easier for their cooks, but it added no value to the customers IMO.",

Fine, so we'll go on Saturday for lunch, we decide. Today, there was plenty of room but the host warned us that the kitchen was really backed up-- so much so that maybe we would like to come another time.   I appreciate the restaurant's popularity and the fact that they take the time they need to make great tacos. But at this point, we've written off Smoke because it's so hard to reasonably get in.",

    "text": "We were so obsessed with Smoke that we HAD to go back again for Father's day. This time, we brought the boyf's mom and dad as well. This experience- was a lot different than the first, unfortunately.  We started off with their queso- I had heard it was amazing and was super excited to try it. It definetly was a big bowl of cheese- the portion was pretty big and was enough to share with a larger group of people. But the flavor.. was lacking immensely. The cheese dip was almost completely flavorless besides the peppers and cilantro that were scarce throughout the dip. I took the leftover dip home and even doctoring it up didn't add much to it.. needless to say, I was very disappointed. The chips were homemade, which I greatly appreciated, but were also flavorless. My boyfriend's mom loved them though, so I gave her the remaining chips to take home.  One thing I don't like about this place that I didn't notice last time- they really don't have many drinks at all. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE that they are BYOB- it's completely awesome! But I didn't even think about their selection of non-alcoholic drinks. If I am not drinking alcohol at a restaurant, it's water for me, all of the time. But my boyfriend's parents always get pop and were a little disappointed that there were none available. They ordered their homemade lemonade and enjoyed it- but I do agree that some soda should be offered- even if it's only in glass bottle form.   Our entire party ordered 4 orders of mac & cheese and almost everyone ordered a taco. I ordered the chicken and apple taco that I loved so much the first time I had it (I had been dreaming about that taco ever since). My boyfriend ordered that as well. My boyfriend loved his- I was disappointed in mine. It was drenched in the smoked jalapeno mayo. To the point where it was a little difficult to eat. The mayo is delicious, don't get me wrong... but sometimes too much of a good thing, makes it not so good anymore. It took away the other flavors and just overpowered the entire taco. The mac & cheese was different this time too! It wasn't as flavorful as it was the last time. My sister (who admittedly is a picky eater) had a couple bites and couldn't eat any more. My dad enjoyed his. The one thing I will say is the portion of the mac & cheese is awesome- and I love the crumb filled top. My mom and dad had to doctor up their mac & cheese leftovers by adding a lot more flavor, since it lacked so much in that department. I did the same thing with my leftovers, which made the mac & cheese bearable. My boyfriend's family liked their food, but weren't blown away either.  I do not want to give this place 3 stars, but I have to. The fact that the two experiences at Smoke were so drastically different is super disappointing. The food should be consistent- not different each time you go.   I would like to return again, but I won't be running there anytime soon. Their desserts sound incredible and I have been too full each time I had visited to try any- so maybe dinner elsewhere and a drink and dessert at Smoke will be my next trip.",

The brisket was really good and so was their queso and chips. But It was also pretty pricey. Probably wouldn't go again.",

    "text": "Good food and drinks, but painfully slow and inattentive service. A friend and I came for dinner and drinks around 7pm on a Wednesday. The hostess was very nice, but was inexplicably overwhelmed and flustered. I know hosting can be stressful, but the restaurant is small and casual, and there were plenty of seats available. Perhaps they were short on staff (?), but this process was so much more difficult than it needed to be.  Once we were finally seated, it took at least 10+ minutes before we were acknowledged by wait staff or even given water. We were informed of the special taco of the evening (fried chicken), our drink order was taken, and we were then given more time to decide on food. I ordered a margarita and my friend ordered a beer. We also ordered the bean dip to split, and each ordered a taco (yes, one taco each, because that's what you get for $9). Our drinks then took another 10+ min.  The bean dip was ok, although I think it was literally just beans with a little cheese and one cilantro lead. I'm still not sure why it was served with toasted garlic bread rather than chips. Our tacos did come quickly and were rather good, thankfully. The pork was tasty and the tacos were a good size.  Once it was clear that we were slowing down, we were offered donuts that our waiter claimed were \"just out of the oven\"! We passed and just asked for the check (heads up that it's cash only). As we were about to leave, our waiter took our cash- which was clearly inclusive of tip dip due to the $1 bills on top- said \"I'll bring you change\", then ran off before I could object. He never came back.   I really wanted to like this place, but it just wasn't worth it. Their home-smoked meat was good, but not worth the slow service. If I were in the area again, I would not return.",

    "text": "My friend and I wanted to go Coca Cafe for Saturday brunch, but the wait was outrageous and we were starving, so we ventured down Butler Street. We came across Smoke, saw it was open and had to stop in (It's been on my to do list for ages, my friends rave about it). And it was such a good decision.  We ordered the chips and queso to start - and it's the most delicious, fluffy warm pitas that you've ever had and the queso, I don't even have words for. Maybe we were just extra hangover hungry, but I think it's really just that good. And the best part? There's an equal proportion of pitas to dip (which never happens). And you get tons of it - I probably could have just eaten that and been fine.  But, we also ordered tacos. I ordered the chicken and the special of the day, the Gringo. They were absolutely amazing. I took the chicken one home and ate it drunk at 3am; just as good then. Yum. My friend had the veggie and the brisket (she'd been before and referred to the brisket taco as \"her first real orgasm\" - so maybe you should try it). I can't describe how good the food is, I don't even like spicy, but I dealt with the (probably minimum, but i'm just a baby) spice to eat every last bite. Delicious. And so satisfying.    My only criticisms - the water was lukewarm. Ice in the carafe would have been wonderful. it wasn't horrible, it just could have been colder. But, that could also be due to our waitress - she really could have been so much better. Not that friendly, not that helpful, didn't check on us at all and never refilled our water. Halfway through, a guy started helping us - handed us our check, got us to-go bags, etc. He was warm, friendly and hillarious - so like anywhere, it just depends. Also, cash only killllls me.  Our tab ended up being $34 for four tacos and chips/queso. I definitely loved this place and will definitely be coming back. Apparently some days, you can get Smoke to go and take it next door to see a movie at Row House. Awesome.",

    "text": "This is the letter that I wrote and mailed to the management staff at Smoke.   August 4, 2016   To whom it may concern,  I am a huge fan of Smoke, but I am writing this letter to in regards to an experience I had at Smoke last night. Three friends and myself came to Smoke for dinner last night for our friend's birthday. When we arrived at 7 p.m., we were told that the wait would be between 45 minutes- 1 hour and that we would be texted whenever our table was ready. We walked around Lawrenceville, and around 8 p.m., we decided to start walking back towards Smoke as our wait time was nearing 1 hour. (We did not receive a text yet.) When we came back in, we inquired about how much longer our wait would be. The greeter said our group was the next group of 4 to be seated, and it would be about 20 more minutes. We were a little annoyed at this point, but we decided we would wait, as this was the first time at Smoke for two of my friends. We saw a group of 4 leave, so we were thinking that we would be seated after the table was cleaned off. After about ten minutes, the table was finally cleaned off and the greeter escorted another group of 4 to the table. So, we went back up to the greeter and asked what happened since we thought we were the next group to be seated. He said he didn't know what happened and that he was very sorry, but we were the next group to be seated. He again assured us that people were getting their checks and would be leaving. Again, after about another 20 minutes or so, another group of 4 left and that table was cleaned off. And again, another group of 4 was lead back to a table. At this point, when the greeter came back, we just looked at him, confused. He started scrolling on his iPad and kept saying he was sorry and how backed up the kitchen was tonight. At this point, we were ready to go, but also wanted to stay because of how much time we had invested. (It's about 8:45 at this point). The greeter comes over and says he will talk to his manager to see what he can do because he was so sorry. He came back and said there will be an order of chips and queso delivered to our table as soon as we sit down. I'm guessing that took longer than expected because a waitress brought the chips, queso, and water out to the table we were sitting at in the waiting area. As we were eating the chips and queso, she came back around to take our orders and assured us our food would be ready right when we sat down at a table. We placed our orders and continued to wait. Finally, around 9:15 p.m., we were seated at our table and like promised, our food came right out. The taste of your food hasn't missed a beat, but the service sure has. I'm writing this letter because I'm been coming to Smoke since the Homestead days. Whenever I come to Smoke, I expect a wait, but ever since coming to Lawrenceville, this process has gone completely downhill.  I came here when Smoke first opened in Lawrenceville, and the service was really slow then too, but I attributed it to being newly opened and trying to work things out. When Smoke first opened in Lawrenceville, I was also told that Smoke would be on the No Wait app, but that still hasn't happened. I really do love the atmosphere and the food at Smoke, but if I ever come back again, it would just be to get takeout.  I went onto Yelp last night after I got home, and noticed many recent reviews on there have been about the same issues I addressed above.  I hope you don't take offense to this letter, but rather find the root of the problem, and work to fix it.  I wish you all the best in the future.   Thanks for taking the time to read this.",

The Dining room was not full, in fact, people were walking out and tables were left empty, but no one was being seated. About half an hour into wait time, the hostess apologized for the wait and said that she couldn't seat us until she got the 'go ahead' from the kitchen. 10 minutes later, another woman came to the hostess and told her she could seat only 3 people at a time, and the wait one for every 3 person group was 20 minutes. I don't know what's going on with this place, but it's the second time that we've been here and they have kitchen issues. The tacos are good, but the kitchen just cannot seem to get their act together. Very unprofessional.

The waitress wasn't very nice when asked about the delay in serving my order. The place was only half full. Maybe others have had the same experience I had and made the same decision not to go back",

Each had such a unique flavor and something so delicious. A well done taco unlike other tacos in Pgh for sure. (I've eaten many a taco). Definitely hit these guys up on your way through.

    "text": "I give this a 2.5/5  I will list the Cons First  #1.) Long Wait Time For Food after ordering. #2.) Prices on the Higher Side #3.) We went on a Tuesday which is burger night, meaning only burgers are on the menu. Limited burger and appetizer selection.  #4.) House-Made ketchup served only, it taste like a cheap mozzarella stick marina. Quit the hipster act and at least have Heinz available as an option.  #5.) I asked for a small side of BBQ sauce, a 1 oz portion cost me an additional $1.25. #6.) No Reservations allowed #7.) Cash Only and you can't split up a check. Not the Most convenient but there are plenty of ATM's around #8.) Very Small Glasses for water - and instead of giving the table your own pitcher of water like other restaurants have implemented, you have to wait a little for refills. If you come thirsty be prepared to have at least 4 separate wait times because the glasses are small. #9.) Like much of Lawrencville, the design is completely rustic and hipstered out. Some people like it, some people don't. Although a restaurants looks are about my last priority when rating so take it with a grain of salt.  PROS:  #1.) After all of those Cons, the one thing that truly mattered the most was phenomenal. THE FOOD. After being disappointed in the burger only menu on Tuesday I will say this: One of the best burgers I've ever had. The Meat was perfectly cooked (medium), tender, and extraordinarily juicy.    The House Made American Cheese is unlike any other.  They load it on thick - but the fluffiness, meltyness, and overall deliciousness of the cheese make it a star.  You've got to try it, words don't do it justice.  The bacon was great, thick cut, although I'd like more than 2 pieces.  So the Burger was 10/10 on quality - so I don't mind the price too much.",

My friend got the Parmesan but it was more of an acquired taste(I took a bite but was not a fan). The ambiance is not bad either(avoid going after 6:30 that's when it gets crowded).Overall, I was very impressed, would definitely recommend it!",

Not a typical taco at all. Nice atmosphere- a bit hard to locate- no sign but right next to the Rowhouse theater.",

I ordered chicken tacos and pork tacos with house made pickles and both were really delicious. They're nice sized tacos too, I'd say two is a good idea but maybe 3 if you're ravenous. I liked the soft buttermilk tortillas as well, a nice change from corn tortillas! Smoke has a good beer selection too, always happy to see Hitchhiker beer on tap. Also want to mention the bartender was very friendly. Already planning our next trip to Smoke to try whatever we didn't get last night!",

Let's keep it real, your tacos are extremely expensive... you can afford to pay the credit card fees, but you refuse to accept them so you can squeeze out some more profit.

I've explored whole animals--brined, injected, rubbed, smoked, marinated, roasted, slow-cooked, hung up on a spit, cooked over rocks, or wood fires, or sous-vide until melting off the bone. I've had intimate meat-sweats from over indulgence everywhere from Oakland, California to Harlem, New York. I've ordered ahead to skip the line not to save time, but to make room to expand my extensive collection in an afternoon. I've complimented pickles in Austin, ordered extra potato salad in Penn Yan, and even pushed a layover further out to make a pit (beef) stop in Chapel Hill.  Every barbecue joint has it's own heroes. \"Get the turkey here,\" or \"try the char-grilled wings there,\" or even \"this joint rules, but stay away from the..\" I can't tell you the hero of Smoke. They're all so goddamn good.  Everything at smoke makes me so happy. At first, I would go out to their Homestead location and fill up on smoked wing night. Then, I'd bring a bottle of tequila to their Lawrenceville location to enjoy some margaritas (they would provide the mix) and a few tacos. Now, they have their own drinks, a rotating and legit beer list, and have managed to make every menu item just as good (if not better than) the one before it. The sides are perfect. I like the broccolini and corn, and the mac-and-cheese, and the potato salad. I also like the mac salad, and the cornbread, and I always make sure to get an extra plate of pickles. The burnt ends are my usual, but if there's a fried chicken special, get that one, too. Usually, we'll pick a few meats and maybe a sandwich and split it all.  You'll probably have to wait if you come in here for dinner, but it's worth the wait. It's also cash only, but they have an ATM in the back. When you're done eating, they'll probably tease you with whatever awesome desserts are on the menu. You could get dessert, or you could just order more meat instead.",

I came here when they first opened and was blown away by how good every single thing was. I figured that when I had a bad experience, it was just a bad night. It happens... and it happens again. During this visit I ordered a cocktail (can't remember the name) that had burboun,  lavender, and citrus. It was SO sour and tasted like nothing but unsweetened lemonade. No lavender flavors, and I could barely recognise that it contained burboun. I also got 2 tacos that I've gotten in the past, a mushroom & an egg taco. The mushroom taco was mostly refried black beans and has these awful burnt onions that were gritty and created the worst texture of any food I've ever had. The egg taco had burnt eggs and the potatoes that I was looking forward to tasting were sopping wet with grease and not even a little bit crispy. I figured, what the hell, at least I have this amazing mac & cheese. I have had a True LOVE for this mac, but this time it tasted like NOTHING. There was barely any cheese and it simply didn't have any flavor to it . My boyfriend for a chorizo taco and said that he couldn't even taste the meat that was in it. I can understand having a mediocre vegetarian dish at a BBQ joint, but to have tasteless meat? Unacceptable. I would have complained, but I feel like it was my own mistake for coming back expecting something amazing. It was about $60 for 4 tacos, a side of mac, 1 beer & 1 cocktail. I don't mind breaking the bank for good food, but this was NOT good food. Thank God I had that coupon and didn't pay full price. I will not be coming back here.",

After a long morning of hanging out at Crazy Mocha trying to job search and do homework I thought that coming here would be a nice stop on our way back home. I went there first while Chris was packing up to even see if we could get a table. I was told that they could get us a table in about 20 minutes. Awesome. Even better is that I got the reservation and they would text me when the table was ready. I went back to get Chris to tell him the good news!  When looking over the brunch menu we decide to skip it and just order straight from the main menu.   Appetizers: Mac: roasted garlic, shallots, mascarpone cheese & white cheddar topped with corn tortilla dust  This was incredible. The cheese was that toasted crunchy top. The tortilla dust was amazing. Just the right amount of dusting that didn't take away from the creaminess of the cheese. The server tried to warn us that it was a lot for two people, pshaw.... Chris and I did not finish it but we came dang close! This was a great starter for us. Super creamy and not salty at all. I loved the burnt top that Chris and I fought over. Nothing beats slightly burnt cheese stuck to the sides of a bowl.   Tacos: Brisket: sauteed onions, hot peppers & mustard sauce The mustard sauce really made this taco. I loved that it was spicy but did not have a weird vinagery taste that some mustard/bbq sauces have. The meat was cooked well and was not tough at all. The hot peppers, sigh, they were a little sparse. I would have had to eat half of the taco to get to the peppers. It seemed they were just on one side. I opened up the taco before and redistributed the peppers and onions.  I wish the brisket had more of a kick to it. I was told that the mustard sauce was spicy but it was not spread evenly on the taco to really get a good taste for it with the brisket. I also love sauces and would have liked to taste more of it on the taco.   Chicken: avocado cream, pickled onions & fresno hot sauce I thought that this taco was pretty good. I liked the chicken mixed with the pickled onions. I wish there were more onions though. I am a big fan of pickled anything so really, there were probably enough onions and I am just being greedy. I thought the chicken was cooked well, but it lacked any zing to it. The hot sauce and the avocado cream really had to be in this taco to make up for the lack of chicken zing.   Chicken Apple: bacon, cheddar & smoked jalapeno mayo Surprising. Really surprising. The apple really was a nice zing to this taco. I enjoyed the crunchiness of it and how the tart yet sweet tasted blended with the rest of the taco. I did not order this one for myself and can only say I took a taste. It was good!  Drinks: Lemonade: Fresh lemon juice, water & sugar Ginger-ade:Lemonade & fresh ginger syrup  I am going to lump both of these drinks together. 1.) Because they both tasted exactly the same. 2.) Fresh lemonade is always a treat and a must have when we go out and while good, it was not fresh lemonade good. 3.) For $4.00 a glass   (A REALLY SMALL GLASS) this will be a skip for us the next time.  I liked the experience and the food. I will say, it was a little bit too expensive for what we got. While good, I do not think we will be back anytime soon.",

My primary complaint is no corn shell tacos? What's up with that.  Their veg taco and cornbread is insane(ly good) but I've tried the pork and burnt ends taco and they just don't cut it for me. They're just not as flavorful as I thought they would be. Also they don't come with any fixings, it's just meat in a flour tortilla, bland wrapped in bland.",

    "text": "A party of five and an infant dined at Smoke today. We ordered the queso and chips appetizer which was good. I ordered a bacon, lettuce and tomato taco and the taco had a few bacon bits in it which I guess would technically be the bacon. I was not impressed with my $7 taco with lettuce and tomato. My husband and sons had the brisket tacos and they were dried out and not good. At the end of our meal the waitress offered us their homemade strawberry and cream cheese donuts. We got 6 to go and were charged $21.00 for the 6 donuts that tasted like BBQ and old grease. We called to complain after we got home today and they did agree to refund our money for the greasy, BBQ tasting doughnuts. Our check totaled over $137.00, plus a $28 tip.  Too expensive for tacos in my opinion.  I'll never return.",

Tried my friend's brisket cornbread...another oh man. The waitress was also very sweet to check on whether or not they had mimosas. Turns out they had a bottle of champagne on hand (don't know if they normally do) and got a hefty serving of one. That was a double thumbs up.   The only missing star is for the lack of menu. I wish they had more menu items! The word on the street is that they serve other things than tacos on the weekdays because they have to give their smoker a break. Aw man, you gotta be making those chicken and waffle tacos e'r-day. Would like to try a couple drinks next time!",

I prefer a restaurant that either takes reservations, or doesn't.  It's also cash-only.    Prices were a little high on extras.  I couldn't tell that there was avocado cream on my tacos at all, and I paid more for it.  The chorizo tacos were insanely spicy.  I expected heat and I love chorizo, but they were inedible.  However, the broccolini and corn was delicious.  The queso was tasty too.    In terms of drinks, they certainly put thought into pairings.  It's great for IPA and stout drinkers, but I'm not a fan and it would have been nice to have one lager or wheat beer available.",

At 8:00 our table still was not ready and the hostess was rude and definitely did not care, even rolled her eyes when we asked how much longer. We came back at 8:30pm, still no table (even though there were clearly two empty tables) and hostess seemed to had misplaced someone's food pick up order. After she found their food she said we'd be seated in two minutes, it's now 8:50, she went in back and then sat us a little after 9:00pm.   The queso with burnt ends was delicious and we enjoyed our margaritas. The tacos we ordered all seemed overly spicy, so much that we couldn't enjoy the flavor of the other ingredients.   A side note: Our server mentioned that it had been a slow night for business, to which we told her we waited almost 3 hours. She was shocked. Just felt very inefficient and poorly run.",

I've been hitting up burger Tuesdays for over a year and last time I went my waiter was an a**. He wouldn't let me make my burger the way I wanted it? Which I had been doing every other time I went. So when I said I was still going to place that order anyways he put his pen and paper away. Obvious that he wasn't happy with me. Then when he came back out with our food the order was wrong. So I didn't return for a few months. Then last night I tried again, thinking I'd be safe. Had the same waiter who told me the same thing. Then when I still ordered what I wanted he basically stopped coming to the table. Didn't offer us dessert. Just the checks. It will be awhile until I return again.",

    "text": "I was really excited to try Smoke. I loved their food when they were in Homestead and eagerly awaited their opening in Lawrenceville.  So, it took me 4 tries before I could even get some food to eat. The first time they ran out of food during a street festival. Totally understandable. The second time I stopped by on a Friday night around 6:30 and told that they were no longer seating for the night. Ok, it was a weekend night and there's a lot of hype surrounding this place so I get it. Would have been nice if they had a sign on the door so I didn't have to wait in line to be turned away. The third time I was quoted a 90+ minute wait for dinner and told that they weren't doing take-out. Really, 90 minutes for street food? I decided to try another time.  Finally, on a Sunday at 2pm I called to see if I could get a take-out order. I was quoted 45 minutes and decided to give it a go. However, it took well over 60 minutes to get 4 tacos. The restaurant was only half full, so I couldn't figure out why it would take so long for 4 tacos. I talked with the hostess and confirmed that yes, they do smoke the meats ahead of time. She explained that it takes them 10-15 minutes to prepare an order of 3 tacos and that they prepare orders one at a time; hence, the incredibly long wait time. This truly baffled my mind. How is it that the taco truck can whip out tacos faster than a restaurant with a full kitchen?  The tacos were ok, but definitely not worth waiting over an hour for. The quality has decreased since they were in Homestead. I really hope that they learn how to run their kitchen more efficiently and return to having the quality of tacos that they used to have. I won't be returning unless their service improves and their food quality returns to what it was at their previous location. Not worth a visit now.",

We went for a late lunch around 1:15PM on a Saturday, and waited about 20 minutes for a table.  The host provided us with our first round while we waited.  Unfortunately, the kitchen had run out of chicken by the time we sat.  Three of us shared the queso with chorizo which matched very nicely with what appeared to be pita chips made in house.  We each ordered two tacos (they're priced individually).  The waitress seemed to think we weren't ordering enough food, but we all ended up leaving with leftovers.  1 bloody mary, 3 beers, 5 tacos and queso w/ chorizo ended up being 88$ with 14$ tip.  I had the brisket and ribs, and I also tried a bite of the pork, and they were all delicious.  The brisket was by far my favorite.  The drawbacks of this restaurant are essentially its pretentiousness and subsequent high cost.  Our service was fair, but not up to par for the pricing of the food.",

    "text": "I was super excited to hear that Smoke had re-opened after a quite a hiatus.  I'll break my commentary down into three components for this one to be fair.  The Experience:  So, we started our on a bad foot.  After consulting Twitter/Facebook to find their address (an updated website would be a good start), we drove a couple circles around the 41st/42nd block of Butler Street looking for the building.  After a few attempts, we finally got out and walked it looking for a door number or sign, but no avail.  The only way we found it was a group of people walking out of the door we thought belonged to the neighboring theater with carry-out bags.  I'd suggest at least putting an address or a sign on the door (it would go a long way).  Getting inside, the place wasn't full, but we were told it would be around a 45 minute wait via NoWait (once again, it would of been nice to know they were using this anywhere on their site/social media presence).  Determined to give it a try, we waited about 30 minutes before being sat.  I will give Smoke props for their environment.  A good vibe, music selection and space lead to one of the more unique dining environments in Pittsburgh.  From here however, we had a varied ride.  The Service:  Approachable, yet brash (if that's even a possibility).  That's how I'd label the service.  Overlooking that factor, what really stood out here is HOW LONG it took for not only us, but all of the tables around us to get our food.  One hour for three tacos, mac & cheese and some slaw...  really?  The table to our left cancelled the remainder of their order and left and the two tables to our right complained pretty consistently about the time to receive their food as well.  Eventually our server brought out part of our order and apologized, but it still didn't make sense...  they're tacos.  The Food:  Here, I'll break it down into the good and the bad...  The Good - Brunch Special (biscuit and gravy), ChickenApple Taco and the Jalepeno Slaw.  While the gravy could have used a bit of seasoning (a consistent theme), the biscuit was rocking and the ChickenApple Taco was one of the more unique tacos I've ever had... kudos to those.  The Bad - The Migas Brisket (breakfast) Taco, Chorizo Taco and Mac and Cheese.  Once again, seasoning here would have saved these...  what should have been big flavor items ended up being super-bland.  For a smokehouse, I would of expected the brisket to be a lot better than it was and the Mac and Cheese could have used perhaps a few more stirs before being plated into the mini-cast-iron bowls (the flavor was pretty inconsistent bite-to-bite)  Overall, this has the makings of what could be a rocking place, but they need to get past the half-baked effort that we experienced.  We'll probably give it a few weeks for them update their sites, nail down their service and fine-tune their food, without some improvements, I don't see us going here again.",

    "text": "Smoke, in a nutshell is a hipster taco joint. It's delicious and if you are going to be hungry in the next 90 minutes, have some cash to burn and nothing to do in the next 2.5 hours, you should absolutely eat here. Everything I had was very enjoyable and I would definitely go back. I'm only giving it four stars because I feel like for what the place is, the service should be a bit faster considering most of the food is almost completely cooked beforehand and everything is pretty pricey (Cost a bit more than $60 for two people if you go all out).  Now for the details and helpful stuff: If you put your name down, they'll text you when your table is ready and since they don't serve drinks (though they allow you to BYOB), you can easily go to a neighboring bar while you wait for your table. They also have a fridge near the front door so you can keep your beer or other adult beverages cold while you wait/during your meal. And it's cash only but there are at least 3 ATM's within a block and they have one inside. The one at Commonwealth bank has a $3.50 fee. Note that though this is a casual restaurant, they serve you like you're eating at an upscale place--slow. So don't be afraid to order a lot because they'll make you pace yourself with the time between courses.  Now for the food: I was lucky enough to dine with some foodie friends and while I didn't take a bite of everyone's tacos, we did share flour tortilla chips, smoked salsa (this was a daily special), queso, the apple slaw, smoked cabbage, mac and cheese w/ brisket, and a berry pie topped with marscapone and cream cheese. I ate a chicken and a pork taco and had a bit of the brisket special taco (blue cheese sauce, tomatoes, other stuff).   Out of all of these things, the smoked salsa, chips and queso and the chicken taco were my favorites. The smoked salsa should be a regular menu item. It had a great blend of tomatoes, onions and peppers, left a strong smoke flavor in my mouth and left me feeling very excited to eat more smokey things. The chips paired with it very well. They are fried to order which makes them extra awesome, though that means you pay about $6 for them and you wait a bit. So be patient, they are worth it! We topped our queso w/ their house-made chorizo, which was also fantastic. Though it's more of a very good cheese dip versus queso. There are peppers in there but they don't add a lot of spice and no smoke comes through in the dish at all but whatever, this hipster cheese dip is a must-order.   I really liked both of my tacos and it's obvious that Smoke tries hard to build a great and well-thought out flavor profile in each and every taco. I enjoyed the chicken taco a bit more because it had the right ratio of meat to condiments/other dressings. The pork taco had a lot of pulled pork on it and while the pork was flavorful, I felt like I was eating a pulled pork sandwich but with a tortilla. The brisket special was good but had too much going on for my palate and it was super greasy.   The mac and cheese was good but I'm not sure if it was worth the $8 + $3 add on for the brisket. I enjoyed the brisket part of the mac and cheese the most (I'm totally getting a brisket taco next time), though the grease from the brisket didn't drip down and flavor the mac and cheese like I was hoping it'd do. I'm just not sure I would vote this my favorite restaurant mac and cheese, though it was good. The smoke cabbage was awesome! The smoke flavor wasn't too overwhelming and it had chunks of bacon or pancetta in it that really added to it. The apple/cabbage slaw was pretty refreshing and light compared to everything else we got though I think I should have added some salt to it. I would get this again.  The pie was pretty amazing. It was an open pie (no crust on top) with some heavenly mix of berries in it. It's a pretty healthy size so I'm glad we split it between 6 people. It's also $11 and if you order coffee, that's a $15 dessert. But I had nothing better to do and some money to burn, so it was all so worth it!  Finally, before I forget, they have fun flavored lemonades that could be elevated by booze. I'd recommend buying some airplane shots or just bringing a flask of gin, tequila or vodka with you. You can also purchase a pitcher of margarita mix for $15. Also, I heard that sometimes they have an 'ultimate taco' of the day which I believe are inspired by one of their line/prep cooks named Jesse. It's rumored that he's a great cook, totally fit and single.",

It is cash only which I find to be a nuisance...  Also BYOB, at least for now.  We started with the bowl of cheese.  It was delicious but we agreed that half the portion at half the price would be more suitable for two people.  The tacos were good.  We had chicken, pork, and brisket. I enjoyed the bbq flavors but found the tacos to be each a little one-noted for 6-7 bucks a pop.",

    "text": "Wow, this place was great!  We went on a Tuesday which, unbeknownst to us, was Burger night.  That meant a special menu of just burgers and a few select appetizers and sides.  At first I balked because I really wanted tacos and a margarita, but the charming hostess convinced me to stay.  She raved about the place and how everything was made from scratch - from the ketchup to the buns and even the cheese!!!  Plus the drink of the day was $5 hibiscus mojitos.  I couldn't pass it up, burgers it was.  Drinks were delivered promptly and they were fabulous - the tastiest cocktail, let alone mojito, I have had in a while.  I ordered the classic burger with cheese which came with fries.  Really rich, flavorful, and cooked perfectly.  The brioche bun made from scratch has probably spoiled me forever.  Fries were shoestring style - perfectly crisped and seasoned and the ketchup was not like your standard Heinz, but a rich tomatoey goodness with a really nice flavor.  I was impressed that it was all done from scratch and I ate every last morsel.  I'll be back to try the the tacos for sure, but if someone wants to know where to get a great burger on a Tuesday - I'll certainly recommend Smoke.",

    "text": "After much deliberation I decided on rating Smoke a 3 and not a 4 for a few reasons.  Let's start out with the not so good aspects of my experience and get it out of the way. This was my second time here, the first being a very short time after they opened. I remembered my first time as having waited almost an hour to get my food so I hadn't gone back in awhile, but decided to give it another shot.  When I walked in they were pretty busy, and I stood at the hostess stand for about 5 minutes without anyone coming up, so being alone, decided just to sit at the bar. A hostess approached me as I was sitting down and I asked if it was fine if I sat there to which she somewhat flippantly replied \"yea, I guess so\". A bartender did approach me right away and was very friendly, immediately telling me about the special that day- a chimmi churri chicken taco. After looking at the menu for a couple minutes I decided to get that and a side of broccolini and corn. The bartender took my order and I proceeded to wait...and wait...and wait. A half an hour later I finally got my one taco and veggie side. By this time I was ravenous. A few minutes into the wait the hostess came back up and proceeded to seat another single customer at the bar. To my right were two empty bar stools. To my left were 2 bar stools, one being taken up by my bookbag, another being taken up by a different patron's coat. Instead of seating her on one of the empty stools she said \"here, you can seat at either of these stools\" without even acknowledging the coat or bag. Of course, we both removed our item so the woman could sit, but it was just odd to choose those seats when there were empty ones right beside me. Another thing that I felt was slightly ridiculous was the cocktail prices were higher than most of the food. Getting one drink would've almost doubled my bill. Even the wine was $10 a glass. Some of them sounded great, but I'm really not interested in getting a $12 dollar drink to go with my taco I'm eating off of a tin tray.  As far as the food goes, the taco was delicious. I would hope so, since it was $7.50. (For one taco!) It was the size you would expect a taco to be, nothing out of the ordinary. The side of broccolini and corn was tasty, but very stemmy.  The bar staff was great, checking in on me twice, making sure I had water and seeing if I needed anything. I did remember from my first visit that it used to be BYOB, and I asked if it still was. I was told you could bring your own bottle of wine (only) and there was a $15 corking fee.  $15?! That's more expensive than a lot of bottles themselves! I've never heard of a corkage fee that high and I've worked at several places that had them.  The decor was beautiful - industrial and rustic at the same time. The women's bathroom was very clean. Maybe someday I'll go again if I decide I need a fancy taco night, there were plenty of things on the menu that sounded great. But I'll have to save my money and make sure I have nothing going on for the next hour and a half.",

    "text": "Went on a Saturday around 5:30pm with a group of 5.  Because they don't use NoWait our plan was to show up, get on the list, and then go next door to Bierport and wait 40+ minutes for a table.  That's our standard plan when trying to get a table at Smoke.  Miraculously we didn't need to this time, as they were able to seat us right away.  Smoke definitely has some of the best tacos in the city of Pittsburgh and they have vegetarian options.  The Veggie option is a solid choice for those so inclined, but a lot of my friends went for the Migas this time around.  If you go meat, you really can't go wrong.  The Chickenapple is a personal favorite, but I've also had the Brisket one and it's another great choice.  You also should not overlook the sides at this place.  We get a few to share amongst ourselves.  The Brocolini and Corn is a great option.  I have friends that swear by the Jalapeno Apple Slaw and others that go the Mac route. No matter what you chose you will not make a mistake.  The only reason this place doesn't have five stars is the lack of NoWait.  Given how crowded this place gets the wait is a killer.  Until they adopt it, do like we do.  Show up about 45 minutes before you want to eat and then kill some time over at Bierport's taproom downstairs.",

    "text": "This place was suggested by a friend as a small group of us was spending the night out and about in Lawrenceville.  It was a Thursday evening and there was no wait when we came in at 6...though it's small and did quickly fill up.  The service was...sufficient.  Not the friendliest, but not necessarily rude.  Attentive in terms of refills and whatnot, but just not the warmest or most welcoming.  We all thought the food was excellent.  With the influx of taco restaurants in Pittsburgh any more, I was skeptical of $7 for a taco.  That being said, the taco was YUUUGE!  I'm a big eater, and the two tacos I got more than filled me up.  Stuffed with lots of delicious smoked meats.  I would have been more than satisfied with one taco and a side of beans or a veg.  The only thing I sampled (and we all sampled quite a bit from each other) that I wouldn't order again was the burnt ends taco.  I typically like burnt ends, but the combination of that plus the barbecue sauce, which I believe was coffee based or accented, was just too much of an overwhelmingly smokey flavor.  Cocktails were on par for most decent restaurants anymore.  Be aware that it is cash only, and the entire restaurant smells like smoke (duh).  I'm pretty sure my dogs thought that a beef brisket walked in the door when I got home.  Also, I was prepared with layers of clothes because most restaurants have the a/c cranked up and I'm wimpy when it comes to that.  However, I don't think they have a/c, because it was super-warm in there.  I prefer it that way, but just tossing that out there.  Probably give this 3 1/2 stars, but I decided to round up based on the fact that I'd definitely go back.",

The burgers: we both got the More Deluxer done medium well. I wanted to swim in the bacon jam. My friend took a bite of my burger after he was done with his and mentioned that he thought it tasted completely different than the meat on his burger - he actually said his tasted more like brisket than a burger (he wasn't upset!). The fries aren't my favorite, and were fairly cold when they arrived at our table. And while I applaud the homemade ketchup, it tasted like I was dipping my fries in spaghetti-os sauce.   Overall, I'd go back for the the burger but get a different side (if possible).",

I like to get the chicken and chicken apple. The meat is tender, and the flavors in the tacos are very well balanced. You always feel like you're getting a taste of all the ingredients, nothing is overpowering.   I love that on the Chicken Apple you can taste some apple, but the delicious cheese and bacon flavors are taking center stage next to the chicken.   The regular Chicken taco has a delicious spicy avocado sauce that adds a lot of flavor alongside the cilantro. Great for people who like some spice.   I also highly recommend getting a breakfast taco- my favorite is the egg because the combination of flavors is wonderful. There is definitely a sauce of some kind that really adds flavor to everything already in the taco.   And the BLT for me was a home run- again it isn't just the flavors listed- whatever sauce was added was perfect, it brought out the bacon in a good way. The bacon is homemade and tastes like it.   With all that said -$4 to $8 and sometimes $9 per taco is a bit ridiculous. And the fact that it's cash only as if we're saving money that way is a little ridiculous. When you can get a whole meal for $6 from a cash-only place like Pamela's- THAT is saving money.   But go here, eat the tacos. Because they're delicious.",

To start the atmosphere is nice and I appreciate the space being small and allowing intimate dining.  We started off with the house queso which is so delicious with its homemade chips. The queso is not your typical queso but it's packed with chicken, avocado, and delicious sauce.  Food wise, these tacos are literally some of best in the city. I've tried the pork and chorizo tacos and they are so amazing. The taco shells are so delicious and you can tell they are homemade.   The mac with burnt ends is amazing! The burnt ends are so delicious and full of flavors. This was a great surprise to the menu.  Hands down this place is a spot!!! Try it try it try it!!!",

    "text": "I've been here on three previous 4-star nights when visiting Pittsburgh, last week was a bit off though. The brisket was a little dry but that could be the cut. Just didn't pop in flavor like last year. I tried a veg taco also which was a creative mixture but was served cold. I think the beer offering could be expanded, it's a bit limited at present but I suspect it rotates so again this review just based on one visit. I enjoyed Smoke more when it was BYOB and I could take advantage of the bottle shop next door and it's larger beer selection. Perhaps you can still BYO I don't know though. All in all I would not hesitate to return - it's a fun atmosphere and the bartender did a great job based on all the feedback I overheard.",

    "text": "After years of hearing that I *need* to dine at Smoke, I finally found the perfect opportunity on a recent chilly Pittsburgh Saturday afternoon.  My friend and I stopped in for lunch and joined a couple of other solo diners at the large, wooden bar situated in the middle of the room.  The smoky smell that hits you as soon as you walk in is downright intoxicating.  Smoke offers a very broad menu and I thought I was going to have trouble deciding on what to get, until the bartender shared the day's specials with us.  There were several options but I blacked out as soon as the words \"Cuban taco\" left his mouth.  Two of my absolute favorite foods in one delicious mashup?  Umm YES PLEASE.  While we waited for our food, my friend and I each sipped on a house gin cocktail.  I was impressed with the taste and serving size and thought it aligned well with the $12 price tag.    The Cuban taco was everything I could've hoped and dreamed for.  Honestly, this needs to be on the regular menu.  I somehow managed to snap a photo of it for my Snapchat story before digging in, and I got SO many inquiries as to where I was.  The taco was pressed just like a real Cuban should be, making it somewhat of a quesadilla. Everything inside, from the meat to the pickles, was perfectly portioned and flavorful.  The taco itself was the just the right size for a lunch that wasn't overly filling.  I wanted to try the mac and cheese but I'm watching my carb intake (wahh) and thought better of it... this time at least.  Instead, my friend and I shared the broccolini and corn with brisket which was quite good!   I definitely see why people love this place and I'm glad I finally got to check it out without a 2 hour wait standing in my way.  Loved my meal, loved the cocktails... but for the love of God, put that Cuban taco on the menu!",

You can tell they make their own chips because they were a bit chewy opposed to churchy. They weren't bad, just different. Kind of pita like. I also had the brisket taco which was good but small and shared the Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was delicious and extra creamy. My favorite thing  was my drink though! I got the Agua Fresca and it was so refreshing!",

You walk in the door and you instantly get hungrier because the place smells amazing. The tacos tend to be on the spicy side so if you don't like spice this may not be the place for you. If you try to go here on the weekend the wait will be insanely long but the food is so good. You can check in and they will text you when it is ready but at certain point they start turning people down so I recommend trying to go during the week or lunch if you can.   It is worth the effort to try and find the place and to wait.",

And the chips that accompanied the dip were almost better than the dip itself. For my dinner I ordered the BLT with chicken taco and the brisket taco. BLT taco was made perfectly the brisket taco was way too spicy for me, which means a lot because I live for spicy food. We had macaroni and cheese as a side which was wonderfully creamy. When we were there it was during December and it was FREEZING. I wish it would have been warmer in the restaurant because I was shivering the entire time. They only accept cash but they have an ATM in the back of the restaurant and are located right next door to a PNC. Would definitely go back here again for the DIP and to try some different tacos.",

I've always been a fan of the burnt ends and this time did not disappoint.  I was very impressed with the chicken.  We have been to bbq places all over the country and have had a hard time with smoked chicken and dryness.  This chicken was the juiciest I have ever had!  We got the coffee and apricot habanero sauces which were both good, I just wish they would put all the sauces in squeeze bottles instead of having to choose 2 little containers of the 6-8 sauces.  For sides we got the cornbread and broccolini and corn.  I would pass on the cornbread, I like sweet cornbread and this was not sweet.  I seriously dream about the broccolini and corn on a regular basis I love it so much.",

I really enjoyed my steak taco, but am not sure I would have been willing to pay $6 under non-HH conditions (hence the imperfect rating). Still, as a SoCal native, I am having a hard time finding a taqueria that satisfies my craving for al pastor! In terms of upscale taco restaurants in Pittsburgh, I would wholeheartedly choose Smoke BBQ over Bakersfield or Condado. Also, Smoke is in a burgeoning neighborhood with several new restaurants that have opened up in the past few months.

Just imagining how good this place smells is enough to make me want to jump in my car and drive there. You will thank me after you go and have your own fantastic experience. The place is not large so you may have to wait but to assure you the wait is worth it. Make sure you bring cash with you as they don't accept credit cards here, but there is an ATM here. It also isn't he cheapest taco place you'll find but quality ingredients aren't inexpensive. We started with the queso. START WITH THE QUESO!!! You MUST get an order of queso, either regular or a doctored up version with burnt ends or pork. It is so cheesy...full of poblanos, Fresno chilies and onions and accompanied with homemade buttermilk tortillas that are fried to perfection. This is a very large portion for an appetizer too, between my husband and I we can barely get it down (but we are also saving room for tacos...) They also have handcrafted soda, $5/pop but totally tasty. We tried both the Burnt Ends and Chicken and Apple tacos. My husband(and I agree) That a waygu beef spoils you for ever eating another taco in your life. Tender, flavorful beyond belief meat and the coffee bbq sauce is just the right amount to make your tastebuds tingle. The chicken and Apple was also very good. This is another unique taco you just can't find everywhere. We also tried the mac and cheese side which was just mediocre in our opinion. Definitely not a bad dish, but when you're comparing it with everything else it pales. I'm telling you that you cannot go wrong with Smoke. There is street parking and also a paid parking lot just down a block across the street. No military discount here.",

I've been here many times as I live in the neighborhood, and the quality is consistently good. The wait time for a table is dicey (not sure if/when they'll begin taking reservations) and the wait time for food is a tad long, but so worth it. Meow!",

What you have is a place selling hipster food that does taste good, but certainly doesn't have much of a right to claim the hispanic/mexican cred contained in the word taqueria.  They played foreigner, Journey and Boston over the PA, and I'm certain nobody in the place- owner, server, chef or customer- spoke any Spanish at all. Which is fine- but don't call it a taqueria.  Call it a \"nouveau taco joint\" or something like that.",

After the blasphemous act of removing their BBQ plates from their menu; which was a divine meal if I have ever had one, I decided to return and try their tacos. It's noon on a Monday, and they are out of two signature items-their shrooms and their burnt ends. It is clear that they manipulate you into ordering their high margin items, which is unfortunate given the fact that their quality meals once brought me joy. I look forward to a competing BBQ eatery opening down the block in a matter of time, as they will certainly receive my visits at least thrice a week, as Smoke once did. These continuous acts of betrayal are nothing short of a travesty, and if not for the fact that I don't want the landlord to suffer from the loss of what is sure to be a high value lease, I look forward to their imminent demise.",

It's so worth the wait, you'll understand once you dig into these magical tacos. If you're really hungry you can't go wrong with queso and lightly fried pita chips.. They're a home run. For tacos my hands down favorite is the rib and close second is the chicken apple. If it's your first time I recommend trying both I just mentioned, the jalapeno mayo is amazing! Honestly be patient and you will be rewarded with amazing food, and yes the place is very 'hipster' but it's Lawrenceville, it's expected.

It's juicy and has the perfect burnt smoky taste and they pack so much meat in the tortilla it's quite filling. Also had the pork which was NOT quite as juicy, but dry actually, but still delicious. They let you do take out and so head over the Atlas Beer Works next door and grab a beer downstairs while you eat. It's the perfect relationship between the two stores. Also their Mac and cheese side, very delicious as well and you get a good portion of it as well.",

And after another 15 minutes, I get a call on my phone saying \"the owner's family\" is coming in and now they no longer have a table for us until 2 hours later.  I complained saying that I was counting upon them.  The answer I get back is that they don't take large groups until after 9 PM.  So, why are you telling us this now?  We gave up and asked them whether we could do a take out instead.  And they tell us it takes more than 1 hour to do the take out.  1 hour for a take out??  They rationalized it by saying that it takes longer to prepare a take out for a larger group.  Hmm.. really.  Moral: if you have a group larger than 4, best avoid this place.  Sure, they have decent food.  But there are plenty other places on butler street with good food AND service.",

The food remained phenomenal. I had the mac and cheese with ribs, which is listed under \"Sides\" but it is a good portion and I even had to bring half of mine home. I also ordered the Brisket taco, which was surprisingly spicy and delicious as well as the specialty taco of the day, which included chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes, gravy, and a sunny-side-up egg. My server warned me it would be a messy disaster, but would be totally worth it; he was right.  The only criticism I have of the new restaurant is that the servers use iPhones to take your order. I didn't like this. It feels almost rude to be talking to your server while they are playing on a phone, even though I know they are entering the order. It just seemed impersonal. I had not experienced this at another restaurant, and it is something I definitely dislike.  Other than that, the decor of the place is almost as good as the food, only because the food is so dang amazing. I love Smoke and will be back many times!",

For us that was not a problem. But from that moment on, everything with Smoke turned out to be a problem for them. First, we couldn't put our names down until all 9 of us were there, which unfortunately took a while. The receptionist was quite rude and unfriendly, but my friends decided that it's worth the wait. They told us it would be about 1.5 hours, so we headed to a bar first and then came back.  After coming back, they still made us wait for about 10 min, so we started looking at the menu in order to be able to pick everything straight away once seated. In the meantime my friend walked through to the bathroom, where the receptionist ran after him trying to stop him, telling him he's not a customer and not allowed to use the bathroom? It took some discussion that we are actually waiting to be seated.  I wasn't really impressed with the tacos they serve. I had 2 vegetarian options and added meat to it (as the vegetarian option seemed to have much more flavor to it). The portions as others have said are quite small for the price you pay, and I wasn't overly blown away by the quality and taste either. It's tacos that I can prepare myself at home and they would probably turn out better.  And in addition, the cash only is another thing that is quite annoying with Smoke.  All in all, I am definitely not rushing back as there are so many better options for dinner in Lawrenceville. And in my opinion Smoke definitely does not live up to its reviews/hype.",

Brisket was good, a little dry, and the pork was good but I've had better. One of our friends had brisket and chicken tacos, they must have been great cause he devoured them before I could steal any!

I have been here 3 times so far, each time is even better than the last.  THEY ARE CASH ONLY, BE PREPARED, BRING ENOUGH FOR A TIP, TAKE OUT THE EXTRA 20, YOU'LL THANK ME YOU DID.",

We were placed on their NoWait list--but oddly enough, you can't add yourself to the list from home--you have to check in in person first Drinks: decent beer at decent prices. Kind of odd they didn't have an accessible list of drafts. Had to walk to the other end of the restaurant to see the draft list. Dinner: They were out of multiple items from the menu. I ordered the brisket and my husband got the ribs. My brisket came out lukewarm and sparse. Husbands ribs were super salty, but tasty. The best part were the sides--mac and cheese and baked beans Dessert: we both got glazed donuts. They weren't donuts...it was basically a fried and glazed hamburger bun. Would not get again...yuck!  I'll try it again--but wasn't floored right out the gate!",

I feel like Smoke has been on my list for ages, but with the ridiculous wait times there always seems to be an easier option. I'm happy to have tried it during a non-peak time!   We walked in and were given a choice of seating by the host. She was a bit snappish, but I brushed it off. We chose the bar. The bartender was super friendly. She took our food orders and was quite attentive at the start of our visit. I had the pork taco and my friend had one of the chicken tacos and a side of some sort. I believe it had corn and asparagus. My taco was divine. It had juicy chunks of shredded pork with a flavorful BBQ sauce and some sauteed onions. Everything worked well together without being too messy. Two would have been a full meal for me, but one was perfect for the light dinner I was craving. The beer list looked great, and I will be taking advantage of it in the near future.   We didn't end up receiving a check, so we just left cash plus a tip on the bar. I wish someone would have checked in and asked us how we liked our food and such, but that's my only complaint. The staff was clearly preparing for the dinner rush and had other things to do. At any rate, the food was delicious and I can't wait to go back!",

Taco wise I got the burnt ends (amazing) and the BLT with chicken (this was a little too spicy for me).

I was appalled by the actions of waiting customers and the demeanor of management allowing such inappropriate behavior in their establishment. They were borderline instigating an altercation.

    "text": "Smoke is the go-to date night for my wife and me - if your're trying to get a feel for Lawrenceville and the Pittsburgh food scene, this is the place.  Hipster restaurant in every way at its finest; we're talking exposed brick, hole-in-the-wall type exposed lighting, unique mixed drinks, interesting/exotic additions to each dish, and of course tattooed servers.    Speaking of the drinks, the agua fresca drinks are a great way to start.  Each day they rotate the fresh fruit juice base and mix it with your choice of gin or vodka to spice it up..  Whenever the mango is an option, I will bypass ordering a beer and go for one of these every time.   Appetizers are great here too. When I'm with friends, they insist on the queso which is top-notch nachos (leave it to the hipsters to make simple nachos amazing). Just a thick floury cheese with a bit of a kick and some quality pitas.  This isn't your classic plate of store-bought chips drizzled with cheese and jalapenos on a checkered paper in a basket, this is art. When it is just my wife and me however, we go for the burnt ends which may be my favorite dish here.  Somehow they manage to get the juiciest pulled pork but perfectly crisp each strand's end so that its as soft as butter but as crispy as potato chips simultaneously.  If I had to recommend one dish - this is the one.  For the main course I have tried all the tacos and keep coming back to the pork as the taco of choice.  The chicken apple bacon is a crowd please but is a little less exciting than the pork, gringo or brisket.  So if you are feeling safe and want a delicious taco, go for the CAB, but if you want something with a kick and chock-full of flavor, try these other ones.  Amazing sauces in each one and honestly not a taco you'll find anywhere else.  Wish the place wasn't cash only, and as others have mentioned, there are no reservations so the line/wait can take some time if you don't get it right.  But hey, they're hipsters, what else would you expect?",

Staff are friendly and always willing to explain the menu and tell what is gluten free and not. Only complaint is that you have to pay with cash (which we always forget).

    "text": "My friend and I decided to have a girls night out and picked Smoke. This review will have 2 parts. Food, and management aspects.  First the food. During our insane wait in the packed but small waiting area, one of the diners came out and offered us (the waiting public- now friends because we had bonded) her bag of chips. Most of us were 1-2 drinks in and were ready to eat our coats, so we snagged the chips. The magical, incredible chips. When we were seated we had another cocktail. These drinks are fantastic and incredibly mixed using flavors such as lavender, blackberry and cucumber. The queso- unique and divine. The tacos? Ridiculously fresh and fabulous. We had a beef and a chicken and I can't pick which was better because they were both incredible. The mac&cheese was so rich and delicious but we were both too stuffed to eat much of it. So for food and drinks Smoke scores at the absolute top.  If the operations at Smoke ran smoothly they would be overrun with patrons and they would have to open other locations because they are that good. That being said, here is my perception of our visit. First, the piece of paper on the door that says SMOKE was not visible from the street, so we drove past it 4 times. Here's the deal- there are too few people working and when they come back from the employee area (which should be used for seating-seriously) they are inefficient. 2 girls were trying to deal with an inefficient seating system, juggling phones, getting drinks, wiping tables, taking names, and dealing with people checking on where they were on the list. We were seated after about an hour, but according to the text system we weren't supposed to be seated until 7 minutes before we left. It's a hot mess. So call before you get there to put your name in. Call when you are parking. Call when you are walking in the door. Then enjoy some awesome drinks and food!",

The atmosphere was pretty cool, I think they could probably add a few more tables to help cut down on the wait. The food depends on what you order. The brisket taco was delicious, the pork was pretty good and the BLT wasn't great. The tacos were pricey so we all ordered two and then ordered queso for the table.  The fried tortilla/pita chips that came with the queso were really good but the queso was more watery/wet than I have ever seen.  Overall, the food was pretty good but for the price, I would not go back.",

Their Queso is actually making my mouth water thinking about it, it's that good, and the \"chips\" they serve it with is the best part.

We went on a Tuesday evening, which I did not know means \"burger night.\" I was still looking forward to my meal, even though it wasn't going to be tacos. Cheeseburgers are actually my favorite food. Unfortunately, we were very dissatisfied with our meal. The flavor was mediocre. It smelled great in the restaurant. However, there was about a half a cup of grease that leaked onto the dish and about a half a cup that entered my gut from the burger. The fries were yummy, but they were soaked in vinegar which did not sit well with the aforementioned grease. My fiance and I were both sick from the grease the next day (and believe me I have had my fair share of bloody burgers-it was not because of an intolerance to red meat). There is also very very limited ability to customize the burger. There's basically only one option and it's not at all worth the $14 dollars they charge. Also, it was very very loud inside. We could barely talk because the music was playing so loudly.   Overall I rated it two stars because I HOPE their tacos are better than their burgers. I am giving this place the benefit of the doubt. Avoid Tuesday's though.",

Also they got a huge smoker like to smoke the foods all day long low and slow. I watched them in the kitchen due to it being an open kitchen it was a pretty neat site. The smoker is nice they say it contains rotating racks for everything. Our food was awhile but that's due to the freshness. They got flavored water drinks that they let me sample! All made from scratch too. The chorizo if you like spicy food I recommend it. It's real nice and tender they do Sautee it just till it done. Mine was not over cooked which is good. Also l, the flavored watermelon was nice and very refreshing. Espicially on a hot day after a bike ride. The lemonade was not too lemony not too sugary either they found an awesome balance! Next, holy mac and cheese was huge, it was enough for us three. It had mascara one and sharp cheddar. The sharp cheese gave it a nice bite and it a nice beautiful crunch. Now let me start on the chorizo, very flavorful great combo of ingredients very spicy I say like a 6 or 7 on a 1-10 spicy scale. But l was still able to thoroughly enjoy it came with pinto beans think tomatoes onion, it was a nice size taco too! It had awesom le stuffed fried nuggets as a bonus this a delightful restaurunt to go to yes it's far for me but  that's how much I love it and wana go back to it so bad! Overall, very amazed at this place oh everything is from scratch!",

I went for the pulled pork taco with slaw and the mac and cheese with burnt ends.  I thought the taco was very good, on a homemade tortilla and tender pork with a sweet bbq sauce.  I would recommend getting the slaw on it as it is a nice crunch and a nice saltiness to the sweet bbq sauce.  The mac and cheese is heavy and don't think I would have liked it if I did not add meat.  The burnt ends was super good and I loved the crunchiness on top of the mac and cheese.  It was a pretty big portion and definitely not just a side dish.",

Their queso is wonderful and they use a thicker pita-like chip. Beware, it's easy to get pretty full on just their chips and queso! They have lots of options as far as tacos, most recently had the rib and chicken/apple taco which were both great, slight preference towards the rib taco. You may think the prices are a bit high but I think the tacos are pretty big so I'd say they're actually priced fairly. The service is variable, wasn't very good today.",

The waiting time from seating to getting the food could be highly improved upon.   I started just ordering takeout to avoid the hassle but dine in occasionally. If the service doesn't bother you, I insist you go and order a philly chz steak brisket taco, it's not on the menu but it is fabulous. mac and cheese with bacon is also a major smacker!",

Fortunately, we returned and were greeted by an extremely friendly staff that made us feel at home.  It was like some friends got together and decided to invite a few more friends to enjoy their new take on tacos.  Fast forward, and now they're located in their current Lawrenceville location.  Same warm coziness that I got from the other location, but with more space.(Thank the Lord!)  My daughter Muff and my sister Luch were on our way back from a food event at the John Heinz History Center, but we still had a few empty pockets in our tummies that need to be filled with some delicious food.  Hence our trip to Smoke.  We wanted to keep things light (Hah!) and decided to go with the \"Burnt Ends\" dip, \"Rib\" dip, Chorizo taco and \"Gringo\" taco.  Whew!  Heads up!  Smoke doesn't serve traditional flour or corn tortillas, but they have their own unique buttermilk flour tortillas.  The recipe gives a slightly different chew to their tortillas and when fried, provides a little more heft to the tortilla chips than regular tortilla chips.  That extra heft doesn't take away from the chips at all and provides a better counter-balance to the heartier Burnt Ends and Rib dips.  You can't go wrong with burnt ends, buttermilk and bleu cheese!  And the Chorizo and \"Gringo\" (Ground sirloin and brisket with pico de gallo, avocado cream, cheddar and crispy tortilla crumbs) tacos were on point!  We left stuffed to the gills with no empty tummy pockets to be had!  It's a little pricey as far as tacos go, but definitely worth the trip!",

This isn't some orangey goop that tastes cheese-like... It is LOADED with cheese, and other things depending which kind you order. If you can, the Burnt Ends queso is life-changing, you should order it! It's got poblano peppers, pulled pork... All the good stuff. And I'm not a chips girl, but these were unique! They were crispy yet chewy, but also light and airy. Hands-down the best chips & queso! I had a Tom Collins, which was good, but what surprised me was their House-made Cola that my friend ordered. It tasted like an in-between of Cola and root beer. I don't even really like sodapop, but this was fantastic. Now... Let's talk Tacos! The special was a Fried Chicken taco with bacon and garlic mayo. This taco could have used a slight change to the ingredients ratio (both my friend and I agreed ours were dominated by the fried chicken).  The Shrooms Taco, however, was nothing short of glorious. The smoky, umami mushrooms were perfect in taste and texture. Everything else in the taco played nicely together and created a lively balance. 100% recommended! We left stuffed, but didn't regret a thing. I'm already planning on bringing my other friends to try this fantastic taco joint!",

The beef tips were AMAZING! The meat itself is so tender & had a great flavor. The chicken was spicy but a little dry. My only complaint with both of them is that there were more toppings; crema or a slaw (that you didn't have to pay an extra $1.50 for). My son got a kids size Mac and cheese & it was to die for.

The food was excellent, the service was good and the location is prime! The only cons are that it's cash only and doesn't accept reservations.",

The taco was good, but would probably try something different next time. I was expecting the jalapeno apple slaw to be spicier than it was- there was maybe 3 tiny pieces of a sliced jalapeno on top. I thought the food was over priced. Our server was super nice, but it did take a while for our food to come out.",

I got a horchata as well which was pretty good but not as milky as the typical horchata. Overall, it was alright but I probably wouldn't recommend it.",

    "text": "Lawrenceville. Hipster capitol USA. This area produces more beards, hats and casual shoes per capita than the entire gross domestic product of Zimbabwe. Needless to say I continued on. Smoke doesn't really have a sign on their establishment (and if there is one, than holy christ, it's camouflaged better than the Predator during peak hunting season). It's just there. If you aren't paying attention you'll walk right past it and into the cinema next door.  Now I have stumbled upon something amazing. It should be a discovery or some sort of anomaly only seen in some demented parallel universe. I'm not talking about the food. The food was actually pretty good. Friends, I come to you here and now in the year of our Lord two thousand and seventeen to discuss the waiting you will do at this restaurant. Yes, the waiting. In fact, if you are reading this there is an 80% likelihood that you are waiting to be seated at Smoke whilest standing in Industry Public House. Take a moment and let your brain process that. Yes, waiting in Industry to be seated at Smoke. This type of waiting goes beyond anything our civilization has seen. As I stood there I knew I was on a precipice of discovering the next common cliche. They give out noble peace prizes for these types of discoveries, I thought. Like some sort of tear in the fabric of space time, or discovering a new element in the periodic table, or experiencing deja vu in the Matrix. The waiting you do at doctors offices don't hold a candle to this place. It must be some sort of speak easy type of thing that only hipsters in Lawrenceville are privy to. I felt like an outsider having walked up and asked for a table when I should have, in reality, called 6 hours in advance. The brevity of the situation began to sink in. I thought to myself, who was I to have walked with an air of facking nonchalance to this place and asked for a table. 40 minutes turned to an hour, an hour turned to an 1 hour and 20 minutes. Time began to slow down. I witnessed the birth of the universe. It was only a Friday night, not Saturday but Friday. The yuppy crowd was long gone. It's closer now, I thought. Just a little longer, you are almost there. 2 hours passed and nothing. Even as I'm writing this I feel as though a part of me is still there at Smoke. I have to go back and rescue my memory that still lingers there. Dumbledore probably has it in a vile somewhere. Why is the wait time to be seated so long? It's tacos, people. You arent being served a 7 course meal. Are they hammering their own corn in the the back and making tortillas from scratch? That must be it. That's the answer I will give myself so I can sleep tonight.",

It's just that this place isn't.) This place is also slightly overpriced for the quality of the food; if it was a tad more refined, the prices would make more sense.   The only aspect that is quite dissimilar from a typical fast food joint is the speed of service. We didn't have any trouble getting seated like other reviewers. But, I can understand why people arriving later on would have to wait. The kitchen is not efficient enough to turn around tables quickly. Overall, it was worth trying out once, but not worth returning to.",

Went in for happy hour today after a muddy sloppy day at the US Open Oakmont. Very quiet due to the rainy weather. Great open brick Decor inside terrific bartenders who are knowledgeable on both food and drink.   Happy hour prices are great. Had a great local brew and two terrific $3 Sliders ..Brisket and Pork both with their slaw. Had a big crock of their baked beans which to me are best I will ever have anywhere....spicy and amazing!!  Tried my buddies smoked poblano peppers stuffed with sausage and topped with cheese in a terrific gravy they were amazing. Also tried the fried potato poppers that top their salad really really good interesting. I observed their kitchen crew a few times and I could see the care and preparation they put into their food. Lawrenceville is an interesting neighborhood still a long way to go ..nice eclectic downtown.",

    "text": "The food here is spectacular.  So why only a 3-star rating?  It's because of Smoke's disrespectful and blatant misuse of the NoWait system for getting a table.   When you call ahead (and yes, you're going to need to call ahead) for a table, they get your phone number, and you'll get a text message prompting you to install the NoWait app on your phone.  Normally, I avoid installing apps on my phone, but I figured I'd make an exception.  NoWait is kind of cool in that you can see how many parties are ahead of you, and what the estimated wait time is.   Well that seems nice, as I don't have to sit around waiting in the lobby of the restaurant.   It started out with 8 parties ahead of me with an estimated 60-75 minute wait.   Eventually it made it down to 6 parties ahead of me, but still with an estimated 60-75 minute wait.  And then I got a text saying that my table is ready, and if I don't get there within 10 minutes, they'll give the table to somebody else!  As I was running to the location, I glanced at my phone and there were still 6 parties ahead of me in line!  When we got to Smoke, they had mentioned that while they use NoWait for their own wait list management and also text notification system.  However, they do *NOT* use NoWait as it's *SUPPOSED* to be used by keeping the wait info updated.   The result is that everybody that uses NoWait to check on the wait status of Smoke is surprised.   So while the two of us made it in time, the other two in our party would not have been able to make it in the 10 minute window from having received the text message.   If we got back on the list, it would have been more than an additional hour to wait.   So we told them to not bother showing up.  Smoke:   Either use NoWait, and use it completely, or don't use it at all!   What you're doing now is disrespectful to the customers, and I could imagine it even causing yourselves undue headaches.   While we were waiting for our now 2-top opening, I overheard you explain the NoWait situation to pretty much everybody else who showed up.  How does this not get old to you, and how have you not realized that it's a problem?  Anyway, I'll likely be back because I love the tacos so much.  But my girlfriend has mentioned that she won't ever come back, solely because of the NoWait fiasco.  And I will definitely be hesitant to suggest it to friends until the problem is addressed.",

She kept saying she would \"give us another minute\" when we didn't need one. I get it though, she seemed busy. One thing is they seem to take your order on a cell phone....fine but doesn't seem necessary to me. At first I was annoyed because I thought she was texting while taking our order.   The chips and queso were amazing and reasonably priced for the HUGE portion. We took about half home and it was still tasty the next day. I had the burnt ends taco at our waitress's recommendation and it was delicious and a good size. I also had the mac and cheese which was very tasty but did not blow my mind like I thought it might from some of these reviews.   BF had the special of the day which was a chili with the burnt ends. Tasty but VERY spicy.....he's a wimp though when it comes to heat.   Cash only poilcy is midly annoying and the vibe is a little too hipster for my taste but overall a good meal. 2 beers, an appetizer and two meals with plenty of food came to $45 before tip.",

You know they must smoke the meat when you walk in, it has the smoked flavor in the air.

The tacos were quoted 30 minutes and took 31; it's not Taco Bell..  1) Chicken apple - borders on chicken Waldorf, refreshing!. Boosted by salty bacon and light heat. Juicy chicken is slightly pink.. Excellent! Candidate for a top 5 taco!  2) Wagyu brisket - lightly dry but nice char, peppery spicing. Acid in good doses from the peppers and spiciest of the three. Very solid.  3) Pork - dull flour tortilla. Subtle spice in salsa, onions add tang, but overall bland. Pork is the highlight but too dry. The worst of the three, will skip next time.",

    "text": "Tough to give a 1-5 star rating of this place. Lots of pros and cons. I suppose it depends what you want in a restaurant... For me, more cons than pros.  Pros: burnt ends and brisket were excellent.   BBQ beans (for me) and mac were pretty good.  Cons: not cheap for what it was. Really loud. Won't be back with my family again because my mom and in-laws spent the entire time (literally) yelling at each other/leaning across the table to hear. Maybe that's on us for going at 6pm?   Not much seating.   My mom didn't enjoy the beans because they were much too spicy... And We don't remember them being labeled as such. Too bad, she ordered them as her entree.  What started me off on the wrong foot was our waitress. She seemed like she was phoning it in. In a place that loud, you really should learn to project with your voice. If older folks are asking you to repeat yourself, raise your voice when you reply, don't just simply restate at your original volume. I had to repeat the specials to my table. I'm 32, and they're mostly mid 60s. Then I asked what the house BBQ sauce was,  and she told me that it was a \"traditional BBQ sauce.\" Does that mean vinegar base or tomato base? Memphis or Carolina? Spicy? Anything would help. I asked for a clarification and didn't get any help... So I figured that she either didn't know what was in it or hasn't had enough BBQ anywhere else to know the difference. I chose the coffee sauce. Across the able we had 3 different selections, none of which really thrilled anyone. The burnt ends were great, but were not enhanced by any of the  lightly flavored/thin sauces.  Brisket portions were small.  Odd experience. I guess if you're a real BBQ fan, stick to your hole in the wall/smoke truck restaurants. They'll be cheaper and more suiting to your tastes I would bet.  If you want a pricier, trendy restaurant experience, perhaps this is the place for you.   We left as soon as the bill came to get coffee where we could hear each other. I won't be back, there's better BBQ to be had at cheaper prices.",

Despite these apparently common issues at this spot, the food and drinks were delicious. I had a fairly decent margarita. Our party ordered several different tacos, sides, Mac n cheese and the chorizo stuffed avocado...no complaints about any of the food! The queso is some of the best I've had and served with fresh soft chips. The burnt ends and brisket tacos were our top pics along with the mac n cheese! $5+/taco was a bit much but considering the sides are enough for at least 2 people, you could still get a meal for $10- $15/person + drinks.",

    "text": "\"They tricked us with their cool vibes.\" - my wife  Yes they did. The reviews are great, the atmosphere was really cool, but the food was just way too salty. I ate less than half of what I ordered, drank an entire pitcher of water, and regretted going here afterwards.  We got the queso - looked great when it came out, but the chips were over the top deep fried oily and salty.  Next we split 2 tacos (Egg Taco and the Chicken Apple Taco). The egg taco was just too much. Maybe if I was really really hungry it would have filled me up, but tonight it was just overpowering my taste buds and stomach. The Chicken Apple Taco was better, and actually probably would have been good if I already didn't feel sick from everything else.  Oh yeah I forgot to mention we split a side of Mac.  Again, just way too salty.  Also they don't have any soda products. That's kinda a bummer for me since I really do enjoy a good soda with my tacos.   I can see how this place gets good reviews, I think maybe we just weren't in the mood for such a heavy and salty dinner.",

Their juice of the day and homemade soda was horrible. I believe they got too caught up in being trendy & \"cool\" that they forgot the food has to be good. The waitress whose name I can't remember was very pleasant and did her best to accommodate date us.. I would maybe go back on a night when I can actually get bbq from a bbq joint instead we had to order disappointing burgers",

    "text": "Great place! I did not deduct any stars for the 35 minute wait, because the place is making such great food, it's only natural that people are flocking here!  We came here with the kids, and were pleasantly surprised to see a decent kids' meal - a rarity these days. Yes, I had the usual Mac n' cheese and potato bite options, but it was several steps up from a chain restaurant kids' menu flavor wise. Our kids loved the broccolini and corn, as well as the Mac and cheese.  For us, we got the salad (no meat added on), which currently is a tasty mix of greens, house made potato bites (we ARE in Pittsburgh, after all!!!), cherry tomatoes, and a bleu cheese dressing. We decided to go for 4 total tacos, which is crazy, unless you are a college kid. One taco is enough to be an adult's main course - they are not skimpy. We chose the pulled pork, chicken, brisket, and chorizo. We had originally wanted the rib taco, but it was later in the afternoon, and they were out.  My favorite was the pulled pork, followed by the brisket, then the chicken, and finally the chorizo, although all four were ridiculously flavorful and the meat was well smoked. I do wish that they would turn down the spice just a little bit on the brisket and chicken tacos in order to let the meat do the talking, but the spice wasn't overwhelming.  All of the staff we interacted with were super friendly, and the food comes out quite fast for a full restaurant - sounds like they've worked on this from some of the earlier reviews. It's BYOB, and there's a beer shop next door and a wine store across the street. The iced tea and lemonade were superb, since we didn't feel like partaking in wine or beer at the time.  When we were done, we asked them to box up the leftovers (totally miscalculated - one taco per person is quite filling if you're eating a side dish or salad, and aren't a college kid...) and it was done quickly and efficiently. It's a cash only establishment, so estimate before you go and stop at one of the banks that are literally next door - or you can use the ATM in the back.  Overall, it's a great place with great food - well worth any wait you may have. I'm very pleased that it lived up to all of the hype I've read for the past two years! We will definitely be back!!!",

The side dishes here are some of my favorite things -- try the queso which comes with delicious homemade soft tortilla chips, or the brocollini and corn which is my hands-down favorite! I tried the pulled pork sandwich for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and it was delicious on a home made soft brioche bun. If you're in the mood for tacos, try the migas, chicken apple, or pork. They now have a full bar -- wine, beer, and cocktails.  Note that they are only open for lunch on Fridays currently.  I wish it was a little quieter inside sometimes as it makes it difficult to carry on a conversation, but love the place otherwise.",

Service was great - we were sat at a table promptly, waitress was attentive and not intrusive, kept drinks topped up without having to be called etc. The decorations and overall atmosphere of the place was great too, albeit the music was a little loud for dinner time. This part was really exceptional.  Now - the food. It was disappointing. We both ordered BBQ plates with which consisted of brisket, burnt ends, and pulled chicken, and sides of BBQ beans and Brocolini and Corn. At a place which has \"Smoke BBQ\" in the name I expected at least mediocre BBQ - but this place failed to deliver. Dry, lack of flavor, and lack of seasoning (mainly salt) all around.There was more smoke smell and flavor in the room than there was in the meats.   I may have to return to eat some of the tacos, though only due to the great service and ambience at the place.  There is so much potential in this place, if they could just improve the food!!",

While the macaroni and cheese is delicious, the tacos I tried (pork and veggie) were dry and relatively flavorless. I don't understand why they are delivered to the table wrapped in aluminum foil, it's weird and downmarket. I also HATE (sorry) the strange, prison-style slop trays that you're expected to put your side dishes onto. The server seemed taken aback that we would want actual plates rather than a 9\" x 12\" tin shingle to eat from. Visited in early April and the space was freezing. Room for improvement indeed.

    "text": "I'm always glad to have another dining option within a couple blocks of my house, so I was happy when Smoke made the move to Butler Street. It was good, but I think I may have been a liiiiittle let down after hearing all of the hype ever since it opened.  They did a great job with the space. It's very warm and cozy, with tons of wood and industrial finishes. It fits right in along Rowhouse/Atlas Bottle Works/etc.  My friend and I started with the queso, which had a great flavor with smoked poblanos and onions. It's served with fresh flour tortilla chips, of which my friend and I had quite different opinions. I enjoyed the salty, puffy chips, while she felt they were far too greasy and had trouble eating more than a few. I didn't mind this and actually took the remaining chips/queso home. The leftovers held up well on the second day.  I tried two tacos: the ribs and the chicken. The ribs came with pickles, onions, and barbecue sauce. I wasn't blown away by the meat--it was good, but didn't really stand out from similar tacos I have had in the past. $6.25 for a single, normal-sized taco feels a little steep if it doesn't completely blow you away. The chicken was topped with pickled onions, hot sauce, and an avocado cream. I liked the combination of the spicy sauce with the creamy avocado, but again, it was pretty average.  I hate to complain about this, but the cash-only thing... I understand it as a cost-saving measure, maybe in the case of a really tiny operation trying to reduce overhead, etc. But this is a full service restaurant in 2016, and while the items on the menu aren't terribly expensive individually, you will spend just as much here on a full meal as most any other comparable restaurant. It's not the end of the world by any means (and, if you forget to plan ahead, there is a PNC literally 100 feet away), but just an annoyance.",

They just reopened in Lawrenceville & the new place is beautiful. So much more seating available. Everything I've eaten @ Smoke has been delicious. The Queso & chips & the Mac n cheese are definite appetizers. I always order the egg & veggie tacos both with avocado cream. Amazing! This past time I went I tried the Brisket taco & it was so good! Honestly I was a little leery to try the brisket b/c I had just been to Austin TX & tried brisket for the first time (which Texas is known for their smoked brisket). However I must say Smoke did a damn good job making their brisket. Not quite as good as Texas but its still really good!!  Service is always great, everybody is so friendly. The only downside is once you place your order it takes a long time to get your tacos. But it's totally worth the wait! Highly recommend!!!",

    "text": "We came in for a friend's birthday and we were seated promptly ( we had reservations ). I've hear a lot about this place so I was eager to try it.   Our waiter was really nice and patient. We had a rather large party and two people were running late. Not once did our waiter loose patience with us. He was very up beat and nice even when asked to take a photo of a group of 8 girls while he was busy. He kindly took our pictures and had fun with it.   The ambience is very trendy, very fun. It was a type of rustic hipster, if you will. It's byob, but there is a 6 pack store right next door.  Unfortunately, to me, the food was just okay. I got the ribs taco, which was good, but nothing really special, just rib meat, onions, and cilantro in a soft taco shell. I also got the chicken apple taco. It was supposed to have apple, bacon, cheese,and a jalapeno mayo in it. I'm a huge fan of sweet and savory / sweet and spivey, but the spiciness overpowered the whole taco. (I can tolerate a pretty high level of spiciness but this was a little much) I could only taste chicken and mayo. The apple coleslaw was good, but again, not mind blowing, just a regular vinegar based coleslaw with apple in it. I did try my friend's chorizo macaroni and cheese; THAT, was fantastic. I would say best thing on the menu. The chorizo was well done, great flavor and paired with that Mac n cheese...absolutely phenomenal.   I read in a few reviews and was told the service was slow. I actually feel like for a small, locally ran restaurant they were fairly decent. Yes, it took a little longer than your average chain, but they have a very small kitchen, try to give you a higher end experience with their food, and have take out orders. Therefore, I think the service was fine and nothing out of the ordinary.   As far as pricing goes, it's a little on the higher end for what you get. I don't mind paying more for a great food experience; however, I definitely didn't think my chicken taco was worth what I paid for it (6.00).  The chorizo Mac n cheese was worth what we paid though. Although, I do understand given the neighborhood they are housed in.   It was my first visit there so I'm definitely not opposed to going again and trying something else. Perhaps, it may even sway my yelp rating for this restaurant. I really enjoy the vibe.  It seems like a good spot to hang out and get some small bites throughout the night.     Definitely worth a try.",

I love Cure/Morcilla, Vandal, Smallman Galley etc, but in a vacuum, the Smoke Rib Taco is my choice (I always get 3, and then eat salad the next day).  There's usually a wait, but you can always do takeout.  Or you can do your best senior citizen impression and go early and secure a seat (the bar is fine too).  Difficult to accompany large parties, go with a loved one or random stranger you met on Tinder.  IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND:  Procol Harum.

Hubs and I ordered the shroom queso and chips to share. I asked whether we should pay the $3 premium for the shroom version vs. regular. Hubs was intrigued by the smoked mushrooms, so we did that. When it arrived, he acknowledged my question was too True. There was hardly any mushrooms and the queso was liquid like. As for the chips, was that pita or tortilla? Oh, no.  I was wise and ordered only one taco--brunt ends. Hubs ordered the brisket and chorizo. Neither of us ate more than half of our tacos. Brunt ends was too salty. I was eating pita/tortilla as a palate cleanser...need I say more. The chorizo was okay, average at best. The brisket was fine, bit dry.  So, two beers, three tacos, and chips and queso was a $60 (which includes tip) dinner. Nah, no, I'm fine without. Service was at least attentive.",

If you haven't been there, the name of the restaurant doesn't really stand out on the door, so just look close. We got a good laugh.   We started with the original chips and queso. So good! I'm actually still craving those homemade flour tortilla chips right now! It comes with a bunch, so we had some to take home too. We also got their Monday drink special, which was $5 sex on the beach. Good deal!  We each got 2 tacos and it was more than enough. I only ate half of each and took the rest home. I was honestly a little disappointed in the tacos. Smoke has been on my list of places to go for a while. I got a pork taco and it was better than average, but kinda dried out. I also got their special taco of the day which was fried chicken and grilled chicken together with a bunch of other stuff. That one was better than the pork, but nothing amazing.  If I go back again, I'll for sure get the chips and queso again and maybe I'll try one of the beef tacos.",

Second is you'll practically walk right by this place if you aren't careful. The door looks like but I promise, chances are they are open.   This is the tacos are large. I ordered the chorizo taco. Incredible. They have special tacos on the menu and the staff is so knowledgeable they'll be happy to make a recommendation. The tacos are also prepared rather quickly so it's no problem to try a flavor and the order and additional taco if needed. Be sure to try the Mac and cheese and other side dishes as they are also amazing.  To drink I had the Aperol Sprits. Very light and summery. Great choice with a taco.   If you love a good taco be sure not to miss this spot.",

Dark natural wood is the primary adornment along with Edison style lightbulbs. I sat at the bar in the early afternoon and despite the later lunch hour, there were still quite a few people. I ordered two different tacos (house-made soft tortillas) and they came on a tray surrounded in aluminum foil.   The meat was juicy and full of flavor. You could tell you were eating BBQ, which I usually prefer unadorned, but the combinations brought everything together.  All that said, my two tacos ran about $7 each and they are not that big. Tasty stuff, but if you are looking for quantity over taste, go to Chipotle.",

Queso is amazing, but also always costs at least $13 if not $15-18. Vegetarian tacos have been either really good or just \"meh.\" I've never been as disappointed with a breakfast taco as I have been with Smoke. And again, it's not cheap. It's not like it's a $3 taco that was only okay.  Service is usually very efficient and the place appears to be very clean.  Overall, I don't really prefer Smoke over many restaurants, but it's not bad. I also have not had any entrees with actual meat in it so that could affect my perception as well.",

However, we were able to go on a Thursday night a couple weeks ago. We got there around 6pm. The hostess said the wait time would be able 30 minutes - we put in our name and walked down to Wildcard to waste time. Our wait time only ended up being about 10 minutes, so we headed back to the restaurant.   We got seated at a small table - but it was spacious enough for the two of us. We ordered the Thursday drink special 'Negronis' for $5. To be honest - they were too strong and not good. I definitely won't order them again.   To start, we ordered the House Queso - it was delicious! We had to mix it up though - but the flavors were amazing together. Their chips are to die for!   For my entree, I ordered 2 tacos and we ordered the Mac n cheese to share. The Mac n cheese is amazing- it's very good. I ordered the chicken & apple taco - it was a great burst of flavors! It was so good. However, I hated the pulled pork taco I ordered- it had no flavor at all. I didn't even finish it.   Overall- Smoke has a great atmosphere and the food is very good!",

My bartender/server was very friendly and helpful. CONS Cash only in 2018 is not very consumer friendly though they do have an ATM on the premises. Tip: if you bank with Citizens then cross the street to avoid this establishment's 2.50 ATM fee. It took me three tries to order a drink for which they carried all the ingredients. I began with a diet coke. No luck. They do not carry name soft drinks, much less diet. My server explained they make everything in house so they do have cola and ginger ale but it is made there and they opted not to make diet drinks as they were not that popular with their diners.  Fine. I tried to then order a mojito. Again, no luck as they do not have mint. OKAY... I settled for Maker's Mark and ginger ale, their version...result?? they should scrap the homemade nonsense for it ruint my Maker's Mark...  The tacos were tasty but way too big to try several. Note their shells were homemade, too.  Honestly, I would not have known the difference except being told. My honest opinion? Ok but Condados is just about a block away...with competition they better rethink the consumer experience.",

The chef just tosses together whatever ingredients he wants. One of ours was a smoked pulled chicken with bbq and crispy onion straws. The other was a ground beef I think with roasted corn.

These are quite the gourmet taco creations.   I had the veg and the BLT with chicken added! The BLT with chicken was my favorite of the two, but there's others that I'd love to go back and try. Unfortunately, the queso can't be made gluten free so beware of that if you are like me!  Everything I tasted had quite a kick to it. I love spice, but I know some in my party where surprised by the level of spice.  The decor is adorable, and it smells like a True smokehouse when you walk in there. The bar stools could be a bit more comfortable at some of the high tops, but it likely helps a with table turnover. I'd recommend, and will update once I try more tacos!",

Being a Thursday night, there was a bit of a wait but they'll take your number down and text you when your table is ready. Giving you plenty of time to explore Lawrenceville or grab a drink at another bar while you wait. Unfortunately, there isn't a lot of space at their bar to wait for your table.   The restaurant is kind of tucked away next to the movie theater and doesn't have a big flashy sign to let you know you've made it. This gives it that \"hidden gem\" feel once you've discovered it.   When you step inside, the aroma of smoked meats immediately makes your mouth drool. The vibe inside is industrial and trendy. There aren't a lot of tables, which would explain the longer wait. If you aren't in any rush, it's worth the extra time.   The house margarita and old fashioned were both good drink choices. The margaritas are a good balance of tangy and sweet and the old fashioned was tasty as well. While the menu is relatively small, nearly all of the options looked appetizing. The tacos are relatively large portions, two, maybe three would be enough for a meal and the salads are HUGE. Both the tacos and salad were delicious.   The service was great. While they are busy, it didn't seem as though they were understaffed or anything and our food came out relatively quick.   If you ever find yourself wandering this side of town, hungry, definitely give Smoke a try. You won't regret it!",

    "text": "Not a big fan of this place. Only went because my cousin really wanted to try it. What drew us to this restaurant was that they had \"wagyu beef\" tacos. We ordered the brisket, and honestly it just tasted like ordinary brisket meat, nothing like wagyu. The tacos were pretty spicy in my opinion, it had lots of peppers, and not as flavorful as I expected. We also tried the queso and chips dip. I think it's flour tortillas deep fried. It was good, but the cheese was too watery. I wish it hard more of a cheesy texture to it. My cousin got the chicken taco and said it was good, but it was very spicy as well. My brother said the pork ribs were too salty, and picked off the crust to enjoy it. The brocollini and corn was very interesting. It was good and the corn was really sweet, just how I like it. I got a watermelon agua fresca and it did not taste like fresh watermelon juice with pulp. It was okay, probably just made from syrup or something.   Service was good, our waitress was nice and checked on us occasionally.   What mostly irritated me was that it took a while for the food to come. I understand that we were a larger party of 7, but we were fine with the food coming out as it was ready. They bring the food by seats I guess. A party that came a while after us and order way after us received their food before us. Not sure what the logic is, but okay.  Verdict: Spicy average tacos that are overly priced. Wouldn't recommend or come back.",

    "text": "I've gone to Smoke two times now and have a hard time getting over the sticker shock of the menu. The chips made in house are to die for, but everything else is just ok.   The queso is around $14 and while it is a large serving they do not give you enough chips to finish it with. I asked for extra and the waiter kindly brought my more, but then tacked on an additional $3.50 charge for the extra chips. By the end of it my \"appetizer\" queso was $17.50 which is more than I typically spend on an entree at any other restaurant.   I was trying to decide what kind of tacos I wanted for dinner when I noticed that many of them were priced around $8. I asked the waiter how many tacos came with it when he let me know that it was only one. One taco for $8??? That seems a tad extreme.   By the end of it we decided to stick with queso and one drink each and our bill was near $40. They now accept credit cards, but make you pay the 3.5% transaction fee. I mean come on.... 3.5% is not much, but you're already charging $14 for queso and $8 a taco. When businesses only accept cash or have you pay the credit card fees, that is a big turn off for me. It's 2019, get with it Smoke.",

    "text": "So good news or bad news first. Let's start bad news.   First, the lack of signage. If I hadn't read reviews on yelp before meeting friends for dinner, we might not have found this place. My friends think they are trying to fit the hipster mentality and remain anonymous. I personally hate this. A sign with their name or even the address on the door would be really helpful. Second, they are cash only. Not a big deal since they have an ATM in the back of the restaurant near the restrooms. Third, it's BYOB and we had no idea. Didn't notice this bit of information in any comments or reviews we read online. Luckily atlas bottle works is next door and offers chilled bottles and growlers to go.   Now for the good news- the food! So good. We started with chips and queso. There was enough for four of us to share. I am a huge fan of homemade chips and these were spot on.   We also ordered biscuits and Mac and cheese as sides. I wasn't a huge fan of the biscuits; a little to greasy for me. Now the Mac and cheese, that was a different story. Yummy! My husband didn't love it because the cheese they used was a little to sharp for his taste.  The tacos were excellent. We asked the waiter how big they were and he recommended two per person. I would say this is too much food if you are ordering sides. My rib taco was overstuffed but delicious. The chicken and Apple was also excellent but the star of the show was the brisket.   We look forward to our next meal at smoke.",

We decided to sit at the bar and bypass a 30+ minute wait.  I ordered the brisket taco and pork taco.  The meat in the tacos was dry and overwhelming with sauce, it poured out on the tray while eating them.  The mac and cheese side was bland and lacked salt.    Maybe we just hit this place on a bad night.  I will go back again to make sure, but this trip was disappointing.",

The atmosphere here is Lawrencville trendy- you know what I mean - exposed brick walls, dim lighting, and contemporary art.  But it works and it sets the stage for a nice meal.    Fairly simple menu with several types of tacos.  I got the BLT taco with a nice and spicy jalapeno mayo that had a great kick.  I also ordered the Mac and it was very tasty and rich- I took half home and was equally full both sittings.    The service is good here.  I find it amusing that the restaurant has a large bar, but it's BYOB.  I'm assuming they have a lot of mixers.  I saw several lemonade and non-alcoholic options.  There's also a mini fridge you can put your beer in to keep cool.    I plan on being a repeat costumer.",

I will start with the bad and with only one bad thing I will keep it short. It took a little time to get someone to greet me and put my small group in the system for seating. That was about it. After that we were seated fast and orders taken. Also I feel since it's a new place everyone is still trying to find the flow of it and they are all doing a great job but just need to get the rhythm down.  They don't serve alcohol but the beer store is right next to it and for a small fee of $1.75 a person you can do BYOB.  They have a small menu but everything has big flavor. I mean the brisket Mac n cheese was awesome! Every taco we got was amazing. The tacos are personal size but the sides easily feed 2 to 3 people with extra. We all just got the tacos we wanted and split the sides. The bill was not bad at all and everything was very good. I would go back and you should try it.",

    "text": "I've heard SUCH good things about Smoke, so it's been on my list for a while to visit. Needless to say I was less than impressed with the place.   Previously, Smoke was on the NoWait App which is awesome. It's a great app and makes the waiting far better than just going in and putting your name in. Well, Smoke doesn't offer NoWait anymore. So I drove down and put my name in, well little did I know that they DO still have call-ahead. So while there wasn't that many people in the restaurant it was still an hour minimum wait. When I asked if we can grab drinks at the bar, I was also told that they seat at the bar so that was out of the question as well. To say it was annoying is being polite. I put my name in, and went next door to grab drinks.   Over an hour later, I still did not get any text that the table was ready. So we went back to the hostess that said there was 5 more people ahead of me, AFTER AN HOUR. But that they could seat us at the bar... which while on a date, was the whole reason why we waited over an hour for a table.   Once we did get seated, at the bar, the bartender was great. After you get seated, service is pretty great. The ambiance is very industrial but very chic. I was impressed with both.   Now the food. I ordered the queso and chips and the apple chicken taco. The queso was delicious but the taco left a lot to be desired. To begin with, it was SO spicy. Like had to drink a few gulps of water after each bite spicy. While I do enjoy a good kick, I just couldn't finish the taco.   I feel like Smoke has a great potential to be a good restaurant, but first impressions do leave a lot to be desired at this place.",

    "text": "If the review were based solely on food I would give them 4 starts. I can't give them more than 3 stars based on overall experience.  My boyfriend and I had called around 4:30pm on a Sunday to make a reservation for 5:30pm. The host told us there was no wait and we shouldn't need a reservation for that time but he will put us down. We showed up at 5:10pm. The host said we may have to wait 15 minutes. Was a bit odd given that not long before he told us no wait and reservation wasn't necessary. 5:30 rolls around and didn't seem like it was any closer to us being seated. At 5:40 he tells us shouldn't be too much longer since people are getting ready to leave. He then updates us they are clearing the table... then we wait for 10 more minutes. When I asked him why he said they were waiting for forks to be cleaned. Its quite surprising that a restaurant can run out of forks during a time that is apparently not considered busy. Finally at 6pm we were seated.   We went back the following night (Monday) as a friend wanted to try the place. We called just after 6. They put our name on wait list and said would be about an hour, but may be a bit sooner. One hour later we showed up and figured we'd be seated asap. Nope. We waited 40 minutes more.  I understand they can't rush people out who are eating or socializing. But, they do need a different policy for reservations. If their estimated time has so much discrepancy from reality they should refrain from giving estimates or taking reservations as both prove pointless.  The food was good. Between the two nights we tried several tacos. All but the pork one were good. The mac and cheese is good.   The service was fine.  They do need to install a heater by the front door. The cold air comes in and regardless of how far back you are sitting it is quite cold.   Since the food is good, but the wait times are terrible, and service isn't anything spectacular take out may be the way to go.",

    "text": "If I could give this place negative stars I would. I am going to hash this out while it is still fresh and steaming. Steaming like the pile of crap that is Smoke. My family decided to patron this dumpster fest. We were a party of 15 that came in around 5pm, we spent over $500 over the course of 2 hours. Let's begin. We walked in to smoke staggard, the hostess refused to seat us at our reserved table because she couldn't see the whole party. The hostess was rude and disenchanting. When we finnaly sat down, we had to wait an excruciating amount of time for any service. When we did, in short, it was crap. After we ordered, we also had to wait another distasteful amount of time for the food to come. For how short their menu is you would think that they could push some food out within a reasonable amount of time. The food, while not terrible was mediocre at best. Around the time we were finishing up the hostess walks by and gives us a dirty look for reasons still unknown. We make our complaints known to the owner who seems understanding. After which customers who are now waiting in the lobby begin harassing our whole party for the purpose of removing us from our table. There was absolutely no tact involved. Why would this be related to the Establishment? They cited the owner who was standing right behind them. They mentioned things like \"we know the owner\" \"the owner wants you out\" \"you all should be ashamed of yourselves\" intermingled with personal attacks at individual members of my family who up until this point had no interaction with the morons. All in all we get up to leave after 10 or so minutes when the owner doesn't say anything and they continue. This continues until the moment we all left. Needless to say, we will not come back. The food and service alone were horrifying. And the treatment we were allowed in the presence of the owner by the owners friends sealed the deal. May their Establishment be condemned according to their own actions. ~V",

My friend had the triple peppered Margarita which was also very good with a little kick at the end. We decided to split both the queso and the mac and cheese. The queso is a big serving probably good enough for 5 people. The chips were crispy homemade pita chips that came out warm. The queso was extremely good. Hard to stop myself from eating all of it. The mac and cheese was also delicious. Perfect amount of crunch, cheese, and smokiness. I also ordered the brisket taco. It was out of this world! The BBQ was extremely good. Very simple taco but made to perfection. If you come hungry I would recommend ordering two.   Overall amazing food! Keep in mind it's cash only!",

BYOB is a plus, but don't forget it's cash only. I would recommend any of the tacos, they are all great. Also, we ordered the queso and chips. Absolutely amazing. Soft fried pita chips are so good. Eat it!",

    "text": "I can see why Smoke may not be suited for everyone, but this local spot has quickly turned into a fan favorite for my wife and me. What we love about Smoke is their gluten free menu and happy hour drink specials. A great house margarita for $5? How can you beat that?  The most impressive part of Smoke is definitely the homemade gluten free tortillas. These monsters hold up to all of the amazing fillings featured on their gluten free menu (only minor alterations from the regular menu). Rather than wimpy single corn tortillas (always a disaster) or double tortillas (classic, but expected), Smoke has made gluten free tortillas that are soft, chewy, and hearty enough to handle all the fillings. Now the fillings are a feat in and of themselves. These aren't your traditional fillings--they've put their own spin on some classics and bring their own unique tacos to the table. My favorites are the Chicken Apple and Migas tacos, while my wife loves the BLT tacos (with and without added chicken). That's the other thing--two tacos are plenty to fill you up. As I said, these aren't wimpy tacos! Quality over quantity reigns supreme at Smoke, where you will get tacos stuffed full of flavorful and satisfying fillings.  As I said, this is a Happy Hour favorite for my wife and I, and we frequently run down on a Thursday or Friday to catch the tail end of the $5 margaritas. The bar staff is helpful and friendly, and you'll leave satisfied and feeling just the right level of buzzed off of tacos and tequila. We will definitely be returning soon!",

    "text": "Writing this review makes me want to go back to Smoke BBQ all over again. Came here on a Sunday with a group of 4. There was a wait list but it took only about 10 minutes to get seated. For starters, we order the house queso. Their chips seem to be a spin off of pita chips baked in house, which are delicious and really upgrade the queso. Highly recommend getting one of their queso dips for starters. The house queso came with avocado and chicken and Fresno hot sauce, it was a bit on the spicy side so watch out before getting this one.   For main course we ordered the brisket and ribs. Highly recommend both of these dishes. The ribs come as one size and the platter cost $22. The brisket legs you choose from 1/4 up to 1lb. We opted for the 1/2lb. We also got Mac and cheese and potato salad. Everything was excellent and cooked to perfection. Portion sizes are very large so expect to be stuffed leaving this meal.   Let's not forget to mention their drinks. They have a variety of drinks including a great selection of margaritas.   Note, they do accept card but they charge a 3% fee so I'd recommend bringing cash to avoid any excess fee.",

It seems like I was invited to someones house to watch them hang out with their friends and they will occasionally stop by and ask if you are okay.   I wasn't treated poorly but the staff was incredibly slow and would often hang out together at various points (mostly at the bar) to chit chat. As someone who has worked in the industry what I've experienced here seemed a bit excessive. Hopefully I was just there at a couple bad times.",

There's a good selection of local beers, including Roundabout, Hitchhiker and Eleventh Hour most recently. It's nicely curated - not all IPAs. We ordered house made tortilla chips with queso for our table of four (we can't do this for the two of us if we want to be able to eat dinner). Anyway, we all thought it was delicious. Another favorite is the broccolini and corn side dish - everyone we take there loves it. This time, I chose to order a second helping as my entree with smoked brisket added, and it was excellent. Others around the table ordered tacos and were very happy.   We arrived for a late lunch on a Saturday and sat right down. If you want to go in the evening, especially on a weekend, be prepared for a wait of an hour. Sometimes rather than wait on a busy night we find seats at the bar, and we like that just as much.",

    "text": "Mixed review! Keep in mind I went to a BBQ Taqueria as a vegetarian.  When you arrive at Smoke, the first thing you notice is clearly the smell of the BBQ - it's awesome. The entry way is lined with freshly cut wood, that they use to smoke all of their meats. The space itself is quaint (not very large)  On Cinco De Mayo we stopped in and I was surprised that there wasn't a longer wait. For two people, we were put on a wait list for about 35 minutes (not bad for a Sunday, especially Cinco De Mayo)  I loved that there were several vegetarian options. I tried the avocado taco, and the mushroom taco. Whatever the mushrooms were seasoned with made the taco taste amazing! The only thing that I was disappointed in, I wish that I had asked if they had a hard shell taco (those are my favorite)  There were several daily specials, we tried to order one but something had happened in the kitchen and they ran out. The brunch specials sounded amazing though (not vegetarian)   Drinks were just OK, different margaritas $10 very distinguished ingredients - grapefruit, \"spicy\", blood orange, etc. My second drink was wine (there were only three wine options on the menu) and came in a tiny glass (not even a wine glass)  My favorite part was probably the mushroom queso dip. I don't usually eat cheese so this was a treat for me - I have to say that the tortillas that were served with the queso made the whole dish!  All in all, I'm happy we stopped here. The atmosphere was nice and relaxing - and the food was fresh. I do agree with other reviews that prices are a bit steep. That was my deciding factor between 3, and 4 stars.   Side Note: Two homemade hot sauces on the table \"Hot, and Hot AF\" Clearly I went with the Hot AF - which was quite possibly my favorite part of the meal! Super hot, very good!",

I feel like they've either sold their business, or just gotten super lazy when it comes to customer care. They've added the ability to pay with a credit card now, but with a 3.5% fee. I'll just keep paying cash, if I go back now.   Matt and I entered around 5 for dinner. The hostess did not greet us, just took us to a table (that's now closer to the table next to you even more than before) for two. We could have been meeting someone else or have a larger party, why just assume? I digress.   With the rise in \"popularity\" of Lawrenceville, so have the prices at smoke increase drastically over the years. $14 for queso, really? That's silly.   The waiter was attentive enough, but I found myself never having water. I get it, it's free, don't complain, but this is the first time I've ever run into the issue of not having water here. Again, I digress.   I really hope this was either a fluke. I hope it's not regular practice there now that they kinda just don't care anymore.",

There is a PNC ATM next door and a private ATM in the back if you forget cash.   The inside is very hip, modern and service is always efficient. There is a variety of craft beer and cocktails, but the best cocktail is the Loretta. The Loretta is made with gin but has a honey, lemon, lavender taste and is very delicious. There are dips and quesos offered as appetizers and they are delicious but very rich so I would recommend ordering one less taco than you would plan to if you're sharing the queso. The chips are house made as a giant cut-up flour tortilla and are amazing. The initial bite or two of the house queso may seem spicy, but once the hot sauce mixes in it's quite mild.   Tacos are generously sized but a bit expensive ($7+) as you order per taco. There is a variety of beef, pork, chicken and veggie tacos so there are plenty of options. The burnt ends are very smokey and delicious. I would recommend asking if there are any specials. Each time I've been to Smoke, there has been a type of fried chicken taco special and they have been my favorite. I love flour tortillas and all tacos are served in the house made tortillas.",

Only complaint would be that it took ~30-40mins for the order to be ready after I placed it on Yelp - that being said, it was worth the wait and did come out on time/as scheduled on the app. I walked in, picked up the order, and actually ended up eating both tacos on the way home because I couldn't wait!   If you're stopping in to grab takeout, or sitting down to eat, you can park on the street and pay, or there's a little lot down the street on the side opposite the taqueria (max 2 hours, limited spots). Place is also slightly hard to find (not great signage) - really had to search for it on google maps based on landmarks around it! Super cute interior decor/vibe, though, once you find it.  I got the brisket taco with avocado and cheese added, and a pork carnitas taco. Both were excellent, and not overpacked to the point where you bite in and it spills out everywhere. Would have taken a picture, but like I said - I was so hungry I devoured them on my way home! Slightly expensive for a quick bite to eat (~$10 per taco once you add cheese), but would be back for sure!",

We were greeted with a smile by our waitress and there was a nice crowd of all ages dining. We ordered brunch because dinner isn't available until 5. We ordered Chicken & Waffles and Biscuits smothered with gravy & eggs. The Chix & Waffles were delicous. The Biscuits and gravy were bland and the taste of flour in the gravy was unpleasant, but overall the service was good, the food was good and we will be back for dinner. We can't wait to taste the ribs and side dishes! Definitely a great place to visit when the weather gets warm.",

I'd heard much about it so I suggested that we stop by when we were looking for a place to grab a quick drink and snack.  First of all, I love the decor. It's extremely unique and very Instagrammable. It was a pretty packed house and for a while it seemed the bartender was tending to the entire place and not just the bar. I had the Aperol Spritz and my bf had the Berry Melon Margarita. I loooooved the Spritz. It was a perfect ratio of the ingredients, in a nice sized glass, with not too much ice. My bf found the margarita to be fantastic.   Sadly they were out of the burnt end queso that we wanted to try but instead we got a small order of the pulled pork to share which was perfect size for what we were looking. Definitely an idea for a $4 app. Big intentions on coming back to dine!",

Walking in, you smell and see the wood that they use to well, smoke, their meats and smack dab in the middle of the restaurant you'll see the smoker. Great stuff.  Brisket taco- 3.8/5 Wish it were better. It has a good flavor profile with all of the ingredients complimenting each other, but the brisket just wasn't that good. With the meat being the backbone of any dish, and with the emphasis that they put on their meats, I just wasn't impressed. It was on the drier side and didn't have the standalone flavor I was looking for.  Queso- 3.8/5 (queso) 4.1/5 (chips)  The queso was of the thin variety. The peppers made it pop but otherwise was unremarkable. The chips are house-cut and fried flour tortillas.   Value- 3.3 Look- if you want good tacos, feel free to stop by here. If you want great tacos, just head south, I still haven't found any in Pittsburgh. The queso ($11) was a shareable amount and probably worth the buck to split. The taco ($7.50, lol) was grossly undersized and overpriced by a few bucks for the taste. Luckily I didn't make the mistake of getting two. Would I be back? Wouldn't go out of my way but I'd give it another shot (if it was pay day).",

Once Smoke announced they were (re?) opening, many friends suggested that it would be an exciting place to satisfy my cravings.  It wasn't.  Smoke is more of a BBQ joint than it is a taco joint. Think Union Pig & Chicken. The thing is, they give you tortillas. Flour tortillas, and only flour tortillas. Oh, and you want totopos (tortilla chips)? Well, those only come in flour, too. Bleh.  Maybe I was just disappointed because everybody set my expectations incorrectly. But, even with that, the food didn't terribly impress me, and I'd rather go to UP&C for bbq comfort food cravings.",

The mac and cheese is among the best I've ever had; and, my super picky son actually tried something \"new\" and gobbled it up (BIG props to the chef for this)! We didn't get adult beverages - but the bar list wasn't lacking in options for beer and cocktails. The only drawback is that the prices are a bit expensive for lunch - so we'll probably only go back for dinner. Otherwise, I highly recommend Smoke!",

No other table was rushed out of the restaurant but us. I asked the hostess if they took reservations she said no but they have a waiting list that they try to accommodate. We were treated very poorly by the hostess and spent over $300 here. Will not be returning, which is unfortunate because our waitress was amazing!

After waiting for a taco for 90 minutes, I asked if my waiter knew when the food would come, and he angrily responded that the kitchen was small and it takes a while for food to come out.  The food is overpriced for the quality. The meat is consistently dry which is a quality they attempt to cover with sauce that is not so much a flavor but spice. The beans were akin to overturning a can of pinto beans into a bowl and adding tabasco.  When a friend told the waiter that the beans were not satisfactory in any way, the waiter argued that they were very good and that we were wrong.   It is not worth the wait or the money. Lawrenceville has several other options that are better quality with better service. There is better Mexican available all over the city. I would rather eat at Chipotle and be served in a timely manner with quality control.   However, the bathrooms are very nice. 10/10 would pee again.",

Despite this the music playing was slightly louder than we would have liked and talking across the table was a bit of a task, not unbearable but voice had to be raised. The water is served without ice which we actually agreed was a huge plus! Who would've thought!? As far as the meals are concerned I was extremely pleased with the chicken and burnt ends brisket meal. The meats were cooked perfectly and very flavorful. There are a number of side options that are unique and all appetizing. Our only gripe was the taco order only comes with one taco and the price is a bit steep for such a small servicing without being accompanied by a side. Luckily my entree came with two sides  and I am always happy to share with my lovely girl! 4/5 Definitely recommend if you are in Lawrenceville in Spring/Summer and are craving Mexican style BBQ!

I sent the email and received a reply stating we would have seats ready at 730pm.  Going back and forth updating the amount of people in our party, they confirmed us for 730 for 14 people. We arrived around 650pm, with 10 minutes to spare. The person at the front counter stated he didn't know about our reservation. And also stated the website doesn't sync with their in-shop program. We waited an extra 30 minutes to be seated. We finally were seated. The waitress started to take our drink orders and explained the menu. We received our drinks within a few minutes. We stated to order, and our waitress said, no, we are out of chicken and ribs. She was getting rude with our group. We decided to leave due to being treated terrible. After deciding on a different restaurant, we shockingly received an email  from the programs that won't communicate with each other, stating how sorry they were they didn't have our table, and they offered to comp a bottle of wine upon out return.   1. I would not recommend this place to anyone hungry.  2. The host stated we needed to come in to make our reservations instead of using THEIR website.   I am very disappointed in this business!!!!!!!

    "text": "Back when this restaurant was in it's previous location, I probably would have given it 4 stars.  We just recently went back to Pittsburgh and wanted to try this in their new location.  First thing I would have to mention is the prices seem way higher than before.  I could be wrong but I don't feel the food justifies the cost.  The burnt ends taco tasted great but it was not worth $7.  Their pork taco was not even what I remember and not that great.  The queso is not what I remember and also seems a lot more expensive.  The fact that they don't take credit cards when a meal for two can easily be over $50 is ridiculous.  Brought $40 thinking that would be enough, I was wrong.  Consistency is important and they even struggled with that in their previous location.",

    "text": "Had lunch at this establishment today.  4 tacos and a rice water drink = $42.00.  I can read the prices on the menu so the pricing didn't bother me, it's what I got for the $42.00. We received, 4 tacos of which 2 were brisket, 1 was pork and the last one was egg. We all know the barbecue is already cooked and one can scramble some eggs in about 2 mins.  With this knowledge I wondering how it can take 25 mins to make 4 tacos.  I live in San Antonio where you can get great tacos everywhere in a matter of a few mins.    While waiting for our tacos I'm thinking these should be awesome since they are taking so long and there are only 9 people in the restaurant.  You can guess how surprised I was when our tacos arrived wrapped in foil, just like Taco Cabana does in Texas, and opened my pork to find they didn't put the sauce on that I asked for and when I asked the waitress about it I got a \"deer in the headlights\" look and a rude comment.  When I got to the brisket taco it was packed with Serrano peppers and was so damn hot you couldn't taste the meat. My wife had a brisket taco also and hers was completely different from mine.   So in a quick review, 4 tacos of which at least 2 were wrong, a rude waitress, and a ticket time that a fine dining restaurant wouldn't want.  Save your time and money, go else were.  On a positive note they have a great smoker.",

I also had the queso chips.   First the service is horrible. They seem pompous and after the first time I didn't want to go back. They just reopened when I went so I did give them another chance. I shouldn't have. I even went for take out and asked if I could order and pick it up in 2 hours because they were busy they wouldn't take an order they couldn't make 3 tacos in 2 hours ridiculous. The attitude from the host was enough to not want to go back. The time I did sit to eat the wait for the food took an hour to get to us. The meat just needs cut how long can that take.   The meat was  cooked well but lacked flavor. The chips were good and fresh, but the queso cheese needs some flavor.   Over all bland food and rude staff not worth the wait.",

The rib taco was excellent, but the churizo taco was a drippy mess. My wife had the brisket  and the pork, which were both pretty great as well. The mac 'n cheese was really good, but just slightly overcooked, and a little bit watery. Those two issues keep it from being really great (compared to Union Pig and Chicken, where the mac 'n cheese is just about perfect). It's a bit pricey for tacos, but the smoky melt-in-your-mouth goodness of the meats justifies it. When you leave here, the smell of smoked meat will be stuck to your clothes!",

The brisket taco is good, but not $7 good. The amount of brisket was a tiny quantity. The mac and cheese was decent but very rich-so make sure to share with at least 2-3 others. Ended up spending $38 for four tacos and mac&cheese. Not too impressed with that and felt my money could have been spent elsewhere for higher quality food. It was nice to come during a weekday for lunch and not have to wait at all. I couldn't see myself waiting longer than 15 minutes here during a busy time at the restaurant. Service was fast and adequate-food came out in less than ten minutes.  Also, the music the restaurant had playing was sooo loud during lunch and there were only three other occupied tables at this time. Oh and remember-cash only!",

Although a single taco is expensive, it is filling and delightful. However my two favorite things are not the tacos themselves. First favorite is the queso. It is quite delicious by itself but the chips that come with it are hands down my favorite chips at any restaurant. They seem to be some sort of flour based chip instead of corn and boy o boy are they delightful. Beware, this serving is very large so I would recommend sharing with at least two people if you want to have any hope of finishing your tacos. Also the corn/broccoli side dish us AMAZING. whatever crumbly goodness they put on top should be illegal but I'm glad that it isn't. One star off because we've had bad service here and I liked it better as Byob (especially when atlas bottle works is right next door). Overall definitely a place to check out if you haven't yet.",

The tacos were so good too, the meat is amazing smoked, tender, flavorful, soooo good!!   They had some type of jalapeno lemonade that was great, super hot and lightly sweet, a must...pour some tequila in it for an added bonus. The house made marg-mix pitcher was really fresh and great, I poured a little bottle of Patron in it and suddenly didn't care about the atmosphere so much. You will GET LOST in this food, TRY IT!  One annoying thing: No reservations, only call ahead seating, but you can only call up to an hour before you come...and you can't find them on \"No Wait\" app, but that is the app they put your call ahead seat on..you have to call for some reason.",

We were skeptical at first, but stayed anyway. WOW, were we wrong. This is hands down the best burger in the Pittsburgh area. My only complaint is that they don't broadcast this awesome feature. Will be back for more burgers!",

    "text": "The chips and queso are the best I've ever had! They're pita chips that are crispy on the outside but soft on the inside and salted perfectly.  The tacos were just ok. I feel as if the flavors didn't mesh as well as they sounded. Mac and cheese was great but when ISNT Mac and cheese delicious?  I don't understand the cash only policy for a place that gets enough business to subsist and the seating is so strangely organized.   I think this restaurant gets such amazing reviews because Pittsburgh is severely lacking in two main food areas: Barbeque and Mexican food. This place tries to combine both with the hippest atmosphere they could possibly muster in Lawrenceville. All of this comes together for a very pretentious dining experience.  Overall, there is basically no restaurant in Pittsburgh that I would wait 2 hours for. There are many other options to eat around that area. I will probably only get take-out in the future.",

There was nothing spectacular about them, least of all for 5 bucks a taco. On top of all of that the restaurant layout is horrible. The tables are extremely close to one another, which can make things really loud. We also waited a hour for our food, which was just two tacos wrapped in foil. No fixings, no fresh lime, or onion. No sauce options. And we had to constantly flag down our waitress, while many attempts were being ignored. She barely checked on us.  Take my advice, go down to the strip and go to Casa Reyna. You'll get authentic tacos at a decent price, and the staff will take care of you. This place is for hipsters with no taste.",

The only 2 negatives: it was a very warm evening and the air conditioning was either Off or on very low. We were all uncomfortable. When water is served, it is served without Ice!!! It was already hot and now we were to drink uncooled water. I think not! I hate to post anything negative. While these items are relatively small, they were annoying. Overall, we had a great time!!!!!  Thanks Smoke",

    "text": "It was a little bit difficult to find. For those searching: it's the door directly to the left of the Rowhouse Theatre.  Otherwise the experience was excellent. My friends got there around 5pm on a Thursday and by the time I joined them at 5:15 they had been seated. We ordered shortly after and our food arrived in a very timely manner. I'd say we probably only waited 25 mins at the most, for 5 people to be served. Our server was nice and very helpful.  The queso and homemade chips are delicious. Everyone had great things to say about their tacos. My veggie tacos were yummy, and I think the prices are appropriate. Next time I'd like to try the brisket or chicken tacos to actually get a feel for their smoked meat.   It was a little bit chilly in there, so bring a sweater. Also, will be nice when they serve corn tortillas with their tacos - I asked the server and he said it's on the agenda. I'm sure the gluten-free folks out there will be appreciative.   Overall - we all enjoyed our meals and the atmosphere, and will be returning.",

We received some complimentary smoked nuts while we were waiting that were awesome.  They had a nice selection of drafts we both really enjoyed. For food, we ordered a pork taco, the chicken apple taco, some queso with chips, and some burnt ends which were on special. Everything was so good! Their home made flour tortilla chips were so unique and fresh. I loved that they were still a little soft, but very crunchy. Both tacos were so good, as were the burnt ends. I definitely can't wait to get back there to try out more of the menu. Would highly recommend!",

    "text": "Before I ate at Smoke, I always felt estranged from those who had horrible restaurant experiences.  Needless to say, that all changed tonight.   My wife and I put our name in at about 7 o'clock.  We were told the wait would be about an hour and half.  To our misguided surprise, about an hour later, we were contacted, telling us that our table was ready.  We quickly closed-out at the adjacent bar.  When we arrived for Table the hostess conveyed that, for some reason, seemingly beyond his control, the message was improperly  sent out and that our table would not be ready for another half hour.    Not taking this as a sign, which we would both later deeply regret, my wife and I came back after 45 minutes for a table.     After sitting down, it took about 25 minutes for a waiter  to come over.  From this point on, we might as well have been dining in purgatory.  After an hour of asking where our food was, we were told that it would be coming shortly.  So as to avoid wasting your time in any way similar to the time the staff at Smoke wasted mine; after 45 more minutes we were finally served with our food.      We didn't receive the appetizer we ordered and the food was cold.  For all of our trouble we were told that we would be compensated...  We received a 20% discount, and get this, a 15% coupon off our next visit.      It turns out that Smoke is not only incapable of giving good service, but also thinks that recipients of said service are stupid enough to return.",

    "text": "One of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh! It is a unique menu and reasonably priced, making it a go to dinner spot.  While I've never disliked anything I've ordered, my go-to order is the Pork taco (w/ caramelized onions and habanero sauce), Egg taco (w/ potato nuggets, beans, and cheese), and the Mac & Cheese. Two tacos is enough to fill me up, but the Mac & Cheese is probably my all-time favorite version of it and makes a great shared side dish. Also, be aware of their interesting specials! From pies to doughnuts or burgers, it always is delicious.   My one critique of Smoke is that the service can be quite slow. Don't be surprised if it takes 45-60 minutes for your food to be served. I'd consider the wait worth it (especially now that they serve alcohol!) but it seems to contribute to their lengthy table wait time.",

    "text": "Usually, I give places like this a 5 star unless you make my local foodie mad which the bar server did, so you get 4.  Super excited to finally see smoke open up in Lawrenceville after their presence in the Waterfront proved underappreciated. Came on a Saturday night, so we waited for a little bit [40 minutes is normal] before getting seated at the bar [something KB and I actually prefer] The place is warm and inviting, decked out in wood and engulfed in some of the most their elaborate aromas from their chorizo, to their tacos, and mac & cheese.   We had been eating and drinking our way through Lville from Slice to AWM, so we ordered small. KB had the mac & cheese and a side of the broccolini [her faves], and I had a the taco special which was a chicken with arugula, strawberries, blue cheese and pecans [pretty much my favorite salad dumped into a taco]  The mac&cheese is awesome. It's heavy and creamy with thick, sharp cheeses, a dousing of pepper and breadcrumbs that much makes you as happy as a 5 year old with a blue box. And there is a healthy portion of it. Honestly, it's called a side, but this clearly could be your entire meal. The broccolini was similar, doused with cheese and breadcrumbs, not leaving much to the delicate vegetable dish you may have been expecting. Unfortunately, this dish was a bit disappointing as most of what you taste is smoke. It completely overpowers the vegetable and put a sad pairing taste to the wine [the place is BYOB] we had brought from AWM. [we weren't expecting that flavoring in our Italian greens]  The taco was nice, I loved the blend of the pecan and blue cheese and offset with the strawberries and pepperiness of the arugula. It was also a nice size for a taco. Mounds of fillings. There is a lot of cheese clumped right in the middle, which was a shame, less would have been better, and it would have made the dish overall less heavy.   The disappearing star went for the attitude of our bar server. She started out great and helpful with specials and uncorking our wine. The checked in regularly and stopped an appropriate amount of time in order to start a tat of conversation with each patron. However, that's when things turned sour.   We had gotten into conversation about the evening and logically, the wine that we had dragged half way across Lawrenceville for here specifically. She seemed intrigued as KB mentioned it to be one of her more preferred and then offered her a taste. She accepted, poured herself a small bit, tasted it, and complimented it as a polite patron no matter her personal taste.   Then she asked for feedback on food. Naturally, as foodies, we love giving it.   We noted lovely blend of cheeses and consistency of the m&c, the unique twist on the broccolini, and I expressed my concern for the amount of blue cheese that was overpowering the taco. With each remark her blatant 'F-U' face became more and more visible. Now, we love this place and want to see it thrive so, we would have believed that feedback that had more depth than just \"It's great\" would be welcomed. We were wrong. By the end she seemed positively irked, decided it was time to move to other diners, turned, and violently dumped out the rest of the wine. Message received.   We decided the desert was best to go [but it was truly amazing pie - and was devoured later that morning], rounding out our dinner before we made out for the grapparia for a digestion drink.   All in all, this place is an above average establishment for food and atmosphere, as long as you adjust your expectation to a trendy Lville hotspot [waits and attitude] and definitely a place that will [and has been] returned to.",

Two people just wanted mac n' cheese, one just wanted to drink and the other 3, including myself, were really excited to try the tacos. I ordered one chorizo and one wagyu brisket taco. Both were spicy and good but lacked in the veggies department. My boyfriend was a mac n' cheese eater and I thought it was ok but he was not a fan at all. The noodles were pretty overcooked but I did appreciate the sharpness of the cheese.  All in all, the food was not a major issue. I will most likely not be coming back to Smoke because the wait to get our food was insane. We waited close to an hour for 8 tacos and two orders of mac n' cheese. I have heard people complaining about waiting for food before but that seemed mostly when the new location had just opened so I figured it would work itself out. Unfortunately, the wait is too long that it cancels the positives. Luckily, there are great taco places all around Pittsburgh. So my need to go to Smoke is non existent.",

    "text": "With a larger, more conveniently-located restaurant in Lawrenceville, Smoke's hype had gone through the roof, but I think it's finally slowing a bit. Is the hype worth a 2-hour wait? Never...but the food IS, indeed, quite excellent!   The new space is open and offers plenty of seating in comparison to its predecessor in Homestead, with old high school gym materials and industrial pig sculptures offering a nice reclaimed vibe that's so familiar these days. The staff is usually really nice and the food comes out quickly, so if you insist on waiting for a table, at least you know the table turnover is pretty fast! We usually just go when they open, and we're in and out of there in 30 minutes or so.   Obviously, admiring metal pigs and sitting on old gym bleachers isn't why you'd venture to Smoke. You're there to eat...and they serve up some AWESOME tacos. With their amazing buttermilk tortillas that continue to set the standard for durable vehicles for bbq smoked meats-to-mouth delivery, they already have an edge over other taqueria-inspired restaurants. Then, factor in their deliciously-simple tacos, featuring smoked meats (or potato nuggets, if you're not a carnivore), and it's hard to go wrong! My go-to options are the brisket taco and the pork, but I don't really discriminate, and I've had nearly every taco on the menu. Also, keep an eye out for the chicken & waffle taco, with cornbread fried chicken with cornbread fritters and blackberry (I think) jalapeno syrup. Unreal stuff!  The sides are good, too. The mac & cheese is filthy, and we always get the jalapeno apple slaw. That stuff is amazing! The special desserts that Smoke makes are also worth a try. They've always been heavy hitters that'll leave you in a food coma, but some of their pies are definitely worth it!  Overall, Smoke's hype is mostly warranted. We've been there countless times, and rarely walk away disappointed, but it helps that we go when the place is dead. I'd recommend you do the same! Enjoy!",

It's definitely a very trendy place. Lots of exposed brick, wood, and cool lighting. I only stopped in for drinks, so I cannot speak to the food.   It was a Friday night and I was a bit disappointed to find that they were closing at midnight because I would have loved to spend more time here. They had a late night happy hour beginning at 11 pm which got us half off beers and $5 margaritas. The experience was all pretty great. Bartenders were nice and helpful in drink selections. The only downside was that it's a cash-only establishment, but there was an ATM located in the back for convenience. Definitely a sweet spot for a date night.",

When we were finally called from our bar hangout next door, we walked past many couples and groups waiting to sit through the unmarked door. There aren't many seats in this joint, but I feel the experience was worth the wait.  Our waiter was fantastic, taking care with every order and very attentive. We ordered several appetizers, but did I mention it's BYOB? Make sure you stop next door at the 6 pack shop to pick up a few drinks before stopping in.  As for the food, the tacos are spicy, and they do not mess around! They are way larger than I expected and two were more than enough.  We also tried the Mac and cheese, topped with brisket. I know a lot of people saw that this place or that has the best M&C, but this one takes the cake.",

As soon as you open the door, the smell of smoke hits you right away. Smelled delicious. The hubby and I came here late on a Friday night and the wait for a table was 30 minutes. Luckily, the bar was empty so that's where we sat. The bartender was super helpful, friendly, and attentive.  The bartender told us that most people get two tacos or one taco and a side and that's enough to fill you. We were skeptical of that but we took his advice anyway. Hubby got the ribs taco and the burnt ends taco. I got the chicken apple taco along with a side of their special side that day: macaroni salad. I would say that the amount of food suggested by the bartender was accurate for me, but not so much for the hubby. He probably could have gotten two or three more to be satisfied. Anyway, of the three tacos, my favorite was the ribs; it was so moist and flavorful. I absolutely loved the bbq flavor. The chicken apple had a nice contrast of flavors and textures and was surprisingly spicy, which I enjoyed. Burnt ends was my least favorite as there was little depth of flavor; all you could taste was smoke. Although it was delicious for a few bites, it seemed like a flavor that I would get sick of after a while.   I found the tacos to be a bit pricey and the fact that they only take cash makes it a little less convenient. However, I would definitely come back. The service was great and the food was delicious!",

    "text": "In my humble opinion, Smoke is one of the best places to get BBQ in Pittsburgh. It just happens that their delicious meat tends to come in tacos, but this is not a traditional taco place. Also, their new menu has a stronger focus on standard BBQ fare (ribs, etc.) while still offering 5 or so flagship tacos.  My favorite tacos are the brisket (so, so good -- worth every penny of the price, in my opinion) and the pulled pork. I love that habanero sauce that they put on the pork taco.  It's a great sauce to ask for on the side if you get their mac and cheese, too. I tend not to love m&c because it tends to be bland, fatty, and uninspired feeling. Smoke makes one of the few m&c's in the city that I actually like -- it's super garlicky and flavorful (sharp cheeses) with just the right mixture of textures.  On Tuesdays, they do not serve their normal menu; instead, they do burgers only!  I really think that they make the best (basic) burger I've had in Pittsburgh.  Good beef, nice and smoky flavor, and that BUN is to die for.  It comes out so warm, so soft, it's probably the best burger bun I've had in recent memory.  The agua fresca is really great for summer, and it seems like you can get it with gin or tequila. The gin cucumber agua fresca is my new favorite drink for the hot months of summer. It is so refreshing!  Be mindful that this place can get quite busy during peak hours, but its popularity is well deserved!!",

    "text": "Smoke's new location in Lawrenceville is somewhat hidden for now until they get signage.  Not going to lie, I walked right by it twice.  But in case you need to know, it is right next to Row House Cinema on Butler Street.  Depending on when you go in, it might be packed to the gills or empty with only a few patrons.  I was lucky enough to find only two other patrons at the bar when I stopped in one random weekday afternoon after exploring a few other shops in the neighborhood.    I'd been to Smoke's previous Homestead location so I knew what to expect.  Cash only with just a few items to choose from.  Nothing too crazy as far as tacos but the combination of ingredients will usually awaken the taste buds.  I went with tres tacos: the chorizo, chicken and brisket.  All were delightful, but just like my last Smoke experience I felt like it was a little pricey.  Service was friendly and I didn't wait long, but I'm sure when there's a line of people out the door service isn't as friendly, fast or efficient.    I want to try the mac n cheese but haven't yet, mostly because, again, I'm turned off by the cost ($7 for what doesn't look like a very big portion).  If/when I return, it will be the first thing I order.  I hope to update my review with an extra star after a taste.",

Every Sunday, I seem to come here in search of that amazingness and I have turned up empty far too many times recently.   Smoke is still BYOB right now, but I think that they are getting their liquor license soon.  I love BYOB places, but whether Smoke is or is not, it would not matter to me... the food and service is great, the vibe is chill, and an overall experience is always excellent.  I love the pork taco... it seems to be the standard that I often keep turning to.  The brisket BLT, chicken, etc. are all good as well.  The tacos are served on heavenly buttermilk tortillas. Some of the best tortillas ever if you ask me!  I am also quite obsessed with their Jalapeno and Apple Slaw... soooooooo incredibly tasty and refreshing.  Smoke is definitely on my top ten list of places that I will miss when I leave Pgh... and when I return, it will be one of the few places that I cannot wait to come back to!",

    "text": "Smoke was one of the first restaurants I checked out when I moved to Lawrenceville last year, and it remains one of my favorites. You feel the classic Lawrenceville vibe as soon as you walk in the door: rustic, hipster, and a few contemporary touches. On any given night you'll find this hotspot packed with both locals and tourists.  Word to the wise: call ahead. They do not take reservations, but will take your name down if you are on your way. You'll be able to cut a good chunk of time off your wait by doing this. Smoke is rather small and even on weeknights your wait can be 45 minutes to an hour at peak dinner times.  The menu is concise yet well-rounded, which I appreciate. This is a restaurant where you'll discover your favorite items and want to get the same ones every time you come. For me, it's the chips and queso as an appetizer and the chicken apple bacon taco as an entree. The chips are made in-house and are kind of like a pita/tortilla hybrid. The queso is rich and sharp. The chicken apple bacon taco is one of their most popular, with good reason. I've tried other tacos here and always come back to this one. The apples provide a sweetness that contrasts perfectly with the saltiness of the chicken and bacon. The sauce has a zing to it but is not too spicy. Pair this duo with a delicious agua fresca (flavored water made fresh daily), and you've got yourself quite a delicious meal.  Unfortunately I find no choice but to deduct a star for inconsistency. I've been to Smoke probably ten times or so, and I find that wait times for food vary immensely. Just a couple weeks ago my friends and I ordered chips and queso and it was brought out in under five minutes. Today, however, we waited almost 35 minutes for our queso to come out of the kitchen (on a Monday, no less). We were only told that things were \"backed up back there\" and that it would \"hopefully be out soon.\" I understand that Smoke does a lot of take-out orders and that it's a bit unpredictable for them. However, the inconsistency in food preparation times makes it almost impossible for you to plan an evening around dinner here. If you come and you're in a rush, you may be disappointed. Despite the inconsistency, I'm always willing to wait for one of these tacos.",

    "text": "I have heard awesome things about Smoke, so I was excited to try. The atmosphere was hipster/trendy, but very small. They accept reservations for groups, but the location honestly isn't ideal for them. Our wait was said to be 1.5 -2 hours, which we expected at 5:30 on a Saturday night with 7 people. Sadly, our 2 hour wait turned into almost 3 hours, and we had already invested so much time we stayed. Some of us had seats at the bar, so we at least got an appetizer and some drinks while we waited. Once we were sat, we ordered pretty quickly (we had already looked at the menu like 10 times while we waited), but the food took about 45 minutes to come out.   The food was good, but it wasn't good enough for me to risk this wait time very often. I had the bbq plate with brisket and chicken. It was a VERY large portion which was great, because I wanted two sides and wanted to share. Everyone else got tacos, and for the most part they were pleased. The chips we got with the queso were awesome, a combination of a pita and a chip, so I would definitely recommend those. I also loved that they have $4 cans of beer in addition to a decent draft list, wine, and mixed drinks.   Bottom line - Smoke is definitely a cool place to check out, but you will for sure be waiting a while if you have a group, and there will realistically be a wait for 2-3 people too. You can put your name on the list, so do yourself a favor...and do it. Also, this is a cash only place. You can never say you don't know though, because it is literally plastered everywhere.",

The service is always kind and the atmosphere is relaxed and trendy.   The switch from the byob policy to a full bar is the only reason it got less than 5 stars in my review. Although the new policy won't stop be from coming completely (nothing can keep me away from the queso), I loved being able to bring my own wine or fave beer to accompany my tacos.",

There is almost no waiting space inside, so be prepared to go elsewhere while you wait for your table. The interior has muted lighting and a warm color palette. Be sure to look at the open kitchen. The fresh baked bread smelled delicious.   I had to catch my movie, so I didn't get a $6 taco (yes, a single taco), but I did get to try the mac and cheese with brisket on top. I was disappointed by the portion (similar size to Panera's mac for 1.5x the price). The flavor made up for the small portion, cheesy noodly goodness with soft, seasoned brisket. Yum yum.   Next time I'll be prepared with the No Wait App. Smoke has caught my interest, I'll keep you updated.",

    "text": "Another awesome taco joint in Pittsburgh. I love the rustic feel of the restaurant. My friend and I started the meal with the queso and I would say it was the highlight of the meal. The homemade chips were the best chips I've ever had a restaurant. They weren't too crispy or too soft and they tasted so fresh. The queso was also probably the best queso I've ever eaten.   For my actual meal I got a rib taco with a side of the Mac. The meat on the taco was a little chewy but it had a good taste. I think they make homemade pickles and they are very spicy and good. The Mac n cheese was also delicious but I think it would have been better with meat on it.   Overall I think tako has better tacos despite what a lot of people have said. I was told the tacos were better and cheaper at smoke but I personally disagree. Tacos at smoke are sold as 1 taco versus 2 per order at tako making them almost he same price depending on which option you pick at smoke. However the tacos were still good and the queso was amazing so they still get a 5 star rating.",

    "text": "Overall Impression: Plenty of personality to catch your interest and make you return to taste more---just make sure you have the time and the cash (yes actual dollar bills) to make it to this popular Lawrenceville spot.   The Food: Ordered pickup to take back to the office. I ordered the Chicken Taco and I split the house queso with my coworkers. The Chicken taco had the meat, avocado cream, pickled onions, and cilantro. I expected for $6 to have more topping options, so I added mushrooms myself for an extra $1.50. Even with the expensive extra toppings and cream, the taco was VERY onion-y. It overwhelmed any other flavor the taco could have had, because I didn't taste anything else. So I couldn't tell if the meat itself was bland, or if the onions ruined the other flavors. I've seen both complaints on this thread. They also warned me it was spicy, but it didn't taste spicy.The house queso was filled with awesome additions like avocado pieces, chicken, and hot sauce--but the cheese itself was watery and bland. It's probably personal preference, but I expect queso to be thicker and a bit spicy, and theirs was neither. It did come with some really awesome pita chips, though. They were seasoned well and the perfect amount of crunch.  **If you're ordering for lunch, you only need one taco. You'll THINK you need two. But don't listen to yourself--you only need one. You'll thank me later.**   The Restaurant: You can smell the restaurant from outside on the street, but you wouldn't know it's them--their entrance is relatively difficult to find, and very easy to miss in the dark. You would think they're a speakeasy! The only definitive mark on their door is a medium-sized \"S\" with their name printed very small on the door with the restaurant's hours. I suggest they invest in a chalkboard to put on the sidewalk (or something).   Inside is intimate, warm, and full of character. At the front is a wall of freshly chopped wood (and who doesn't LOVE that smell?!) and it immediately puts you in a BBQ \"mode.\" The branding of this place is amazing, honestly. The girls at the bar were pleasant when we picked up our order. The \"cash only\" bit will always be an annoyance to anyone under the age of 35, the price tag will be enough to grind some people's gears, and the fact that you need to put be on their NoWait App in person and THEN wait two hours to be seated will make some people just walk....but if you can get past those three things you might be good. I will be trying their food again, but it didn't have the tastes I expected the first time around.  TL;DR: This place walks the walk but they need to talk the talk. Their price tag (6-$7.50 PER taco) is high and the although I can tell the quality of ingredients is there and the place looks great, the flavor palette and portion size just doesn't match up.  Give it a couple tries, but if it ends up not being what you expect, I'd move on.",

    "text": "Okay, I admit it. I kind of wanted to hate this place. This is purely based on what I've heard from others, of course, but I got the impression that it was one of those hipster, annoyingly trendy, trying-hard-to-be-cool-while-pretending-not-to-try places.   And....it is kind of all of those things. But the service and food completely won me over...so it is impossible now for me to hate :)  First thing's first....yes, it's crazy busy here. On a Sunday night at 7, there was an hour wait. They do use the NoWait app, but you can't just sign into the app and put yourself on the list like with other restaurants. Because Smoke is so cool and different ;) they don't conform to the normal NoWait M.O.....instead you have to call them on the phone to get in line. Then they will text you a link to the app that will let you track your place.  Because it was so busy, we said we were willing to eat at the bar, and that's where we were seated. The bar seating is tight, so it kind of sucked rubbing elbows (literally) with the random dude beside me...but first world problems, right?  The barista was our server and she was super attentive and sweet. Because we had not been there before, she explained their concept and gave us recommendations on how much food to order (2 tacos per person is apparently standard).  We started with an order of the \"Hot Bowl of Cheese\", which is essentially the best freaking queso I've ever had in my life. It's a mild cheese sauce spiked with smoked peppers and onions....crazy flavorful. It's served with homemade flour tortilla chips fried to a consistency that is simultaneously crispy and chewy. If I had magical powers, I would seriously consider hooking myself up to an IV of cheese sauce that I could tote around with me wherever I went. It was so, so good.  For dinner, I got a veggie taco and my hubby got the special taco of the day (which was a chicken and waffle taco). Then we split an order of mac and cheese. Although they recommended two tacos per person, between the queso appetizer and the mac and cheese side, one taco each was more than enough for us (and in fact, we took most of the mac home). The tacos were OUTSTANDING. It can be hard to make a veggie taco interesting, but they managed to pack it with smoky and spicy flavors. And the chicken and waffle taco was to die for....perfectly crisp chicken, soft waffles, and a sweet/spicy blueberry jalapeno sauce. Putting all of those flavors and textures together might have made for the world's most perfect bite. And let's not forget about the mac and cheese! It was insanely delicious....rich and creamy with a super sharp cheese sauce (I LOVE mac and cheese with a bite!)  To wash everything down, we tried both flavors of their agua frescas that they had that day (cantaloupe and watermelon). Both were super refreshing, fruity, and lightly sweet. A perfect complement to our meals.  The only downside here is their prices. YIKES. Be prepared to open your wallet. Psychologically, it's hard to pay $8.00+ for a side of mac and cheese or $7.50 for a single taco.....but they really do back up their prices with amazingly fresh, homemade, flavorful food. So I guess that eases the pain a little? Oh, and speaking of prices, it's cash only...which I find annoying. I mean, it's 2015...at this point, I think I should be able to beam payment directly from my eyeballs to the restaurant. But whatever. Credit cards are probably too mainstream for Smoke ;) So I will begrudgingly pull out the cash for my super-high-priced, but super-freaking-delicious tacos. :)",

It came rolled up in foil and the taste and quantity of onions was overwhelming, I couldn't taste anything else.  $14 for queso and chips? Granted the chips were delicious, the bowl of queso was pretty small for the amount charged.   Not to mention this place is cash only--with a bill of $70 for TWO people (before tip)--luckily my friend had enough cash and I was able to pay him back.

They remained BYOB in Lawrenceville for awhile. And I really, really miss that aspect. You used to be able to stroll in, pop your six pack in the old fridge there, and settle in for awhile. Given the byob aspect, you didn't mind paying 6-8 dollars for a taco, because you could still get out of there for less than 50 bucks. Those days are long gone now. Their alcohol is way overpriced, and if you want a few drinks with your meal, a couple out for lunch is in for $80, $90, even $100+. For tacos and a few glasses of wine. It's a pain. Oh, and they're STILL cash only. Not sure how they get away with that.  I have to address the slowness complaints in other reviews. For years, Smoke was slower than molasses. And that was okay by me. I kind of subscribe to the French philosophy of restaurant service - most of the time, I'm there to slowly drink, chat, and stretch the meal out over the course of a couple hours. I don't want the waiter stopping by every 5 minutes to ask if I need anything. Smoke reminded me of that style of service. That was always True, until the last year or so. Some process in the kitchen has changed and the food basically comes right out now. I haven't had to wait more than 15-25 minutes in quite awhile, busy or slow. So, speed of service is really no longer an issue.  Okay. The food. My disclaimer is I basically only get tacos at smoke. Sometimes we'll grab a side, but I find that the sides only serve to take up much needed taco real estate in my stomach. That said, the sides are generally good to great. The mac and cheese is killer.  I know they have ribs now, and Tuesdays are burger nights (exclusively). Which sucks, quite frankly. I'm not coming to a place called Smoke Taqueria for a burger. I'm coming for the smoked... taqos.  Anyway. All of the tacos are generally outstanding, my favorites being Chicken Apple and Brisket. If you go to smoke enough, you'll find that they're pretty inconsistent in terms of taco flavor, texture, and heat. Homestead Smoke used to absolutely bring the heat. I remember trying to get through some of those tacos - it was was like some form of exquisite torture. Pouring sweat, pounding beer, and begging for sweet mercy.   For the most part, they've dialed back the heat. But sometimes you'll still get one that will rip your face off. It's a coin-flip, really. There are similar inconsistencies with the ratio of ingredients on any of the signature tacos. It's all good though - it's part of what keeps me coming back. Always something slightly different than last time.   So this review probably hasn't helped you in any way. And for that, I am sorry. My suggestion would be to go down to Smoke, get some tacos, break out the wallet and pay (cash) for some over-priced craft beer, and have yourself a day. Odds are you'll like it.",

    "text": "We were looking for a new place to try in Lawrenceville last Saturday night and thanks to Yelp we found this place.  It is very small inside with not a ton of seating and luckily they do call ahead seating. I called about 40 minutes before we arrived and it was an hour and half wait.  We were lucky enough to get a seat at the bar 20 minutes after we arrived.  My only complaint of the night was the service at the bar was very very slow. I waited over 25 minutes to put in a drink order-we only got 2 cans of beer (Victory Summer Love) which took another 10 or so minutes. They have a pretty extensive drink list but I was not that impressed with the draft and bottle beer list.  We put in an appetizer for the queso and chips which was very tasty.  White cheese with the perfect amount of spice and homemade chips. By the time we started our app our table was ready.  Our server was great and the order came out quickly.  I got the pork taco with the coffee sauce which is supposedly the least spicy of their sauces (wow it still had a smoky kick to it). For my side I went with the grilled corn bread which was just ok-tasted more like a corn bread French toast.  My fiance ordered a bbq sandwich and the mac and cheese. I highly recommend the mac and cheese (all of their sandwiches come with a side)-again that white cheddar goodness.  The portions are pretty hefty so we had enough for leftovers the next day.  It is a bit pricey ( 6-7$ for 1 taco) but worth the price.",

And then it took another hour for them to bring our tacos out.  Any reasonable person probably would have asked to speak to management at that point (or just up and leave if you're my mother, thank God she wasn't there), but not only did I keep my mouth shut, I gave Smoke a second chance.  Unfortunately, Smoke dropped the ball again.  We were told 45 minutes to 60 minutes to seat our party of 5.  We decided to wait.  One hour and twenty minutes later, they were cleaning off a table for us.  This time the tacos were brought out at a reasonable time, thankfully.  But other small things happened - like we ordered drinks that were never brought out (but we were charged for), we were all sharing their Queso dip (which is the only reason this review has 2 stars, because it was very good) and the waitress took it before we were finished.  The staff has a \"reserved\" kindness.  I'm not sure if I don't appear hip enough to eat there or what.  People are choosing to eat at your restaurant, act excited! Greet them with enthusiasm! Thank them for coming in, etc.  The hostess barely looked up from her iPad when she \"greeted\" me and put the name in.  But, people seem to love Smoke.  So if you decide to go, I truly hope you have a better experience than mine.",

The wait was half an hour around dinner time for two people, so we just walked around Lawrenceville in the meantime, waiting for the text notification that our table was ready.   The setup is interesting inside. It looks like more space is set aside for the decorations than the seating area, but I guess it's working out for them. I ordered the migas taco because I like eggs, and smoked red cabbage because that sounded interesting. I noticed that some of the sides cost more than the tacos. The wait wasn't too long for the food, which came out wrapped in foil and the little cauldron-like thing for the smoked red cabbage.   To be honest, the migas taco reminded me of the sausage egg and cheese burrito at McDonald's with some spice and green bell pepper--but I still liked it. I think it was the cheesiness that made me first think of that. The smoked cabbage had a surprising flavor. The smoky-ness was very nice and powerful, which I really liked.   I'd want to come back and try their other tacos too. Also it's BYOB at $1.75 a person.",

The queso dip is unreal, and the bread they serve with it is so warm and perfect. Nice job there. And there is a ton of it, we didn't finish.   For tacos, we got the Migas, Egg, Chorizo and Pork. We made these a little custom, but they were great. The tortillas are warm and fresh, and don't break!  The chorizo was just ok, I probably wouldn't get that again. It was more ground chorizo, not sausage form which I was expecting. The egg was incredible, I got it with Rib meat and avacado cream, both nice touches. That was the best around.   And we ended with a freshly baked cookie, chocolate and PB.  Great place, go there.",

It took a few weeks to get here but Smoke didn't disappoint.   The tacos are amazing. The Pork Taco was tender and juicy with a slight spice from the apricot habanero salsa. Mmmmm. The Apple Chicken was really good too, but not my personal favorite. My wife also got the Pork Taco and thought it was really good. I also got an Egg Breakfast Taco out of curiosity and now know I can come here for a late breakfast! I tried her Brisket Taco and wished I had gotten that instead of the Chicken Apple, although she thought it was a little too spicy. The Mac and Cheese was perfection. Creamy and tasty with a lovely baked crust on the top. Some of the best I've had.   We brought beer to drink and they even kept it in fridge for us to keep it cold. The server was very friendly and helpful with menu choices. He even told us we could call ahead and put our name on the list to save time.   While I originally thought the prices for a single taco were high ($5-7 each) I now edit my thinking because they were absolutely worth the price. Smoke is delicious and trendy, and definitely worth the recommendation. We'll be back!",

Their new location in Lawernceville is very cool with a wooden and rustic interior. When I visited, they were piping in some old school rap that made for a fun brunch atmosphere. We got the Mac and cheese and queso to start. The Mac and cheese was good but didn't stand out as a signature dish. The queso was very flavorful and the homemade chips added to the dish. The breakfast tacos were well flavored and had a nice punch to them. We will defiantly be back.",

They use an ipad wait list and you get a text when your table is ready.  We waited just long enough to pick out some beers.  The waitstaff uses iphones to take orders and it goes directly to the point of sales system and to the kitchen.  Very efficient.  The weird part is that they don't take cards.  They are very high-tech, but they don't take cards?  They also don't have a website.  They rely on a stinkin' Facebook page.  And Google Plus (?!)  I don't know if they are working on these things.  Also: it's pretty loud.  Not a great place for a first date.",

They called us an hour before our reservation and told us they wouldn't be able to seat us for an hour later than our reservation. We were already in the area and had friends in from 4 hours out of town. We finally got sat an hour later than our reservation. Apparently they didn't like us and decided not to serve us so we had to leave. They were really just waiting for us to leave so that they could seat their friends who walked in waiting for a table last minute. To top it all off, when we tried to voice our opinion to the manager, he had to hold back from laughing in our face (along with the other employees). It must be nice for business to be so well that they can pick and choose their clients. Not to mention there were ten of us. Extremely disappointed in what this place has to offer.",

    "text": "Decided to try out Smoke last night on a whim with the husband and I was not disappointed. We started with their special of chicken wings with homemade bleu cheese dressing. The size of the wings were a little small, but they made up for it with flavor. I was expecting a franks type buffalo sauce and instead I was pleasantly surprised with an almost tomato spicy sauce. The bleu cheese dressing was obviously homemade and delicious. We continued to order our tacos, we did the egg, chicken, rib, and chorizo. Egg and chorizo would have been perfect for a hangover breakfast. Chicken was great, but that Rib Taco... it was literally the best taco my husband and I have ever had... EVER! Now to ask for $6.50 for a single taco is a pretty high price, therefore setting a high standard. But I would have literally paid upwards of $10 for that taco and it still would've been worth it. We also got the mac-n-cheese and it was delicious as well. It said it used marscapone cheese which gave it almost a light flavor instead of typical heavy mac-n-cheese. Our service was on point as well. Our server was prompt in checking in, clearing plates, and making sure we needed. At one point I told my husband that I needed more napkins for my wing soaked fingers. About 10 seconds later the other server came by and dropped off more napkins. Now that is good service! She must've overheard me. The total overall experience was great! The only complaint I would have is that it is BYOB... but hey, a lot of people like that however we are typically cocktail drinkers. Also that it is CASH ONLY. We had cash so it is not a big deal but I think it would be more accommodating if that they would at least give you the option to pay with a card. Two minor things overlooked for that delicious food and prompt service. We will be returning soon!",

    "text": "Our first experience with smoke was a 3/5. My boyfriend and I ordered the coleslaw, which was average, the pork and ribs tacos, which were just far too dry to enjoy, and the queso, which is amazing.   The only reason we decided to go back a second time was for the delicious queso. We called in to get our name put on the list and they told us our table would we ready in a 75 minutes. We then downloaded the NoWait app which they suggested downloading after making our reservation, which told us how many parties were ahead of us. After about 45 minutes we received the text that our table was ready and if we did not arrive in 10 minutes our table would be given away, even though the app told us there were 7 parties still ahead of us! I promptly called the restaurant again to tell them there is no way we would get there in time as we live 15 minutes away. The person who answered the phone was quite rude and explained how they don't even use the app. I also told her that according to her time when we originally called in, we still had 30 more minutes to arrive.   Needless to say when we finally got there, which was well before her original 75 minute estimate, our table had been given away. Essentially, the only way to secure your table is to wait there the entire time because they have no way of estimating how long it will take. So if you want to waste and entire night waiting for your table, unable to wait at home, smoke is for you.  We had already driven all the way to the restaurant so we just put our name back on the list. We waited for another 35 minutes and finally got seated. We ordered the chicken and brisket tacos, broccolini and corn, and queso. The chicken taco was by far the worst taco I have ever had. After one bite my stomach was hurting from how spicy it was (so if you like really spicy maybe you will like this taco). I unfolded the taco and contents were some bland chicken in a bland avocado sauce, and a huge amount of hot sauce covering the entire thing. I tried to eat some of the chicken not covered by the sauce, but the chicken alone wasn't very appetizing. My boyfriend had a similar experience with the brisket taco. Although the brisket meat was good, the taco was difficult to enjoy because the only flavor that it contained was extreme spiciness. It seems that because the tacos don't really have any flavor, they try to add flavor by just putting on more hot sauce. If you like hot sauce, then I'm sure you would like their tacos. The broccolini and corn was good, and the queso was very yummy again.  Overall we will not return to Smoke because we do not wish to waste our whole night waiting in the restaurant to secure a table, the front desk staff was rude in dealing with the whole wait list system, and the taco are just really not good at all and leave your stomach hurting from how spicy it is.",

The beer selection is small, but high quality and the cocktails good.   As far as the food is concerned, it was good but not amazing. The pork taco was spicy and good. The chicken was bland and disappointing.    My biggest gripe was the service on a Sunday was awful, with a virtually empty early dinner crowd (5:30). We waited 10 minutes just to get waters and our server was slow with the first round of drinks and \"Misremembered\" our 2nd round so that we were finished eating by the time they arrived.  With so many more satisfying, better efforts nearby (Tender, Franktuary, Cure, and Round Corner), I can't imagine why we'd go back   The cash only is annoying in this day and age.",

After working many years in a restaurant as a waitress I understand this may be to help turnover time for tables, but it doesn't help customer satisfaction. Also, it is a little pricey to be cash only. Again, this may be to save money for the restaurant but it feels a little archaic. With that said, I love the food (especially the mac and cheese with chorizo) and they mix a great cocktail.",
