Everything was great, I tried the \"Zombie\" drink which was nice and tropical. They have a nice selection of appetizers and my grilled chicken salad that was made with fresh fruit was fabulous! The server was very nice and attentive. I was also a fan of the fact the menu had the calorie information beside each item, it helped me make smarter choices in selecting my meal, I think all restaurants should start doing that. Lastly, I would like to say I enjoyed the island vibe that the entire restaurant had.",

    "text": "Every once in a while I get a craving for jerk chicken pasta, which leads me right back to Bahama Breeze, so I was pleased when my group decided to go there last night.  I've never been disappointed with that dish, so it's my go-to, but I've also had the Cuban sandwich, the tilapia entree, the habanero wings, the goat cheese appetizer and these haven't disappointed me either.  I can't say that Bahama Breeze is absolutely amazing, which is why it won't get 5 stars from me, but for a chain restaurant I am impressed with the consistent quality and service that I receive there.  If you are in Robinson and craving some island fare head to Bahama Breeze and you should not be disappointed.  Oh, I almost forgot, and this may be unique to the Bahama Breeze in Robinson, but any time I've gone they have a live musician playing  Caribbean style music, which adds to the background quite nicely.",

    "text": "This was my first visit to Bahama Breeze and I didn't know what to expect. We went on a Saturday night and the place was packed. Believe it or not, they had a 1 hour wait. But that's okay, we managed to find an empty chair in the huge foyer. Turns out that they have the best Pina Coladas ever. I had a Ultimate Pina Colada - swirled with strawberry ice and topped with Myers's Dark Rum and BJ had a couple Red Stripe beers. Yum. The wait time flew by, thanks in part to the island atmosphere and the live island music.   The host staff was great. When we were finally seated, we got a huge booth. Our server was pretty sad. I'm not sure what industry she should work in, but definitely not in the service industry. But we managed to get thru okay.   We shared a new appetizer on the menu. We got a Crab, Shrimp, Mango and Avocado Stack. It was a little stack of jumbo lump crabmeat, chilled shrimp, fresh avocados and apple-mango salsa layered and stacked; with a spicy honey-red pepper drizzle served on some frisee lettuce. The drizzle was very hot and the seafood was incredibly fresh. We loved it!   For dinner, Jim had Calypso Shrimp Linguine. It was spicy shrimp sauteed with garlic, scallions, creole spices and a touch of cream. The portion was huge and very delicious. I had the Jamaican Grilled Chicken Breast with mango glaze, served with fresh mango pineapple salsa, cinnamon mashed sweet potatoes and green beans. Very good.   For dessert, we shared a Chocolate Island. It was a chocolate mousse on a fudge brownie in a milk chocolate sauce and vanilla bean anglaise with vanilla ice cream. Very yummy.   We loved the restaurant and can't wait to visit again!",

    "text": "Jordan and I were once big fans of Bahama Breeze.  Their menu was always unique and does offer some healthier options.  Since we live in ShadySide, anytime we found ourselves out in Robinson, we had always made it a point to make a stop.  Our most recent visit, we have both agreed, was our very last.   If you have read my reviews, you may know that I do not like to give bad reviews based on just server performance.  However, it was the ENTIRE EXPERIENCE that has inspired us to give up Corporate Chains like Bahama Breeze completely. We went on rainy Labor Day Monday.  Since I was once a server, whether it's nice our or whether it's crappy out, Labor Day is ALWAYS busy.  People are off and don't want to cook - plain and simple.  Apparently their manager just got hired yesterday because they were extremely under-staffed, and the energy of the place showed it.  First of all, the hostess that greeted us was visibly irritated that people kept flowing through the door; but quoted us a 20 minute wait.  We waited for 60. Still, being understanding and patient, we let the mis-quoted wait time slide, even though other patrons were getting more visibly irritated at this fact.   When we were finally seated, we were seated at a table that faced the open kitchen.  I don't care where we sit - I really don't.  I always appreciated the Open Kitchen at Bahama Breeze; therefore, servers and line cooks couldn't engage in \"bad habits\" or bad food practices.  NOT SO ON THIS OCCASION!   We watched plates being stacked on top of other plates in the window (WHAT?!?!  SERIOUSLY!?!?  I would have been fired from 5 restaurants if I would have done that); we watched servers eating french fries and shrimp right off of people's plates on the line (which I have seen people get fired for!).  Then, after watching servers eat off the plates, they would touch their faces, and then grab the plates to take them to the tables. While waiting for our server, I hate to sound snobby, but every single server looked like they hadn't showered in a week; therefore, whomever was going to serve us, I was going to be grossed out by their lacking appearance.  Every single server, contrary to the frantic kitchen, was a slow-paced tortoise not giving a crap about the food piling up in the windows, the Expo yelling for food runners, and some guests still not having CLEAN silverware.  Every single server, male or female, was very un-kept, all had hair in their faces, and chewed food in front of their tables.  Eww.  Eww.  Eww.  When our server finally did greet us - OMG she was way over-perky.  Annoyingly perky, scripted, and high-pitched.  When she finally took our food and drink order, our waters came right away; however, it took a few minutes for Jordan to get his beer. *(Oh - and did I forget to mention that even during the long wait - that there were still about 20 open tables and 6 servers standing around?*) Then the wait for the food.  Jordan and I (who actually met working together as line cooks, 4 years ago) just watched the kitchen drown frantically.  Then I watched the Manager jump on the line - and that's when I knew it was all over from there.  When ANY Front of House manager jumps on the back of the line - just watch out.  Your food is going to SUCK!  Especially when every ticket that comes in, the Manager rolls his eyes.  Um...that is your job isn't it?  To make food and serve it to guests.  If you're rolling eyes dude...then PLEASE do the guests at Bahama Breeze a huge favor and leave and find a different calling. Also - if Bahama Breeze is going to rock the Open Kitchen in the first place - that kitchen better ALWAYS run a tight ship.  Plus - the windows through that open kitchen should at least look they were washed in the morning.  Not caked on grease that hadn't been touched in a week!!!  Does anyone do sidework there?  The mistakes that we saw MAY NOT been so bad, or disgusting, had we not seen them.  But since everything was in plain sight, it made it that much worse, and hard to swallow when we did finally get our food (literally). We saw our plates get put on the line.  And then we saw them sit for 20 minutes.  Without even an extensive knowledge of the menu, Jordan and I probably could have taught their kitchen a lesson or two.  We just watched our food sit there while the Expo and multiple servers just walked pass.  Not their table, not their problem, right?   As we watched our food just sit in the window, our server came over to us and asked \"So how is everything going?\".  Ummm...we really didn't know how to respond - did she really not see we had nothing in front of us besides two waters and one bottle of beer?  I said, \"Oh the water is delicious.  Where is our food?\" Finally a different server ran out our food and informed us that the plates were \"really hot.\"  Yeah I know - I saw them sit in a heat lamp for 20 minutes.   Food tasted dry...like it had been under a heat lamp for 20 minutes. Need I say more?",

    "text": "I will admit that General Mills did a good thing by spinning off its restaurants into Darden Restaurants in the mid 1990's quality and innovativeness has gone up across the board. So I was expecting good things from a chain restaurant.  The chain creates is one of the nicest casual dining ambiances that I have been into lately. The Beech house concept with wrap around porch, live music, fire pits, etc was beautifully done.   The biggest complaint I had was their Mojito - having lived in Florida for several years I have had many Mojito's and there's was not very good. First of all they get compliments for using spearmint - too many bars use mint, but spearmint is much closer to yerba Buena that is used in Cuba. A True mojito is actually complex drink with sweetness, a slight sourness, and mint. There's was a shallow one-dimensional drink with very little mint. It also appeared that the mine was simply placed in the glass, I could see no crushing (muddling) of the leaves that release the oils for flavor.  The Cuban black bean soup was very good albeit just slightly on the salty side and the West Indies Beef patties were excellent.  I had the Jamiccan grilled chicken breast for my entree, it was suppose to have jerk seasoning on it but I couldn't taste any. The picture on the website shows 2 chicken breasts and yet my plate only had one on it. The cook who grilled did a very nice job, perfect marks and it was done perfectly, not overcooked one bit. The pineapple mango salsa was pretty  plain and needs some work. Green beans were cooked nicely but greasy. And I really enjoyed the cinnamon mashed sweet potatoes.  For a chain the food was pretty good, however very pricy imho. Would I go back, yes, for convenience, different style of food and the atmosphere.",

I will say upfront that if, by some chance, we were in the Robinson Mall area and wanted something to eat, we would probably consider visiting BB again.    We started off with a terrific server - Mike - but he had to leave in the middle of the meal.  He was attentive, warm and friendly.  He made some good recommendations (the marinated wings and goat cheese appetizers) and answered all of our questions patiently and fully.  Unfortunate, the server who replaced him - Sue - apparently thought our table of five wasn't worth the effort. if we needed anything, we had to flag her down - almost grab her - as she breezed past our table.   As I said, the wings and goat cheese/bread rounds were very good.    My wife had a fruit/chicken salad that was light, very flavorful and well-portioned.  I, on the other hand, ordered the coconut shrimp dinner and a caesar salad.  The salad was limp and tasteless.  The shrimp  coating was more bread than coconut, and the shrimp themselves were rubbery in both texture and taste.  The red rice was cold.  Chilled, almost.  The broccoli, however, was very warm but that's because it was cooked to death.  Limp as pasta; it almost fell apart in a pile of green mush when I moved it with a fork.  (Why do places overcook vegetables like this?)  So, as I said, we might stop back but only for appetizers.",

There have been many changes in bartenders the last few months and none for the better. The last two times we have been there the service has been extremely slow. Last night we sat at the bar for twenty five minutes and finally walked out and went to Red Lobster next door. The bar was not that crowded and there were two girls behind the bar.

Honestly, some of the best customer service I've received in a restaurant ever.  The jerk chicken wings are tasty...unfortunately its not spicy whatsoever. They really need to kick up the heat on them.   On two occasions, we got the Cuban Sandwich. Its large with plenty of meat. The second time we got it, the sandwich had lettuce and tomatoes on it, which we didn't like. But its really a good sandwich.  Get the Breeze salad. It has a delicious dressing...salty, sweet and sour all in one. The real star, though, is the pumpkin seeds.  The rice and beans are good, though on both occasions, they were not hot when they got to the table, just warm.  We also got the tostones, which are fried plantains with a topping. These were not too good. There's not enough topping for all of the tostones and they're dry. There's no dipping sauce or anything, either. They were kind of bland.  The price is a little higher  than average but its manageable as long as you stay away from  the pricier items.",

We also had to pay our tab right as we got our food. Slightly annoying but I can dig it. I ordered the Jamaican jerk chicken. It's actually pretty good and flavored/seasoned quite well.

My group was able to sit at a large, fun, circular table with a fit pit in the middle. It was too hot for a fire, but we enjoyed the inclusive nature of our seating that allowed for group conversation and laughter. Our group had chosen a fixed menu (chicken or fish) that was able to appeal to everyone in attendance. Veggies offered were fresh and full of taste. I am only giving three stars because I would like to say that the staff did their best to accommodate our large group - but they fell a little short by serving everyone in our group except about five people. Those five were forgotten to the point that the staff approached and asked if we were ready for boxes while our settings were clear and we were awkwardly sitting there. We had to specifically ask to be served food (despite being served drinks all night). Large groups are tough to serve, but having experienced and aware staff on hand would really make a huge difference in these settings. Luckily, their strawberry margarita was ON POINT.",

    "text": "Went here once. Was so excited because they have a beautiful patio, and a really fun atmosphere! the feel and ambiance, 10/10! however everything else is quite sub-par. The drinks, over-priced, which I expected, but the drinks themselves were not good. I got some fruity drink in a coconut (love that part!) but it was too sweet. The bartender did not know what she was doing when she made this, I could barely drink it! I am honestly not very picky when there's alcohol involved, but this was unfortunate.   The food was absolutely terrible though! Everything was frozen- I got grilled chicken and it was so rubbery! The appetizers came straight from a bag in the freezer. So as logn as your okay with a bunch of low-quality frozen food, then you'll be fine. But because the food and drinks were so sub-par, I can't see myself visiting them again, which I'm actually quite bummed about because I LOVED the music and atmosphere.",

There is free Wi Fi here in the event you need it which is always a plus for me.  My girlfriend and I both decided to have one of the seafood specials of the day. We each had wood grilled tilapia covered with almonds along with a side of sweetened mashed potatoes and broccoli. Since we got there shortly after it opened it wasn't crowded but sure got crowded by the time we left.  The food was good and for a luncheon the prices were reasonable.It is not one of my better seafood entrees but passable. There is an extensive menu and they do have during the week lunch specials which you can choose an entree with either a soup or a salad.  They do have a bar area which we didn't take advantage of.  The restaurant sits off the road near the mall of Robinson where there are other restaurants in that same off shoot. So parking can sometimes be a problem.  Please note that this restaurant is a \"chain\" so you will find it in other cities as well.",

We were a party of 6 seated outdoors and there were 2 large parties inside, but to WaIT 3 HOURS for food after ordering is unheard of!   What was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner was ruined!   2 tables of 4 ( we were 6) nearby came in after us, were served and left before our order arrived.   The Mahi bowl I ordered- 3 hours later was a soupy tasteless bowl of coconut milk!   The half off discount hardly made up for what was a sad excuse of service all around.   This location will not be visited by the 3 families in our party.  Very sad to say- but it all falls on poor management.",

I was disappointed in the flavor lapse in the food, the service was subpar, and the manager rushed us out into the cold with 48mins left until closing.

I am not a big fan of chain restaurants - I am a \"buy local\" type of guy but the food was really well done.  I purchased the firecracker shrimp and a salad (with fruit, grilled chicken, etc.. - I forget the name but it really was because of the bliss due to the mixture of chicken, cheese, fruit, dressing, etc...)  Atmosphere - at first I was worried that i walked in to a Red Hat Society meeting because the median age was 62 years old but quickly realized the folks there just know good food.    It was great  Price - the appetizers are $5-12 depending on what you get.   The entree My salad had a crazy price - $10.69 - I am not sure why it was $10.69 - I made sure to add $0.31 to the tip just so I could continue my rounding.   The prices were good but they did try to increase my math difficutly.  Food - The firecracker shrimp was just a tad over cooked but still had explosive flavor.   The salad rocked and I was able to save my calories that evening for some high octane beer in Sewickly.  I will definitely go there again.   If you have not been you are just missing out ;-)",

Not to mention the atmosphere- such a great get away from the suburbs I truly feel like I'm in the Florida keys when I am inside this restaurant. I usually get the \"coconut shrimp\" BUT I substitute it to be firecracker.... they offer the firecracker as the appetizer but let me switch it out to have a full \"meal\"'with bigger portions and with the sides as well. That's one thing I really want to stress... this restaurant is happy to make simple accommodations that other restaurants may be agitated to do.   Great drinks, appetizers, and entrees. The sizes are good and the prices are pretty average considering the location, portions, and type of food of course. I would compare this to a more tropical Red Lobster if you will.

Not a big fan of main course but appetizers are great. Having been to Jamaica, I can say that the jerk chicken here comes close to the actual authentic version. Coconut shrimps are good too. As for the main course, I always go with West Indies Chicken rice bowl. It has a mixed Caribbean and Indian flavor which appeals to me.  Make sure you get a seat outside, possibly facing the Robinson mall. That alone will add to the pleasure in a warm evening.",

The calories are listed with each menu item which is so awesome for us calorie counters!  I'm back to eating healthy and working out on a regular basis. I can definitely see myself having another healthy dinner here again especially after a good work out. This would also be a great place to grab a drink and to eat on your day off from counting calories.  I'd recommend trying the chicken tortilla soup(110 calories) and the grilled chicken and fresh fruit salad(660 calories).",

We ordered two different kinds so we could try more kinds of drinks. I thought I liked rum but that doesn't seem to be the cases. LOL. The drinks were all tasty and they all tasted differently. It was fun to try them all.  For dinner I had Shrimp & Grits. Oh My Goodness was it good!  There were a lot of shrimp, the green beans were delicious, but WOW did I like the grits!!!  They were creamy but still had texture to them. There was bacon that gave the dish a touch of saltiness, but not too salty. It also came with mushrooms but I'm not fungi friendly so I asked to leave them off. It was a great dish and I had a happy tummy.  My husband had the Seafood Paella. It was loaded with seafood such as mussels, scallops, and fish. It had a nice flavor and seasoning. The rice was cooked perfectly. It was a great dish.  We enjoyed our whole experience-including our service. We will definitely won't wait too long to go back.",

We brought both our biological children and also our foster children here. It's a \"Welcome to the Family\" celebration! We start off with the hummus appetizer which our 5 year old son is a big fan of. (Update: no longer on the menu) We also love their house salads with the cucumber sliver slices, pumpkin seeds, and crisp, tasty dressing! I ALWAYS get the paella which is AMAZEBALLS! Though I make it myself at home, theirs is way better! My husband always gets the Buttermilk Fried Chicken. We are creatures of habit and when you find something as delicious as these two menu items, you gotta stick with it!  We used to LOVE their coffee as it was Jamaican Blue Mountain; but they switched a while ago, and it's just not the same. Kinda my one let down now. Their frozen and tropical drinks are delicious, and we can never agree on just one dessert so we always order 2 or more. This time we got Chocolate Island (our go-to favorite) and a never-before tried Warm Chocolate Pineapple Upside-Down Cake. Both lived up to expectations!  If you go on a weekend in the summer, they may have a band playing outside. Fingers crossed!  For a chain restaurant, this is one of the better ones! Darden owns your classic Olive Gardens and Red Lobsters which are good for chains, but they hit it out of the park with this concept! We are partial to Jamaican themed anything though as we honeymooned in Montego Bay.",

We arrived 15 minutes prior to our reservation time, cake in hand. They had not reserved any tables for us because they just didn't have room, and then said we would have to wait for others to finish. This completely defeats the purpose of a RESERVATION. But the worst was yet to come. The general manager lied to us repeatedly... first she told us that a party table in the back had paid and were finishing their desserts. We watched as their first round of desserts were delivered 15 minutes later. Apparently at some point she told the party table that another party was waiting and they would need to leave soon. I would have been insulted if they had said this to me while I was enjoying my dinner, just to cover up for their incompetence. She even stationed servers near their table to put pressure on them to leave (she admitted this to us... wow). Later, another 9-person party table opened up, but we watched for 20 minutes as it remained dirty. We asked the manager if we could just sit there (we had been waiting for our RESERVED table for over an hour at this point), and she told us that she heard from somebody we didn't want to sit there. Another lie. The table remained unclean. She wouldn't even look us in the eye unless we went up to her first and her tone was overly rude all night. Finally an hour and a half later we were seated and given one free appetizer. Hooray. The waitress was great. If you make reservations here, don't expect them follow through.",

When you walk into Bahama Breeze, I can honestly say you will not feel like you are soaking up sun on the beaches of the Bahamas but I can say you will feel like you are in a large wooden building with slightly depressed servers all the while wondering why the ceiling fan is on in the middle of a 20 degree day in January to which you would later conclude that it's reasoning is to uphold the latter part of the establisments name. (That was a long sentence...pheww)  Well moving on, the food was pretty snazzy, I recommend the spinach dip since it was like giving your tongue a full massage. The beer was pretty normal..nothing special. I will say since there was no one there, I was asked if I was okay about 5 times..and that my friends is a new record.

    "text": "This place is actually surprisingly delicious and may be one of my new favorite chains in Pittsburgh.  ****  We were craving a huge meal after a long day of Outlet Shopping before the holidays and we decided on Red Lobster. It's hard to beat those cheesy puffs things. I can hit a whole basketful easily in one sitting.  Apparently half of Pittsburgh was craving those same puffs. There was a waitlist for up to an hour. The T family never waits for food - so we decided to go to Bahama Breeze.  We grabbed a takeout menu and scanned it quickly. The prices seemed right as did the selection. We went for it.   And I can easily say that Bahamaa Breeze brought it. I was extremely satisfied with my almond coated tilapia fish dish, paired with garlic mashed potatotes, and thin green beans. The fish was fresh and buttery - and I almost felt like I was back in SF for a moment - the flavor was so distinct and delicious.  The rest of our party - was just as happy with their meal choices - finding the portions huge, and the quality and flavor - robust.  I have to dock a star though for the creme caramel cheescake, which I expected to be a stand-out. Especially since it was touted as being a Bahama Breeze special. It was grossly disappointing for it's off taste - and pricey for six dollars. I found myself doing something - which i NEVER do at a table.   I let everybody else finish it, while I just watched.   But sometimes - you just can't have it all - and I'd like to think that Bahama Breeze is capable of whipping up a quality desert - and I just happened to order the wrong one.",

I've been here with a lot of former Disney cast members like myself, and we've all agreed that the way the staff here handles its customers is admirably similar to the Disney standard.

    "text": "At a loss for a new place to explore and write about, Kay and I journeyed to the chain restaurant stronghold of Robinson the other night for the dining choices in this suburban kingdom are multitudinous.   If I was to eat at a chain on this evening (and I do so often and somewhat willingly), it was going to be a place that offers the kind of food we don't get much of in Western PA.   The decor is as kitschy as a B-52's gig. Giant straw canopies hang from the ceiling. The pillars appear to be made from trees. None of the help looks or sounds as if they hail from the Carribean, but it is likely that some of them spent or will spend a Spring Break there. Billy Ocean didn't drop in. Ben Zephaniah probably wouldn't like the place. Jimmy Buffet might own stock in the franchise.  Authentic or not though (and I certainly have my doubts), Bahama Breeze lived up to its namesake in that the food was just easy to like.  Our opener was a serving of the Crab Claws St. Thomas.  Blue crab is used, the generous amount of tiny claws swimming in a snappy \"Island Citrus Butter\". A loaf of pillowy \"Cuban Bread\" comes to the table in a bag (to keep it fresh) for the purposes of soaking up that wonderful butter. The crab claws were fun to eat and required no hardware or labor. You just put them in your mouth and pull that dainty meat off with your teeth. If there were 100 of them, we would have finished them all with extreme prejudice.   I so wanted to try Jerk Chicken, but at Bahama Breeze it's served with pasta, which seems so...touristy? Is that the right word?  Note #1-One really cool thing Bahama Breeze does is offer a \"lighter portion\" of many of their dishes, a godsend for those on a diet or on a budget as you get less food and pay a little less. That little perk almost made me order the Jerk Chicken Pasta as well as a few of their other entrees.  Being True to my blue-collar, sandwich-loving, Friday-state-of-mind self, I instead ordered a Cuban since I really wanted to try a good one, not a Panera-grade one (see my reviews archive).   Lo and behold, it's a dandy and flattened oven-baked Italian hoagie with Swiss cheese in lieu of Provolone, \"Cuban\" bread in lieu of Italian, pork, and more familiar components in tomato, lettuce, and mayonnaise. No pickle or mustard was to be found, however. Not that I minded as this was one hearty yet tidy and planar hero, artfully sliced in half on a bias.   Note #2-Another cool thing about Bahama Breeze is their choice of sides. In the case of sandwiches, the choices include mere french fries, a tomato salad, yellow rice with black beans, and my pick; the brisk, fresh, palate-restoring fruit salad. Grapes danced with pineapple chunks in a ramekin as a small scoop of orange sherbet oversaw the affair.   Kay's Chicken with Cilantro Crema was good enough, but the mashed potatoes that accompanied it were a symphony of spud, roasted corn, and a trio of cheeses.   For dessert, we traded off on the Chocolate Island and the Bananas Supreme. Once again, cultural cred is in question, but the flavors were undeniable. I preferred the mousse/brownie silo that is the Island and the sea of chocolate sauce and vanilla bean anglaise that surrounded it. The Bananas Supreme is Bananas Foster collaborating with that school fundraiser classic, Banana Nutbread. It's warm, there's butterscoth, brandy, and vanilla ice cream involved; it's an effortless winner.   Being that this Bahama Breeze is the only one of its kind in this side of the state, it's easy to forget that you're dealing with a chain here. The quality food only helps to further that end.   And now...Bad Brains...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DN2KePzKdYO8%26feature%3Drelated&s=e77df93abdf2e1b9d7d2924d08faf8130d524cd564d314da13441a0605b3d9e5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=N2Ke...</a>",

    "text": "I love the Breeze, I'm a huge fan of really good black bean soup, no one does it better than the Breeze. They're version is low in fat, vegan, and pretty high in sodium, but so is most restaurant food. A bowl makes a great lite lunch and is rather filling.  NOTE* the rest of this review goes back to my pre vegan days.  The Breeze has the best shrimp 'n grits this side of New Orleans, I've had shrimp n grits in Bay St Louis, New Orleans, and Shreveport, and you just can't beat the fresh shrimp caught right out of the ocean, but Bahama Breeze makes up for it with tons of cheddar in the grits, lots of butter and cream too. The shrimp are good, not rubbery, they use 21-30 count shrimp and you get quite a bit. The creamy grits, the succulent shrimp, and the spicy coating on the shrimp is like a party in your mouth, it's not always available, the four times I had it, they were part of the nightly specials.  When I stopped here for lunch I'd always get a Cuban sandwich. They are big in Florida, it's hard to find them here. Delicious garlic roasted pork, salty ham, creamy swiss cheese, tart dill pickles, spicy brown mustard, all toasted on a pressed cuban loaf. Does that make your mouth water? It does mine! Wash this beauty down with a red ale or pale ale and you'll be thanking me for the rest of your life.  Bahama Breeze is one of the better restaurants from the Dardan Restaurant group.",

We were both very impressed by how fresh and light his swordfish was....literally melted in your mouth! And....coconut shrimp is my absolute favorite and I felt that the shrimp was cooked just right and not at all rubbery.  The service was okay but the atmosphere was very peaceful and for a second made us think we were back home in Florida! I would definitely go back.

We started with the baked goat cheese appetizer stuffed into bell peppers with crostini. Unbelievable! I had the Chicken Santiago which was also very good and my colleague had the almond-crusted mahi mahi special with mashed sweet potatoes. Very fresh and perfectly cooked.

In all seriousness, I felt as though I was eating on a cruise ship overlooking the ocean. It was a different and awesome experience.  Both the food and service were great! I received a coupon in the mail and decided to take a chance. My waitress was very friendly and knew her stuff. I told her what kind of things I liked and she was able to recommend the Seafood Paella (assorted seafood, chicken, sausage and peas with yellow rice). Usually the first bite tells you how the rest of the meal will go. Immediately, I could tell how fresh my dish was and because of that, it made the meal even more amazing. Although Bahama Breeze was a bit pricey, it was well worth it!",

The dining areas were clean and decorations were nice. I ordered the Seafood Paella, two shared the Shrimp Linguine, and one other ordered the Fish Tacos. The food seemed like it took an unreasonable amount of time to get to our table despite the restaurant being almost empty of customers. We watched as the shrimp tacos sat under the food warmer for at least 15 minutes before being brought to us. The linguine tasted like it had too much of an Italian type seasoning on it. The Paella had hardly any flavor. The shrimp and scallops were plain. The chicken was okay along with the fish. The muscles were muscles. Can't go wrong there. I may have just been expecting a more flavorful dish for the price we were paying. I'm never a person to complain but it seemed that there was much room for improvement. I would return to give another chance.",

During that time, I used to frequent this restaurant on a fairly regular basis and really enjoyed the food and carribean theme. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Pittsburg still had the location open and was eager to give it a try.  We ordered Skillet Simmered Jerk Shrimp for an appetizer. It was spicy and delicious. The sauce and warm bread that it is served with is amazing. For our entrees, we had Baby Back Ribs and the Coconut Shrimp dinner. My husband loves the ribs! The meat was falling off the bone and he felt like they were some of the best ribs that he's ever had. He would definitely order these again. I had the coconut shrimp meal. I was really skeptical about ordering the coconut shrimp, but went ahead and gave it a try. I'm glad that I did because it was phenomenal. It wasn't overly sweet like others places serve their coconut shrimp. The only down side was that the rice was extremely dry and hardened. We ordered a cocktail too. They have a very large variety from which to choose.   Service was good. Can't wait to visit again!",

I've tried making the recipe myself using recipes found online and nothing ever compares to theirs. If you've never tried it I highly recommend you give it a try. The chicken is cooked perfectly, the sauce is the perfect amount of spice, and the asparagus and mushrooms are a great addition to the dish.  On top of that this place has delicious drinks. This time around we went with the jalapeno watermelon margaritas and it was so good that we ordered a second pitcher. The ambience of this restaurant is always delightful as well.

The jerk chicken not so much.  It was very bland, too bland to be Jamaican jerk chicken. The included on the side BBQ sauce, even just a little, completely dominated the chicken.  So if you want flavor, probably try a different dish. I'm trying a burger next time!",

First off I had to keep convincing myself that our server wasn't the least competent person on planet earth, he kept proving me wrong. The food was mushy and lacking of quality you would expect at a place like this. The manager did stop by to pick up the slack of her waitstaff to refill my drink. The only positive was the appetizer. Shame I'll never get back the dollars spent here.",

    "text": "Here we go again!  First impressions last a lifetime. Upon entering I was told my party of 3 would have a 15 to 20 minute wait time. One third of the tables were empty and there were employees everywhere standing around doing nothing. I am not a fan of open kitchens, i watched several employees  goofing around, pushing and shoving in the food prep and line area. I went to use the rest room during my wait. Filthy and unkempt,  this is typically a bad sign in any restaurant, they definitely do not have a daily cleaning regime. After being seated at a dirty table I had look at menu, very predictable.  No thank you. Our waitress had an afro the size of a beach ball, I thought we had health codes regarding hair in food service industries in Pennsylvania. I guess they wanted me to feel like I was in the Bahamas. I don't like eating human hair, I opted just to have a cup of coffee, acceptable at best. My wife got some seafood dish that resembled a bad idea. My daughter got pre packaged frozen chicken and stale tasting frozen fries. Well once again I am focusing on the bad, but when you are slapped in the face with it, you get my point. This place is nothing more than fast food. I just can't figure out how the bar got lowered so low. It's just embarrassing.  I am always expected to give my best performance at my job, no less. Why have we become so accepting of pre packaged, mediocre, lack luster, lazy, dirty and ect. These chain restaurants are disgraceful and when the ownership and their staff don't get it right the first time, I will not ever be back. Thanks for your time.",

They have a lot of types of drinks and I was glad they also had not alcohol drinks. BTY I recommend their Virgin Pina Colada. I enjoyed sitting outside since the weather was good, I felt I was near to the Ocean or in the West (lol!!) because of the decoration and the latino music. I just thought the meal took so long for coming so I recommend you order some tapas or little bites.",

And Now this location when my other flight crew showed up tipsy, embarrassed us by telling the bartender \"Just surprise me with any drink, but make it dark like my soul!\" (Then later SPILLED a drink all over the bar!) Anyway I throughly enjoyed the pinot with a \"light\" sized Mahi/Shrimp rice bowl and it was so friggin delicious. Lots of veggies, fresh and affordable. All ingredients for a four star+ review!",

Personally I found the chicken quesadilla a bit dry. However, the jackfruit tacos were mind blowing and very unique. They came with a side dish, so we chose the black bean soup which was better than most I've tasted elsewhere. Their drinks menu was also really impressive - I want to come back here to try the margarita flight, which includes a hibiscus margarita and tamarind margarita.   Service: Our server was Earl, and he was very attentive, polite, and helpful. We were pleasantly surprised with the service we received, even during peak weekend hours.",

The perfect size and taste for an evening of dinning.    I would come back again and again. The jerk chicken is legit, even if it's not from Jamaica.   Have you tried the plantains? Yes please!

We got our drinks after several minutes no water no setups, and one appetizer only. The price for a 9 oz pour of Kendall Jackson chardonnay was $14.79. even in Pennsylvania that is more than the cost of the bottle at the wine and spirits store. The happy hour here used to be much much better, but apparently corporate greed has taken over. We have been coming here for at least 10 years and had many happy hours here. We expressed our concerns to several of the employees this evening about these issues, but no one took it to the attention of any manager. We will not be returning!!!",

The jerk chicken was grilled to perfection.  Very moist and flavorful while avoiding being under cooked.  This restaurant, also, has great appetizers.  My favorites include the skillet simmered jerk shrimp, chicken wings, coconut shrimp, and beef empanadas.  If you can visit during happy hour when appetizers are half priced, I strongly encourage you to do so.  This place has great food and a tremendously friendly environment.  The staff is very helpful.  Another dish that is great for seafood lover's is the seafood paella.  No matter what you hunger is, Bahama Breeze has numerous selections that can satisfy your appetite.  Don't hesitate to drop by.",

My boyfriend had the burger and we were surprised at how small it was.. it was the size of a children's burger.   My boyfriend liked the burger and I even had a bite - it was good but for the price.. we would have preferred it be a regular size burger at least.   Hopefully this is  one time thing.. we will be returning and hopefully the burger will be a little better.   Thanks Bahama Breeze .  ..",

The person who brought the app brought silver and said \"let me go look for plates.\". Seriously...look for plates.  Should we have brought our own?  Anyway, ate the app without plates after waiting for 7 minutes for those lost plates and both of us made a mess on our shirts.  Told the waitress and her excuse was...I have another party.  How the hell is that my problem?  So...funny.  I have ordered 2 beers since sitting down and she has yet to pick up the bottle I brought from the bar.  I must have cooties.  The food was average at best.  The rice and beans were soupy, the guacamole had 2 very pretty shades of green, pretty but probably not fresh.  Both dinners were cold but we were hungry.  Probably won't be back.  When you have poor service and lousy meals sure does not make it worth it.",

We're first time here and found out they have happy hours 50% off on liquors and appetizers. Nobody taking care of us after we'd been setting at the table for 10mins. Finally a waiter named Gregory came to us explained and apologized for the wait. He also got us the 50% off appetizer (the wings) after happy hour. It's nicely handled. Despite the wait, the foods are great. We ordered the seafood paella, Jamaica chicken wings, and the BBQ ribs.   The wings are really good, highly recommended! The paella has many ingredients in it; the size is quite large, good for parties of 2-3. The BBQ ribs are juicy and savory. We're glad that we did go to Olive Garden.",

For dinner I had the shrimp and mahi with lemongrass sauce bowl. The flavors were well blended, yet individual enough to stand alone. My boyfriend got the Caribbean style lobster mac & cheese. He enjoyed it but thought the battered and fried lobster was an unforgivable culinary crime, as it did not match the \"lightly fried\" description he anticipated. The rum cake (with ice cream) was a fair compromise for groups that include individuals that might not want coconut or key like flavored dessert.",

I went with a group of coworkers and we all raved about our specialty drinks and dinner platters. There were endless options which made it difficult, but we were all happy with what we ordered.   I ordered salmon and it was cooked to perfection. It was everything I was hoping it would be. My one coworker is a vegetarian and she forgot to ask for no bacon in her platter. When it came out and had bacon all in it, we mentioned it to our sever, but she didn't bat an eye even though it wasn't her mistake. She took the plate back to the kitchen right away and made sure it was cooked properly.   The restaurant had a really fun, festive vibe inside and like I said, our server was amazing. She was very attentive and seemed to really enjoy her job. Her name was Kayla.  Bahama Breeze is definitely a new favorite for me and I can't wait to go back.",

They made a mistake with my husband's order so that he had to wait even longer for his. When the waiter brought out everyone else's meal, she also brought out the combo appetizer platter, which we had already ordered, received and eaten as our appetizer because apparently they made an extra one and so she was somehow bestowing this gift upon us free of charge...none of us wanted any more of that bc our main meals were now in front of us.  To top it off, when she placed this gratuitous appetizer platter on our table, the accompanying sauce spilled in my husband's lap.  The food quality is marginal at best.  Oh, and on our way inside, we witnessed a kitchen employee sitting outside in front of the restaurant on the curb smoking a cigarette.  Yuck.  Never going back to this place.",

We ordered the shrimp and lobster quesadilla which was solid along with the sampler. The wings were tasty and had good heat, the coconut shrimp were good along with the conch. She ordered Mahi Mahi special and loved it. I had the steak Oscar. Steak was cooked to order and crab was decent.   For our drinks I ordered the red lager and she had a coconut mojito. The beer was good and not overpowering but the mojito was solid. We didn't opt for desert after all we tasted but can't wait to return.",

This is the only Bahama Breeze in Pittsburgh (I believe the next closest one is in King of Prussia) so it doesn't feel like a chain to me. My favorite drink is the Yaka Hula Hickey Dula featuring rum, Reisling and pineapple juice. So good! I recently tried the Skillet-Simmered Jerk Shrimp which was AMAZING! The shrimp is served in a mini skillet in a wonderful juice blend of thyme, garlic, and veggies with a mini loaf of Cuban bread to dip into the skillet juice. This is one of the best dishes I ever had!  You can either eat indoors or outdoors. On a beautiful day, I definitely choose the outdoors. The only thing that would make the scenery ideal is a real ocean breeze and ocean to hear and overlook as you dine.",

Bahama Breeze, in Robinson Town Center, is one of my favorite places to stop on the way to or from Pittsburgh International Airport.  On a crowded night the spacious covered wrap around porch or indoor bar make for comfortable places to sip a colada, Mojito, or 'tini while waiting for your pager to summon you to dinner.  Harry Belafonte tunes like \"Man Smart (Women Smarter)\"  and other steel drum laden favorites set the tone for fun as you stroll up to the porch entry.  Inside, the vibrant Caribbean themed decor has an authentic, 'upscale' flare (without being over done nor 'cheesy') that helps you forget you are in Pittsburgh for the hour or so you are there.  The generally laid back, open/airy atmosphere, and spacious seating arrangements make this a decent place to dine with children as well.  Having been there on several occasions, I find the staff to be consistently upbeat (regardless of how hectic it gets), attentive, and well versed on the menu.  My personal favorites: Sun-Drenched Portobello & Vegetable Sandwich (grilled seasonal veggies, tomato, crisp asparagus, pepper-jack cheese in hot-pressed on Cuban bread), Bahamarita, and their homemade Key Lime pie.",

While I get that it is nice for the food to be there fast, there is NO WAY that it was an order dropped for us, it had to have been a send back or misring as there is no way they could ring the order, fry them, plate them, and run them. The result was the shrimp, which actually tasted ok, were cool from waiting for us to order them.  As for the entrees: the mahi mahi tacos were boring, made with store bought and stale tortillas, and relied on too much crappy salad for the small sliver of fish. The cuban sandwich was even worse, the meat was dry and rubbery.  The coconut shrimp were okay though and would have been good if they were hot, and the tomato salad was tasty. Everything else was just crap.",

Coconut shrimp tacos were actually quite good - a nice combination of sweet coconut shrimp and a tangy sauce with jicama slaw.

We even call it the \"vacation restaurant.\"   However my visit on Saturday Jan 2, did not live up to our expectations.  It was busy and they were backed up, which was understandable as apparently the entire population of the city decided they needed to shop that day.  But once we were finally seated, the experience did not really improve.  The servers seemed to have no sense of urgency or hustle. Drinks weren't refilled promptly, or at all.  Appetizer was delivered literally 5 seconds before the entrees. I hate that, and mentioned it to the people that brought the food, they just said \"sorry and ran away. My actual server was conspicuously absent for most of the meal after that,  No one followed up,  I could see people stacked up in the waiting area, but for most of the meal there were empty tables around us. So either the servers couldn't handle a full house or the kitchen was fouled up.  Either way, the staff I interacted with did not seem to see or care about the problems I saw.   Both adults ordered soup, one bowl was delivered before the entree, another was delivered with the entree. No reason was given, apparently that is a decision that is not made by the patron. I had the black bean soup and fish tacos. The tacos seemed bland, like someone forgot the spice. Really, it was just a hunk of whitefish over coleslaw in a tortilla. The black bean soup was mostly broth, with very little beans.    So I don't know if they were just having a bad day, or if the place is just not as good as it used to be. Disappointing, really.  Wasted someone's holiday gift card that wouldn't normally be able to afford to go there on there own income. That's what really makes me mad.",

They have changed some of the recipes, and removed the Carribean element to many of their dishes. The flatbreads have become bland pizzas, for example, and several of the seafood dishes have had their fruity sauces replaced with garlic butter generic sauce. The fire pit was also closed down, according to our waiter, and so they do not fire sear their foods anymore. I guess it just broiled.  With those changes, there's nothing special to it anymore and I have not been a customer since. If they reverse those changes i may consider going back and giving a better rating.",

My one complaint would be that they seem to change their menu a lot which can be disappointing when you go craving a certain meal only to find that it's gone, but there's always great new food to try so I guess it all evens out. I've definitely never been disappointed trying new things there.",

So they placed another order and it took about 10-15 to come out and it had Avocados in it. On the menu the dish didn't state it Come with avocado. The second manager didn't apologize nor gave me a discount on my drink . This was my first time here and had an horrible experience. She acted as if messing up people orders twice is normal . I guess it's a Pittsburgh thing. Can't wait to go back to Texas.",

Becoming frustrated at this point we again started to browse the menu, only to be told...\" Let me go double check what we do still have\".  At this point we were beyond irritated and asked for our check. The bartender brought it over to us in the amount of $6.66. Now I am surely NOT going to heaven.",

    "text": "This chain is part of the Darden Group (Olive Garden, Red Lobster, etc)  Pros:  Great Food (the last 2 times for both my husband and myself)            Atmosphere is very nice and different from the usual PGH fare.            There's a really nice patio/outdoor dining deck that's nice             (depending on the weather), if you can pick up the whole restaurant and plop it down on a beach, it would look totally @ home!    Cons:  Pricey (as most large chains tend to be)             Wait staff is inconsistent.  First Visit:  Fabulous!  Food was great and our server was sooo good that we earned him a \"Pineapple\"!  (which I will explain later)  Second Visit (7/19/10):  Food was great, service was absolutely awful! We sat outside, which is \"seat yourself\" and  A.)  it was quite a while before we were acknowledged and drink orders taken. B.)  we were clearly not our waitress'  priority. The food runner ran all of our food and my husband was in need of another drink after the appetizer which went completely un-noticed the duration of the meal.  We looked and looked for ANYone to grab a refill and it was a ghost town on the patio other than the other patrons.  PINEAPPLES:  If you have a great experience with the server assigned to you, if you ask to speak with a manager to tell him/her how awesome your server was, the server \"earns a pineapple\" for the guest compliment to their service. Its a nice thing to do to show how much you appreciate it when someone does treat you right all night!   :)",

    "text": "Bad and overpriced.   Wanted to like this place, convenient location, nice patio outside on a Spring evening, but no. We ordered steak entrees, Oscar and Sirloin, neither was cooked correctly Carly.  Medium fully well done, medium rare was cold and bloody.  Asking for assistance from the waiter got no better results.  We were hungry so we ended up trying to eat what we had but they were so grizzly and tough we gave up.  The fish tacos literally needed to be held up and drained, pouring off some liquid ( wet lettuce?) ruining the crunch a taco should have.  Mashed potatoes were only potatoes side choice, white or sweet.  They had skins on, white mashed potatoes and were not washed!  Periodically, you could feel the crunch of sand/ dirt from potatoes not well scrubbed before cooking.  Yuk!  Ordered wings and quesadilla appetizers early, knowing the other two in my party would arrive hungry.  Waiter discussed hot or mild wings.  He brought onion rings instead and quickly dropped them off and left.  We ate the quesadilla, caught him later to correct and he said I said \"rings\". I said No and reminded him, \" spicy or mild?\" And he said Oh yeah. The weird thing is that he reached to take the rings away.  Usually, they say sorry Ill bring you the correct item, and offer you the other, since it cannot go to anyone else.  We may have eaten a few if he had, given how hungry everyone was, if he had. But no, and it was so late by then we cancelled the wings.  This whole fiasco was $75! $90 with tip.  Will never return, neither should you.",

    "text": "My parents love Bahama Breeze so if I go out to dinner with them this is usually where we end up. I'm not big on chain restaurants but this one gets my seal of approval! We always do the call ahead seating which is great because usually the wait is 45+ minutes around dinnertime on a weekend night.  My mother has a shellfish allergy so when with them we usually start off with the chicken tostones-very similar to nachos except instead of chips, it's fried plantains. Very tasty! When not dining with my parents, I like to start with one of the shrimp apps. Personally, the coconut shrimp is my favorite (and I'm not a fan of coconut except on shrimp). I also like the skillet simmered shrimp which comes with bread to sop up the juices. The firecracker shrimp comes with a spicy red pepper sauce and is good as well. For entrees, I almost always order the wood-grilled tilapia off of the fresh fish menu, mango glazed with grilled pineapple salsa. It's delicious! My parents usually do the same style but with salmon. Also the key west fish tacos are a good  choice. As for drinks, I always,always order a frozen bahamarita (tequila, and kiwi,strawberry,and mango ices). My favorite reason for coming here,believe it or not, is for dessert. I LOVE,LOVE,LOVE the chocolate island and I would seriously come here for just that!  It's rich chocolate mousse on a fudge brownie Island in milk chocolate sauce and vanilla bean anglaise. It is hands down the best dessert I have ever had in a chain restaurant.",

Not sure if they are really keeping up with the times but I ordered what I did the last time I was at a BH.  The service should set the tone but seeing that it was the pre-dinner hour I was totally ignored once my order was put in.  The waitress was preoccupied with the table with employees on break than she was serving the bar.  I was not offered a water while I waited and was only told have a nice day after she gave me the order.  She did not check it for accuracy nor ask me if I needed anything else which I did in the measly amount of salad dressing that came with the order.  Suffice it say the salad was a tad brown on the edges so I ended up throwing most it out less the tomatoes and sliced cucumber.  Anyway, the wings were my favorite back in the day but they definitely lacked any flavor.  To sum it up I would say this was a big thumbs down, sad because I really wanted to come back again before I left.",

Well, at least it was last night, so I headed on over to Robinson Town Center Mall,  or whatever it is called.    Not so big on suburban chain places but I was starving.  Compared to where my hotel is, Robinson was the \"big city\".  For what it was - suburban chain place  - I give it 5 stars.  Had the Pan seared tilapia with rice and green beans. I enjoyed it. Felt pretty healthy too!  After I spend some more time in Pittsburgh I'm sure I will laugh at the night I ate in the 'burbs because I was too scared of the highways to drive to a trendier neighborhood.  But I will always be grateful that this place was accessible and open 'til 11 pm last night.  I don't think I could have handled another dinner of Fritos from the hotel's convenience shop!  P.S. The last time I ate at a Bahama Breeze was when I lived in Orlando.  Bahama Breeze was like going to Disney to dine without having to drive the extra 30 miles.  This was a nice little reminder of what it's like to \"feel\" the Florida.  Sigh... why did I move away from there again?",

    "text": "3 stars because it was comical that our server had the personality of an awkward boy going through puberty. I got the Jamaican jerk sandwhich which was fantastic. We also got the flight of rum and margaritas which was pretty cool  but when I asked the youngest brother from home improvement on what drinks were good he looked like I was asking him if I could kiss him mom confused and a little grossed out. Regardless it was ok I would try it again. Jerk food was good jerk kid serving was not.",

I mean completely raw and just sauteed. They comped the meal and gave a free dessert, but I'm pretty sure they messed up the check , either way I'll never be here again. Shame, I like the vacation atmosphere",

Our waitress, Annie, was very kind but said they are very short staffed in the kitchen. We gobbled most of the meal due to a flight at 7:30p and boxed the rest. Notified the manager of our displeasure. Will not return. Then! I was notified by open Table that they cancelled my reservation at 5:30pm! This is not right.",
