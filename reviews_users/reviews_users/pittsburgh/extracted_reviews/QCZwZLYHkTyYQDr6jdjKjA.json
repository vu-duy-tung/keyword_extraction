Also, the toppings were not greatly blended, just rather sprinkled. DIdn't even enjoy the pizza crust. I work right next door, but wont go there again. I usually dont write reviews. Was surprised Yelp had 4 stars and I was disaoopinted, so writing my experience.So sharing my input that may help others make an uinformed choice causeI think 4 stars is misleading.",

    "text": "Lived in a number of neighborhoods in Pittsburgh and finding that locations best pizza is always a challenge.  I have followed friends advice, magazine reviews, etc., etc. with mixed success.  Having moved to Stanton Hts. I was at a loss, but driving around Bloomfield, the first one to catch my eye was Graziano's. A great mix of locals, students and employees from Children's Hospital.  The pizza was great.  Somewhat thin crust, baked bubbly and crispy around the edges, can use more sauce but the mix of cheeses quickly remedies that shortage.  Toppings are great.  Makes a great breakfast the next day outta the fridge!! The beer selection is admirable.  The service varies depending on who is at the counter. Since discovering Graziano's I have been up and down Liberty Avenue in Bloomfield and always return to Graziano's.  The only other place to get my business would be Aiello's in Squirrel Hill.",

    "text": "Graziano's is one of those places that you could walk right past and not even notice it.  Rumor has it that Graziano's are related to the people that own Angelo's Pizzeria on Liberty Avenue in Bloomfield.  They got into a fight, and Graziano's was born.  Who knows if this is actually True, but they *do* have very similar pizza:  on the thin side, crunchy and chewy, with a great mix of cheeses on top.  They sell beer (bring your own paper bag-LOL) and from time to time there are some neighborhood cronies in there that look like they've helped themselves a bit to the 40's in the cooler.  But since it's strictly a pick up your pizza and get outta there place, it's more comical than scary.  I have the good fortune of living about 2 blocks away, but it is a bit strange that they don't deliver.  But it's worth swinging by and picking up a pie.",

A little greasy, but once that's wiped away and a little parm is sprinkled on top, the pizza veers towards excellence.  $12 and change for the large pie.  They also sell 40's and 6-packs of beer, ranging from PBR to Victory and Bell's for somewhat decent prices, around $9 per 6-pack.  You can also pick up some Boone's Farm, which I only mention for the sheer hilarity.  While I'm happy to take-out from here, I'd probably end up dropping a star if I ever stayed inside for longer than 5 minutes--it's fairly filthy.  However, the staff is nice and it never takes longer than 20 minutes for a take-out order to be ready.",

On one occasion, I ordered my favorite wings, they told me 20 minutes, so I arrived which was around 22min-25. As I was walking in the door, this very chubby with bright blue eye shadow girl, starts barking \"when is this girl with the wings coming to get her order, it's been here forever.\" I stood by the counter, and said ,\" This girl is here.\" on another occasion, I ordered 6 pies, and the cashier at the counter (with the same bright eye shadow girl standing behind her)  hands me 3 plates. For 6 large pies. I asked her, can I get a few more plates and napkins. I have a big party and this is 6 pies. My niece was there, and she blurted, we need like a lot, there least 50 of us. I say a nice stack or 20 plates I would of been happy. not 3.  The cashier (curly brown hair - short) , goes with major attitude ,\" You need more?!\" then rolls her eyes. Pains me to say, I do not think I will take my staff or myself to this place anymore. I truly love the food and the owner. But the girls that work there are awful. 4 stars for food, 1 for customer service. Which as you see, is why I gave 3 stars.",

    "text": "I was in Pittsburgh since yesterday from out of town on business. Tonight was the conclusion a long day and all I wanted was to go back to my hosteI and maybe grab a bite to eat. In my haste to get dinner before I passed out, I almost made the mistake of entering Fazio's, the other hole-in-the-wall pizza joint on Penn Avenue in Lawrenceville. Well-I am glad I did not do that!  Remembering that the restaurant I quickly Yelped before walking out from the hostel had a longer name, I continued to walk down Penn Avenue until I found Graziano's. Upon entering, I was greeted by a slightly unwelcoming smell. It wasn't pizza I was smelling, or at least fresh pizza. But I remembered how positive all the reviews on Yelp were. I was a little disappointed when I saw how small their menu was, and yet it still took me a while to order. I first contemplated getting the fried fish with french fries. I do love a crispy fish sandwich. There was even a girl at another table who had just gotten hers for eating there. I tried to inconspicuously spy her fried fish. It looked good but it's a who lot a fish. I decided to order the steak and cheese sub instead. Now that I am home eating, I am glad I went to Graziano's and I am very impressed with their steak sub. Meaty, greasy, tangy, and large. What more can I say? That's a good steak sub. The bread is slightly toasted but still soft. Just perfect. I don't know many places that put Italian dressing and mayo on steak and cheeses, but I like the combo. It's more than enough food for 2 and only costed 9 bucks. I think I will finish it all off because I did not eat lunch today. MMM. stiill got lots more to enjoy. I recommend Graziano's for take out, not eating in. There are tables and chairs, but as I mentioned...the smell is a little off-putting. like the inside of an old dish cloth.  If they could fix that, they would be golden.",

When it comes down to it I rate take-out and delivery places mostly based on food taste because I am not going elsewhere for superior service and inferior food, so Graziano's gets 5 stars by my standards. I have friends who visit from out of town who order it to take home. It's that good. Don't be fooled by the single slices though, as it seems they use a different recipe for them (they kinda suck). Go for the large plain or extra cheese. Perfecta!",

    "text": "I stopped by Graziano's last night for some pizza with a friend.  She had suggested that we eat there because she had heard that they had some good pizza.  The outside of the place doesn't have the appearance but is consistent with all of the buildings on the block.  Once you are inside though the place is pretty clean.  There are probably around 10 tables in the dining room portion of the restaurant with a single flat screen hung in one corner so that you can watch as you eat.  Just past the dining room and on the way to the register were about 6 beer coolers filled with everything from your normal adjunct lagers to Four Loko and even some more expensive 22 oz Dog Fish Head bottles.  As a beer lover who normally doesn't drink adjunct lagers if I can help it, I was really impressed with their selection.  As a matter of a fact in the hour or so that we were there, I actually saw more people get beer to go than order their food.  For our dinner we decided to get a large pizza with chicken on it.  It came out piping hot and I was surprised at how large it actually was.  What I was not as big of a fan of was the amount of grease that was still on the pizza but I understand that is what happens with cooked cheese  As with most pizzas, there are the three major components to them cheese, sauce and crust.  The crust was definitely the standout of this pie as it was crispy while not being too think.  The sauce was merely average as I did not really notice any spices in it or anything to distinguish it from anything else.  Finally the cheese was decent, there was a lot of it, and I enjoyed the garlic flavoring that was with the cheese.  Overall it wasn't the best pizza in the world but I enjoyed eating it and it got the job done.  The bottom line for me is that I may head back here in the future.  The price is definitely right and the food was decent enough but where they really shine is their beer selection.",

    "text": "After visiting Graziano's it's clear why they sell so much booze. You have to be totally plastered in order to find the food edible. The pizza looks like an Exon-Valdez reenactment (enough oil and grease to lube your Hummer) and the sandwiches are just gross. If it wasn't for their location, this place would have been turned into a liquor store decades ago. Avoid at all costs.",

Tried a slice of pizza.  One slice turned into a half a pie. Ran into Ang, and I told him, you were right the pizza there is one of the best in the city. They use real chicken breast for their chicken sandwiches. And their pound of fish is to die for. Did I tell you, Ang, then said, I forgot to tell you why the food is so goddamn good, because I own the place. Beware, if you know Ang like I do, he love to tell corny ass jokes.",
