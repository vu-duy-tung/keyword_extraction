    "text": "Your standard, no-frills diner. Open all day err day, coming here is practically a requirement after a night on Walnut Street. Even during the daytime hours, I prefer Ritter's to Pamela's. Ritter's is spacious - no matter what time I show up, I've never had to wait. It's not anything to marvel at, but it's diner food, and you're getting exactly what you think.   Their menu is typical diner food, but more expansive than most - I was a little surprised to see seafood options. Ultimately, I always come back to the corned beef hash. Exactly like canned corned beef hash in every other diner, but that's exactly what I'm looking for. I also occasionally order the wings because Ritter's makes them the way I prefer - freshly fried, naked, with your choice of dipping sauce on the side. I've occasionally tried to branch out but find other dishes lacking. The meatloaf was dry, lacking in flavor, but still a very heavy dish; the burger was even dryer and was served deconstructed - in a bad way. However, friends have had the differing variants of the pancakes and enjoyed them.   Overall, the cheap prices (yet cash only!), 24 hour convenience, and rectifying my late night munchies get Ritter's a thumbs-up in my book.",

The breakfast items are all pretty standard but I do enjoy getting it sometimes for dinner.  Some of the other things you must try are the grilled chicken on a pita or the diner burger.  The menu is large and I constantly flip through it even though I know it like the back of my hand.  The service is usually very good and I love the quarter jukeboxes at the tables.",

Just as we were walking out the door an older gentlemen ushered us in and right to a seat. The cash only sign almost scared us off.   Anyway food is typical diner food I had a bacon egg and cheese bagel sandwich and it was fine for the price 5.85 with home fries. Waitresses were very attenative with coffee and water refills and brought us our food quickly. You can't always get nice service in busy places so that was a big plus.   I can tell this has been Pittsburgh oldie for a while, its not a new age vegan vegetarian friendly joint. although several vegetarian options (with egg) on the omelette portion of breakfast menu. Also several greek american type salads and dishes (gyros) if you're into that.   If you're looking for a cheap greasy nostalgia this is it, if you're seeking a spectacular garlic potato, red roasted peper and asiago cheese omelette you're not gonna find it here. I liked the people owner and wait staff and food is decent so I gave it four. Sometimes you have to know what you came for and just be happy with that :)",

We were greeted by a hostess who sounded and smelled like she just got done smoking. Instead of escorting us to a seat, she told us which tables to pick and to seat ourselves. I ordered the sirloin of beef with mashed potatoes and my fiance got the steak and eggs. The food was just okay. Our server was friendly and attentive. We were thankful we didn't have one of the other servers, who was clearly dying of pneumonia or bronchitis or something. She was coughing up a lung in front of everyone and sniffling every 5 seconds. She washed her hands a lot, but the hostess did not wash her hands upon returning from smoking outside. Kind of gross if you ask me.",

I wasn't in the mood to eat after midnight, but that's not the reason why I didn't order anything. The reason why I didn't get anything was because when we walked in the diner, I looked at the variety of dishes other patrons ordered and felt slightly sick to my stomach. Must've been my inner conscious that the food is bad news and I guessed correctly. My brother had the Arcadian burger and by sunrise, his stomach didn't settle well. Had no desire to eat throughout the day.  Trust your eyes, nose, and instinct. It's most likely right.",

The PIC (Partner In Cuisine) and I have eaten there a few times, but those times were really out of desperation because nothing else was open.

When my wife and I walked in I thought, this place doesn't look too bad, actually kinda cool.  WRONG!  After being seated it probably took 5 minutes for the waitress to come over and another 5 minutes for our coffee to get to the table.  Our food took about 45 minutes, which is absolutely ridiculous for standard breakfast, but I though, everyone thinks this place is great, I guess I can wait for perfection.   The food gets to our table, it looks good, it looks like breakfast, but it is cold, well mine was cold.  So I'm sitting at the table, empty coffee, cold breakfast and quite pissed off, because of the situation and I'm hungry.  Finally after about 10-12 minutes the waitress comes by and asks how everything is, I tell her my food is cold, and I'm fine and don't need another plate, we had already been there over an hour, we had placed to go, ya know.  When the waitress brings the bill over she doesn't just tell me she took my food off, she says, I figured I would take the food off even though you didn't ask (really?  should I have to?).  Wife's food was hot, but she thought it to be just average breakfast.  I never want to go back, but I will, because I always give places another shot.  Terribly slow service (server was very nice though, probably home from college), and food took forever.  I doubt this place puts out cold food on a regular basis, because this place wouldn't be so packed and highly regarded.",

Cash-only is a smart move and keeps the menu prices down, though it seems the cashier (owner?) only cares about counting dimes and nickels instead of ensuring guests are satisfied. Nonetheless, a good stop for simple quick and easy diner food. Good luck to all the staff with their personal issues :)",

Fifty cents a play and it only takes quarters. It's easy to have your own little dance party in the booth.  As many have said before, cash only. So if you don't already have your cash or stopped at an ATM, no need to worry there is an ATM right as you walk in.  Not sure if its like this all the time, but it's a seat yourself type of establishment.  When we were there the place wasn't too busy and easy to run for the one server manning the floor.  I love the fact that the server wears scrubs being in close proximity to Shadyside hospital (of course don't expect surgery here).  The place is set up like a classic diner inside with the addition of some late model wood paneling. It's hideous, and I love it. From the booths to the counter seats (where I assume you have to be a regular to sit there). Even the desert case at the register, sadly only filled with minimal treats to take with you.  The bathrooms are typical and scary. I walked into a swimming pool waiting to happen because someone forgot to turn off the water.   The food, hmm the food. What an interesting array of food to have for this place. From grape leaves to meatloaf. Speaking of meatloaf, that's what I had. Two decent size slices of meatloaf, a scoop of diner mashed potatoes, and the gravy on the side. I also opted for the side salad, which was simple with iceberg lettuce, onion, tomato and green pepper. And the fresh (is it really fresh?) bread that they give you is amazing.  If this place is this good at night, I can only imagine what it's like during the day.",

Ironically, I am pretty sure I hated it as a kid. I love their buckwheat pancakes now though. Truly a PA tradition for me. And my BF enjoyed their French toast.  Sat at the bar to be served right away. Scrubs-clad waitstaff was friendly and prompt.   They only take cash *gasp* but luckily for me (a.) there's an ATM in the front of the place, and (b.) my credit union will refund my ATM fees every month. So yeah, not a big deal.

It was incredibly chewy and truly the worst thing I've ever received at a restaurant.  When I pushed it away, I could still smell it from the other side of the table. Proceeded to sit there and wait for the waitress to come back so I could tell her about the omelet, but she never returned to our table. I had to walk up to the counter to tell her it tasted old. It was pretty mortifying since I never return food. The one good thing was that she took it off our bill.",

    "text": "Ritters is where I go for diner food when I don't want to wait at Pamela's or it's an off-hour time. Standard diner fare but with a Greek twist.  I very much like the stuffed grape leaves and the spinach and feta omelette. I haven't sampled much else on the menu because I'm vegetarian and the dinner options are limited in that regard.  On a different note, I find the diner atmosphere to be a little depressing. The interior could use some cleaning and sprucing up. Additionally, several times I've been there the table has smelled strongly of cleaning product, which is not very appetizing.  I would really like to give it 3.5 stars, but that's not an option.",

    "text": "Got exactly what I expected from retro-feeling diner like this one. I was starving and really needed some food in me, and it was comforting and satisfying for occasions like this just the way it should have been.   I got a bowl of chili, pork chop and eggs (with toast), and some tea. Everything was fine. Nothing spectacular, but I mean... it's a 24 hour diner. Everything was well-cooked and tasted fine.   Minor complains include the cash-only aspect, the fact that they prebutter your toast (I never had a place not ask or just give it on the side tbh), and that nothing is seasoned! I hate trying to pour salt out of a shaker on luke-warm food and having the crystals not dissolve into the food or the food be salted evenly.. but if that's what you prefer...   I don't come here often and was stuck in the area waiting for an appointment, so this was a good breakfast. Dependable diner food exactly what I expected - comforting, well cooked, and it'll always be there 24 hours a day! The people seemed like regulars and the staff always joked around with them... it's a nice environment for a morning/late night meal (my usual diner hours). Maybe they'll even season your food and not butter your toast if you ask. Definitely better than any food I'd had at Eat'n Park at this hour.",

Yes, it is a million years old inside and out, and so are the waitresses.  There are 3 or 4 waitresses and they share as many teeth.  But this place is old Pittsburgh and you gotta love it.  The food is good, not amazing...unless you're drunk.  Then it is f---ing fantastic.    As per Pittsburgh standards, even bad food is pretty good if served in large quantities.

Conjure up in your mind the image of a perfect diner: Booth seating. Open late or better, 24 hours. Breakfast served all day. An eclectic mix of patrons. Waitresses that call you \"darlin'\" or \"sweetie\". Bottomless coffee. A certain fragrance mix of fry oil and cleaning product. Cheap prices and fast service.   And there you have Ritters. As I sat and enjoyed my eggs, bacon, toast and coffee, I saw all of these elements uniting in near diner perfection. Add to all of that a stream of customers all of whom the staff seemed to know by name and greeted with smiles, hugs and good-natured ribbing. The only thing missing that would make this place the pinnacle of diner-ness: the rotating pie case.   I can't speak to the dinner fare but come on, if you're not ordering basic breakfast at a diner, you're missing out on one of the great comfort food traditions in these here United States. Get a mess of eggs and breakfast meats, some toast with too-much butter and a coffee, pay $10 for it all (pay up front! no new-fangled credit cards accepted! wow!), and sit back and enjoy this wonderful slice of life. Pie optional.",

I couldn't even finish my breakfast! The more he yelled the madder I got. I got up to talk to one of the original owners about what I had been listening too and he did not seem surprised at all... He took my check away so I didn't have to pay BUT that was not my point... He seemed embarrassed but, after he walked away, I watched to see if he would confirm Mr Little John but to my disappointed, he did not... Waiters & servers are extremely hard workers, they endure so much from the kitchen, the customers, they are on their feet ALL day long taking care of the whole restaurant and getting paid very little so they depending on their tips to make a living & still greet you with a smile! They deserve & should demand more respect from their employers!! I am so mad about this, this is not the end of the story.... I will be back to confront him personally but, to respect the waiters, I will wait for a less busy time. I gave my gal a larger than usual tip and told her that they should strike & make Little John be the waiter for a day!!!! I know they are afraid of loosing their jobs & probably won't stand up, they need someone who will stand up for them! Ask my husband, Little John is in for a big old can of whoop ASS!!",

I was given a huge portion of three fluffy pancakes, a large portion of eggs & three pieces of bacon. The bacon was actually a little disappointing- it tasted as if they bought the cheapest kind, or maybe it was just a bad batch? Everything else was delicious. I saved one of the pancakes for breakfast the next day & it was just as good. The egg whites were perfect and were super filling. My boyfriend loved his french toast, home fries and sausage. The home fries were delicious. I love that you can listen to music on the jukeboxes while you enjoy a delicious breakfast!",

My boyfriend got pancakes, scrambled eggs, and cinnamon toast too. The pancakes were horrible, he said those were some of the worst eggs he's ever had, and the cinnamon toast was just toast with cinnamon on it you can't even call it cinnamon toast.

    "text": "I stopped into Ritter's for breakfast this past Sat. morning at 11am.  Despite living two blocks away and having driven by many times, I'd never dropped in until now.  Given that I needed an inexpensive and convenient place to meet someone who also lives nearby, I figured it was as good of an opportunity as any to try it out, so I suggested it and we met for Sat. breakfast.  Fortunately, my friend arrived 15 min. before I did and was able to secure a table, since Ritter's gets quite crowded on Sat. mornings.  Also fortunately, the interior is quite large, which is necessary given its popularity at peak hours.  Once I was seated, our server promptly took our orders, which was appreciated.  However, it took almost half an hour for the kitchen to get them out, which seemed long, given the amount of time that my friend had already waited, and that I've received prompter order fulfillment at other diners, such as the Dor Stop.  Once it finally emerged, the food itself was pretty standard quality diner food--nothing to write home about.  Given that it was Halloween morning, I ordered the pumpkin pancake special ($5.99) with a side of bacon ($2.50).  I could definitely detect pumpkin in the pancake batter, which was nice, but I've been spoiled by the Dor Stop's pumpkin pancakes (which are available year round, BTW), and these didn't hold a candle to them.  The bacon was also disappointingly chewy, to the point that I didn't even finish part of my last strip.  My friend ordered the chicken sandwich, which seemed of similar mediocre quality, though I didn't try it.  Overall, Ritter's met my standards for diner food, but didn't exceed them, and failed to meet them in some respects (chewy bacon--argh!).  One thing Ritter's has going for it is that the prices are quite reasonable; however, come prepared as only cash is accepted.  I realize that a lot of their business comes from inebriated customers late at night, so if that describes your situation, it probably hits the spot.  If you're willing to travel and are looking for a good weekend morning breakfast, though, I recommend the Dor Stop in Dormont or Central Diner and Grill in Robinson, both of which illustrate that diner food can be better than mediocre--in fact, it can be great!",

The quarter got stuck per ushe and I hit it. KA-CHING!!!! Out came like 9 quarters!!! Nine! But then the cook came over and made me give them to him. Atleast I told him that 75 cents was mine so atleast I'm leaving up but dang that's fucked up and while I will always love this place I will never forget the night I got robbed by the cock at ritters.

The menu is very big so you can get a lot of different things, but it never comes out as good as I expect it to and my expectations are about average. For example, I ordered my steak medium rare and it was well done. I don't usually send stuff back, but it was just really not close to what I wanted to eat for medium rare. The next one was better but very rare on the inside because they took a slab of meat out of the freezer and immediately cooked it without letting the meat come to room temperature. I still go often because it's good enough and close by but definitely manage your expectations.",

The parking is off to the side and a little bit cramped but it was nice that the did have a lot instead of street parking. We were quickly seated and the waitress came right over to get our order. Everyone was very friendly and they made Anthony's day when he found out they had milk in the little cartons like they have in school. We put our orders in and I got the grilled turkey & swiss. It didn't say on the menu what type of bread it came on and I probably should have asked but when it came out it was on rye which I can not eat. I apologized and we asked the waitress if I could switch and she assured us that it wasn't a problem but apparently the cook felt differently. You could tell he was beyond annoyed when he angrily came out of the kitchen and stared at our table. There was only one other table so he wasn't slammed with orders so I really don't understand why he looked so annoyed but it was pretty uncomfortable. Other than that the food was delicious. Travs burger was huge and Anthony loved his spaghetti and once the sandwich was fixed it was excellent too. I would definitely come back.",

The service and food is consistently good and there's just about something for everyone. I've sampled a bunch of different items like breakfast foods, chili to fried green tomatoes, hot turkey sammy and the steak & cheese sammy, just to name a few. No complaints.   I like the fact that they have the little jukeboxes at the table with a variety of older music to pick from. I just played Gypsy the other night and no one was disturbed by me bobbing my head and attempting to sing along with my girl Stevie.   Lastly, if you're looking for ambience....this ain't the place. If you're looking for a meal that will satisfy at a really good price point with some friendly service by folks who will chat it up with you if you engage them.....then this is your place!

We were seated around 12:15, ordered and the waitress came back to the table twice between 1215 and our food arrival at 130 after sitting with empty glasses and no sign of the waitress for a good half hour. Our food was cold when it came out to top it off. A group of 3 was seated next to us when we got our food, ordered and received their food within 10 minutes and had their checks given the same time ours came out. The place wasn't crowded enough to blame it on being busy, so I'm confused how we were caught with such terrible service and cold food. Told the lady at the counter what happened and she couldn't have cared less. Probably won't be making a trip back for a while",

A few of us went out after late night bowling to get some food. We went to Ritters because it was literally the only place open within a 5 mile radius and we were starving. Anyways, we made our way past the pack of chain smoking waitresses on the front steps and were seated. Every surface in this place is covered in a thin layer of oily grime. It's clear that cleanliness is not a priority here. Your hand will stick to the table if you touch it. And the bathroom looks and smells like something out of the movie Saw.  The waitstaff didn't even pretend to be friendly and honestly looked like they just rolled in from a halfway house. Also, our frail, elderly waitress was clearly extremely ill and really shouldn't have been handling food. The food itself was pretty terrible, but it's a diner and the only option around after midnight, so whatever.  We got the bill and proceeded to the counter to pay. The little old white-haired curmudgeon who I guess runs the place shuffles over to the counter, rips the bill out of my hand and says \"Give me $28.38\". I politely ask if we could pay separately (there were four of us). He grunts something inaudible with a sourpuss look on his face and I ask him to repeat himself. He then raises his voice and rudely says \"Give me $28.38. I don't have time for this, I'm very busy\". It was 1:00 am, there were maybe 10 people in the entire place, and all he was doing was sipping coffee at the counter. He could have just said \"Sorry, we don't split checks\" and it would have been fine. No need to be nasty. He's like the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld but not nearly as funny. You shouldn't be mean and condescending to your customers if you want them to return. I know that neither I nor my friends ever will.",

I also like the broccoli cheese omelette-- because it's a broccoli omelette topped with cheese sauce, and far as I'm concerned, cheese sauce is a food group.  There are mini jukeboxes in the booths--fun!  The prices are fair. You get exactly what you need and pay for. (Somewhat Soapboxy) In fact, I really like that they do not have enormous Pittsburgh-sized portions. You get regular-sized omelettes or pancakes on normal-sized plates. If you're over 30, you might recognize these portion sizes from your childhood. Frankly, I don't want to overpay AND overeat.

    "text": "I remember my first experience at a diner: Art Deco-inspired architecture, narrow and long floorplan, jukeboxes, neon signs, quick service, and extremely tasty pancakes with chocolate syrup! Granted I was only 7 or 8 years old then, but I can recall everything (how can I forget the taste of those pancakes?!). Since then, I've been to quite a few diners, including diner-restaurants (i.e. faux diners). I would go particularly on the morning after a night of partying and/or drinking, when I'm feeling too lazy or hung over to cook something decent without burning myself and my kitchen. On these mornings, I would typically order pancakes or omelettes with a side (usually hash browns) and coffee. Honestly, I've never eaten anything other than these breakfast staples at a diner.  My friends and I arranged to have a late brunch one day at Ritters Diner. Now, I didn't have much to eat the night before, so I couldn't wait until we met to have something to eat. So, I came to the diner having already eaten a light breakfast. A quick observation of the diner made me realize that this isn't a traditional diner; instead, it seemed more like a diner-restaurant. Oh well, there was still the service and the food to worry about. We sat down at a booth in the large room in the back of the restaurant. The waitress greeted us and took our drink orders immediately: two cups of coffee and two glasses of water. Several minutes later, we got our coffee and water, but weren't ready to order just yet. We spent several more minutes deciding, and when we were ready, we placed our menus in a neat stack in the center of the table to show that we were ready to order. We waited...and waited...and waited some more. Minutes turned into half an hour and longer. By that point, my friends were getting quite hangry. I was sitting there feeling sorry for them and very concerned with the poor service. This whole time, I was monitoring discreetly the other diners who had our waitress and arrived after we did. A few of them actually have gotten their food, have paid, and have left. After what seemed like an eternity, our waitress suddenly materializes and takes our order.  We get our food: chocolate chip pancakes; club sandwich; spinach omelette with cheese and buttered toast; and something else (sorry, I must've had too much coffee). My omelette was decent; I would have preferred if they hadn't used too much cheese, especially what I think was American cheese (it could've been cheddar, but the taste didn't seem right). The toast was good, but I was too full to keep eating. I did try a bite of the chocolate chip pancakes, and it was so rich and delicious! My other two starving friends pretty much inhaled their food in minutes.  Based on this one experience, I would come only for the pancakes. Service was really bad even though the place was half empty. I might experiment with this diner once or twice more to get a better feel for it.  So to summarize: not a real diner, service was bad, food was decent, and come for the pancakes.",

It will always be home-cooked, open and ready to accept you regardless of the time of day or the day of the week. All that is truly required is that you find one item on the menu that you really enjoy. For me, that one item is the Grilled Chicken Breast Dinner. I almost always get this item with the veggie of the day, sliced tomatoes or sliced cucumbers. It always tastes good and it never breaks the bank. Sometimes I might get breakfast, but usually it is the grilled chicken breast.  Everyone should try Ritter's at least once.  They only accept cash, but they do have an ATM present at the entry. Every now and then, I do allow myself to order a slice of the freshly made banana cream pie. Wow...it is tasty.",

I started off with a bowl of the lemon soup, which I enjoyed thoroughly. It was either too hot or too cold, but good enough for any of the three bears. After that I had a breakfast plate, and it was fast and fresh!  For this part of Pittsburgh, I found that the prices were reasonable for what I received, the service, and also the ambience.

Most diners have the Italian toast like Mancinis or Breadworks. I got the Corinthian omlette which wasn't bad, but wasn't good either. The coffee was good at least.  My wife got poached eggs, the toast (from a bag), and the canned fruit. She tried a buckwheat pancake to taste because it was \"different.\" But it tasted pretty bland.",

They have a lot of Greek dishes, but you will find mostly diner food. My favorite...the fried chicken!!! The dinners are inexpensive, come with 2 sides and taste great!  They are a cash only establishment, so be mindful of that before you walk in. They do have an ATM there if you forget. The wait staff are really friendly-you can tell they have been there for years.

Three of us came for breakfast and by the time our food arrived we were \"starving\". But even with that, nothing tasted particularly great. My chocolate chip pancakes had barely any chips, and they were barely warm enough for the butter I put on them to melt. Eggs were bland and not at all fluffy. Corned beef hash was overly salty. Breakfast steak oddly tough. The coffee was good, though, and it was frequently refilled by our friendly waitress. But, that alone is certainly not a good enough reason to ever come back.",

She put in an order for scrambled eggs that were more softly scrambled. The bus boy who came to give me the new eggs showed up with sausages and made comments about how I didn't know what I was talking about. I'm the one stuck with eating the food buddy... if i don't want to eat them because they taste too dry, then they're too dry.  The waitress put the sausages on a plate to be sent back (to the next customer I assume). they over corrected the eggs and were way too runny.

They didn't have the fried green tomatoes that we wanted to try...oh well. The food we did get made up for our brief disappointment. We had the greek hobo omelette (how could you not want to try something called a greek hobo omelette??) with feta cheese, as well as a stack of buckwheat pancakes. The omelette was really flavorful, and actually tasted like a greek gyro as stated in the description, especially with the yummy tzatziki sauce. The home fries were awesome - perfectly crispy browned layer. Buckwheat pancakes were pretty decent as well, and the syrup was nice and buttery. We left glad that we had decided not to wait in line at Pamela's!",

Typical of diners, they have a huge menu complete with your diner staples to some unexpected dishes like spanakopita. Their service is fast and gritty by girls in scrubs. Their food comes out just fast. The quality of the food is above average for diners and definitely better than chain restaurants. I've had the whole gamut of their breakfast food with the buckwheat pancakes being particularly tasty. The eggs are usually cooked correctly as well. I've also tried the chili cheese fries that were glorious after a night of jovial celebrations.  I don't however recommend steak, a friend ordered it and as expected it was not good. If you stick to he staples, it's hard to find better diner food in the area.",

    "text": "I really wanted to  give this a great review, because I have very fond memories of this place when I was a kid with my mom and also when I was in my early 20's hitting this place after 3 AM.  Alas,  I went there this morning and found out it really is just your typical greek diner with a giant menu.  I give it kudos for the jukebox on the tables (Sopranos finale style) and I thought our server was great.  She easily had been doing this for 40+ years.  The atmosphere is good just like any other diner you would go too.  I was here this morning with my friend Fiona and we both needed a hearty breakfast to help with our recovery from the prior night.  The coffee was good and plentiful.  We never had less than half a cup.  I had two poached eggs and white toast.  The eggs were poached perfectly and the bread was appropriately soaked with butter.  All in all this was pretty good.  My bacon was also fine with three healthy strips.  However, Fiona was less lucky.  She had a veggie omelette which was average at best, size doesn't matter with respect to omelettes I'd rather less eggs, but super beaten so the omelette is light.  The veggies were plentiful, but I'd prefer the veggies lightly sauteed, so texturely there isn't such a difference from the eggs to the vegetables.  The sausage was good, but cold.  She asked for crispy bacon and it wasn't crispy at all, in fact it was exactly the same doneness as mine.  The homefries were okay, but I prefer a little more crust on the potatoes.  I'd say this is a perfectly acceptable diner, but I'd recommend you'll enjoy your meal much better if it's at 2 AM in the morning as opposed to 10 AM on a saturday when most of your whits are about you and your palate is not dulled from the Tequila.",

The rating is not for the food, or for what the places looks like or feels like. This rating is for what Ritter's REPRESENTS. Ritters represents late nights after the bar with friends. Ritters represents the meal that will soak up the alcohol and save you from a wicked hangover. Ritters represents 3AM with your friends, not because anyone is particularly hungry for chicken tenders, but because the bars are closed and no one is ready to go home quite yet. The laughter and fun shared at late night at Ritters can be replaced by nothing else. If you are looking for awesome food, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for standard, 24 hour diner food and an awesome place to people watch once the bar doors close, this is your place. It is so awesome to see all of the club goers pile into Ritters after dancing on a dark dance floor....hair a mess, mascara looking more like a raccoon than the model they were just a few hours ago and limping in those fierce heels they thought looked SO cute when they hit the dance floor. This place is an institution among those who spend their early/mid twenties in the Oakland/Shadyside/Bloomfield area. If you haven't spent a late night at Ritters, you are missing out.",

Service was friendly and quick, with unlimited coffee. All was good and in generous quantity. I must note the link sausage was of a more generous size than often encountered.  The offstreet parking lot is brilliant. The menu is quite reasonably priced. Ritter's accepts cash only. An ATM is on the premises.",

I got the roast beef sandwich with fries and she got the meatloaf sandwich with mashed potatoes. The food was very bland and left much to be desired.

If you are looking for a fancy dining experience, look elsewhere. This is as diner as they get!  The food selection here is vast. While I've only ever visited for breakfast or lunch, their food is as you would expect. Breakfast is cheap and delicious, with options varying from omelettes, pancakes, grits, and breakfast meats. The portion sizes are quite large and make for a super filling meal.   Ritters is not usually overly busy and I've never had problems being seated. It is a cash only joint so be sure you have some on you. Otherwise they have an ATM at the front you can use. Parking is pretty easy with street options as well as a parking lot of patrons.

I had a chance to dine here with a number of other Yelpers, and I think we all absolutely loved eating here.  Firstly, I'm in love with their menu - a lengthy list of America's classics and favorites with a few extra non-traditional additions just for good measure. Choosing what to eat at this diner was my biggest challenge of the past week. I eventually settled on the Greek Hobo omelet, which is a delicious mix of gyro ingredients that comes complete with a side of Tzatziki sauce to go with the ensemble. Add in the amazingly fresh hash browns and heavily buttered toast, and I was served up quite the feast. And I devoured it like the happy glutton I was!  Not only did the food leave me happy, but keep in mind that my group was a group of over 10 people - all of our food was at our table within 15 minutes of ordering. And based on the comments of \"that's delicious\" that I heard all around, that speed is all the more impressive due to the quality of the food that was produced.  I will definitely make the trek out to Ritters again in the future - especially now that I know that they have their own parking lot, as parking is the biggest reason I don't venture to this part of town very frequently. I need to try a few more things that caught my eye on their awesome menu. (But next time I'm definitely remembering cash, as they're cash only, and I admittedly don't want to pay an ATM fee to get cash in their main room every time I eat here.)",

It was definitely pre-mixed long before we arrived, which wouldn't have been bad except they also mix in the croutons, were become gross and soggy after sitting in a bowl of salad.  My fried chicken was excellent. Perfectly crisp with a great batter, and not too salty. I had home fries on the side which were well cooked but very much under-seasoned.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I go to Ritter's probably about once or twice a week now, usually around 3AM (yes, the best time to go to a 24 hour diner). I get a grilled cheese and fries every time and he now gets the patty melt every time, though he went through a few other dishes before settling on the patty melt. The grilled cheese is good - hits the spot. I have the food palate of a 4 year old and the grilled cheese is delicious and buttery without being soppy and overly greasy. My boyfriend got the steak the first time and was horribly disappointed, but I cannot fault Ritter's for that - he always gets steak at places that proooobably don't specialize in that kind of food. It was oddly overcooked and past well done on one side, but almost rare on the other. Don't really know how they did that. The next time he got a sandwich that had turkey and some other kind of meat and it was good, but now he is totally in love with the patty melt. His apartment is right near Ritter's, which is good and bad (good for the yum and bad for the waistline) and he always wants to come and get a patty melt.   Don't go and expect to get 5-star high quality cuisine. But for what it is - a greasy spoon diner - it is very good.",

    "text": "Finding a good ol' diner in Pittsburgh isn't exactly easy. Pamela's has great breakfast, but is in no sense a diner, and there are many good sandwich shops, but once again, they aren't diners.  Having only been there once so far, my review may be a little skewed. The restaurant has the diner feel, no doubt. There are jukebox machines at every table up front and the decorations harken to the setting of a greasy spoon restaurant.  It was busy when we went, so the food took a while. The wait seemed longer than it should have been, but as I said, the place was packed and it was exactly lunchtime. On the menu it stated that they used \"premium maple syrup\", but I'm pretty sure I just got corn syrup in a cup. The coffee was somewhat watery but still alright.  I ordered the french toast with eggs and bacon, all of which was rather bland (Except the bacon, a meat which has some inherent godliness to it. You can't mess it up). Basically, it seemed like a meal I could have whipped up lazily on my own, and in less time. The bread for the french toast was plain white toast and I normally prefer a better bread. The eggs were eggs: good without any pizzazz.  While Ritters is cheap, from my small sampling, I found the food boring. Most good diners have some excellent menu item, and perhaps I drew the short straw. I might return to Ritters later, but it's certainly not the diner I'm looking for.",

Ritters is a good place to go when other highly attended brunch locales are going through their mid-morning rush as it has two large dining areas to seat customers.  You will definitely get seated and served faster.  The food was good, better than the crappy dinner experience I thought I was going to receive--as Ritters just kind of exudes a 'here-I-am-take-it-or-leave-it' diner kind of vibe.  It wasn't amazing, but it was good.  Also, I paid for three of the breakfasts (myself and the two larger of the men) and somehow none of us went hungry and the bill was just $15 and some change--for three people!  I even had some food left on my plate.  Our server wasn't awesome...she was clearly unhappy to be receiving another table (I'm not assuming, I overheard her say it to another server).  However, she got the job done I suppose (in terms of water glass refill).  Ritters is CASH ONLY so make sure you bring yours! (or someone else who wants to buy you breakfast)",

The major draw for me was how cheap everything was- you could get a full meal for probably under $5! We got coleslaw, 3 spanikopita, a pancake, 2 eggs, toast, hash browns, and 2 coffees for under $20. That was thrilling in itself, especially among all the newer more expensive places coming to the area! And the restaurant is open 24/7 so you can always get your cheap fix. It was also quite clean for a diner, and they had fun individual juke boxes on each table so bring 50!  There weren't many creative options for vegetarians, but you could definitely get by with any sort of egg/cheese/bread/potato combination for breakfast. They serve lunch and dinner 24/7 as well, and the veg options looked sparser for this part of the menu. Vegans would have an even tougher time.   The major downside for Ritters was how slow service was. We probably spent longer here than we would at a nice dinner, so be warned to only come when you have ample time. The servers are extremely nice and hardworking, though! I'll probably be back for another lazy breakfast.",

From the decor, to the taste of the food, to even the staff uniform, it's to me what a diner is all about.  The inside is like a throwback to any diner that's come and gone. I don't think the interior has been updated, well, ever, but while it's outdated, it's completely charming which includes the old jukeboxes on the tables.  The staff wear uniforms in the form of nurses scrubs. I assume because it's next to the hospital? I never really knew why for certain.  The menu is typical diner flair and the prices are cheap. On my last visit I craved some blueberry pancakes which I really enjoyed.  This place gets crazy when the bars close. Nothing makes a drunk feel better than some breakfast food at 2am, especially when that meal costs the same as one beverage.  Service here can be dicey at best. My last visit was crazy. You could tell the server was not feeling it today. I let her do her thing, it didn't bother me, but don't come here expecting world-class service because that's not going to happen.  The place is cash only but there is an ATM at the front for you to use.  If you're looking for an old-school diner with cheap food that taste good then this is going to be right up your alley. If you have any need to be waited on hand and foot then you might want to try someplace else.",

Second visit I decided to pay more attention to the details because I wish to pursue a career as a professional Yelper.   The water performance was far better the second time around and I was very pleased. My garden salad was honestly below average, and had little to no nutritional value. Bread rolls weren't half bad once you get into them and used the butter. My entree was the chicken parmigiana and it was atrociously bland and it was extremely upsetting. The pasta came on the side and was in a meat sauce which is an interesting partner with the chicken parm. 2 of my friends ordered the same meal, one described it as \" you do not want to order this here,\" and the other had to send it back because it looked beyond wonky inside (under cooked). I attached a picture below.   As far as the service, it was average. I will cut them some slack because we had a larger party, but at the same time they were not very busy. My waitress did not smile or say excuse me once when reaching on to the table. Also the employees are wearing scrubs and it makes no sense.   At the end of the day the best part of my experience was the water and it might be the best water in town who knows. But I expect nothing less from a city like Pittsburgh... what a dump.",

This visit was at a normal dinner hour with the family.  When we walked in local tv personality Ken Rice was in front of us.  He was obviously a regular because he was quickly greeted by one of the waitresses.  We were told we could sit on the left side which was fine.  Our waitress came over to us relatively quickly.    My oldest son ordered chocolate chip pancakes with bacon, my youngest son had the kids chicken fingers.  My wife had a Ritters melt type sandwich, and I had the meatloaf dinner (home fries...ahhh!) with beef noodle soup.  The soup was ok.  We all thoroughly enjoyed our meals.  Portion sizes and prices were fair.  As other yelpers have shared this is cash only so plan accordingly.  There is an ATM in the restaurant if needed.    I'm not anticipating as long of a gap between visits.  My youngest is already asking about our next visit.  See you soon Ritter's.",

I would recommend this place if you like simple food with good taste and large portions. Not fancy but a simple neighborhood diner. We enjoy the counter but tables and booths are available.

But the home fries left something to be desired.  They had no flavor - it's like someone boiled some potatoes and slapped them in a pan and served them on a plate.  I put some salt and pepper on them, but it didn't really help - it's like the potatoes were determined to be tasteless.  I ate a few forkfuls and just gave up.    I came here for a meeting in the morning and it wasn't crowded.  Looked like there were some regulars but fairly low key.

It's not BAD by any means though. Also you only take cash and have one of the shadiest ATM machines I've ever seen...

Remember if you can after a long night out that this establishment is cash only.   You are never going to get great service here, and for the most part at night when the entire place is packed full of belligerent drunks why should you? The waitstaff does their job: takes orders, brings out the food, and refills your drinks, but don't expect much more and surely don't expect to have all your requests pampered. I feel bad for the waitstaff who have to deal with drunks all night, especially on the weekend.  This is a Pittsburgh landmark, nice diner vibe, and a place where I will always have great memories.

    "text": "Any establishment that's open 24 hours gets bonus points in my book.  It's my firm opinion that any business that serves customers on a walk-in basis should be open 24/7.  I mean, yeah, there's that circadian rhythm thing that keeps every business from having the graveyard shift, but I'm sure we're only a couple decades away from curing the need for sleep.  Point is, Ritter's is 24 hours, and as a result it's been a standby ever since I moved into town.  The food at Ritter's is definitely better than what you'll get at a Denny's or a King's.  It isn't top-shelf, artisan food, but it is pretty good diner food.  Ritter's is also a great place to go hang out with a few friends late at night, and BS over coffee when you're just not feeling going to a bar and blowing mad cash on drinks.  Or for stopping by after you've already blown your mad drink cash.  The waitresses are nice.  The fellah who usually rings us out was really rude to me at least once.  I think he was the owner or manager or something, too.  But I'm not really sure.  The place is cash-only, too, which sucks.  However, the fact that they're cash-only leads to a really encouraging story about the place: one time the ATM did something wacky and I thought I may have been charged without having received my cash.  The waitress took down my name and phone number, which I thought was just to get me to stop complaining, but sure enough someone called me the next day and gave me the run-down on what had happened.  I'd call that good service.  If it's late and you're peckish, don't forget that Ritter's is open.",

    "text": "Great food, quick service, nostalgia: what more could you ask for?   My dad brought me to Ritter's many times when I was a kid, before we moved out of the city. Now that I'm commuting to Pitt, I'm back. Before even talking about the food, I'd like to say how nice the staff is. They're always in a good mood, and they know their stuff. In the three years that I've been going there I don't think that they've ever let my coffee cup go empty.   Breakfast is excellent, no matter what time of day you have it. I especially love their homefries, which are nice and crispy but not overdone. This may seem like a minor thing, but you'd be surprised how many restaurants can mess up a fried potato. If you're coming in for lunch I would strongly suggest one of their salads; the lettuce is fresh and crisp and so are the toppings. If you get a steak salad, the steak comes right off of the grill and onto your plate, along with the fries. The soups are also delicious, although the Greek Lemon Soup is a bit sweet. I love their Navy Bean and Beef Barley soups, can't get enough of them. For lunch or dinner they have good comfort food: meatloaf with mushroom gravy, pork chops and kraut, stuffed cabbage, etc. Some days they make a homemade Greek pastitsio (did I spell that right?), which I think is even better than what is served at the Greek Food Festival in Oakland.   One last thing that I'd like to say is that they know how to make eggs over-easy. I like my fried eggs very runny or dippy or however you say it, and Ritter's makes them just so. A lot of breakfast places that I've been to tend to give you over-medium when you ask for over-easy. Just another indication that the cooks know their stuff.",

If you're looking for a late night, drunken fourth meal, this is your place. If you just want a no frills, greasy spoon, Saturday brunch, Ritters is there for you.  This place is blocks from where I live which makes it even better for me, and it is open 24 hours! One of the only places in town, or at least on the East End that holds that title. Perfect for those of us that frequent Bloomfield, Shadyside and Lawrenceville for late night fun. I can't tell you how many times in group of friends looking to satisfy their drunk munchies (or otherwise) in the wee hours that RITTERS!! is shouted. It's there, it's open and ready to serve you anything from it's extensive menu of diner food.   It's also good anytime, to go in and watch the old yinzers on a Saturday morning, drink their coffee, read the paper and just being so Pittsburgh. Served by waitresses in their nurse scrubs that always call you 'hun.'  The food - I have never had a problem with the food. I love breakfast and I don't think I have gotten anything else here. I think maybe my sunnyside eggs were undercooked once - but that has happened to me at really nice restaurants too, and eggs just seem to be something that is done wrong fairly often. I think their hotcakes are pretty darn good and that is my go-to meal. A great hangover cure, always.",

    "text": "So after the encouragement of many of my friends I decided to gave this place another try.   We had the fried zucchini, spanakopita, and their fish sandwich.  I was prepared to be disappointed by the food again but I instead I had to kick myself on that last review.   It was still diner food, but as far as diner food goes, it was impressive. I didn't even know diners served this vast variety of food.  I am a huge fan of breakfast food, because besides it being the most important meal of the day, I love the doughy goodness and comfort of pancakes and waffles. This time I was dissuaded from ordering my usual and instead opted for some proper dinner food.   The spanakopita was a bit soggy but otherwise the meal was above satisfactory. I had my first experience of fried zucchini and now I know what the fuss is all about! They're a delicious alternative to the classic potato fries and I delight to try them again.  While many people are unfavorably disposed to fish,  I love it. I think it's an acquired taste, but their fish was perfectly crispy and the tartar sauce wasn't half bad either! I would definitely go to this place again for a late night meal.   Also their mini jukeboxes are incredibly cute so if you're feeling extremely nostalgic of the '40's then I'd go here.",

For awhile I would go there every Saturday morning before I went to work on Walnut St. I almost always was in a bit of a hurry and never had much of a problem making it to work on time as the service is usually pretty quick even though it gets crazy busy for weekend breakfast. I almost always order steak and eggs for breakfast as they have one of the best ive ever had and its reasonably priced. I have also been in here quite a few times for lunch and dinner with my kids. The menu is gigantic and they really have sonething for everyone. Ritters is not just a diner, its more like a cornerstone of the neighborhood, or an instution rather. Its been open since practically the pre-historic era, and with good reason. It truly is that old school long standing diner without any frills or attemept of being hip. Its one of the last of an unfortunate dying breed. Service is always great with a little bit of that \"kiss my grits\" type of attitude. Hands down the best diner and one of the best resturants in the city!",

I love greasy diner breakfasts like Pamela's or, for those of you who have experienced it, the Venus diner; it's out of this world! (ha ha! I kill me)  I feel like Ritter's is one of those love it or hate it kind of places. Love it or not, there are some things that make this place really unique....the waitresses all wear scrubs, like nursing scrubs...which I find ironic because sometimes after clogging my arteries with my three meat omelet I feel like I need medical assistance. The coffee, I swear on my life it's that chicory crap that southerners love. It def has a....distinct...taste. The atmosphere is decidedly grubby-chic, but in a good way. They clearly have not put a dime into the place, but it works somehow.  They, like Pamela's, only take cash, but there is a little ATM in the foyer.   Like I said, the breakfast is greasy and delicious, as it should be. Of all the other things I've had there, the burgers are kinda icky, like frozen semi-meat rounds. The specials, ie stuffed cabbage, tuna casserole, meat loaf, usually need salt or some other flavor factor. You will notice a Greek theme, because the family is Greek. They have a few different Greek foods like Gyros and grape leaves and things. I've had the gyro and it's not bad, but if you go and they have the lemon chicken soup on special, GET IT! I loved it. Never would have thought it, but I did.  I've never had a problem with the staff. Some are more talkative than others but they are all pretty nice and accommodating.  Oh, and they are pretty good on pies too!!",

Sometimes the food is good; sometimes I could barely eat it. Sometimes the servers are attentive and very friendly; sometimes they have a terrible attitude. I've had delicious meals, such as the breakfast items, sandwich melts, and honey-dipped fried chicken. And while breakfast is usually solid, lunch and dinner varies.  For example, my most recent trip here (a few days ago) was dismal. My friend ordered pierogis like he always does because they are usually very very good, but this time we sent it back for some butter because it was bone dry. When it was brought back, there was a small hair in it. I ordered a grilled chicken salad; it's hard to screw up a salad but Ritter's managed to do so. Yes, the portion was huge, but I found yet another hair in it and there was a pool of water at the bottom of the bowl.   My tip is to order breakfast foods because they don't mess that up and it's good. Going in during the day seems to bring about better service and food.  Even though eating here is a hit or miss, I have a feeling I'll be back to try my luck. It's one of the few places open late after the bars close, so...",

    "text": "I have only really been here late night so keep that in mind  Ritters is located within walking distance of the bars in Shadyside and Bloomfield and unfortunately it's the only place open  at 3am. As such I have been here more times than I would ever want to...  If I were blackout drunk cooking on a George foreman grill I could make better food...  If you like your eggs served in a puddle of miscellaneous  kitchen liquid, or bite into a chicken parm sandwich and have the breading slip off of the entire piece of chicken this is your place!!!  Though I could list the horror stories I have experienced I will concentrate on one that summarizes this diner....   Friend orders a milkshake... Only gets the glass and not the residual leftover in the mixing metal cup... He drinks it rather quickly and wonders if the leftover will ever come... So he waits and waits keeps looking at the counter where the leftover bit is just sitting there... 45 minutes later waitress finally walks over to it, drops a little bit of icecream in it mixes it... Puts it into a glass and serves it to someone else.  We called it the circle of milkshake life...in that every milkshake is half old half new.  People keep coming back perhaps because they like the little nickel jukeboxes or because nothing else is open , I have even heard it being called a Pittsburgh culinary institution... I'm sure the brothers primanti, Pamela, and the delucas  are rolling over in their graves... If they are Infact dead.  What's sad that though I am downright disgusted with this place at times,I know that I will return one drunken night ... Fml",

Getting there around 3:30AM the place is always bustling. I like the energy and definitely need some good American diner food after driving around the same bar crowd that's now at Ritters. Late nights on the weekend are typically louder because of the drunk crowd but I've seen a stern woman playing Mom for these kids mandating that they cannot squeeze 4 into a booth seat. In my guess over half of the guests at the time had been drinking that night, harmless college aged kids and young adults for the most part.  The staff are always great to us, perhaps just relieved they don't have to deal with more frat bros and party girls. My girlfriend and I are always treated very well, one waitress even comp'd us an extra order of mozzarella sticks lol thank you! As for the food it really is that classic warming diner food that makes you feel good before bed (or nap time!) My girlfriend always gets the reuben and it is honestly fantastic. I get the Southwest Burger and it's just the best balance of BBQ sauce, onion rings and burger patty.   An iconic classic diner with genuine staff, I really enjoy going to Ritters time and time again. Do bring cash as this is a cash only diner. 5-stars Ritters, see you this weekend!",

    "text": "I was visiting a church in the area and decided to try this diner. It had mixed reviews so my curiosity got the best of me.  The menu is lengthy. I am a huge breakfast food fan so I decided to order breakfast. I usually go the eggs and bacon route, but flipped the script when I saw the Coco Loco pancakes. They are pancakes with chocolate chips and coconut. I also ordered a side of bacon. My son got bacon & eggs that came with toast and home fries.  When my pancakes came they looked like your typical pancakes with a light sprinkling of coconut and chocolate chips. There was also a drizzle of chocolate syrup. I was a tad disappointed. I ate the top pancake and it was incredibly delicious. I thought \" it's too bad this is not in each pancake. Still hungry I started eating the two remaining pancakes. Oh. My. Word. There wasn't any coconut in them but they were packed with chocolate chips. I'm talking packed!  They were some of the best pancakes I've ever had. The side of bacon was a little salty which was needed to break up all of the sweetness of the pancakes. My son eats \"dippy\" eggs ( runny sunny side up). I'm not a fan but he enjoyed them. Living in the Burgh we are used to getting Italian bread as toast but this was True blue white sandwich bread. He cleaned his plate so that should tell you that he liked it a lot.  The diner is exactly that-a True diner. It has never been updated. The menu has probably been the same for more than 25 years. But if your parking lots (they have 2) are filled that means you are doing something right. The cars were everything from old beaters to Porches. That says a lot as well.  We will definitely be back to try other menu items!!",

There's a large menu, but you can essentially build your own breakfast from French toast to omelets to various combos. Nothing to write home about, just good ole breakfast blockbusters. Add the endless cup o' coffee and 24x7 schedule (now only on weekends), and you've got yourself a go-to diner for the yinzers.

Stains were present from other diners...no biggie...I will ask to have the table wiped down. While I listened to the waitress arguing with another old timer over the price of a roll (who manages this and let's this stuff go on?), I decided to check the silverware. Yep...leftover food particles. I have a healthy immune system I think....well then my sprite came in a clear glass. The white milk like stain on the inside of the drink was slowly flaking off into my ice....last straw...I told the waitress and walked out. FILTHY MCNASTY!  My morning review is below:  Walked over from UPMC to have breakfast. Typical diner look and menu. I really don't get the hype as the food was average at best. The server was nice and attentive thus the third star. One thing that bothered me was one old man who just got up got behind the counter and helped himself to drinks. Clearly a customer and not an owner. I may try something else but really underwhelming concerning the hype.",

    "text": "Note #1: Lemme hear a big CASH ONLY! An ATM can be found inside for your convenience.   Note #2: Ritters is a 24/7/365 restaurant that offers its entire menu from breakfast to lunch to dinner all day and all night every single day. And man, did we have a blast with this! Keep readin', pilgrim...  I am not a lush of any kind, and this past Friday morning, I unsuspectingly fell madly in love with Ritters Diner.   We had thought of going to Ritters during the graveyard shift one weekend, but being that the establishment reportedly attracts Pittsburgh's young, intoxicated, and obnoxious during that time and that I have little patience for such humanoids, that plan was nixed. However, on a frosted, lightless payday Friday morn, Kay was waiting on a background check before she could start her new job, and I needed sustenance before work. When we both awoke earlier than expected, Ritters immediately came to mind, and suddenly, it was Bloomfield or bust!  I enjoy a wholesome, solid, mountain-man breakfast sans bells, whistles, and rainbow jimmies as much as any other blue-collar bloke, but when burgers and fried chicken can be had at 6:30 AM, omelets and pancakes become too drab and obvious. Besides, I'm also an Aquarian, and when put into boxes, we tend to think our way out of 'em.  And the Pittsburgh City Paper said that Sousa's main gentrification vehicle Salt of the Earth \"blurs distinctions.\" Heh.   Enter the beast known as The Pitts-burger. Centered 'round a thick, bleeding medium-rare patty, this Goliath of ground beef included BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, grilled onions, bacon, and a fried egg. One of THE essential burgers encountered during my dining lifetime, it dripped, oozed, kissed, stung, and occupied that roaring void in my stomach like few have. The bun was toasted and was not without a hint of butter. The Pitts-burger may strangle your heart, but it will do it so, so softly.   The french fries were burning majestic scepters of yellow, mashed potato chip glory.  Kay's fried chicken smacked of honey, crackling when our teeth punctured the  homemade batter to reveal sultry poultry inside. Our lovingly irreverent and streetwise server told us that Ritters sells more clucker parts than the nearby KFC does, and I want to believe her. The Colonel's mass-produced swill deserves to be outclassed.   Our desserts were Chocolate Cream Pie and Strawberry Shortcake. The Chocolate Cream Pie should be renamed the Chocolate Dream Pie for its velvety, otherworldly pudding filling, it's flagrantly flaky crust, and its sweetness-cutting whipped cream garnish. The Strawberry Shortcake was akin to slices of golden shortbread mortared together by preserves and topped with a gilded white buttercream.   To us, there was nothing dingy about Ritters. Jukeboxes lined the perimeter of the dining room and abstract sculptures of labyrinthine iron jutted from sides of the booths. Burly, middle-aged men in work clothes patronized the diner instead of immature partygoers. Some are making Ritters out to be a \"last chance\" sort of place that they seem to want to like less than they do, giving out backhanded kudos to it as if it were a dirty old strip club that amused them and nothing more. When I looked around Ritters and relished its classic, economical cuisine, I saw, tasted, and felt nothing but timelessness, integrity, and an affectionate mindfulness of quality.    I don't know how many years Ritters Diner has been in operation, but I do know that I'd hate to see it uprooted by renewal and replaced with something that is exploitative of indigenous food such as Thai fusion or whatever else the privileged have co-opted this week.  Forgo the East End's glitter and skitter o'er to Ritters for some food that will leave ya the opposite of...bitter.",

The waitresses, who wear hospital scrubs as their uniforms, were friendly, but they seemed rather tired while I was there. Nonetheless, my waitress was attentive and provided efficient service. Ritter's Diner is open 24/7 and whatever is on the menu can be ordered any time of day. So for brunch, I ordered a steak breakfast that came with eggs, home fries and toast. Everything was delicious!

I just went to Ritter's, if for nothing else than to put a menu online for everyone to see. Yeah, that place is that old and that outdated.  My Order : Eggs/Sausage/Potatoes/Toast, Fried Chicken and French Fries and finally, Chili Cheese Fries.  The good: - They have parking, though their lot is a bit odd. No parking = no visit from me. - The eggs were pretty good. Can't say anything bad about them and they were some of the better eggs I had.  - The potatoes/home fries were also pretty good.  - I really like the consistency of their french fries. Their fries are long and taste good. - The breakfast prices are reasonable. - They do have a wide variety of options on their menu. They have seafood, burgers, hot dogs, chicken, steak, breakfast food, ice cream and other stuff.  The bad: - It's 2015 and they have no website or menu. Think about that. I have no idea how they could ever find customers not from the local area. They could put up a website for free and a menu as well. It would take less than 1 day of their time. There's restaurants from third world countries that have menu's online. - They want $1.75 for cheese on their eggs. I can almost buy a full pack of cheese for that price - The fried chicken is so so, but they want $7.70ish for one chicken wing sized leg, a mostly small breast and an even smaller leg. Not worth it at all, since you can get a better deal at Popeye's or KFC, who I both find expensive. Their chicken is better too.  My friend got an omelet of some sort and seemed to really like it.  Would I return there? I could see myself returning for a quick breakfast once in a while, but I don't see myself going there for dinner.  Recommendation: I can't say I recommend you going out of your way for this place. There's really nothing special about it, but they do have a wide variety of options on their menu, parking and the breakfast prices are reasonable. It's no Peppermill(a chain of diner restaurants in the west that are fabulous) though.",

    "text": "The food at Ritter's tastes like I made it at home, and this is not an endorsement.  I had the feta and tomato omelet, and it tasted skunked, like it had just been cooked in a dirty skillet.  It's a dirty diner with meh food, but it is open 24 hours.  If you're drunk, I bet the foood is great.",

Bring quarters if you feel like setting your iPhone down for a minute to listen to an old school, \"flip menu\" jukebox.  Just don't play any Survivor if there is a couple breaking up in the booth next to you.",
