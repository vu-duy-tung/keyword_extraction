When the bill came not only did he not add the appetizer but he had comp'd the rest off the meal and told us \" if you have room let me know what dessert you would like or if your full let me know what dessert I can pack for you.\" That extended to my whole table. Great food. Great service.",

    "text": "Stumbled upon this restaurant one hungry Sunday evening via the help of yelpers. Well I hope this help future restaurant goers.  Food and wait: There was no wait and the restaurant was 3/4 empty. We should've seen this as a warning sign for things to come. We ordered the Kobe burger, the nachos, and crab bisque. The crab bisque was the highlight of the evening, warm, delicious, and o so creamy. The pot roast nachos, large in size but the meat was too sweet so I ended up spending $13 on chips, cheese, jalapenos and sour cream. The burger was my friend's highlight of the night, mostly because he was up all night with food poisoning. Not so cool.   Service: Even though there were only a handful of tables, our waiter was absent the majority of the night. There's nothing that urks me more than having to play \"I spy the waiter\" in an attempt to flag down the bill.   The crab bisque was great, but would I come back? Nope.",

    "text": "With complete sobriety, I will state that this past Friday night, Ditka's delivered to Kay and I an ambitious feast full of upscale standards that were not innovative but were consummately executed. One doesn't go to Ditka's to experience maddening originality or to be at the white-knuckled forefront of gastronomy; one goes to Ditka's to experience tradition done exceedingly well.   Take for instance the Oyster Shooters. Each of the two I had merely contained a meaty, chilled oyster, a potent cocktail sauce, and an even more potent tabasco vinaigrette. What else is needed?   Being that it was a Lenten Friday, I resisted the urge to get steak and opted instead for the Maryland Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes and the Giant Baked Potato, which I substituted for the rice pilaf. The twin crab cakes were so pure of meat, I wondered just what was binding the pieces of protein together; any filler there may have been seemed non-existent. The chunks of meat were massive yet dainty, and the fabulously flaky helpings of cake themselves were munificent. In a small, metallic cup was a textbook remoulade (called 'tartar sauce') that merely added opulence to an already opulent dish with its union of creaminess and tang.  Is there a better crab cake on the market? I'll throw down the gauntlet for Ditka's for these crab cakes were every bit as burly as the man the restaurant is named after and were quite simply sterling in every regard.   The Giant Baked Potato lived up to its name and came with cheddar cheese, bacon, butter, and sour cream. Colossal, leathery of skin like a football, and billowy of flesh, the spud was its own self-contained meal-within-a-meal. Just when I thought I hollowed the tuber out completely, there was more steamy starch to uncover.   Baked potatoes are a minor obsession of mine, or make that, were a minor obsession. Like the crab cakes, I doubt I'll find a better example elsewhere.   The cole slaw, a side that came with the entree, was artfully presented in a cup of lettuce. Cool and crisp, there was also some sort of unknowable quality to it. Was it a hint of ginger? Mint? What manner of herbal magic possessed this slaw?   Even the complimentary rolls were peerless. Delivered hot, they were accompanied not by butter packets but real whipped, decorated butter that resembled icing piped onto a wedding cake. Crusty on the outside, when cracked open, the rolls revealed rolling hills of cottony bread onto which the butter broke down divinely like an actress baring her soul onstage.   For dessert, it was something not listed on the online menu involving turtle ice cream, a chocolate dome, nuts, caramel, and a turtle. A little on the unwieldy side, this fortress of confection took some time to dismantle, but I found that the longer it took me to eat it, the easier it became to eat as everything softened. The turtle candy acted as a base. A large ball of ice cream sat atop the turtle, and all of it was encased in chocolate and garnished with chocolate drizzle. An exercise in excess? I call it a towering monument to what must be Mike's favorite candy, and I worshipped it like the graven idol it was.   Patrick, our server, was an absolute professional, and that's all that needs to be said about him.   Don't dismiss Ditka's because of the celebrity nametag attached to it or because it's a chain (there are only 3 of them in the entire United States) in an area full of them. The price point is steep (our tab was over $90), but the portions were hefty and every single thing we ate was nothing short of superb. Go on a special occasion and treat yourselves or someone you care about. Take in the gloomy, intimate decor of the quiet, walled-off dining room. Look up at light fixtures that resemble slivers of the moon as you indulge in some magnificent steakhouse fare. Let Mike take care of you and yours. After all, one gets the impression that he opened a restaurant merely because he wanted all of us visiting or living around his hometown to have a good, classy time every once in a while in a place he himself would like to frequent.  P.S. We didn't need to make reservations on a Friday night. Our visit was strictly impromptu, and I reckon Mike would approve. Guys like him don't make reservations.",

Our server was friendly and helpful.  We ordered the strip steak, pork chop, mac and cheese, asparagus,  and red skinned potatoes.   The steak and potatoes were very tasty.  The asparagus was average and the mac and cheese was bland and tasteless.   The most disappointing dish was the pork chop.  It looked impressive stood up on end and served with a cherry reduction.  The taste was horrendous.  It tasted more like an old cured ham than a pork chop.  Overall Ditkas disappointed.  The steak, while better than the cheap Outback-style steakhouses was not quite on par with Capitol Grill, Hyde Park, or Mortons.",

It's not that our experience was bad, but it doesn't rank high on our list for a steakhouse. Compare it to any other suburban steakhouse, like Outback, and it wins hands down, but if you're expecting the caliber of a Ruth's Chris or Morton's, you should brave the traffic and tunnel and visit the real deal.   The calamari appetizer was delish, according to my husband, the calamari aficionado. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned well. The oysters on the half shell were fresh and meaty with both cocktail and horseradish sauces. The Filet Oscar was so-so, a little overdone and it needed some additional seasoning to spruce it up. It was accompanied by some rather skinny and limp asparagus with a boring Bearnaise sauce. My pan seared scallops were a little overdone and came with only four small scallops. On the other hand, the mushroom risotto that came with it was very tasty.  Desserts were fair. The cappuccino was cold with no froth so we had to send it back. The replacements were hot, but not up to snuff either.  I have to admit that service was very good.  Our server realized that we hadn't seen each other in a long time so she gave us ample time to gab and peruse the menu. They didn't rush us through our meal, and let us linger at our table as they began to close the dining room down.",

    "text": "I have come to ditkas a few times so far, with 2 of these times being 6 stars out of five, and the last experience being a 3. I have liked it enough in the past that I chose it to be my birthday gift, as unfortunately I do not earn the salary to spend $100 a meal unless it is a special occasion. I assure you, however, if I did I would be a regular.   I did eat basically the same meal on each occasion, which was prime rib.   The good: the first two times the meat was exceptional, some of the best of my life, and I admit that my eyes closed, my heart skipped, and a smile crossed my face while I enjoyed this heavenly dish. I sang it's praises to my friends. I also love that it comes with horseradish, and the au jus is just right.   I also enjoyed a wedge salad each time - and ditka's has choice blue cheese dressing with enough chunks of the stuff to make you gleeful. I will order this every time I'm here. I only wish that it also included cucumbers, though I would imagine that they would have honored this request if I had remembered to ask. This salad could be lunch in and of itself.   The mac and cheese: I tend to say that cheese is my favorite food group, so I have high expectations here. This isn't the best I've had in my life, but it is creamy yet also cheesy goodness spread over cavatappi noodles (my favorite), topped with bacon and baked to perfection. Their other sides are probably also good, but I'm not sure if I'll ever be over the Mac and cheese enough to try them. Someone else at the table receive the biggest baked potato that I've ever seen.   The bread! I love when a meal starts off with fresh, crusty bread and real butter. Here you will get it piping hot from the oven, and it is truly one of life's simple pleasures.   Soup: my boyfriend gets the crab bisque. I try to distract him long enough to steal bites because if I order one to myself I won't have enough room for salad AND Mac and cheese. It's really good!!!   When we went for my friends birthday they offered complimentary cake and ice cream. I was sure I didn't want any until I was basically force-fed a bite. Then I realized that it was incredible and happily ate my share. I wish there was an way to eat literally all of the aforementioned in one trip without feeling terrible afterwards.   The bad: the last time my meat was overcooked. Prime rib should, in my opinion, never be more than medium, and this was rather well done though I did not order it that way. It was still good, which would be a difficult feat for another restaurant, though it wasn't 'birthday dinner' good. My father ordered the filet, and he felt that the $50 price tag was unjustified. For that much I do agree that it should be at least a 9/10, and this is a steak restaurant. It seems that we may have experienced an inadequate cook and inattentive server the last time, which does not seem to be the norm. I will still return, and hopefully all is well and right again when I do!",

We enjoy the variety of food choices and they do a nice job across the board. I was sceptical since many of the sports celebrity restaurants don't always live up to their reputation, I can vouch for Ditka's in Pitts.  We have had the crab cakes twice and definitely a great hearty dish, don't have it if your looking for a lighter option it's a good portion and real chunky crab meat. My family had the Chilean Sea Bass twice and really enjoyed that dish. Rare to find a steakhouse type venue with good seafood, usually they put fish on the menu to satisfy non-meat eaters but don't take it seriously. I enjoyed the 16oz Prime Rib, amazingly cooked and the mushroom accompaniment was delicious. I barely used any horseradish, the meat was so good.  Before sitting down I ordered a beer and the Guacamole/Salsa with chips, very impressed with the portions for a $9 appetizer. If I'm looking for a GoTo restaurant to share a nice meal in Pitts, I will be returning to Ditka's, hope everyone else shares the same experience.",

    "text": "First time at Ditkas... I had a Saturday night early dinner. I ordered a Fridge Burger medium rare with everything... cheddar, mustard, mayonnaise, onions, pickles, lettuce, and tomato. The burger was cooked to perfection and paired with your average steak house fries. This dinner \"meal option\" was great for it's relatively low price of just under $15. It's one of the few \"meals\" on the menu in this price range, unless you order an appetizer or side as your meal. I should mention... One of the members of the group I was with had a delicious looking dessert that she loved as well. It was the flour-less chocolate cake.  I'm just confused about the identity of this place. The menu hosts an expensive array of steaks and seafood. Dinner prices range from $22-$60. Yet they play hip-hop and pop music and sell t-shirts in the lobby? Not to mention there's a beautiful view of the highway traffic and a Get-Go gas station from the dining room windows. Don't get me wrong, the interior is gorgeous and I love the murals and photos on the walls. It couldn't be any cleaner inside and yes, the food was great.  However, remove the high-end prices and the somewhat uptight waiters/waitresses and you have yourself a Longhorn Steakhouse. Hard to imagine enjoying a $60 meal (not that I ever would) while watching someone pump gas into their mini-van across the street.   5- food 3- pricing 4- interior 2- ambiance 2- service",

    "text": "Not super impressed. I made a reservation here for a business lunch and specifically wrote in the notes of the reservation via open table that I preferred a quiet table that was perhaps more secluded. No mention was made of this upon arrival and we were seated at a table right in the middle of the main dining area.   I think our waiter forgot about us when it was time to order. Even though we were chatting, it had to be 15-20 minutes that passed before our orders were taken. He even came back to refill our drinks, at which time I thought he would take our order, but alas, he had to return the empty glasses to the kitchen first.   All three of us had salads. I had the mike's chicken. The salad was a bit on the small side but the chicken was plentiful and well seasoned and overall the salad was tasty. Not ridiculously filling, but that was okay with me for a business lunch. My colleague had the buffalo chicken salad, which came topped with 3 HUGE onion rings. Looked tasty but i'm not sure how he managed to eat it in polite company; he is a pro. Our guest had the steak salad. He didn't remark but to me it looked well done as opposed to medium, which is what he ordered.   It was fine for a business meeting but I wouldn't return on my personal time.",

The only reason this place doesn't get five stars is because nothing blew us away. It was all good and there were no complaints but there was nothing truly exceptional.   I would like to compliment The wait staff on going above and beyond to accommodate the two two celiac diners in our party. They even thought to remove the candied almonds from the house salad and offered to prepare foods specially gluten free.  Nice restaurant, and a nice nice out.",

For our meals she had the Chicken Madeira and I had the Surf and Turf. ( Fillet Mignon with a Lobster Tail. You can add a huge cup of crab meat to top you steak for only $5, which I did of course! I had the mac and cheese as my side and she had a wedge salad. My steak was cooked to perfection and the mac and cheese was spectacular! The wife thoroughly enjoyed her food as well.  Our daughter had her usual cheeseburger which she absolutely loved. Big shocker there! LOL!  Upon finishing our meals I was presented with a birthday dessert. A wonderful warm chocolate cake topped with vanilla ice cream. It was so so good. We all left completely stuffed.   While Ditka's is a very good restaurant. I still prefer Morton's for the price.",

Instead he sat at his table without a smile and agreed to autograph memorabilia that was for sale on a nearby table. No charm, no energy and no desire to engage with the attendees.  We like the restaurant. The food, service and design are all very good. But it's clear that management of the restaurant and Mr. Ditka have completely different motivations.

    "text": "Avoid at all costs. I've eaten at Ditkas in Chicago more times than I can count on two hands and two feet. I knew the quality of the meals and service to expect but I don't know where to start about Da Coaches place in his home town. What a disaster. Had a 10 top their Monday night and things couldn't have gone worse. It was Monday and of course the Head Chef and A team were not there and that became apparent once the food showed up. Apps might as well been from Dennys. Cold and rubbery calamari, cold pot roast nachos by the crab cakes were decent.  Here's the deal: The cadence and control of the waitstaff and the kitchen is completely out of sync. Waitstaff, under trained, young and not seasoned. Clearly the practice squad and not the starting lineup.  Soup had a layer of dried Scum on top from sitting under the window too long. Salads were average.  Main course: crappy crusty, flavorless steaks served on \"Cold\" plates?? WTF Mike? Cold plates? I refused to eat my 45 day old filet as it was not 45 day old aged and the outside was burned to a crisp, the inside dry and tasteless while the red interior had zero heat. The Monday chef cooks like a caveman!! I sent back the filet  and ordered a NY Strip instead. It was good but not that good.  Bottom line: This is not your real Ditkas folks unless this Ditkas was in a hospital commissary where the food is only slightly below average but you don't care as the experience you are going through tending to a sick friend in the hospital overshadows anything you might eat there.   To quote Da Coach: \"Effort without talent is a depressing situation... but talent without effort is a tragedy. - Mike Ditka  We could not have said it better! Sorry coach, DItkas in Pittsburgh is a losing team.",

I ordered the Delmonico Ribeye with a light salt and pepper coating, cooked med rare and it came out w a lightly charred crispy outer crust that was devine. I sprinkled on a small pinch of their coffee rub spice mix across the top and poured a small sampling of their in-house butter sauce on the plate then began to simply cut, chew and smile. Over and over and so on. The grilled onions as the side were a sweet surprise. I was in heaven.   Even the \"Mike\" mixed greens salad w the light vinegrette dressing over the goat cheese, cranberries, nuts was again delicious. I left no crumb unturned.  I was so focused on the steak that I forgot about the perfectly cooked long asparagus tips w bernaise starring at me. Even Mike's in house Lager was good enough and  respectable enough to compete with most micro brews any day.  The waitress was also delightful and knew the menu and the steaks well. Her comments made all the difference.   I went there while in Pittsburgh for one night and I wanted a Pittsburg steak to provide a great memory to go back to Tampa with. The experience lived up to the well appointed restaurant details and then some.   Read what you want but when in town do as Mike would,  bring some friends, have a good beer and order a great steak.  Thanks for a good experience. I was hoping to see at least Mike and being a HUGE Steeler Fan, maybe Bradshaw, Swann,  Greene or Big Ben would be hanging around but it wasn't meant to be. I guess I was disappointed when it comes to setting a fee expectation but then again we all do it.  T",

The executive chef was so sweet to talk the menu over with me on the phone in advance to explain what he thought would be a good choice.  He also told me that if I called 30 minutes in advance, they can have it all done! Sucha relief! Since everything needs to be separated to keep fresh, I normally get turned away from the good quality restaurants.  But the day of the trip, it went just how I hoped. I called on my way to the restaurant and had everything packed by the time I got there. My passengers on the flight were so thrilled so have such an amazing coursed meal! They loved everything.   Crab cakes- were the best I've had  Cold crab legs- no dipping sauce needed  Lobster tail entree! Filet mignon- no need to add any sauces as well!   And mind you, this all tasted delicious even after I reheated the items on the plane!   Thanks so much again chef to you and your team!",

    "text": "In a sea of chain restaurants, Ditka's stands out in a number of ways. First, the decor is lush, dark, and \"club-y\". Clearly this is a steakhouse of a high caliber. Had dinner at the bar, and all the staff I dealt with were friendly, professional and geared toward pleasing the customer. This is good because Ditka's is probably not the best place to go if you have a gluten intolerance. The menu is not GF friendly at all. Surprising at this price point, and in this day & age when most upscale eateries (and almost all the chains) have either a dedicated GF menu, or clearly have thought about steering you toward certain \"safe\" choices. And there were very few things on Ditka's menu that could be made GF without clearly ruining the idea of the dish. Nevertheless, my server worked hard to find a choice that would work, and work it did!   Started off with a delicious glass of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. Ditka's gives you a very decent pour on your glass of wine, and in fact portions on everything here are generous. I was eyeing up the pot-roast nachos being enjoyed next to me at the bar. And the gentleman to my left had shrimp cocktail with crustaceans that might have been confused with small lobsters. Nice.  My prime rib and broccoli was perfectly cooked & seasoned. I'm not sure how there can be such a dramatic difference between the quality & taste of prime rib at various restaurants, but Ditka's clearly is among the best I've had --anywhere. Truly delicious, and not requiring any additional sauces, or condiments. The cut was generous (even the smaller size I ordered) and there was very little waste -- just a gorgeous slab of prime rib. Ditka's gets a very nice clientele, and the place was surprisingly packed on a Wed evening with some of the more well-heeled locals, and out-of-towners. This is one of the more pricey choices for dining in this part of Pittsburgh, but if you value great beef and high-quality service, it's worth every penny. Should the chef decide to adjust their menu slightly to better accommodate those with gluten issues, I'd give it five stars easily.",

    "text": "I've really enjoyed my visits here. Second visit last evening was just as we remembered it and perhaps even better. The first time we stopped at Ditkas it was a whim as we passed by with zero research. We were all blown away by the experience and the quality and flavor of the steaks that were cooked just the way we each liked. Returning has been on the list for a long time but just never seemed to fit in. Las evening we were in the mood for a great steak and after checking all the reviews and articles  the decision was made to give Ditka's another try. I honestly can't imagine that the more we'll know \"steak houses\" would have made us any more pleased. We arrived around 8 and one of the nice things is you can sit on the dining side with table clothes and all of the bar side which is quite nice but just a touch more relaxed. As we didn't get so dressed up we choose to sit on the bar side. Place setting, wine glasses and all were still present. We were given water upon sitting down. I really like this somewhat dying tradition. The menu is a good size and well rounded but not a massive one with too many things to really be good at making them all. I ordered a Manhattan and later a Tom Collins both of which were really well done. The only other drink at the table was a lager of some sort that got a definite thumbs up. Salads arrived in chilled plates with a chilled fork just after the warm rolls. The mike salad and the wedge were a toss up really, both were fresh, crisp and all the increments were well proportioned and presented beautifully. Both salads were really really good. A bit later after the table was cleared and new flatware was placed, again seems to be a dying tradition. We appreciated not having to ask for the table to be cleared. Steak and sides arrived and they looked amazing. The chat looked perfect and the smells wafting off them made my mouth water. New York strip for me and aged prime rib for my son. My steak was absolutely perfect medium. I'm not eve. Sure how they got it cooked that even. His prime rib was thick and cut with a fork. I had a bit of that as well and it's probably the best I've ever had. My strip was full of flavor just simply one of the best I've had. We wrapped up with a mascarpone cheese cake that was so decadent and delicious it was sad to see it gone. In the end Ditka's is a home run for us with two visits in and more to come for sure.   I literally forgot to take pictures because the experience was so nice it distracted me.",

    "text": "I ate at Ditkas for the second time in mid-September.  I had eaten there a few years ago with my wife and a few other couples.  I must say the food was outstanding this visit.  My friend and I had made a 5:30 reservation and were promptly seated.  Our waiter was attentive but not overbearing.  I had a mixed drink and my friend had wine.  For the most part, everything is pretty much ala carte.  I ordered a 16 ounce prime rib with red skin potatoes.  It came with bread.  The prime rib was flawless.  Great cut, fantastic taste.  Potatoes were very good as well.  As others have indicated, Ditkas can get expensive. Probably a little expensive for the location.  Certainly worth a special occasion.  I would definitely return if I am craving a good steak.",

Our appetizer came first, we ordered the calamari, it was a large portion and the best I have ever tasted. After we were done with the appetizer our salads and dinner rolls came. The salads were large and delicious. The rolls were hot and fresh. Every time (3-4 times) our iced teas were empty our waitress would bring us a fresh filled glass without us having to ask. After all of our salads were done, they brought out the main entrees. I ordered the strip steak with burgundy mushrooms and a baked potato. All was cooked to perfection and was delicious. My wife ordered the 12oz prime rib which came with burgundy mushrooms and she split a baked potato with my daughter because they were huge. she said it was the best prime rib she has eaten. My daughter ordered the filet mignon and shared the Broccolini with my mother very large portion and the steak was cooked to perfection. My mother ordered Da Pork Chop double cut, apple chutney, cherry jus, mashed sweet potatoes.  She said all of which were delicious. After we were all done eating they cleared the table and the waitress asked if we wanted any deserts or coffee. I had a regular coffee my wife had a Irish coffee my daughter had an expresso and my mother had decaf coffee. Overall it was a great experience. I would definitely go again!",

Steaks were all cooked properly, and the fine dining experience was exactly what I'd hoped for. I tried their famous crab bisque and I only wish I'd gotten a bowl instead of a cup! It's a definite must-try when you go. Their turtle dessert is also incredible, and a shot of espresso rounded out the meal perfectly. I'd recommend to anyone! They menu also offers a variety of seafood and burgers if steak isn't you're favorite options!",

    "text": "My fience and I love this place. It's delicious, consistent, and we don't have to go into town for a decent meal. The steaks are always cooked properly and the sides are yummy as well. We come here usually for special occasions (anniversary, birthdays) and I try and mix it up and order different things. After eating here for 4 years, last night, while exceptional, had me thinking. My few tweets on this place would be:   -offer an off menu special or two. The menu hasn't changed in years. I love consistency but sometimes it's nice to have something different. Or at least the option.   -add a few other options for white wines by the glass. I wasn't a fan of the only Pinot Grigio they had on there. I personally love being able to try different wines while I'm out and pair things with my meal.   -switch up the dessert menu. It's a little one note. Basics and all fairly boring. We usually get the same two things allllll the time, even if we want some thing different because the options are limited. Or offer a rotating specialty dessert. The menu is mostly ice creams, something chocolate, and the Cream brulee. The cheese cake option was chocolate, which was disappointing since they already have chocolate cake and a turtle pie. I'd love to see a white cake of sorts or something with berries. Just a thought.   -packaging. We usually order 5 courses and end up having left overs. It's sort of a peeve of mine that if I'm paying almost $200 for dinner (which I don't mind) my left overs are put in a white styrofoam container like I get when I order breakfast takeout from a diner. My other peeve is that both mine and my fiences food was packaged together without asking. I ordered crab with my steak...what if he had a shellfish allergy? The left overs would be a loss.   Sorry to sound picky. We do love this place. Like I said, food is always on point, service is amazing, ambience is lovely. The overall experience is good, just starting to get a little stale in my opinion. And for that, sadly, I knocked off a star.",

Seriously Ditka, maybe go on ESPN once or twice if you need some mad money rather than making the decision to choose any other run of the mill \"American seafood, steakhouse\" over yours, so simple.  The food is meh, but the low review is due to the price gouging on alcohol more than anything.  It would have received 1 star if not for the admirable service.  My friend and I walked in near close, yet the manager and waiter were happy to serve us.  Just because you used to play in the NFL, doesn't mean you get to charge stadium prices for \"craft beer\" like Sam Adams.  Unlike the Chicago Bears of 2016, I will not be returning for any more punishment.",

Determined to try something other than our Bocktown staple, the great Yelp reminded us that Ditka's was right up the road and a prime candidate for the picking.  The lunch menu is well priced for a medium/high-end steakhouse.  We both got lunch combos (the wife a turkey club and crab bisque, myself a reuben and salad) that were both filling, well priced, and quite good.  All in all, we made it out for less than $25 including tip, which is a small and well justified premium to pay over any of the other fast food options in the area.  Service was quick and attentive, and we were able to get in and out within 35 minutes...  exactly what we were looking for.",

Anyway, we asked the waiter to see f we can use a coaster or something to prop the water glass up and he said 'no one complains about it only kids do'. This was extremely offensive. Why not just acknowledge the problem and go find a coaster or something. The water glass was legit about to fall over and he moved it to place it on the side dish. Now we had to ask for more side dishes. What a waste of time. The food  was okay nothing special. Their vegetarian option wasn't even on the menu. I felt embarrassed asking for a veggi meal and the waiter did not help with making me feel better. His tone was hard and not accommodating. Also - it felt like they were forcing us to buy drinks to crank up the bill. Lastly, the table was not cleared when we got the check. I found this to be very rude.",

Not only did he listen closely to my concerns, but he made sure I had something to nosh on during every course that was DELICIOUS! It was customer service far beyond what I could've expected.

The side choices were good, but were not very hot when we digged in.   Over all for the kind of food you get it is very overpriced.

I had Mikes Salad and a previous reviewer stated it was heavy on the vinaigrette, they were right!  We celebrated a birthday with complimentary slice of chocolate cake & ice cream.  The birthday girl also received a card that the staff signed.  I thought it was a nice touch. I finished my meal with creme brulee and the best house coffee ever.   The cup said Lavazza;  I enjoyed 3 cups, needless to say I didn't sleep a wink, so worth it!

They were very attentive and we enjoyed.  For appetizers, we all split calamari (x2), nachos, and bruschetta (x2). It was a good amount of food and there were leftovers. The calamari was hot and crisp. The bruschetta consisted of triangles of bread with cheese melted in top and a bowl of chopped flavored tomatoes.  It was good. The nachos had a lot of jalapenos And were very meaty. They were a heavy appetizer to eat before a big steak.  My Caesar salad was tasty. The lettuce was chopped in small bite sized pieces and the dressing was good. There was a lot of cheese. I liked the garlic croutons which was surprising since I usually order it without croutons. But I forgot. I would order this again. The filet was perfectly cooked medium rare and melted in my mouth. The blue cheese on top was not shy! The mac and cheese side dish was good. Broccoli too. I didn't try the potatoes (jalapeo hash browns) but everyone raved about them. We skipped dessert.",

    "text": "Ditka's is one of those places I can give or take honestly. It is so hit or miss for me that the only time I go know is when someone else wants to go.   When with a group, we usually start out with a regular order of the Coach's Pot Roast Nachos. Which is pretty much just pot roast, cheddar-jack, jalapenos, sour cream and tomato. On a good day, the pork roast falls apart in your mouth and the cheese has that stringy consistency that you want when it comes to nachos.  The fridge burger is just your typical burger. They typically cook it exactly how I want it, so I really can't complain about it. I just think it is a little boring.   When it comes to the steak, I tend to like to go with the Filet Oscar. You get an 8 oz filet  (i like to get the garlic crust on it) topped with jumbo lump crab meat and bearnaise. Again, if it is a good day, this is a great dish. I only eat my meat medium rare and half the time it usually comes out medium well. The crab is usually cooked to perfection, and the bearnaise sets it off perfectly.  There are two things that are always consistent: the dessert and the service.  My typical go to dessert is the triple layer chocolate cake that is absolutely phenomenal. The creme brulee is usually on point as well.   Other than dessert, I will always rave about the service. The staff is always attentive and so nice. Always willing to help and answer any questions you may have.",

    "text": "I joined Yelp to write this review!! The absolute WORST service we have ever had!! My husband and I went here for lunch with our 9 month old daughter (3 pm as to not bother anyone if she got fussy); upon arrival we were asked if we wanted a booth or table. I said booth so I could slide the baby in her carseat but asked for a highchair too. The hostess said we could not put a highchair at the table because it would block the isle!! We were the ONLY table in the entire restaurant!! I was a bit annoyed but sat down to enjoy our lunch. Then came our waiter, Cameron!! Oh Cameron, the most condescending waiter I've ever encountered!! He came to our table mumbling the soups then said it looked like I needed a drink! (I guess referring to my annoyance with the hostess!) Um,  rude but I just said no thanks.... He started naming off drinks, \"mojito, bloody merry, wine...\"and so on. I just stated again, \"no thanks, I'll just have a cola!!\" To my surprise he continued trying to Make me order a drink!! I can't  believe a waiter would be so blatantly rude!! I honestly could not believe it! My husband calmed me down and we agreed to enjoy our lunch despite Cameron!! My husband and I were talking about what to order and he mentioned a burger. I said to him if he wanted a burger, we should have gone to Burgatory! Well to our surprise, here comes Cameron!!! Guess his eavesdropping got the best of him and he said \"What? You don't think our burgers are better than Burgatory?!!\" We just stared at him!! Needless to say, we hurried our order and our food came out sub-par at best!! Our drinks were never filled as Cameron was too busy watching the basketball game! He did come and finally take our plates away and with his ever so gleaming arrogance, brought our ticket!! Guess someone needs to remind homeboy he works on tips and to not be condescending and rude to the patrons!! I've never in my 30 years of dining out had a waiter be so openly rude! Reminded me of a King of Queens episode when the waitress tells Doug she is going to wait on him in the parking lot and gut him like a fish!! Haha!! Sorry Coach, we will NEVER be back to da Ditka's!! And Cameron, I'm afraid, may not be suited for the restaurant biz!",

Service was superb - quick, never had to wait to order or to receive my order...almost too fast.  The food (crab bisque (yummy and hot), steak (rare) with crabmeat and asparagus, ending with recommended spearmint cheesecake.  Had a martini to start, a glass of red with the meat, and a grand mariner with dessert.  I was satisfied with quantity and quality of food.  The total tab with tip for one person was $122...which I thought was a tad high.  But, overall, I enjoyed my meal, with attentive service and perfectly prepared food and drink.  Getting to this establishment is a bit of a challenge...I ended up cutting through a couple parking lots to get to it.  If you're in this area, I recommend Ditka's for a fine dining experience.  Although the place was \"packed,\" I was seated immediately (was advised a 20=min wait if I wanted a table other than the bar area, which, as I mentioned was quite noisy.",

    "text": "I was pleasantly surprised by \"da coach's\" restaurant and pleased that his only location outside of the two in chi-town happens to be in \"da burgh\".  Now, it's been a little over a month since I was here, so I'll do my best to spotlight the highlights.  We showed up at around 7 pm after a long day of on again off again golfing at quicksilver due to the weather.  It's located in the concrete and franchise wonderland that is robinson.  There was about 8 of us, so we didn't know if we'd have trouble getting a seat.  Luckily they serve the full menu in the bar and we were able to get a hi-top for all of us.  I don't remember anything that special about the space except it was what I expected.  There was a lot of dark wood, leather booths and some brass as well as some sports memorabilia of course.  The bar area was a nice surprise since it was a large bar with a few plasmas and ample seating. It's also the kind of place that you would feel perfectly comfortable in shorts even though they are trying to operate in the fine dining steakhouse category.  Our server was a nice gal' who had just gotten back from italy I think.  They had guinness I believe which was good, however I do recall trying a dirty martini with my dinner that was way too dirty. Think they reversed the olive juice to vodka component.  I recall geting the oyster shooters which were fun in that they were raw oysters served with tobasco and maybe a hint of vodka.  And, at $2 a pretty good price.  There may have been other apps' but I can't recall. I do remember Jason getting the sherry crab bisque, which was okay... a little too heavy and salty for me and lacking any discernable crab.  It was exactly the same as Atria's.  I also noticed \"pot roast nachos\" on the menu there must be a connection to the family who owns Atria's.  The bread was great.  It was served warm with delicious room temperature butter.  I don't eat salads, but remember thinking the salads looked great.  The salad had goat cheese, toasted pecans, cranberries and apples.  I took a chance and ordered \"da pork chop\", which was excellent.  The chop clearly had been brined to ensure moistness and was served with an excellent sun driend cherry jus and these killer mashed sweet potatoes (all for $22).  I think Corey had the lamb, which I sampled and thought they were top notch.  Brian ordered the ahi tuna, which was okay I guess, but who orders ahi at ditkas steakhouse.  The steak I sampled was pretty good, better than outback (which I like) but not capital grille,,,and also not capital grille prices.  All in all the prices were very reasonable for the quality of experience here.  They also get the small things right, like the bread and salads.  The sides are pretty interesting too.  I especially enjoyed trying Jason's \"blackjack sweet potatoe smash\" which was served with \"bourbon butter\" and bacon,,, really good comfort food.  I took my girlfriend home a gigantic slice of choc. cake, which I sampled and thought was okay, but only okay if you decide that size doesn't matter and remove the benefit of the ridicoulous portion size.  I also brought her home macaroni and cheese served with bacon.  It was also good, what you'd expect, but quite frankly I'm getting a little bored with the mac n' cheese with add on's.  I'll definitely go back to this place when in the area.  The service was good, food was very good and prices a very good value.  In fact, I've had much worse experiences for twice the cost. Good job coach!",

    "text": "This is my review #300.  Ditka's was open Thanksgiving Day -- a very good reason to give thanks.   I called ahead of time and made my reservation for 6:45pm. I was a little worried since there were so many people waiting and we were 45 minutes early to dinner.  As I heard the hostess tell people their wait time, my worry turned to fear that I would be waiting quite a while.  When I spoke to the hostess, she told me that there would be a long wait since they were the only restaurant in the area that was open.  I told her that I would wait until my reservation time.  It was at that point that her demeanor changed.  \"Did you say reservation?  Well, sir, right this way.  No one else waiting made reservations.\" the hostess exclaimed.  We were immediately seated in a circular booth overlooking the rest of the dining room and handed our prix-fixe menus with additional, select items from the normal menu.    My friend didn't even have to look at the menu, he already new what he was getting: the prix-fixe Turkey Dinner.  I, on the other hand was not going to eat turkey and so had to look through the rest of the a la carte menu to see what I was going to have for my dinner.  To help me along, I ordered our drinks:  Montoya Pinot Noir Absolute and Sierra Mist with a lime  The drinks came as I was looking through the menu.  There were, unfortunately, no substitutions allowed to the prix-fixe menu item under any circumstance.  With this new knowledge, I looked through and we ordered our entrees:  Turkey dinner (Turkey, Italian wedding soup, mashed potatoes, stuffing, green beans, Mike's salad, and cranberry sauce)  Filet mignon {medium} with butternut squash soup and mashed sweet potatoes  I decided to enjoy my surroundings while tasting my wine.  It was slightly spicy with some darker undertones and was enjoyable.  The dining room reminded me of a Members Only Club (or my imaginary conception of one) with its pillars, curtains that draw and separate different areas, and faux-ashlar stone walls.  It was a mix of rustic and demure done in a way that was not overtly offensive to my eyes.  Our server was quick to bring our soups and the salad.  Since my friend doesn't eat salads, I co-opted his for my own purposes.  It was filled with leafy greans, craisins, goat cheese (not feta), walnuts, apples and topped with a proper amount of balsamic vinaigrette.  The flavors were good and the sweet, tart, crunchy, and earthy flavors all melded together in a nice composition.  It wasn't the best balsamic I have ever had, but it was better than most places serve.  The wedding soup didn't taste bad, but it tasted more of a really good chicken soup with meatballs added as an afterthought.  There was nothing that truly made it an Italian Wedding soup.  The butternut squash soup had a very heavy butternut squash flavor -- this was a good thing.  I just wish that it transcended being pureed butternut squash to being more of a soup.  Don't get me wrong, it was good it just didn't taste or feel like a soup.  Our entrees arrived as I finished my soup.  The Turkey dinner was piled high on the plate on top of the mashed potatoes and the stuffing with green beans on one side and cranberry sauce on the other.  My filet came in the center of my plate with a gargantuan side of the mashed sweet potatoes.  I tried my filet to find that it was cooked perfectly with a nice, spicy flavor to the seared exterior.  I really enjoyed this filet.  The mashed sweet potato did not taste like sweet potato; it tasted like mashed yam.  Again, the flavor didn't bother me; it had good flavor and it wasn't stringy or lumpy. It just wasn't what I was expecting because of the name.  I looked over to the turkey dinner and was pleased to see that it was all-white, breast meat.  I tried the turkey (just because I don't eat a lot of it doesn't mean I don't like the flavor) and found that it wasn't dry and that the gravy complimented the turkey flavor without covering it.  I tried some of the mashed potatoes and they also had a very good, simple, potato flavor to them and the green beans also had a very good flavor while being perfectly cooked.  I didn't much care for the cranberry nor the stuffing and I am a stuffing maniac. We finished off the meal with ice cream and pumpkin pie.  Again, they tasted good, but I felt as though I could have purchased comparable at Giant Eagle or Publix.  While the food was good, the execution was not the best.  I give Ditka's 3-stars plus 1 for being open on Thanksgiving.  The service was spectacular, but the price on the non-prix-fixe items is steep.",

They also have some temperature issues to work out with their wine service.  There were some good Italian choices and decent  CA wines.  All in all, I will go back.  I thought the food was very inexpensive, so it compensates for the prices of the wine.  I found the service really good, but the servers not well educated on the food or wine.

For desert, I got one of the best Key Lime Pies I have ever had!  Throughout the whole dinner, our waiter and support staff were on top of things and great!  I really don't think I have had as great service like this before... I mean, I have had good and great service at many places, but Adam, I do believe his name was, was the perfect waiter.  I even walked out of the place with 2 cigars, and some of the sauces.that are for sale.  Will definately go back in an instant.",

    "text": "Such an amazing place! Ofcourse expensive too... We had calamari and bruschetta for starters. The calamari is fresh and well fried. One of the few places that served a crispy calamari. With a drizzle of lemon and the tomatoe sauce they give, this is the best. Bruschetta is like any other bruschetta you find at other fine dining restaurants.    They also serve freshly baked bread rolls. Once you break that bread, you will know that it fresh and the cold butter they serve on the side melts as you spread it over the bread. However, for a group of 7 people they should consider adding two small baskets instead of one big basket.   Coming to the entree, I ordered tortilla crusted halibut and lobster Mac and cheese. I should say that I didn't eat lobster Mac and cheese more than a couple of spoons, not because I didn't like it but the fish completely dominated the lobster Mac and cheese. It is the best well cooked halibut I had so far. It has a nice crust but it is not oily so it feels so light even after eating the entire dish. The corn salsa adds an additional zing to the fish. I should not forget about the tamale. It is so smooth and so flavorful.   Overall, I will consider going back again even it is a bit pricey.Also, other guests in my group liked the steak and seafood they ordered.",

    "text": "Our reservation was at 8:30pm on a Saturday. The place was full when we arrived but almost completely cleared of patrons shortly after 9pm. You can tell that the staff  mentally \"checks out\" after that and are ready to go home because our waitress was nowhere to be found 90% of the time.  Someone else dropped off our meal and walked away and the waitress never came by to ask if everything was ok. Problem was my father's \"Angus Prime Rib\" was an undercooked grisly piece of meat with tons of fat. He had trouble cutting it at first with his butter knife because no one had brought steak knives for him or my husband who ordered another steak. Not to mention I didn't even have silverware or a napkin so had to take one off of a nearby table due to our missing waitress. After I flagged her down and asked for steak knives he then tried to cut the meat and it was almost impossible to cut through with that knife. Again missing waitress so I had to ask someone else to see if they could cook it more to see if that would help. They ended up bringing it back grey and even tougher. Still no waitress to be found. So again had to find someone else to ask for a manager. He took about 10 minutes to arrive, tried to be nice but didn't seem very sincere. Long story short they ended up giving him a different type of steak after our meals were already gone and the place was empty. On a side note, I ordered the seafood platter for my meal. It came with crab legs and you would think they would bring melted butter to dip for that but must've forgotten that too. Plus the ice under the seafood was half melted and floating when they brought it so must've been sitting there for a while before I got it. I'll never waste my money there again.  I posted a pic of the seafood platter I ordered for $32. You get three pieces of shrimp, three squares of ahi tuna and a small crab leg cut in half with a little bit of meat. They put a lot of ice and spread it out in big bowl to make you think you're getting something. The broccolini has zero flavor. I'm not a big salt person but it didn't have any taste of even salt or pepper on it and was cold.",

I got the Mike's salad, which was really very good. For the main entree I chose the steak and crab cake and mashed potatoes. First, the lack of a vegetable in an entree seems a bit odd to me, especially when they give you literally a huge pile of potatoes to make up for the tiny meat. The crab cake was small but good, a bit overly seasoned so you didn't get the flavor of crab very much. The steak was very tiny, which I was expecting. Again, it was alright. Not amazing. For dessert I had chocolate cake. It was subpar at best. They didn't even heat it up. For a $35 dinner at a nice restaurant I would think you could pop the chocolate cake in the microwave for 10 seconds at the very least.  After tip we spent around $90 for two people for mediocre food, albeit great service, everything came out very quickly and our server was very nice. We didn't even order any drinks, a simple glass of wine started at $11. I think this restaurant could be decent but they are just greatly overpriced and that hurts them. I wouldn't go back.",

And the Coffee Rubbed Delminico (Boneless Ribeye) with Ancho (Chile) butter was THE BEST restaurant steak we've ever had! The char of the steak, soft medium rare middle, and the slight kick from the Ancho butter: OMG!  What was a great addition to a perfect evening was Ben the server. Knowledgeable, professional, and a great conversationalist. The runner (brought the food) and busperson were also great to interact with. Ask for Ben and tip him well!

It seems on par with other nicer steak places in pricing and (like the others), I think it is worth that price for amazing food sometimes.  If you're looking for a great steak, this is a very good choice. It's a great choice for a special dinner. The service was amazing and the food was wonderful. I can't think of anything else I could ask for in a restaurant. The toppings (crab cake & sauce), side (smashed potatoes), & crab bisque were all wonderful, too. A lot of steak restaurants get the steak right, but not the rest of the meal. My dining companion and I both thought the prices were appropriate for the quality of the food and service.  Ditka's is not an every day restaurant, but it's great for special occasions!  Side note, there is NO entrance on Steubenville Pike (I had to make a u-turn in the snow, since I didn't realize that).",

It's a typical steakhouse, with a limited menu focused on steaks, a good wine list, and high prices. We didn't get steaks, choosing the single crab cake dinner with brown rice and coleslaw. The crab cakes were excellent, slaw pretty good, and the rice was dry. The server was efficient and professional, and bold, recommending a $130 bottle of Chardonnay. I was somewhat flattered that I appeared to be able to afford such a bottle, but couldn't bring myself to indulge. Relative to the other upscale steakhouses (excluding from consideration Morton's, which is a temple to waste, excess, pretense, and crude conspicuous consumption), Ditka's is in the bottom half of the league in terms of the overall experience, but also at below average prices. If you're west of the city it's a good choice for dinner, but not a destination in itself.",

The staff went above and beyond in preparing a gluten-free entree of the pecan-encrusted mahi...then overcooked it to the point of being dry and tough.  The presentation was gorgeous!  Coconut sticky rice was a perfect companion for the fish, but the sauces were far too sweet and cried out for acidity to balance the sweetness.    The hubster had the prime rib, which was fine, too.  Again, not outstanding, but fine.  He enjoyed it and the baked potato, too.    Finished off with a fine creme brulee, but the two tiny raspberries perched on the top might as well have been skipped.  Maybe I've been spoiled by creme brulees with big gorgeous assorted berries elsewhere, who knows.  The custard was smoothly rich and wonderful, but the bruleed sugar was overbrowned (almost burned) and far too thick...had to use some real power behind the spoon to crack that baby!  The best item of the night was the Bloody Mike, but even that has been better on other occasions.  Might just have been an off night.",

    "text": "Within less than 72 hours, I ate at Ditka's twice while on business in Pittsburgh. And both times, it was soul-touchingly AMAZING! Tuesday I had the crab-stuffed shrimp and scallops with asparagus. While the seafood here is fresh (any fresher and it would've swum it's way down my esophagus) and paired well with the pinot grigio, I want to share my experience with the pot roast nachos. Why? Because I'm a simple girl that finds the most joy in the simple things of life.   Within 5 days, I had the best and worst nachos I've ever had in my life in Pittsburgh. Needless to say, Ditka's was the site of my nacho zenith. I showed up after watching Alice in Wonderland 3D (absolutely alone in the theater, no less). I'd seen the pot roast nachos on the menu two nights earlier and knew I had to have them before I left the area. I had the tavern size of the nachos (1/3 smaller and cheaper than what's listed on the regular menu) and the cultural cuisine amalgamation of American pot roast and Tex Mex nachos was sublime. When Sandy (I'll tell more about her later) brought them out, they were beautiful to behold and even more exquisite to consume.   Shallow pools of perfectly melted warm cheese united the thin, crisp, tortilla chips together. The chips were dotted with sliced green onions, jalapeno peppers, quaint smatterings of sour cream, succulent diced tomato, and fork-tender shreds of pot roast. The smaller portion was just right. It was sufficiently satisfying yet not overwhelming. I would likely have died from eating the full size portion size portion solo as I'm verily sure I'd have simultaneously experienced alpha and omega and simply ceased to exist.  As I said earlier, I'd comment on Sandy later. Sandy, simply put, was an angel. I was undecided between two beers and she let me try a sample of both. She not only gave me silverware in a cloth napkin, but prepped my eating space with a napkin to cover the raw bar wood. Like an angel, she knew when to check on me. She didn't hover like an overprotective mother or let me suffer like an tough-love one either. She even took the time to introduce herself and find out not only my name but my purpose in town. Fantastic service indeed!  I highly recommend Ditka's as the place to go when you're in Pittsburgh. Though it's not in the main city (closer to the airport), the restaurant's service and food are endearing ambassadors of the city and not to be missed (just a note, there are only 2 other Ditka's and they're both in Chicago, though I can't personally vouch for them and the one here is definitely a highlight of Pittsburgh!)",

It tries very hard to be fancy - from the decor to how the food is presented, but it's really nothing special. I got the Steak Diane (or something like that) and it was two small filet's in a mushroom sauce with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Now I didn't expect the filets to be large..or even medium sized, but I could have cut each of them in half and been done in 4 bites. And I understand that asparagus is more of a garnish, but they seriously weren't big enough to stab with my fork. I spent more time chasing them around the plate to scoop them on a fork than I'd like to admit.   It was pretty good food and since it's on the company, I might go back for something else, but I'd never spend my own money here. I'm sure there are other options around here that are focused more on the food than aesthetics. I know I'll be checking around.",

I ordered the crab cakes and the goat cheese salad. Best crab cakes I've ever eaten. So moist, high quality crab, and actually jumbo sized. The goat cheese salad was also a great size and I enjoyed the balsamic dressing. Husband had a steak which was cooked a perfect medium. He's super particular so that was a relief! He wished he ordered onions or something on top of his steak but didn't want to spend another $4 for a topping.  We also had the loaded baked potato which was well seasoned and perfect for sharing. I finished off my meal with a light and sweet creme brule and glass of pinot. It's not an every weekend type of place (can easily spend $150+ on dinner for two) but is a great quiet spot for special occasions. We will definitely be back!",

The server was pretty cool because she suggested the soup of the day for an appetizer. It was some lobster something but i couldn't remember but i wasn't a fan of it. I tasted it and when the waiter came back, she asked if i liked it which i gave her an odd look like it was ok. She told me to be honest and i said it wasn't my taste. So she took it off the bil which is really cool because i know in other restaurants, they wouldn't do that. I wish they had Ditka's closer to SF Bayarea.",

    "text": "Came here for the first time for lunch.  Ordered their seafood cobb salad.  Was around $18.  Friend ordered a wedge salad and their orange salmon entree.  Total came out a little under $50.  What's Hot - Layout.  It's more upscale than I anticipated, but it's very nice.  There are tables and booths and everything is evenly spaced out, which is not crowded.  It's not very bright inside with fluorescent lighting, which I appreciate.  More importantly, this place isn't loud and doesn't play loud music.  The ambiance is more intimate. - Quality of food.  The seafood cobb salad came with lump blue crab meat, 2 large shrimp, small scallops, chopped up boiled egg, half an avocado, bacon pieces, and grape tomatoes.  The salad dressing didn't overpower the flavor of the seafood and salad.  Good amount of all ingredients, although I would have liked more shrimp.  Haha...  At least they were the jumbo shrimp.  The seafood was natural and flavorful, not overpowering and didn't have a bad seafood smell.  My friend has dietary allergies, so she requested specific ingredients be taken out and/or swapped out for her dishes.  They obliged and my friend enjoyed her food, as well.  - Menu variety.  It looks like there is something for everyone, which is nice.  Not a large menu and not overwhelming. - Service.  Pretty good.  I arrived before my friend and the hostess seated me first.  She also took down my friend's name so they could keep us together when my friend arrived, which I definitely appreciated.  The hostess also accommodated my request for a booth.  They catered to my friend's dietary needs, which was good.  If you have leftovers, they'll put in a take away container without you having to ask which is also helpful. - Portions.  Decent size portions, but don't expect to be full on one dish. - Price.  Pretty reasonable, given the quality and portions.    What's Not - Service.  No bread served before the meal.  To be fair, I'm not certain if the restaurant generally doesn't serve bread of maybe they don't serve bread during lunch.  After we paid, my friend and I stuck around a bit and chatted.  However, the wait staff left us alone after we paid.  No one came to refill our glasses of water and check in on us.  I've been to restaurants where the wait staff will check in on you after paying the tab and at least refill water glasses.  To me, that's the mark of excellent service.  I appreciate it more when service continues after the financial incentive may be over.  After all, isn't it possible we could change our mind and still order?  Different strokes for different folks, but that's me. - Price.  There are definitely pricey items on the menu, especially when it comes to steak and seafood.  The portions aren't huge, just moderate.  This restaurant seems to be a place you go to for special occasions and not so much for a \"just because\" reason.   Final Answer Willing to come back, but more so for special occasions.",

Yesterday we stopped in for Mother's Day Brunch and got lucky with a table reservation that had canceled just as we got there. They kindly filled us in that spot, as they had previously been booked for the entire day. So glad we decided to chance it! We had a fabulous meal here! We started with $5 mimosas and pot roast nachos. The nachos were incredible! The flavors were on point! I had the crab and avocado omelet with breakfast potatoes, family had the chicken and waffles, ham and cheese omelet, and chicken salad with goat cheese and all kinds of goodness. Everyone loved their food! One thing I really appreciate is that their breakfast items are not greasy. The potatoes and omelets leave no grease behind on the plate and have a really clean flavor! Most breakfasts I order out just seem plain unhealthy in comparison to what we got at Ditkas!  My family wanted to try some deserts so we got the coconut cream pie and banana cream pie. Both made in-house.. both exceptionally go  The atmosphere is very classy but not stuffy. All of the servers are kind and top notch customer service from everyone in the house. I'm happy to know of another breakfast/brunch spot in the Robinson area!!",

    "text": "Took my husband and family here for Father's day brunch. Reservations are a must when you have a holiday so I had made one through Open Table.  They had a good selection of breakfast items but since it was mid afternoon we all went with the lunch since of the brunch menu. I had the salmon with red quinoa and broccolini, my husband had a single crabcake with brown rice and coleslaw, my daughter had a burger with fries, and my son settled for a plate of mixed vegetables.  Ditka's is primarily a steak place so they don't accommodate vegan too well. The vegetables on the menu are sauteed in a garlic sauce but the staff was willing to accommodate my son but serving them freshly cooked. They do have a vegetarian option which is a cooked pasta. I did not get to inquire about gluten free.  Our waitress was very accommodating and attentive to our needs. My salmon seemed a little dry but the touch of lemon on the side perked it up a bit. I truly enjoyed the red quinoa with those added pineapples. It added a \"pop\" of flavor to it. I also found the broccolini very tasty. My husband enjoyed his crab cake meal. What really looked delicious was my daughter's burger. That I could have really gone to town on. The portion was huge so she asked for a take out container. They combined about 4 vegetables for my son and I got to sample his Brussel Sprouts as well as an asparagus, and a red pepper. All were cooked nicely but since it was  prepared plain they tasted the same way you would if you steamed fresh vegetables you would purchase at the grocery store. Nevertheless, I was pleased with my sampling his meal and found them enjoyable. He too was unable to finish it all so he took the rest of it home.   Everyone seemed pleased with their meals and it makes a great place to go for a holiday or special occasion. The place does get crowded during those time frames but they have plenty of parking in their own private lot.  Located in Robinson plaza as you turn off Rt 60 towards the mall of Robinson, it sits right at the corner of Rt 60 and is easy to locate.",

The bread before the entree is great as well. The fries are not really crispy and some are saltire than others, but the taste was good. The only thing that didn't impress me was the coleslaw, which is rather plain. All in all, the experience was good.  I would recommend friends to try it.",

    "text": "Ditka's is the best steakhouse I have found in Pittsburgh so far. I actually ate here two nights in a row this past week. I was with a group of six and four. Both nights I ordered the seafood tower, which has really delicious shrimp, also has crab legs and oysters. They vary the size based upon your numbers, luckily I ordered extra shrimp because we went through them fast. We also ordered crab cakes which were very good.   The wedge salad has a really good blue cheese salad which I got both evenings, and will next time too.   I had two very different steak experiences first night I ordered the Paddle steak which is a large bone in Ribeye. I asked the server for the garlic crust topper option. He warned me it was very overbearing and recommended not getting it but I decided to try it anyway. It's not a crust it's a pile of garlic smeared on the steak. I scraped it off but think I could have killed a vampire. It was my fault he warned me. I said to a friend earlier that day you can never have too much garlic so I figured I would try out my theory. I was wrong lol.   The next night I ordered The Delmonico steak with the coffee rub and it was truly incredible. Perfect crust and wonderful flavor to my medium rare steak.   The lobster Mac and cheese is a great side too. Also try the cheesecake for dessert, they had a turtle cheesecake that was truly incredible. Also had a good wine menu, the Faust Cabernet was really enjoyable.",

This is a squeaky clean property but I'd never sit my shopping bad with food in it on the floor. Perhaps they should invest in some knee high stools to sit the bags on. The scallops were delicious. We loved the martinis and bought memorabilia shot glasses. The ambiance is cozy and intimate. We had no issue getting a reservation. It's been a while since we dined here but will surely come back. Any restaurants that split the crab legs for you is ok with me. I'll be back to try more menu items and this is a restaurant I certainly recommend. Parking is plentiful and it's close to everything in Robinson Township. This is a great place for special occasions. My birthday dessert was outstanding. Rich chocolate cake is always a winner.",

We made a reservation online which was extremely easy. Upon arrival, we were instantly sat then greeted for our drink order. The place started getting very busy but the service was outstanding the entire time. I enjoyed a mimosa and the berry crepes. There were three crepes stuffed with fresh berries in a cream sauce. They were good but a little on the dry side. My mom and my friend both had the eggs, breakfast potatoes and breakfast meats. They both raved over the flavor of the breakfast potatoes. I would return for breakfast in the future to try another of the entree options.",

    "text": "So returned back here for a work team dinner and wasn't super hungry so got a trio of small plates instead. However my co-workers were brilliant about sharing so got to try a bit of their food too!!  I ordered the Broccolini ($7.95), the Burgundy Mushrooms ($7.95 and watch out - these were very drunk indeed!) and Mike's Salad ($6.95 and consisted of pecans, goat cheese, apples, dried cranberries, balsamic vinaigrette, mixed greens). I also asked for extra goat cheese and was charged a $1 for it. Of the above 3, the mushrooms were my fave, and I actually ate these with the goat cheese. Mike's Salad for my taste, had waaay too much vinaigrette - I would have appreciated some restrain on the dressing. The Goat Cheese and Roasted Pecans were delish tho'. The Broccolini ate a bit dry and had this lemony- tart sprinkle on it - but that sour lemon taste wasnt consistent and I tasted it randomly.   From my table mates, I tried the following:   Jalapeno Hash Brown ($7.45) - The hash brown was a bit bland, even if cooked very nicely. Couldn't taste the Jalapeno at all! Overall just eh and wouldn't get it again.  Sherry Crab Bisque - I had loved this soup last time, but this time it was just so heavy on the cream and sherry, the taste of the crab was lost...such a pity this time didnt taste as good as on previous visit.  Mashed Red Skin Potatoes ($5.95) - DELICIOUS!! Creamy with a bit of textural roughness from the skin. Loved the taste and would get again.  Lobster Ravoli ($30.95) - So that parmesan-sage cream sauce went down a treat when combined with the Broccolini. On it's own it was a bit too heavy. Also could have used a more generous helping of those baby tomatoes to undercut the richness. Overall liked it, so wouldnt mind getting again.  Manchengo Chicken ($23.95) - Tasted too heavy for me, and I found that breaded and fried chicken to be too oily for me. Liked the basil cream, wish there'd been more. Probably wouldnt get again.    Our waiter and service was fantastic! I'd come back and try other things on the menu when in town again.   PS - so this would have been Yelp 65/2018 in the normal course of things, but I don't count reviews of repeat places in my yearly total - only new places are counted towards my list!",

It was acrid; it ruined the flavor of the steak with poisonous notes... speaking with the manager, he told me our waitress should've informed us that it's the standard practice to completely burn the exterior of the steak (excuse me, I mean, \"char\"). Apparently this \"locks in the flavor.\" So there I am, wondering two things:  1. Maybe I'm just not cultured enough and this is a popular method of serving steaks I wasn't aware of, as I'm trying to choke down charred flesh, or;  2. Were the chefs in Ditka's corporate kitchen smoking pot when they came up with the idea of having their restaurants serve their steaks in this manner?  I don't blame the waitress, the cooks, the manager; I blame the corporate office for green-lighting cooking this in their 1,500 degree oven and serving it ash-tray black as a default.   To his credit, the manager apologized and offered to cover the cost, even complimentary beers and desserts. I never accept these because of fear of retribution from the staff (not knowing that I don't blame them).",

Food was excellent. The drunk people outside the front door left a bad taste in our mouth though. Abusive, drunk and smelled like MJ . Called the manager from our car to complain. Ugh. Probably should not have served sloppy drunk people.  You still get 4 stars though. Expensive but worth it. I'd go back.",

We then got our crab bisque, also wonderful. The wife got the crab cake dinner and I got the 16 oz prime rib. Both were great meals, the crab cakes were delicious and the prime rib was a perfectly cooked medium rare. We also shared the a la carte smoked gouda mac and cheese, which is a must. So good!! Will definitely be returning.",

We started out at the bar and they do not have too many beers on tap, but they did have Yuengling and Sam Adams Octoberfest.  I was pleased to see both of those on tap.  We had to wait a bit for a table, but it wasn't too long.    Our table started out with an order of the bruschetta for an appetizer.  It was a slightly different bruschetta as the bread had melted cheese and it was drizzled with a balsamic dressing.  I'm not the biggest bruschetta fan, but this was decent.  I also ordered a caesar salad pre-meal.  I'm a huge fan of having a salad pre-steak because I feel like it almost cleanses the palate.  The caesar salad itself was nothing spectacular.  In fact, it was pretty ordinary.  Very similar to what a lot of chain restaurants to serve.    They've got a great menu.  I knew going in I was going to order a steak, but I wasn't sure which cut I was going to get.  I was deciding between their 10 oz Filet, the 16oz NY Strip and the Ribeye.  I decided on the Strip and ordered it medium rare.  We also ordered some sides for the table.  As an FYI, all the sides are served a la carte.  We went with some mashed potatoes, creamed spinach and asparagus.  I must say that the potatoes were very good, but the star of the sides was the creamed spinach.  It was completely over the top awesome and even came with some melted cheese on top which made it phenomenal.  I would highly recommend ordering the creamed spinach.  You will not be disappointed.  I was then served my steak - it was pretty freakin' awesome.  It was cooked absolutely perfectly medium rare.  It was incredibly tender and incredibly flavorful.  It was easily one of the better steaks that I've had in a long time.  I devoured it.  There was almost no fat on it which made it even better.  I also tried some of the Ditka's house steak sauce and that was very good, as well.  I know you're not supposed to use a lot of steak sauce on a fine steak, but I like adding a bit to kick the flavor up a notch.    Then...we ordered some dessert.  They had a pumpkin cheesecake and that is one of my all time favorite desserts so my mind was easily made up.  It was very good - and it was served as a circular piece which was different.  I'd recommend this also.  Overall, it was a very good meal.  Service was very good and it's priced accordingly for a fine steakhouse.  In my mind, the apps and salad are probably the only two things that prevented me from giving this place a 5-star rating.  If I'm back in the area and craving a steak, I'd have absolutely no problem coming back here.",

The ambiance was very intimate, warm, and inviting.  The walls are covered with murals and pictures of sports legends.  Mike's Salad was tasty and fresh - but really why order anything else?  You're here for the meat!  Mike Ditka's meat!  My mouth is watering just remembering the flavor.  In case you missed the point - ORDER A STEAK!  MEDIUM!",

My steak (half back filet) was good but not anything special; although the way they cook it did give it a bit of a crispy outside which was really cool. The sides were good but could be spruced up a bit. Overall highly recommend a visit (expect to drop a pretty penny).",

We ordered a great bottle of wine to go with our steaks. The steak was cooked to perfection and just how I like it; medium well. The red skin mashed potatoes were really good too. The hot bread basket....you'll want to have a basket to yourself because you will not want to share.

No regrets in ordering the filet and the sides were large enough to share.   I thought the staff was much friendlier than most.

After they left, I had heard this place was overpriced and not worth the effort, boy was I wrong!  I came here for a lunch on a Sunday, they were not very busy as at all, few guests rolling in.  We were greeted immediately and given our choice of seating, we chose a booth and sat down to look at the menus. Our waiter can a moment later, pleasant and friendly ready to get our drinks and made some recommendations. We decided on a bowl of crab bisque to start, I got the prime rib sandwhich and my companion got a salmon salad.    My first thought as I took a bit of my bisque, which arrived in minutes, very hot, is I immediately regretted not getting the larger portion. My usual main complaint about bisque is it's too thick like a paste or too runny like a broth. This was rich, creamy and seasoned to perfection, and some of the freshest crab I've had in the burgh. The second I put my spoon down and pushed my bowl to the end of the table, the waiter was on the way with our entrees.  My prime sandwich was perfect and I could see why it was such a popular item, mouthwatering, I'd highly recommend this.  As for the salmon salad, I have never tasted a salmon so crispy and full of flavor in my life, I'm not sure if this was flash fried or fully fried, but wow, just wow. Our only complaint was all the salad was drenched in dressing, a good one, but a little much, made it a very unhealthy salad.  Overall, amazing lunch, food was great and service did it justice. I will be back for dinner soon!",

    "text": "Wife and I had an enjoyable dinner there on Valentine's Day. My first drink was a Laphrogia (?) and water.  Didn't like it and the waitress said it was the bottom of the bottle.  She offered to get it from a fresh bottle, but I just changed my order.  Then, our first round of cocktails was very good, well poured and mixed very well.  And the Pot Roast Nachos were excellent.    The second round of drinks, however, we had to send back.  They tasted almost like they had changed bartenders and recipes.  But our waitress was more than glad to get them fixed, and upon return, we had a couple excellent cocktails again.  For our entrees, wife had a Filet Mignon that was cooked properly to her order.  It was however, maybe a little too lean.  It was tender but did not overwhelm with flavor as you would hope for at a high end restaurant.  But, I had the Kick Ass 20 oz bone-in Ribeye and my doctor is still yelling at me about it!!  It was flavorful, so moist, so tender, just so decadent, I'm sure my cholesterol went up 20 points as soon as it hit the table.  Absolutely delicious.  And I'm not much on mashed potatoes these days.  But what we had at Ditka's were awesome, it was hard to stop eating them.   And the wine that our waitress recommended (Keenan Cab) was very smooth and flavorful.  Overall, a very good dinner with understanding service.  We'll be back.",

This place has a cool decor, dark and elegant. Before I even sat down I was impressed by the service, I asked an employee where the bathroom was and they walked me to it.   So what did I eat? Started of with the calamari and it was seriously amazing, they were perfectly crispy and had finely chopped peppers on top, definitely a must try. Had to go with a steak sense I was at Ditka's so I went with the 10 oz steak and it was perfectly crispy on the outside and I had the twice baked potato that was gigantic seriously the size of a small baby. The potato was topped of with cheese and the inside was creamy and delicious . Of course I ordered my steak medium rare, I was a little disappointed that my steak wasn't bloody enough, but the second half was pinker. To top it off had a couple Sam Adam's October Fest beers, good times.",

Plus, we requested a booth.  And even with a full house, we got our booth.  For our server, well, he gets a star, but we won't go into farther detail.  They offered a shorten menu for the evening.  But it offered everything important.  For us, we opted to go with the dinner for two option.  This included a soup or salad option, a shared flour chocolate cake for dessert and a champagne toast.  For our meals, we both got a filet mignon with a lobster tail.    Let me just say, our meal here was amazing.  My salad was incredibly fresh, BJ's sherry crab bisque was the best I have ever had.  Both of our steaks was cooked a little bit less than how we had requested, but we didn't mind.  The flavor and seasoning was very good.  We also ordered a side dish, we got the Black Jack mashed sweet potatoes.  These was heaven in a small serving dish!  This is not a restaurant that we frequent.  But any time we have visited, we have loved it.",

Second time at Ditka's was on New Years Eve, 12/31/15.  A restaurant that performs well when they're incredibly busy is generally a good indicator in my opinion of how it operates normally. On NYE, they were packed. Out the door, piled up around the front of house. We made reservations. Our wait was roughly 15 minutes. The girlfriend and I sat at the bar and had a drink or two until we were seated.  Service was prompt and courteous. She had the filet and lobster tail.We started with the calamari appetizer. It was awesome. Probably one of the best I've eaten in fact. Not chewy. I had the prime rib. Prime rib was cooked perfectly. Her filet and lobster tail were also cooked perfectly. The prime rib was pretty stellar. Normally, I don't eat prime rib, but I figured I'd give it a spin. I was impressed. I also don't normally eat filet, however I had tried her's and it was excellent. Excellent enough that I intend to order one the next time we go. The lobster tail was cooked perfectly as well.  Sides were mac and cheese and asparagus. Both sides were hot. Very good. Normally I don't eat mac and cheese, but whatever their preparation is, it's great. Asparagus was a bit on the large side, however I expect that in the winter season.   I passed on the desserts, she had a creme brulee which looked very good. I went with a cup of coffee(Lavazza.)  Excellent experience at Ditka's. Wait staff is on point. Management is on point. Will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Ditka's had the worst customer service Sunday night that I have experienced at a \"high end\" steakhouse. We made an 8:30 reservation for a party of 7. When the reservation was made we were not told that they closed at 9pm. In my experience when a restaurant closes at a certain time such as 9 that means they stop seating guest at that time but they continue to serve the guest that have been sat. Not at this restaurant. Nothing was said to us as about the closing time as we ordered two nice bottles of wine and a seafood appetizer but as we were eating the appetizer our waiter came to the table and said that the restaurant closes at 9 and that they send the bartended home at 9:15 so it was last call.   We asked to speak to the manager because we had not even ordered dinner yet and felt like we should be able to continue to order drinks with our meal. While waiting for the manager the chef walked over to our table and asked if we were going to be ordering dinner because he had \"payroll in the kitchen that he was running up\". This is a 2 hour type restaurant so it is completely unreasonable for them to seat a party at 8:30 and expect them to be gone by 9 or even to necessarily have ordered by 9.   When the manager came over he offered no apology or resolution other than to go ahead and order any drinks we would like before the bartender left. This was unacceptable and as he walked away he was laughing and joking with the chef about it. At this point we paid for our appetizer and drinks and left. This is not the way a nice restaurant should treat their guest. The one high point was our waiter. He was obviously embarrassed by the way the management handled the situation. He was very apologetic and could not have been nicer even though he was losing out on at least a $300 tip.   On there website they state \"Ditka's Hospitality is what makes Ditka's a special place. The goal of our restaurant's staff is simply \"to have the guest want to return.\" They do this by making people feel welcome and cared for all the while looking for opportunities to create a \"Ditka's Experience.\"  They failed living up to this goal Sunday night. We were obviously an inconvenience to them and not welcome.",

So I really had no choice. This place chose me through divine inspiration.   I came in after a long 1 stop flight with crying babies and pissed off DINKS, which landed me in Pittsburgh. And I arrived hungry!   I entered Ditka's and was greeted by a courteous hostess and proceeded to bar area. Tabletops are walk in service and you just seat yourself. There are TVs in the bar area and they had on Game 3 of the MLB playoffs between St. Louis and Da'Cubs.  The Cubs were smacking it to the Cards pretty hard so despite being in Pittsburgh, the crowd respected Pittsburgh born Ditka's second home, Chicago, and let out many cheers and applauds. In my opinion, Ditka's is very much a gentleman's steakhouse, but with the class that a lady can be with her man and feel respected. The atmosphere is dimly lit candle light tables and the decor is dark wood and leather.    After I sipped a much needed beer (Yuengling, of course). I looked over the menu which was pretty impressive. This place has it all and I was pretty impressed with the price point considering the type of food that was offered. I am a pork chop lover and they had one that I saw served next to me, and I knew I had to try it.  It was a Double cut Berkshire with a spiced Apple chutney and mashed sweet potatoes.  I ordered mine to temp (medium). When it was served to me I cut into the center and instantly knew it he been overcooked. I tried it just to be sure and it was definitely well done. The server came over and asked if everything was ok. I politely told her it was overcooked.  She looked at it, and without even the slightest negativity, kindly apologize and said she would be back with a properly cooked order.  I continued watching the game and a few minutes later she reappeared with a new plate, and this time it was cooked perfectly.  I devoured this and was very happy for speaking up, because I was looking at a years worth of TMJ therapy had tried to chew the first one they sent out.  Mistakes will always happen but it's how a restaurant honors those mistakes that define them.   Ditka's is a solid place and I hope to be back one day.",

    "text": "Another great meal and experience at Ditkas.  We sat at the bar since we didn't make a reservation.  This time I had the twin filets and crab cakes while my husband ordered the ribs.    Initially when I saw the portion size of the filet and crab cakes, I thought it seemed a bit small, but when trying to eat it, I could only eat one filet and one crab cake and gave the remaining to my husband.  I ordered the filets well done and they were still melt in your mouth tender!  The crab cakes were perfectly seasoned.    All in all, another fantastic meal and experience at Ditkas.  I think this may be our go-to for fine steak dining!",

The burgers were woefully underdone to the point of uncooked despite being ordered medium.  Based on their prices it has fallen below it's previous standards.  Hope they improve",

    "text": "Huuuuuuuuge disappointment !!! Hosted a private event for 16 guests. I was given a choice of several dinner packages ranging from $47 and up to close to $100 per person.  I selected a lower end package keeping within budget. We were served a salad which was a plate of iceburg lettuce and nothing added to it, a filet, mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables (asparagus). The filet was waaaaay over cooked, the mashed potatoes were boring and dry and the asparagus had zero flavor, seasoning or sauce. Since we were looking for a sreakhouse, sadly Outback would have been a better option. Much more quality meal than what was served at Ditkas. PS: The triple chocolate was no show stopper either.... Basically a dried out etamins cake. Paid a hefty price for a bland and boring meal.  No thank you.",

    "text": "Great steaks!. The side potato is Ditka size! Of course the steaks are expensive, but they are very good. So good that even the filet mignon my wife ordered well-done was still very tender and full of flavor (I am a rare steak fan so that is saying a lot)  They have a great lunch menu with items pretty much the same price as Red Robin, but much much better quality. The burgers are very tasty, and their ribs are awesome. I also liked their fries. The staff is also very nice and attentive.",

    "text": "I organized a business lunch here since it was close to our customer's office.  They are unable to seat more than 8 people in the dining room so our options were the bar or a private room.  Thankfully it was not too loud in the bar but the service was slow.  We put in our orders and it seemed to take a while before any of the food showed up.  My salad with salmon was pretty good - nothing remarkable.  Apparently the steaks and other entrees are their strong suit.  The prices were reasonable and everyone seemed to enjoy their meal.  I think I would need to visit again for supper to truly evaluate this restaurant.",

    "text": "Went here for brunch prior to a bridal appointment. Was not crowded at all and we were seated right away. Not much selection on the brunch menu but we both found options we really enjoyed. I had the eggs Benedict fillets which were fantastic. Steak was perfectly done as requested and the eggs were good with nice runny yolks. The potatoes that came with it were also very tasty. It is a little pricey for my tastes, but for a nice meal and change of pace it is completely reasonable. And this isn't one of those expensive tiny food places, you get a good full plate. Our server was friendly and helpful, he checked in on us a lot without being overbearing. Will be coming back again.",

I will not be returning to Ditka's anytime soon, if ever.",
