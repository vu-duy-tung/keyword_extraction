Amanda told me that my daughter would be texted to come to the reception area of dorm to pick up a birthday treat on her birthday. Instead, she received a phone call the DAY AFTER her birthday to meet a guy in a white car in front of a different dorm on campus. She was alarmed and embarrassed but left class with a male classmate to escort her to the stranger's car. Not at all the lovely surprise I anticipated for my girl her first month of college!!!!",

They serve pastries, breakfast, lunch, and (if you're familiar with Pittsburgh coffee) la prima espresso coffe which is to die for. Everything is made on sight, and absolutely delicious. Also, as a broke college student, this cafe is quite reasonably priced. The staff are very helpful and friendly, and the atmosphere is very quaint. The croissants are some of the best in Pittsburgh. Deffinitely my new favorite cafe!",

How fantastic is this! For years I've been saying there needs to be a late night bakery cause sometimes you just need a cupcake after a long night! I digress. We orders the salted caramel, the peanut butter chocolate (I forget the cute name), and the chocolate covered strawberry. I was able to talk people into splitting the caramel and strawberry with me so I could try them both and thank god! The chocolate covered strawberry was delish, just a tich sweet for me but still fantastic. The cake was rich and fluffy an the buttercream was smooth and flavorful. Not to mention it was loaded with yummy strawberry filling! The salted caramel was heaven. Seriously heaven. The caramel filling, the chocolate cake, and the caramel buttercream with caramel drizzle, and then those little bits of Black Sea salt! Oh lord they were fantastic. I'm sad that I didn't get to try the chocolate peanut butter, but I did snack a milk chocolate salted caramel candy for the ride home and it was divine! The caramel was smooth and creamy, absolutely fantastic. I just wish they were so much closer to home but I'm sure my waist line is thankful for the distance!",

Amanda's shop is adorable and her chocolate selection was equally impressive.  We each got a cupcake and two chocolates.  While the cupcake (chocolate salted caramel) was quite possibly the best salted caramel I've ever had in a cupcake I was blown away by the chocolates.  If you're ever in the area or in search of a good chocolate bite, I highly suggest the orange truffel as well as the ginger/cardamom.  I can't wait to go back!  I LOVE to see local shops do well in Pittsburgh.  Go here for your next sweet treat!",

    "text": "I came here for a Yelp Meet the Business Owner event yesterday.  I was really impressed with the quality of the chocolates and cupcakes that Amanda, the owner, makes.  I sampled one of the orange flavored chocolates, and it was delicious, esp. with some champagne.  I also sampled one of the mini-cupcakes, and filled and decorated my own large cupcake.  Amanda makes all of the cupcakes, fillings, frostings, etc. herself, and they were all delectable, not to mention adorable (though her decorated cupcakes are prettier than mine!).  Finally, I tried some chocolate fondue with fruit and pretzel dippers, and it was absolutely delicious.  Amanda was also kind enough to make some fresh-squeezed raspberry and mango lemonade for us, which she also sells as a refreshing treat.  She mentioned that she is in the process of acquiring an espresso machine and developing a pastry menu, so it looks like she will have some breakfast and tea-oriented products soon.  Although Amanda's products are more expensive than those of some other places in town, it's very clear from their appearance and taste that they are very high quality.  I was extremely impressed by all of the creative ideas Amanda had for her products.  The cupcakes and chocolates would make perfect favors for a wedding or baby shower, not to mention excellent Valentine's Day gifts.  Additionally, having a cupcake decorating party or chocolate fondue would be a great idea for a little girl's birthday party or a bachelorette party, and it was a lot of fun when I tried it!  I was also impressed to hear that Amanda gives back to the community by giving away her older cupcakes for homeless children's birthday parties.  It's very clear that this business is a labor of love, and that Amanda takes great pride in it, so support her by trying some of her wonderful confections!",

    "text": "I've tried several of the cupcakes which I can't stop myself from inhaling as soon as I get home.  I had the chocolate with a gorgeous pink icing and filled with a jam which was cherry?  Not sure- but the jam was a lovely surprise.  Love, love cupcakes with a surprise in the center.  I've also tried the lavender icing-delicious as well as any cupcake drizzled with caramel-amazing how a drizzle can have so much taste impact on the ol' taste buds.  I tell everyone how good these are.  The latter 2 I mentioned were not chocolate-I always eat a chocolate base and yet these were supernal.  A dream.  And on Saturdays, you want to get there early because those little gems disappear rather quickly.   So why 4 stars instead of 5?  Only because they aren't huge (which is good for the waistline and that's what I tell myself every time I feel any residual guilt.)  And they're a touch more expensive than I'm accustomed to in NYC.  I had a favorite cupcake shop in NYC that just closed overnight even though we all thought it was a successful enterprise (perhaps lesson learned there).  But whatever.  If you're a cupcake aficionado and you've been to Manhattan you know Magnolia supposedly has the best--well, they pale in comparison to these.  They can't hold a candle next to Le Petite... Also, everyone there, and I mean everyone is so friendly and pleasant it is a joy to go there.  I wish they were open on Sundays too.  So run, don't walk, and spend lots of money so they are around for a long, long time-or else you'll make me weep.",

We were greeted with a table of ornately decorated chocolates and a case of cupcakes with frosting as big as the cake.  There were also samples of the ginger rose chocolates.  While we sampled, the owner, Amanda, was so nice and talked with us for about 15 minutes about her shop, her plan to introduce more cupcakes, and her chocolates.  Right now, she only has a few cupcake ingredients, but in a week, they're hoping to have a rotating schedule.  She uses real butter cream frosting and each cupcake is filled with a creamy pudding-like filling.  Sadly, I gave up cake for Lent, so I have to come back in a week to taste, but my first will be the peanut butter chocolate.  Or the mango peach.  Or the lemon lavender.  Or....  We did try more chocolates, though.  While we were there, only dark chocolate was available (no complaints here!) although Amanda does offer a selection of white and milk chocolates.  I got the cherry with dark chocolate and le-BF enjoyed a sea salt caramel with dark chocolate.  Amanda uses fair trade cocoa and natural, local ingredients.  They are so rich and satisfying, you only need one.  That's why the French eat like gluttons but are rail-thin - they use quality ingredients without waxes or fillers, so you're satisfied with one..although with all of her flavors, a small sampler box is probably worth it!  Do yourself a favor and stop by.  This is definitely worth a trip to the Southside.  I have a feeling I'll be updating my review to 5 stars after I try the cupcakes (only reason why I didn't give full stars - I can't report on those heavenly-looking cupcakes).",

    "text": "Wednesday was my dad's birthday, and I had decided last minute that I wanted to get him some sort of sweet treat! My husband and I checked out several bakeries on Yelp, but as it was already after 6pm, most of our options were closed.   I was excited to discover that Le Petit Chocolat was still open. I got to the shop and couldn't believe how tiny it was. The shop owner just has one tiny little refrigerated case for cupcakes (probably 40-50 were displayed) and one small counter with display cases for the chocolates (maybe 50-80 displayed here).   I took 4 cupcakes and 4 chocolates to go and brought all the goodies home to my husband and parents. Now, keep in mind that my cooking/baking specialty is cupcakes and that I'm a certified cake decorator. Usually, when I try a cupcake from a shop, I think that I could bake something better. That was not the case here. I tried both the Salted Caramel and Apple cupcakes, and they were out-of-this-world delicious!! The Salted Caramel had the best chocolate cake that I've ever eaten, and trust me, chocolate cake can be tricky to make. It was rich and moist and not at all dry or crumbly, which is how many chocolate cupcakes taste. This cupcake was injected with thick, rich, homemade caramel and topped with an incredible rich and fluffy buttercream and salt. The Apple cupcake was just as delicious. The same incredible buttercream topped off a cupcake that had an interesting shortbread consistency (like nothing I've ever had before) and a dot of apple filling inside.   I'm crossing my fingers that I may stumble upon some leftover goodies today at home but know that I may not be so lucky. I definitely want to go back to this shop sometime very soon!",

Because I'm so used to disappointment, I tend to go into new cupcake experiences with very low expectations.  Especially when it's nearly 10PM and I stop into Le Petit Chocolat for the first time with some friends after a show at the Rex. The cupcakes certainly had The Look -- the frosting was vibrant and smooth with a nice height, and the flavor combinations were a mix of classics and adventurous without being ridiculous.   I bought the Plain Jane and Strawberry Shortcake, even though I wanted to buy them ALL. And after splitting these two with my son when I got home later that night, now I'm sorry that I didn't buy them ALL. These were some damn fine cupcakes, you guys. The frosting was on point and the cake was moist, yet firm---there's such a fine line between \"Betty Crocker\" and \"day old cornbread\" when it comes to cupcake texture. I liked that these cupcakes didn't come off as \"trying too hard\" -- they shine in their simplicity. And considering I bought these 10 minutes before closing time, I imagine that an even fresher batch would bring me to my knees.   I just went to Le Petit's website and saw that my favorite flavor combo is available: lemon lavender. I live way too close to this place. This is about to get dangerous. (And I haven't even tried any of the chocolate yet!)",

    "text": "Solid 4 stars for their cupcakes!  I tried the lemon lavender cupcake which was a vanilla cupcake with lemon curd filling and lavender frosting.  The filling and frosting were incredible!  They went really well together - the tartness of the lemon filling with the floral/sweetness of the frosting balanced each other out.    The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was because of the cake part of the cupcake.  It was a bit dry and wouldn't stand alone very well without the deliciousness of the filling and frosting.",

I visited this cute little store along Carson Street right after lunch and was pleasantly surprised!   A few people were in there eating sandwiches (they looked yummy!), while I waited patiently to order.  For 3 dollars (a single cupcake) it's on the pricey side, but less than specialty cupcakes you buy in NYC or Philadelphia.   I tried the Strawberry Shortcake cupcake. Strawberry buttercream, vanilla cake, AND a strawberry filling. The cake was moist, crumbly and not too sweet!   The baker also carefully packaged the cake in a window pastry box, giving it a nice presentation.   Next time I would like to try their chocolates though! The case was empty when I visited around 1 in the afternoon.",

You can order paninis and other sandwiches as well as chocolate flavored drinks. They also have candy for sale. On a shelf they serve all types of delectable goodies. As far as pastry is concerned you are not limited to chocolate. They have a nice variety of cupcakes, scones, cookies, and different types of pastries. Still reeling from my lunch I opted for their chocolate chip cookie and a cranberry scone to take home with me.  They served me my cookie on a china dish and gave me a bag for my scone. The place is neatly laid out and they have a few tables you can sit at. The cookie was fluffy and moist. I really enjoyed eating every bite of it. I learned also they sell chocolate chip scones but will try the cranberry one for breakfast tomorrow. They only had two types of cupcakes left when I was there. One was chocolate with a caramel drizzle icing and the other red velvet. They sell for $3.00 each. Next time I will indulge in one of these.  Prices are very reasonable for lunch which warrants a return visit from me to try out one of their sandwiches as well as dessert! Can't wait to come back here. It is located near a pay parking lot which is city metered near the Birmingham bridge.",

But product availability can be incredibly frustrating and inconsistent.  On three separate occasions, I've stopped in at 10:00 or 10:30 am to grab cupcakes on my way to a meeting, and to my surprise, they've had zero cupcakes available for purchase.  (Unfortunately, it happened again today).  I understand that she makes cupcakes fresh each day - that's one of the things that makes them so good - but if a business opens at 9:00 am, customers expect product to be available at 9:00 am.  It would be unfair of me to complain with out attempting to be constructive. With that in mind, I'd like to offer the following ideas/suggestions: * Perhaps she can start the baking process earlier, so that product is available when the business opens. * Maybe she can consider baking tomorrow morning's inventory the night before. * She could clearly set the expectation that cupcakes will not be available until a specified time, while all other goods are available for purchase starting at 8:30 or 9:00 am.  Or, if product won't be available until 11:00, then perhaps they shouldn't open until 11:00 am.",

She is warm, friendly,  knowledgeable, and genuinely committed to making sure each customer leaves happy. Count me in.  She patiently explained about all their goodies, drinks, etc.  My first was the Cerise truffle. It was absolutely scrumptious to this nonchocoholic. The ONLY reason I didn't have another, was I calculated how many hours of figure skating it would take me to offset 1 truffle. At only 5'2\", I have to reign myself in. No one wants to see a jigglefest on the ice.  The truffle was a rich, decadent, moist , with a perfect balance of cherry taste. The cute decorative top was artwork defined.  I ordered a currant scone. I had a couple bites, and saved the rest for Daughter.  Grudgingly. Currants aren't something you often see, so I wasn't passing this up. The scone was just as scones should be, with a generous helping of currants. Perfectly  baked.  I told Amanda to surprise me with coffee, just make it half decaffeinated. I got Sumatra, one of my favorites. It was perfect with the scone.  I took a orange citrus cupcake to go. Amanda's husband called her to frost them after he was done baking them. Totally worth the wait. I again, shared with Daughter. Grudgingly. The texture was coarser than Graham's Bakery cupcakes. This was a tiny bit drier, a bit crumbly, and delicious. Delicate, faintly sweet, orange flavor. Complemented nicely with white tea.  I will be back, chocoholic Daughter in tow. Grudgingly.",

Pick from an array of different fancy pants french chocolates, or try out their new cupcakes. At $3 a pop, they're not cheap, but look like a decent size compared to other unnamed cupcake shops around 'tahn. Plus, the icing is light and fluffy and so is the cake. Just the way I like it. I tried the strawberry cupcake, which had homemade strawberry filling. Deeelicious.   The outside looks totally unassuming, and I had mistakenly thought it was a new business, but came to find out they've been open for about a year! So don't just walk by next time, stop in! And you can thank me later.... with a peice of chocolate!",

    "text": "I was happy to stop by Le Petit Chocolat on a Sunday afternoon with a few other Yelpers and friends to meet the owner Amanda and enjoy some tasty treats.  As always, I was not disappointed.    Amanda clearly knew how to win the hearts of Yelpers - sweets and alcohol!  We were offered chocolate fondue, mini cupcakes, chocolates and cupcakes we could fill and design ourselves with a variety of options.  She also provided fruity refreshments that of course tasted better with a little champagne.    In between sweet bites and fruity sips, Amanda told us how she and her husband have expanded their business.  It started with chocolates then moved on to cupcakes.  Now they've added coffee and espresso.  And always offering quality products.  A few pastries are also in the works and there was talk of discounts when purchasing quantities - potentially even preferred customer discounts!  She's game for any kind of special requests if she can pull it off and welcomes private parties with chocolate fondue or cupcake decorating.  Her enthusiasm is impressive as is her success.  Maybe one has led to the other?  My friend ordered a sampling of the cupcakes on our way out.  And because \"it's the end of the day,\" Amanda threw a few extra cupcakes into her box.  What a sweet ending to our visit!",

Amanda and her family deliver on it all! The cupcakes are filled and delicious. The chocolates have converted me. I will never eat regular chocolate again! (Welll lets not make promises here we cant keep) but seriously the chocolate is unlike any I've ever had! The soups and sandwiches are amazing. Never had a bad thing. My favorite soup was the African Chicken soup uhhhh-mazing! Sandwich of choice either the spinach,egg&cheese on a croissant or the gourmet grilled cheese are so good! Coffee is perfect. Just everything about it is top notch. If you are a southsider and never stopped here do yourself a favor and give it a shot. I promise you wont be disappointed.",

You can tell there is an immense amount of love, care, and attention paid to detail. This has carried through into the reopening of La Petit as a cafe now with breakfast sandwiches and panini now.  This truly is a family cafe, everyone is friendly and the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. We tried the Caprese breakfast sandwich this time on English muffins and it was delicious. I will Definitely be back, this is a local favorite of mine that I definitely want to see succeed in south side!",
