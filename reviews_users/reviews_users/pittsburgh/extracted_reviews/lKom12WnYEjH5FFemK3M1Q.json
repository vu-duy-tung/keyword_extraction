A must for anybody visiting Pittsburgh as this is something you can only get here",

    "text": "Soooo disappointed!!   After hearing about Primanti Bros from everyone that has ever stepped foot in Pittsburgh, I made a point of going to the original location and having the \"Pittsburgh experience\". I had visions of grandeur...  My boyfriend ordered the pastrami and I ordered the Pittsburgh \"cheese steak\" which is totally misleading, but the waiter explained what it was, and I LOVE egg on my cheeseburger so I was all in. I don't like coleslaw, but I thought, \"No, you have to have the whole experience, get it with coleslaw\".  In all fairness, the coleslaw was the most flavorful part of my sandwich. I pushed it off towards the end though because I couldn't taste anything else. The pastrami sandwich was slightly more flavorful, but not much.  I've been there, done that. I don't need to go back. The owners are some lucky lucky people... Fill sandwiches with cheap fries and coleslaw instead of meat, don't worry with washing plates or the expense of paper plates and make lots of money. All the hype keeps them in business I guess.   Thank goodness I saved our trip to Fat Heads until the end of the trip. They renewed my faith in Pittsburgh food!!!",

We visited the location near Pitts campus and thankfully we made it in before the students came back for the semester.  The only NEGATIVE we had about the place was it was so cold I didn't even want to stay for another round of drinks. Because we were there before the busy season there was only one other table there and the wait staff was very attentive to us. She was super friendly and gave us the run down on how the sandwiches are made. I wasn't that hungry to get a full sandwich so I settled for the terror tots, delicious!! For some they would probably be too 'hot' but for me, the spicier the better! Another thing I loved about this place was their draft beers came in 2 different sizes! Will definitely return the next time we are back in Pittsburgh.",

We ordered two different kinds and split them so we could try as much as possible. The fries tasted like the oil hadn't been changed in weeks with a weird kind of burnt flavor soaked into them. The meat was fine and plentiful but nothing special. The coleslaw that everyone raves about is not really unique or special... just less creamy than most are used to.   Overall it's pretty cheap and easy for an on the go lunch or dinner, but it's just a sandwich and there are many other places I would choose to eat in the future.",

But it is iconic and has a unique charm to it. Nice servers, fast service, and reasonable prices give it a lot of positive reviews as well.   If you're expecting a culinary masterpiece go elsewhere. It's more of a novelty with a pretty good taste and incredibly fresh bread.",

Now granted I can't fault a place for being busy, but the whole time we were there, there was always a line of about 5 people or more out the door, and they literally had a packed house with 3 people working, total, including the cook.  Now granted, the food was OUTSTANDING as we predicted. My girlfriend saw this place on the Food Network, and I grew up in and around \"The Burgh\", so this wasn't my first time here, but I hadn't been in about 5 years after moving to California.  We were not disappointed taste wise, as everyone knows about this place. But again, I really wanted to put a 5, but with the wait, which for us was literally 20 minutes, an extremely solid 4 is the best I can do.",

    "text": "This place was the only reason I was looking forward to my business trip out to Pittsburgh.  I heard Ed Rendell make mention of Primanti Brothers when he first became Governor of PA.  Ever since then, I've seen it on Food Network, the Travel Channel, Destination America....I was craving one of these sandwiches just from the description.  Finally, 10 or more years later, I have the need to travel to Pitt. for business.  I started doing my research on Primanti Brothers, their location, which one is the original, what type of meats are in their selection.  I was working up a panic thinking about whether or not I should try the pastrami.  I've never had pastrami, but am not a big fan of corned beef.  I started asking friends what they would do and alot of them said they love pastrami.  They also love corned beef.  What to do, what to do???  As soon as I got off the plane, I headed to the original, in the Strip District.  The mean lady I saw on TV was there.  She made my sandwich!!  Under pressure to hurry and order (not by the staff there, I just had to get on a conference call in 15 minutes) I went for the pastrami.    When I got the sandwich, quickly, it was picture perfect! I smashed it down and dove in.  The combination of everything was really really good and I was glad I got the pastrami.  It turns out that there's no mayo in the coleslaw, but vinegar and maybe a little oil.  That counteracts the saltiness I was expecting from the pastrami.  The fries didn't seem to be salted either.  God, that was a good sandwich.  Definitely go here and def get the pastrami.    Giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because, well...it's no cheesesteak.",

The sandwich is great but then again it's a sandwich like any famous sandwich it gets over hyped. Is it great, yes... Will it change your life, no.

Personally, I want to try the sardine sandwich just to say that I ate it.)  On the plus side, the slaw is really good - nice and tangy.  It's better than most of what I had in the South where they take great pride in their slaws.  Again, this is another Pittsburgh place that doesn't take credit cards.

I'm not kidding. as most things you do in pittsburgh, it goes well with iron city beer or any beer at that. the sandwiches have fries, tomatoes and slaw on it. and its yummy. the chili cheese fries are just greasy yummy.   straight off, i'm a bit of a food snob. but i respect food that has somehow been able to help you understand the city's history and the people. i would suggest having a primantis at the end of the night of going out, or right before you go and do some sight seeing of the city. this city has an amazing character and great history in the hard working men and women. and primantis is what these people eat.   go steelers.",

We had heard about this place and seen things about on TV and we felt we couldn't pass up the opportunity since we didn't know if we'd ever be back in PA. It was one of the best detours I have ever taken!   We'd been on the road for hours so we ended up stopping in at about 11pm on a Wednesday. Thankfully they're open 24hrs. We ordered a corn beef sandwich and a cheese-steak. The sandwiches are beautiful-if you're into overflowing goodness of fries and slaw. Unfortunately the guy got our order mixed up with someone else's and we ended up with a ham sandwich, not the cheese-steak. We were really looking forward to having a real cheese-steak since we were in the area. Alas, not to be. But our sandwiches were awesome and I just wish I could have try another...",

    "text": "What can be said about Primanti Brothers? It's open 24 hours for one thing! Finding late night food in isn't easy. I ordered the Pittsburgh cheesesteak - their best seller and enjoyed it thoroughly. I normally despise coleslaw, but the Primanti employees were insistent it was different than any slaw I've tasted before and when in Rome, do as the Romans. I admit, I actually liked the slaw on cheesesteak, on fries, on fresh italian bread combo. Not as good as a Johnny's cheesesteak in Philly, but unique in its own way and worth a go.  The downside? Somewhat sketchy neighborhood at night. Armed guard at the door, some dude getting pepper-sprayed in handcuffs just a few doors down. And if you don't drive yourself there, good luck getting a cab. There were cabs in the area, but if you aren't going out to the burbs, they won't even pick you up. Pitt has a cab shortage and they are picky as hell about who they pick up and where they'll go. It isn't a reflection on Primanti Bros, but a general warning for those looking to venture down there late night.......make sure you have a lift home.",

    "text": "A lot of times, superior experiences will immediately hit you over the head with how awesome they are. You knew after the first time that you beat Super Mario Brothers or touched a boob that something pretty spectacular had just happened.   Primanti Bros wasn't quite like that. I saw the sandwich on TV and built expectations up insanely high. Upon arrival, we noted that the restaurant itself had a pretty cool set-up with the long diner-style counter... they served beer... they had plenty of hot sauce... all great news. But the cheesesteak was... different. The meat was more like a run-of-the-mill hamburger puck, though on great bread with a variety of glorious non-traditional toppings. The fries were a spectaular sandwich addition, and the slaw was not at all like the usual gag-inducing mayo-heavy concoction. There was a whirlwind of emotions and analysis as the sandwich and my expectations came to terms, then it all sunk in-- it was damn good!!-- and by that point it was gone.   I had another each night for three nights, and by the end of the third, I was furious that I had to leave Pittsburgh. I had only tried the cheesesteak and there were so many other sandwiches to try! The cheesesteak was great, however-- a real trendsetter. Sure, the Southside Slopes at Fat Heads is a phenomenal sandwich, but you couldn't enjoy one every day like you could a Primanti Bros sandwich, and that's part of the charm. The other part is that you can't get these sandwiches anywhere else (outside of Ft. Lauderdale, but who's keeping track?). That makes for one damn charming sandwich experience. Bon apetit.",

The wait staff seems poorly trained and experiences a lot of turnover. This results in poor service, long wait times, and inaccurate orders.  Many locations seem to be in a state of chaos while dining there ( poor management).  I have also experienced bread that definitely seems 1-2 days old.  Unless you order double meat on your sandwich you'll mainly be ingesting a coleslaw and french fry sandwich.  The too rapid expansion of this restaurant has resulted in reduced quality and service.  There are so many pizza/sandwich restaurants in Pittsburgh that a basic search will surely turn up a vastly better option for your dining experience.",

I know I walked in at 10 PM, but it's a 24-hour joint so what gives?? The floors were DISGUSTING and full of old cabbage and other food particles everywhere. The tables were dirty, but less than the floor so I was definitely better off eating off the table. The sandwiches come wrapped with no plates, etc., which is probably part of the problem. The whole place is messy and disgusting from start to finish.  Also, I'm sorry I don't like the sandwiches, but I don't. They're so, so, so dry. There's a little bit of meat and cheese (like three slices of meat?) and the rest is just fries, bread, and coleslaw. The coleslaw does not have enough vinegar to cut through the dry fries and dry bread. Eating my sandwich felt like a chore, but I was so hungry that I powered through it with the aid of a lot of ketchup.  I guess it's nice that the sandwiches are so cheap, but I sure see no reason to ever return.",

    "text": "This is the third time I've been to the original Primanti's.  I give stars for the character and history of the place.  I've never been impressed with the food.  This last time I came into town with two Texans.  All three of us ordered the burger - which according to the menu is the #2 seller (#1 is beer - I asked)).  The Primanti's gimmick is that things that are normally sides - like fries and coleslaw - are piled on the sandwich.  Somehow this is supposed to make the sandwich better.  None of us finished our burgers. and it's not because we were full. I stopped halfway.  Texan #1 could not stand the vinegary slaw and said it made him want to throw up (his actual words, and I honestly think he was serious).  We wrapped it up so he didn't have to smell or see it.   My opinion of the burger is that very little about it worked, down to the bread and meat - though I actually liked the vinegary slaw. li think I would have liked it even less had I not ordered the fries to be not placed on the burger. The last time  I ordered as the menu states - all those ingredients make it impossible to get all the flavors in one bite, meaning in one bite you might get fries and slaw, then in another get meat and slaw.  As busy as this place is, I'm surprised those fries don't come out piping hot.  We sat at the counter and watched all those orders go out.  My fries were good, but if they had been hot I think they would have been amazing.  If you're from out of town, do the touristy thing and visit the original.  Check that off your list, but I'm guessing you'll not feel a need to return.",

We arrived during the noon hour on a Saturday so it was a very busy time with the line stretching outside and a bit down the sidewalk. Luckily the line moved quickly and we were seated in about 15 mins.   This place was recommended by a good friend of ours and she specifically said have the cheese steak. We're from Maryland so when we hear cheese steak or steak n' cheese we think Philly style or something similar. Well we were not informed of the local Pittsburgh custom or perhaps more specifically that of Primanti Bros. All sandwiches are topped with slaw and fries (as clearly noted on the menu) and I was okay with that and ready to try something new. However, when the sandwiches came out the cheese steak (aka The Pitts-burger on the menu) was salisbury steak patties and the angus steak 'n cheese was angus beef chopped up. Hmmm.   After being surprised at not seeing a more traditional steak 'n cheese/cheese steak and getting an explanation of what we did get from our server we dug in. Unfortunately we were underwhelmed. Sigh. No particular flavor was evident in the meat or sandwich and the slaw didn't add anything special either. We just didn't get all the hype. After I added salt, pepper and ketchup to my sandwich that helped but still all in all not what I expected or hoped for. Maybe we just weren't ready for this Pittsburgh experience.   Our service was good though and because one of the orders was wrong it was comped. We appreciated that. All of the staff were very friendly too.  Sorry - not a fan of the food.",

    "text": "I was recently in Pittsburgh with a friend and we were told we should try Primanti Bros.  First thing we did after checking into our AirBrB was go here.  We were prepared for this place to suckkkk because you know how it is when places get hyped right.   I was actually pleasantly surprised at my experience.  My meal was definitely good and resulted in the toughest decision I've ever had to make about rating a place 3 or 4 stars.  Continue reading for more details.    We got there on a Monday afternoon and it was packed out.  Service was slowwww as hell because it was so busy.  I asked the dude for his recommendation and he said go with the Pastrami.  I was like aigghttt.  We also got an order of Chili Fries.    Damn, the Chili fries kind of suckeddd.  The fries were aight but the chili was like mad watery and just didn't go well with the fries.  The chili needs to be thicker and meatier for the fries to soak up.  The sandwich was pretty huge (we didn't order double meat) and was interesting because it has a bunch of stuff in it, like fries and coleslaw.  The coleslaw was surprisingly really good.  Honestly when I looked at my sandwich, I asked why there was so little meat on it.  But when I bit into it, it was sufficiently meaty.  Could have used a bit more though.   I don't remember how much I paid but I think it was like $8 a sandwich and around $4.39 for the chili fries.  I might be wrong though.  All in all, I really enjoyed the sandwich.  It stood out nicely even with the negatives I mentioned so far.  As I pondered my rating, I concluded that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts in this case.  If I go another time, I'd probably order another sandwich (without fries) and ask for double meat ($2 extra).    On a side note, Pittsburgh as a city kind of sucks.  We went on the dooshbag incline, which was pretty aight.  The Cathedral of Learning was the best part of our trip; that place is gangsta.",

    "text": "Apparently this place is a must have in Pittsburgh. I ordered the hamburger. So let's break it up step by step:   1). The was nothing special. It tastes like something you would get at a super market.   2). The French fries in the sandwich were too soggy; definitely not worth the calories. I ended up taking out all of the fries from the sandwich. 3). The meat was great! I truly enjoyed the softness and flavor. I added an egg to my burger and I enjoyed the enhancement. I am a huge egg lover!  I did not get the Cole slaw that comes in all of their sandwiches but apparently it is significant. I do not like Cole slaw one bit. So maybe I did not get the full Primanti Bros experience. But I am still giving 4 starts since I really think they did a great job on the burger patty.",

Don't mess with her.  There's nothing tastier (imo) than the Pastrami & Cheese...  The Capicola probably has the most meat for a regular sandwich (& it's good too)...  BUT If you're hungover, the fried bologna is like medicine! It's a tried-&-True cure to the dreaded HangoverTM. Kinda bland in flavor though, so I'd recommend a dash of hot sauce.

You find all sorts of people here, all in the mood for a stomach busting sandwich with your favorite meat, french fries, slaw and two big pieces of bread.  It was not as crowded today as expected, so we were able to get a seat at the bar.  Our servers were extremely prompt and efficient.  Sandwiches were great today. I had the Jumbo Baloney (one of my favorites).    I always recommend to tourists to try this place as it is a long lasting tradition.

The fries by themselves might be a little dry. There is a lot of food in one order so arrive hunger or be prepared for leftovers. On busy days there is a doorman directing attendees to open seats, otherwise it is sit yourself. The chili cheese fries are also great! A Pittsburgh iconic restaurant.",

Perfect, you're in luck because Primanti Brothers nicely fits the bill.  I give them credit, Primanti's sandwiches have become synonymous with Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh fare.  They've done a great job promoting their little empire of eateries.    Unless you grew up in a cave, you know the components:  your choice of meat/cheese with a layer of vinegary cole slaw and handful of fries between two generous slices of Mancini's Italian bread.  The sandwiches are OK, and they are not inexpensive, most are about seven dollars.  The slaw and fries make up over half the filling, and the bread gets soggy.  Service is consistently gruff/brusque.  I'm sorry you work in a dive, working the line and putting handfuls of slaw on sandwiches, but don't take it out on me.  If you are coming in from out of town and want a great Pittsburgh sandwich, I would not recommend Primanti's.  Go to Tessaro's or the Smallman Street Deli or the Thin Man Sandwich.  Less hype and much better sandwiches.",

The roast beef sandwich was piled mile high with meat, coleslaw, and the crispiest darn tootin' awesome french fries you've ever had.

The staff was super nice & I even got a chance to say hi to the nice lady who is on all the food shows when they visit Pittsburgh.  Primanti Brothers is a cool place to park the car, grab a bite and take a walk to all the different stands on the surrounding streets.   As far as the food goes I wasn't disappointed but I wasn't impressed either.  The sandwiches were just, OK.  The bread was freshly baked, the cold cuts were good but I guess what didn't do it for me was the cold soggy bland under cooked fries they crammed in the sandwich.  Now if your gonna have a sandwich as simple as that without so much as some mayo or some kind of dressing everything needs to be money.    Any time I'm in an area where I can grab a cold Yuengling beer & some homemade chilli cheese fries (ironically enough our fries for the appetizer were cooked to perfection) I'm a happy camper.  I'm glad that I got a chance to cross Primanti Brothers off the list and would suggest a visit if you have never been and your in the area.",

The atmosphere of a True blue collar bar offering a True blue collar sandwich paired with a tasty beer did make up for it though. Overall a decent sandwich with a great Pitt atmosphere but the sandwiches are nothing to write home about.",

I put french fries whenever I have burgers in SoCal (like In-N-Out)... but, the sandwiches here ALREADY HAVE FRIES IN THEM! Best freakin' idea EVER. The cole slaw in it is good, too. The bread - I don't mind it, but it's just soft, white bread... it gets soggy quickly... might be better toasted. But regardless, it's good stuff!   The service is alright. It gets packed often, so you can't really expect A+ service. Your food may take a while, it may take a while to even order, but it's definitely worth the wait.  I love the jumbo fish sandwich! Definitely must try to pastrami. Must go again soon to try everything on their menu!  Has been and always will be on my list whenever I'm in Pittsburgh. =)  Go Steelers!!!",

We waited on a Saturday for only 5 minutes and our orders were immediately taken. I ordered the pastrami sandwich and about 5 minutes later it arrived at our table. It was salty and delicious with the fries and slaw on this large sandwich. The slaw was my favorite part. I could have eaten a large bowl of just the slaw. The only critique I have of Primanti Brothers is that their fries could stand to be a bit saltier. Other than that this is a great establishment with quick service. Just remember its cash only!",

Once seated, we waited for several minutes before anyone came by to ask us anything. However, after the first staff member showed up, another two came by within two minutes to ask us for our order as well.   The food was okay, nothing spectacular. The one interesting part was that the fries came stuffed in the sandwich. As for the taste, really nothing out of the ordinary.  Why this place is so popular will remain a mystery to me.

The place was so busy that it was hard to find somewhere to sit. Another plus is it's open 24 hours. If you go to Primanti Brothers you have to go to this one. This is the original one.

I went with the #2 favorite Pittsburger (still couldn't find the #1 favorite anywhere on the menu) and it was solid. To be honest I was expecting more but it was not a bad sandwich. The coleslaw they use tasted like there was too much vinegar which kind of threw me off; I guess I'm used to southern slaw after going to school in Richmond for 4 years. Also, although the fries were good and looked great when they are put in front of you they definitely tasted undercooked and were kind of soggy. The bread was also just regular thick white bread and nothing special, while the burger patty was definitely no Kobe beef. I think the hype of the place makes everything taste better than it really is. If it wasn't so famous they probably would be just another hole in the wall.  Oh yea, Cash Only!",

I got the roast beef, and my beef was really tough, and the fries a tad bit on the mushy side. The beef was seasoned nicely however, and I personally enjoyed the cole slaw. I was also hoping for a bigger beer selection, which they did not have.. We opted for the local Iron City lager..Which was just OK...

These are among the best sandwiches I've ever had, anywhere, period, and I say that as a Clevelander who would normally die before praising anything about this town.  Fries in the sandwich make it special but everything about these sandwiches are scrumptious.

The combination of delicious sandwiches covered with their homemade fries and slaw, make this a great place for lunch or dinner.  If you aren't heading downtown, don't worry, there are many Pirmanti locations around Pittsburgh. Although I definitely would suggest going to this location, definitely has the best inner city vibe around.  Whenever friends or family visit Pittsburgh, they always want to visit Pirmantis and I agree. Check it out.",

It was basically a coleslaw sandwich on trailer trash while bread. The meat (pastrami) was paper thin and the fries were soggy, cold, and basically uncooked.   Word of advice - skip it!!! I'd recommend Fat Heads. At least you get something tasty there and great beers to boot",

The meat and cheese were delicious, I LOVED THE COLESLAW, but the french fries were just a little too much for me, but OH WELL! I pulled those babies off and scarfed down the rest in two sittings because the sandwich was just too damn big....#firstworldproblems. Overall, I can't wait for my next experience, I'm going to hold the fries and enjoy the rest! So delicious, you cannot come to Pittsburgh without a Primanti's sandwich or what's the point??! ***Afterwards, I picked up some new Steeler swag at the shop next door! Primanti Brothers for the win!",

The beef patty taste not real beef. It's a street food level with strong chemical smell. I am aware of the sandwich will be a layer of fries in the middle. The fries is oblivious OVER COOKED and no flavor. The only highlight thing for the sandwich is the fresh tomato and bread.   PS. When you sit at bar. If there is an old lady offering you some random Greek dessert, please don't buy it for your own good.  She said its one dollar each; but rather she took two dollars and one dollar for her 'tip'.",

The bread was cold and it was waaaaaay too much cold slaw and French fries. The hot sausage was not even mild it had a pickled taste.

    "text": "I've noticed that many, if not all, of the negative reviews here are from foreigners (would you really trust their opinions on what a great American sandwich is?), tourists whining about bad service/ambience, and the refined palates out there lol. Listen, it's a sandwich shop. A greasy one. If you wanted some gourmet experience, you could've gone down to the Capital Grill. This is a gritty little eatery in a gritty city, so appreciate it for what it is and its historical significance. And for Christ's sake, give the people that work here a break. It's hot in there and they're hustlin for you. They don't care about your beaming smiling touristy faces and your cameras and how you can't wait to try what you saw on some TV show.  Back to the food...so far I've had the capicola and the pastrami. Capicola is sliced on the thick side (I'm more of a fan of the thin sliced Italian style that I'm used to in NJ/NY) so I'm partial to the pastrami. Double meat this bitch up. It's top notch. The cole slaw is fantastic, vinegar not mayo, adds the perfect crunchy bite. Fries are not crispy, but they're great on the sandwich itself. The bread is just ok, it's holding all the good stuff together.   Somehow when you put everything together, something magical happens. It's def worth a try. Avoid the lunch crowds. Open 24/7. Bring cash and leave your \"I'm the customer and I demand stellar service\" attitude at home.",

Unfortunately, none of orders had cheese on them like we had ordered. The sandwiches were piled high with cole slaw and some fries, but on the bottom of the sandwiches were exactly 2 slices of meat (pastrami & bacon) and tiny patty (Pitts-burger).  Being from Brooklyn, NY and used to having MEAT on our sandwiches, we were very disappointed.   I will say, the cole slaw was very good. The tall mug of Bud Lite draught was very good.",

    "text": "I am a Pittsburgh native who comes to Primanti's *maybe* once a year when I'm doing my holiday shopping in the Strip. It's always about 90% tourists when I'm in there, and I'm unsurprised to see that the reviews are also mainly touristy types. I think many people have a fundamental misunderstanding of what a Primanti's sandwich actually *is.* Their cheesesteak is not at all like a Philly cheesesteak (God forbid!) and the meat in general is weirdly ersatz, with some selections usually not seen in a modern restaurant setting (knockwurst? whatever the burger patty on the cheesesteak is made from?) Primanti's originated as working-class trucker's food, designed to be held in one hand while driving (hence the purpose of having the fries INSIDE the sandwich and the 'round-the-clock hours). So yeah, there's something a little gimmicky and passe about it now, particularly when they have a location in Florida and everyone and their mumma is making a \"Pittsburgh style!\" sandwich. But it does have its origins in the Rust Belt, slap-it-together-and-make-it-work culture that makes Pittsburgh unique. IMO it's worth it just to stop in and experience, if only for the 15 minutes it takes for them to make your sandwich and you to eat it, some truly vintage P-burgh culture.  So how is that mystery meat on the sandwich, in this townie's opinion? Well...it's pretty good. I actually like those weird burger patties and sometimes crave them when I'm not at home. The sweet sausage and kielbasa sandwiches are also pretty excellent. Don't drink an Iron City (it's disgusting for real) and have a Yuengling instead. Have a boilermaker if you're feeling especially touristy and ready to get drunk. Then stumble out into the Strip and enjoy your uniquely Pittsburgh experience.",

I had the pastrami sandwich and  I would have given this place (5) stars but they do not season anything.  I know that because I watched.  I think these days, with so much emphasis on 'no this' and 'no that', they leave it up to the customers to season for themselves.  Dude!  Look at the sandwich--it's not the salt or pepper that will kill you.  I am not a salt freak.  I hardly ever add it to anything, but  I do understand seasoning and why the best tasting food is cooked with butter and salt. I do have one observation, as delicious as these sandwiches are (after seasoning for myself) there is not as much substance (meat) as a NYC deli sandwich.  That is because the thickness of the bread (superb) and fries (delicious) and slaw( spectacular) leaves not much room for anything else. I loved this place, and would go back in a heartbeat.  The people in it were terrific, fun, colorful and the sandwich was delicious--but you need to season it with salt to bring out the True taste of how good these sandwiches are.  By the way.

They are open 24/7 and are located in an old part of Pittsburgh known as The Strip. It looks like a bunch of old warehouses have been converted to other purposes. There is metered street parking except parking is free on Sunday.  Though cold, it was sunny and lots of people were out and about.   Though crowded, I was seated quickly by a friendly staff person. My waitress took my order. I ordered a roast beef and cheese with everything and requested that it be toasted. A runner brought a turkey sandwich to me and I told her that was not my order. Then my waitress came over and apologized but then wanted to \"make sure\" that the roast beef was what I \"really wanted.\" There was a bit of condescension in her tone as if this old lady had ordered the wrong thing (they don't write down any orders). She got it right - except it was not toasted - and then checked on me after that. The sandwich was good. The fries are very good and I'd prefer them on the side, but then it wouldn't be a Primanti Bros sandwich.   The area is full of shops and it is next to a sports stadium. Lots of people were sporting Pittsburgh Steelers and Steelers gear. There are a variety of restaurants in the area. If you come to Pittsburg, I would definitely check it out.",

I know a lot of people think the fries are the secret, but it's the slaw.  That light and peppery goodness.  Good quality meats and cheeses.  All cooked to order and presented to you in minutes.  It's not fancy, but it is special.  It's not just the sandwich, it's the experience!",

I also had a previous review of one in Fort Lauderdale Florida which is great to have around the area, as an idea of what this sandwich is about but is nothing like the original...   The food we ate here is clearly a mark above, it must be the old location, the grill, local suppliers, etc, the french fries are just different than any place else... I highly recommend this place for breakfast and for lunch.  I had capacola with cheese and my girlfriend had Angus steak, absolutely amazing!!!  .",

    "text": "Primanti Bros  Highly heralded as THE sandwich place in Pittsburgh, we had to try it out and we went to the one on 18th street where there was a line out the door the day before. It's open 24 hours so the line wont be there all day.   Street parking makes it tricky if you want to pick up something  quick. One of us stayed in the car around the corner while the other went it to order to make it easier.  We ordered the burger cheesesteak with a fried egg and the roast beef with cheese subs.  The sandwiches come with fries IN the sandwich, and it is rumored that they get irked if you ask for them separate.   The white bread is soft and fresh on both sandwiches. The roast beef sandwich was better but was missing the cheese or we could not really taste it; next time we would ask for extra cheese to really taste it. The fried egg made the burger cheesesteak but still lacked any real flavor. While the ingredients are good and the flavor of the and portions are satisfying, their was a muted feel to both.  I think we need to give this place another try before passing final judgement but it was not as impressive as it was made out to be...",

All sandwiches are served with coleslaw, provolone, tomato, fries & your choice of meat.   Our server was a bit short at first. Seemed like it had been a long day & he was tired. He did end up being a tad nicer for a second but overall not the friendliest service but not the worst I have had.   The sandwich was ok. Not very much meat in it. I saw a sign that said double meat for $1.99. Might be worth it.   The fries were the best part to me. I could have eaten a whole lot of them! We asked for extra after our sandwiches came & they were brought out right away which was awesome.",

I also dined in this time as well instead of taking it back to the hotel. It definitely taste much better when you dine in. The sandwich isn't all smushed and everything is nice and hot. The fries on the sandwich tasted fresh and were very delicious. I still think the Cole slaw overpowers the sandwich but not to the point where you can't eat it. Overall a very delicious sandwich that I wouldn't hesitate to order again. The guys were all cool and welcoming. Can't wait to come back!",

Out of four waitresses who worked that section only one did not have a scour on her face. First time I tried Primanti and I agree with those who think it is nothing special. Throwing fries on a sandwich does not improve what is already a bland corned beef and pastrami sandwich.  After one bite I just took the now partly soggy fries and ate them separately. Tasted better this way.",

It was so good I could have eaten it all day long. It tasted like my Sicilian grandmother's soup. I also ordered the turkey sandwich and was surprised to find my cole slaw and fries in it instead of on the side, but it was fantastic!  The Italian bread it was served on was mouthwatering. This is a definite stop if in Pittsburgh. It isn't the location in market square. I went to the original location. Tony is a great conversationalist and a pleasure to talk to.",

I love the Pittsburger even though it's a different style of burger than most are accustomed. Also recommend the capicola. And my wife loves the bologna. Be prepared: the fries and slaw come on the sandwich, so sides are very optional. That also means most sandwiches are a great deal. This is a very Pittsburgh place, usually full of Penguins and Steelers fans and hard-working local people. It's a touristy spot, too, but that just means Primanti is spreading the love!

I write, fearing some drunken yinzer fresh off a Steelers loss may find me and beat me to a bloody pulp with a bar of soap wrapped in a terrible towel... I write... because I must.  I really don't like these sandwiches. I refer to them as garbage sandwiches. Oh I know.. it's a novelty because it has fries and slaw and tons of meat and lard bread.   The sandwich is too big for my mouth to bite into.  I get sneers and stink eyes when I remove the fries and eat them separately. I hate slaw. I hate mayonnaise. I don't care for the bread. There is too much meat on the sandwich. They ALWAYS put the god damn tomato on it even when you explicitly tell me no tomato. LISTEN TOMATO MAKES ME GAG. Those disgusting little seed sacs, BARF.  Sure this place is a great place for me to take out of towners. They marvel at the disgustingness that is american cuisine.  Bigger. Fatter. Heftier. Fuller.   This is great hangover food, in that throwing it up is easy. It's bland. It's white. It's bland white people food.  You'd think I'd love it, I'm the whitest person I know. But damn... give me some spices maybe a little schmear on the bread. SOMETHING.   The fries are not seasoned. The slaw is drippy and hard to masticate.   Oh please Pittsburghers, please don't beat me to death.  You can eat your big ass garbage sandwiches and I'll go back to my tacos.",

    "text": "Primanti's why do you LOOK amazing, but taste so sad?  This concept is genius, the execution is not. I am told, the idea behind it is that steel workers needed something grab and go so they would pile everything including the fries, cole slaw and deli meat in one and wrap it up for them.   Here's my problem with this place. Why is the bread plain fluffy, starchy, stale white bread? It's not grilled, or buttered, and I might even be okay with that, but the weird part for me is just that is it not quality bread. If you are slingin' sammies all day why not invest in some good locally made bread?    Fries on a sammie? YES PLEASE! I appreciate that they are hand cut. But mine were cold, sad and had absolutely no seasoning on them. It was like piling bland on top of bland.   Last but not least the burger was NOT a burger. It was almost like a fake piece of meat or a JTM. I could not believe this was the standard here, and what they were KNOWN for! And the pastrami? I guess I was expecting a slow roasted juicy, succulent pastrami. This was shaved razor thing, and it was served cold.   The pros - it's a tradition, and at least worth trying it to say you did it, and the concept is quirky and fun, but I just can't get over the execution and how low quality the ingredients used here are. Maybe they have fallen into the \"people will eat it no matter what stage\" and are ok with serving food like this, but that would make me really sad.",

Sometimes a deli type place doesn't have alcohol, they had a decent bottled beer selection, so +1 there...  As for the main attraction...the sammiches... We tried three of them...  All of them feature thick white/italian bread a pile of fries, a pile of slaw, a couple tomatoes and then you basically are just picking which meat you want to be under that pile...  Pittsburgher - the worst of the three, a very bad burger, I'd prefer a middle school lunch patty.  Jumbo (Bologna) - this actually went well with the pile of stuff and acted as a nice complement, If I was go come again I'd strongly consider this one.  The Capone- this had multiple different meats and was ridiculous just on sheer volume... It wasn't bad, but I'd never try it again...  So, if you've never been you should definitely go, it's worth it for the experience and sheer largesse at very fair prices, but I don't expect I'll hit it again unless I come back with someone who's never been....",

I took the fries off the 2nd half and I enjoyed it more. It seems like more of a gimmick to me. Worth every penny of the $11.65 I paid for sure. I'm super full and am in a great place. Now maybe my recent decision to give up red meat has hindered my choices on restaurant menus and perhaps the coleslaw/fry combination on a different sandwich would've gone better with perhaps their roast beef, pastrami or corned beef options.",

I travel 100% of the time for work with my team and we stop at amazing food places in cities across the country and this has got to be one of my favorites.    The atmosphere is super casual, seat yourself.  It's pretty small on the inside, so you want to show up before the lunch or dinner rushes if you plan to have a seat.  Also, not the best for very large groups unless you get there outside of the rush.  We had 7ppl, 4 sat at a table and the other 3 at the bar.  I sat at the bar and got to see both Nick (Chef) and Sierra (Server) at work.  It was just the two of them and they managed a packed house like a pros. As hectic as it seemed to me, they didn't miss a beat.  Not  one order was missed or made incorrectly.  They worked really well together.    My team got an array of items and everyone loved what they had.  I had the Ragin Cajun Chicken sandwich and it was fantastic.  Every sandwich comes with this super yummy cole slaw (made w/o mayo), French fries and provolone cheese.  The sandwich alone is more than enough food for one person, you may not want to order additional fries unless you're sharing.  The chicken had a perfect level of spice and it paired well with all of the toppings.  I will definitely be coming back for more the next time I am in Pittsburgh.",

The \"meat\" on the pittsburger was like a hamburger patty you buy at a discount grocery store's frozen freezer. Or it also reminded me of an elementary school's burger.   The bread was good. The pastrami meat was good. The coleslaw was OK -- but a too vinegary for my taste.   The sandwich looks awesome, but the taste of the bland, rancid peanut flavored fries turn it into junk.",

He was in Pittsburgh last month on a business trip and went to two other locations which he didn't care for.

It's the ultimate fat kid's dream - I know it was mine when I was little haha :P   So the thing is, it's pretty good, but not really memorable - after the first few bites, it's a little bland. The burger meat is decent but not tender, juicy, moist (etc) and the fries were underwhelming. The slaw is pretty good but just overall execution, was ok.   Service however, is ON POINT.   Am I deterring you from coming? On the contrary, you should visit for its local flavor - but split the sandwich to share to stuff yourself with something tasty later on.",

    "text": "I'm working on Pittsburgh Strip District reviews from my latest trip to the city last Tuesday, and by now it's no secret that businesses on The Strip are near and dear to my heart.  Primanti Brothers is no exception.  You may or may not know what Primanti sandwiches are all about--large inexpensive sandwiches composed of thick slices of soft French bread, some sort of meat and/or cheese, Italian coleslaw, and fries.  A liquidity factor on sandwiches is really important to me, and for this reason Primanti Brothers gets 4 stars rather than 5 stars; about half the time I visit I find that the coleslaw isn't quite wet enough for my taste.  Sure, I could slather some Heinz all over my sandwich, but then the sandwich flavors would be lost in exchange for the flavor of ketchup.    I've tried several different sandwiches over the years and have enjoyed them all.  They've got a ton of personality...well, as much personality as a sandwich can have!  If it's your 1st time visiting Primanti Brothers, then don't be shy about asking a server for his/her recommendations; they tend to be more than happy to provide their input.  The dirty old bathrooms are located down a steep flight of stairs on the dining area side that has the bar, but, you know, it just wouldn't seem right for Primanti Brothers to have shiny new bathrooms; the place is basically a dive.  Yum.  Primanti sandwiches are, in a word, satisfying!",

I sat at the bar area and after reviewing the menu went with the roast beef sandwhich.  And what a meal it was, not just a sandwhich but a meal.  As I sat there trying to finish the sandwich the placed cleared out to just me and the three guys working and wow again what great guys.  We talked sports and such and slowly the place filled back up to almost full.  They let me sit and watch the Pirates game and talked baseball.

We went for lunch, and it was generally busy. The hostess was very accommodating with our large group and seated us pretty quickly. Ordering is no frills; pick a \"base\" to your sandwich, and they're all served with fries (on it), slaw, tomatoes, and onions (if you ask). I ordered the turkey breast and cheese and it was pretty damn good. The turkey actually tasted like it had been hand carved. When the waitress brought our food out, I wasn't sure how we'd be able to eat it all; however, after a few minutes of eating in silence, the sandwiches didn't seem so big and we clearly didn't have a problem chowing down on them. Quick, no frills. It felt like kind of a heavy lunch but I bet this is the ultimate late-night, after-partying place! Would totally recommend for a one-of-a-kind sandwich.",

Can't miss with the Pittsburgher which is just your basic cheesesteak with all the good fixings. I love the closet fish. And honestly that is the only two things I order.

    "text": "From what I understand, the kitsch of this place it to be rude and have a bad attitude towards customers.  If I would have understood that before I went, maybe I would have been a little easier on the place.    I'm from northwestern PA, and over Christmas, my boyfriend and I flew back to my parents for Christmas from Denver.  Having never been to Pittsburgh, and being the foodie that he is, he knew he wanted to go to the original Primanti Bros.   I personally like the sandwich- give this Irishwoman corned beef any day.  Add some coleslaw and cram some fries between two slices of Italian bread, and I'm satisfied (and a few pounds heavier).  I like the history behind the sandwich- truck drivers who needed something quick to pick up and didn't have time to eat, got all ingredients wrapped in a paper and could be on their way.     It was really the atmosphere that threw me off.  Call me overly-sensitive, but when I go out to eat, I'd rather not feel like I'm a nuisance to your establishment and a bother for you to serve.  Maybe living out west has softened me, but you can expect that any server out here, whether they be working at a sub shop or upscale restaurant, will ask you about your day and joke around with you 99% of the time. So I was unprepared for the next hour that unfolded.      When we arrived, the two of us were directed to a large booth in the corner that could have sat at least 6 people.  Everyone, and I mean everyone- from the manager to the servers- were rolling their eyes and giving us dirty looks for sitting in such a large booth, but that is where we were told to sit.  Finally they made us move to a smaller table, and after we asked if we were causing a problem, the waitress stated, \"Just forget it, whaddya wanna order?\" Seriously, we overheard several waitresses barking to their tables and rolling their eyes to patrons while making snarky remarks.  One girl at the table next to us was just making a statement that she loved when the fries first came out because they're so fresh....and the waitress rolled her eyes and huffed, \"Oh, well then I'll make sure to get right on that, huh?!\" nastily.  Yikes.   You better know what you want immediately, because this is a \"hurry-up-and-order, so you can gobble-down-your-food and get-the-hell-out\" kind of place.  They really make you feel like you're wasting their precious time there.  I get it!! You have a lot of people to serve during your lunch rush- So do about 1,000,000 other restaurants, yet those places can do it graciously and make it appear effortless.  So we ordered quickly, the food came quickly, and we were eh. satisfied.   That's when the daunting \"CASH ONLY\" sign reared its ugly face.  Both of us rely on our debit cards and rarely carry cash.  Our eyes widened at the thought of what might happen.....Would they: A) Make us wash dishes?,Or, the more obvious option, B) Murder us right then and there? The ol' luck of the Irish saved my tail and there turned out to be an ATM inside.  We were saved.  After withdrawing a $20, we got our tab- which was only about $14.    We slunk up to the counter to pay.  The rudest waitress of all grabbed our check and $20 from us.  She gave us about $6 and some change.  I believe in leaving at least some amount of tip, no matter how bad the service is; because the waitress could have been a bad day, the poor service could have been someone else's fault, etc.  So as we go to hand back a few of the dollars, the waitress ripped and i mean RIPPED the remaining $6 out of our hands for the tip and sarcastically said, \"Thanks!\"  I certainly didn't want the tip money to go to her, as our main waitress was \"friendlier,\" if that's what you can call it.    Go here because you can't get the original sandwich anywhere else.  Go here because when checking out a new city, it would be atrocious to go to a boring chain restaurant, and it's always great to see what local places a city has to offer.      All-in-All, know what to expect when you go here:  1) Don't waste space at the table you sit at  2) Order quickly and act like a pro  3) Know that there are better sandwich places out there  4) Know you're going for the experience, for the inventive sandwich and the establishment's less-than-pleasant attitude and charm 5) BRING CASH!",

The quality of meat is just so-so and it is a little hard to follow the service model when you are a newbie. They will sit you down- the menu is on the wall. The sandwiches all come with meat, fries, tomatoes and coleslaw on the sandwich. You have to order pickles on the side for extra. Order, eat, leave. You will be stupid and eat the whole sandwich. Accept it. You pay at the big signs that say \"PAY HERE.\" Cash only.",

The sandwiches are wonderful.  We had the roast beef, ham and cheese steak.  All were great.   The combination of the fries, tangy coleslaw and fresh soft bread make a perfect sandwich.   I would have had a side of the coleslaw as ell, could I fit another bite in my stomach.   These sandwiches are massive by the way (although I don't think that is much of a secret)",

I went with the salami sandwich and was not disappointed.  All the sandwiches are served on italian bread with french fries and cole slaw on the sandwich.  I did have to deduct two stars because 1) I felt the quality of salami should have been better given that this is a place that serves almost entirely sandwiches and 2) the lil eco-friendly person inside me tinged with guilt drinking from a styrofoam cup.  I mean, even McDonalds stopped using that material in the mid-90s.  I was also seated next to the back door and it seemed as though a large bag of trash was thrown out once a minute.

    "text": "After reading this the people outside of Pittsburgh will hail me as their queen, and the people of Pittsburgh will want to wish I had never existed on Yelp, but I have to say Primanti Bros. is not living up to the hype generated by numerous segments on the travel channel and food network.   I can't spend all my time on this review as I have many others on my cross--country adventure to tend to, but here are the high- and low-lights of my Primanti Bros experience:  1. The bread needs to be much thicker and substantial to hold the massive toppings inside. I need something better than wonderbread here. 2. The amount and quality of meat and cheese were not bad - no real complaints here. 3. I really liked the coleslaw because it was vinegar based. 4. Um, yeah I'm aware that it would not be a Primanti Bros. sandwich without the french fries, but first, can the french fries taste good (they were stale, mushy and lacked salt) and second, can you not make the entire sandwich taste like potato and cabbage? not pleasant.  Well that's the 411 folks. I'll never feel the need to come back but glad I did try one.  Also, cash only and the poor service (we waited forever even though there was no one in the restaurant) are not helping.",

This time I got the knockwurst and again just an amazing flavor. I recommend getting there right at 11 am. there was a non-stop line from 11:30 til 6 pm when we left the strip.

The fries were very soft like they hadn't been cooked very well or had been allowed to sit around a long time.  There was a line to get in at noon on a Saturday. I much prefer a crunchy roll or slice of French bread, with any slaw on the dry side.  I like my fries crispy and on the side.

The food came out fast, the staff was very nice, but Primanti's just left something to be desired.  Maybe even though it was a mom and pop shop, it almost felt like a chain.

It's definitely an extremely casual place to eat at. The place was separated into two sections. Since the main floor and bar was taken, we sat at the back on the next room where they had the full drink bar. That was a mistake, the place reeked! There was trash all over the place. It seemed like we just came in right after they had a big rush of people, which is still not an excuse to have such a filthy environment. This is definitely not the place for germaphobes! Especially since they just serve your food on plain wrappers.   Okay, okay, aside from nit picking about the cleanliness, the food was pretty amazing! I had their jumbo fish sandwich and trust me, they do not kid around when they say jumbo. It was huge! Not to mention, everything on their board menu was affordable.  I wish I could say I had the same amazing review about their staff. The lady was just rude and slapped everything so quickly and spoke too quickly too. She seemed like she did not want to serve us at all. She didn't even give us our ticket so we could pay for our meals. We had to tell the cashier to ring us up. The cashier/bar person was pretty nice though. She had a heavy accent but tried to tell us about when the merchandiser guy would be coming by to sell t-shirts and stuff, since we had asked her about purchasing some as souvenirs. Just hope that the next visit here would be better.   Oh but I would say that you have to definitely try out a Primanti Brother restaurant at least once! It's a whole different world!",

We stood for about 15 minutes, then got seated. Not too shabby.  The place is small and cramped but not too bad.  A friend recommended I order the Steak & Cheese w/ an egg, so I did.  My wife ordered the fish, and my daughter got the ham and cheese.  The server brought out a side of fries, which were lacking salt... Okay, no biggy, throw some ketchup in the mix and you're good to go.  and for the sammys...  Now, I get the whole, \"I'm from Pittsburgh, I grew up on this stuff and it's best thing since indoor plumbing.\"  But seriously folks... THIS is what everyone raves about?  I mean, let's break the sandwich down.  Two slices of bread and in between, coleslaw, french fries, steak and cheese, and a fried egg.  Grant it, the combination is exquisite, however.  THERE IS NO SEASONING ON ANYTHING.  The strongest flavor in every bite was cabbage.  I wish I was kidding, but it was so bland that I had to drown it in hot sauce to at least get some kind of flavor to it.  My wife's fish sammy was just the same. We probably could have swapped and couldn't have told the difference.  We were both thoroughly disappointed and couldn't even finish it.  Actually, my daughter's ham and cheese was the most flavorful of the 3 items ordered.   In all, it was something that had to be tried. But to say this is a great sandwich, is a lie I can't pass along.",

Food episode of Pittsburgh(yes I do enjoy that show) I was thrilled when I went on a trip to Pittsburgh for a convention that is held there every year in the summer time.The friends who I was staying with made it a goal to go to Primanti during our visit and indeed we did. We decided on mostly the same sandwich all around which was the Pitts-Burgher Cheese Steak and their signature fries. We were not disappointed at all with the meal as it was tasty and delicious, although we may have needed two to fill us up! I'm usually not one for cole slaw or tomatoes but my sandwich alone was delicious enough to eat the entire thing!",

    "text": "The legend of Primanti Bros. and their original cart in the Strip District in the 1930's has been well documented - featured on no less than 5 Food Network programs the history of Joe Primanti and his hefty sandwiches loaded with fresh cut fries, sweet slaw, and plenty of toppings is perhaps the most legendary in the Pittsburgh dining scene.  Driving up from Columbus early on a Monday morning we decided to kick off our trip with the legendary (albeit revised) original location - a small bar on 18th Street, at the heart of the Strip District.  Arriving at 9am we arrived between breakfast and lunch and found easy free parking before making our way into the heavily wooded and entirely homey feeling bar.  Finding the location surprisingly empty (we were the only patrons) I was a bit put off as the two older ladies behind the register eyed us without saying a word.  Making our way further into the restaurant and chuckling at the legendary Pittsburgh caricatures lining the walls I rather guessed that the 24-hour nature of Primanti Brothers had left us with employees at the beginning or end of a shift as it actually required a concerted effort to place an order.  Not wanting to get filled up as we had a whole day of eating and museum hopping ahead of us we opted for a single sandwich and two \"pops\" to which our cashier stated \"is that it?\" almost incredulously.  Undeterred we sat down and waited while our sandwich was prepped, dressed, and brought to the table on white paper.  By the time our sandwich had arrived another couple groups had entered the restaurant and our server's mood began to soften - a little.  Presented with a smile our Bacon, Egg, and Cheese sandwich was quite good.  Thick yet yielding the white bread provided a great transport medium that stood up well to the sweet and savory slaw, crispy golden fries, salty bacon, creamy egg, and (honestly) somewhat underwhelming cheese.  Divided amongst the three of us the sandwich was enough to get a taste of what the restaurant was all about and enough for me to say the food largely makes  up for the service.  Much like many \"legendary\" restaurants (Tony Packo's, Central Grocery, etc) the food at Primanti's isn't going to blow your mind - but the setting, style, and experience are definitely something to witness when you're visiting from out of town.",

    "text": "We were passing Pittsburgh on our way to Canada and asked a friend from Pittsburgh where we should stop for lunch.  She told us the history of Primanti Brothers and we thought it sounded great.  If this is traditional Pittsburgh food that has been around for close to 100 years than the food scene in Pittsburgh is sad.  The cheeseburger sandwich was a dried out, overcooked brown disc that looked like a frozen Salisbury steak patty without the gravy.  The bread was soft and immediately got soggy from the cole slaw.  The coleslaw was watery and bland; the fries were cold, undercooked, limp, soggy, and had no seasoning or flavor.  My teenage sons will eat absolutely anything and even they thought it was disgusting!  We were starving and short on time so we ate and left after clearing up the confusion over the bill.  They hand you a handwritten ticket with no prices or total on it and she tried to charge us $55 initially.  When my husband questioned the amount she fixed it to the correct $42.  Honest mistake or padding her tip in this 'cash only' establishment?  The area around The Strip where Primanti Bros. is located was dirty and depressing as well.  I can't imagine why anyone would go to Pittsburgh, or why anyone could find that nasty, bland food appealing.  The worst food experience of our lives.  But hey, we have a funny story out if it.",

There is one spot in chicago that does similar sandwiches with fries and cole slaw with the bread between the meat so I had a little experience before this visit.  I got two sandwiches the cheese steak and the corned beef.  both we very bad.  Bread was fresh, fries were hot but that is about it.  every bite all i tasted was fries with an after taste of sweet slaw.  the steak in the cheese steak  tasted like it was made in a microwave.  the meat had to have been bought at a local grocery store because it was as bland as bland gets.     I guess it's my fault for getting the corned beef.  why would a place in the middle of freaking PA have a good corned beef sandwich.  they didn't, took one bite and threw it out.  beef was very dry and the overwhelming taste of the fries and slaw once again dominated the tasteless flavor.   before both sandwiches found the garbage i pulled the meat out to taste separately in case i missed something, i didn't.  complete waste of time, money and what could have been a more flavorful experience at a nearby Jimmy Johns",

After watching the gross antics of 'man eats world', I wanted to inaugurate the weekend by joining others in this pilgrimage.   If you miss the craziness on Penn Ave, don't worry. The line during lunch time will bring you back to the hustle of \"the strip.\" The place has two main sitting areas, one with a bar and one with a counter to witness the birth of a sandwich. Its reminiscent of your childhood when you stuffed potato chips into a sandwich that your mom made but instead with slaw and fries...genius! Who needs plates? Just parchment paper and your hands is all that's required. Good food, fast service, and only cash people. Overall I'd give it a 3 1/2 stars.  What we ordered: - corned beef and cheese - pastrami and cheese  When did we go: - Saturday @ noon  Will we come back? Definitely! My wife wants me to bring some back in a cooler. :D",

    "text": "There's not much I can say here about the food that hasn't already been said. As a vegetarian, you can get a cheese combo sandwich as long as you aren't concerned about cross-contamination with meat.  Rather, I am here to write about the atmospheric experience. I would consider this particular Primanti's to be for the tourists and out of towners who think that bad service is part of getting the Primanti's experience.   I have gone to this location many times and for many years, as it was minutes from where I used to live. I marveled at the rude service time and time again, but gave some excuse to how busy the restaurant was at the time (particularly if it is only open on the bar side). There was one day, however, that aside from myself and my husband there were only two other customers in the shop. My husband asked for his cheese combo to be made only with one type of cheese--as he had done countless times--and the waiter refused, saying it was impossible and touting he had worked there for 15 years and he knew what they could make. He told us that we had never been served that sandwich in that way. He tried to retract and communicate as humans do, but he couldn't pull it off for long. The waiter continued to be gruff and sharp until we were mercifully given our food that was ordered as carry out.   In my opinion, there's no reason for their staff to behave in such a way. It makes for an unpleasant experience and the story I relayed to you above makes me think that their behavior is a result of the lack of service skills since it even appears when the shop isn't busy.  Unless you are coming in for a special visit (as many do because of food related shows), I suggest the Oakland location where the staff is consistently friendly.",

It almost makes the *bright and sunny * Burgh weather not sting that much!  Cheesesteak. Awesome! Hot sausage Awesome! Line.. Not Awesome. But it's usually only bad at late night after the clubs close. This place  is to late night dining in Pittsburgh as Carne Asada chips and burritos are to late nught San Diego dining!  As you can tell from other reviews these sandwiches are unique to say the least, and I am pretty sure they come one way, the way they serve them! But I love them that way.

When I moved here, I got the \"Oh my ghad ya have to go to Pimanny's!\"   After doing a search for Pimanny's, and the GPS asking if I meant Primanti's, I went to PRIMANTI'S. Actually, the boyfriend and I went to Primanti's. The boyfriend doesn't like a lot of stuff on his sandwich. He asked for the fries and slaw on the side. Enter first bad impression. \"You can't have it on the side!' The woman behind the counter snapped. Um, yeah, I can. I look around and notice that everything is served on wax paper, so I poke the boy and point to a patron's \"plate.\" So boyfriend says \"it's ok if you just pile it up next to the sandwich, I don't mind.\" She replies \"It comes on the sandwich. Not on the side.\" So needless to say, no slaw or fries for Mr. Boyfriend. At this point, I'm pissed. If you read my other reviews you know I work in customer service FOR TIPS. I don't care where I am, I don't care how it's served. This is bad service. We didn't ask for anything special or complicated. Whatever. I'm here, and he ordered, so I guess we are still eating.   I ordered the fish. \"You want yours no slaw no fries too I bet, huh?\" Repress. Urge. To. Be. A. Jerk. \"No, as is will be fine, thanks.\"   So it's Italian bread. Ok. The crust is hard, the bread gets soft with all the stuff on the sandwich. Eating these things is a hot mess. I don't mind a messy meal, but I don't get the appeal here. I understand the history, truck drivers needed to eat on the go, everything went on the sandwich, problem solved. Well, I'm not a truck driver. I'm not on the go. I'm sitting at your bar, wondering how the hell anyone ever ate this while they were driving without wearing it. Anyway, it wasn't epic. The fish was plain, the slaw was plain, the fries were fries, and the bread was meh. The lady came and asked my boyfriend \"how's your sandwich?\" He shrugged \"It's all right.\" Whoa, apparently that's grossly offensive language or something. \"It's all right?! It's the best around!'' No, maam. Not by a long shot.   I'll pass. Thanks but no thanks. People say \"well, we grew up here, it's what we eat. It's better when you're drunk.\" Ok, I'll keep that in mind. Next time I'm hammered and want to eat a mediocre sandwich with a side of crappy service, I'll be sure to stop on by.",

Just the grossest pile of low quality meat smothered in soggy fries and disappointing cabbage slaw on a bun soaked in so much grease that it disintegrates while you eat it.  The floors, walls, and ceiling are caked in grease and all of the employees need to shower and shave.  And no matter what time of day you are there, ESPN is on a flatscreen on every wall, further reinforcing the trashy vibe.",

On a recent trip from Phoenix I wanted to check out a place that showcased history of the \"Burgh\" and this was at the top of my list.    The food and quality of the items aren't the reason why you come here.  You also don't come to be impressed by the serivice.  The reason is to enjoy a long time staple of this wonderful city.  Where else have you ever heard of a sandwich with cole slaw and fries on it?  If so, I'm sure Primanti's started the idea.  Walking in you feel like you are walking back in time to when the place was first opened.  The decor is quite inviting for the worker/ or family type.  Not really for anyone fancy, but then again this place isn't anywhere near fancy!    Located in the \"Srip District,\" just a short jaunt from downtown I would tell anyone to pop their head into this place.  To experience history as well as enjoying all of the stores/markets in this area.",

They were horrible. We were there almost 15 minutes before anyone took our order (we should have left by then but it was late and we were hungry).  The food was horrible.  I ordered a bowl of vegetable soup and it was broth with cabbage in it.  Period.  My husband's sandwich took forever to be delivered to him and then it was wrong.  During the time we had our food we kept waiting for someone to check on us and ask about our food and no one....I mean no one ever showed up.  Once the Manager finally showed up and we told him all that was wrong he seemed offended that we complained.  He said he'd adjust our bill and after 10 minutes we found him and said 'what the heck is going on?  Where is our check?'  He got nasty with us again, and said something like 'Fine, it's on me.'  Never apologized for any issues we'd had.  I will never, ever return to a Primanti Brothers ever.  Ever.",

The concept is great - crispy fries with slaw and soft bread and salty meat, what's not to like?   Maybe it's because we didn't eat it right away or b/c we crushed the two sandwiches in one bag, the bread was smushed and sandwich a bit soggy.   I liked the pastrami better than the corned beef. It was a bit big for my mouth so I end up getting a bite of slaw/fries/bread and another bite w/ more meat but no slaw.. I am not sure what can be done to the sandwich to fix the \"small mouth\" issue, but I was sad I couldn't get it all in one bite.   It was ~$6.50 for each sandwich so pretty cheap meal. The ambiance was really cool and seems like lots of college students.   Will probably visit again to see if I like it better when it's eaten immediately.",

Then when our food was brought out someone else brought it out and was very rude asking us to move our things even though she had ample room to place our food.

You should also go to this particular one, as it's the original.  It's super informal.  Here is the breakdown:  Your choice of lunch meat/meat and coleslaw and french fries on fresh bread.  You can add cheese and a lot of other things as well.  If you aren't a huge eater, split it with a friend.  These sandwiches feel like lead in my stomach, and I am happy with just a 1/2.  They do serve beer in many sizes so you can have a beer or two with your sandwich.  There are also wings and pizza, but I've never tried them or seen anyone order them.  The sandwiches are the big draw.  Low point:  There are always a bunch of rude, drunk Yinzers here.  They're loud, and they'll harass you.  I don't like going out to eat and being bothered by others, but some people seem to not mind.  This isn't \"people being friendly.\"  It's people being annoying so just be prepared.  Cash only!",

For some reason, putting french fries on a sandwich was so foreign to me, but boy am I glad I sucked it up and gave it a try.  I had the pastrami sandwich (double meat). You can tell they use high quality meats, because the pastrami was very tender. It paired well with the tang and crunch of the coleslaw.   Their french fries are delicious. I'm not sure what type of oil they use, but the fries have a distinct flavor that add an extra punch to the sandwich.",

The bread was soft and not soggy and the combination of the tomato and coleslaw was yummy :p The chili fries were bomb too! The waiter also recommended the Big Hop IPA from a local brewery which also went well with our meal. The place was also filled with artwork that represented the city of Pittsburgh which was cool to look at it. Great food, Great Service and Good Vibes!

I'll admit, the sandwich size was a bit daunting but I dove in quickly with excitement.  Every bite was fantastic and when I was done, I was surprisingly full.

Other vegetables there. And by eating them separate for the past thirty or so years, I wasted so much time. If we do the math, let's say two of the meals had the food separated, and the additional time needed to eat the separate foods was an additional five minutes per meal. That is 70 minutes a week, 3,640 minutes a year. So over the course of my 31 years of life I have completely wasted approximately 75.83 days taking time to eat foods separately from one another. And then I come to this place. Do you know what this place does? They put the potato and the veggies ON YOUR SANDWICH.   I didn't know you could do that. I called my parents and told them I decided to change my last name because I couldn't be associated with a family of liars.   I eat all food between two slices of bread now.  Salads have become exponential better. Soup not so much.   With my newfound free time I plan on taking up the ancient art of the tea ceremony, maybe even learning Mandarin.   ",

Almost everyone visiting Pittsburgh hears of Primanti's and wonders what's so special and I'm sure they're surprised to hear that it's primarily that sandwiches are served here with fries included inside - an unrealized dream most people didn't know they had.   Personally, I've been twice and as much as I like fries, I find that I enjoy my fries on the side just fine, and so that itself is not a draw for me. They do have a lot of other standard fare and pretty good mozzarella sticks, so still worth checking out, especially if you're downtown or in the Strip District and want to have that traditional authentic Pittsburgh experience.",

I knew I had to capitalize on the opportunity to try this staple.   To no one's surprised, it was busy during what would otherwise be an off hour for restaurants. I sat near the booth and it took a little while to actually place the order. Once I did so, the order came out rather quickly.   I ordered the tuna sandwich without the fries inside (although that's what they're known for) but with other extra fillings. They also sell huge deli pickles, which I wanted as well.  The food itself was okay. It didn't blow me away, but it took care of a hunger need. The bread, which goes on every one of the sandwiches, did not compliment what could have been a better sandwich. Perhaps I could of tried their most popular one , but I feel the overall wait for it wouldn't have put me on cloud nine either. The deli pickle was good though.   In the end, I am glad that I tried out a restaurant I've seen plenty on the television. Next time I'm in Pittsburg, I will be trying another city institution.",

    "text": "When in Pittsburgh, the original Strip District location of Primanti Bros is definitely a foodie destination, because we've all seen it on TV. Not going here would be like going to Philly and not trying either Pat's or Geno's (both crap) or Mike's in Boston (far better cannoli around the corner, without the tourist mob) or Katz's in NYC (I've never actually had it). You've gotta check the box.  Following the lead of Adam Richman and his \"Best Sandwich in America\" TV show, I ordered what he had, a Capicola (spicy Italian ham) & Cheese, with an added runny fried egg (and of course fries, slaw, tomato on top). Then I went back to Philly and had a Di Nic's roast pork in Reading Terminal Market, which was exactly the matchup in the first episode.  It's the only Primanti I've had, but it was definitely tasty, and I would eat it again, but I don't feel any particular urge ever to go again, unless I'm with someone who has never been there. Fries in a sandwich just doesn't appeal to me, not being a truck driver lol.  In case you don't know, Di Nic's Roast Pork in Philly beat everyone else's sandwich on the TV show. Can't say I was surprised, since that's as close to a perfect sandwich as I've evah had.",

The guy was a complete asshole. He was rude, thought he was super important for being a 40 year old working at a restaurant and didn't attempt to meet our needs in anyway.   The food itself was a neat one time type of thing. The #2 seller is a \"burger\" but looked like a black blob. It wasn't real beef. I've had bubba burgers that were better and those are gross. The bread was amazing, but that's about it. I couldn't even eat my sandwich, but you know the server didn't care. I ate half of my friends steak sandwich which was much more edible. Having Coleslaw And fries on a sandwich is cool but it was over powering. My husbands Ruben was salty and didn't have much meat. I would never return here, but it was a cool one time thing to say I did. The server needs to be fired, or maybe it's a Pittsburgh thing to talk to their customers like they are scum.",

I love this location in particular because it's the original, the dive, where everything is made right there amidst the delicious grease and darkness instead of in some sterile chain-restaurant kitchen. Somehow everything comes out better and tastes better here. I got a free double-meat coupon for joining their mailing list, and I put it to good use last time I visited here. I can see why single meat might seem kinda skimpy, because with the fries and slaw right there on the bread, they can overwhelm the main feature, but with double meat you get to taste everything in every bite. I also opted for chili fries as an appetizer this time, and was rewarded with a huge basket of fries (this is a two-person appetizer MIN.) covered with chili that puts anything in Cincinnati to shame. (Texas will still massacre anyone else's chili, but I'm talking about Cinci-style runny chili here, not the meaty thick good stuff, and now I want to go back to Texas just writing this parenthetical statement.)  Tl;dr? Go here. Detour here. Visit Pittsburgh again, get downtown, and get yourself a huge sandwich with no apologies. Throw back a local brew if you like, watch the game if it's on, and eat up!",

    "text": "I have never met a potato I did not like. With that said, when the boyfriend told me about the legendary Pittsburgh sandwiches at Primanti Brothers, I knew I just had to try them. French fries IN the sandwich you say?!?  I'm the gal that rejoiced when Liz Lemon gives the golden advice to put potato chips in your sandwiches. \"Finally,\" I thought. \"Someone gets me!\" With that in mind, the boyfriend and his parents were gracious enough to take me to Pittsburgh's sandwich mecca. Primanti Brother's has been expanding quite a bit in southwestern Pennsylvania, but it is at the original Strip District location that you get that real old timey feel. Our group of 4 were seated immediately around 1:30PM on a Monday.  In a nutshell, this genius sandwich was created many moons ago to help accommodate to truck drivers who needed sustenance in a hurry (or so legend dictates). The result is a giant sandwich consisting of Italian bread, sweet and sour cole slaw, tomatoes, provolone cheese, a handful of fries, and your choice of meat. In all seriousness though, this sandwich isn't as terrifying as it sounds. The bread holds up great, the fries are perfect and hand-cut, and the slaw has just the right balance of sweet and sour that isn't overwhelming on the palate.  I LOVED this sandwich...and I hate cole slaw. I ordered the steak and cheese version of the sandwich as recommended by newlyweds Jess and Brian (we were in town for their wedding), while boyfriend opted for salami and his parentals got the pastrami. After stealing a couple of bites here and there, I've decided that everything was a winner. The steak was tender, the salami was cured well, and the pastrami (while different than what I am used to in LA and NYC), was perfectly lean and thinly sliced. At under $10 a pop, you can't lose.  I am glad that my first Primanti's experience was at the Strip District, which is still quite lively with specialty food vendors and warehouses supplying the city's restaurants. The industrial surroundings are exactly the kind of image someone from out of state imagines Steeler town, and with a view of the smoke-stacks coming out of the Heinz plant just a stone's throw away, it's a point of Pittsburgh pride that can't be beat.",

We were seated by the bar, which was cool but weren't offered the option of a table and there were a few empty ones nearby and couldn't get a staff member to look at us until it was time to order. I ordered a steak and cheese and received a Pitts-burger. I asked the waitress if it was the steak and cheese and she nodded her head and walked off. That was the last interaction we had with any of the staff until we paid at the register. When she rang us up she listed off my sandwich, now calling it a Pitts-burger. Cool, thanks for ignoring us and dismissing my opportunity for you to correct your mistake. Checked the box for the original location, we will go to the spin-offs from now on.",

I ordered the Pitts-burgr for the experience and it was a great big meh.  I'm not sure there was salt anywhere near those fries or burger patty.  I'm not normally one to put more salt on food after it comes out of the kitchen but I found myself salting almost every bite.  If it wasn't salt it was ketchup or hot sauce.  Based on the shape of the patty it seemed to be a frozen patty.  The fries could have used more time in the fryer - some were in the realm of undercooked.  The slaw seemed like it might have been scooped out of a 5 gallon bucket purchased from Sysco or something.  On the bright side the service was great.  The two guys working were both very friendly and eager to please.  And the bread was nice and fresh.",

Although it's located near the warehouses with a lot of trucks running by, it's still a safe place to park your car nearby and grab a bit to eat.  I'm not a big fan of mixing foods all in one, but the sandwiches \"work\" real well.  The cole slaw adds good texture and the vinegar gives it some needed spice.  The french fries add some heat (temperature) and some starchiness.  I ordered the pastrami and cheese so the cheese was melted and the pastrami was good quality.  The bread was soft so I could grab it and stuff a good bite of everything in my mouth.  It's a pretty good value for that time of night and a great way to finish off the night.  Staff was friendly, too.",

While many have said it's huge, and yes it is, at first glance, it's mainly bc there are so many french fries in it, my corned beef was a bit skimpy on the actual meat.  The others I was with enjoyed it, but yeah, grease really wasn't what I was looking for.  I didn't expect to have a warm reception but our server was definitely on the rude side, I know you've probably had a long day, but hello, this is your job, try a little.  Cash only.

    "text": "Primanti's is to Pittsburgh as Pat's King of Steaks is to Philly - an icon, a novelty, a must try, and a quintessentiially hometown institution.  Ah, but how's the food?  My view: good food and great value.  I've been to this location (their flagship and the original) as well as the Steubenville Pike one.  I don't know if it's True for their other locations, but these two are very comparable.  So this review constitutes my take on both.    This is bar food - greasy, flavorful, unpretentious, messy, and great with beer (though not Iron City Light - Yuck!).  The decor is pure Steeltown sports tribute,  heavy on Steelers and Pens, but nary a Pirate (I wonder why. It's not the Bucs' fault that MLB's economics make it impossible for small markets to compete, and the Pirates were GREAT before the Yanks and Sox started ruining baseball by outspending every other team).  Putting the fries and slaw right on the sandwich is fine with me, because the sandwich basically disintegrates after your first savory bite.  I suppose those who complain about the fries on the sandwich probably wanted to drown them in ketchup anyway.  The Italian bread is thick and soft; I've never been here and had it stale (despite some of the other reviewers' comments).  I do miss the knockwurst, but there's still a good array of choices.  Again, I think the prices are good and the food is a high quality bargain.  Well, maybe not the wings at the Steubenville location - I think $4 for 5 wings is a bit too much, but maybe that's the Western New Yorker in me talking.  Oh, and the chili was good (with onions and cheddar added), but not of the 5 alarm variety.  All joking about IC Light aside, their draft selection is solid - lots of variety.  This is a great place to watch a game, strap on the feedbag after a night on the town, or sample an authentic Pittsburgh institution.",

The fries were mushy, even without touching the slaw, only crunch was the uncooked potato in the center of the fry, lunch meats are just super cheap processed crap, and the burger is totally garden variety, top it off with cheap wonder bread type bread (not toasted and not Italian to the reviewer who has clearly never eaten either) and you've got a perfectly mediocre meal worth skipping. At least with subway you expect the disappointment. Oh, and the service was awful, disappointing food is bad enough, waiting a half hour to order it is just a waste.",

I do agree with some reviews the place is filthy and dirty.... being a germaphob I somehow always seem to put the griminess of this location aside and eat here anyways until... as walking out the late week night I came in a pleasant little mouse  popped from underneath of one of the coolers or cooking station / prep area stations.   Needless to say, I haven't been back since because seeing a LIVE mouse , kind of put a nail in the  coffin for me . One of the cities fine Health inspectors needs to take a stroll in here and diligently inspect and evaluate the conditions of this location ( I don't care how old or how great of a Pittsburgh landmark and staple this is ) mice carry harmful diseases that can be passed to humans. In addition to the Health Inspectors and Health Department getting involved this location needs thoroughly scrubbed down , cleaned, and their employees need to wash after they hop back inside from smoking out on the corner and wash their hands after they touch cash and then touch all the food on the line. Sorry Primanti's , but you need to get your cleaning act and rodent problem under control at this location.   Ciao fellow Yelpers.",

    "text": "One of the best places to eat in Pittsburgh, but it really does depend on what you get. I suggest the Bologna, Capicola, or Pastrami with cheese and I don't even like Bologna! These sandwiches are excellent! My twin sister loves to get a fried egg on her's, which is also very tasty.   My favorite thing here is the coleslaw! It's very simple, not made with MAYO, which I love! The fries are on the sandwich, typical Pittsburgh, so good!  In a classic dive, working man's place like this, who cares about service? It's served to you on a piece of parchment paper, not even a plate. If you need a drink refilled, go to the counter and ask. It's really not that big of a deal. If you are looking to be pampered and treated special GO SOMEPLACE ELSE TO EAT!",

    "text": "You know what? I'm gonna go ahead and give this place a five star rating. Yeah its touristy and kinda cliche, so what? Let me elaborate on why I think this place deserves five stars before people start thinking I hand out five star reviews like candy on Halloween.   Came here for dinner while recently visiting Pittsburgh for the very first time. Got here around 5 PM and the place was pretty busy and crowded. Even though it was busy I was greeted immediately by a friendly lady behind the counter who informed me they would clear a table off ASAP for us. Waited a couple minutes and a lot more people came in behind us. They were promptly greeted as well. When some random guy came in and tried to completely bypass the line he was immediately sent to the back of the line by the workers. Friendly and efficient yet not afraid to put trolls in their place. I like it.   After a few minutes we were seated and our drink orders taken. When the waiter returned he took our sandwich order. I went with the pastrami and cheese sandwich. If you don't already know the standard sandwich at Primanti Brothers comes with your choice of meat, cheese, coleslaw, and fries all stuffed in the sandwich. Sandwiches were pretty good sized and having your fries and coleslaw put into the sandwich is awesome! The bread used was super fresh, the pastrami was top notch, coleslaw is super fresh, and the fries are clearly fresh cut. The sandwich is so unique and good that its a real winner. Prices are great too. Pretty much all the sandwiches run from 6 to 8 bucks. Food came out pretty fast and our waiter was a cool guy that had no problem chatting us up and giving us recommendations for great local hangouts amongst the hustle and bustle of dinnertime at this iconic spot.  Atmosphere is great here too. The place has that old deli feel with a lunch counter you can sit at as well as tables. The walls are adorned with all kinds of old signs and sports decor. Their menu is painted large and bright on the wall which makes ordering easy. Also, i want to make note that there are tons of Primanti Brothers locations in and around Pittsburgh but this one is the original. This is THE Primanti Brothers.   Great food, great atmosphere, solid service, reasonable prices, and cool people working here. There is absolutely no reason to dock any stars off this place. So, here ya go Primantis five stars for you. Can't wait to get back here for another sandwich.",

    "text": "I only had one meal in Pittsburgh, and I was told by many friends (and confirmed by the Internet as I don't trust my friends) that I should eat here.  And eat here I did.  I read about the history of this joint, and you can't help but respect it.  Started from humble beginnings, and the interesting sandwich combo was developed from the start (as opposed to being a recent gimmick).  It's humble and simple.  Got the Pittsburgher (their acclaimed #2 seller, which I realized was somewhat of a joke as their #1 seller is Iron City beer).  Also doubled down and got cheese fries.  I think I gained 4 lbs just from looking at my food, and another couple after downing just half of it.  The burger had a pretty lame patty sandwiched in their typical fashion --- italian bread, cole slaw, French fries, tomato, and provolone.  But it just didn't work.  Too much starch, not enough saltiness, and hard to distinguish flavors between each other.  The cheese fries were OK, but nothing special.  At the end of the day I'm glad I ate here.  It's a \"cultural\" experience and one has to respect this establishment's history and how the locals pride themselves in the sandwich.  It's not my cup of tea, but if you're going to Pittsburgh and want to eat a piece of history (does that even make sense???), you should come here.",

The sandwich came wrapped in butcher paper.  It was visually appealing    The bread was very fresh Italian bread the Salisbury steak paddy cooked and seasoned well. All sandwiches come with French fries and cole slaw right on the sandwich. This is the tradition and charm of the place and it did not disappoint.   I will return someday.

Well it definitely lived up to the hype.   All the sandwiches are made the same way: coleslaw, tomato and fries added on top of your choice of meat.  The bread is a thick cut but soft white Italian bread.  I opted for the Cajun chicken.   This was a solid sandwich. What I loved about the coleslaw is that it was oil and vinegar based. The flavor blended nicely with the fries and spicy chicken.  Needless to say, three were no leftovers.   Will definitely be back when traveling through the Pittsburgh area.",

He ordered the \"cheese steak\" which surprisingly was more like a steak/burger patty while I ordered the corned beef. The quality of the meat in my sandwich was fine, but the \"unique\" attributes and what should be the stars of the sandwich - the fries and slaw - were severely underwhelming. The fries were undercooked, mushy and desperately needed seasoning yet salt and pepper shakers were nowhere to be found. The slaw was bland, so bland we both agreed that if it wasn't on the sandwich we wouldn't have even noticed. My friend complained that his cheese steak was dry (the small piece of cheese was hard to detect) and he had to keep using hot sauce just to get it down. Not exactly a good sign. It may have been better had he paid 50 cents for extra cheese. Oh yeah - the sandwich maker behind the counter was friendly, but made up both sandwiches without gloves and I never saw him wash his hands. I'm not normally a germophobe but I thought that was odd.  All in all we both agreed that the sandwiches were \"decent\" but it definitely is not worth driving out of the way for. I guess this is another one of those local legends that out of towners just don't get.",

It will be unusual for non-locals, but grab a seat at the counter and watch them pile on handfuls of coleslaw and fries onto each sandwich. I had a capicola/cheese sandwich that was out of this world. I had to try the chili fries too, and it can feed a 2 people easily.... above-average.  One warning: finding street parking will be difficult.",

I had the number 1 and the number 2 seller (as indicated by the menu) and, believe me, neither were disappointing. I'll start by describing the number 2 selling item and meanwhile I'll let you guess what the number 1 seller is (it's pretty obvious and I'm surprised I had to ask).  Anyway, the number 2 selling item is their cheese steak sandwich...but this is no ordinary cheese steak. It is PILED HIGH with meat, cheese, french fries (on the sandwich), a large slice of tomato, and coleslaw. Sound strange? ITS NOT...it is delicious and please keep in mind that I don't typically allow myself to eat  things that are as big as my face BUT this is absolutely WORTH IT!!!    TIP: I should have read the fine print and ordered my sandwich with onions (available by request).  So...have you guessed what their number one selling item is? BEER...Iron City Beer to be exact. Good stuff and it compliments the massive sandwich very well.  Get it.",

Moved to the bar to order, waited for the jackass behind the bar to get back to his job when a commercial came on (sorry to pull you away from the chiefs game). The sandwich was mediocre at best, just a gimmick of putting soggy fries on a run of the mill deli sandwich.

    "text": "I went here about three years ago and had the \"original\" which is some sort of cheese steak, mystery meat sandwich. It was awful--I have no idea what the meat actually was. I swore I would never come back to this place, but I decided to give it another try. This location was way nicer inside than the one on Carson street, which I thought was weird since this is the original, and what I thought was the oldest Primanti Bros.  The service is typical Pittsburgh service. A slight chip on the shoulder, somehow laid back and uptight at the same time. We got there around 11:30 am, which was right before the Sunday rush started.  This time I tried the Corned beef with cheese. One of these days I'm going to try the sardine sandwich, but after a night of binge drinking on Carson... The corned beef was to die for. The best corned beef I have ever had, actually. As with the last time, the bread is also really delicious. It's soft, flavorful and yeasty. What throws me is the coleslaw/ fries on the sandwich. I know that's what actually makes it Primanti's, but I'm not a huge coleslaw fan to begin with, and I really don't think their fries are that good. The fries are too soft and have almost a sweet, off putting flavor. I understand the thought process/ history behind putting everything ON the sandwich, but it really is not my ideal way to eat.  Stay away from the cheese steak, stick with the other meat choices!",

We ordered three sandwiches, beef and cheese, corned beef and cheese, and ham and cheese. All three came with tomatoes, cole slaw, and french fries, on the sandwich. The bread was very fresh and cut at a good thickness. The fries were a little undercooked, the corned beef wasn't the best quality, the cheese was okay, the coleslaw was very heavily black peppered and a little under dressed. BUT, when you put it all together it was pretty successful.",

My sister-in-law and her husband were trying to talk me out of eating here... \"nasty sandwich\" is the phrase she used to describe it and I shrugged my shoulders.  Last Monday, she took us to breakfast @ Pamela's but I made a big deal about how I wasn't going to spoil my appetite and would hold out for one of your sandwiches - my sister-in-law was all like \"you won't like it\" but I pretended I couldn't hear her - she insisted on waiting in the car with the kids... whatever.  I ordered the hot sausage sandwich and it was a heart-stopper.  The lady at the grill was super nice and asked me where I was from and explained the Primanti to me... \"all ingredients are fresh, etc etc\" - at one point, what I believe was their tomato vendor came in to order a sandwich and she sent him back to get some more tomatoes... she spoke freely in the expletive vernacular - it was honestly refreshing.  Oh yeah - my sister-in-law, she's from St. Louis and is a college professor (in theology), so I hope that explains where she's coming from and why I cannot take her food critique seriously.  Some people eat sandwiches holding their pinkies out (she and her husband are that kind of sandwich eaters) but looking to my left and right @ the lunch counter, I don't think I saw any pinkies sticking out... just saying.  Your sandwiches are delicious and I look forward to having another one if/when I'm back in the area.",

So not worth the 45-minute wait and the absolutely crappy service.    Their signs indicated you could get a grilled or cajun chicken sandwich.  I chose grillled but when my husband ordered, the cashier said they hadn't served that in years and only the cajun was available.  Um, okay...so take the darn False-advertising sign down.   There was a long line from the time we arrived to the time we left and only four people working; all four were taking orders AND doing the cooking.  the cashier would take a few orders and then ignore the other customers in line for no less than 10 minutes while she helped with the grill.  Ridiculous.  There were some people who eventually left...I don't blame them.    My order was brought out about 20 minutes before my husband's so of course, I ate since I was starving.  Nothing to brag home about; I threw half of the sandwich away. We had to wait at least another 10 minutes, back in line, for a drink refill.  There was a group who ordered before us who was just getting their food when we left.  He had to go to the other side of the restaurant to a refill on his beer.  I was just really confused about the whole place...it wasn't a sit-down restaurant because there were no official servers, but it most definitely was not \"fast\" food.  .    It may be a Pittsburgh instituttion, but I would've rather gone to McDonald's for as long as we waited.  Never plan to go back.",

They were expecting the traditional sliced steak, instead it was a patty, reminded me of a Steak Um. We got the loaded fries, the cheese was kind of like cheese whiz, the bacon tasted like bacon bits not fresh bacon.  They accept Cash Only. Stick to the deli meats, pastrami, turkey, corned beef. I'd stay away from the Steak and Cheese and Fries. My sandwich was great, sorry my daughters didn't have the same experience. If you are a tourist it is definely a great spot to check out and get the experience. I found the staff very friendly. Enjoyed our stay in Pittsburgh and all the nice people.",

    "text": "I knew how popular Primanti Bros. sandwiches were for locals, tourists, and anyone who comes to the Pittsburgh area.  I was going to just try it once at the original Strip District location and not try it ever again.    Of course, what happens?  I end up eating a sandwich every day that I stayed in the city, including buying a sandwich for the road before heading out.    What makes these sandwiches so great and craveable?  No not cocaine laced in the meats but it just simply works.  The fries, slaw, meat, and bread just works together well.  And one sandwich is all you need to get full.  I wouldn't recommend eating two because that will lead to regrettable overeating stomach pains.  I did enjoy the old school vibe of the original location as I saw a bunch of old regulars sitting at their stools when I came in.  Also very old school style: they yelled out to the dining room to tell that a car in the parking lot had left their headlights on.  Priceless and not something you see every day when you sit in your average restaurant.  I've had the Capone with capicola, salami, and Italian sausage, the Jumbo Bologna, and the corned beef.  All were equally delicious and satisfying.  I'm so lucky that Primanti's is not on the West Coast because I'd become a fatty in absolutely no time.  So yes I'll miss your delicious sandwiches but at the same time, I won't miss your starchy calories as much as I enjoy eating them.  I definitely recommend going to the Strip District location as it is worth seeing the place where it all started.  The environment and atmosphere of the original really can't be duplicated anywhere else.",

I dug the chicken wings, the snickers pie was good, but the sandwich was a little on the bland side. I got the Pitts-burger at the suggestion of the waitress.

I finally made my way to Pittsburgh and the Strip District to try it first-hand.  We saddled up to the bar right behind where the food is made.  Had the Pastrami w/ fried egg and...it tastes exactly like I thought it would (which is a good thing).  I was surprised at how high-quality the pastrami was.  This is probably not somewhere I would eat regularly, but I appreciated the experience.  One note:  I was AMAZED to watch the sandwiches being made.  I was there during the lunch rush and all of the sandwiches are made by only one person.  She cuts the bread (once every 5-6 sandwiches or so), works the griddle filled with meat and eggs, makes all of the fries, etc.  It is impressive.  She deserves every dollar she makes!",

It wasn't busy on a Monday night at 7, mainly because the city totally shuts down after 5 so we got great service from the gal at the bar.   Despite the fact that we knew what we were getting into, everyone besides my hubby and I decided not to share. Bad move, buddy. These sandwiches are ridiculous. Our capicola & cheese came loaded with fries, coleslaw, and tomatoes. It was sort of an adventure figuring out how to eat that bad boy, but super good! I tried a piece of the hot sausage and it was just as tasty as ours.  If you're only in town for a short while (which I hope for your sake you are) Primanti Bros. is a must taste while in town!",

The sandwiches are perfect every time - fresh bread, crunchy slaw, melted cheese, hot fries, and quality meats. We have never had to wait for a seat at this location or had a negative experience here and everything is made fresh right in front of us. Favorites are the capicola and egg, cheese steak and egg, colossal fish, corned beef and egg, and fried pickles.

It may have been a great place when you were rolling through town with a load of pig iron and had 15 minutes to fill your gullet but it currently has no redeemable value other than the kitschy idea of putting everything on your sandwich.    Bread - big,thick fluffy pieces that consumes the sandwich, Meat - under proportioned for the size and quantity of bread.  Slaw - yes.  There's also slaw in sandwich. Fries - precooked.  Soggy.  So many other things in Pittsburgh to try. Heck, potato filled pasta pockets (pierogis) have more character.  So no more. Food network hype.",

The cole slaw here appears to have no mayo and despite my hatred for cole slaw, i actually enjoyed it.  The fries were slightly a little soggy but were very delicious.

    "text": "This is the second time I've had Primanti's. The first being about 10 years ago so I had to try again to reacquaint myself with Pittsburgh's culinary claim to fame.  For an added experience, I had to go to the original location.  For the place being as old as it says, you don't get the entire feel of it, but that's ok.  It's an intimate spot to get a sandwich with the closest of your fellow strangers and tourists.    I first ordered the Smallman Street Fries.  Named after the street of the original location, they've got chili, cheese, jalapenos, and sour cream on it.  I should've just stopped eating here because my meal peaked already.  For the sandwich, I went with the Pitts-burger, their #2 best seller.  I asked what that meant and was told it was a joke.  I guess I didn't get the joke or it just wasn't obvious and funny. Probably the latter.  I wish I remembered what the sandwich was like because this was awful.  While trying to eat it, I was trying to figure out how and why this got to be so popular in this area.  The meat was more like a mystery meat that tasted gross.  Who knows what animal this came from.  As for the cole slaw, it had no flavor to it and seemed to be missing something.  I'd say the bread is the saving grace, but not for this sandwich.  It's a very good thick piece Italian, but for a sandwich like this it needs to be a bit harder with all of the ingredients in it.    Lastly, I feel the need to comment on the service.  I rarely do unless it's extremely good or bad.  Unfortunately, it was not good.  Three different staff members served us.  After the food was brought out to the table, the server said someone will be right over to refill the drinks.  Ok fine.  After a few minutes, no one came over.  I started wondering why she herself didn't refill the drinks.  I had to eat the entire meal without anything to drink.  Not refilling drinks might be my biggest pet peeve dining out.  Thanks for being consistent Primanti's!  Terrible service to go with terrible food.",

If its one thing I will always list as something I will never be a fan of its SLAW (gag) but this packed a surprise I was delighted to receive, the slaw has vinegar kick, there was no mayo in this and for that I say THANK YOU! Seeing how whe you first trying the sandwich you don't want to be rude and ask them to remove toppings lol.  Usually any kind of white bread is not my thing but it fits this, plus more of an italian bread that was very soft which makes unhinging your jaw to down this massive sandwich that much easier since your not biting into a bread-brick!  The fries were amazing like fresh cut that day or something  I give it 4 stars for simple fact its so unique in flavor...can't wait go back to try some different ones",

    "text": "We had to go here due to the reputation and many recommendations from yinz.    Food was good and reasonably priced but flavor was interesting.  The sandwiches are all served with slaw and French fries on them.  Sounds like a great idea but I felt the fries really dampened the taste of the other sandwich ingredients.  We got the pastrami and cheese as well as the corned beef and cheese and the would have been more flavorful without the fries.  But then again, one of the main attractions of this place is fried on the sandwich - so it's all what you prefer,    The atmosphere is good, food comes out super fast and even if you have to wait for a table the turn over is fast.    Worth a stop if you are touring Pittsburgh for the day!",

Spent two days in Pittsburgh and I told my hubby, \"I don't care what we do but we HAVE to go to Primanti Brothers before we go home!\"  Primanti Brothers is what i've associated with Pittsburgh and now that I've been there, for the life of me, I don't understand why.        First of all, no credit cards??  Your sales might sore if you accepted cards but then again, your food would have to match up to offering that feature.         We ordered Cheese steak.  Very little cheese.  It's a CHEESE steak.  Very little meat.  I couldn't even finish my half and not because it was too  big.  Hubby agrees with the comments on the food being bland.  I felt like I ordered a french fry sammy and everything else on the sandwhich were just condiments for the fries.    Probably the worst chili cheese fries I've ever had.    Ok, so I had my Pittsburgh experience and I walked out of the place thinking I'm was just being a food snob because nothing because Cincinnati food.   But now that I've read the reviews, i know its not just me.",

The sandwiches are filling, but when I have to slather on mayo, ketchup, mustard and whatever else to make a sandwich flavorful...why did I just order it? Beer is good and cheap there.  Ambiance is ok.  But if I want a really, really good sandwich, I'll go elsewhere.

Over 80 years ago, a couple of brothers own a sandwich cart (circa great depression), which leads to the opening of a brick and mortar diner in the strip district, and eventually expansion to +15 locations. Seems like a great recipe for success.  That being said, this is a place you come to see a little bit of Pittsburgh history and nostalgia, not for fantastic food. Prices are good and I enjoyed seeing the 'strip district' but other than that, I would take a pass on making a visit to Primanti Brothers.",

The quality and quantity of food you receive is well matched to the price.  I personally can't finish an entire sandwich in one sitting and usually that is a good thing because all though I love it, me and greasy food tend not to  get along...  So Primanti just missed that 5 stars for the sometime sporadic service.  I have had really nice waitresses/waiters and not so nice ones.  I sat at the counter for lunch and I don't think the lady that took my order smiled once at me.  You know that look of complete yinzer annoyance?

Add locations based on a really good idea and a fabulous reputation.   2. Water down that reputation with inconsistent quality across stores and cutting costs to enhance profitability.  3. Remove the heart and soul of the dining experience. In this case by spreading something that was uniquely Pittsburgh across Pennsylvania and into 6 other states.  Once as much a Pittsburgh icon as our sports teams and bridges, visiting Primanti's is now more of a 'said I did it' than the unique eating experience it once was. Might as well go to Applebees.",

When it comes to the beer selection and the price, you're paying below restaurant average and above dive average which earns P. Bros a star in my book. Good, you notice you can't charge 'Friday's' prices for a Yeungling.   The sandwiches are where it is at. All the 2 and 1 star sandwich connoisseurs clearly don't know the background behind the sandwich and just don't understand. It's a trucker sandwich. It was made to have the sides you want ON the sandwich so that it wasn't a hassle on the go.  The slaw is vinegary and not creamy because we are in Pittsburgh after all and a vinegary slaw is krauts cousin and kraut is a common factor in Polish, German, Czech and Slovakian cultures(all big communities in Pittsburgh). The 'coleslaw' at P Bros is easily my favorite part.  Furthermore, with plenty of meat options every sandwich experience is usually different although the Pastrami and the Corned Beef are go to for me. They aren't overly flavorful as you often find yourself adding ketchup and/or Hot Sauce, but over-all still a filling and delicious sandwich.   I wish they would do-away with the restaurant style P bros and stick to small sandwich joints because that would earn it another star. These places are meant to be basic Pub and Grub not sit down restaurants. All that being said, it's still a must have if you are hungover or drunk, simply good grub.",

    "text": "My first stop in the Strip District was the famous Primanti Bros., a chain of sandwich shops founded in 1933 in Pittsburgh. This is the original location. Its signature items are its sandwiches, which consist of grilled meat, an Italian dressing-based coleslaw, tomato slices, and French fries between two pieces of Italian bread.  I settled on pastrami, which was the original sandwich and a sweet tea. I'm not sure if you can tell but this sandwich is stacked! It's hard to get your hands around. The first bite is a bit of shock. Taking in all the tastes, including the slaw. It's different, but delicious, a winning combination for sure! The added fries give it more 'meat'.  I would eat here from time to time. It seems like a good hangover cure.  As I was leaving I ran into Toni. She saw me taking pictures and asked the couple I was sitting next to about me while I was in the restroom. She was waiting for me when I walked out, excited to hear about this girl from Nebraska. What a sweet little lady! Toni has been the manager at Primanti's for 40 years. She migrated here from Italy, which is pretty clear from her thick accent. She started working in a restaurant and became friends with the guy who now owns Primanti's. She said her favorite sandwich is also the pastrami and as far as the 'fame', she doesn't care. \"It's all about making the money.\" She also told me that out of all the famous foodies who have visited, that Bobby Flay is her favorite. \"He's my boyfriend!\"  The original shop is located in Pittsburgh's Strip District, a narrow strip of land where the warehouses and produce yards are located. In the 1930s, the Strip was a very busy place. Truckers delivered their goods in the middle of the night and had to get back on the road quickly. So Primanti's designed their sandwich to be eaten with one hand, while the driver drove the truck with the other. By combining the sides with the sandwich, a Pittsburgh staple was born. Of course, the restaurant offers a slightly humorous take on it, offering the explanation that the Primanti brothers simply forgot the plates and forks one day. According to the restaurant, Joe Primanti, born in suburban Wilmerding, Pennsylvania, invented the sandwich during the Great Depression. His brothers, Dick and Stanley, later joined him. The Primantis opened their hole-in-the-wall restaurant at Smallman Street and 18th Street in the Strip District and served the late-night and early-morning workers who were unloading fish, fruits, and vegetables.  The restaurant was featured in an article in the August 2003 edition of National Geographic magazine.  The restaurant was mentioned on the April 21, 2008, episode of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart in an interview with president Barack Obama. Stewart suggested that Obama visit the restaurant for their \"great sandwiches\", which Stewart had enjoyed as a comedian on the club circuit.   Primanti Brothers made the list of 1,000 Places to See Before You Die in the USA and Canada by Patricia Schultz. The original Primanti Brothers location was also one of the featured stops of Man v. Food host Adam Richman during the show's visit to Pittsburgh.  In 2012, another Adam Richman-hosted show, Best Sandwich in America, featured Primanti's during the Northeast-region episode.",

There is usually a wait to get seated, as everyone wants to eat this sandwich. If you don't know it is served on special bread piled high with hand-cut fries, cole slaw, cheese and meat of your liking. They have tons of memorabilia and have been around forever. In addition, they're open late. There are many locations, but the original one is by far the best.",

    "text": "I don't think that this place is my cup of tea, but based on the line out the door and down the sidewalk; there are certainly a lot of people with the opposite opinion.  Primanti Brothers is obviously an institution in Pittsburg, and I had heard of it many times before I ever got the chance to visit. This location in the Strip District puts it right in the middle of an area with tons of shops and places to visit either before or after your meal, and has a lot of options for paid parking. I thought we had done well in avoiding the lunch crowd by arriving around 1:30 on a Friday, but like I said, the line out the door proved that wrong. The line went pretty quickly, as it is a fast meal for a sit down place. Before you go stand in that line, know that this is a cash only place so be prepared ahead of time.  The menu is pretty simple. Basically just pick your meat from a very long list of options, and they will put that on white bread and pile it with some cheese, french fries, coleslaw, and tomatoes. Onions are an optional extra, and you can get an extra order of fries on the side if the ones on your sandwich aren't enough. The loaded fries actually look pretty delicious, and since this is a 24 hour place I can imagine that those become pretty popular later in the evening. We got our drink and food orders in quickly with the waitress shortly after we got seated. The staff was more of a no-bullshit, get you in and out with everything you need quickly, type of staff. They reminded me of what you'd find in a New Jersey diner, in that they aren't going for over the top friendly service, but you'll get everything you order and you'll get it quickly.   The sandwiches all came out on pieces of wax paper shortly after we put our order in. There are no plates, and they just set them down in front of you on the table, but the overly sized paper squares that they are served on is helpful to keep the fillings that fall out of the sandwich contained and not all over the place. The sandwiches are massive, and will easily leave you full. At under $7 a piece, it's a lot of food for the price. Unfortunately, the sandwich to me just tasted like I was eating a french fry and coleslaw sandwich. It's too big to get a bite of everything, and the smaller portion of meat is easily masked by the giant stack of fries and big scoop of coleslaw even if you could get a representative sample of everything. The white bread is nice and thick and does a good job of keeping the sandwich contents contained. I got pastrami, which is usually a pretty flavorful meat, but it was definitely playing well behind the fries and coleslaw when it came to flavors, due entirely to portion sizes. They have the options to pay extra to get double meat, and I think that I will definitely do that if I find myself here again. I ended up putting hot sauce or ketchup on the last bites of my sandwich to mix up the flavors since it was just too much of the same thing.  All in all, they provide what they try to provide. It's a good sized sandwich at a reasonable price. The place definitely has a nostalgic feeling to it, and doesn't appear to have changed much in a while. It's a great fit for the strip district. They have a unique offering that helps set themselves apart from the rest of the crowd, but I personally think that that is their biggest downfall. The sandwich itself just isn't that good based on the amount of each thing they put on it.   Additionally, if you're looking for something to wash down the food with, they have a full bar inside the restaurant.",

Lots of history and culture?  Check.  But at the end of the day, it's basically a french fry sandwich.  You get some coleslaw, and no more than a garnish of meat if you order something sliced (and not a generous portion if you order anything else).  90% of your meal is pretty decent french fries on above average white bread.  Look, I'm glad Pittsburgh has some culinary identity, and having a classic food item you can only get here is awesome.  But compared to a Philly cheesesteak?  A Chicago pizza?  A New Orleans muffaletta?  Pittsburgh has a long, long, LONG way to go.",

I tried it despite reading all the reviews telling me how mediocre it is. I needed to try it for myself. And I'm glad I did. Now I know I need to never come back here again.   This place is just one big NO. I have no idea how it has become so popular. I really do not get it. I got the pastrami and cheese. This was the sandwich: a slice of regular white bread, three slices of tomatoes, two tablespoons of bland cole slaw, 2 pounds of french fries, one tiny little slice of cheese, about 3-4 slices of pastrami, and another slice of regular white bread. As you can tell from my description, there was not enough meat, non-existent cheese, and way too many fries. The only thing on my sandwich with any flavor was the pastrami (that was actually pretty good and what earned this place a 2-star rating instead of a 1-star). But there just wasn't enough pastrami and the signature fries and cole slaw were not very good.   My sister ordered the cheesesteak, which is really just a cheeseburger. We also ordered the Smallman St. Fries, which are fries with cheese, bacon, chili, and sour cream. They sound delicious right? They looked delicious too. I was super excited to eat them. Sadly, like my sandwich, they did not live up to the hype. I think it was the chili, but I did not enjoy them.   This place was crazy crowded and it's clearly a Pittsburgh staple so maybe it's just me. It's sad really because the sandwiched have so much potential to be amazing!",

You gotta be one unhappy individual to not want any sandwich of your choosing on fresh cut Mancini's Italian Bread topped with fresh cut french fries and cole slaw (tomatoes are your choice).  They have arguably one of the best fish sandwich's you can get any day and time of the week.  They are 24/7 and if you eat the same sandwich 10 times the consistency is that it will be the same, ALL-10-TIMES.  I like the fish but I also like their Pastrami and Corned Beef.

Personally, my favorite sandwich is the Corned Beef and Cheese, especially with the Egg added on top.  I only give this restaurant 3 stars for several reasons - the wait time, the seating confusion, and the customer service. Sometimes, particularly during the summer, the wait for a table can be an hour or longer. Another frustration is the seating. There is very poor seating direction, which I feel can slow down the already long line. Finally, the customer service is lacking. I get that it's not fancy, but I've had a couple waitresses at this location who were pretty brusque. When asking for a soda refill, the reaction of the waitress is as if I requested a free meal.",

Only reason it's 4 stars is because he never dropped the check and then at the resister we were ignored for a few minutes and then he had to ask us what we got.

    "text": "On a Saturday around 11:30 a.m., I was nervous as we arrived in the Strip District.  There were people on the streets everywhere, there were cars everywhere, and there were parking spots...nowhere!  I was shocked when we walked into Primanti Bros and were seated immediately.  Of course, half an hour later, there was a line going out the door.  I had the Roast Beef & Cheese sandwich.  I wanted to try a cheesesteak, but to my surprise, I didn't see one on the menu.  The waitress insisted it was the \"Pitts-burger,\" but...burger?  The service was OK but impatient when it came to taking orders and overall just inattentive.  My roast beef sandwich was just okay.  I liked the thick bread and the fries embedded into the sandwich.  I don't like cole slaw, so I had my sandwich without.  The fries weren't anything great either.  I know Primanti Bros is famous, but I'd like to know how it became that way.  It reminds me of Gene & Jude's in Chicago - lines out the door, simple food, food that is just okay, but perhaps it's nostalgia that people are chasing after?  I like the simplicity of the menu and ingredients.  I like the giant pickles sliced into four spears.  I also liked the mural on the wall of famous Pittsburgh-ians.  But was it worth paying $5-6 in a public lot?  Not really.    My opinion about the service changed about an hour after we left.  I looked down at my hand and noticed my ring (just costume jewelry) was missing.  I called Primanti first, to see if anyone turned anything in, and the man on the phone (OK, he was a little abrupt) told me to come in and look.  We went back in and I rushed to the bathroom (I had taken it off while washing my hands), but my ring wasn't on the sink where I left it.  It had slight sentimental value, so I interrupted the lady behind the bar to ask if anyone had turned anything in.  I described what it looked like, and within seconds she handed me my ring.  I don't know if a customer turned it in, or if an employee found it, but I was so grateful that they stuck it behind the bar thinking someone just MIGHT come back for it.",

If you are not a stickler for doing \"the thing\" then I think you could get an all in one (fries and slaw on the sandwich) in any of the other 2-dozen options: streak, pastrami, turkey, chicken, etc.   But, I like to do the thing, even if it's not my personal choice for a sandwich. So, I sank my teeth into a giant mess inside Italian sourdough bread. It was interesting, tasty but once is enough. (  I actually went before with a friend after passing through town and going to a Pirates game in the early 90's but I can not remember what I got, only that it had fries in it. I would expect that I skipped the slaw, as I hate coleslaw.   This time I went full Monte and was pleased that it was good. The burger is a bit weird, more like a strange lunch meat than a burger. There was just too much slaw and fries and I had to thin it down to actually eat it.   What stands out is how great the staff was--explained everything, filled drinks and brought everything very quickly. They even let my son taste the chili so we did not have to order it and just take a chance.   So, this is your charge if you dare to have the real-deal Pittsburgh experience. Are you man enough?",

    "text": "Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh. So much hype. So disappointing.   I mean, it wasn't bad - but there are so many other sandwich places in Pittsburgh that I feel would have been way more amazing than here. I mean, I guess we can check it off our list, at least. I got the fish sandwich and man-friend got the #2, which ended up being way more like an actual hamburger, and way less like a cheese-steak sandwich. The coleslaw wasn't as delicious as I had hoped it would be, and the fries got all soggy sitting in the soupy-ness of the coleslaw. And the bread was just, white bread. NBD.   Everyone who live(s)(d) here told us no. They tried to warn us. We didn't listen, but wished we would have. Now, we are trying to warn you, and you probably won't listen either. But maybe you will disagree and give it 5 stars! Who knows, that's the beauty of yelp and food reviews!",

My sister has a dairy allergy and specifically asked if the chili had dairy, the waiter said \"Oh no, no!\" She ordered it, ate it painfully (since it was so spicy) and... it had dairy in it.   I don't like bread. At all. Basically, if you don't like or cannot have bread..... well, looks like you're going to starve. The alternatives are the painfully spicy chili or fries covered in disgusting artificial cheese.   My other sister ordered a turkey and cheese sandwich. Well, there was 3 times sloppy coleslaw than that the amount of turkey and cheese. She was grossed out by it.   So, in short, my whole family was disgusted by this restaurant. NOT worth it.",

    "text": "Wasn't sure at first about the whole cole slaw and fries bit but once I tried it I wanted another one. I had the capp and egg last time and It was excellent. The cole slaw is not the typical type, it has a bit more zip from the vinegar which paired well with the cappicola. I enjoy the sandwiches so much that it is a \"must have\" every time I stop in Pitts. Other sandwiches to make note of is the pitts-burgher cheese steak, and the pastrami. The Iron City beer is not too heavy and is perfectly balanced. Word from the wise, if your looking to get in and out, game days are not the days you want to go. There is usually a line out the door. It's not too bad because the line does go relatively quickly but go on a Sunday afternoon if you want a real quick bite. Always two thumbs up!!",

    "text": "Went here with some friends while in the area. Heard it was a famous place in Pittsburgh so we walked down the street from the Altar Bar to check it out. Can't say the service was friendly, but come on! That's what I expected from a couple dudes making sandwiches, grilling, and getting orders shouted at them.  This felt like a True blue collar joint where you go just to enjoy some good American food. I can't say I didn't love the decor: some tables thrown in with some cheap chairs and paintings/characitures of  famous Pittsburgh athletes. It just added to its grittiness. I was only half surprised that the place wasn't painted black, white, and gold. I ordered the \"Soon to be Famous\" Colossal Fish sandwich and it did not disappoint. There is something to love about food that is simple, fried, messy, and to the point. I piled on the ketchup and cayenne pepper sauce. My favorite part had to be the marinated coleslaw. I am not a fan of the traditional mayonnaise-slaw you normally get, so this opened my eyes to what True coleslaw should taste like. My only complaint is that I wish the cayenne pepper sauce had some heat to it as it was really watery and I always feel food like this needs a little kick to it. But next time I'm in Pittsburgh, I'll be stopping at Primanti Brothers for another Colossal Fish.",

As for the food: the pastrami was middling, same with the corned beef. The vinegary cole slaw helped add some flavor, but I still doused mine with hot sauce. It's definitely UNIQUE but I doubt I'll ever go again. On the up side, service was quick once we were seated, the beer was cold, food was cheap, the scene was worthwhile. Later, we went to the baseball game, and every other sandwich coming down the aisles was from the PNC Primanti's. Obviously this local eatery has a loyal following. Go ahead and try it. Once.",

(the surly woman later yelled at people in line saying \"DO NOT SEAT YOURSELF. THE LINE IS THERE FOR A REASON\" or something like that. she also yelled at patrons to keep the door closed.) the guy behind the counter gives us a look-at-these-f-ing-tourists look and asks us if we know what we want. we order. he doesnt write anything down, and surprise surprise, our order comes out wrong. i wanted slaw and my friend didnt. so that got mixed up. he also handed us the wrong sandwiches and said \"sometimes i mix things up\". yeah, no kidding, and i could tell he didnt give a crap either. i had no desire to even mention the mix up to the server. i just wanted to eat and get the hell out of there. my favorite part was when we asked for the bill and the guy stood and stared while i was trying to figure out the tip. oh and by the way, the sandwich sucked. i got the \"#2 best seller\" which was the cheesesteak sandwich. i wonder if this was a joke. the \"steak\" was like a crappy sausage patty. i added an egg on there, but for what? i dont even know. the sandwich was bland. the fries were meh. i left very bitter.  then, we went back late night. i am a glutton for punishment, and after all, we did drive 4 hrs to check this place out. the nighttime experience was much better. way less people. probably less tourists. we went to the other side of the restaurant and the guys behind the bar were very nice. ordered a kolbassi sandwich. it came out correctly this time. it was very good. much better experience at night. no complaints this time. but really though, this is the 1st time ive been to the same restaurant twice in one day. we got abused at 4pm and treated like humans at midnight. this place obviously has a \"we dont need your business to survive, so we'll treat you however we want\" attitude, and i dont appreciate that.",

    "text": "To preface this review, I'll come right out and say this was only my second time at this establishment. I held off on reviewing them the first time until I gave them a second chance.  On my first visit, the service was decent. Not great. Decent. Nobody behind the counter seemed especially thrilled about my presence, but it was also around midnight, and I wasn't going to judge them solely on that.  I asked what their most popular sandwich was, and said I would be going with that. It came out on time, which was delightful because I was starving. But the product that I received was honestly the blandest amalgamation of food stuffs I had ever ingested.  The slaw may or may not have been tossed in sauce. It might have been in the vicinity of a vinegarette, but it certainly didn't make contact. The fries on the sandwich were cold and unsalted. The bread couldn't hold together if it's very existence depended on it. I eventually just picked the meat off the sandwich and ate just that.  So all in all, the first visit left a bad taste in my mouth.  On my second visit, the service was more of the same. Guy behind the bar was clearly put off by me just sitting down. I ordered a beer and a pickle. I figured those were two staple items I would enjoy, which I did.  Upon finishing my snack and beer, I went to pay for everything, and asked how much my bill was. It was around $9. I was a bit shocked, and asked how much the beer was.  This is where the experience takes a dive.  He looked at me and said something along the lines of \"It was $7, which you would have know if you had just listened to me in the first place.\"  Ok, listen, I get it. You don't know what people are going through in their lives. You don't exactly get the opportunity to walk a mile in their shoes. But in the service industry, there is an expectation to show a modicum of respect to your customers.  I made a simple inquiry about my check, and this guy gave me lip out of left field. Totally uncalled for, and really disrespectful.  So, I felt the need to leave a review for what is considered a culinary institution in this amazing city, and frankly, it's a shame that the name Primanti Bros. is so intrinsically linked to it.",

I must say though, I was really bummed by the three cheese sandwich. I was expecting an oozy pile of melted cheeses on my sandwich - since the cheese is the only filling in this menu item besides the fries and slaw. But there was barely any cheese on my sandwich! Maybe two thin slices, tops! I couldn't even taste the cheese, it was so insignificant. I definitely won't get this again, but hopefully the veggie burger will be a better vegetarian option.",

Well, I'm disappointed in the sandwich. The coleslaw juice spilled out of the plastic container during shipping. It was wrapped in Saran Wrap. Not spill proof at all. Wasn't sealed. It made the box wet. I followed instructions and it's bland. Especially the fries. No flavor. Next day, I had it without the fries and made a Russian mayo spread for the bread. Toasted the bread with light butter. So much better. Added a side of pickles. Hubby likes the way I made it. I don't think I would try the original. Maybe if I have it at the actual restaurant, it'll be fresher and better. I wouldn't order again.",

    "text": "First things first; If you go, do yourself a favor and get a fried egg on whatever sandwich you order.  In my opinion, it's not worth all the Food Network hype and acclaim, but the pastrami is tasty, and bread is nice and soft and chewy. The fries are seasoned nicely, but don't the pleasant crunchiness that you'd want, particularly since they are being added to a sandwich where some crunch would be hugely helpful.  All that to say, if you are in Pittsburgh, it's worth making the stop out, particularly if it's later at night and you've had one too many.",

    "text": "If you are looking for something creative, something new, this is the sandwich place to try. The sandwich here are interesting for the fact that they don't have ordinary lettuce, but rather -- coleslaw. And in addition, they also add fries into your sandwich/burger. Making it extremely hard to bite into but worth the experience.   I don't think you can really go wrong with the menu, but basically if you are in doubt the waiters are all super friendly and would help narrow down your decision if one is needed.   Now I went with a mixed variety of people, so one of my friend was definitely hating on the place because she doesn't like to try new things, nor does she like to see something that's not lettuce and meat in her burger. I think that's why I want the emphasize on the fact that there is no lettuce or tomato replacements (but you can simply for a plain burger). They do offer to put fries on the side if you aren't comfortable with seeing fries in your burger though!  The eating process can be a bit messy but I guess that's part of the experience.   The immediate surrounding of the restaurant is pretty quiet area, a bit dead and smells like urine. Also under construction. So don't let that discourage you from entering, because the inside is completely different!",

This location has been serving sandwiches since 1933 and is open 24 hours, 7 days a week.  While visiting Pittsburgh for a work conference, my folks and I had lunch at Primanti Bros. My mom ordered a Vegetable Soup, which consisted of a mildly spicy vegetable broth with zucchini, carrots, celery, onion, tomato, kidney beans, and pasta. My dad ordered the Black Angus Sirloin Steak and Cheese. I ordered the Pastrami and Cheese with Whole Kosher Dill Pickles. All sandwiches came with tomato, potatoes (in the form of french fries), coleslaw, and onions by request. We requested cooked onions for easier digestion. You had the option to add an egg, extra cheese (such as Swiss, American, or Provolone), or extra meat (i.e., double meat) but we didn't. The sandwiches and pickles so big we had leftovers.",

So I had ordered the Pitts-burger & cheese, which is topped with fries, coleslaw and tomato. I also got a Pickle. I do appreciate the fact that the only modification to their sandwiches is whether to add onions or not - either get it how it is supposed to be or pick it off!  I do wish I had gotten the steak as it seems to be more of a favorite here, but the burger was good - I was surprised that it was lukewarm and very vinegary, but not surprised at the size. This easily feeds two and I had to take the rest home with me. I liked how snug and cozy this location is and how friendly everyone was. Next time I am back I would definitely come here and try more items off the menu. Hopefully with an eating partner, haha",

There was no hostess, just grab a table and someone stopped by to check on us soon after that.  We asked our waiter what was the most popular item and was told Pitts-Burger is the most popular item.  That's what we ordered.   There was no menu other than what was posted on the wall.  No prices listed.    The sandwich came on a piece of parchment paper.  The burger was big and it was hard to take the first bite.  The taste was very average.  The thin burger patty was cooked through and was pretty dry.   The Italian bread was fresh and tasted good.  Having cole slaw and sliced tomato on the sandwich gave it some flavor and made it more moist.  Maybe Pastrami or roast beef would have been a better choice.    There wasn't much service other than placing the order initially.    Not a place I plan to go back again when I visit Pittsburg again.",

The area is very busy- my boyfriend and I circled around the district a few times before we made an accidental turn where we crossed a bridge, and just decided we park there and walk over.  Things turned around when we got to PBs and were able to be seated right away at the counter- which was cool because we got to see the sandwiches being made.  We had great service- our waitress was so friendly even though she was incredibly busy. We each got a sandwich- I was so glad PBs has a veggie option of a bean burger! The sandwiches are extremely large- and loaded with slaw and fries. Everything was very tasty!  I definitely recommend sitting at the counter if you can.

    "text": "Location: Of much debate. The \"Original\" Primanti's is in the Strip District. Known to be a meal on a bun, they used to service workers (train/freight/trucking industry) in the middle of the night with their sandwiches. Sadly all locations are of the same corporate quality control. A Primanti's here will taste the same as in Florida or Michigan, complete with sides that never existed on the original menu.  Facility: To be fair here are a few of my favorite locations: Oakland: Great for a sandwich and tall beer to kick off a study crunch in the heart of Pitt. Strip District: A must do after late night clubbing or a good eat post 3a downtown walking distance. Market Square: Good people watching outside, lively with many tv's with sports audio. PNC Park: My favorite even without a horse in the race. Combine a Pittsburgher, Yeungling and a seat out of the rain and soak in the beauty of the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" skyline.  Food/Drink: At these original locations the menu isn't as chain-esque. You have pickle option, fried foods, egg add on (must do.) The sandwich is comprised of a processed beef patty, fries (not sure if fresh cut), tomatos (hit or miss on quality), and cole slaw (thick cabbage style also hit or miss on quality)  Drink: The No. 1 best seller. Tall pour, fair prices on beer drafts. Liquor is too expensive and under poured. A shot is 1.5oz no matter what your new ownership commands!   Service: In these locations these guys rock. They are hard working Pittsburgh folk who stand behind their product, stories of our city and have that friendly tough look that keeps the tourists in line.   Conclusion: If this is your first time in the city go to Market Square. It's the same experience without the Pittsburgh paraphernalia unless your already exploring the Strip (am must do)",

No unique taste at all with these sandwiches. Everything is served on the same boring French bread, with your choice of meat. The slaw and fries on the sandwich does nothing.

There was a long line wrapped around the corner of the building. It honestly moves pretty quick. I was a party of 3 and waited about 30 minutes outside. People are usually respectful that this is an in demand place, so they don't take too long to wrap up their meal and get the check. Once your seated, a waiter comes to get your order. I recommend starting with a beer while deciding which French fry stuffed creation to order. I went with the pittsburger - this was a thin hamburger patty with a heaping handful of fries and coleslaw piles between two slices of French bread- yum! I only ate half of this beast in the restaurant and took the other half home.. It's filling. Definitely a must try if in Pittsburgh!",

I must say I was fairly disappointed, Not only with my food which was average, but the entire place seemed extremely dirty. When my feet are sticking to the floor, that's a problem. They have limited seating on the inside, and they do have a covered patio area with heaters which was where we were seated. They pulled some tables together and accommodated us which was great. But the floor on the patio was literally so greasy and dirty it was very disgusting. The tables are patio table style, metal with holes in them. They as well we're not clean. I put paper towel down in my area just to be able to have a cleaner place to eat. Also used the restroom while there, (men's room is in the basement) and it as well was not very clean and smelled. If it were not because I was with a group, I most likely would have left. This establishment is known for their sandwiches, which all come with fries on the sandwich. A Pittsburgh novelty. I elected for a salad with Cajun chicken which was decent, but nothing to write home about.Several others had sandwiches which they all enjoyed. The service was very so so and we constantly had to ask for drink refills if we wanted anything. I never did get my second refill. Probably not a place I would go back to nor recommend.",

I opted for the Capicola sandwich and a Dr. Pepper last night.  The big deal about this place is that all sandwiches come with slaw and fries...in the sandwich! And let's be honest, the more fries I have the excuse to eat...the happier I end up. But the sandwich just didn't do it for me.  All of the elements separated were good, but all together were just bland.  I ended up pouring on some hot sauce and eventually dismantling the sandwich for the fries glued together by cheese.  Maybe I just needed mayo...  Cool little spot though - neighborhood joint still.  Good bar to sit and watch the Penguins play.",

If this is your first time visiting, I highly recommend visiting the original location in the Strip District as there's just something more magical about the experience. Take a walk around the place and admire all of the famous Pittsburghers from Mr. Rogers to Mario Lemieux.   Pro Tip: Don't order your fries or slaw on the side, you might just get yelled at!  Any time I visit Primanti's, I always go with the # 1 and # 2 seller. Iron City Beer and a Pittsburgher (Steak) sandwich. If you're really hungry, add an egg. Don't forget to add the Red Devil hot sauce, as it completes the sandwich.   It usually is packed on the weekends, especially on Steeler game day, but it's a pretty quick turnaround. Great sandwich, and great establishment!",

Got the double egg and cheese, and it was bland - absolutely no flavor whatsoever. Came here with friends who ordered the \"Ragin' Cajun\" and pastrami. They weren't impressed either. Both friends disliked the large pieces of bread. I agreed with them on the entire lack of flavor.   I don't know why people recommend this place, but they need to stop. This place is not good and not worth coming to. If they'd like to improve, add some FLAVOR to the sandwiches! Consider garlic, onion, spices, mayo, salt....these things are important in enhancing food.  Would not recommend to others.",

On the other hand, the staff was friendly enough and efficient for such a busy place. Don't expect plates or utensils.  (It's a great way to keep their costs down.) First time, I ordered a Pitts-burger. Meat was like a dry, flavorless hockey puck. Reminded me of school lunch 25 years ago. Second time I was there, had an Angus sirloin steak (not a solid piece or a pressed patty, as I expected, but more like chipped meat pieces piled together) and it was awesome! Delicious!  Saved my experience. Fries piled on top and I love the vinegar based coleslaw. Bam! Could eat it all day! And I tried my sons Colossal fish: deep fried heaven.",

I was worried a bit but didn't get sick. coleslaw was in a bucket that was on the floor, the bread was somewhere under the counter, the cook was cleaning the bar area after people left the bar area and used the same gloves to cook and prep the food.",

Staff: The service was top notch. Everyone in the staff was super friendly and courteous  Food: unfortunately, worst part of the experience. We got a Pittsburgher, a capicola and a pastrami sandwich. The opinion from all three of us was that the whole thing needed a bit more spices and salt. My capicola was supposed to be spicy but it was just totally bland.

So I got to try the Black Angus Top Sirloin and the Pitts-Burger Cheese Steak and my first thought was, they kind of taste the same.   I'm a HUGE sandwich fan and I believe the core of the sandwich should be the meat and 2nd should be the bread.  So with that said, my favorite part of this sandwich was the coleslaw.  Between the starchy fries, the large slices of the bread and fatty meat, the coleslaw was absolutely essential and I enjoyed it.  I just felt like the sandwich was bland and it was just one heap of food and bite after bite I was wanting the meat to stand out a bit more but I feel like the addition of fries kind of killed the sandiwch for me.  Not only did it add more grease to the mix but it also kind of made it seem like there was more bread (due to the starchiness) than there really was.   I'm not opposed to visiting again, but, unfortunately, I can't say I'm a fan.",

Afterwards, since it was around St. Patrick's day we  cruised the frat parties - stumbling along the Pitt campus, looking for the most obnoxious partying scene to join - cat fights, flashing, and belligerent green painted guys  -all major pluses.   After finding \"the one\" my friends spent the night attempting to play beer pong with brawny guys. One green beer after another....one high five after another...one spill after another....one \"hey, watch those hands\" after another.....it all came to a finale  - as my friend turned to me - his face matching the color of his beer and nodded. I understood. I grabbed my other friend, and we tripped over cups and half naked girls to the still snow covered ground outside - and painted it with our St. Patrick's day Guinnesses. YUCK. I was done......  The next morning - I was miserable. My friends were already all packed to go, both obviously lacking livers . I was in no such shape. I needed something before I could move, not to mention that all my clothes were ruined from the night before. The guy, who had put us up for the night, also out of laundry - provided some tiny running shorts, and someone  lent me some shoes (even my shoes were in horrible shape).     \"take these....just go to Primanti's - you'll be fine in a few....\" I didn't care what Primanti's was - I just wanted to die. But my friends nodded.   \"Yeah jess - get dressed - we're going to go to Primanti's.\"  And so...reluctantly....I put on an absurd outfit in the middle of freezing winter - white legs and all, and climbed into the car to Primanti's.  I kept on complaining, in between nauseousness that everyone would stare at my outfit in the middle of the winter weather.   \"no Permanti's is cool - they've seen everything.\"    They weren't messing around - within 20 minutes of a slowly eaten - to die for sandwich topped with french fries, fresh coleslaw, hot sauce, provolone cheese, and amazing thinly sliced turkey and Italian Bread....my stomach had settled and I was able to produce a slight smile.  \"no lie - this is the best sandwich I've had in awhile...I can't even taste the beer anymore.\"  And better yet, no one even flinched as I trudged out in my short shorts and clown shoes. Everyone was too engrossed in their sandwiches and discussing their crazy nights to care. Permanti's really is one of the best cure-alls for headache and nausea hell.",

That changed when two little events came together: I was taking the Megabus from Cincinnati to NYC and in between routes, needed something to eat during a 2-hour layover. And a friend who I met during grad school had just moved to Pittsburgh, so I proposed we meet up, and try Primanti Bros. Because Chris and his new wife could pick me up, I suggested we drive a little bit and head to the original Strip District location.  I was a little daunted as to what to order, especially since the menu was on the walls, rather than printed handheld, but decided on the roast beef sandwich. Very tasty, especially with the fries in it! I also appreciated the decor in the restaurant (I am a Penguins fan). The place wasn't too busy, so the atmosphere was relaxing.  If I'm in Pittsburgh again, Primanti's is a must for me (and you!)",

I have a high level of respect for the \"No BS\" hostess who was just trying to get everyone inside.  Of course, the idiots in front of us showed up with 12 people.  (Aside:  Look.  Don't freaking do that, alright?  You don't go to a place with a line out the door and ask to get 12 people seated.  Split up into smaller groups or something.  You're making life terrible for everyone else.)  And we're back...the sandwich was incredible.  Since every sandwich is identical except for the meat, the service is lightning quick.  From the moment we sat down, we had our food in less than 2 minutes, no exaggeration.    Of course it was delicious and something I've never had before.

But thanks to a local Yelp thread, I was able to move our last two trips to the Strip location--open 24 hours!  (And trust me, it's a much different crowd on Sunday at 2pm than Sunday at 2am.)  Plus it's the original, so there is history here.  But in the end, it's all about the food.    Thanks to that thread, we put egg on some of the sandwiches from trip #3 and tried some of the recommended meats--capicola and corned beef.  All was great advice.  Before I got there, they were ordering turkey and cheesesteak (both got thumbs-down from the thread posters).  Yes, this location is a little grungy (the restrooms are dreadful).  Yes, it is cash-only.  Yes, it is usually full or overflowing.  And yes, the waitress was surly.  So what?  It's one of the best sandwiches that you will ever eat in your life.

The food has gone downhill over the past couple years; to me it is overrated but out of state visitors make me take them there like its some sort of pilgrimage.  Any time you see a program on one of the travel or food channels and it has anything to do with Pittsburgh you know Primanti's is going to be featured.  This really doesn't do anything for the reputation of the place because it gets built up to be some kind of mouth watering experience when it really isn't.  If you are craving a sandwich like this go to the grocery store and get some frozen fries, toss some burgers on the grill and make your own coleslaw - it will be a fraction of the price and you won't end up with two thick ass pieces of bread.  I'd love to give this place more than three stars (and ten years ago I would have) but now it's more about getting customers in and out than it is making good food at a decent price.",

When our sandwich came out, it was gigantic.  Not sure, how one person could eat of it, but I guess American stomaches are bigger than Canadians.  Overall, the sandwich was ok, the hand-cut fries are a nice touch and I liked the coleslaw in the sandwich.  It was messy.  The steak was hidden with all the other toppings in the sandwich.

The steak itself would not be much to yelp over except that it is accentuated by heavy fries and a mound of slaw.  It is so stacked that you could almost use a fork to devour it.",

The first time I returned, though, I went to Primanti Bros. in the Strip District, and I've become a regular there since. Every time I pass through the Fort Pitt Tunnel when I arrive back in town, I make a bee line through downtown to the Strip District for a roast beef sandwich! The meat and fries are salty, and the cole slaw is tangy, and the two flavors work well together. It's basically a meal in the form of a sandwich, and I've never had one that I didn't like.  Sometimes I get the sense that many people who don't like Primanti Bros. are either gourmands who don't know how to appreciate \"bar food,\" or people who have some sort of problem with the culture of Pittsburgh, and thus target Primanti Bros. because it's promoted by the locals as the city's signature food item. But that's their loss. I think it's great bar food, and I've promoted it to people who have never been to Pittsburgh. One person I know from small-town south Georgia went to Pittsburgh a year and a half ago on business, and he tried Primanti Bros. and liked it a lot.  Next time I'm in Pittsburgh, I'll be back on 18th Street in the Strip District getting my grub on and enjoying life!",

He raved on and on and used words like 'amazing' and let us know that it would be the best decision we made all weekend. Yup, I was majorly disappointed.  I don't know if it's just me, but if I'm going to a sandwich shop, I expect some stellar or special bread. Due to the massive amounts of cole slaw on the sandwich, my bread was soggy and limp. Bummer. A guy at another table sat down right after us and I overheard him order his sandwich without the cole slaw. At first, I thought this guy was a novice, but after I ate it I understood why -- damnit. (Side note, I didn't even really like the taste of the cole slaw and I picked most of it off.)  I did however enjoy the french fries on my Pittsburgh cheese steak sandwich (the #2 most ordered sandwich. Never did figure out what #1 was) and had it just been fries and the patty, I would have probably loved it a lot more and given 4 stars. But me no like soggy bread :(  Adam Richman ate here and I have a huge crush on him, so I am happy to report that I ate in the same place as him but that's as far as my excitement over Primanti goes.  Also, after dining here I realized I have a really small mouth. I couldn't even get the massive sandwich in my mouth.",

We both got large sandwiches for about 8 bucks.  I'm definitely a fan, and will go back if I'm in town.  I wish there was a four and a half stars, that's what I would give, but, without that option, I have to round down, because to get a five from me is tough.  Nothing wrong with a four stars, and I would wholeheartedly recommend this location.  We got there late, and the server was awesome, great guy.  The atmosphere was great, and it's just so gosh darn cool.  Go!",

    "text": "If you want Primanit's, you have to go to this one. It's the original, and in my opinion the best experience. I think some of the other ones offer more menu options, but you can't beat the real deal. I've never had a bad sandwich or experience here, and the service is always friendly and quick. And not to mention, they make strong drinks too!   If you are new here and still unaware, this place is a Pittsburgh staple, it's been operating since the 30's, and is probably the most iconic Pittsburgh restaurant. Their deli 'sammiches' hit the spot, piled high on thick cut Italian bread with cole slaw and fresh cut French fries.   Don't like deli sandwiches? That's fine, they also have wings, pizza, fish, spaghetti, chili, nachos, and salads just to name a few. I honestly can't vouch for any of those besides the chili because 9 times out of 10 I can't resist ordering the traditional sammich! But I've heard from many people they're all good!   Another interesting thing, they don't take down orders; They've got this stuff down to a science! Even when they're getting slammed. And yes, they do get slammed; it's typically pretty busy around bar closing time since they are open 24/7. You have to experience that at least once to consider yourself a True Pittsburgher.",

The sandwiches were good but not great and the table service was simple and completely disposable. It seems that they skimp on meat while loading on all other topping however, this may have just been my sandwich. If your looking for a nice and swanky sit down artisanal sandwich shop this is not it. Also, it is generally crowded and small, and lacking any sort of ambiance. However, it is an honest working class bar with decent food at decent prices. But as a side note the bathrooms are down a long, steep, and narrow flight of stairs.",

Their signature dish is a deli sandwich with any meat you could imagine topped with provolone cheese, fresh cut fries, vinegar based coleslaw, and two fresh tomato slices. All packed into fresh slices of Italian bread. If that sounds appealing to you, it will be everything you imagine. If that doesn't sound your fancy, Primanti's also has excellent pizza, awesome wings, and some of the best loaded fries in all of Pittsburgh with the Smallman fries. Add in some quick, and unique service and you have a food legend that lives up to its name. Get a taste if you ever make your way to Pittsburgh.",

The size of the sandwich is \"above average\" but it is not the gargantuan monster that I was hoping to see. The roast beef is fine but it really isn't anything to write home about.

    "text": "I'd like to thank Primanti Brothers for finally giving me my official stance on a controversial opinion I've believed for years...  ..when they put french fries right on the sandwich it SUCKS. It always sucks. It always will suck. This place is suppose to be the best at it and its just not very good. People need to stop this \"emperors new clothing\" of French Fries on a sandwich being anything but a poorly executed gimmick.  The thing about French Fries is that they are starchy and flaky. I would assume the reason they became a popular side dish is because they are a good palette cleanser. You eat a french fry and then all the tastes of your main course is fresh in your mouth again.  Now, I expected Primanti Brothers to be different because they are supposedly the best. But I found their fries bland and undercooked. I got the steak and egg sandwich and I had to cover the whole thing with salt, hot sauce and ketchup. Then the sandwich was ok.  I will say the bread they use on the sandwich was great. Too bad they have to ruin their sandwiches with this idea that French Fries in the sandwich is a good thing. Its a gimmick and it stinks. Its as bad as bacon with desserts.  2 notes. 1st, this is the original location so you can't tell me that another location does it better. 2nd, someone told me that they are made to be eaten drunk at 4am. However, Gold Star Chili is good while drunk at 4am too. Proves nothing.",

    "text": "Yeah, I know, it's the famous \"Primanti Brothers.\" An institution in Pittsburgh. A rite of passage for locals and travelers alike. To be revered and spoken of in only the most reverent tones. I have several Pittsburgh born co-workers who know my love for food and recommend this as the \"best sandwich in the 'Burgh. Started as a 3 a.m to 3 p.m. food cart for nearby late night truckers in the 1930's, Primanti's has grown tremendously, and everyone, foodie or not, has to go there. Or so it seems. Adam from Man vs. Food; Rachel Ray; National Geographic - they've all been to the \"Shrine of the Primanti's\". Well now I have, too.  Although they have expanded to 20 stores in PA, and three in Florida, If I am making the trek, I might as well trek to Mecca - The original Primanti's in the Strip District, just a mile or so northeast of downtown. Brightly illuminated and highly visible with enough exterior neon to make a strip club jealous, the Strip's Primanti's sits in what deceptively looks like a \"rough neighborhood\". Nearby are a number of nice little restaurants and bars, and if you stay reasonably close, there is nothing to fear, appearances aside. Walking in you will find nothing special. Brightly lit with a food prep area and a couple of employees behind a counter with bar height backless stools on the left. A moderate amount of evenly spaced tables and chairs along the wall to the right and down the center aisle. The menu, as well as some minimally artful local sports depictions, are painted on the wall. There is a moderate selection of sandwiches, with soup, chili and fries available here. None of the Nachos, salads, wings and deep fried items that are available in the suburban stores. No, not here. No Potato Boats, Hoagies or Pizzas. No kids menu. Exotic here is chili and cheese on the side order of fries.  After sitting for several minutes in a relatively empty restaurant, I finally walked up and got myself a beer at the counter. I picked Iron City Beer, a premium lager from a local brewery, the Pittsburgh Brewing Company. The beer was pretty good for what it was. A working man's beer in the Pabst Blue Ribbon or Old Milwaukee style. Nothing wrong with that. It goes perfectly with the Primanti Bros. Experience. A Young's Double Chocolate Stout or something similar would be entirely out of place here, as would the person ordering it. I placed my order when the beer showed up. I stuck with a classic: Pastrami and Swiss. I was told - \"Sorry, no Swiss - only provolone.\" The menu mentions Swiss, but tonight, for some reason, it was only Provolone. Missing the sharp bite that Swiss provides, I pass on the cheese. Bread is thick cut Italian, no other option. Cole slaw and the fries (a Primanti \"Secret to their success\"), comes on there too, unless you ask otherwise. Onions on request - so of course - I request.   Served on a piece of paper, the sandwich doesn't look like anything special. I tear open a few packets of Grey Poupon, spread those around, and dig in. And the pronouncement on the Legendary Primanti Pastrami is ----Meh. Bread is OK, a little dry. The fries add nothing, they are better eaten off the sandwich. The slaw is fine, it's actually quite nicely seasoned, and there is a single tomato. The sandwich is cut in half. The pastrami itself? Pretty good, but not as much Pastrami on there as you would think upon first look. While the sandwich seems thick, the meat is more of a \"ball\" in the center giving the sandwich it's height, than it is a \"crust to crust\" adventure. It's maybe a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10. I would be disappointed if this is what I made at home and served to friends. And they would get it for free. Almost $7.00, and completely overpriced compared to an equivalent elsewhere.   Apparently a life changing event for some, I found myself deeply disappointed after all of the hype. Even based on the \"Diner or Dive\" scale, I was still less than impressed.  I leave, pushing past the semi-drunk crowd of younger folks pushing in for a late night bite. Perhaps they'll think it's great, I certainly did not. I wanted to, I really, really wanted to. But sadly, I did not. Sorry my friends, I tried.",

I was apprehensive at first about getting the cole slaw on the sandwich, because I'm not a big fan of cabbage or cole slaw, but it is a sweet and sour slaw that is different than any I've ever had and goes well with the sandwich.  The bread is what really makes the sandwich.  I know they get it from a local place, and it is so good.  The fries are always perfect.  Get an Iron City or a Yuengling to wash it down with and you have the perfect meal.  This location is always busy and a bit touristy, but it has more Pittsburgh ambiance than the other locations in town.  Nonetheless, you'll get a great sandwich, for a good price that is uniquely Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "I wasn't going to come all the way to Pittsburgh and *not* eat a Primanti's sandwich at the original location.  It's quintessentially \"Pittsburgh\" and apparently one of those things you love or you hate, you revere or revile.  Husband and I made three attempts to eat here.  The first two times, the line was out the door and down the block.  There's not a whole lot of food I'll stand on a long line for, and I definitely wasn't interested in squandering precious vacation time waiting to order a sandwich.  So we came back at 11 on a Sunday -- since this location is open 24 hours -- walked right in to an empty dining room, sat at the bar behind the flat top, and were eating within 10 minutes.  So?  I fall right in the middle of love/hate, revere/revile.  Most places give you fries and slaw on the side of your sandwich.  Primanti's puts them both *between* the bread, along with tomato and cheese.  This makes for a messy -- albeit convenient -- meal.  Husband and I split a tuna salad and the \"Colossal Fish,\" with a huge, deep-fried fish filet.  The sandwiches are incredibly filling, and they were good, but my mind wasn't blown.  It's deli meats and cheeses on bread they don't bake in-house.  Frankly, I think husband and I liked the mayo-less, sweet and sour slaw the best out of everything, even ordering an extra side of it to smother our sammies with.  I'm glad to have had the Primanti's experience.  But I couldn't eat one of those bad boys very often without a cardiologist on speed dial.

I normally go after work when the bars have let out so I know the timing and even see people I had to deal with that very night.  I love the corn beef Ruben. It's not a real Ruben but still a great remake of it. Piled with fries and coleslaw. The bread is always fresh and the food comes out fast. The worst part about this place is the drunks. If you can make it though them your in for an awesome hot sandwich for a good price.",

    "text": "I feel like Primanti Brothers gets quite the polarizing perception around the 'Burgh.  Either people love it or hate it, and I can see why.  When I first moved to Pittsburgh 5 years ago, I found Primanti's to be quite the novelty.  I heard about it from food shows, and I think that novelty value made the flavor seem that much better.  In fact, if I would have rated Primanti's the first week I lived in Pittsburgh it would definitely have been a 5 star rating.  The reality is this for me.  The food is good.  It's not amazing, it's not bad.  At the city locations, including the original one in the Strip, the menu is quite limited. Sandwiches, fries, chili, drinks.  The suburban locations have a vastly expanded menu, and I highly recommend the fried pickles, but since we are talking about the Strip location, I will stop there.  Since the sandwiches are their staple, and they have a large selection of different kinds, let's break one down:  Bread: Thick cut Italian bread.  It's tasty, but be forewarned that the bottom piece may get mushy, or just fall apart.  Tomato: Nah... I don't do these.  You are on your own.  Cheese: Run of the mill provolone? Can't really taste it amongst all the other flavors.  Slaw:  If you are an out of towner (aht of tahner), don't enter Primanti's expecting a mayonnaise based slaw.  This is a vinegar based slaw.  This caught me off guard on my first visit. Once you are over that shock, it's quite tasty.  Fries: Nothing special. Sometimes I wish they were a bit more crispy, but once you start digging into the sandwich, expect them to become a large mashed ball of starch.  Meat:  I can't grade all the meats, as I haven't had them, but personally I recommend the capicola.  It always is good, and has a nice little spice to it.  I do not recommend the Pitts-burger.  Despite it being their top selling sandwich, I found the meat to have very little flavor.  Bonus: Add an egg... it takes the whole sandwich up another notch.  Bottom line, if you come to Pittsburgh, you have to try it at least once.  If you move here, you may choose to eat it more than that.  I don't understand the hate for the place, but I also would never put it in my top 10 list of Pittsburgh restaurants.  Also, I love the history and grit at the Strip location.  It's open 24 hours, so for an extra people-watching treat, stop in some night after the bars close.  It's always entertaining.",

    "text": "A Pittsburgh Staple.  And apparently not just for tourists.  I have been to Pittsburgh a few dozen times. and almost every time, a stop at the original Primanti's on 18th St in the Strip District is a must.  Seeing how the reviews and pics have piled up here I feel I might be a bit redundant to say how awesome it is.  A one of a kind experience and sandwich goes without saying.  So let me talk about the personalities there for a quick minute.  The sandwiches as you see in the pics come on a piece of waxpaper.  That's it.  No utensils, no plates, just a squeeze bottle of ketchup and a piece of waxpaper.  So needless to say with the massiveness of these beasts, a mess is inevitable  A quick look at the napkin holder to grab as many as you can before anyone else at your table does, only to realize it's empty.  \"Miss, our napkin thing is empty, can we get some more?\" .... In a monotone voice, & an obviously not so thrilled manner, she replies \"They get filled once a day, before we open.  If they are empty, they are empty.\"  And then walks away as if we weren't even there.    All we had to do was steal some from another table, but still, pretty funny.  Another time a small, clearly Italian man tosses our sandwiches at us, toothpick hanging out of his mouth, he says \"there yas go.\"  Now I know \"yas\" is a NY thing, and \"yinz\" is the Pittsburgh thing, but this was definitely a \"yas\".    \"Excuse me sir, can we get a couple of forks?\"  In his best Chico Marx impression, he replies, \"What-cha gonna do witha fork?\"  And walks away.  Classic.  Wrap up;  A must!  Only gets 4/5 however, because as good as the food is, you can't help but leave there feelin pretty awful!",

    "text": "What's to say about Primanti Brothers that hasn't already been said?  I got the Pittsburgh Cheesesteak. I was unimpressed by the taste, but totally blown away by the food itself. As someone who can't eat a lot of bread, I found it still delicious when sharing with my friend. If i were to go again (which I probably will) I'll order the Reuben with an egg. That just sounds fun.  I also had the fries covered in cheese, chili, and sour cream. After reading other reviews about the bacobits I opted to not get those - I do have watch my figure after all! :)  The food comes quick. We go in, ordered, sat down, ate, and cleaned up within 30 minutes. Granted this was like a Thursday evening and I was going simply because EVERYONE said I had to go when I visited Pittsburgh, so I can't say it's like that every night. But when they're not busy, it's quick. When they are busy be prepared to order your food...properly. Apparently late night if you order incorrectly they'll kick you out of line and make you go to the back. Fair enough, drunk people gotta have their meat on bread ASAP. Now, don't ask me what \"ordering correctly\" means cause I don't understand. But I have a feeling it's like being rushed to order your hash browns at the Waffle House - smothered, covered, and diced please.",

I ordered what is claimed on their menu to be the #2 best seller, the cheese steak sandwich.  We settled in and enjoyed a couple cold Yeunglings and watched sandwiches get thrown together by some guy who didnt even look like he worked there. Our waitress never came back to get us another beer but when she dropped off our sandwiches I was appaled to see my cheese steak was a compressed pattie of tough flavorless meat.  I had to grab the waitress as she ran by and get her to examine it.  She assured me it was their #2 bestseller.  It was horrible and the Chili was watery.  I can say that the Pastrami was okay so there.  All in all it was definitely one of those places you have to go at least once and probably just once.",

While the service (people could not have been more hospitable), the food was disappointing.   The idea of the fries on a sandwich sounds like a great idea in theory, but in actuality it is not. I ordered the Salami with a fried egg on top. The sandwich despite all of these things on it was extremely bland. You need about a pound of salt to get any flavor out of it......",

    "text": "First off, as everyone may know, there's a lot of hype surrounding the sandwiches from Primanti Bros so it's always been on my list of places to eat at in Pittsburgh.  I came looking for a late night meal on a whim with my boyfriend so I got to avoid all the lunch traffic.  There was one guy at the counter, who was neither friendly nor rude. Just asked us what we wanted, served it, and that was that.  Quick and simple. I ordered the pastrami and cheese with an egg, because that was recommended by so many yelpers. I could have done without the egg, I could barely taste it since it was completely cooked under all that pastrami.  I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich though.  The portion was huge and it was definitely flavorful.  Between my boyfriend and I, we devoured the pastrami.  His Pittsburgher cheese-steak was definitely a disappointment, on the other hand.  It was just an underwhelming, sad cheeseburger with fries and coleslaw on top.  He ended up eating just one half and I shared the other half of my sandwich with him.    I would definitely go again if I were in the area late at night with munchies or something, but I don't think I'd ever go out of my way to eat there during the day, considering how busy it gets. It is definitely not my favorite restaurant, but I'm glad I went to try it.",

The sandwiches were okay, and the vinegar based coleslaw were quite interesting. However I found the fries to be rather tasteless which contributed to my lack of enjoyment in the food. Maybe I'll try it again and see if they were having an off day or I just picked the wrong type of sandwich for me.",

I went with pastrami and also threw in a fried egg for the full experience ($7).    I really wanted this sandwich to blow me away and it just didn't.  maybe it was because the bread was just sliced bread.  it wasn't grilled w/butter w/little bit of seasoning.  maybe it was that the coleslaw was a bit bland and not wet enough.  one thing that really killed the experience for me was that the fried egg was totally over cooked.  I was so ready for that drippy egg yolk experience and they denied me of it!   service was great...we were in there @ 4pm and it seemed like we missed the lunch crowd.  the prices are great.  bottom line:  this is late night after the bars food and maybe we needed a sweet buzz on to really appreciate the sandwich.

Both were quite passable, but the corned beef was much more of a standout, and I was left wondering what animal the steak had actually come from! We went before a Pirates game, so the dictum to come early was in our case very True. I'm guessing that would apply for most any major event in downtown Pittsburgh. Just off Penn Ave. in a former warehouse/commercial area of town, be sure to visit the candy shop (you'll wish you were 6 again!) or the fruit/veggie market across the street afterwards. Close to everywhere in Town, but seems like a whole different vibe from any of the other places around. Def go to the original, NOT the one in Market Square.",

I stopped in for lunch while I was in the area. The staff had a generally disinterested attitude and I practically had to wait on myself. I can deal with the Pittsburgh attitude, but the biggest issue here I witnessed as I was finishing my meal. Not only were the staff making the sandwiches with their bare hands (think of them sticking their paws directly in the slaw), they were also handling cash transactions in between. I'm don't consider myself a food-prep prude, but this is ridiculous and nothing short of a health issue. This is one of the few eateries in Pittsburgh that I will not return to voluntarily.",

    "text": "Years ago, while watching PBS, I stumbled across the greatest show I had ever seen. I can't remember the name but it was essentially one mans travel guide of American cities seen through their signature sandwich. This, before the food and travel network onset if foodie travel shows.  Needless to say, the chresesteak was prominently featured as well as NYC hot dogs and the Maine Loster Roll, to name a few. I immediately made it my goal to seek some of these gems out.  One that caught my eye was the Primanti Brothers sandwich in Pittsburgh. So much so that when a Pittsburgh road trip was mentioned by a friend, even though I couldn't think of any reason other than sports to visit Pittsburgh, I jumped at the chance and reasoned that at least I can cross that pile of deliciousness off my list.  I'll interrupt this review to say that there are many cool things to do in Steel City that I was unaware of, so put it on your \"To Do\" list of places to visit. I visited the Strip location, which is also the original.  Here, you have the option of a sit down restaurant experience or just grabbing takeout and or sitting in the cafe section. We chose to order at the counter and sit nearby to eat.   Based on my own preferences, as well as the suggestions of others ( both on Yelp and by other patrons there) we both chose the corned beef. It took a matter of minutes and I LOVED that it was delivered to us on a simple square of wax paper. A nice touch, that allowed us to be messy and able to be cleaned up easy afterwards. For the uninitiated, the gimmick of primanti bros is a hot coldcut sandwich on Italian bread slices with L&T and coleslaw and fries pressed in.  The Corned Beef Primanti didn't disappoint.  In my opinion, it had the perfect meat/bread/cheese/ topping ratio. It really hit the spot. I'd go as far to say that if we did nothing else in PBurgh, it was worth the trip.  My friend was a little nonplussed that their bathroom stalls didn't have doors but I didn't go there to poop, I went there to do the opposite! You should too! Put it on your bucket list and get your hands on one.",

    "text": "Primanti Brothers: What hasn't been said? Nothing really, so I'll just jump in with my two cents.   It's a great place to take people from out of town because 1. They always want to go here and 2. The food is decent and the atmosphere is entertaining. Those of us that live here, myself included, are understandably desensitized to the fact that all their sandwiches are topped with coleslaw and fries, but think about it: that's exactly the kind of bizarre and inventive combination that makes something as boring as a sandwich exciting.  And I love watching my friends wrestle with the behemoths (\"Is it shameful if I use a fork?!\") when they first get plopped down all bundled up in butcher paper with no instructions, explanations or apologies. I've tried the slaw and fries by themselves, and can safely say that you should stick to the sandwiches; the chili is a waste of time too.  The staff's attitude--brisk without being mean--is another big selling point. The row of old ladies behind the counter cooking up these monstrous creations laugh in a way that says, \"We're laughing at you, not with you,\" as you tear into those first giant bites. It's both a little embarrassing and charming. When I stopped in at 10 a.m. once the first thing the waiter asked me after I was seated was, \"Ready for a beer?\" It's the Pittsburgh experience-revel.  I've heard people complain that they're not as good as they used to be. I honestly don't know how they used to be, but here and now they're a pretty good sandwich, and yes they're famous, and yes the Strip location always has a million tourists under foot, but people from out of town don't mind fighting crowds-they're expecting it.   If you hate the wait (or you're just a hungry drunk) you can always take advantage of the fact that they're open 24 hours and show up at 2 am., or 3 a.m., or...you get the idea.",

For me it is the \"No. 2 bestseller\" cheese steak. Since all the other reviews tell you the sandwich ingredients I won't bore you with the details except to say that even if you don't like traditional coleslaw give Primanti's a try anyway. It really is special.   Primanti's has been feeding the working people of Pittsburgh for years and for years the sandwich has remained the same. It's great to know that know matter what happens some things in this world remain the same, and this stacked sandwich will always be one of them.   Some people have complained about the blandness of the sandwich itself. Though I agree that by itself it can be a bit bland, but there is an assortment of condiments you can add to spice it up. I prefer to shake on a little salt and some hot sauce before each bite. I've seen others use pepper and ketchup, and still others just salt and pepper. That's what makes Primanti's so great, everyone's sandwich is personalized to their own tastes and each bite is a little different.",

    "text": "Somewhere, smack dab in the middle of last week, Kay and I experienced Primanti's; Kay for the first time, and I for the first time since the summer of 1994 when I worked at the long-dead Three Rivers Stadium location while on break from college. It was at that location where I lacerated two of my fingers while trying to open a can of cheese as a Bluto-like managerial figure bellowed at me. 14 stitches distributed between a duo of digits became my souvenir. So yes, the feared Primanti's sandwich and I have a history, and I bear scars from the ordeal to this day. I'll show 'em to yas sometime.   While waiting in vain for an aborted concert to begin at an abortive venue, we came here to stifle our hunger pangs. How fitting it was for my next encounter, 17 years in the making, to occur at the original restaurant.  The Primanti's sandwich is contentious, cantankerous. Locals love it like a cousin who can't hold down a job or stay out of prison. Outsiders are often befuddled over it at best or are ruthlessly derisive of it at worst, even going so far as to use it as a vehicle to slander Pittsburgh and Pittsburgher alike. Defamers often view it as a microcosm of what they think is irredeemably wrong with our metropolis and its inhabitants.   This primary satellite hides on a side street that is easy to miss along the main drag. As you walk down the dark alley, you may feel as if a killer is lying in wait, hunched over, ready to pounce. Oily as a cobra, weightier than a bull, angrier than a wolverine, a Primanti's sandwich is an agitated rat's nest of a meal in itself, and remains THE razor-wielding maniac of a bar food scene littered with the corpses of its challengers.  And I like mine with corned beef, egg, and provolone.   There are gobs of imitators throughout the city, but this is the one True Primanti's; your choice of a slew of flat top-grilled meats, tomato, a tart, sauerkrautesque slaw consisting of nothing but cabbage, and a pile of rusty, hot fat-anointed fresh-cut \"potatoes\" all crushed between dense, dual cuts of Italian bread.   The fries are supposed to be brown. The slaw is supposed to have a twang. The bread slices had better be thick. The meat must be cooked through. Anything else, as tasty as it might be, is a fake.   Eating it is a backstreet brawl. Just when you think you've prevailed, it kips up, leaps at you, and keeps doing so until it just falls apart like one of Ray Harryhausen's animated skeletons only to come back to life! Paradoxically ramshackle yet indestructible, there's seemingly always more of it left to eat, and you want to eat it all so that you can say that you've conquered it or at least survived it.   Its appeal lies partly in its convenience borne of blue-collar disenfranchisement. To us this is is a delicacy, a novelty, one of those things to try at least once when in town. Since they were only allowed brief breaks, to Depression-era workers, this was essential nourishment and helped to keep them moving while trying to earn a meager living; lunch all in one hand. The labor struggles of yesteryear created the conditions that let us enjoy this sandwich as a treat and nothing more, and as a working man, I am grateful for that.   For the detractors, I pose these questions: Would it be more enjoyable (culinarily correct?) if the bread slices came from Pumpernickel and were cut into crustless triangles? What if the slaw was made of red cabbage, carrot shavings, and cilantro? Should brie, prosciutto, and heirloom tomatoes be used? Perhaps the potatoes should be sliced into medallions and sauteed in olive oil with garlic?  You'd like it more, especially if the alternative city paper critics did and if it was a NY thing. Don't lie.  Yes, and I will not stop saying this: There is far more to Pittsburgh dining than Primanti's. I was 19 years old before I had ever even heard of the thing, 20 before I ever bit into one (I got free sandwiches when I worked for 'em that summer) and went 17 years without having another.   It's slapdash. It's supposed to be. It's taunting you while you're having a wild time attempting to consume it. It's The Sex Pistols, The Damned, and The Stooges wrapped in wax paper with no plate because no plate=punk as hell! If you can't handle it, get out of the moshpit! Order quick! Don't putzy arahnd! Do you know what you want? If you don't, come back later, they're gettin' slammed 'n 'at! It's madness! I know firsthand! I used to smell like cooking oil and bread because all I did was slice 'n fry! I'd like to think it built character, something Primanti's has in spades.  P.S. I found the service to be acceptably efficient. No, they're not rude, they're just very busy. There were only 2 people on duty! Once 2 barstools opened up, we sat down and even chatted with the gal running the grill along with a gent from Chicago. We were served fairly quickly, and the kid running the place appreciated my tip. You get in, order up, eat, and get out, 24/7.",

I decided on The Pitts-burger (#2 Best Seller) and my husband had the Cajun chicken, which he enjoyed and ate every bite but I was very disappointed in the burger part of mine.  The meat had no seasoning, tasted like it was broiled or steamed (like McDonalds meat, blah...) and really ruined the experience.  I wish I would have tried one of the deli meats instead but will probably never give it a second chance.  The slaw and fries were both good - fries seemed to be fresh cut so I'm not sure why they don't make the effort to put out a better burger patty.",

The turkey sandwich I ate was great and I really dug the fries inside the sandwich (although I would have also enjoyed another huge mound on the side to shove into my mouthballs). Now, I normally wouldn't object to slaw in my sandwich either, but something tasted fishy about their slaw ... literally. It tasted like fish. I don't really know how else to describe it.  All aside though, not a bad sandwich and definitely not a bad price either. I feel a little closer to being a burgher, but it still can't beat Rubicon Deli in San Diego. That will always be #1 in my Cali heart.",

    "text": "How to have the best Primanti's experience:  (1) Bring cash. (2) Go hungry. (3) Be prepared to wait. (4) Add an egg to your sandwich. (5) Don't bother ordering anything other than your sandwich.  My favorite has always been a bacon, egg and cheese, but pastrami and corned beef are also must haves. The bread is fluffy and fresh; the fries are thick; the slaw compliments any combo; and, the overall effect is a whole tasty meal in your hands.  At off times, services is incredibly fast. During the weekend and late at night, wait times for seating and food service can be slow, but the wait is worth it.   (Side Note: If there's an old lady there selling baklava, try some.)  Whether it's 2am or after a long day walking through the Strip, Primanti's should be a planned stop for anyone.",

I keep searching for that perfect place, the one exactly like Red Hot Lovers in Ann Arbor but preferable would be mobile enough to follow me wherever I go so that when I get a craving I can just pop in.  The fries were good.  The chili was good but they were a bit stingy.  The thing that ruined it for me was that they used the fake velveeta cheese, the kind that never solidifies.  Oh Red Hot Lovers!  I miss you!  As for their sandwiches, I liked the fries and coleslaw combination.  Hot salty fries with cool vinegary coleslaw.  Yum.  However, given the ratio of fries (huge) compared to coleslaw and sandwich filling (pastrami & cheese w/ egg), sometimes it just tasted like a bland french fry sandwich.  When the combination in my bite was just right, it was fabulous, but they could work a little more on the ratios so it's not quite so potatoey.  Prob wouldn't be such a big deal if the potatoes weren't a little bland (yes, there are tasty potatoes but not in the 20 lb costco bags).  Def the hot sauce at the table helped a lot with the potatoes.  It's also a very messy sandwich.  Prob due to the cheap white bread.  But on the other hand it's also very large and you can share a sandwich and get a humongous dill pickle.",

    "text": "When I learned that I was going to Pittsburgh on business, before I booked my room or flight, I looked at the schedule and figured out when I could get to Primanti's in the Strip district. After seeing this sandwich temple on DDD, Man Vs.Food, Bourdain, and too many other shows, I knew it was a \"can't miss\". I'm a sandwich junkie, you see. The Hyatt hotel shuttle dropped me off and I was a little shocked at how tiny the room was. I learned later there was another larger room that was closed. I found a good place at the bar, and the place was blissfully not so crowded. There were two guys behind said bar who moved like machines, taking care of the entire place, and One of them was the cook. They were not chummy-friendly-talkative, but pro and attentive. They were too busy to bullshit.  The gal at the front desk of the Hyatt advised to get the \"Double Egg and Cheese\" I asked the guy who was nominally the Primanti's  Waiter what he recommended, and he said that it was all good, but his favorite was the Capicolla. I had taken a call from the gent I was in Pitts to see, and he also said \"Capicolla\", but with a fried egg. I'm not a big fried egg lover, but  as I am a fan of the \"Gabbagool\" I ordered it.. The guy behind the grill worked like lightning, slicing bread and throwing meat and cheese on the grill. Assembling sandwiches at all speed, I soon got my Primantis special. They serve on Waxed Paper-I watched the Waiter Guy carry 5 of the giant sandwiches at a time to a table. No dishes. Smart. Everyone knows (or should know) the scoop on Primanti's is the Fries and Coleslaw are all piled on top of the meat and cheese, between the bread. As I am a longtime devotee of Henry's Hot Dogs in Cicero, Illinois, where they, too, pile the Fries right on top of the Dog, I had no disconnect with the usual starchy side dish's  elevation to the main course. Any Chicagoan Gourmet worth his salt will also not blanch at the heaping of vegetables on top of a sandwich, as  \"dragging through the garden\" is the hallmark of any great Chicago Dog. Bring it on, Mr. Primanti. The first thing is flashed on was the bread. It looked like a normal Italian loaf, like the kind we get from Turano here in Chicago, cut on the bias to make a larger slice.  This bread had a different flavor-It was rich and I even detected a hint of sweetness. It wouldn't surprise me if there wasn't a Semolina component to the bread. The crust and crumb were tender. Fabulous fabulous bread. The coleslaw was simple-vinegar, pepper and a little sweet-finely shredded and tasty as hell. I've gotta say that I'm not the biggest lover of French Fries. I seldom order them, but as they are an integral part of the Primanti's joint, I embraced the spud. The Primanti's edition are fresh cut, fried fresh, and were actually very very tasty.  The Provolone Cheese and Gabbagool were fine but nothing special.  There is a gestalt thing going on here. The sum was greater than the parts. All together, the Primantis Sandwich was unlike anything I've ever had, and was totally enjoyable. The atmosphere was easy going-then again I was there on a Sunday evening. I'll bet it gets manic in there.  There are other Primantis in Pitts. and I was told the branches trump the Flagship, but I kinda dug the \"Strip\" District. And btw, the \"strip\" district has nothing to do with folks doffing their clothes. It's an entertainment/dining district. adjacent to Downtown Pitsburgh. I almost ordered a second sandwich, having layed low on intake all day knowing the Primanti's trip was nigh, but a second number would have been uncomfortable. I was still a bit peckish, so I ordered a few things that would not provoke guilt if I didn't finish. An order of the fine bread and butter, and more of the divine coleslaw. It was just the right capper. If I was going to carp about anything, it would be the small drink glasses-had to get a bunch of refills on my Diet Coke (which had a good throw, incidentally) Is it the greatest Sarnie I ever had? No. But was it a fine experience and a good feed? Absolutely! Solid 4 stars. Go there!!",

I understand that they may have been busy, but I almost expected a rat to scurry across the floor at any given moment. I don't think I saw anyone run a washcloth over the counters or tables the entire time I was in this hole.   Second, the service was God awful! There were 2 people serving/cooking. The guy came up to my companion and I, asked what we wanted to order, then before I had half a second to open my mouth and utter a sound the \"server\" walled away and served someone else. He did this no less than twice. I would have walked right out if this hadn't been the only place open to get a bit to eat within a reasonable walking distance from a concert venue I was attempting to visit. There was a woman making the food, and she didn't change her latex gloves between handling raw meat and cooked meat or rinse her hands when she handled meat to grabbing the coleslaw by hand. She seemed to know which orders were which, but the guy was having trouble keeping them straight. Maybe he could have TRIED to write them down.   And lastly, the food. I had ordered the roast beef and an extra side of loaded fries. The bread was hard, not toasted hard, stale hard. The beef was just OK, but not bad. But the fries, the staple of a Primanti sandwich, were disgusting! The oil that they had been fried in tasted like it hadn't been changed in over a year, which I am sure is not the case...I hope...",

But it is not just pastrami and cheese. It's pastrami and cheese between two pieces of sourdough bread, coleslaw, and fat french fries. At first, I had no idea how I was going to eat it since it was larger than my mouth could fit, but I worked something out. It tasted pretty much like heaven. I would definitely come back anytime I'm in Pittsburgh.  The location has a nice older diner kind of feel.

Hungry, and gross, we took our turns cleaning up in the hotel and got ready to go find some grub. Of course, Primanti Brothers was the first thing that was on my mind.  Upon arriving at the restaurant, which is hidden down an alley way that looks less than inviting late at night to those unfamiliar with the area, we chose our sandwich and began checking out the menu which was located on a giant board on the wall. Now, I have had a sandwich very similar to this in Chicago at Lucky's Sandwich Shop, so the idea of a sammy filled with french fries and coleslaw was nothing new to me.  However, I was anything but disappointed. After ordering, our food arrived promptly, hot, and was absolutely delicious.   With plenty of sandwich choices, and an overall cheap menu, there is really very little to complain about when it comes to Primanti Brothers. If you find yourself in Pittsburgh, with some extra time and a hungry stomach, I would highly recommend checking this place out.",

Walking in, you feel the local flavor. There was a firetruck parked outside. This place is simple. You walk in and can order at the counter or sit down. The menu is listed on the wall, huge.  Basics- Sandwich, Meat, Cheese, Coleslaw and Fries all between two pieces of bread. I tried the Pastrami and my husband tried the Philly Steak. I think mine was better. He did too. They bring you your meal on wax paper. No plates. Watch out, its a little greasy. There are no \"healthy\" options here just FYI.  Great place to people watch too.",

Being a Philadelphian, its easy for most Philadelphians to eschew any cheese-steak attempt by outsiders.  However, I'm not going to do that here since anything served on slices of white bread cannot be considered a cheese-steak.  This review is of a sandwich and not a cheese-steak attempt.  I had the angus cheese-steak.  I'd say taste wise, this is more of a two star place but they deserve an extra star for originality with the fries in the sandwich.  The fries (although slightly undercooked and very soggy) add an interesting dynamic to a sandwich.  The meat was very much on the small scale but was cooked just fine.  Overall, I'd definitely say its a place to be visited if you haven't had it before but I can totally see why my Pittsburgh native friend hadn't had a sandwich there in over 5 years.",

Now, this gets a 5 star rating for being really good at what they do...  great sandwiches with a local spin (cole slaw & fries).  Nice staff.  It was a little confusing trying to figure out if you have a seat and someone comes to you or if you order at the register and bring your food to a seat... still not sure which one is expected.  They were really busy both times we were there, which may have added to the confusion.  Will head back the next time we are in the area!",

    "text": "I moved to the Pittsburgh area for a few months' job assignment and decided to try the iconic Primanti Bros. before I left PA.  I visited the original location in The Strip.  I arrived a little after 2 pm on a Wednesday.  It was fairly crowded (not packed) right at first, but more people were leaving than arriving.  After a little waffling, I decided that one room was too cold, so I went to the other and pretty quickly grabbed a two-top by the window as a couple were leaving.  Soon a waitress delivered food to a table nearby and then stopped at mine.  I ordered an Iron City and the most popular sandwich.  Waitress: \"Cheese  steak?\"  Me: \"Yep\".  The online menu for PB suburban location calls it \"The Pitts-Burgher Cheese Steak (#2 Best Seller)  The original Almost Famous sirloin beef patty sandwich that feeds the spirited fans of Pittsburgh\"  The Iron City arrived promptly and was ice cold.  Good!  Very soon after my sandwich arrived.  Impressive looking.  I liked the slaw -- a tangy no-mayo variety.  (I hate mayo!)  I loved the fresh-cut fries.  (I never even bother to eat the frozen kind.)  The soft white sliced Italian bread was mild, fresh, tasty, and basically just stayed in the background.  The combination was winning, but I have to downrate the sandwich for one reason:  the meat patty.  I knew beforehand of course that it would be ground meat, not steak strips or shavings.  But I hoped for maybe a decent hamburger patty.  Instead it was this thing that I am at loss to describe.  Fine-textured mystery meat?  At least it was soft and easy to bite through.  I peeked at it and saw an obviously pre-packaged food substance that had those little cut marks all over it.  Pan-fried ground schnitzel?  It would be at home on a NY \"garbage plate\".  I'm not even sure it was beef.  It sorta reminded me of a Boca burger.  I quickly formed a theory about why this sandwich is advertised as \"#2 Best Seller\".  (Best seller is supposedly \"beer\" according to some reviews.)  This sandwich surely carries one of the highest profit margins for PB.  I have no doubt that it IS the most popular sandwich, but I suspect that the reason has more to do with the advertising than the quality.  People nearby were eating pastrami for the second time this week.  Another guy had corned beef I think.  If I ever return to PB I'll probably get one of those.  Maybe the Black Angus strip steak.  Unless you have a sentimental reason, or really insist on experiencing the least-common-denominator selection...  DO *NOT* ORDER THE CHEESE STEAK SANDWICH.  I think if you order something else you might rate PB 4 or 5 stars.  Taking the patty out of consideration, I LOVED the taste and concept of the sandwich.  But I just can't give a high ranking for a place that without warning serves the lowest quality meat.",

    "text": "So I found myself in Pittsburgh last weekend visiting an ex who was in town working at the Pittsburgh Auto Show. I recalled seeing a famous Pitt sandwich shop on Food TV and did a little research. I found that the original Primanti Bros. was down on 18th and decided to take a walk down from the Westin for lunch. I took the approx 15 min walk down Penn Ave and finally found the restaurant around a corner in what turned out to be the \"Strip district\". The Strip was crowded, grungy, ugly, and full of cheap ($3 & $5) Steelers shirts and \"Terrible Towels\". Something about terrible towels irritates me to no end (and Steelers fans in general, maybe because I had a roommate for a bit who was a total jackass and loved them...and I'm a Pats fan!). Street Vendors lined the sidewalks hawking mostly junk ($1 finger puppets!) as locals and tourists bustled around making Valentines day purchases. There were plenty of gritty locals selling flowers out of buckets and trash pals on the sidewalks in-between the cheap t-shirt tables. There were some cool shops and eateries bunched in, overall a scene I am not opposed to at all!  So I got to Primantis, opened the door to see a line right in front of me about 15 or so deep, I found the end and began to wait. A family coming in behind me were obviously Primanti virgins as well and asked me 20 questions about what to do now that they were there. After about 20 mins I was at the front and was shown a seat at the bar. I was delighted to see Yeunling Lager available as it brought me back a few years. It is brewed in PA and FL, I worked on a trail crew in FL for a bit and would buy plenty of it with my $40/week stipend, actually beer was all I bought on that money The beer is not available in CT or MA to my knowledge. I started on my bottle of Yeunling and got an order in 15 mins or so later. I chose the regular sized 'fish and cheese'. I do not eat 'meat' otherwise I would have gone for the steak or pastrami that seem to be the favs. I soon discovered the couples on either side of me at the bar were also new to the place and had also seen it on Food TV and had made it a destination. Have you had one??? they asked with a tinge of excitement and curiosity in their voices!   About 20-30 mins later we all found out what the fuss was about. Well the sandwich didn't look as magical as I would have been led to believe with all the out of towners ooohing and ahhing but it looked good and I was hungry. I squeezed down to prevent filling leakage and bit in....mmm. Now I'm not a cole slaw fan but it was obvious upon first bite the slaw made the sandwich. I can't lie, being that the only animal I eat is fishes and almost all of my friends and coworkers eat meat I am ordering a fish sandwich pretty often at places I don't necessarily choose but go to frequently. So french fries and fried fish has to be pretty special to surprise me, these did not surprise but throw them together with the slaw on the white Italian bread and you have a very tasty sandwich. The fries were slightly soggy, not salty, not hot, limp and bland would describe them well with a pleasant taste. The taste of the fish did not stand out much over the slaw, The slaw was exclusively cabbage to the best of my memory. It was tangy and acidic and packed a flavor punch compared to the bland fries, bread and fish.   The sandwich was messy and losing components on each bite, which fell onto the deli paper it was served on. Luckily the napkins were right in front of me and became a hot item with the neighbors as well. Normally I don't like a loose, avalanche prone sandwich but it did not bother me here as the 'sloppiness' was part of the charm. The waitresses carried piles of sandwiches around separated only by the deli paper. The room had a warm character and felt like people had been enjoying warm messy sandwiches and beer there for a long time. It was slightly dark and extremely crowded, but not a bad crowded as everyone was happy to be there eating a famous sandwich. When you are done you walk to the end of the bar, tell whoever happens to be standing there what you had (honor system!) and pay under $10 for a sandwich and a beer!   On my way out I ordered a sandwich to go as I was meeting my ex on her short lunch break. I grabbed her the 'Rajun Cajun Chicken\"  which she enjoyed but commented on the soggy nature, which I am sure was compounded by being wrapped 45mins previous to being eaten. When I walked out the door there was line wrapped all the way to the side of the building approx. 50 people deep. I believe it was snowing at this point and in the 30's, so I was impressed by the will of the people to obtain sandwich royalty. In the end I thought it was a fun experience and a tasty sandwich. If I am back in Pitt I will certainly consider going back for a bite. If I am eating meat again at that point I would anticipate being more delighted by the Primanti Bros. Check it out, embrace it.",

Being a woman by myself in a town I'm not familiar with, this place was quite a challenge to find.   But I had to go to the original or why bother?  I had seen Primanti Bros featured on TV and it seemed like a really intimidating place to order and eat.   However, when I walked in there it was very casual and inviting.  I sat at the counter and ordered a roast beef and cheese with a Yuengling, and I watched as the cooks created my monster of a sandwich.    I'm not a big fan of \"stuff\" in my sandwich but I was hooked by the first bite.   The roast beef was extremely juicy and soft, the coleslaw had the perfect tang, and the french fries were simply a fried bonus of goodness.  I would probably be about 500lbs if I lived in Pittsburgh because I would be eating there all of the time.  So good!",

We entered the pub style place and were looking forward to some good food.  Our server was great. She was attentive and on the ball, but the food was awful.  We both ordered sandwiches with the fries \"not in them\".  We got our goods and had a very hard time finding any meat in the mound or coleslaw.  We then realized why they put fries in the sandwich..to make you feel full and nothing more.   The sandwiches were lifeless and fries on the side soggy.   We opted for the loaded fries and they said \"bacon\" with cheese and chili on top, but they were actually Bacon Bits! Little hard crunchy, meatless crisps!  Awful food here and we couldn't get out of there fast enough.  Cheers to our nice server though!",

Waste of money, time and calories.   Far overrated. I dont understand why this place get's so much attention. The take away is that these are BLAND, messy and boring creations.   I tried the cheese steak, which was recommended to us as their best seller. The meat was tired and dull, the coleslaw was sub par (ive had better at the grocery store), and the french fries were boring and soggy. If this place is going to be famous for stuffing french fries in to their sandwiches then it should make sure those fries are phenomenal. These are not - not even close.   I also tried the chili cheese fries. I literally had about 5 bites and couldnt take it anymore. A soggy, sloppy and disgusting mess. Dont get me wrong, I love sloppy food when it's done well, but this was just a disaster. Maybe adding bacon bits adds character to food, but it doesnt add taste and it was a bad idea on this concoction.   Seriously - they make their money by out of towners like me who hear how great it is on TV and who convince themselves its going to be great and tell others. It's a vicious cycle that breathes life in to bad food. DONT DO IT! PS - nice people though.  Oh yeah....by the way...if you are going to be a \"Pittsburgh Institution\" and franchise your crappy food then you can at least get a card swipper for your IPhone and accept credit cards.   It's this kind of mind boggling stupidity that makes me wonder why this HORRIBLE place is still in business.",

I am from Chicago and I have been to Philly so I was expecting the Italian beef and Philly cheesesteak equivalent of Pittsburgh instead I got the MOST bland sandwich I have ever had. We tried the sirloin and cheese and the so called #2 rated pittsburger sandwich and we were disappointed.   There was barely any meat and all I tasted was fries. The coleslaw was bland. I don't know how a sandwich with meat cheese and fries have no flavor?! The pittsburger was even worse! It tasted like a Salisbury steak you get at the super market put in a piece of bread.  Over all very disappointed in this place. I ate my sandwich coz it was late and I was starving but I feel disgusted. The service was nothing exceptional either. There were no lids for the drinks which was weird.  Would not go here again or recommend this to anyone.",

I do with they had more vegetarian options for the vegetarians who like to eat here. It's also a little tough trying to feed a little kid here. Usually we get our kids fries or soup/chili. The suburban locations can cater to kids a little easier with pizzas and finger food appetizers. So we don't visit as often as we used to now that our kids are picky eaters and just arent' crazy about sandwiches in general. They'll get there, they are pittsburghers. But we love this place enough that we rented their back room for our rehearsal dinner private party. We figured all our out of town guest would end up there anyways, so why not. They loved it.

Maybe the wonderful drinks from Maggie's Farm Rum helped us make that decision.  Even at 2:30 pm on Saturday, it was packed. I would have expected this around lunch, but didn't think it would be so crowded that late. We only had to wait a couple minutes to be seated.The tables are pretty close together so you feel really packed in there. Our order was taken quickly and food arrived fast too.  My boyfriend got the fish sandwich(without coleslaw) and I got the Pitts-burger. The fries are crispier than I expected. I thought they would be soggy from the coleslaw, but they weren't. The coleslaw is vinegary and there was lots. My boyfriend's fish was crispy and hot and delicious. There are better fish sandwiches in Pittsburgh, but this one can definitely fill a craving. The burger was a little disappointing. It was more like a weird meat patty than a burger, and after trying the fish sandwich, I realized how cool the meat was. It was like they just pulled it out of a bin.  The bread was really good. Soft and fluffy, but it sort of seemed like the bread wasn't substantial enough to handle the large sandwich. But maybe it's a good thing since the sandwich would be too filling.  It's a good place to take out of towners to try and worth trying every now and then just because Primanti's is Pittsburgh, but it's not the best food you can find.",

The fries were super soggy, the bread is like a soft white bread, the kind where your fingers make imprints upon touching and the thing was all slaw. The pastrami was ok (my man liked it much more than I did) and the Pitts'burger' was definitely a let down, all I tasted was that slaw and bread. It was cheap for 3 sandwiches the meal rang up to to $21 and some change but, I, who never leaves a plate empty left half of a sammy behind.   Looking back I bet the colossal fried fish sandwich would be banging with the combo of slaw and that white bread but for the other sandwiches, they were just nothing special. I wouldn't recommend as a place to try when visiting Pittsburgh and friends in Pittsburgh, no offense but, come to NJ and I'll show you a sammy.  * Cash Only. ** Open 24 hours - which is pretty awesome, I'll give it up.",

We were in town for a Pirates game(we go to a few different stadiums each year) and wanted to try this place out.  Of course we had to go to the original. Being a good diner, I had scoped out the menu 1st online and kept seeing \"our #2 seller\" but never seeing number one.  So like any dumbass tourist, we asked what the number one seller was and she said \"the beer\".  I may as well have been wearing a fanny pack and a hawaaiin shirt at that point.    I ordered the pastrami sandwich and Yuengling.  The beer was cold and pastrami was hot!  In case you don't know about Pirmanti's, the sandwich is an entrie meal.  It comes with what ever sammich you pick and then cole slaw and fries are on the sammich itself.  It's huge.  Sounds like a novelty but it works.  The crazy thing about it is it's only like 6.88 for this ginormous meal.    There are about 50 different combinations of this sandwich and if I lived close, i'd try them all.",

I was expecting to have the most fantastic sandwich I have ever had but it was the most bland sandwich I have ever had.   I ordered the pastrami and there were a few scraps that didn't taste like anything.  The sandwich came with a PILE of French Fries and a PILE of coleslaw on the sandwich.  I would have preferred the French Fries on the side as they were pretty good fries.   As for the coleslaw it was good but I do prefer the creamy style coleslaw.  The bread they use is fantastic!  My husband had the #2 steak burger and it did have a little flavor but still not that great.  He ate his sandwich as prepared and didn't dissect it like I did mine.  Even dissected it still wasn't that great.  The service here is NOT good or welcoming.  It might have been better if the poor girl serving us had a little more help.  The sandwiches came out fast however, if you need anything else, don't bother to ask unless you want to see some attitude.    I guess if you are interested in an \"experience\" this would be a place to go when you are not really hungry.  I wouldn't come back here personally nor would I bring anyone here.

I've been here a couple of different times, and the truth is that I think it's a bit underwhelming for the hype that it's given by locals.   My first time here I got the classic Pitts-burgher sandwich, and I didn't really enjoy the fries and coleslaw piled onto the sandwich. There, I said it. It's just too many flavors going on at once, and I would prefer to have a side of fries rather than have them mashed onto my sandwich so that I can barely taste them. Ever since that first experience, I've asked for my fries and coleslaw on the side (much to the dismay of the waitresses, who look at me like I'm insane for not wanting them on the sandwich). What can I say? I'm from Cleveland. I just can't get into a sandwich piled high with things I usually eat as sides. After trying a few of the different sandwiches, I just don't find that they're anything to write home about. I enjoy the fresh bread of the sandwich, but that's about it. The fries are always a little soggy. If it's your first time in Pittsburgh, I absolutely recommend giving it a try since it's such a Pittsburgh classic. I just don't think I will be rushing back any time soon.",

The sandwiches are a little large b/c of the pile on of cole slaw and fries.  Let me start with the bread - it's plain white bread.  Nothing special...at all.  The slaw was decent but there wasn't enough of it.  The fries were the worst part of the sandwich!  I love fries but these things were completely tasteless.  They were just soggy and bland.

The only unfortunates were that it's really touristy now ( hence the reason I even knew of the place ) and we had to wait outside in extreme heat before getting a table, and there was no AC and I was having some serious heat sickness going on due to the fact that we weren't beneath a ceiling fan.

    "text": "I went here with three friends after a Pirates game on a Saturday night in July of 2004. It was the last stop on a weekend baseball roadtrip from Baltimore to Philly to Pittsburgh and back to Baltimore.  My three friends at at one time or another lived in PIttsburgh. Two of them had been here before (Dave and Robert) and the other one (Jerry) who lived there at the time had never been there (like me). We sat at the counter and ordered Iron City beers (what else do you order when in Pittsburgh?) while we looked at the menu.  The waitress/barkeeper came over to take our order I decided on the roast beef and cheese... Dave had the pastrami and cheese Robert had the capicola and cheese Jerry ordered the fish and cheese... \"Fish....no one orders the fish!\" she said. We all kind of smiled...except Jerry \"It's on the menu\", he said. \"That doesn't mean you have to order it!\" She took the orders and went back to the kitchen. Jerry, \"Geee...she was kind of gruff...\"  We all laughed and told him that he shouldn't have ordered the fish! :-) She came back in a little while with our sandwiches, we probably all ordered another beer...except for Jerry. He wanted to go...;-) So we finished our sandwiches, except for Jerry... \"Can I have a doggie bag?\" \"A doggie bag?\", she says. \"I want to take the rest home for my wife.\" \"He orders the fish, then he wants a doggie bag to take the rest home to his wife! You need to eat that sandwich, you're so skinny that  if you stood up too fast you might hang yourself as you fell through your underwear!\" At this point Dave, Robert and I were dying from laughter...Jerry wasn't. :-) Jerry got his doggie bag, we left and he put it in the car as we went bar hopping....  Story aside...the sandwiches are very good and very filling. I am thinking that our sandwiches and two beers came to around $15 or so. Well, Jerry's bill was less...:-)) We all tipped the server well for such an enjoyable meal and Primanti's expereince...except Jerry. ;-)  I posted some photos as well...:-)))))))))))",

The restaurant was a dump and we had not even ordered our food. I can forgive the ambience and rudeness if the food was good, but as you can tell by my rating it was awful. I ordered a cheese steak (#2 seller) and the meat was a brick patty that tasted like processed or canned meat. I am not a fan of coleslaw at all so I asked for that on the side. The rude waiter brought my everything out on the side. Picture this a slab of meat on some soft bread with cheese. Attention to detail in my order goes a long way. I attribute that to him being rude so I'll let that slide. I will say, considering I am not a fan of coleslaw that was the best part of the meal. In other words that was the only thing I ate. Considering I can pretty much eat anything, this place was just terrible. Oh ya, this place only takes cash. Stop being cheap and if you are a chain restaurant then have the option for credit!! Otherwise you go to their ATM in the restaurant and pay the 3.50 service fee. Would not recommend this place to anyone.",

You could also just walk up to the cash register and order to go, I suppose, if you didn't want to wait. It is pretty tiny inside, but they have TV's with sports on. The noise was average. The staff was super friendly and despite how busy it was, they were very attentive. We sat at the bar and really enjoyed our meal! The staff was good at suggesting what was the most popular and their favorite. We tried the pastrami sandwich and it comes on Italian bread with coleslaw and french fries in it.

The first sandwich I got was the pastrami, which was loaded with it and pretty good. The second sandwich I had was the Pittsburgh Cheesesteak, which was just okay. The problem I had with the sandwiches was that the fries kind of overpowered the rest of the sandwich, and they weren't very good.

I went here after hearing of the\"legendary\" sandwiches and will never go back. I was even served a skunked Yuengling and was told it was fine when I mentioned it didn't taste right to the server. The server then threw a sandwich on wax paper across the table with bread that fell apart as soon as you touched it. Next time I won't bother and definitely don't recommend.",

I'm so glad we decided to split a sandwich (we ordered the Cheese Steak). Basically, they stuck a hamburger bun in-between two pieces of white bread. Add to that, some very mayo'd up coleslaw and soggy fries. Overall, I was just very disappointed.  Conclusion: FATHEADS is where it's really at!",

I wound up getting the pastrami sandwich, and I didn't care for it much at all. For about $7, you get a DECENT size sandwich - not nearly as big as what's shown on MvF - with DECENT flavor. Not a great value, and not the best sandwich in the world, but if you've seen Man v. Food, I'd recommend going just to say you went there. Really though, don't expect anything mind-blowing - Adam definitely overdoes his reaction on the show. Absolutely average.",

I have to say, I actually enjoyed it very much.  We got there a little after noon. I expected it to be wall to wall people with us waiting for forever. Instead, we walked right in and sat down at the counter. Perfect.  I got the capicola and cheese with an egg added on. The first bite was actually surprising because the coleslaw was unlike anything I've had on a sandwich before, but by bite two I couldn't get enough of it. Delicious. The fries and bread are a bit soggy, but it all seems to work.  If and when I go back to Pittsburgh, I'll probably eat here again. Pretty good sandwich. I gave it the extra star because it's a cool experience, even if it is a little touristy.  One thing to be aware of that is incorrect on Yelp as of right now - this place does NOT accept credit cards. Cash only. Be prepared.",

I arrived a little before 11:00, a little early for lunch but too late for breakfast (which, according to the sign, ended at 10:30).   I sat at a table right across from the counter, and ordered a pastrami & cheese and a diet coke.  I got my drink, but my sandwich never made it out.   After almost 20 minutes and seeing several people who came in after me get their food, I got up and went to the counter to ask about my sandwich....for which no ticket could be found.  I was told that they'd get to work on it right away, so I sat back down (nobody EVER came back to check on me once my drink was delivered) to wait.  While I was waiting, I got out my wallet so I could go ahead and pay for it, since I'd been waiting a while, at which time the owner came out and asked me if I was waiting for my check.  When I told him I was still waiting for my food, he proceeded to start yelling at everyone behind the counter, telling them to get my sandwich (which they were already doing).   A couple of minutes later, he brought it to me personally.    The sandwich itself was a bit of a letdown.  The bread was fresh, but the ingredients were nothing special.  And the whole thing fell apart as soon as I tried to pick it up, so I ended up eating the fries on the side, just like I normally would, instead of as part of the sandwich, as was intended.   I only ate half of it, tossed the other half, and left feeling somewhat let down.",

Absolutely mouth watering and filling.  The price is right, the wait was non-existent on a weekday and the service at the bar was prompt.  You have to try this location, as I can tell it's just overall much nicer than the other location I went to previously (southside---argh that Primanti was like a dump compared to this one).  The overall environment is actually inviting.  Just a nice place to hang.  This place drops a star because they don't have Tabasco sauce.  Only Red Devil.  Nothing wrong with Red Devil, but seriously, they need to step their game up in the hot sauce department.",

Fast-moving line outside under the awning kept us relatively dry.  I got an IC light and a pastrami and cheese.  Wife got sweet sausage and egg.  First half of the sandwich was excellent, I couldn't put it down. I couldn't put it down anyways fearing half the stuff would fall out.  By the second half, the fries start to get a little heavy, and slightly dries out the sandwich.  Ketchup and hot sauce on every table helps the rest slide down easily.  Pastrami was definitely better and more flavorful than the sausage. Will return when I reach pittsburgh again.",

Having been to Primati's many times have learned to get some of the meats that have a little bit of zip/taste so ordered the capicolla, and the sandwich came out hot and the capicolla was very good.  The slaw had a tart taste and went well with the sandwich, my only grip is the fries, why are they so eh and so soft and mushy.  Yes the Italian bread was good and yes the sandwich got a little soggy and the bread started to get little hard to handle and break apart. But that is all part of a Fun Experience of Primanti's.",

They run a tight ship - no plates, no credit cards, but good food and an extensive selection.  They are even accommodating for little kids and will do a grilled cheese sans slaw.  I've never had bad service or a bad experience and will gladly go when the lines aren't too bad.  It's a good, solid pub food experience.  Expect that, and you won't be disappointed.",

My first taste was at PNC Park where they have an express version, but I must have had 10 to 20 people tell me that I must also try the original location in the Strip District to get the full experience.  So...at about 2am after a night of bar hopping, I wandered down through the warehouses and found myself in a packed restaurant.  I'd tried the roast beef & cheese at the ballpark and decided to try something different at this location.  I was disappointed when told that there was no more tuna, so I settled on the ham, egg & cheese.  Loaded with slaw and onions, I scarfed this monster sandwich down with ease.  Like the one at the ballpark, I found it to be good, but not great.  For me, the slaw is a bit overpowering and the soft bread makes it a huge mess to eat.  I'd order one again someday, but probably go with the black angus steak & cheese.  According to my last taxi driver, he claims that it's the best.",

One thing: even when it was super busy and we were waiting for a while, the servers really hustle to get you what you need. One night the whole place was packed with one guy working the grill and the other guy in charge of the bar, tables, and register. He wasn't perfect but he was damn good.  The pastrami is my favorite and I highly recommend. You just can't go wrong with salty meat and fresh cole slaw in a sandwich loaded with fries. The downside is the Italian bread can get a bit soggy, especially on the side the sandwich is laying on. Very filling, even for a big eater. Sometimes I can only eat half. I like to get the whole pickle too, but it is large. 4-6 spears and I have to believe it's more than one pickle.  The biggest issue I have with this location is the bathroom. It's down a steep set of stairs and it's a big ol' effort to go. Also, they are not great about refills. Not sure if these things are related...  All in all, good food, good price.

I'd gone about 1200 of the eventual 1700 miles that I was due to go over a 72 hour period.  I put out the word on Facebook that I had an hour and a half layover in the Steel City and needed to go into town and get something that wasn't wretched from Chateau Greyhound.  I got a couple of replies from former residents and people that had also gone through. They said that I needed to go to Primanti Brothers for a sandwich.  I was skeptical that a sandwich was going to make my day, as was suggested, but it wasn't very far and it had to be better than what was waiting in the terminal.  Boy were they right!  I walked about 10 minutes down the street and came into the restaurant just before the Pirates won a game.  There was a buzz in the place, but it wasn't too packed.  I bellied up to the bar and asked for a local beer or drink, as is my custom when going to a new city or town.  They gave me an \"Iron City Beer\", which was nice and tasty.  Then I mentioned that I was from New York, that I had about 12 hours to go, and that I'd heard good things about the sandwiches.  They suggested I try the pastrami with onions.  Sounded good to me so I dove in.  I love how they served the tasty sandwich cradled in just a couple of sheets of wax paper and not a plate.  For some reason, that said to me that they knew they didn't need to dress this thing up...just get it to you and let you have at it.  The bread was perfect...soft, fresh, and not fall-apart-y.  The slaw that was inside wasn't overpowering.  And the 6 french fries that were put inside the sandwich were just plain perfect.  All that with the beer made me want to miss the bus and just hang out with the steadily increasing post-baseball crowd...but I thought better of it.  I tipped 3 bucks on my 10 dollar meal and told them that they had no idea how good that the place was and that I had to find a way to let folks know.  So keeping my promise, I took and posted pictures on FB for my 1000 plus friends to see, bragged about how much better the sandwich seemed to get along the ride in my belly, and just joined Yelp and made this my very first review ever.  Primanti Brother...you rock!!  If I'm ever back in Pittsburgh, there's no way that I won't be going back to see you.  And I'll also make sure to tell anyone I know that's coming to town to check you out.  Keep it up.  This St. Louis transplant to New York City had a great short time, and loved the place!",

    "text": "If I could think of the perfect word to describe Primanti Brothers, that would be, \"underwhelming\". VERY underwhelming. I'm a little upset that the Travel Channel hyped it up so much on Man v. Food. They made it sound like the perfect sandwich. French fries AND cole slaw IN the sandwich, with meat (and tomatoes)? What's not to like about that?  Unfortunately, the best part about the sandwich was the cole slaw, which I actually really liked. I ordered the pastrami and cheese, which is pastrami with cheese, tomatoes, cole slaw, and french fries. The meat wasn't bad. It's no Katz's, but I wasn't expecting it to be. It wasn't great either. It almost tasted like any other sliced pastrami I would get from the cold cuts section at a deli. The french fries were soggy and flavorless. The bread was super soft and could barely hold the cole slaw together, let along the rest of the ingredients. By the time I was a few bites in, the bread was already smushed and lost into the rest of the sammie.  My boyfriend ordered the Pitts-burger which boasts itself as its #2 seller, but nowhere on the menu does it say what #1 is. So I asked the waitress (who seemed like she hated life, or at least hated Primanti Brothers) what #1 was and she responded with the Pitts-burger. Makes no sense but okay. He went with it. The Pitts-burger is the same as my sandwich but instead of pastrami and cheese, it's a hamburger patty. An old-tasting hamburger patty. I'll leave it at that.  We also order two Pittsburgh beers. I forgot one of the names (but it tasted like Miller Lite), but the other one was called Steel City. I think this brewery might have taken its name too literally because it had an unpleasant metal aftertaste (to no fault of Primanti Bros, since it was bottled).  The only other thing I liked about this place (you know, besides the cole slaw), was the chili. It was a tad spicy but it was very flavorful. So if you do decide to come to Primanti Brothers, your best bet is probably to just stick with a cup of chili and a side of cole slaw.",

Normally, I hit up the Southside location to get my primanti's fix, but I was in the strip and we wanted something filling and cheap, so we came here. I got the turkey sandwich with a fried egg and my boyfriend got the steak. We both adored them, as we always do. The amount of food you get for the amount of money you pay, is insane. The bread is so fresh and everything is ALWAYS tasty. Plus, the staff is friendly and that's always a bonus.  If you haven't always tried Primanti's, then you must. There really isn't another choice.",

Not sure what all the hype is about. Apparently credit cards are accepted now, and one can get double meat for $1.99. Recommend anyone who has a good appetite to get that option. It's basically a regular sized sandwich on soft white bread with french fries, cabbage with mayo & meat. The cabbage with mayo seemed to be the biggest layer. They have a parking lot for customers, but depending on how many people are dining there, maybe small.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I visited Pittsburgh this past week for a quick 2 day trip. When we arrived, we wanted to get something close to our Airbnb and after driving from Buffalo for 4 hours and visiting The Night of The Living Dead cemetery, we were definitely ready for lunch.   I ordered a bacon and cheese sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the assorted cheese sandwich. The sandwiches are quite large and arrive to your table on a wrap instead of a plate. What Primanti's is most-known for is the Cole slaw and fries that are also on the sandwiches instead of on the side.   Unfortunately, I thought my sandwich really lacked flavor and it basically tasted like I was eating French fries slapped between white bread. It was very dry. The coleslaw was an oil based slaw, whereas I think a mustard or mayo based slaw would have helped with the dryness. I think my boyfriend enjoyed his sandwich and said he'd return again but he's also a vegetarian and loves carbs more than anyone.   This was my third trip to Pittsburgh and I've had multiple people freak out that I never stopped at Primanti Bros. so that's the main reason why I came here - to say that I did. It didn't do much for me but at least I finally tried it. This is apparently a Pittsburgh staple so if you're visiting the area you might want to check it out. But if you're not really a sandwich person or come from a food-city (like Buffalo NY) then this place can definitely be skipped.",

    "text": "Love love love this place. It's open 24 hours and on New Years. This was my first time in Pittsburgh and everyone told me to go here. This is what Pitt is known for. Typically when people tell me I have to try a staple of a certain city, I am left disappointed because it's overhyped, the wait is typically forever, and the food is not THAT good. However Primanti Bros was not overhyped for nothing.   I walk in and there's open seating everywhere. It was crowded but not overly crowded. I hate when there's a wait and I see a bunch of open tables. primantis self seating was perfect. The waitress came over right away and got us our drinks. Idk if this time was just not as busy because it's New Year's Day and I was there during the steelers game (they were playing the browns... there's not a worse team in the NFL).   We ordered. I got 3 sandwiches (Cajun chicken, pastrami, and the pittsburger), and the smallman chilli cheese fries. The fries came out immediately. It was faster than jimmy johns and it was hot and fresh and delicious. The 3 sandwiches came out in less than 5 min after. The service was impeccably quick!   The smallman chilli cheese fries were topped with chilli, sour cream and bacon. It could honestly use a bit more bacon but they were delicious. The sandwiches all come with Cole slaw and fries stuffed in them. The Cole slaw was perfect, it was not overly flavored so it did not take away from the taste of the meats. The French fries were crispy so it added a bit of a crunch to the sandwich. All the meats were perfectly cooked to the right tenderness. They were evenly cut on halves and served to us on plastic wrap and not a plate. I prefer this because it's more economical.   For $7, these sandwiches are ridiculously filling, I couldn't even finish each half out of the 3 sandwiches that I ordered.  Highly recommend coming here. If I'm ever back in Pittsburgh, this will definitely be my first stop again!",

    "text": "As other outsiders have said, this must be a Picksburgh thing because they are wildly successful and have multiple locations throughout the city.  This was our first and definitely last visit with these Bros.  We came in for a late lunch.  It was somewhat busy, but not that busy, and yet chaos ensued as the hostess seated some people, ignored others (like us), then seated some more out of order, and oh, you twos just standing there need a table too (um, no, we just like to walk into places and stare at others as they eat).  Eventually we are directed to a dirty table and wonder if we are supposed to order at a counter or a server comes to the table.  In hindsight, I am glad that it was dirty because I saw a bucket of dirty water on a bar stool where the hostess would repeatedly dip an old towel into and wipe down tables.   The menu is primarily sandwiches, fries, soup and chili.  The big deal is that they put fries and slaw on top of your sandwich, and it looks like a monster sized sandwich.  As we continue wondering about the ordering process, a very bored looking young man comes over and takes our order.  I chose the Ragin Cajun chicken sandwich, and my husband chose the Pastrami and a side of fries.    The first items to arrive at the table are the diet cokes.  The menu does not offer a range of sizes, so we figure, it's a standard size or a large.  Wrong.  It's a child's size drink except there is no lid.  I guess spills not a worry here because that bucket of dirty water is ready to go.  And also no straw, but I spyed some on the bar so I helped myself.  Next the fries came out.  They looked like fresh cut fries, and we munched on those as we waited, and waited, and waited, and waited some more for our sandwiches to come out.  My husband said fries were soggy, and I said they are fresh like Inn N Out.  I was wrong.  Please forgive me Inn N Out, I was just delirious with hunger, they are nothing like yours!  Sandwiches kept whizzing past us, and no kidding, everyone around us had theirs, even people who ordered after us.  I think bored young man went home or found something less boring to do than wait on us.  Finally, sandwiches come out, and they do this weird thing where they barely cover them in paper and just plop them down on the table, no plate of any kind.  My sandwich looks pretty good, but taste wise, there's nothin Ragin about that Cajun.  Fries in sandwich and those we ordered on the side, extremely lacking salt, and as my husband said, soggy.  Slaw on sandwich is just cabbage in vinegar which is fine with me because it's healthier, but again it lacked seasoning.  I ended up pulling chicken out of sandwich and just eating that alone.  My husband, extremely dissatisfied and not understanding why I chose this place.  Like I said, it's a Picksburgh thing!",

    "text": "On my way back from dropping my Daughter off in Ann Arbor, I decided to make my solo return home s bit of a foodie side trip.  I diverted from my planned return route to experience the Primanti Bros. sandwiches.  Thanks to GPS I was able to find this fabled restaurant in Pittsburgh's Strip District.  After parking my car for $6 I headed towards Primanti Bros.  There was a long line but thankfully two large parties ahead of me.  Since I was solo I got in quickly and was seated at the bar.  TV's everywhere showing college football.  Very lively bar scene.  I perished the menu and decided on the pastrami sandwich which comes with tomato, coleslaw, and French fries.  I was so excited to be there that I mistakenly ordered more fries.  The sandwich served on white bread arrived after the fries which were outstanding.  I bit into the sandwich and I was in love.  I normally hate coleslaw as it is creamy but this vinegary slaw was the perfect complement to the pastrami and fries.  Every bite was wonderful.  The layers of flavor in this sandwich were singing to me.  I wish I could have brought them home.  I devoured it and then settled up to Make room for more patrons.  Picked up a T-shirt on the way out.  So if you are in Pittsburgh this is a must visit.  Well worth the detour!",

It  was packed, but another couple had 2 empty seats and offered them to us. The employees bust their butts here, and we got waited on and served right away. I had roast beef and RJ had angus steak. RJ told me there would be French fries and slaw on my sandwich, but I had no idea how good that would be. And I expected a roll or toasted bread. It's served on slices of fresh Italian bread and I just loved the way the cold, fluffy bread absorbed all the flavor from the hot roast beef and fries and cold cole slaw. We also ordered cheese fries because the fries are so good. My only regret is that I didn't ask for cheese on my sandwich, I'll know for next time. But a weird thing. The girl who offered us a seat walked out. Her man friend said to us, I should settle up so you don't get stuck with our bill. Then he disappeared, and we never saw him pay which was right  in front of where we were sitting. We made sure their bill wasn't on our check, which it wasn't. $18 for all of that, and I took half of mine home for the next day and it was still delicious!!",

    "text": "From what I'm told, if you come to Pittsburgh, you have to come here for a sandwich, so I did, not once but twice. First at the Market Square (MS) location and then one more time late night at the original Strip District (SD) location, two completely different atmospheres.  The SD is more of a traditional grill while the MS is more cosmopolitan with a patio and great sightseeing. I like the place. The sandwiches are good. I had the corned beef/pastrami version the first time and really liked it. I went with the burger version next and it was good too. I'm curious though, how a place with so many accolades doesn't seem to make its own food. The bread is locally-made and delish, but Primanti Brothers doesn't make it. It also doesn't appear that they make their own hamburger patties, but I can't confirm. Not sure they make their own slaw.  Their schtick is that they pile high a handful of slaw and french fries on all sandwiches. While tasty, nothing is special. The fries aren't particularly unique or outstandingly good. Seems to me, if they go on every everything and the restaurant is known for it, shouldn't the fries be among the best in the city?! Nonetheless, it's a good, huge sandwich and plenty filling. When I'm back in PA, I'll likely try it again. By the way, the SD location is open 24x7.  I even went a 3rd time but only for drinks. No complaints with the service at all. Service was outstanding at both venues.",

Overall, it is a decent casual spot to grab a bite, but that's about it.",

    "text": "Ok ok ok ok .... I cannot speak for some of the crazies here who are doggin this place with less than stellar reviews but I think they maybe had a bad day. Maybe they drank too much the night before (or not enough) and had a little crabby in their pants. Or as I learned from some bar friends I met when in Pizburgh - maybe they're just \"Jagoffs\"? Did I get that right?  Let me tell you the real deal about this place. Meat... GOOODD, Coleslaw...GOOODD, a cracked egg and a pile of hand cut fries ON the sandwich (F%^k yeah, why not!) GOOOOD, thick cut sliced Italian bread to hold it all together GOODD, and all that for under $10?! WHYAT!?!?!?!  Let's break this down first. Primanti Bros is indeed a spot made famous by truck drivers and steel workers who needed a filling sammy that they put all the things in and take it to go. Correct. Hence why they put fries on it for you.  Next, the classic (and only way) to get a Primanti Bros sandwich is meat (or double meat - I went with Pastrami and Cappicola), coleslaw, and french fries on it....and if you're hardcore, you add a fried egg and give the middle finger to anyone who judges you.  I did all the things, the bread held it all together, the meat hot and a little bit singed on the edges from the flat top and the coleslaw, a vinegary variety, not too creamy but the perfect amount of acidity to cut through the meat and cheese fats..  Goddam I'm drooling right now....  Shoot even their coffee was decent.   I finished the sandwich with little resistance, in fact when the fella came round to ask what I thought I sheepishly said that I think I could have eaten another one. He said if I ate two more our bills would be free, I politely declined because I worried I might have a coronary - but next time.  There is no way you can have a bad experience here, the people, the venue, the food - all so authentically Pittsburgh and wonderful. I cannot wait to come back!  Eatcrest Out",

The fries are great. The coleslaw is great. Together with the meat and the Italian bread made for a very delicious, unique and satisfying sandwich. Service was good and the three of us ate for $36. I doubled the meat and shared the roast beef and cheese. The hubby got the pastrami. So many times there's a lot of hype and my expectations become too high. Then I'm disappointed. That was not the case with Primanti Brothers. I took only one star away because the ladies bathroom smelled a little funky. But as far as the food goes, yummy and worth all the praise.",

It may or may not be mind-blowing but let me help manage your expectations.  They sell sandwiches with fries and coleslaw it them. It sounds amazing and no doubt you'll finish your meal and will be satisfied. Albeit, don't be surprised if you're underwhelmed. It's a 24-hour greasy spoon so do you really expect a 5-star meal? I tried the Pitts-Burger & Cheese and Pastrami & Cheese, both good, but not so unique to make me want to go back anytime soon. If I'm ever back here, I imagine it's after bar hopping or after a Steelers game. When that does happen I plan to get a nice roast beef sandwich. Oh, and the coleslaw was actually pretty dang good.  If anything, come here for the Pittsburgh Steelers-pride atmosphere (lots of nice wall art), a bottle or two of Iron City Brewski, and a very filling sandwich.",

If you can't tell from the pic it's fries, coleslaw and whatever meat you choose between two pieces of bread, that's what this place is known for. I'm not exactly a huge fan of my fries and coleslaw all together, to be honest I would probably enjoy it all separate. But, this is a Pittsburgh thing so I always feel obligated to get a sandwich here. A nice plus is they are open all the time so if you are looking for a late night meal this is your spot.",

I love shopping, and this part of the city is home to a large number of international grocery stores, boutiques and souvenir shops. But besides the shopping, you come here to eat. And while there are a ton of great restaurants here, your first stop should be the original location of Primanti Brothers.  Even during the Great Depression Pittsburgh's Strip District was a bustling hub of activity, with trucks transporting goods in and out of the city at all times of day. And everyone was looking for a good, hearty cheap meal. And that's where their signature sandwich comes in. You can get it with beef or turkey or pork -- or all three! Just don't try to get it with fries on the side. The traditional way is to get the fries inside the sandwich. Load on the carbs!  The street is also home to some other good food -- though you likely won't be hungry after the massive sandwiches at Primanti Bros. I recommend sharing a sandwich then walking the strip and eating the many free samples nearby at Mancini's and the Pennsylvania Macaroni Co.",

They're famous for their all in one sandwiches, that is, meat, cheese, slaw, fries, etc, all between two slices of french bread.  I got a roast beef sandwich and when it came out it was huge.  It was not bad and filling, but I had two real complaints.  One, the french bread is so squishy- it really has no \"body\" and is pretty much smashed and tasteless by halfway into your sandwich.  Two, the flavor of the slaw really overpowers the sandwich.  Of course, generations of folks have eaten the sandwich so it's not going to change.  You should still stop by and enjoy this Pittsburgh icon but I'm a bit disappointed that this sandwich didn't blow me away like i hoped it would.",

So stop it.  Seriously...stop.  You know when Primanti's hits stride?  At one in the morning, when you're belligerently drunk, everything is closed, and you want something that is ok, and will put down a nice base to prevent tomorrow's hangover.  It's heavy, greasy, and full of starch, everything you want if you're trying to cope with the fact that you shouldn't have had that last shot of Jameson.  But to tell people that they need to come to this place, during regular business hours, and get a sandwich?  Shame on you Pittsburgh, how do you sleep at night?",

    "text": "This is the 3rd or 4th Primanti's location I have visited, the atmosphere at this original location is definitely the best.  I came here on Saturday with my family as they were in town from NY visiting, as well as my boyfriend and his mom.  My dad is the one who suggested that he wanted to try Primanti's after seeing/hearing about it from TV and Pittsburgh locals. As for me, even though it was my birthday and this isn't my favorite place, I was happy to take them to experience a Pittsburgh original.   It was very busy and the woman who was hostessing was very quick to tell us our large party must wait outside. Didn't ask a name, tell you how long.. just don't come in.  The guys took a little walk while some of us girls snuck in after we saw a few parties leave.  Once inside it only took about 10 minutes for us to be seated.  It seamed our waitress had the same attitude/mind set as our waitress - maybe it was because they were busy, but it wasn't as pushy at any of the other times I have tried Primanti's. I ordered the fish and cheese sandwich because I'm not a huge lunchmeat fan, nor have a found one of their sandwiches that I think is worth eating again. I want so much to like their meals because I love the concept w/ the fries and coleslaw. I am was happy with my decision to get fish - it went perfectly with the coleslaw and if I ever find myself back at another location, I will be happy to order it again.  Even though they are always too big for me to finish a full serving. My boyfriend tried a new one for him and got the Kielbasa, which he usually loves, so I am not surprised that he really enjoyed this.  Some of my family ordered the Pittsburger version and said they liked it. I have had this before and was less that impressed, it wasn't a nice juicy burger, instead it was a dry piece of ground cube steak. Our drinks and food arrived quickly, and they have a fast turn over so my one tip would be that if it seems like there is a wait, stick it out because it is likely it won't be long.",

    "text": "I freaking LOVED THIS PLACE!!!   I recently visited the Keystone state and decided after hearing about Primanti's on TV and from some friends, along with my love of sandwiches, I'd give them a try. Let's just say, four days in Pittsburgh, PA. resulted in four trips to Primanti's Bros....and I can't wait to go back!   My first venture to Primanti's (I went to the original on 18th Street, which opened in 1933) was at about 3:00am after having a drink or two. The original location is open 24 hours and has the ambiance of on old-fashioned sandwich shop, with that hard steel city type of vibe. I immediately liked it! Their sandwiches come with a mix of slaw, tomato, a touch of provolone cheese and french fries. I have always been leery about having fries in my sandwich but when in Rome, stick anything in your mouth. Being that it was my first trip I went with the Pitts-burger (#2 Best Seller) and a side of cheese fries. Voila! I had an instant mouth orgasm. I'm not a huge french fry guy but DAMN are their fresh cut fries a hit! Lightly salted and packing a ton of flavor. I mean I could not get enough of them and even stole most of the cheese fries from my better half. I was amazed by the flavors I was encountering as I ate my sandwich.  After the first trip I knew I had to go back but I kind of surprised myself when it was less than 12 hours later. When I went back I wanted to try my favorite sandwich, the pastrami. Come to find out that it's Toni's favorite sandwich too. Who's Toni you ask? She is the adorable, spitfire, beautiful, dream of human being who has been a part of Primanti's for decades. She was easily one of my favorite parts about the experiences at Primanti's, along with all of the staff who really care and appreciate you coming into their establishment. Something we don't see enough of these days! Back to my and Toni's favorite, the pastrami sandwich. Holy schnikes! I almost pooped my pants it was so damn good. Excuse my terminology but this was a religious food experience for me. As I ate the pastrami I began to truly appreciate the combination of meat, to slaw, to fries ratio. I mean they aren't the most complicated combinations in the world but damn do those people at Primanti's make the combo work. You even get to taste the acidity of the tomato, followed up with a hint of cheese but the slaw and fries do all the work.   Day three...trip three, by know I am in love with Primanti's slaw as well as Toni as I run into her again. Pastrami is the choice of the day and I'm totally assured that the slaw is simply insane. Simple in it's mixture of slaw, vinegar, some salt and pepper, oil and sugar. It's just insane to me how it tastes so good. Sticking with the pastrami sandwich I began playing around with the ingredient combos. First, I added extra slaw (on the sandwich and on the side) and then I started to bury my delicacy in hot sauce. Tons of it! I have found my Primanti's sandwich perfection!  Day four...trip four and it was time to say goodbye to my brief but fulfilling edible encounter with Primanti's. On the way to the airport I make my final trip to see my love, she is there, waiting for me with open arms, giving me what I need and desire... Crap! What am I writing here? It was another round with the pastrami, the slaw, hot sauce, fries, and so on to give my pallet what it needs. I know this review is way over the top but that was my experience at Primanti's Bros. WAY OVER THE TOP! I love this place; highly recommend it and dream of a day when they open a joint down here in Texas!",

    "text": "For those not familiar with Primanti Bros. (you obviously are not from Pittsburgh), their signature items are delicious, giant sandwiches featuring your choice of meat, provolone cheese, their delicious fries, Italian dressing based cole slaw, and tomato on two slices of Italian bread.  The sandwich was invented to serve the workers in the warehouses nearby during the early Twentieth Century.  By including the fries and slaw on the sandwich, it made it easier to serve them quickly.  They have other items on the menu, like soup and their \"Soon to be Famous Chicken Wings,\" but the sandwiches are definitely the featured attraction.  I had been to Primanti Brothers before, but this was my first visit to the original location in the Strip District.  As I expected, the original location was definitely a cut above the rest.  I went at 2 p.m. on a Saturday afternoon during football season.  When I arrived, I walked in and found an open seat at the bar.  The person who previously sat there had just left, so as I sat, the bartender (I didn't get her name.  But she was cute!) offered to clean the spot for me, and did.  She immediately asked me what I was drinking.  I ordered an I.C. (Iron City) Light, which she promptly went and got for me.  Then, right away, she asked me if I knew what I wanted to eat.  I told her I did, and she took my order.  I ordered my favorite, the Kielbasa and Cheese (see the photo I posted).  She put the order in right away, and, since the grill is actually behind the bar, right near where I was sitting, I saw the cook begin to prepare it.  It didn't take very long before the bartender brought me my sandwich, cut in half, and served on wax paper.  It also didn't take very long before I had completely consumed the sandwich, as the bartender observed after seeing it gone and the wax paper crumpled into a ball, \"Well!  It looks like you enjoyed that!\"  I confirmed that I did.  It was definitely better than the Kielbasa and Cheese that I had had at other Primanti Bros. locations before.  While I was eating my sandwich, I noticed the cook preparing the same for someone else, and I noticed her dropping the sausage into the fryer.  I don't know whether or not this is a common practice in restaurants, as all the restaurants where I worked didn't serve kielbasa.  But I thought it was interesting, and I think it gave the sausage a nice flavor, and rendered it both crispy and juicy.  I was definitely pleased.  The one negative about this place is that it is cash-only.  It's not really a big deal because there is an ATM inside.  I don't know how much the fee is to use it, but if you want to be safe, then just come prepared.  Finally, I have one more suggestion.  The Strip District has a nice market nearby, as well as a lot of street vendors selling fresh fruit, baked goods, souvenirs, and sports memorabilia from the local teams.  You may want to arrive early and spend some time browsing before dining, or check it out afterwards.  I love Primanti Brothers, and will definitely be checking out the original location in the Strip District the next time I get to return to this wonderful city!",

After we ate our sandwiches, he couldn't wait to bring us the receipt and get our money.   After all, I can say that you should go there once, because it is like a tourist feature. Though once is enough in my opinion.",

    "text": "This is an unpopular opinion, but oh well: I've lived in Pittsburgh my whole life and don't understand the hype behind Primanti Brothers. Their pizza is delicious, I will give them that, but the classic \"Pittsburgh personified\" sandwich with cole slaw and fries on it, while creative, is nothing to write home about. You could get something more flavorful by walking into the prepared foods section of any gas station along the way. I'm serious.   Any time I've had the misfortune of being taken to Primanti's, especially at this location (which is dirty and trashy), I choose not to eat. I'd actually prefer not to eat at all than to waste my money on a sandwich with bread that has the consistency of the dried-out kitchen sponge you've had on your counter for too long and fries that taste kind of like kindling. No flavor, no texture, nothing of value. The meat stuffed inside isn't too bad, but to eat a sandwich with just the meat in mind isn't the best use of your money either. The cole slaw is lackluster.   Yes, Primanti's has other items on its menu, but I have never seen anything there that made me want to jump for joy and get it into my stomach as fast as possible. The more 'restaurant-like' locations (such as the one in Harmar) offer a bigger menu with more palatable food. I've had nice big salads there. But the Strip Primanti Brothers is a greasy, nasty place. I'd rather eat the wax paper your sandwich is served on.  If you're visiting Pittsburgh as an out-of-towner, go to Primanti's if you want to go, \"Why is this place the talk of the town?,\" or for a good value, but not for quality food or for a meal actually worth your time.",

Service was a bit confusing to me, but the cook/server/hostess took our order about ten minutes in.  My pastrami was great, the BF's cheesesteak was just meh. Fries and coleslaw on the sammie was a nice little catch, and the interior was divy and dingy just like you'd want and expect.  It was super cheap for the amount of food we got though (yeah $15 dinner for two!).  I would want to try chili fries if we happen to go in again.",

We arrived and at 2am, the place was still packed - always a good sign. We found a place to sit and ordered. We asked if we could order seperately and the waiter said to just order all at once and we could figure it out later. I asked if I could have no Coleslaw (most coleslaw has vinegar in it which makes me sick) and was told that I would have to take it off the sandwich myself. I understand its a tradition, so I won't get too sour about this, but I wasnt super thrilled about this.  Our food finally came and the waiter was a jerk to my friend when she asked for extra forks. We asked what the totals were and he said we had to pay all together. We had previously asked about this and been told it was fine to do it seperately, but that wasn't an option now. Instead of taking all the time to figure out what we owed (there was no bill) I just paid so we could catch our cab home.  Now on to the food. Awesome. It was quite delicious. I understand why my friends took me there... I inhaled my sandwich and was ready for another one. Def worth the bad attitude wait staff.  All in all, the food was five stars but the service was not. Its not a sandwich you want to miss out on, but don't go when they are busy.",

    "text": "For my 50th review, I figured I'd tackle Primanti's, since it's a PGH classic.  I came here a couple of years ago for lunch around noon, after visiting the Heinz History Center.  Although there was a line, my dining partner and I were able to get seated fairly quickly at the counter.  I ordered the chicken sandwich, and it took awhile to come out, but when it did, it was quite filling, and not half bad.  The bread was soft and thick, the fries and coleslaw were fresh, and the meat was well-grilled.  Sure, the food here is on the blander side taste-wise, but this is to be expected, given that many yinzers don't like their food overly spicy or bursting with strong flavors.  If you come here, don't expect haute cuisine--just some filling and unique sandwiches.  During our visit, an old lady was selling pastries behind the counter, so I bought a lemon one, and it was delicious!  (This isn't part of Primanti's regular offerings, though--she may have been a friend of the owners.)  Service was gruff and perfunctory, and we waited awhile for our sandwiches.  The atmosphere, as others have noticed, is quite divey, but that's part of the appeal of this place.  People-watching opportunities abound.  This is a good place to take out-of-towners for a filling and unique lunch.  Take your guests to dinner at a place such as Cure or Legume, or perhaps an ethnic restaurant, to give them an idea of the range of PGH cuisine.  3.5 stars.",

I tried hard to like it, but just couldn't.  I ordered steak sandwich or whatever it was, and I found the proportions to be as such: 2/5 coleslaw 2/5 fries and 1/5 meat. All in between slices that just seemed to be glorified white bread that was far too soft to hold everything. I suppose adding extra meat would help, because I felt that the coleslaw just overpowered everything to the point where I couldn't even taste the meat. And the fries? They were starchy and soggy. It was just too too much and far too bland. The fries dumbed down the flavor of everything.  If you are a teenage boy, this is the sandwich for you. But when it comes to sandwiches, I'd rather not have a coleslaw and fries sandwich. If anything, order it with extra meat. Perhaps try the corned beef? Everyone says that's the good stuff. Otherwise, it wasn't worth my time trying to find parking to get to the various branches.",

This is the way steel mill and dock workers got them 100 years ago (or whatever) so they could finish during their short lunch breaks. And it is PERFECT! The corned beef is my favorite, but they're all good. The bread is Italian style, super light and flaky with crunchy crusts. Awesome. The cole slaw is vinegary, not the sweet mayonaise kind. Get a Coke or a beer and you are in heaven. I know I am--I was there a couple of weeks ago and it was as good as ever.  This is the best location, close to the original, if not in the same spot (the original was just a window). It's loud, crowded, and moves fast. The cranky woman who seats you is part of the deal. The counter guys are fast and really make sure you get what you want. The bathrooms are in the basement and kind of scary--don't go alone, ladies. This place is a national treasure.

Will definitely comeback next time I'm in Pitt, I'll just make sure I avoid that server. ;-)))",

I liked the wings for sure and our friends liked their orders as well. So it's a 2 because its messy but one of a kind.  Sometimes good, other times not so good.

We all at one point in our lives must make the trip to the Strip district, wait in a really long line, and have an amazing sandwich which is part of our heritage.  When it is something you have had all of your life, you can't disparage it by giving the restaurant less than 5 stars.    So why are some of the reviews 1 star and 2 stars?  I guess some foodies expect a Tom Colicchio quality sandwich for the whopping $4.95 they are forking over.  I think you can only expect so much in way of presentation at this price point and need to reflect on the heritage of this fine institution and the part it plays in Pittsburgh culture.",

We visited on the day that Corbett and Christie were in town, so there was a small group of protesters outside the door. That certainly made things interesting, and instead of the politicians coming in to see everyone, they were brought in from some side door, and we never got to see them. Oh, well. The food is what we were there for, anyway. And it's always good.",

Putting more stuff between bread shouldn't really qualify a \"famous sandwich\". The meat was questionable and the slaw just didn't make it past one bite.   *********** I thought, maybe my expectations got the better of me. So, I gave it another shot a year later. I ordered the fish sandwich. The fish was lost in the fried batter. :( Again, with the slaw. Geez. The fries in the sandwich was a creative touch, I can agree.

The city locations have better meat than the suburban locations(due to supply and demand). I was told this by an employee some years back, and discovered it to be True. Meats come from two different sources.The menu has expanded to pizza, wings, burgers, and much more  over the years. I still go for the Pastrami and Cheese or the Cajun Chicken sandwich. Although the Chili is very good and a bit spicy.",

I came on a Thursday for lunch and got a table right away.  There is a large variety of sandwiches you can order and they all come with fries and coleslaw on top.  The price is great for the size of the sandwich that you get.  I got the \"Joe, Dick, & Stanley\" and one of the meats (I believe it was the roast beef) was a strange texture.  Also, it was lacking sauce and was pretty dry considering how much filling is in the sandwich.  However, the staff was friendly.  I definitely recommend trying it at least once if you are a visitor to Pittsburgh!",

I got got the pastrami as recommended by the server and found it extremely underwhelming. I sort of went out of my way to try this place, so I guess my expectations were higher than needed to be.   The pastrami slices were shaved (I like my pastrami on the thicker side), the onions were in between uncooked and slightly sauteed (I kind of feel like you need to stay raw or go all the way carmelized with onions), the fries in the sandwich weren't crispy enough (if you're going to put fries in a sandwich, it should be for that fried crunchy texture) and lacked flavor (any seasoning), and the sauerkraut was also a bit bland. Sigh.  The server was extremely nice though and they have parking fo visitors so I bumped the rating up to 3 stars.",

A friend native to the city suggested I visit Primanti's so I ventured out to the Strip District location. Thankfully, I arrived right before the tourist/lunch rush. As a Cincinnati resident, I wasn't sure if I should love or hate the interior, specifically the scores of black & yellow. Pun intended. I know, I'm having a ball.   I ordered the pastrami sandwich with fried egg and liked it. It wasn't the best sandwich I've ever had, but I liked it. The most impressive part of my visit? Watching the cook remember all of the orders without writing anything down.",

The sandwich was huge and tasty.  I'm fussy about  cole slaw and it did not disappoint.   The menu tells you the history of how it started and you can hear the pride that the locals have with this place.  We got to see Toni who has been here for decades and was on the segment aired on The Travel Channel. You should definitely stop by and taste what the locals are crazy about!",

Sorry no pizza.) and is much more on the divey side but you still get that amazing sandwich and it is an experience to be where it all started.  If to have never had a Primanti sandwich, here is the run down: Pick a meat, it goes on thick bread piled high with vinegar based coleslaw, tomatoes and french fries creating one of the most unique sandwiches out there.   I know a lot of people say it is a gimmick and really isn't anything special but, forget those people. Try it yourself and make a decision based on your experience.  I've been eating them for years and they never get old to me. I like them and continue to throw money down for one every now and then.    I had the Hot Sausage and Cheese with a Fried Egg which goes against my normal Capicola and Cheese but I was feeling something different. It was pretty good but not enough to take over my #1 spot! Coupled with cheese fries and an Iron City Beer and it was a fantastic meal.",

It was clear that \"special orders\" weren't the norm, even toast and bacon, which ended up not agreeing with me.

Why not? Beer, salami and an egg...  The filling part of the sandwich was great but the bread was not up to par for me. Bread makes the sandwich. It can also kill a sandwich. Dry bread that was sort of Texas toasty. 4 stars for a cool atmosphere and great sandwich fillings and a beer menu. I will try again next time I'm in town.",

I've been hearing about this iconic Pittsburgh institution for years, and I was looking forward to checking it out for the first time.  So after waiting in line for 20 minutes or so, I was expecting something special.   It's really not.    Yes, the sandwich is \"tall\", but it's only because it's stuffed with fries and slaw, and the bread is thick sliced.  If anything, the amount of meat in the sandwich is disappointing.   The best thing is the bread.  But take the fries and slaw out (neither are good), and the whole thing is not even very filling.  The place is very busy at lunchtime and seemed disorganized and understaffed.  You'll never get a drink refill or even a check.  You're lucky if you get served in the first place - the paper-wrapped sandwich unceremoniously deposited at your table - and you'll never see the server again.    Nothing special.  Don't bother.",

    "text": "I can definitely see why this place was on the Pittsburgh must-eat list; it's more about the experience than the actual taste (not to say the taste is bad).   Husband and I visited for dinner and we decided to sit in the dining area side (on the left) rather than the bar area (on the right).  You pretty much seat yourself and grab a menu as you sit.  We ordered a Cajun chicken breast and Sirloin steak and cheese sandwich. All sandwiches have french fries, coleslaw and tomatoes inside and you can add onions if you want. We also ordered chili fries.  The food comes out SUPER fast. I think we waited 2-3 minutes into ordering to get our food.  What really surprised me is that they don't give you the food on plates. The sandwiches just came on parchment paper and the chili fries on a paper dish. They have paper towel rolls on each table instead of napkins too.   The size of these sandwiches are pretty big (because they're stuffed!).  The sandwiches were pretty good, but the chili fries were a bit wet. :( I think it would have been tasty as a chili, but it was on the watery side so the fries were really soggy.  Other than that, definitely enjoyed the experience!",

We felt like we should give it a try.   We did not have high expectations based on feedback we got from locals at our hotel and out Uber drivers. We were pleasantly surprised with our experience. My sons tried the corned beef sandwich and loved it. Noting this was their first experience with corned beef. We also ordered a roast beef sandwich. We divided two sandwiches between 3 hearty appetites. Our favorite all in was the corned beef sandwich.  Accept this place for what it is and that is a historic joint (1933).  Nothing fancy and nothing fine dining. However, the sandwiches were good and we would visit again.",

Toni. Well I got to do both!!!! I had the large flush sandwich and it was AMAZING!!! The bread was great, the slaw was good and the fish and fries were the best! Then I asked if Miss. Toni was available for a picture and she was. Toni came out took a few pictures then sat with Sara and I for about 20 minuets telling us all about Primanti Brothers, the different locations and about her time there. What a great day. This was a major bucket list thing. Thank you for the great food and the time Miss. To I got so spend with us!",

The bread itself... very fluffy and soft (enjoyable). I had roast beef and my boyfriend had the fish. The roast beef was just that... roast beef. Nothing to ooh and ahh about I guess. There french fries were not crispy or hot so it just added this lack luster to the sandwich with zero flavor added. If this is your most beloved sandwich shop-Pittsburg step your game up, REALLY.

I got the popular Pitts-burger and cheese sandwich and the Small St. Fries. Although the sandwich was delicious and the Smallman St fries were awesome, I'd say this place was a TAD overhyped for me. I think what knicked a star off was the combination of the coleslaw being too vinegar-y (my personal preference) and the fact that on average, the price was much higher than the other places I went to in Pittsburgh. It is a popular tourist destination spot so I guess I understand.  The guy at the bar who helped us out was really nice though so customer service was great and the vibe in the place was chill.  I do recommend this place to all and will visit again to try out the other sandwiches (having the coleslaw on the side)",

My husband and I eat here at least once a week. I always get the bacon and cheese with double bacon and he always gets a double bacon, egg and cheese. The sandwiches come on Italian bread with fresh cut fries and a vinegar based slaw on them unless you order otherwise. They're huge and Sooo good!",

Don't listen to these 'out-of-townies' saying it's just OK, they have a different palate; being from a different area. Western Pennsylvania cuisine is heavily influenced by Polish, German, and Pennsylvania Dutch; I can understand where it might not be the best for some. But for people like me who were raised on pierogies, haluski, and golumpki -- this place is amazing. Pair the #2 best seller with a Yuengling, and you won't be disappointed.",

They serve it with fries and coleslaw on it which was very interesting, but made for a tasty sandwich. Enjoyed that it was a real coleslaw and not covered in mayo. It was an experience, and we may go back on one of our next visits to try something else.",

We all were putting ketchup and hot sause on our cheese steak sandwhiches just to give them flavor.

We had seen Primanti Brothers on TV many times, on many shows, so we planned on eating there while in town.  A few days before we left on our trip, I decided I wasn't too excited about eating there since fries on a sandwich wasn't too appealing, and it looked a little dry.   We had decided the night before we left Pittsburgh we might as well give it a shot on our way out of town. Since we weren't sure we'd care for it, we ordered cheese fries and split a pastrami sandwich. I must say, we were pleasantly surprised. I scarfed mine down in about half the time she did. I was tempted to order one for the road.  The bread was moist, the coleslaw had a nice vinegar flavor, and I thought the pastrami was tasty. I will definitely eat there the next time I'm in town.  Note: The previous night we stopped in the South side location, but it was a fog of smoke. We didn't make it a few steps in before doing an about- face. The 18th Street location was smoke free, at least during lunch.",

If you've had one, you've had every sandwich they sell. They all taste the same, maybe if they salted the fries? Anyway I guess I outgrew the taste of these grease balls. A cold Sam Adams was sitting in front of me and suddenly I thought of it, I can eat healthy by getting turkey, no cheese, fries, or mayo. The waiter looked perplexed after asking him if I could just have turkey with onion, slaw, and tomato. Didn't matter, my sandwich came with fries anyway, guess you can't teach an old dog new tricks. I picked the fries off and gave them to my friend, who by the way does not take Zocor. As I stated before in a quick note, this original Primanti's is basically a tourist trap, Oakland college getaway, and food network geek paradise. I'll go to the primanti full service restaurant on the other side of Crafton where they cook a bit healthier and offer lighter fare.",

    "text": "The girlfriend, J, was in a Pittsburgh wedding. I agreed to go along for the sole purpose of going to Primanti Brothers for one of their sandwiches. I always thought that people made fun of major cities like Pittsburgh because their favorite sports team was beaten by the Steelers, Penguins or Pirates. By my fourth say in Pittsburgh I realized sports had nothing to do with the mockery. Pittsburgh will always hold the record for the highest concentration of people asking me, \"Holy sh*t! You're from LA? Ever see any movie stars?\"   So yeah, by the 4th day Primanti Brothers had a huge burden on its proverbial shoulders in order to change my opinion of Iron City. We arrived at the original location about noon on a spring Sunday. When we walked in there were a lot of empty tables with food on them. J and I weren't sure where to go or what to do so we just stood there by the door with that newbie stare. A waitress finally talked to us realizing we needed some guidance. I believe her gravely smokers voice told us to \"sit anywhere.\" As we walked to the least offensive looking table I noticed that J and I were the only people not wearing a Troy Polamalu Steelers jersey. Being a lifelong Trojan fan I had to laugh because even though I was from out of town I had been a Polamalu fan at least four years longer than even the most die hard fan in this place. BTW, the second most popular question I was asked that weekend was, \"You're a USC fan? Did you know Troy Polamalu went to USC?\"   The sandwiches were good but I definitely had my expectations set way too high. If I had been out drinking and just wanted to bury my face in a messy sandwich that allowed me to taste everything in one bite, including what most people consider sides, then Primanti Brothers would be the answer. If you have ever heard Patton Oswalt's routine on the KFC Famous Bowl you can relates to the Primanti Brothers sandwich experience.   But here's the proof in the pudding; would I come back? Abso-freakin-lutely! This place is good as long as you know what you are getting yourself into. It's fun to be messy sometimes and for a guy like me, all I have to do is mention Polamalu or Lynn Swann and I know I'll be welcome.",

It's a working-class Pittsburgh joint at heart, so if you want your rump kissed and a quick seating at a plush table, skip it... but if you like FOOD, this place is for you. Cash only! An outstanding selection of delectable meats, cole slaw that's a uniquely savory vinegary glory of goodness, and fries right on the bread. Eat it together, and relish in the complexity of the taste. It's a phenomenal selection. I'm a pastrami man as a rule when I go here, but I've had terrific experiences with the angus, roast beef, corned beef (outstanding) capicola (particularly excellent), and kolbassi (very, very good) as well. The pastrami is exceptional in my opinion. And yeah, I've been here that many times. It's a MUST-GO in the 'burgh. Notes: Treat your server like gold. Watch how hard she's working! NEVER say no to the baklava; it's the best I've ever had. ($1 on a tray from grandma. Perfect!) When it's cold out, keep the door closed or prepare to be yelled at. No, you can't seat yourself, so stop asking. And for the love of god, YES it's worth the wait! Get in line!",

Three friends and myself walked into the place at 330am, weary from the road and hungry as ever. We picked our own seat and within a few minutes our drink order was taken and delivered. Our Sandwich order was taken just then and within another 10 mins we were scarfing down these oh so good sandwiches.   The bread: soft, thick and held the whole thing together nicely.  The slaw: crunch, fresh, flavorful.  The fries: not oily at all, very tasty and plentiful.  The black angus: cooked to perfection, not rubbery.  The hot sausage: sausage was good, but not better than my NYC italian sauage sandwiches.   All said, it was a good experience, I'm glad I made the trip, the sandwiches satisfied our hunger and I got to visit Pittsburgh where Heinz ketchup was born. I won't be making a 6 hour drive just for these anytime in the future, but if I am near there I will definitely stop in again.",

I went here 3 times over a 4 day trip to Pittsburgh. My first night there at around 1am I showed up. Of course it is a legendary establishment and the corned beef is a well-known sandwich there.  So I already mapped out this would be my first stop in Pittsburgh. I arrive, greeted by friendly, but not fake over the top friendly, more of a \"hey how you doing\" staff of 2 employees. They are no-nonsense, they aren't there to wear \"flare\" and serve every dish with a smile. Order your awesome sandwich and keep it moving. So I sit at the bar, get my corned beef sandwhich with \"everything\", and take a bite. I think to myself, this is everything I thought it would be. The entire time the employees checked in \"You good? Need anything?\". I saw lots of comments from people saying they are rude. No, they wont say \"sir, may I kindly get you a beverage for your meal?\". But they will ask \"can I get you a drink?\". Awesome staff.  Had a pastrami and bacon sandwich the 2nd and 3rd visit. I ate several places in Pittsburgh but this was by far the highlight. Just go here if you're in Pittsburgh, its that simple. Open 24/7 and cash only.",

We usually visit the South Hills location which is close to our friend's house but on this beautiful spring Saturday, we thought it would be fun to go downtown and hit the Strip District.    This is the original location so it's a bit more touristy than the others.  The menu is more limited, no pizza or anything like that, and they only accept CASH so be prepared for that.  For me, there seems to be a general urgency to turn the tables as fast as possible, something I don't see in the other locations.  If you're looking to hang out for a while this probably isn't your stop.  It's kind of ironic that this original location with it's history of developing the all-in-1 sandwich for the local workers now serves more tourists and weekend visitors to the Strip District than anything else.  So, all that said, why 5 stars.  Well, for several reasons.  1. It's Primanti's so the sandwiches are simply amazing, I can't come to Pittsburgh without one, they're that good. The meat, the bread, the slaw, it's all good.  2. The history of the location trumps the transition.  You can meet Toni, the worker that's been there forever and is featured on Man vs. Food.  And it's in such a cool spot, in the Strip District. 3. It's part of the Pittsburgh experience, at least it is for us.  Prices run about $10 per person for a sandwich and a drink, not a bad deal for the massive sandwich.  And don't even think about splitting one, trust me, you can eat the whole thing!",

I would recommend  this place as a one time visit only. It's kitschy and fun, but it's not great. You get a super soggy sandwich and rude, rushed service.  I had roast beef and cheese with tomato, Cole slaw and fries. Like I said, good to try,  but that's about it. Your check comes wrapped in your sandwich paper, and it's pretty much dropped on your table. Then you're forgotten.  Want a refill on your drink or a box? Too bad!  Prices are good and this location  seemed cleaning. But it's  a tourist trap. They make so much money, they don't have to worry about being nice to customers.",

Regardless of the location, you cannot go wrong with any of the iconic Primanti Bros sandwiches. It's a Pittsburgh institution and if you are visiting, do yourself a favor and get to the nearest spot and order yourself up a sandwich. I recommend the cappicola, the bologna or the new HBK (Ham, Bacon, Kielbasa) named after the Penguins players.",

I am all about new experiences, especially when it comes to food.  So, when I made my first trip to Pittsburgh, I knew I must try Primanti Brothers. It was so packed during my one-night, two-day stay that I wasn't able to snag a sandwich. However, I was back just a few months later and made it! We tried going on a Thursday night, and it was packed, so we opted to come back on Friday around 1 p.m., hopefully beating the lunch rush.   Would definitely recommend trying this location at an off-time. Loved the decor and atmosphere. I love the area as well. I opted for the sweet sausage sandwich and it was tasty. Who doesn't love a sandwich with french fries on it? My only complaint about the meal is that the bread was a little soggy. Not sure if it was because of the sausage or if that's just what happens with their bread -- but that was a bit of a turn-off for me.   I would definitely recommend it (at least once!) for anyone visiting Pittsburgh. I'll be back at least once more to give it another go!",

The coleslaw on my sandwich was over powering and took away from the taste of the sandwich. The fries and meat patty were subpar.

The food is ok, but nothing special.  The sandwiches are ok, but to be honest, I like the Pittsburgh turkey sandwich they serve at Eat n Park with fries and cole slaw on it better than the ones at Primanti's.  I think it's because the fries aren't that great.  I think the atmosphere is definitely better than the food.  The place is definitely \"Pittsburgh\", which is a good thing if you're from here.  If you're not, you might be disappointed by the lackluster food.  I'm not sure what people from other cities think when they come here.  My wife is from a few hours away, and when she moved here, I took her there.  Well, she got the chicken tenders, and not a sandwich.  I said she had to try a sandwich just for the experience, but she thought putting fries and cole slaw on a sandwich was weird and didn't want it.  I'd consider this place more of a bar where you can watch sports rather than a place to come and get a good meal.",

Hearing that all of their sandwiches come with french fries and cole slaw, I was sold.  The inside is dated, but fun with wood paneling on the walls. When you get in and sit at a table, there's a menu on the wall. The gist is that you pick the meat that goes on the sandwich and they all come with french fries, coleslaw and onions. There were some interesting choices on the board, so I thought I'd play it safe and get bacon.  WHAT A GREAT IDEA! The slaw was great, not too much mayo. The french were crispy yet soft on the inside, and the bacon was crispy as well. My sandwich was in the $6 range and it filled me up!  Will have to come back and try a different meat variety.

The only difference is... the \"must-eats\" of named cities are actually top-notch, and Primanti's Bros. is just... okay.  The whole experience was underwhelming. I came to the original Strip District location expecting the best, and ordered a Corned Beef & Cheese. This place is over-hyped because:  1) The sandwiches are not as big as you've imagined. They are high because of the volume of the bread and fries. In reality, there isn't much meat. We ordered 1 sandwich to share between the two of us expecting a lot of food... but I could have easily finished it by myself.  2) The meat and fries are bland. All you taste when you bite into it is the acidity of the vinegar-based slaw. I'll admit that the slaw is delicious, but that should not be the highlight!  3) Service is friendly. I expected rough around the edges, blue-collared, no-nonsense attitudes, but I forgot this isn't New York.  Overall, happy to check it off my list, but probably don't need to come back to Primanti Bros, or Pittsburgh in general, ever again.",

Usually I don't like white bread but it really worked here, and they gave me a side of perfect cheese sauce to dip into.

We went back again in July of this year  on this trip to Pittsburgh and Cleveland and decided to visit it again since we have no recollection of what the hype on the sandwiches from the first visit.  The restaurant was not busy but it took a very long time to get a server and the server was not really  friendly toward us.  He took our orders and came back later with the bill when he saw that we were finished.   I ordered the New Yorker. My husband ordered the Pitts-burger. My son ordered the Joe,Dick and Stanley.   My sandwich was soggy with cold fries with not much meat. I tried a little of the Pitts-burger and the hamburger was bland.  My husband thought the Pitts-burger didn't have much taste either so it needed the hot sauce. This might explain why there was a bottle of hot sauce on the table to use. My son said his sandwich was very good but he is a child who always have positive things to say about everything. The sandwich was not memorable the first time and not memorable in a positive way for  taste or service this time. The bathroom was downstairs so you had to walk down the steps to a basement with concrete walls which felt kind of creepy if you are  alone. This is definitely a unique  touristy stop  but it really is over hyped. At least there was free parking!",

Primanti Brothers is an institutional staple in the Pittsburgh area.  The restaurant is famous for their sandwiches that are smothered with French fries and coleslaw.  Originally created as a whole meal-in-one for the truck drivers making early morning deliveries to the Strip, Primanti's sandwiches have since become a local go-to for tourists and has been featured on several Travel Channel and Food Network programs.   Let me impart a little local knowledge here.  The sandwiches suck.  My parents have always hated Primanti's and I've had a hit or miss experience over the years, so I had to convince her that we needed to give it one more shot.  We stood in line to get in (which pissed my mom off to no end) and when we finally sat down, the sticky table didn't leave the best first impression.    Our waiter arrived and we ordered two capicola and cheese's.  Although the prodigal sandwich was, as usual, dry and salty, it also had overwhelming flavor undertones of 'waste of money', and 'overrated'.    I've had friends visit who felt it some sort of rite of passage to indulge in salty mediocrity, and I can see how people outside of Pittsburgh would find French fries and coleslaw on a sandwich a KA-RAAAZZZY premise, but Primanti's isn't anything special and in no way worth bypassing the plethora of amazing restaurants the city has to offer.

    "text": "Alright, I have dreaded writing this review ever since returning from our trip because i loved Pittsburgh and the amazing people who live there that we were able to make friends with. I don't want to show any disrespect, so lets get that out of the way. My buddies and I went into this experience blind. We were later told by locals that we needed to visit Primanti Bros. after several drinks and not sober, but unfortunately our experience was sober. With that said here we go.....  The service was not that great. Folks seemed grumpy. I was shocked because the folks we met in Pittsburgh were some of the friendliest i have met in all my travels across the United States.  Capicola and Cheese- First off the coleslaw is more of a kraut then coleslaw. The capicola tasted like bologna and didn't resemble any capicola i've ever eaten. The french fries were soggy.  Roast Beef and Cheese- I didn't try it, but my buddy said it was the worst variation of a roast beef he's ever tried.  Pitts-Burgher Cheese Steak- This one is on us, but to put cheesesteak on anything for outsiders of Penn. people are thinking thinly sliced delicious rib-eye... not ground beef. Nonetheless it was the worst of all of the sandwiches.  Like i said we tried this place sober and everyone who we told our story to said that we should have drank first. I would like to give it a second chance, but my first impressions are sadly not very good.",

I do love the exterior of this location, and it looked especially cool with the icicles hanging from the roof (see picture!). I love that you know what you're getting when you walk in. Real, down to earth place with no pretensions. Waitress was super friendly and ... real. What you see is what you get with this place.   It does differ from the Market Square location a bit - no credit cards & no tap beer. Both things are only slightly annoying though, not enough to make me stop coming!   Tried a new sandwich this time - the \"Ragin' Cajun' Chicken\" with everything. Pretty darn good, but it wasn't too-too spicy.  When in the 'Burgh, it's a must visit!",

We shared a pastrami and a sirloin steak sandwiches. So tasty and filling!  We paid our modest sized bill and left, probably 20 minutes for the whole visit.

We decide to eat lunch there while exploring the Strip District instead of eating at the stadium location. When we first walked by, the line was wrapped around the building. We decided to explore some more and the second time we swung by, it looked a little less busy so we decided to give it a shot. We maybe waited 5 minutes for a table which wasn't a big deal at all. We ended up sitting at the bar and were immediately offered drinks and menus.   As for lunch, we ordered some fries to split which we were served right away and they were really good. I had to quit eating them because I was afraid I wouldn't want my sandwich.  I ordered the turkey breast and cheese and my boyfriend ordered the Pittsburger cheese steak. If you've never been, each sandwich is topped with fries, coleslaw, and tomatoes. We both ate our first half of our sandwiches and then decided to try each others. We both liked each others sandwich better than our own. Doesn't it always happen that way! Everything that is on the sandwich sounds delicious and you have to wonder why we weren't jumping for joy but we both felt like the fries on top dried it out some and I know I could have used some more sauce or mayo or something on it.  I'm sure I would eat there again if given the chance and perhaps try a different sandwich. The service and the atmosphere were both great so I can see us returning for a second shot.",

Fried zucchini was good, but I had better at the Micro Diner in Mount Washington the day before.  The sandwiches they are known for are just weird.  I got the Pitts-burgher sandwich, apparently the #2 best seller on the menu (Server said #1 was IC Beer).  The meat patty that was in that sandwich was a Salisbury steak patty.  I am not joking.  That gray, rubbery, dense, unmistakable taste took me right back to 6th grade school lunch and ruined anything that may have been good about the sandwich.  Game over from the first bite.  It was awful.  For god's sake, use a real beef patty.  Also tried a pastrami and cheese sandwich.  First off, the sandwiches are huge, and with all the toppings, very difficult to get a bite of everything at once.  When you do, the fries and coleslaw really overpower everything else (except  Salisbury steak). The pastrami was extremely tender, too tender, almost to the point of mushy, and it was very very bland.  It got completely lost.  The texture of the meat and the bottom piece of bread were one in the same, almost pasty.       The decor was what you would expect and the service was very good, but the food was just disappointing.  I think you have to try it to say that you have, but it's not worth another try.",

I only regret not getting some of that crazy-good bread and coleslaw to go.  For those unfamiliar, the coleslaw they put on every sandwich is NOT made with mayo. It's the Italian way with oil/vinegar/sugar and it's freaking delicious. Like, I ate every little, tiny stringy piece of it. And french fries on my sandwich? Like really? UHmazing.  It's really not as grease-pit as some might think. Yeah, triple grilled cheese. Yeah, french fries on my sandwich. But they put fewer fries on your sandwich than you'd normally eat if you ordered them on the side. So don't get all \"fattening, blah blah blah\" on me and turn up your nose to this joint.  It's amazing and I love it and I want them to expand to Chicago. Tomorrow.",

It is horrifying that Primanti Bros is some of the burghs best known food, and what most out of towners associate with our cities culinary stylings.  Don't get me wrong, we love our potatoes, fried, baked, hashed, mashed, or in pierogies, but Primanti Bros is the worst example of Pittsburgh staples.  The people watching is entertaining (especially when the bars let out at 2AM) and the Pittsburgh focused murals painted on the wall are fun. Primanti Bros signature sandwich has fries and coleslaw on it.  I'm all for fries and coleslaw on a sandwich.  In fact, take any side dish you want and throw it on a sandwich, but the combination will only be as good as the ingredients you start out with.    Primanti Bros fries and coleslaw are soggy, bland, and lack any flavor, crispy crunch, or lightness.  Their sandwiches are heavy, boring, and put me to sleep, and are the lowest form of Pittsburgh fare.",

    "text": "Starving because I hadn't eaten lunch and being in downtown Pittsburgh, Primanti Brothers was suggested.  I had tried a Pittsburgh salad before (a tasty combination of steak, french fries and riveria dressing) but had only heard about the bizarre sandwich that combined coleslaw, fries and whatever meat you chose.    We went to the original location in the Strip District. Since it was after 5:00, most of the shops and vendors in that area were closed, but I made note of the fact that I would need to return to this eclectic community filled with food vendors (including many ethnic varieties), Pittsburgh sports memorabilia, arts and culture venues and speciality boutiques to name just a few.    The menu at Primanti Brothers was simple but I still had a hard time deciding which sandwich to try.  I was assured by our friendly server that regardless of what I chose I would not be disappointed so I quickly surveyed the menu and chose turkey breast and cheese.  The server told the story about how the original sandwich was constructed so workers could combine their favorite ingredients into one easy to handle lunch package.  It was enjoyable to know a little more about the history of the sandwich I was about to try.    When our sandwiches arrived, I was amazed at the size.  Even though I was hungry, I doubted I could finish.  I took my first bite and knew I'd be back to this restaurant.  Not only was the sandwich tasty, but somehow the fries maintained some crispness and the bread didn't get soggy!  I ate the whole sandwich (probably quicker than I should have) and had plenty of praise to pass on to our server.  I can't wait to go back and try other varieties!",

I got a pastrami with a pickle on the side and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was piled high with fries and coleslaw. It was surprisingly well assembled so things never got too out of control.

I'm assuming the \"experience\" is waiting in a long line full of yinzer sports fanatics before/during/after a game. Luckily, when we went it was quite empty because I would have been extremely pissed if I waited more than 10 minutes for this awful sandwich.   I'm not saying it's awful because it's greasy and unhealthy, I LOVE greasy and unhealthy. This was just bland and overrated. It really blows my mind that this is the sandwich shop that has grown to represent Pittsburgh! I ordered the Pittsburgher Cheese steak (the #2 bestseller according to the menu). Coming from Philadelphia, I have high standards for cheese steaks. I thought, \"Hmmm...a cheese steak with fries, coleslaw and an egg...what could go wrong?\"  EVERYTHING.   The sandwiches are served on the softest bread that immediately soaks everything up and squishes paper-thin. I guess that's necessary because it's the only way you attempt to fit the giant disappointment in your mouth. The egg was flattened and dried out. The worst part of it was the meat. I became a little skeptical when i saw the cook carry out a box of frozen meat patties which made me reminiscent of time working at McDonald's in high school. The \"cheese steak\" consists of a beef patty that wouldn't even make a satisfactory burger. It was completely flavorless.  The best parts of the sandwich were the coleslaw and fresh cut fries, which I would have preferred to have on their own. I've hears the pastrami and cheese is pretty good, so if I'm ever pressured to try it again, I'd go with that. Otherwise, I'll get an overpriced sandwich somewhere else that won't be such a disappointment.",

I'm not a fan of the limited beer selection either. I will say I'm not a native Pittsburgher so maybe this is more acquired but there are much better places to take out of town visitors to eat that unless they begged, Primanti's would never even appear on my radar.

They don't seem to like you using the bathroom (it's in a nightspot, go figure). The great thing is that they are genuinely 24 hours and will make you anything at any time of day.  I have to admit the food is a bit more bland than other local Pittsburghese specialties along similar lines (like Peppi's). Having said that, I would recommend that everyone and their mother try eating there at least once, for three reasons. (1) It's the most famous eatery in Pitt. (2) A lot of people swear by it, so you might love it even though I don't. And (3) there is absolutely nothing in the world I have ever tried, that is similar to Primanti's sandwiches. They are, for lack of a better phrase, an entity unto themselves.  Another sticking point I have is the price. It's just too high for what it is and how busy they are. But then again, you do get a whole ton of food.  The only thing weirder than Primanti Bros, is that there is a Primanti Bros outside Pittsburgh. There are actually several, and they're all... yes, you guessed it. In Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I know, I know, that sounds weird. But look at it this way. If you had to pick ten large cities in America that did not have their own \"local\" flavour of food, Ft. Laud might be one of them, right? And if you had to guess where all the hot Italians in Pittsburgh go when they want to lay on a beach and get warm, you might guess Ft. Laud right? Well, perhaps that explains it then. Except that Primanti Bros is now not only the famous late night eatery in Pittsburgh.... it is also the most famous in Ft. Laud!  Plus the Ft Laud version has better scenery in all sorts of ways. To be honest Pittsburgh girls are probably as gorgeous as South Florida girls (probably the same girls on vacation?), but the difference is they're wearing different outfits because the weather is different... you might say. And the Ft Laud location is literally across from the beach. The very same beach that, on my first ever visit to Ft. Laud, I had an intimate encounter on, with a lovely girl. I got a ticket from the police during that encounter, but not for making love... for leaving the car parked illegally at 3am while going down onto the beach to do aforementioned activity. Sorry, was that too much information?  However, whereas in Pittsburgh I'd say, give it a try (the sandwich, not the sex, although that could be fun too)... if you're in Ft. Laud, do yourself a favour... drive to Miami, and try what is undeniably the best Cuban food in the United States... See my top lists for more on that.  PS I don't think Primanti's Permeate's my fave sandwiches list. For that reason I'm renaming it Permeate's. And if you come in here when all the Pitt frat boys are drunk, then it's more like P*nis's. Or perhas Pre-Pubescent's. In terms of levels of maturity anyway.  Still, it's better than The O - Original Hot Dog Shop. Don't read my review for that place. Trust me.",

    "text": "While visiting a friend in the area, he wanted me to take to the local Pittsburg institution of hangout places... it seems this place is very popular with the locals, especially the college students.  This location is their original store, thus it has lot of history... don't expect anything fancy, the place looks old and you definitely get that feeling when you walk in.  Also, CASH ONLY, so you better bring them, otherwise use the ATM machine by the main entrance to get cash... don't leave home without CASH!!!  When I visited, it wasn't busy, since it was spring break for the students.  We seated ourselves... then looked at the menu to decide what I wanted to get.  The waitress came and took our drink orders.... after our drink arrived, I asked what was the most popular and she informed me that it was cheesesteak, but I wasn't into it, so I decided to go with cornbeef and cheese with no onions.    The server wasn't happy nor sad, she just seemed preoccupied, as she wasn't that friendly... maybe because she was the only one working the floor? I don't know, but she didn't make me feel welcomed while I was there... but again, serve all depends on who you get, thus the person we got today... well, let's just say she wasn't having a good day.  So we get our food... the sandwich is piled high, since they put the french fries and cole slaw on top of the meat.... (you can ask them on the side if you want)... but a True sandwich lover will never do that!  Prepare to open your mouth wide open.... if you can unlock your jaw, do it!  I ate the 1/2 of the sandwich, then the 2nd half, I deconstructed to try each item separately to how they held up on their own....  Cornbeef - the meat was good, not salty...   French Fries - tasted like they cut them on site, but little soggy in my opion  Cole Slaw - the look and feel of the slaw reminds me of the Carolina's style... but it's very very BLEND.... need more salt and other seasoning.  Of all the sandwich shops I've been in Midwest, East & West coast... Primanti Brothers  doesn't fall on my top 10.... one thing that keeps bringing people - the cost... the sandwiches are cheap!!  If you are in Pittsburg, swing by and try it for yourself... see if Primanti Brothers stack up to other deli shops you've visited.",

After the fun of navigating the downtown area, we found Primanti Bros. and went inside. The place was fairly crowded, but not too bad considering the Pittsburgh Marathon had just ended. Seating is quick and our waitress came quickly. She was very nice and she had that gruff, old-Pittsburgh way about her. The food came pretty quickly. I had the sirloin strip sandwich (I think that's the name; if not it's something similar). The sandwich was decent. The Italian bread was crispy and the cole slaw and fries on the sandwich (something I've never had before) were good too. However, the small piece of meat was mediocre and unsatisfying. Overall, Primanti Bros. is a decent place to eat, but I'm sure there are better options in Pittsburgh (I'm not that familiar with the area though).",

    "text": "Going through my old reviews and finding that this place was my second review ever on Yelp and that was over four years ago and add to that that I only reviewed it with two sentences is just not right, so I need to redo that and serve it some justice.  Especially since this is the original location.  I still stand by my original review, sit at the bar area for quick service and some entertainment as the sandwiches are under construction.  This location is great, especially at the wee hours of the morning when you are finishing up your night out and want some food to help you on your way home.  In all honesty this place is like an after party spot.  People just seem to show up and cram inside.  The only scary place here are the restrooms located in the basement (you all know what I mean).  The food is excellent and not just during those wee hours.  It is something that can be feeling at anytime during the day.  I'm actually making myself hungry thinking about it right now.  I want myself a Jumbo, my go to sandwich when I come here.  When you think about it, you are getting a complete meal that you can hold in your hands, well mostly hold in your hands, it is inevitable that you will be dropping something out of that sandwich.  Meat and cheese cooked fresh on the griddle topped with hand cut fries, tomato and a heaping handful of Cole slaw; all that between thick sliced Italian bread.  Tell me that isn't heaven.  I may hear a few people talking about how that isn't their thing, a messy sandwich loaded with food where you just might have to wear a bib, but not to worry, they do have other things to eat.  It may not be many things, but they do carry chili and vegetable soup.  They also have those fries that you can order sans sandwich.  If you do, you must try the Smallman Street Fries.  These fries are topped with their chili, cheese, jalapenos and I'm fairly sure that I'm forgetting something else here, but they are so good, maybe even a bit unnecessary if you order a sandwich but totally worth it.    Let us touch on the fact how beloved Primanti Brothers is in Pittsburgh.  You can talk smack  all you want about the rest of the city, but once you say something bad about a sammich from Primantis you will be labeled a jagoff and possibly get a beating.  It is a Pittsburgh institution as many other reviewers, national publications and television shows have said.  You mess with it, you mess with the city and troves of dedicated fans of Primantis.    *Later tonight I just might stop by here.",

One of my favorite things to do on Saturday was drive and spend a couple of hours shopping for produce in the Strip District topped off with a stop at Primanti Bros.  This was in the days when this was the only store and the others elsewhere in PA and Florida had not opened yet.  Occassionally I'll hit the one in Harmarville or Greensburg and I have hit the store in Ft. Lauderdale a couple of years ago when I went to the Keys.  In anycase, this is still my favorite.  For those who do not know, The Strip District is a Strip of block alongside the old railroad tracks where the trains arriving with produce would be offloaded. Primanti Bros was established to feed these workers.    Food is good, Food is simple, Food is quick because these guys did not have long to eat hence putting the french fries on the burger.  Was in town last weekend and decided to give them a try to see if it was as I remembered.  There have been some changes but in the end, it's the same Primanti's.  Had the same burger with french fries on top as I did 25 years ago. Still juicy and cooked perfectly with great flavor.  Service is the same and despite the updates, the atmosphere from the 1930's still prevails.  The rest of the Strip District is changing and not necessarily for the better but Primanti's remains the same.",

You've just got to know what you're getting yourself into. This isn't for the dainty.   The sandwiches have french fries on them. That is really all I should have to type here. But I'll elaborate to whip your tastebuds into a frenzy. This Pittsburgh tradition is a must visit and the food is made fresh and depending on where you sit, right in front of your face. The no-nonsense staff is nice but direct, so no fancy substitutions or off the wall requests. Besides the food is perfect the way it is. My #1 is the cheesesteak. Massive and every bite as tasty as the last, it comes complete with tomato, coleslaw, fries and meat. I kick mine up a notch with ketchup but they always have hot sauce around too. One addition people seem to like is an egg on top, whatever floats your boat!   Every location has its own personality but this one is the original and best if you ask me. Grab a Yuengling  lager to wash it all down, especially if you're from the west cause sadly you won't see it out there.",

The inside is indescribable to me but reminds me if applebees met a subway. The service here is rude service intentionally, very short and in a hurry.   I wasn't blown away with the sandwiches and I don't get what the big deal is. I wasn't really amazed by them. I suppose its just the pittsburgh thing to do, one thing off my bucket list.   Cash only.   I'd come back here.",

Let's just say there are tons of better sandwich places out there.  I came here on a saturday around lunch time with a bunch of friends and had to stand outside in a line for about 15 minutes.  If it weren't for all the hype, I would have never waited in line for such a mediocre meal.  I don't understand why this place is so popular.  The bread is nothing special, just your ordinary white bread, which was soggy by the time the food comes out.  The fires were nothing special, just added carbs.  The sandwich was over-powered by the coleslaw, which i normally like.  I tried the pastrami, hot sausage, and steak sandwich, and all were definitely not worth the hype.  They all came out soggy and tasted like coleslaw.  My recommendation is to come to this place if you are truly interested in all the hype you see on the food network, but don't come in expecting much.",

I've visited there before during the week, and it was only marginally better then, so they blew their shot at redemption. Service was surly, sarcastic and inefficient. Sandwich (Pitts-Burgher cheese steak) was just okay-fries were fresh and hot (maybe I got lucky) and the cole slaw was tasty, but the pitifully small quantity of meat (maybe 2 oz. per sandwich) was galling; basically, I had a small cole slaw sandwich between two slices of cold white bread.  This place is incredibly overrated-honestly, don't subscribe to the hype and just skip it.  What a shame.  For what it's worth, I recently went to the Fort Lauderdale Beach location, and had a completely different experience entirely;  service was friendly and attentive, and my sandwich actually had meat in it!  I was very satisfied, and intend to visit that location again. Not sure how they lost the handle in Pittsburgh, and I sincerely hope they get it back.",

Let's just say I was a little pissed off at myself for agreeing to share one.  The bread was so soft and wonderful, but my favorite part was the pairing of the pastrami with the fries.  What a perfect combination!  The cole slaw added freshness and crunch without overpowering the other flavors and there was nothing greasy about this sandwich.

The sandwich: two slices of big soft i-talian bread, meat, cheese, slaw, fries, tomato, onions... that's right, cole slaw and french fries IN the sammich... the parts as individual food stuffs might not be incredibly amazing... but they way they put it all together, the Primanti way, adds up to a magical sum that is much greater than its individual parts. The softness of the bread wraps itself around the ingredients into one scrumptious mess. Try to open wide and bite into that! Delicious! Borrowing the words of the legendary late great Steelers sportscaster Myron Cope,  \"Yoi! Double Yoi!\"  That's one fine tasty sammich.",

If you expect anything more from it--good service or creative menu, you might find yourself being disappointed.   There is something about eating a huge sandwich that can suffice for an entire meal (or two) that is kind of fun. Plus, no one looks elegant while eating one of these sandwiches. Consider them your own personal equalizer. Plus, their beer is pretty cheap and the salt and grease in the sandwiches can make you pretty thirsty. However, the service, at all of the locations I have visited, leaves a little something to be desired. Ranging from slightly bad to willfully rude.   Downton location only takes cash, so beware! The Market Square location is great for people watching, but truly horrendous service. The more suburban locations pretty much feel like your average sports bar, so you're really only going for the sandwich at this point, not the experience.   If you do go to Pittsburgh, it's totally a must. Just don't expect it to be anything it isn't.",

    "text": "Saw Primanti Brothers on Man vs. Food and had heard about it from some friends in Pittsburgh and others that had visited.  Very good sandwich, lots of history, unique menu. So why did I rate Primanti's as 4 stars and not 5?  Reason #1- Although I thought it was a very good sandwich, it wasn't great. For Mike to give your sandwich 5 stars, it has to be great. Every sandwich is topped with fries and Cole slaw. I've never been a big fan of the slaw, so this was a negative for me and probably just made it a really good sandwich, instead of great.  Reason #2- Unfair expectations. Based on all of the hype, I went in to Primanti's expecting to eat the best sandwich I've ever had. That's a high bar for any sandwich to achieve.  I do love the vast variety of sandwich options on the menu and would love to go back and try some others. I ordered the Black Angus Steak sandwich the first time and then went back later that night and ordered the Double Egg and cheese.   Definitely an above average sandwich, just not the best sandwich I've ever had.",

Place was packed, luckily there were only 2 of us and we found a seat pretty quickly. What's not to love!? A burger with fries, coleslaw on yummy Italian bread and a cold beer. Delicious! My husband, who hates coleslaw even loved!  This place seems to be a Pittsburgh staple and we make sure everyone we know who is visiting Pittsburgh goes. If they are confused after our burger description, we have them watch Man Vs. Food, after that they can't wait to try it!  Will definitely be going back ! Unfortunately it will be during football season, hopefully we will get in! Not sure about the Jet fans we will be bringing with us =)",

Well, a vinegary coleslaw, flavorless bread and soggy french fries will do it. The vinegar overpowers the rest of the sandwich and it is all you can taste.  I just don't understand what all of the fuss is about. I heard so much about the legendary sandwiches, only to be greatly disappointed. I refuse to give up on french fries in a sandwich, but I do give up on Primanti's. I'm sorry Pittsburgh, please don't hate me.",

(Especially if you have post East Carson Street pub crawl munchies.  Their South Side location is open till 2am).  You'll want to handle one of these quickly - they tend to go a little limp as the bread and fries get soggy from the slaw.  Generally speaking, they are a bit much for me between the bread and fries.  Not to mention, I prefer my sides on the side, but to do so at Primanti Brothers - it just ain't right.",

I grew up on the sandwich- so I have been eating ham  egg and cheese at Pramanti's  in the strip for over 40 years.  When I was a kid we would stay up late and go a midnight when they opened and they only had one location.  When they expanded to Oakland and other remote spots the place changed- but they still were good eats- then they sold and it has been a downhill trip.  The sandwichs are no longer unique but copied all over even at Eat n Park- the bread - the size - the love and care the quality of the slaw and the meats are all gone- now it is stadium food and it should be no surprise that you can buy them at PNC Park.  What really makes me mad is that is the official food of Pittsburgh and it is not very good.  Boo Hoo.  It also shocks me how loyal the city is to a long gone past.  Try something new or hope someone at Pramanti's will fix the failed sandwichs.",

I ventured over to the burgh fo a few days and everyone mentioned this place to me, but when hanging out with them, they wanted to go somewhere else to eat...so, the last day, i ventured over here solo and got a dose of one mega sandwich.  The rustic, diner like environment gave me a taste of what to expect, but man was i wrong. Upon ordering the waiters quickly sid, whadaya want! I went with the pastromi and she quicly threw a few slabs on the grill, topped with cheese. As she prepped that one, I saw the finishing touches of some other orders. OH MY GOSH ThoSE ARE HUGE.  2 thick slices of bread, greasy meat with cheese though tasty...then samshed on top were thick layers of french fried and a nice does of cole slaw!! this monster was probably 6-7 inches tall.....Many newbies remarked, how are we suppose to eat this, and they just said \"smash it down and enjoy\"  I'd love to give this place a 5 for uniqueness, but it is not something I'd go to everyday, nor even weekely. It's more of a \"damn, you have to give it a try\" place. Throw some hot sauce of an egg to give it a good mix of flavor.  I give it a 3 mainly cause my style of food is the type I can eat a few times a week.  This place is great, but after the first time, your like, uhggg, i feel ill, but love it.",

    "text": "Went here after seeing Primanti Brothers featured on Man v. Food.    Er, yeah...is this the best diner food Pittsburgh has to offer?     The sandwiches were totally bland, and although tall, not very big. They weren't particularly appetizing. I opted to not finish mine even though I definitely could have if I had wanted to. The bread was sort of cheap. Flavorless fries, and I'm pretty sure the only condiment I found was ketchup, or possibly hot sauce. I don't remember which overstuffed sandwich I ordered. I only remember the bitter taste of disappointment. I don't think it was all that cheap for what you get, either.     Primanti Brothers may have invented the overstuffed sandwich, but it seems like they have been resting on their laurels ever since...I don't know...the Industrial Revolution? (or whenever they first came up with the idea). The Panini's franchise in Cleveland, Ohio does overstuffed sandwiches better, and I'm not saying this because of some dumb, imaginary football rivalry, either.     What was really poor was the atmosphere of Primanti Brothers. The place is located by the river. Outside of Primanti Bros, there was this overpowering rotting fish smell. It was either rotting fish or loading dock garbage, but it smelled rather bad. The ladies room was terrifying. It was down a steep flight of stairs into this dank, dark concrete basement. I saw a cockroach in the ladies room, which was what I imagined a prison bathroom would look like. I'm not even sure if they have wheelchair accessible restrooms here (you might want to check before you make the trek).     My overall experience with Primanti Brothers was that its reputation as a good sandwich place is mostly hype.",

    "text": "Pittsburgh Original!  For any of you other interlopers: Expect a MASSIVE sandwich filled with fries and slaw.  The slaw isn't southern style- more of an oil and vinegar type that's not very runny.  Went with a friend who said he hated coleslaw and liked it!  This location is CASH ONLY and parking can get a little rough during busier hours.  We went at 9am and had sandwiches, beer, and zero issues.  Something anyone not from Pittsburgh should definitely take the time to check out.  And seriously: listen to your local friends.  This paricular location DOES taste different than the others!",

I'm definitely coming back here :) I love how they don't use plates and just put the sandwiches on wax paper and serve it to you. It's a neat idea!",

On this trip, I was able to fit it in - it was an experience that I don't need to experience again.   I hadn't looked at the reviews so I didn't realize that it was so limiting - essentially a meat and cheese on gigantic white bread with vinegar based coleslaw and fries. I asked the server for a recommmendation and went with the pastrami and cheese - it was fine - a huge sandwhich and I was super hungry and was able to eat most of it but it's just not my thing. Kudos to Primanti for knowing how to provide a big sandwich with just the right balance of toppings.  Only the coleslaw overflowed. They go light on the cheese but it's a good thing.  You will be full after eating here and probably will not want to eat anything or look at food for a long while.  Vegetarians and people on gluten free diets should stay away in my opinion - the options would be very very limiting.",

When I get back to Pittsburgh, I always make an attempt to eat at Primanti Brothers. These sandwhichs are delicious, and impossible to imitate. They stack griddle cooked meats, prefectly seasoned cole-slaw, and fries on squishy white bread in a heavenly combination. The sandwhiches are whipped out on pieces of wax paper and the whole atmoshpere of the place is quick and gruff; get in, eat, and out.  I was out with my good friend Callen and we split two different sandwiches, the pastrami and the capicola. Both were excellent, but I prefer the pastrami, which in my mind, is the best and most classic sandwich they serve. There's actually a lot of options on the menu, but stick to the sandwhiches.  I love this place, its a Pittsburgh institution, and I recommend everyone to hit it up when your in Pittsburgh, and regularly if you live there.",

A few weeks ago, after a lot of anticipation, I got the chance to eat just like that and man it was good.  A big part of the appeal is the ability to know what people are talking about when they mention Primanti's and Pittsburgh in the same breath.  The sandwich was really satisfying, not legendary, but it definitely left me a happy customer.  The real draw is the feel of the neighborhood, the weathered dining room and the short-winded wait staff.  The sandwich is just something to do while your taking it all in.  I thought the coleslaw-fry-pastrami-sandwich-beast was going to put me to sleep, but it wasn't even that filling.  The fluffy white bread really gave intimidating size impression, but you'll be able to finish it off no problem.",

It's  - Historical: Back when the steel business was booming, the workers needed an all-in-one one-handed meal they could eat at work.  Primanti's famous sandwich provided an answer with their super sandwiches.  Pittsburgh is now known for putting potatoes or fries on all kinds of stuff (salads, perogies, etc.).  If you've never been to Primanti's you should go, if nothing else for the historicity.   - The Food:  The sandwich is smartly made.  The German-style slaw isn't too sour, the fries aren't too salty, and the bread is fresh.  This combination of cheap, fill-ingredients makes for a tasty affordable sandwich.   - The Hype: Fame has diminished the Primanti's experience over the years.  Service doesn't have to be good, because people will continue to eat here regardless.  Prices have risen over the years, and still there are lines out the door every weekend.  The quality of sandwich itself hasn't changed over the time I've been here as far as I can tell.",

As we came in, a waitress told us to just sit wherever we'd like. Service came to us quickly and was very helpful.  Although she wasn't as friendly, she seemed to know her stuff. However, the place was busy so she probably was very busy herself. The food came out to us in less than 5 minutes. I got the roast beef and cheese sandwich with onions and my friend got the Pitt-burger. We also got an extra side of fries. Everything was great!

What drives me insane is that my hometown Grove City, now has a Primanti's (where you can get the \"Pittsburgh experience\" if you're so agoraphobic and/or lost your license due to too many DUI's to take the 50 minute drive to the actual city where Primanti's came from).  I honestly think the sheen has worn off of this place though with the emergence of more praise-worthy options.  I know I sound like an obnoxious blowhard, but I have the truth on my side (and you know it, 64 year old retired truck driver from Braddock who is currently on their 14th Budlight while reading this review in their local library).  Sorry, I grew up poor, this isn't a class issue.    WOW EVERYBODY....THE FRIES ARE ON THE SANDWICH...WOWWW, NOW I CAN BROWSE MYSPACE (another outdated institution) WHILE GETTING OUT OF BREATH BECAUSE USING YOUR THUMBS IS HARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRD.  The restaurant in and of itself is perfecty adequate.  But why the mythology?  We don't need to brag about it anymore.  Primanti's represents Pittsburgh now about as well as General Tso's represents China's military history.  MAKE PITTSBURGH GREAT AGAIN and stop Primanti's from riding the coattails of it's resurgence!  IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND:  The Mike Love-led Beach Boys.  No one should care about them anymore, their best days with Brian Wilson are behind them.",

I remember we would go to Pittsburgh to hang out, drink and then one day a friend said we've gotta go to Primanti's.  It's so good.  they put fires and slaw on the sandwiches.  HUH?!?!?  I despise soggy bread and the thought of runny slaw (like kfc) being on my sandwich grossed me out.  But after having multiple and probably 3 too many drinks, we ended up here.  Kielbasa double meat plz, no tomatoes.   Well, the slaw is not runny, it's lightly dressed with vinegar and IDK what else.  I always take off about half of the French Fries and half of the slaw because they can be too much and I just eat them on the side.   Overall, it is not the best sandwich Ive ever eaten but it is a pretty tasty sandwich, not just when I was tipsy :) Now....the restrooms on the other hand....ICKY.  Do not go in the basement lol.  Smells like sewer and is just not right down there.  But when you're tipsy, nothing seems that bad :)",

    "text": "Quite the Pittsburgh experience.  I had been years ago when I went to college in the area; this past weekend, I was in town with my parents and wife, so we went back.  We had to wait in a bit of a line for the original location (since 1933!) but the manager (owner?) was fair and kept things moving.  He had a good sense of humor and smaller parties (2-3 people) were able to be sat more quickly.  Once inside, service was good (no complaints).  Portions are good; food was tasty.  They serve the sandwiches on wax paper; so minimalist; quick to clean up, no dishes, not much waste.  I love the soft, white Italian bread used to make the sandwich.  My only complaint, if you will, is that my sandwich could have used a little more meat on it (they give you an option to double the meat; oh, and I did get an egg on mine as well).  The fries were good (hand-cut, and pretty thick).  Remember, cash only.  Also, parking in the area is tough, but we totally lucked out and got a spot right by Primanti Brothers that is reserved for customers and was free!  We walked around the strip a little after lunch... is a very fun area (we were there on a Saturday around lunch time).  With two beers, four sandwiches, and an order of cheese-fries, our total (with tip) came to $43... not too shabby for lunch out for four adults.",

Also had heard (or read, I can't remember now) several positive comments elsewhere that suggested this is THE place in Pittsburgh for lunch.   We wandered in and took seats at the counter. There were families, businessmen, couples, and singles filling the place. After looking around a few minutes we were greeted by a waitress who took our order. They don't have menus, just big signs on the wall.   My husband and I split a cheesesteak which came with fries on it (a great selling point!) and coleslaw ON the sandwich. I guess there is a reason they call it a \"Philly\" cheesesteak other places, and we should have realized that a cheesesteak in Pitt. isn't the same.   The fries on the sandwich were really good. The meat was okay, it was more like a meatloaf sandwich to me, and the coleslaw was more on the vinegary side than sweet. Again, I probably should have know this going in, but I'm not from Pitts. so I didn't. If you're into those kinds of things, this is your place. If not, it's not. It was pretty tasty for what it was, but wouldn't be my first choice again.",

My brother-in-law lives in the Iron City and we went back for a visit from Austin this past weekend so we had the golden opportunity to try the sandwich.   We met at the main location in the Strip District and let him order. That was probably a mistake, because his meat of choice was not what Richman ordered. Rather, we got the steak sandwich, which is funny because it is not really steak, maybe Salisbury steak, but no rib-eye or anything like that. The sandwich was good, but not great. I had them add the fried egg as well, because my arteries needed the additional clogging.   I think I would have enjoyed the sandwhich more had I ordered the pastrami instead. Oh well, maybe next time. This is the kind of food you should eat only about once or twice a decade anyway.",

    "text": "Sorry to have bothered you....  I don't even know where to begin.  I really wish I had the option to give negative stars.  I have NEVER had such a horrible experience at a restaurant.  We were from out of town visiting some friends and decided to go to the downtown location for lunch after shopping the strip.  We walk in and are pointed to a table to go to from a dark haired waitress who looked like we were interrupting her relaxation and wanted to be any where but there.  Our lovely table was situated between an overflowing garbage can and the wall where the menu was located.  As I crank my head around to attempt to read the menu another cranky blonde waitress comes over barking at us for our drink order.  We asked if we could split the check and were sternly informed we could tell them what we had when we checked out.  We get our drinks and are again barked at to place our food order.  At this point the garbage keeps getting more and more overflowing and my friend is disgusted so we moved to the table next to us which was empty along with pretty much every other table in the place.  Dark haired waitress looks at us like we just crapped on the floor.   I take a sip from my drink and look at the lemon and notice it is covered in dirt.  As blonde waitress plops down soggy fries to two people in our party I nicely inform her about the nasty lemon and without so much of an apology she takes my drink to begrudgingly make me a new one.  At this point I am thoroughly in shock by how rude the staff has been.  Then as the two in our party are finishing their soggy fries a gentleman comes out to deliver the rest of our order.  He is shouting names of items we did not order and is getting more and more aggravated we do not know what he is talking about.  Finally I tell him he might want to treat his costumers with a little more respect.  We finally figure out the items and he plops down sandwiches on what seems to be wax paper where half of the fries fly on the table which I could only assume has not been cleaned well by the staffs lack of motivation.  We were all confused by the sandwiches as we were never informed that the fries we were getting were actually on the sandwich along with a big lump of coleslaw that tasted like it was all vinegar.  My one friend ordered a Pittsburger which seemed to be what she described as a \"dehydrated mystery meat\" and couldn't even eat it.  She was however still thirsty and being she ran out of soda 10 minutes prior and no one asked if she wanted a refill I called the dark haired waitress over and asked her if she could get one.  She literally rolled her eyes and sighed.  At that point I mentioned I was so sorry to bother her.  It got to the point I really wanted to speak to a manager but with the demeanor of everyone we encountered I figured it was pointless.  We went to check out where the rude gentleman could not read our ticket and we left.  I'm a big tipper everywhere we go even if we have to wait for our food or if a waitress gets backed up and can't take care of us right away because that typically is not their fault and everyone has off days, I worked in the restaurant business, I know how it goes but this was literally unbelievable and the worst dining experience I ever had.  I almost thought we were on a hidden tv show because it was so bad.  Needless to say I waked out without giving them any sort of a tip and would never give them a dime of my business again.  A hint Primanti Brothers people do not have to give them your business I support local businesses because I'd like to see them survive but with your staff's attitude good luck with that.  I'm assuming you do survive because the drunks that go there after the club don't give a shit as to their service or the quality of food just something to fill the void.",

    "text": "After the initial novelty of fries and coleslaw on a sandwich, Primanti Bros is quite ordinary. However, there is no denying the sandwich is tasty and enjoyable.  There are few foods that encapsulates a city and are easily identifiable as a Primanti Bros sandwiches. Its as synonymous with Pittsburgh as the Steelers, the steel industry, and the Three Rivers. When ever I am in town I always swing by to grab one. I love it!  This sandwich's main attraction is its amalgamation of meat, cheese, coleslaw and fries. It was Epic Meal Time before EMT got big on the internets. That being said, its quite plain and, in all honesty, boring. The meats and cheeses are your standard deli meats. The slaw is pretty dull with no acid, color, or salt. The fries are, well, fries. The bread is super soft and thick, but that softness yields to the juices that can create a sloppy mess toward the end of the sandwich. Now, just when you think I'm hating on this beast, I do have to say that it tastes better than the individual components in an act of culinary synergy. This is definitely one of the places that I seek out after a late night when ever I'm in the 'Burgh.  The other things I don't like is that this place is cash only. I get it, but its very inconvenient. I wish I owned a restaurant that had the gravitas to be cash only, so I'm a bit jealous! The other thing is that the service is inconsistent. Some of the servers are very energetic and entertaining and very welcoming. In fact, on a recent trip, he forgot our beer when we ordered it. After reminding him we ordered beers, he gave it to us on the house. Now THAT is service! The most recent time, I walked in after my train got in to the Amtrak station at 5:30 am. It seemed that the people working there were confused that someone was in so early. It took a long time to order and an inordinate amount of time to get my food despite being one of three people in the place. Oh well, life goes on.  Anyway, this place is an institution. A trip to Pittsburgh isn't complete without stepping into the hallowed ground of Primanti's and scarfing down a piece of Americana!",

    "text": "While on a road trip we decided to stop and stay over in Pittsburgh, PA.  Looking on Google for \"things to do in Pittsburgh\"/\"what to not miss in Pittsburgh\" we saw that Primanti Brothers was on the list, so we decided that we should experience the wonder of the Primanti sandwiches.  Primanti Brothers is open 24 hours a day and has a small parking lot attached for customer parking.  If you get there after 6pm street parking is open, so you should have several options.  The restaurant is a lot of fun to look at.  You can tell it has been around for a long time (80 years).  The walls are covered in framed newspaper articles reviewing the restaurant, pictures of celebrities at the restaurant, and t-shirts that say \"Bite Me...Primanti Brothers.\"  They are a cash only facility, but there is an ATM in the front in case you don't have any cash on you.  The kitchen is open and you can sit in that room or the attached room where the bar is located.  The restaurant can be compared to an old diner or sandwich shop where you can find the menu on a placard on the wall.  All but three of the sandwiches are meat heavy.  If you are not a meat eater then you may choose one of two fish sandwiches, an egg sandwich, or a cheese sandwich.  All sandwiches come with a heaping helping of fries, cole slaw, and tomato piled on top of your sandwich filling choice, and stuffed in between two thick pieces of white bread.  I split a cheese deluxe sandwich with my girlfriend.  She really enjoyed her half of the sandwich, complimenting the cook for getting the greasiness of the fries just perfect.  I was not as pleased with my half.  I enjoyed the cole slaw, it added a bit of tang and tart crispness to a rather dull sandwich.  They were not at all generous with the amount of cheese in the sandwich, the bread was quite tasteless, and the fries were soggy and flavorless.  I added some salt to the fries and that made a world of difference, but I still wasn't a fan.    I'm glad I went to the restaurant and experienced this Pittsburgh staple but I  could  have skipped it and that would have been fine too.  The sandwich was reasonable priced, so I didn't lose out too much.",

The guys were super friendly and everything was quick.   I loved the pastrami sandwich that was filled with pastrami, cheese, cole slaw (even tho I'm not normally a fan) and fries. There is no right way of eating it OR a clean way of eating it for that matter. It WILL fall apart on you. I was ambitious and got the hot chilli also which I was glad I did ... but my stomach yelled at me for stuffing so much in there in one sitting.

    "text": "Pretty much a Pittsburgh tradition as best I can tell. Everyone seems to have heard of this place. I can understand why. It isn't all that often that you get a sandwich with french fries (and coleslaw if you like that sort of thing) on it.  Food was all good enough, I suppose. Had the hot sausage sandwich without the slaw. They have all sorts of sandwich choices. Cheap prices! There were 6 of us and our bill was about $45! I just thought it was a little flat. I think crispier fries would have helped. And it could just use more flavor.  The building is smallish but has lots of character. And you can watch them make the food right there so there is no mystery involved. How do you keep fries and slaw on a sandwich when they are piled on? Smash it all together of course! Everything is done simply. No plates or silverware needed. That makes it sound like it would be messy but it somehow isn't.  We had to wait 15-20 minutes on a Friday afternoon. Sounds like they take reservations so you might consider that. Though if you have fewer people, you would get a seat faster.  If you are visiting Pitt, I'm pretty sure a trip to Primanti Bros. is basically a requirement, but don't expect anything out of this world good.  Tradition seems to be it's biggest draw.",

I don't mean you should get as much meat as some of the ridiculous delis in NYC, but enough to realize there is meat in the sandwich with all the other stuff they pile on.

You either like this kind of food or you don't.  For those who find it bland as served, salt, pepper, ketchup and hot sauce are readily available.",

Two slices of at least an inch thick of tasteless white bread.  ONE slice of turkey heated on the grill so it was rubbery with perhaps a half of a slice of cheese.  Tasteless tomatoes.  A row of french fries that tasted as if the oil in the fryers had not been changed since they opened the restaurant.  A cup full of coleslaw that was so filled with vinegar that it almost tasted like medicine.  The cheese fries were also disgusting since the oil they were fried in gave them an almost rancid taste.  Don't waste your money.  I have no idea how this place survives and is open 24 hours a day.  It was 1 p.m. and the floor was so dirty it looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a week or more.",

Overall the sandwich was pretty good. The hubs got the Pittsburger with an egg. Meat was moist and flavorful and cooked to a medium doneness. I would've rated it higher, but we had to ask twice for a highchair. Also, the seating was a bit confusing. When we entered, there was a group of customers scurrying for the door and the tables. I think that you're supposed to seat yourself, we did.",

Hubby got the pastrami sandwich (a much better choice, IMO) and I got the Pitts-burger. Both sandwiches were just...not worth a review, to be honest. It seems like Primanti tries to build impressive, Insta-worthy sandwich volume by piling bland slaw and soggy french fries on cheap white bread, and cuts corners on the actual meat quantity and quality. Oh, and maybe I'm being a princess here, but an actual plate would be nice.   This is the original Primanti Bros. location, for what it's worth, so I guess if you want to underwhelm your Pittsburgh visitors with a disappointing sandwich, choose the Strip District location.",

We got there on a weekday around 3 p.m.  Place was nearly empty, so we could sit at the bar.  I order the Pittsburgher, wife had the bacon and cheese.   Also order the Smallman Fries (cheese, jalapenos and sour cream).  Expectations for this meal were high.  Food came quick and as I took my first bit I immediately noticed that I couldn't taste anything.  The bread felt soft, but the only taste in my mouth was a ton of vinegar laced slaw.  It completely overwhelmed the sandwich.  The \"Pittsburgher\" patty had no flavor and seemed like it had been warmed up in a microwave.  Just a bunch of microwaved sadness buried in there.  The fries on the sandwich were lukewarm at best and not crispy.  Wife had the exact same thought about her sandwich.  She ended up picking out the bacon and left everything else on the sandwich in place.    Smallman fries were a gooey mess.  Again, fries have to be crispy, and especially when they are literally buried in a ton of tasteless nacho cheese, sour cream and whatever else was on them.    Just gonna say it:  This place is incredibly overrated.  I can't see how anyone would think this is good.  Was incredibly disappointed.  If this place is great food in Pittsburgh, the bar is set pretty low.",

    "text": "During my weekend trip to Pittsburgh, I knew there was one place I had to try other than Meat & Potatoes. Primanti Brother's is a hometown classic that some may call a tourist trap, but for many it's the place to go after a late night of drinking.  Joe Primanti sold sandwiches in the Strip District during the Great Depression to hungry truckers looking for a filling, yet affordable meal. With sandwiches filled with fries, it's no surprise they became popular. Primanti Brothers changed hands a few times since, but current owner Jim Patrinos has been continuing the tradition for the past 40+ years.  Spicy Pub Pickles [$5.29]  I started with the spicy pub pickles, which were crisply battered and had the faintest hint of spice. These briny hits of goodness were accompanied by a pat of ranch dressing.  The Pitts-burgher [$6.89] + Fried Egg [$0.50]  Sadly, I was disappointed with what was designated as the #2 best sandwich here (read: it's a Primanti Brothers joke). I loved the bread, which was fresh, soft, and housed a huge mound of fries and slaw. The fries could have benefited from a crisper fry to provide some texture to each bite, but the tangy slaw really made each bite. And who can complain about the fried egg I added? But the steak was a sad sausage-like patty. If this was fresh-sliced steak grilled a la Philly style, this sandwich could have been money. But the consistency of the \"meat\" was sad to say the least. Next time I'll need to try some of the other sandwiches because unfortunately I was not having it with the meat on the Pittsburgher.",

However, it lacked the wow-factor for me.. with something that has no many things loaded into it, I'd expect a lot of flavor, but it just was not there.  The loaded fries were only OK to me.. even though they had cheese, chili, sour cream, and bacon bits on top it surprisingly tasted bland! It was just missing that oomph of flavor for me.

For lunch I had the capicola & cheese and for dinner enjoyed the pastrami & cheese. What makes these sandwiches unique is that they are made right in front of you and topped with slaw, tomato, and fresh cut french fries on French bread. The only decision you really have to make is what kind of meat you want on it. I clearly loved it since I ate there twice and maybe have had dreams of it since the occasion.

I guess I'm not the pramanti traditionalist because I eventually put my fries on the side and dipped them in ketchup.",

The sandwich looked thick but it was mostly the bread and fries that made it look this way.  The meat itself looked to be a piece of meat and a piece of cheese under all the fries.  The bread was tasty as it tasted like like rye.  All sandwiches come with fries and cole slaw within the sandwich.  The cole slaw is a sweet and sour base instead of a mayo base.     I gave 3 stars as the sandwich was average among the other sandwich shops available to choose from in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "Is there any greater joy than trying a city's food specialty, the thing that locals can't stop talking about? Whether or not you actually love the item is kind of beside the point. When I heard about the Primanti's sandwich and how passionately people felt about this long-standing institution, I knew I had to give it a shot.   We're talking about a sandwich that comes on slices of white bread, your choice of meat, along with cole slaw and fries IN the sandwich. (Why is it that a local speciality is never a light, good for you, veggie-heavy dish?) You can go with a burger as the meat and then it's a Pittsburger. I went with the roast beef myself, and couldn't help but get a side of chili as well, which ended up being huge. It's a giant, messy sandwich eating experience and you just have to go for it and get your hands dirty. With no sauce on it I'd say it needed a bit more flavor, but it seems like the experts have their own ketchup and/or hot sauce solutions that greatly improve it. I was especially impressed by the cole slaw, which is crunchy and has a great flavor, which is probably due to a ton of sugar in it but I can't be sure.   I definitely wouldn't suggest getting this to go, as I would imagine that the bread and fries would get soggy immediately. Anyway it's more fun to eat it in this old location which doesn't look like it's ever been remodeled (which I loved), served all messy just on a piece of paper by a hilarious and friendly server.   Cash only, which isn't my favorite, but also open 24 hours which is just brilliant because though I give the sandwich a B+ at a normal hour, as a late-night snack after a night out I think I'd give it an A++++. A perfect example of an indulgent local treat that you've gotta try at least once!",

The sandwich was large but the make up of the sandwich had no flavor. The fries were bland and so was the coleslaw. Being from Carolina Cole slaw is a staple and it must be good. The sandwich was dry had no sauce. I'm full but if I come back to the city I will bypass this place.",

Old looking but service is incredibly friendly. They are known for putting french fries in their sandwiches and sauerkraut. Not a fan of sauerkraut but I would say its very unique tasting and gives a nice kick to the sandwich. We got the reuben, pastrami, kielbasa and pittburger. All great options! Don't forget to add the extra cheese, onions and egg.   But by far my favorite was the chili. It is truly.... amazing... hands off the best chili I ever bad. I will be back and I will definitely bring friends!!",

The staff was friendly when I first got in but totally ignored us once they started getting busy. I was so excited to try a Pittsburgh classic, but am surprised that people can ever return. I wonder if Primantis simply thrives from the unsuspecting tourists who come to Pittsburgh or the native Yinzers who come here for the nostalgia. In any case I found the sandwiches to be too greasy such that the poor sandwich bread couldn't even support the sloppiness of the sandwich innards. I say save your money and your waistline and avoid coming here.",

This was a good place to catch the end of the NBA Finals game, but the Pitts-Burger & Cheese was just ok. The beef was really bland, and there was nothing special about the cole slaw. The fries that they used for the sandwich were very good. I just started pouring on the hot sauce to make it better. I will say: the fact that this location is 24 hours makes me appreciate it far more. While the burger was average for sober Kamron, I could see this as an ideal spot for Pittsburghers after a night of drinking.",

So consider this a public service announcement for all who travel to Pittsburgh. We heard about Primanti Bros and saw that this place had a 4.5 star rating with 3,259 reviews. We ordered the Pitts-Burger . . After two bites we fed the rest to our dog. Can somebody explain to us what this is and why it is so highly rated? This burger patty has the consistency of an old school vegan patty (the kind from the frozen section by MorningStar, not the new Beyond Meat or Impossible Burgers).

    "text": "Delicious and over the top sandwiches that you should treat yourself to no more than twice a year   My dad and I were visiting Pittsburgh and saw this place on every \"must eat in Pittsburgh\" list. So we went and ordered two of their most famous sandwiches: the Pitts burger and the New Yorker.  This place really lives up to the hype. Their sandwiches are ginormous... it's like the size of the my face. Each is piled with thick layers of meat, cheese and FRIES.   Both sandwiches had the same base- thick white bread, fries, coleslaw, cheese, and onions (by request). The bread was very average. I thought it tasted a little dry actually... the fries were a bit too much, it overpowered the sandwich a bit. I LOVED the coleslaw. It's one of the best coleslaws I've tasted in a sandwich. It added a nice sour and crisp kick to the sandwiches, and it's crisp texture really cuts through the rest of the otherwise soft sandwich. The pitts burger had a very average beef patty as the meat, while the New Yorker had corned beef and pastrami, as well as some mustard. There is so much stuff in each of the sandwiches that the bottom pieces of bread literally got flattened before we even picked it up.   Honestly, I think that the taste of the sandwiches are themselves 4/5, but the presentation and service at the place gives it a solid 4.5.  The service was very fast - our sandwiches were served in 10-15 min. The staff is very friendly! The presentation of the sandwiches is very good - They are cut in half and served on parchment paper. The sandwiches are very photogenic and perfect for instagram/Snapchat/Yelp or any other social media platforms.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I were seated at the bar, the hostess did not ask us if this was okay. I usually do not care but there is little to no leg room at the bar when sitting normally. The menu is on the wall with no prices listed, so I asked for a menu with prices. Our waitress said they do not have any. So I asked what are the prices, which she said are generally $8-$10 for a sandwich. We ordered 2 sandwiches (hamburger, steakburger), my girlfriend asked for no coleslaw on her sandwich, the waitress asked if she could put it on the side so she can try it, which my gf said yes. I asked to add onions to mine. The other waiter at the bar brought out our food... to the wrong people and then gave us the same sandwiches after those people told him it wasn't their order. My girlfriend's hamburger had coleslaw on the sandwich. My sandwich didn't have onions on it. I kindly asked the waiter for a side of onions and a fork. He stonchly reacted,\"You ordered onions!?\" In disbelief. I told him \"yes\". He walked to the kitchen and on the way told a coworker that I didn't order onions. (He didn't take my order, so he wouldn't know). He brought out a fork, but he said, \"Do you know why you didn't get onions!?... because we are out.\" Truth or not, service from him was very rude and poor. Anyways, about the wait time and food quality = not bad :) , nothing special (3 out of 5). The bread is definitely a downer, the bread is like it came out of a loaf of bread from the grocery store, they don't even toast or put the bread on the grill. Overall recommendation: If you're around town, sure try it, but don't go out of your way to try this restaurant.",

I got the vegetarian option (the deluxe egg/cheese) and it hit the spot--and was surprisingly flavorful with the different sauces. The people I was with loved the options they got, and everyone left full (and possibly ready to take a nap). I'm personally a big fan of fries on anything, but as a heads up, the fries can get a bit soggy over time.   Overall, as someone who's never had a huuuge craving for sandwich, i was pleasantly surprised by the great service and comfort food!",

There was a time that Primanti  was probably the best. There was a time that their sandwiches were probably jaw dropping and awe-inspiring however, that time has passed.  Much like a Pat's or Geno's here we have another iconic Pennsylvania restaurant that by name alone manages to draw crowds and visitors. And much like Pat's and Geno's these once inventive sandwiches have been recreated and remade by countless others who have actually improved on the original recipes. So what do these iconic names do to retain their prestige?!?!? Nothing! No changes, no improvement they just live off the what was....and some how it continues to work for them?!?!?   I had the Primanti Cheese Steak: Cheese, Steak, Egg, Fries, Slaw, Tomato. Fries could have been good if seasoned. Egg was a nice surprise...I forgot they did that. Steak was meh!   I'm not sure that going to a place to \"say I've been there\" or \"for the experience\" is good enough anymore...the experience of what?!?! Subpar food?!?!? Yay me, I settled for crap!",

There's a reason this place is a Pittsburgh landmark.    My party of four sat down right away in a corner surrounded by hand painted murals.  We immediately put in orders for Cheese Fries and Smallman Street Fries (w/ cheese, chili, bacon, jalapenos, and sour cream).  We all ordered the Pitts-Burger, which is their version of a cheesesteak, served on fluffy, white, Italian bread and stacked with Primanti fries, their famous coleslaw, onions, and tomatoes.  Though not as good as Philly Cheesesteaks, this almost comes close.    The prices here are great (about 8 for a massive sandwich and 4 for a heap of Smallman Street Fries).  The murals around the restaurant add an awesome touch to the restaurant, and the place reeks of Pittsburgh culture (in a good way!).  This is a must visit for anyone strolling through the Strip District in Pittsburgh.",

Ordering was at ease and with a smile..preparation....I hate when the grill keeps mix and match the food all over the place, I mean you had pastrami cooking near ham, and eggs near roast beef.... Maybe I like my taste specific to what I ordered. That being said went with the big fish sandwich with some hot  peppers. Upon opening the bag, i found a hefty sandwich which was a good starting point. The bread which I was a bit skeptical about actually tasted real good, fresh and a bit of tangy taste which i always like. The fish was about 9 inch filled with slaw & tomatoes. Overall not bad and worth a try but not overwhelmingly wow..... That being said what I did notice while watching them make the other sandwiches was their a bit shy with the meats, I mean who eats pastrami with 4 slices, the top off are the fries and slaw which adds to the size....one time try for me",

We asked later for a refill and he just looked at us and said \"okay.\"  He acted like we were inconveniencing him the whole time we were there. VERY UNPLEASANT!",

I had a 2hr layover in Pittsburgh. I knew, from this city being my second home that Primanti Bros  was not far from here. I had been there many a-times, at late hours over the past 16yrs. I first called asking,  \"walking\" directions from the station..... I was really looking forward to getting some food and being prepared for my long 7hr journey lol.  This was Tuesday, March 4th at 4am..... It was 3 degrees (I was determined. I had also already called mind you)  When I got there all the chairs were turned up. (never seen that before there) This place advertises 24hrs, dine in!  I was told by the husky red-head I couldn't sit after walking in sub zero temps, that eating in was closed! I even mentioned NICELY that I had called and  walked there! (I got rude hipster sneer \"NO\") He told me they had a 50 sandwich order and that's why they were \"closed\" (inside) AT 4AM? This restaurant is doing that much business that my cold ass can't sit inside for 25min (at the most!?!?)  AFTER 16YRS, NEVER NEVER EVER WILL I GIVE THESE SADISTIC A**HOL*S ANY OF MINE,  MY CLIENTS or (with) FRIENDS MY MONEY!!! I felt I was fed some sort of excuse, and to deny any customer, even if they ordered Cole Slaw is a cowardly, lazy excuse for not wanting to wait on your customers!  When I made it a mile back to the bus station, my sandwich went into the garbage, it was frozen.",

The employees that were working at that time were extremely helpful and patient with all of us tourists in there at the time. I did not know that they were not famous for just one sandwich. They informed us that all of their sandwiches are made on fresh french bread and covered with provolone, fries, and vinegar based cole-slaw. We talked for a little while to the cook and he recommended the special, which was due to the Penguins winning the Stanley Cup. It was the HBK sandwich. Ham, Bacon, and Kielbasa sandwich. Everything was grilled on the flat top and smashed together in the sandwich. The portions are generous. The fries were nothing special and the slaw was crisp, but not super flavorful. The best part was the kielbasa and bread.",

While making a turn looking for a fudge place, I ran into Primanti Brother's.  Looking at the Yelp reviews, I happened to find the original.  It was meant to be = )    I parked, stepped outside in 37F weather, and a breeze of fried sweetness surrounded me.  Feels/looks like a pub, 24-hr, cash only spot, and known for their coleslaw and french fry stuffed sandwiches.  You can order as sides but why not try it the way they make it, right?  I ordered the corned beef and cheese - $6.29 (includes tax).  After a bite, I softly said, \"Oh...my...God\"  Yumminess!!  -Corned beef: maybe 5 thin slices with a small layer of swiss cheese.  Juicy but not too much.  Just enough salt.  Covers the entire span of the bread.  You can order double meat for $1.99.  I didn't need. -Fries: majorly fried, still soft, and sweetly seasoned.  About a handful is added to the meat and cheese.  Loved the sweet and salty combo.   -Coleslaw:  prepared peppery and vinegary (my faves).  Adds tang to my sandwich...me likes much!  I don't like my coleslaw mayoey (sp?) or creamy ; P.  It also adds bite to the sandwich especially since the 1 inch bread is un-toasted, therefore soft.    The place is lively with locals.  Staff is friendly and checks in on you while on the go, all the time.  I respect.    Eat there.  I wouldn't recommend ordering To-Go because the weight and moistness of the goodies flattens/softens the bottom piece of bread quickly.  Even then, the sandwich sits well over 3 inches.  Grub grub grub and enjoy with a sweet tea or a beer.  I'm saving my beer tasting for another place I visited last year.  Review to come soon.  Must go...people are standing at the door waiting for customers to leave.  I can understand their pain; hunger pain that is.",

I got the angus steak sirloin Primanti sandwich that was assembled by one guy using his bare hands as follows: white bread, beef, one slice of American (?) cheese, a handful of fries, a handful of cole slaw, one slice of tomato, white bread.  It was a tasty sandwich indeed, but seeing the how greasy and sloppy the guy made our sandwiches, I'd probably end up having a heart attack or food poisoning if I eat more of those sandwiches.  My friend got the regular cheesesteak, and that \"steak\" looked more like a mushed-up patty and didn't look so appetizing to eat.  Been there, done that.  No need to go for it again.",

However it is Pittsburgh history and it definitely a large tourist trap, I can also why people go to the other locations to catch a game and have a beer.

Even when I was drunk as hell, I found that a hot, fresh sausage sandwich right off the grill from one of the street vendors was much more satisfying than one of Primanti Bros' greasy, flavorless subs.  If you want to eat at a famous Pittsburgh institution, go get a hot dog and fries at The Original. Granted, you might get shot, but, hey, it's worth the risk.",

I had the cheesesteak which is uniquely adorned with fried and coleslaw to become a \"Pittsburger\". The sandwich itself isn't all that exciting, but it is good, and it's grilled up right in front of you. My buddy had the ragin' cajun chicken sandwich which was not as spicy as advertised, but he did report that it was good.  Wash it down with a Yuengling, and life is good.   It's ain't fancy, the service could hardly be called friendly, but it's one of those local joints you really have to see and taste for yourself.",

    "text": "primantis is not for everyone. ill admit that its not this fantastical godsend some people make it out to be. its a big greasy sandwich with a unique combination of ingredients that can be hit or miss depending on your personal tastes and how you order it.  why do i love primantis so much, then? because it is the hearts and soul of pittsburgh manifested in the form of a loaded sandwich. if you are from pittsburgh, even if you dont particularly like the sandwiches, primantis probably means something to you. its another point of pride for the city (or its sons and daughters) to rally around. just like the steelers, or the pens, or the goofy accents. its part of what makes pittsburgh unique and wonderful.  whenever i go home to visit, it has become a sort of ritual for me to get one. i do this because i cant get it anywhere else, its a distinct piece of home. i think i actually go to primantis more now than i did when i lived in pittsburgh.   as far as my personal preferences, i like to go with either the corned beef or the pastrami with hot sauce and ketchup and if im feeling sassy ill get a fried egg on it.  the local favorite is the cheese steak, however i dont really find it that great. last time i got it i had the worst farts ever, i cant verify whether or not they were the sandwichs fault. if you would like to try the cheese steak anyway, i would like to warn you that its not what you typically think of when you hear \"cheese steak.\" its more comparable to a hamburger patty that a regular cheese steak.   lastly, i want to make note of the fact that primantis is open 24 hours. this is great because primantis is the perfect drunk food. after all the bars close at 2 and you are wandering around the strip or southside, all boozed up with the munchies you can always rely on primantis to be there for you. and when this moment happens and you eat that sandwich, in your hungry inebriated state, it will be the most delicious food you have ever tasted.  i recommend primantis to anyone visiting pittsburgh, youre not going to get anything like it anywhere else and it will help you feel the full effect of the town. if you live there you should probably be eating one right now.",

If I am going to order them (which is what, once a month maybe?) I want them on the side.  And if the guy is going to bother deep fat frying them, the least he can do is let them sit there long enough to cook rather than just giving them a fat dip.  And draining them would be nice too!!    The bread was cut from what appeared to be an Italian loaf but it was all crumbly... and after fries (strike that: grease laden uncooked potatoes) were added it was saturated with oil.  There's no lettuce, no tomato, no semblance of anything remotely edible on the once wax paper, now grease dripping mess, that is thrust at you.    I'm sorry but this is just gross and inedible.  I could just about feel my arteries clog!",

I convinced my friends to walk to this place from our hotel which was a mile away. We got there at about 6 pm and there was no seating except for the bar. Lots of people and there was no way we could wait. We had not eaten since the morning and got lots of food. I got the pittsburger and some extra fries. I enjoyed every bite of it. My friends ordered more fries to my surprise. In no time, we were full but still wanted more. Ever sandwich comes with coleslaw, fries and tomatoes. They have lots of variations but at all times these sandwiches are stacked.   Pros: Great food, get extra fries along with the sandwich! Great service Customers and locals were all friendly at this place  Cons: Chance you might have to wait but it is so worth it",

So we spontaneously map the drive to Pittsburgh cause we're just wingin' this shit.  Drove 2 1/2 hours and wow were we disappointed!  I know, we sort of set ourselves up for disappointment by driving over a hour with lofty expectations but oh well...we do what we do.  How can you go wrong with pastrami, coleslaw, fries on Italian bread?!  The entire thing needed more flavor...some au jus maybe, some salt maybe?    On TV it looked like salt punch from the pastrami or corned beef, the starch and salt from the natural cut fries and Italian bread is the pinnacle of bread (for me) would be a perfect marriage but come to find out it's just a standard marriage with room for improvement (not ours dear).  I wanted to LOVE this place so much...hopefully it gets better.  All in all a great place to stop by for the nostalgia and what not but don't get your hopes and expectations in the way.",

However, I don't really want to focus too much on the food aspect in this review - service is the main point.   We visited on a Friday night around 10:30 and the place had a decent crowd and looked to only have one server. She came to our table and didn't even bother to say \"hi\" - just a \"What do you guys want.\" Thankfully I was a little tipsy from the Pirate game and sort of ignored her lack of customer service. When our food came she was still very rushed and didn't say anything to us. My boyfriend finally had to pin her down after waiting for our check for nearly 15 minutes to pay. She was extremely rude and asked him where the bill was. When he told her we didn't have it yet she said responded by pretty much saying she's not a mind reader and she had no clue what we had. Rude! What the heck is wrong with you? I worked in a restaurant before and have had a full dining room to myself- I know how stressful it can be, however it is never okay to be so blatantly rude to customers.   I'm giving this location three stars solely on food. My chicken sandwich was great and a great value for how big the sandwich was. I wasn't prepared by how spicy the chicken was going to be, but I was totally cool with it! Me love spicy foods!   Soooo bottom line, this place was only bearable because I was drunk and hungry. If I was ever craving a Primanti's while sober in the area, I'll get it go to.",

    "text": "We visited this location twice during our stay in the P'burgh.    Primanti's is a classic experience here, from what I'm told, but I'll be honest - I'd never heard of it before Adam Richman decided that he was going to shove an entire sandwich down his gullet here.  But the idea of a huge sandwich with a bunch of fries and cole slaw shoved in the middle sounded pretty good - so we stopped.  You have to order your sandwich from the huge board that they have (if you're in the back section - if you're at the counter, it's located over the grills) - there's no \"menu\" here, per se.  I think that this is all they do - sandwiches and nothing more.  Don't come in expecting a huge variety of dishes.    The first time we came, we dined in and were seated in the back.  I ordered a cappicola and egg sandwich, since this is what A.R. used as an example and he'd proclaimed it \"delicious\".  Well, it was definitely good, I will say that much - but I wish that the egg had been just a little \"runnier\" in the middle.  I like hard-cooked yolks as a rule, but in this case, a softer yolk would have made the dish.  Also, the sandwich was not nearly as big as it looked on television - I ate it and was like, \"Uh... still kind of hungry over here.\"  Kind of shocked, to be honest.    They bring these to you on wax paper - no plates.  I was a little taken aback by that at first, but I got used to it.  Neat, actually.  The cole slaw is absolutely delicious.  I wish I had the recipe, because I'd make it at home all the time.  Fries were hot and added a nice touch to the sandwich - not bad at all.  The second time we came in was when we were literally on our way home - we stopped here before hitting the freeway.  This time I got a \"colossal fish\" - and ate it warmed up at home a few hours later.  Honestly, I think that the colossal fish was MUCH better - that sandwich was a monster size and I had trouble finishing it.  Again, the fries and cole slaw added to the texture and taste experience.  I'd probably recommend this over the cappicola version.  It was even great microwaved at home hours later, believe it or not.  My second sandwich was also made by Ms. Toni herself (the woman that Adam Richman interviewed), so I don't know if that had anything to do with how much better it tasted.  I bet it did, though!  Service is a little lacking, but not enough for me not to come back.    Good stuff, and we'll be back to try other versions of the sandwich.    Worth a stop if you're visiting the Pittsburgh area.",

My trip to Primanti Brothers kicked off my first visit to Pittsburgh to see a Steelers game.  Having seen the shop on multiple TV shows and hearing all about it from my \"Yinzer\" friends, I had to try it.  It is as advertised, big, delicious, and not in the slightest bit healthy, which is just fine.  I loved the simplicity of my salami sandwich with cole slaw and french fries, it was just what I wanted and nothing I needed, and I loved it.   Fine dining it is not, but if you want that, you picked the wrong crowd.  Every single return trip to the Steel City (and I plan many) will include a visit to Primanti Brothers.  The atmosphere was lively (even though it was packed the night before a Steelers game), the service was friendly and prompt, and the food was delicious.  Keep this up, Primantis, you got something good going, although something tells me you already know that.",

Took the hotel shuttle down to the restaurant and sat in the back of the left side dinning room. What a fun and nostalgic place, that has a lot of character. After we finished we walked back to the Hotel ( Residence Inn Marroit ) next to PNC Park where we watched the Pirates beat the Nats. Great game! Took us about 25 minutes to walk it and got to see a bit of the city, crossed the Andy Whorl bridge taking photos along the way. Great sandwiches and very nice people working at Primantis",

Even the chili cheese fries were bland.  I did like their bread and the beer was cold. Overall, a ho-hum experience.  Next time, we'll go to Peppi's.",

Whisked to the bar on the opposite side, I missed seeing the grill as I ate.  Yes! Pastrami with french fries smashed in between, chili cheese fries, and a beverage (this was my only meal for the day).  Pastrami - I wish they let me order the pastrami without the fries. Fries in this sandwich takes away from the pastrami. Meat was lean, bread a little too soft and not as durable as I worked my way through the it.   Chili Cheese fries - At first, waitress wouldn't let me order it \"Honey, sandwich so big, you don't need the chili cheese fries.\" So after I showed I'm a big boy and can handle the pastrami, she let me order the fries.  Customer Service - They are so busy so there were periods where no one checked on me while I was desperate for a refill on my beverage. There was an older gentleman who was either an owner or previous general manager who kept making comments about the food, helping take drink orders, and was just a good spirit to have at the bar to entertain us.",

    "text": "I've visited a number of Primanti Brothers locations and am a fan of their food. The service at this location, however, was awful. When we walked in the manager attempted to seat us even though there was a perfectly capable hostess standing right there. He took us into the dining area, asked us to wait in an awkward location and then disappeared. He never wrote our name or party number down at the hostess station or even bothered to tell her that we would need seated. We waited there for about 20 minutes, and a few other parties who seemed to have just walked in were seated ahead of us. At one point the manager even walked up to us again and asked if we needed a table. I honestly believe that in his mind this was the first time he had ever interacted with us.  After grabbing the hostess and explaining the situation, we were seated pretty quickly. Sadly that was not the end of our troubles. Our waiter was very obnoxious and more interested in hearing himself talk than actually listening to anyone. I got the impression that he was trying to imitate a tough-guy New York deli owner you might see on TV. A number of people asked for their coleslaw on the side because, frankly, it's gross. Each time he challenged the person, claiming that they must not have eaten here before and that we didn't know what we were doing and that \"that's just how we do it here in Pittsburgh\" (Just for the record we were all born and raised in Pittsburgh and have eaten at Primanti Brothers countless times). I think he thought he was being charming like those beloved caricatures he was clearly imitating from TV, but it was really just annoying.  I like Primantis a lot, and it was nice to visit the original location, but I think that status of \"first\" may have gone to their head. I would definitely recumbent that you visit a different location. Additionally, the other locations I've visited have wider beer and mixed drinks selection and more items on the menu, so that's a plus.",

Once you're seated you're not given any menu since the menu is painted on the walls. Their menu is simple since it's pretty much just various kinds of sandwich fillings (fish, meat, etc.).   The concept is pretty interesting as well, since they stuff the coleslaw, cheese, tomato, fries, and your choice of meat in between their bread. The portion is just nice, leaving you not too full and not too underfed.   Would definitely stop by if I were in Pittsburgh again. Remember to bring cash.",

I'm originally from Erie, but have many wonderful memories involving PB, mostly from my early college years.  Most recently was here with two Pittsburgh natives and my boyfriend in November 2011.  No wait to be seated, but the dining area was extremely busy.  It was a Friday afternoon and a mixed, lively crowd.  The food was just as expected - a filling, overflowing sandwich pile that paired perfectly with a Yuengling.  I had the corned beef and cheese, btw.  The bread is cheap.  It gets soggy and if you are not a quick eater, the sandwich will fall apart.  Native Pennsylvanians eat like cavemen anyway, so it's generally not a problem.  Factor in a VERY low-key atmosphere, a very Eastern-European waitress, and a whole crowd just happy to be around one another and you should have a great time.  I almost prefer to visit during busy periods because this has always been my experience.  Boyfriend was genuinely charmed by the place.  He eats too quickly to form any worthwhile opinion on the quality of his dish, but he did enjoy dismissing all the rules of his traditional, well-mannered Southern upbringing.  He got to play with his food.  He could stare at the funny, bumbling half-drunks traipsing throughout the place.    And now, he wants to put french fries on every sandwich he makes.  Thank you, Primanti Brothers.",

The resteraunt was neat and seemed to have a unique feel to it, but when we got our food it was sub par at best. I chose to get the #2 best seller the pittsburger cheese steak. The bread was regular white texas toast not toasted or anything special. The burger patties were just a frozen patty, again nothing special. The big deal seemed to be that they put fries on the sandwich, which was okay but didn't seem to add anything to the meal. In my opinion this would have been pretty cool (and probably would have tasted a lot better) with fresh meat and Texas TOAST. The price is good, my meal was about $8, but if I had to do it again I would have gone some where else to experience the city.",

Although I enjoyed it, I doubt I'll ever take an hr trip from Ohio to it again.  I actually like the decor unlike other Yelpers. I had no idea about all the people who represented Pittsburgh but I left way more aware.  The bathrooms location is crazy, but its all part of the this place is weird type of thing.

The cole slaw gave a nice crunch and off set the greasiness of the fries.  I could see this as a great post-drinking meal.  I ended up coming back the morning I was headed back to NY and tried the ham version of what I originally ordered.  Definitely didn't have the same kick as the pastrami.

On a Wednesday morning at 11 there was a lunch crowd streaming in, but no wait at all, and our waitress was nice as can be. She yelled at the TV a couple of times, which made me feel instantly akin.   So, as I have lived in three cities with famous foodstuffs, I am naturally prone to raising a skeptical eyebrow, to beware of claims of the second-coming in sandwich form. And besides that, to put it plain, I didn't like the looks of the bread. Appeared  to be a thick width-cut of soft Italian bread. While fresh, the bread slices were just as I had figured.   Those slices had all the power of Wonder Bread when it came to holding that sandwich together. Come on bread, where's ya integrity? Where's ya pride?! The sandwich fries, though hand-cut-looking, were unseasoned and mostly flabby. I'm tellin you, if the fries were fried to crispy salty perfection, I'd be singin a lot different tune here... a tune that might go something like, \"Ooooh you're bread's too soft, but everything else is awright...\" or something like that. I'm not really a song-writer.   The coleslaw didn't offend me! The pastrami was the best part of the whole t'do. My travelin' pal had the sandwich with \"kolbassi,\" and he agreed that the meatsy was the highlight of the sandwich too.   So, I just wanted to taste for myself. Good to know that Primanti Brothers is open 24 hours. While I don't ever see me on a line stretched round the back, I can see the appeal at 3:07 AM or some such situation.",

I first learned about Primanti's while watching a show on the Food Network that highlighted famous food joints around the country.   While I was visiting a friend in Pittsburgh a few years back, we made the trip to Primanti's. Due to their huge popularity in Pittsburgh, they now have multiple locations, they're even in PNC Park. We made sure to go to the original Primanti's.   Nothing really complicated here. They serve basically sandwiches, but with a twist. Rather than have your fries, coleslaw and sandwich separate, they bring it all together within the sandwich.   Naturally, you don't need to order of wings or onion rings with your sandwich. One sandwich will fill you up. Despite the fact tourists frequent the place, Primanti's has the feel of a neighborhood hangout.   The waiter service was great. The wait for our sandwiches wasn't too long. They have beer on tap, mostly domestic.   The pastrami sandwich I ordered did not disappoint. Not too fatty. The bread was just right. If I visit Pittsburgh again, I am going to make another stop at Primanti's.",

The food was good and unique, and the Black Angus Sirloin Strip Sandwich was quite large. Unfortunately, we had a really bad experience with service that was pushy, impatient and unhelpful. The server seemed completely uninterested in helping us. We could have walked out without even being noticed, but instead, we had to grab the server's attention just to pay our bill. Don't let this dissuade you from trying it out and drawing your own conclusion.",

I had the capicolla with cheese, and the requisite fries and cole slaw on the sandwich. The fries were pretty soggy and I ended up taking most of them off just so I could manage to eat the sandwich without it falling apart. Our friend the PA hometown boy had fun showing us the ropes. You stand in line at a chaotic counter, pick your sandwich, and you're on your way pretty quickly if you're carrying out (which we were.) There's table seating too but the servers were dealing with a post-last-call crowd and we didn't feel like waiting.   We ended up in the place after a night out and it's fun to see so many people hanging out and eating freakishly large sandwiches at 3 a.m. I'd do it again in a minute. I don't know if I'd be convinced to try the egg on it, but I'd go for a corned beef...Capicolla was yummy, though, and so was the bread.",

We sat at the counter and that was a fun to eat there.  We shared a Pastrami sandwich and I thought the meat portions were small, mostly cold slaw and fries in your sandwich.  The pastrami was average and I would have liked more of that then the other items.  It was a big sandwich and enough for us.  We didn't have to order any fries, but we forgot it was in the sandwich.  The fries could be crisper and I thought they were tasty, but too soft for me.  Overall, I say go there once to experience it.  There's not a lot of attention from the staff, bc the place is so busy.  I don't need to go back.   If you miss getting a chance to eat there.....then catch it the next time you visit, not a must to visit.",

I've also visited the Cranberry location several times over the last few years while visiting the in-laws.  Good - but not the same as the Strip.  This time we visited over the Veteran's Day holiday.  Peak lunch time on a Friday afternoon. A bit hard to find (since we hadn't been there in 20yrs) and parking was a bit of a nightmare.  But it worked out.  The place is larger than I remembered.  We sat in the dining room to the left of the entrance.  I don't remember that being there in the 80's. Food was excellent.  Love the fries!  Love the sandwich with fries & slaw.  Highly recommend checking out this location.",

    "text": "My initial introduction to Primanti's began about a year ago with everyone insisting, \"You have to go to primanti's! They make these amazing sandwiches piled with french fries and cole slaw. It's a Pittsburgh institution!!\"  Well, to be honest, they said the one thing that will keep me miles away from any peice of food - cole slaw or more particularly a cabbage product. Trust me, if I don't want to be around myself when cabbage is in my stomach, no one else does.  My actual first visit to Primanti's was just last week. After spending a night out with the guys, we decided we needed some grub. We were at Smallville's, only a few doors down from the strip district Primanti's which I believe is the original. The bars had just closed. The streets were littered with the scantily clad and utterly drunk. I was neither drunk nor scantily clad!  The place was packed with a ring side view of a man sweating over a hot grill and smushing fries and coleslaw with his hands onto said sandwich. And then another guy smushing and cutting the pile of intestine turning \"staples\" and handing them across the bar to the awaiting group.   This is not the place for the timid. While not typically timid, my mindset viewed Primanti's (at 2:00 am when swamped with drunken masses) as a sort of \"soup-nazi\" mentality on ordering. While my friends insisted I could order a sandwich sans-cole slaw - something about the whole grilling, smushing, and well...smushing really. . .just did not intice me. And beyond that, I fears a random riot or glare of disgruntlement from the cook who was indeed \"on a roll\" with his quickly produced orders. When we ordered there were over 10 orders on the grill that were completed (WITH COLE SLAW) while we waited in line. The numbers were not letting up, people were coming in behind us...  On the other hand, they did have chili fries on the menu. Never one to turn down chili fries, I gave my friend some money and stood back while he went to order.  He was told he can only order french fries on the other side of the store (the bar side which was packed with drinkers and diners). He goes over there, to the bartender he knows no less, and was summarily told that there were three people ahead of us for chili fry orders. . .in the \"don't bother\" mentality. They wouldn't take his order or his money essentially. Honestly, I was sober, I could have waited but at the same time - if the state of the front grill was telling - I didn't want to know why making an order of chili fries in the back may be too time consuming for me to bother. Bucket of chili, fries, smush smush...how hard can THAT be.  So while I can see Primanti's for its historical/regional value (and I am sure if sampled drunk. . .no wait. . .my stomach just isn't that strong. . .), it's definitely not for the weak of heart or stomach. On par with the cheese steak legions in Philadelphia, its definitely worth experiencing.  And everyone who could stomach it (primarily men, I believe I was outnumbered almost 1 to 7 there) live and die by this food. So for that reason, I give a rather nuetral 3 stars...I would definitely take someone there, but I am not sure I will ever eat anything myself.",

As a Texan, I have never had the chance to experience the magnitude of their sandwiches until recently. Walking into the restaurant down in the infamous \"warehouse district\" in Pittsburgh, Primanti Brothers resembled the blue-collar sandwich shop that I had imagined.   Full of tourists and local workers, I knew this place was legit. I was sipping on a Steel City cold beer trying to decide what sandwich to order. I decided to ask the waiter what the most popular item was... \"You're drinking it,\" he responded. This place was awesome. I got the corned beef and cheese. Piled high with coleslaw, french fries, corned beef, and cheese, it was a sure accomplishment to finish it whole. Served on simple butcher paper, Primanti Brothers keeps their style and their sandwiches simple, yet satisfying.   This is not a restaurant that I would eat at three times a week, but definitely a place I will start stopping at when I am in town. The only exception would be after a night of drinking, then I would become a regular.",

And what amazed me was that the sandwich stayed intact after taking the bite, no debris has fallen off.  It's definitely a combo meal in one hand!
