I went there for dinner on the 4th of July with my husband and mother-in-law. The food was pretty mediocre. The decor seemed cheap (also keep in mind that it's located in a hotel). Our server was rushing us the whole time, serving our dinner while we were still eating our appetizers, asking if we wanted dessert menus when we were still eating our entrees... She was very nice, but in too much of a hurry, and she also forgot the beer my husband ordered. Would not go back here.",

    "text": "I travel a LOT, and I can probably count the number of amazing hotel restaurants I have found on one hand. This place just bumped someone off the list. WOW.  This is a totally upscale version of Pittsburgh classic fare. Don't be misled by all of the negative complaints - they sound like nice, blue collar folk. But dinner here is definitely not blue collar. For one, the menu is the way it's supposed to be - chosen by the chef based on what is in season and at the peak of flavor. Everything is local, and to a foodie, that is a beacon of quality. And the creativity the chef uses in building out the menu is worthy of the Food Network.  I had some spicy tomato bisque tonight that was just out of this world. Then I went with the chef's own sausage and cheese creation. Classic for Pittsburgh, right? Except the quality was WAY above expectations and just filled my palate with delicious complexity. I am already planning on coming back tomorrow night.  If you want a simpler, cheaper meal - head over to the nearby Primanti's. If you want to savor every bite and challenge what you think you already know about food, get to the Bigelow Grille now. It's that good.",

    "text": "I'm gonna go along with what Ryan has to say about this place.  I'm also wary of hotel restaurants because they vary so greatly in quality and they tend to be a little pricey.  Besides, a hotel bar-and-grill is one of the least likely places you'd expect a sister-and-brother to dine at.    My brother Paul and I ended up eating dinner here last night before going over to the Civic* Arena for the Roger Daltry/Eric Clapton concert.  Our original plan had been to meet at Chinatown Inn.  Indeed, I had my heart and palate set on good Chinese food.  But with the winter weather we decided to eat at a place a little closer to the Arena.  The food here wasn't bad, but holy macaroni!  $12.00 for my cheeseburger?  $15.00 for my brother's steak sandwich?  Good thing we ordered off the bar menu, 'cos we weren't planning on spending $35.00 per person for dinner.  We're not cheap or anything, but niether one of us budgeted close to $90.00 for the two of us after tax and tip!    But it's alright in a pinch and I guess they cater to travel-weary hotel guests.  *Yes I still call it the Civic Arena.",

The waitress was new but very outgoing and knowledgable - she was clearly well trained. There is no discernible theme to the place and this was made obvious by the curious choice of music which was some sort of emo genre played way too loud. It was out of character for a dinner restaurant and was terribly distracting. But, if you are staying at the Doubletree and are looking for a decent meal, a good beer and friendly and staff, this place fits the bill. Just bring some earphones!",

    "text": "I am staying at the DoubleTree now, but a few months ago had read about the Bigelow Grille.  I like to eat at restaurants that prioritize local fare.  I flew into Pittsburgh and got to the hotel after 8pm.  The restaurant is open until 11pm.  I was excited to put my stuff away and come down.  It was not crowded at all.  I should have sat at the bar, but was swayed into a booth, by myself.    I don't mind eating by myself, but when my server is more interested in the family with several young, audible children, instead of me, I get a little annoyed.  They start with bread and this tomato-ish dip (which was delicious).  I ordered the roasted cauliflower, which was also delicious.  I asked the server which was better - the fish and chips, or the burger.  She suggested the fish and chips.  I went with it, but wondered if it really took 20 minutes after getting my cauliflower to receive my entre.    It was heavily breaded and the batter greasy.  I could scoop the fish out of the middle.  I do prefer my fish to be lightly breaded and easily eaten.  I left all the breading in my bowl.  The fish was also placed on top of potato wedges - which the server really raved about - but they were also greasy from the fish.  I didn't finish that.  Still hungry, I would have ordered dessert, however, I was made to wait another 20 minutes after obviously finishing my meal before I could get my check.  And then made to wait again.    So, 2 stars for mediocre fish and chips and bad service.  (however, they do use locally sourced food, so I'm a little torn about leaving it at 2)",

I had a pretty skimpy cob salad (had you gone a little heavier on the avocado, this would be a four star review...) and Todd had the burger.   Guess what? Order a medium, you'll get a medium-well (but more like well done) burger.  It was decent in our pinch but I'm not trying to go there again- gratuity was added and it was a little 'spensive.   Meh.",

I found Bigelow Grille online, and their website indicated they would have a Christmas Day Dinner, but the description only said \"Join us for Christmas Day Dinner 12pm to 7pm. Featuring seasonal offerings.\" I made a reservation on OpenTable anyway, and called to ask if they would be able to accommodate a vegan (my husband and his brother are omnivores). The girl who answered took my number and said a manager would call me the next morning. I never heard from them, so I called again three days later. Same story, and I still never heard. It is now Christmas Eve, and their website still has the same vague description, and I've never gotten a call. Needless to say, I booked elsewhere.  This may be the greatest restaurant on earth, but they are totally unconcerned with their customers. I'm glad I don't live in Pittsburgh (for many reasons!).",

    "text": "I'm always a little bit wary of hotel restaurants--they seem to vary so wildly in quality but tend to be less than stellar on balance.  I found Bigelow Grille on OpenTable, though, and so I made a reservation as an out-of-towner--I didn't need the reservation, though, as the place was almost totally empty at 8 PM on a Thursday.  The service was OK--the waiter seemed to be busy setting up other tables for customers that never arrived--but he also didn't seem to be too familiar with the wine list and looked confused when I asked him basic questions about the menu.  The food was decently priced.  My bill, including appetizer, wine, main course, coffee and tip was exactly $50.  However, the food was only OK.  The pan-seared calamari resembled pasta and was served with mushrooms that were a bit flaccid as well as a few undressed lettuce leaves inexplicably on the side.  The pork tenderloin was most definitely not served medium rare as I asked, but it still tasted good--it was flavorful enough but the whole dish was a bit one-note.  The food really struck me as more along the lines of what a good home cook (not an expertly trained chef) would turn out in a restaurant environment.  I don't want to pan the place entirely, as the prices are reasonable and the service is friendly... just don't expect to be jolted by the food.",

On Saturday after checking in we planned on heading directly to Market Square but got trapped in the hotel for a few hours as heavy thunderstorms hit the area.  No worries, we decided to go have some beers at the Bigelow Grille hotel bar and grab some bar food while we waiting for better weather.  First off no complaints on the food.  It was actually really good and reasonably priced.  We shared a cheese & fruit tray, bowl of wonderful tomato bisque and the mac and cheese skillet.  The problem we had was with our server (Holly).  We commented on what a great selection of music was being played.  She explained it was Pandora radio and how they go back and forth on how to select what is played depending on who's on duty.  We complimented her on the food, talked about the weather and she seemed really nice.  Next thing we hear is her talking to her co workers (and manager) making fun of us within earshot.  We weren't being weird, we were not drunk and were just hanging out at a small table by the bar enjoying ourselves.  After paying our (with tip) $88 tab the least you could have done was waited till we left to talk behind our backs.  I'm not sure what we did to her but I just want to let whoever reads this know, it really hurt my wife's feelings and put a damper on our evening when we did get out on the town...",

The menu has changed. We had light fare, soup, salad, etc. I can say it was good, although the grilled cheese was just that: a hunk of gouda, grilled with crostini. Good but a bit disconcerting when you were expecting a sandwich. I had the bolognese with pappardelle and it was very good. Would I go here if I wasn't staying at the hotel and this wasn't a convenient, easy place to eat on a cold, rainy, windy evening? No. I think they are trying too hard to make this something that it can't be. It feels pretentious. They'll never attract people from outside the hotel to this restaurant given the location. What the hotel needs is a good bar that serves good bar food and downhome Pittsburgh basics. How about some perogies and keilbasa? I think they'd pack the place.",

    "text": "I had lunch here last week mainly because of its convenient location.  Tom and I are considering leasing some office space in the building and thought we needed to gather all the information neccessary to make an informed decision (local bar and restaurant obviously having a solid influence).  I wasn't too excited to have lunch here I had wanted to try it years ago when Kevin Sousa gained local and some national attention for his alchemy menu, however that was several restaurants ago for Kevin and I believe he is now at Nine on Nine.  Anyways, we got there at about 1145 I think on Thursday.  The waitress came over and took our drink orders and then left us alone for a little too long... about 20 minutes however she probably thought we were busy since there was blueprints everywhere.  She finally came over and was friendly enough and took our order.   The space itself is minimalist with earth tone colors and a well stocked bar in the back.  It has hardwood floors plenty of sunlight and in general is a very adequate space and it's good there is a seperate entrance on the side to get to the restaurant without having to walk through the hotel lobby.  We started with some cold bread and cold oil of some type, kind of meh'.  Again, I wasn't expecting too much from this hotel restaurant.  I started with a cup of there soup of the day which was a spicy black bean soup, that was surprisingly... well... delicious I'd say.  My only complaint is that it wasn't that spicy and was served only slightly warm, not pipin' hot how most soup should be.  I ordered the BLT that came with Pierogies as an option for a side instead of just regular fries or a veggie.  The Pierogies were really good served perfectly sauteed with good potato and cheese filling and perfectly caramalized onions and sour cream.  i was really happy with this side, not just because it was an option as a side, but because it was executed perfectly.  My BLT was also really good.  It wasn't just normal or crispy bacon it was thick braised pork/bacon with a reallly delicious flavor served on really good quality sour dough bread with a nice slaw of some type instead of just lettuce.  The price was also good at $10 for the sandwich and sides.  It was a healthy portion. Speaking of prices I thought my cup of soup was a bit overpriced in comparison at $6 for the cup.  Tom had the \"Cheese Steak\", which wasn't steak at all but braised short ribs served wtih good quality amish chedder.  The fact that these folks put such care into the lunch menu makes me want to go back for Dinner.  I was pretty impressed and pleasantly surprised by this lunch spot and may be another check in the plus column in influencing to add space in this area.  I probably should give this place four stars, but I've been told recently that I'm too generous with the stars so maybe I'm a bit self conscious.  In either case I'll be back.",

There was an omelet bar in addition to the usual breakfast buffet of eggs, bacon, pancakes, sausage, potatoes, French toast and fruits. The problem was in the half hour we were there, there was no chef at the omelet bar. We wondered if it was self serve omelets. I went to the buffet twice and in that time, no chef. I stood there at the omelet station for a while before my first trip to the buffet and nothing. No staff to tel me \"it will be one minute, I'll send him out\". As I'm paying the check, low and behold, the chef shows up. Very poor experience!",

I had the fortune of enjoying all of my breakfasts for free with a coupon voucher given to my group as a compliment. The buffet is full. Fresh, and yes I mean fresh cut fruits and all in separate bins which allows for the enjoyment of either one or all of them. The eggs are carton type and are served with or without cheese. There is an array of cereals to choose from and milks. On the mornings that I had breakfast here they had an omelette bar with a lurky looking individual cooking them. Well.... The omelette that I have had have all come out as a neat pile of scrambled eggs and whatever I chose to have with them. The seating and lighting are perfectly quaint. Overall......

She apologized and offered to bring him out a new plate of food, but he did not want to wait for the food to be cooked, so he just tilted the plate so that the water would fall off.

The only reason it gets two stars is for how good the spicy tomato soup was. I'd rather have a large bowl of that than order the burger. The burger was below average - no toppings other than cheese and a slice of tomato.  I ordered the burger medium rare and I received a well done burger. It was pretty thin and not juicy.  My side salad was missing the dressing I ordered.  Needless to say, I'll be going elsewhere for my dinners.",

The staff at the BG is extremely nice and accommodating, whenever their schedule allows we get the table in the nook area where we can have our meeting while eating and not disturbing the rest of the restaurant which to a certain degree gives the meeting a higher degree of business atmosphere.  Having tried several of their dishes I can say that their most recent menu revisions address a lot of the concerns I have read in past reviews.  Portion sizes are very generous (the exception being their seafood offerings) and their quality of cooking is quite good.  In the last couple of months I have tried:    - Bigelow Burger    - Jumbo Sandwhich    - Artesan Grilled Cheese with Tomato Soup    - Crunchy Tilapia Tacos    - Chicken Panini     - Several Desserts  All of the dishes above met or exceeded my expectations.  The pricing fluctuates from the affordable (Grilled Cheese & Soup) to the extravagant (seafood dishes).  Be advised that some of their deserts infuse a lot of flavors that to the inexperienced palate will come as a shock.  Granted with the aforementioned revisions they've also toned down the infusions theme in the desserts.  I can certainly see myself taking friends to the BG, and definitely continuing our meetings as long as their staff and management will have us.",

They market themselves as a local organic kitchen and bar but they fail to meet my expectations and I don't expect much from hotel restaurants.First meal chicken was dry salad was okay but swimming in dressing, next meal butter lettuce salad was decent, meatballs were good but the polenta was runny, tonight the chicken sandwich was tasteless except for the grease and the gnocchi tasted okay but was tough.

We arrived a few minutes after 6 PM and the kindest thing I can say about the restaurant is that they honored the reservation and promptly seated us. After stopping by the table to introduce herself and take our drink order, the next time we saw our server was an hour and ten minutes later.    I had ordered their signature burger medium rare and had a detailed discussion with the server asking that she delete the various pickled onions, pickles and cheese from the burger. Our food came out approx 80 minutes later, over cooked, cold and grey, and smothered in onions and the other pickled glop that I had asked be deleted. When I was able to flag down our server she never apologized, her only comment was \"Well, I told them you didn't want any onions\" as she scurried off with my plate to the kitchen.  Fifteen minutes later another burger arrived, this time warm and grey, again badly overcooked, but at least without the pickled glop du jour. I waited another few minutes while they went in search of a clean fork since mine disappeared with the first kitchen return.  In summary: horrible and inept service coupled with twice delivered inedible food.  The DoubleTree should be embarrassed. This restaurant is a disgrace.",

I settled on ribeye and asked the waitress what medium rare meant at this restaurant but she didn't know how to describe it.  She is really nice.  I described it as cooked, but at the very center, it's just short or raw.  What I got was a browned raw steak.  They described the potatoes as Rosemary fries. What they were was potato wedges not fries in any way.  They seemed baked, not fried.  This meal was a very expensive disaster and I now have to find a place to eat tomorrow.

Bigelow Grille prides itself on being a local and organic kitchen and bar, and I have to say, they know their stuff when it comes to their food. Their presentation and set-up, though...it leaves room for improvement.  Before getting to the food menu I naturally looked over a wine menu and was disappointed by my limited options. If you only order a glass rather than a bottle, you can only pick from about 5 options instead of 20 or so. Sadly the drink I really wanted was only available as a bottle...also, I dealt with a very weird reaction when I got carded; the waitress said, \"Oh my gosh, you're a baby!\" Is this normal etiquette when talking to a young adult woman who works full time and has been out of school for a while? It wasn't outright offensive but it was very offputting. What was I supposed to say to that?  Well, fortunately the meal itself was actually pretty stupendous and made up for everything. The tomato bisque had a really good kick to it that even I, a hater of spicey foods, really enjoyed. The lamb burger I ordered was to die for - cooked perfectly, served with a side of greens and dressing, all in the perfect portions. Forget dessert - I'd come back just to try another burger or their gnocchi!  It's definitely been a long time since I ate such a fresh meal that left me satisfied, and I truly want to come back and enjoy another one. Now if only the weather wasn't getting colder...sadly, we must add another complaint regarding the place's layout: the restaurant has a long row of unlocked sliding doors right next to the dining tables. I guess if those doors don't lock during the winter, I'll have to postpone my next visit to the land of local organic goodness for the summer. The food may be good, but it's not good enough to shiver over!",

Choices were scramble eggs, with or without cheese, home fries, bacon, sausage links, oatmeal, various breads, some cold cereals and a little bit of fresh fruit. Eggs tasted different than my home area as well as the potatoes. The waitress was quick and friendly. Prices were fair. They are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Open early to late.

Made to order omelets, french toast, waffles, cut grapefruit, many many kinds of pastries, yogurt and granola. etc, etc, etc. So, to sum it up, a crap load of food!  So as mass amounts of food are produced, I feel that the quality of food goes down. The eggs were dry, the home fries weren't as crispy as they should be and the grapefruit, not so fresh. I did, however, enjoy the French Toast and pastries. They were both fresh and delicious. Ironic that the worst things for you were the best. Of course!

Getting there a bit after 10am, we were asked if we wanted the buffet.  Now I'm not a big fan of buffets, since everyone is touching the utensils and it's kind of gross, but the added fact that we would likely be some of the last people in for it made methink better of that option very quickly.  As we were seated the waitress asked if we wanted the buffet.  Again no.  She brings my coffee, no milk.  I ask for milk and she says \"1 sec\".  Well 5 minutes later I ask again.  5 minutes after that I finally have milk.  I got an omelet for breakfast.  It was so greasy, that it stayed with me all day.  It was just a bad, bad awful experience.",

Both were fresh, delicious and elegantly presented. (Check the pictures out).  They also started us off with some bread and 'tomato, oil' concoction for dipping. Yum!  The waitress, hostess and manager were all extremely friendly, polite, and willing to accommodate even asking if I'd like to make any substitutions to the salad without being prompted to do so. Our waitress could probably have used a little polishing. \"Are you done with the tomato stuff?\" or \"The Bean Fritters are fritters with beans in them\". But now I'm just being picky, she really was a great waitress overall.  I'd definitely return.",

    "text": "Just spent three nights at the Doubletree Hotel in Pittsburgh, where the Bigelow Grill is housed. We had dinner and breakfast there, and that was more than enough to send us out to find other dining establishments.   The Appetizers at our Group's Table (providing the only truly tasty items in our experience with the menu):  Roasted Brussel Sprouts - simple, tasty, and cooked to perfection; Spicy Tomato Bisque - as advertised, spicy and a good soup; Winter Squash - sweet, cooked well, and a satisfying level of sweet to complement the natural sweet of the squash; \"Artisan Cheese Plate\" - consisting of exactly three pieces of uninspiring cheese, four pieces of toasted bread, a bit of jam, and a fresh berry or two (this one was particularly disappointing at its $11 price)  Next, our Entre Selections (which left MUCH to be desired):  Duck - uninspired and strange flavor and texture combinations with a sweet rice and sweet paste beneath an unseasoned, undercooked duck; \"Gourmet\" Macaroni & Cheese with \"smoked chicken\" - elbow macaroni noodles with a small amount of, again unseasoned, cream, a hint of non-de script cheese, and a few chunks of chicken, the predominant impression being \"dry\"; Spanish Canelones - flavorless and dry as well; Lemon Risotto - the only bright spot in the entre selection tried at our table  Finally, our breakfast attempt the following morning: all I can say about the buffet is, Just Don't. Everything else off the menu was neither inspiring, nor awful...with the exception of the congealed lump of raisins that was passed off as \"craisins\" served with the mushy oatmeal.  Because there are not a lot of dining options within a few blocks of the Doubletree on the weekends, our group really wanted to like the Bigelow Grille. They get two stars for the servers, who were friendly and helpful. However, the quality of the menu hovers between uninspiring, just bland, and awful.  NOT recommended.",

A little pricey for breakfast, but the food and service was good despite being very busy.  Lunch was another story. I was eating alone and ordered a burger and a salad. There were only 2 or 3 other tables occupied at the time (11:45 am), however, my food did not arrive for 28 minutes! The burger was overlooked and tasted mediocre at best. The salad was pretty good and the wait staff was very polite, but overall the experience left a lot to be desired.",

    "text": "I read the Yelp reviews and saw that this place had two stars.  Having avoided Yelp two star review restaurants, I told myself to keep an open mind as the restaurant held themselves out as \"local organic kitchen and bar\" on the top of both their menu and website.    When a restaurant uses the words \"organic\" and  \"local\" in their title, this usually implies that the restaurant is using a farm to table concept. Not at this establishment!  The best that I can gather is that this restaurant used the terms very literally in using the word \"local\" to imply \"nearby to a hotel\" and \"organic\" to imply \"not made out of inorganic material such as steel\".    I did not see many organic items and the menu did not list the local source of ingredients.    The food quality was basic and somewhat overpriced.  $15 for a BLT made from \"pork belly\". The bun tasted like something one can get in a 6 pack from the grocery store for $2.99. The $15 pizza with \"rooftop herbs\" were actually just microgreens.  Seemed small for the price.    We were he only ones in the restaurant at 6pm which is always a telling sign that the locals know that this is not the place to be.    Draft beer list lacked creativity and had 6 IPAs and one blonde.  That's it.  Very limited selection.    If you respect yourself as a foodie or just someone who likes food, stay away from this restaurant.  I should have listened better to the negative Yelp reviews.",

We were greeted when we arrived, on time, and seated in a separate room.  It was as if we were put in a separate restaurant.  We were neglected.  It took the waitress 10-15 minutes to even acknowledge us.   She took both our drink and food orders together.  We waited.  Finally five dinners arrived.  She forgot the sixth dinner.  It arrived much later, after everyone else was done eating.  To the Grille's credit, they comped that meal. We asked for more water; it never came.   We waited for our checks then waited for them to be collected.  Finally we chased her down to pay.   On top of all this the food was just okay.",

Because it is in my hotel, and it is blustering cold outside and i am in a part of town that would require quite a hike to get to the action, i opted for dinner here.  Sadness.  Empty on a Friday night, sat at bar, which had a mildew odor.  What the heck the hotel is dated, and the bar was quite dark, give it a shot.  Not a bad offering of beers on tap so that is my thumbs up.  ordered a local Witte beer and it was good!  Downhill from here - spicy tomato bisque with the parm cheese out of the green can.  (no excuse for this, none).  It was super temperature hot and after i removed this \"cheese\" from the soup, it was ok, but not great. Next - the heirloom beet salad.  I was confused by what was in the salad and asked to see the menu again and had to read it a few times and i concur that what was in the salad was not what was on the menu.  The beets were good but the rest of this was awful. Based on the description - what must have been \"almond sesame crumble\" was stale and hard and too hard to even eat.  And no where in the description was spinach but there it was on my plate. The up side is that i was able to grab my beer and take it to my room, and walk next door to the adjoining 7-11 for a pack of hostess ding-dongs.  Yep.  i did it.",

All the food was decent Americana: fried chicken sandwich with bacon and tasty fries, scallops with grilled lettuce, savory duck, and rib eye with Brussels slaw. The cocktails looked tempting, but we didn't partake that night.  Note bene to anyone with mobility, bladder, or bowel issues, there is no restroom in the restaurant itself. It is across the restaurant lobby (no stairs, just ramps).",

The Pierogis were cooked to perfection with a dash of sour cream.   * Mac & Cheese was yummy. It came with fried tomatoes, bacon bits and bread crumbs. Tasty!   * Bigelow Burger with Pierogis was delicious. Can't go wrong with a burger.   Overall we enjoyed our meal. The service was ok. Oh and don't forget to ask about the specials!

The meat did not seem like it was fresh ground, which at the price they charge for the burger it should be.  It just seemed to uniform and did not have a fresh flavor.  The burger was cooked properly which I appreciated, however it was just an average burger.  I have also had the lamb burger before which was better than the Bigelow burger.  It had a very unique taste.  The best dish I have ever had here is the Mac and cheese.  It has a great flavor to it and is filling!",

I was not impressed with their foods. However the wine was good. They have buffet breakfast everyday. The food okay, mostly very salty. It must be Pittsburgh thing because we have eaten five different places they seem to be a trend. Anyways, after two mornings of eating at the buffet, we learned that we could order custom cooked omelette. We tried the prepared menu order the next morning they were still very salty. We gave it another chance, the next morning. We really custom ordered the omelette and this time they were pretty good. The customer service was a hit and miss. The first day was already and the second day was really good. The next few days I didn't care to keep track anymore. The Coffee was also a hit and miss. The first two days were very diluted and the three day was surprisingly good. I would not return there just for food. I would still eat there if I stay at the hotel and the breakfast is included.",

He understood my dilemma and picked up real fast that I was a discerning customer.  First, I checked in and to my surprise Yelp was offering a free tin of cookies!  The morning restaurant staff was not aware of \"tins of cookies\", but after I insisted that Yelp was offering a \"tin of cookies\", at check in, she checked and \"yep\", it was available for private events.  I guess I was going to be a private one-woman event!  I was told they would be waiting for me at the front desk when I came back from my conference. They were and they were warm and so delicious...I brought the beautiful tin and cookies home with me.  There were a ton of cookies in the tin - impressive!  The food: later I had room service and the manager helped me to decide.  I had a lovely gnocchi with oxtail and kale and it was delightful.  There was a side of shaved parmesan reggiano and it was divine.  I am so glad that he helped me pick that meal, although there seemed to be a few other really good choices.  The manager shared with me that they are a farm to table restaurant, and that their chicken and meat comes directly from this source.  The breakfast was great (the buffet) one day they served a delicious beef hash, and the beef was so soft and flavorful.  That was from the Farm to Table provider and was a one-day thing.  I looked for that HASH the next morning, but nope,  I was a little bummed, but, I needed no more calories.  Overall, I would definitely not skip the restaurant if you are staying in the Doubletree in Pittsburgh.",

We were indecisive on our entrees so she gladly put our \"snack\" order of the small antipasti in before coming back again to get our final entree order. The small antipasti order was larger than I expected. It was very good and we enjoyed trying all the different meats and cheeses. Our entrees: my steak originally came with steak fries but I asked to have the pierogis instead and she said there was no problem switching that. I'm not sure if that is a normal request but I was very happy since everyone on here said they enjoyed them and I wanted to try them (I'm used to freezer pierogis). Our main meals came in a timely manner and my food was delicious. Steak was perfect and very aesthetically pleasing. Pierogis were as good as I was hoping and the salad was fresh and good except,for me, was a little over powered by the dressing mixed in. I would recommend asking for it on the side to decide how much is good for you. I don't have a picture of the Bigelow burger my friend got but she said it was delicious. It was a huge burger that she cut in half and came with steak fries. The waitress was very attentive, refilled my drink and asked if we needed anything. Atmosphere was nice and calm. Definitely enjoyed the ambiance the restaurant portrays. Would definitely come again and tell others about.",

I really appreciated that consideration.        I enjoyed the compact menu because that means they can specialize on the few items available. I had the gator tots that were really creative and cheesy with some local cheese and their house-made ketchup. As soon as I was done with my tots, my skirt steak dish came out. After two bites, I realized it wasn't for me. I called my server, Jimmy, over and expressed my opinions and he was incredibly polite and professional. He then had the kitchen prioritize the sirloin dish and it was out within 5 minutes. This is incredible, specially with how busy the place was!       Oh my delicious goodness, that sirloin steak, salad and steak frites were stellar! I didn't have to add anything to it, it was pure bliss, I highly recommend it!       Ultimately, I had a great experience with the staff and the food. Kudos on such great customer service and flavor on the food. If your in the area, it's a must try!",

    "text": "Holy YUM!   Hands down the best food I've had in years & years & years. This chef is an MVP rockstar and I want to be his best friend. The staff is amazing & here's what I ordered (you want ALL of it, I promise)! I had the Brussels, the lamb burger, the pierogies, tomato bisque & boston bib. (I am one of the pickiest eaters I know & this food was literally so freaking delicious. Never in my life have I ordered so much room service or frequented a restaurant in a hotel this much. You won't be disappointed.)   Honestly can't say enough about every staff member I encountered - from the people who brought the food to me (in my room & the restaurant) to the manager. They went above & beyond! Bless them!",

    "text": "Came here for a glass of wine as we were staying at the DoubleTree Hilton. We got in from a late flight and wanted a glass of wine. The restaurant closes at 11 pm during the week but the bar stays opened until 12 pm. Was greater by the friendly bartender who had already closed but was nice enough to serve us some wine to go to our room. He was extremely accommodating and allowed us to taste the wine prior to committing to a glass. We were very pleased with his service and will return for lunch or dinner",
