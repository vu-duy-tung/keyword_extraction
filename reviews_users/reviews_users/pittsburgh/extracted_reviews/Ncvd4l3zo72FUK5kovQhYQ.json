Order food at the bakery counter- the menu is somewhat limited to omelets, salads, sandwiches, and crepes, but there's surprising depth to it.  My first visit I had a cup of chili with pumpkin pancakes, and on my second visit I had a spinach and goat cheese crepe with a side of chipotle sweet potatoes.   Everything was delicious!  The one thing I'd point out is that the food is good, but the service and appearance of the place are decidedly casual.  This is the kind of place where parents feel comfortable bringing their screaming babies and where table service is spotty.  But the food, the food, the food!",

My son loved the French Toast - warm fresh bread, carmalized bananas sprinkled with powdered sugar and of course lots of syrup.  Ca t wait to go back again.",

I am a big fan of the order, sit, and food is brought out - especially at breakfast. I've been twice so far and first time ordered the french toast with bananas- which was pretty awesome; second trip ordered a crepe - also was pretty good. When they get busy it's a little tough to come by coffee. It would probably benefit them to use a larger dispenser because I got half a cup and my boyfriend was out of luck until the next batch came out - then when it did there was a line of about 5 people all clammering for coffee. The more they put into it the better the experience is going to be for their customers.   A tip - there are real coffee cups, not just styrofoam. I hate drinking out of styrofoam so if anyone is like me you can get real coffee cups.   It's a nice place to go when cereal doesn't cut it...",

What I didn't enjoy was his adding up our bill in his head. He rounded up, which might not seem like a big deal if it's only a few cents but that is not cool, not cool at all.

Let's start with the surly staff.  We needed a table cleaned off and had asked for some help with that.  Quite a bit of huffing and puffing about it and a fair amount of eye rolling.  Sorry, we just wanted to have lunch here and pay you for it...  We ordered at the counter - 3 entrees in all to feed our family of 4.  We ordered the mac and cheese (bubbling hot and delicious looking but very bland), escargots (also bland) and a breakfast entree (I don't recall what it was exactly).  The food hit the spot (our family was really quite famished) but were not wowed by what we ordered and certainly not bowled over by the service.    We did end up ordering a Nutella and banana crepe after someone else next to us ordered a sweet crepe.  This was by far the best tasting item we ordered and the best value, too.  Though this place is pretty close to home, I'll probably not be back.  For what we paid, food and service just didn't add up.    The hunt for a French place in Pittsburgh continues...",

The crepes were very good, and I love the choice of side dishes-- they had interesting options. My husband had chicken/bacon crepes with a garden salad and enjoyed them as well.  My kids ordered the best thing, though-- French toast. They used a fresh baguette and it had slightly caramelized bananas on top. It came with caramel sauce and whipped cream. When the waitress brought it out and saw that my kids were going to share, she not only brought an extra plate, she put extra whipped cream on it so they could each have their own little pile of cream. It was *ridiculously* good, thanks to the bread.  Overall, this a nice little cafe that is surprisingly kid-friendly. Oh, and if anyone with a more exciting life than me ever feels like boozing it up at lunch (they close at 3, I think), it's BYOB sans corkage fee.",

They had escargot on the menu and in the case!  I had a lunch croissant with chicken salad and my coworker had it with tuna.  Sides are also interesting like ratatouille and french onion soup.  Drink selection is minimal however.  The chicken salad was amazing and the croissants were delicious, the tuna was also great according to my coworker.

The chocolate tart was delicious.   You walk in and order from the menu, when the food is ready they bring it to your table. The wait is not long. They keep the tables very clean, very efficient.  The only drawback is the atmosphere is a bit dull. Plastic tablecloths.  Needs a little warming up in the decor. Maybe some upbeat french jazz background music.   This is one of our favorite places in sewickley to go for brunch on the weekend. Family friendly and you don't feel rushed. Grab a paper and relax.

The food is pretty good and always fresh.  I like their omelets because they're light and fluffy, not dripping with grease (but I do need to add some salt).  I appreciate fresh ingredients and will pay a little more for them.  This place can get very expensive, though, for what it is.  You order and pay at a counter and basically take care of your own drinks, clean up, etc.  The prices are out of line with this self-service atmosphere.  Sometimes the staff will bring your food to you, but other times we've had to return to the counter to check on the food.   We are a family of four and can easily spend $40-50 here at lunch, or breakfast even.  That's way too much for a place that's basically a glorified Ikea cafeteria.  I agree with other reviewer's assessment of the staff.  Not the warmest bunch of ladies.  I went in once late in the morning to sit down with a coffee and read my email in the corner.  Oh the looks they gave me!  I couldn't understand it.  I was the only customer in a room full of empty tables, and they were looking at me like I was sitting there slowly sipping my drink during the rush with people lined up out the door.

We showed up at 10:10 and the lady at the counter was so nice about us being late and pointed out our reserved table. We probably would have had to wait 10-15 minutes otherwise for a table.  We ordered 2 breakfast entrees and 2 lattes at the counter which totaled $21--totally reasonable for a delicious breakfast for 2. The banana French toast was absolutely incredible. I had never had French toast made with baguettes before--it was so thick and crunchy and the combination of that and the bananas and whipped cream made me want to scarf the whole plate down. We also split a strawberry crepe that was delicious. The lattes were a little weak but still good. Very friendly service and welcoming atmosphere. I will definitely be going back soon!",

It was pretty good, but I believe it needed more filling and the crepe was a little bit doughy. But, I also tried the bluberry pancakes and the side of baked apples. They were both phenomenal and if I were to go back I would definitely go back.",

    "text": "I love this little cafe! I have had several different sandwiches & have tried their ham & cheddar quiche. The quiche is tasty, but a little too greasy on top for my liking. The caprese sandwich is also delicious: great mix of creamy cheese, crisp basil and juicy tomatoes. I think their baked apples are the best side: perfectly al dente & not soggy. The mac & cheese: good & not overly drenched in cheese. I think they're prices are a little above average but for the amount of food you get & the quality...right on point. A full quiche, plus 2 medium sides cost me $44 to take home. Definitely give this place a try over your big chain for breakfast & lunch!",

    "text": "I don't give out 5 stars very easily to any establishment but I was so pleasantly surprised by Cafe Des Amis that there was no other rating that could do the meal I had proper justice! Tucked down a side street in the Village of Sewickley, Cafe Des Amis serves breakfast all day (LOVE having that option) but also has a lunch menu if you're so inclined. Parking can be tricky but meters are free in Sewickley Saturday and Sundays (in addition to holidays) so street parking, if available, is always an option. Also, the Sharp Edge Bistro parking lot is a short walk away if needed. My family, my boyfriend, and I visited Cafe Des Amis this past Saturday around 12pm for a brunch/lunch meeting. The inside has tables for both smaller and larger parties and we decided on a table near the window for the 5 of us. You order at the counter and pay first. You are handed a number and then your food is brought out to you when ready. They have bottled beverages (coke products, bottled water, pellegrino,etc) in a cooler in addition to the option of just tap water or fresh brewed iced tea. They run weekly specials, and this week one of the specials was ham,apple, and brie on a baguette served with one side. This is what my mom opted for, and while she said it was very good, she took half home and said she would add honey mustard to the sandwich when she ate the other half. My brother chose the roasted chicken and brie sandwich  (lettuce, honey mustard , and mayo on a toasted baguette) and, although I can't comment personally on it, he seemed to enjoy it. My dad chose the HAT wrap (hummus, avocado, turkey, lettuce, tomato on a warm tortilla) and he said it was very tasty. My boyfriend and I, having run the Pittsburgh 5K only a few hours earlier, decided to go with breakfast, each of us choosing an omelet. He chose the bacon and brie omelet while I went with the zucchini, basil, and goat cheese omelet. Each of the omelets, like the sandwiches, come with one side. I did not try my boyfriend's omelet but he said it was perfectly cooked and he enjoyed the complimenting flavors of the brie and bacon. Here is where the 5 star review comes in to play: The omelet I ordered was hands down THE BEST omelet I have ever eaten in a restaurant! Typically, I don't order omelets so I don't have much to compare this one too, however, my boyfriend, who orders omelets frequently for breakfast, agreed that it was absolutely amazing! It tasted so fresh and flavorful and was light and fluffy. Although it was quite a large portion, it was not heavy nor greasy and was quite easy to finish. The zucchini tasted fresh and was plentiful throughout the omelet, and I loved the creaminess the goat cheese provided for the dish. I had the fruit as my side and the melons were as sweet as can be-such a nice touch on the warm day we had this past Saturday! I raved about my omelet so much that my mother has requested we return this Sunday for Mother's Day so she can try one herself! I hope we do go back this Sunday as, even though I typically don't like to return to a restaurant so soon,  my my meal was just that good!",

The staff and owners are all Italian and seem to lack understanding of what True French cuisine is. To be fair though, the demographic of the area seems unconcerned by this, nor seems to know what real French food is. Staff is generally rude and seem irritable with guests. Biggest issue is that the server was the dish washer and had been made by the staff to serve food without drying off their hands. Atmosphere is cute but cramped, and the food prep area is loud and chaotic. Have to go up to the counter to order which is chaotic and adds an amateur vibe to the restaurant. They are also only open early morning to afternoon. Good luck finding parking for this place! Will not return any time soon.",

I had found the place on yelp and was excited to see that it seemed like a cute little European marketplace inside.  The menu was written on a chalkboard with a variety of salads and sandwiches with another chalkboard to the side with savory crepes.  I decided on a coffee with the special of the day which was an avocado, sunny side up egg and bacon on a ciabatta and decided on the three bean salad as my side.  The bread for my sandwich was awesome with it being nice and chewy.  The avocado and bacon on my sandwich tasted nice as well with my only regret being that I didn't get the egg scrambled.  The three bean salad was good with a sweet vinegar type sauce.  All of my dining companions also enjoyed their meals as well.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  I liked the feel of the place and the food was good as well.",

Side dishes is laughably small portion - and I don't eat much. Staff yells at you to place your order. Dirty silverware and you have to serve your own drinks and water etc despite paying over ten dollars for a crepe and some potatoes. On top of that they have the nerve to leave a line for a tip on the receipt.   Oh and when we went to sit in the side room it smelled like a latrine.  Mm yum.   I've been to France numerous times. This place is thousands of miles off of French food. Terrible and overpriced. Head to Oakland or east Liberty if you want a good French brunch.",

    "text": "Was somewhat disappointed after eating here despite my initial excitement to try this cute little place being advertised as a French Bistro. While the food I had was tasty I don't really think it is True french cuisine. You order at the counter and food is brought to your table. Prices are very reasonable as I ate for less than $10 per meal. Terrible street parking.   I've eaten both breakfast and lunch here. For breakfast, the Garden omelet was loaded with veggies and goat cheese, both of which I love. I chose a side of fruit which was sad and pathetic. It had clearly sat on the fridge after being prepared the night before. For lunch I had the Chicken Apple Walnut Salad which is usually served with her house dijon dressing. Since I'm not a fan of dijon dressing, I opted for balsamic dressing. The salad was served with a small cup of balsamic vinegar which was disappointing. The salad itself was huge and loaded with shredded chicken, dried cranberries and chopped apple.   Overall, the food here was good but again, not the french cuisine I was hoping for based on the name. While they do have french type paintings hanging, I am not sure this is enough to call this place a French Bistro. This is the basis for my 3 star rating. I would return here if in the area and looking for a healthy and quick meal, but this isn't one of those must try places.",

The guys had the french toast. It was very sweet and the use baguettes, not good. The roll got hard and neither of the guys finished it. Their coffee was good but the mugs were super small. True it's self serve coffee but you can get up 4 times to have enough. We used the to go foam cups. Much better. Also had the garden omelette. That was made fresh and took up most of the plate. The best choice of the 4 of use. Will go back but maybe not for breakfast. Their crepes are popular.",

My husband had the crepe with egg, bacon & cheese w/ a side of roasted red potatoes. Again, generous portion & full of flavor.  The atmosphere was lively. It's a bonus that a lot of the food is prepared where you have a clear view of the process. There is also a display case full of culinary delights.  I only wish there was better ventilation as it was a bit smoky from the non-stop activity at the grills.  I enjoyed my experience overall & look forward to trying more menu items.",

    "text": "In Sewickley's dwindling world of restaurants I was very happy to finally make it over here. The restaurant has 2 sections one of which was closed off during my visit. Breakfast and lunch is served here all day. You go to the counter, order, and then you are given a number to take to wherever you want to sit.  Their regular menu is listed above and they also have daily specials. I had the opportunity to inquire about the specials and most of the sandwiches come with one side including soup. They have a soup of the day as well as French onion soup. The staff was very friendly and helpful in helping me decide. After drooling through the cases containing those tempting desserts and quiches I finally decided to order a salmon/avocado/lettuce on a croissant and pair it with a cup of French onion soup. Most beverages are served via a machine unless you are ordering a bottle from their refrigerator which includes water or other specialty beverages. Free refills on machine beverages.  I had the opportunity to inquire about gluten free and vegan options. I was told the new owner does have gluten free items on the menu and although they have vegetarian choices they are working on establishing a part vegan menu.  Once I got my drink, utensils, napkins, etc. I sat down and the man who took my order brought me a huge cup of ice along with large lemon chunks so I wouldn't have to keep going up and down. I got my soup first. The French onion soup comes with 4 small bread rounds for dipping. It was good but nothing that made it exceptional. I enjoyed it however, and the cheese was so soft it had that difficult to break away texture to it which I love.  When I got my salmon croissant this was truly exceptional. The croissant has that buttery taste to it and the salmon was cooked well and very good! It is quite filling to say the least.  After that I decided to splurge on a dessert. Although crepes are the specialty here I decided to go for the dessert of the day. All desserts are made in house and average about $5.50 each. I ordered the special of the day which took a while to bake but believe me this was the piece de resistance! The owner told me they had already sold out of the brown butter cake so he made up a chocolate lava cake with whipped cream on each side. My photo alone doesn't do it justice. Once I cut into it the \"steam\" from the heated chocolate began to flow out and it was so warm and outstanding! It was dense as he had told me but not overwhelming that I couldn't finish it. I was even given a box to take home if I needed to.  While you enjoy your meal table staff do come around periodically to clear up any items used so your table is fairly clean. Needless to say by the time I was finished with my lunch this place was packed with people.  Cafe de Amis sits on a tiny one way street known as Division St. There is limited metered parking on that street but don't let that deter you. It is not a far walk to Beaver St which is the main street of Sewickley and there is metered parking on that street and on the other streets that lead to it. The meter costs are the same no matter where you park.  This restaurant puts a lot of effort into the food they prepare and the end results are delicious. They are open daily only until 2 pm so it's a good place to grab breakfast or lunch. Division St runs diagonal to Beaver St about a block or so up and you can find metered street parking during the day since it sits near the business district of Beaver St.",

Slightly concerned but okay... ask for a lemon, and it's completely rotten, and was placed directly in my glass gross! I had to ask for a new glass because the women thought since I just took the rotten lemon out it was enough. So lemon issue aside..

    "text": "A lovely little gem tucked away off of the main drag in Sewickley Village, Cafe des Amis does well in offering up some classic French cafe staples, along with food that I would definitely identify as more American picnic fare (pasta salad, anyone?) They aren't a full on patisserie-boulangerie, so don't expect to find an extensive offering of pastry, croissants, and breads. Instead, go for what they are really good at: crepes.  They offer both savory and sweet, and the portions are generous enough that you can even split it with another person and still be quite satisfied.  I am a huge fan of another certain cafe nearby, but it has far less seating and gets crowded very quickly, thus also making one feel a little guilty for lingering at a table on a busy day. At Cafe des Amis, you can afford to slow down a little because it's larger. They've expanded to claim a space across from the main counter area, so if you'd like a slightly more quiet atmosphere, place your order at the counter, grab a number, and head across the hall to that area. All in all, a lovely option for brunch and lunch in the Village.",

Eventually found someone who could answer, it's like an Italian Wedding Soup, with the tiny meatballs, etc. Also we sat near a door that was being constantly left ajar by the staff resulting in a draft hitting our table. As the door doesn't close on it's own, might be nice for the staff to do that. I realize they are busy serving tables, etc. but I kept getting up to close it. Though the service was average, the food was outstanding.  Had the Special Quiche, Pumpkin, Spinach & Feta. It was incredible. Light fluffy quiche, with great flavor, loved the pumpkin touch. The pastry was so good, flaky (I'm guessing plenty of butter in there) and not the kind of crust you find left on the plate sometimes.  This crust was so good, not a crumb left on my plate. We finished the meal by splitting a Raspberry Tart. Again well done! The filling was spot on, served warm and the crust was excellent!",

    "text": "My experience with the place was ok I know where the place was but I would say one out 2 things were delicious which was The Quiche Lorraine was the best quiche I ever had good job but I have problem with the display of food and the Mac and cheese. First up is the display, I have no problem for food on display but I didn't really like how that the side dishes were shown were not appetizing and this is my opinion and I can see that the kitchen is pretty tight, but still some of the food on the display was supposed to be on a display. The next problem was the Mac and cheese, I know that side are supposed to be some what good but I thought that the Mac and cheese tastes pretty weird aftertaste but I think that there were some French cheeses like Guyere but the combination was not the best. But over all, were good things like how beautiful the place was on a such a little street in Sewickley",

    "text": "Delicious! I was grabbing coffee nearby and asked a local a good place for lunch. He recommended this adorable little French cafe.   Their menu has a great list of sandwiches and salads. They also have a ton of sides such as roasted red potatoes , macaroni & cheese, sauteed apples ect.  I decided on the BLTTA-- bacon lettuce tomato turkey avocado. It was served on a buttery croissant and i got to choose one side. I went with a side salad. I decided to eat in.  My sandwich was fabulous and the salad was hearty. Their salad dressing was great but unsure of the dressing.. Possibly French lol   I noticed someone's French onion soup and it looked great! Stop in you won't be disappointed",

    "text": "Cute little restaurant with friendly staff. I really truly wanted to love this place but I think I just ordered the wrong thing. They allow you to put anything in a crepe, not just what you see on the menu. We ordered a Florentine omelet inside of a crepe and it was very good. I ordered a chicken caprese crepe and it was oily and lacked flavor. The crepes are thin but somewhat crispy which is a little off putting. The French onion soup was good.",

Oh my grrrrawdddd...match made in heaven. My tuna melt also phenomenal. Def coming back. Thank you for this experience",

There is a sign on from Broad st to show you where the cafe is but the alley is very small so i suggest you to park on the big street and walk to this place.   Staff is very nice and friendly. Food is delicious and big-enough portion for breakfast and brunch. The cheese in their food taste authentic, unlike plastic cheese flavor from other breakfast restaurants. Would come back again!",

The staff is very friendly and go above and beyond to meet your needs! There is a lot of indoor seating and a few outdoor seats! They serve big portions, and you usually end up having to take some home (not a bad thing in my book)! Definitely will return!!",

You walk down a little narrow alleyway and suddenly come up onto a quaint, vibrant little breakfast/brunch cafe spot. The food was very good. We decided to eat lunch there and had chicken salad and tuna melt sandwiches, with their amazing French onion soup. The environment was fun and full of very happy customers. The service was great as well! We will be back, for sure!",
