We were never made aware of the charge ahead of time, so I was very upset.  They refused to remove the charge.    Been there several times to try different things, but the only thing that is consistent are that the portions are small for the amount that you pay.",

    "text": "Finally after four years living in the South Hills, we tried Al's Cafe on a Friday evening.  My wife, who is gluten free, ordered the perch dinner special.  It came breaded although not so indicated on the menu.  Ok, she should have asked.  The manager said it wasn't supposed to be breaded but the perch wasn't holding together, so the kitchen staff breaded it.  ??  They replaced it with perch broiled.  It tasted so bad my wife couldn't eat it.  The staff was apologetic and we weren't charged for her meal.  I had the standard fried fish dinner (slaw and fries) which was also featured that evening.  I didn't care for the breading but it was ok.  Just a bad experience.  I doubt we will give it another try.",

We had the sweet and spicy buffalo wings for an appetizer.  They were cooked to perfection - just the right amount of crispiness.  And, the sauce is no doubt the best I have every had.  For my entree, I had the Pasta with Crabmeat Fra Diavolo. This was a very large portion of low calorie deliciousness.  After the appetizer, I could only eat a small portion of it.  But, I can enjoy more of it for lunch.  My boyfriend ordered the Ambrogi Hoagie, which is their grilled cheese steak.  This sandwich was also the best I have ever had.  Yes, I made him give me a bite...  It came on half of a very large bun with piles of steak, peppers, onions, and of course cheese, and served with french fries.  Just superb!  Our server's name was Rose.  She was very attentive, but not too much.  She kept our drinks filled and made sure we had everything we needed during our visit.  I just can't say enough good things about it.  You will just have to try it out for yourself!  :)",

I have seen people there in dresses, suits, athletic shorts, and hoodies.  I gather from that...anything goes! The menu at Al's is insane.  You name it, in some fashion it is on that menu.  I have never eaten dessert there because I am always so incredibly full after my entree.  I can honestly say I have liked everything that I have tried.  Never a disappointment.  The bar area on a weekend is not the scene for young \"20 somethings\" to hang out.  That is geared for the 40+ crowd.  The atmosphere is set with all of the animals hanging on the walls around you. The wait staff is typically pretty good. I have never had any complaints about their service.",

She never greeted us, or brought our drinks over to the table, had to get her attention twice to order another drink after standing up at the bar for five minutes and asking for another drink while her back was toward us until she decide to mosey on over and act disgusted we were there. It wasn't a busy time. She was very unpleasant, and quite frankly will NOT return to a place that doesn't appreciate business.  There are other places to chose from, it won't be Al's Cafe again.

Overall this is probably close to one of the worst meals we have ever had.   Server zero knowledge of dining and bar. Asked if they had any craft beers on tap. She told me no, then I walked over to the bar and there is at least dogfish 60, Sam seasonal, and summer shandy.    I unfortunately did not get a beer or two, sorry Al's for not getting that extra $12 out of me.   Appetizers- got calamari, (which fiance wanted), rubbery.  Stuffed port mushrooms- underwhelming, fake crabmeat  Entrees- mother got prime rib dinner, was about a 5oz cut, overcooked and looked like a chuck dell.   Fiance got Reuben, it wasn't bad, the frozen fries were probably the best part of the meal. Reuben passable.   Finally I got the chicken a la Pittsburgh, which was an interesting combo of Marsala and crabmeat. I should of know then, to stay clear. Mashed Redskins were hard, and the crabmeat that came with the dish was of course fake and would fit into a teaspoon.   Will never go back.",

So I went back on Valentine's Day with my mom and sister and order another phenomenal meal of pecan salmon. But today when I went I reordered the taco salad and they gave me a bed of lettuce with onion, cucumber, black olives, tomatoes and no salsa or sour cream and told me that was the way they served their taco salads and I told them that's not what I received on Sunday and I quickly pointed the description out in their regarding both salads and the manager had the audacity to ask if it was at Al's that I got the taco salad like I did it known where I ate. I hope this was just a fluke and they get rid of the insulting manager. And they learn to make what their menu describes.",

    "text": "One of my favorite places for seafood. My husband got the large fish sandwich. It came with fries and a portion of col slaw. I looked on the lent special menu, and got the shrimp ravioli. It came with either a salad, or soup and fresh warm bread and butter. I had a small garden salad with ranch which was really delicious and fresh. The shrimp ravioli was so good, the alfredo sauce was homemade as I asked the waitress. The shrimp were a little small but I didn't mind because otherwise it would of been too much shrimp flavor with the alfredo. The portion size was decent and was enough to make me feel full and plenty. I used the warm bread to dip in the shrimp ravioli and that was key to a perfect meal. I really enjoyed our time. The shrimp alfredo was $15.00 and wasn't bad for the portion and delicious taste. Definitely will be back soon to try a fish sandwich like my husband tried just to try something else too. The sandwich was two big pieces of fried fish and looked like enough food to feed two grown men. He has some to take home as well. I ate my entire meal at the restaurant! Highly recommend",

    "text": "I use to go only on occasion. For a bar/cafe do they have a pretty large menu. But the prices are ridiculously over priced. You'd expect this in the city or in Peters Township but not Bethel Park. The food was OK, but nothing to write home about. Just not worth the high price is all.  But Monday night I left the house after the WWE Raw. I wanted to watch the 2nd half of the Pens game and get something to eat. I started off close to home and hit 4 other places before getting to Al's. Everybody else closed their kitchen at 11:00. so I moved on. Despite Al's kitchen not yet being closed I ended up not eating there at all. I was even willing to put up with the high price just to watch the game and eat.  The bartender was across the bar chatting with some customers. I sat down next to some co-workers. I asked them if they know when the kitchen was open till. The guy on the other side of me said Midnight. My coworkers said, \"Yes, you have 10 more minutes.\" I watched the Bartender leave the people he was talking to and go to the register then back to them 3 times. Each time chatting for a bit. They were paying but it shouldn't have taken that long, especially since a new person had walked in. I finally yelled across the bar \"DUDE\". He came over with an attitude towards me now and very rudely asked me \"What is it?\" I told him I wanted to order food before his kitchen closed. He said it closed 10 minutes ago. I said, these people all just told me the kitchen closes at midnight. He waved over to the clock and started making some rude comment about that already having passed when I knew full well it hadn't. I just grabbed my coat and left before I said something I would regret as one thing that pisses me off the most is someone is lying to me. Of course when I got to my car and started it up the clock in side still said 6 minutes to 12.  I asked my coworker today what that jerks name was because I wanted to report him to his manager. He said he is the manager. I said, well the owner then. He said that's him. Well since there is no way I can get any resolution since the owner is a complete and utter jag off I simply will never go back again.",

And the bartenders are great people. Just like I said the smoke is very bad and while you're eating your food people light up cigarettes right next to you it sucks",

Love that the kitchen is open late and the beer is always cold, but most importantly, Al's never fails to be our go to, don't want to eat healthy, pack on the calories restaurant. It is close to home and the hearty, filling food late at night is sometimes exactly what is necessary after a long, tough week. It is big enough that we're not normally ever seated by another party and the service has always been prompt. The mac and cheese is extra cheesy and the desserts are almost too decadent to handle. The only thing is that I find it to be overpriced.",

I had the \"small\" fried fish sandwich which was enough to fill up a giant. It was served piping hot as were the fries. The tartar sauce was excellent and the cold slaw was better than I expected.  I splurged on dessert with a slice of raspberry cheesecake which was absolutely decadent. Everything I saw the other guests get looked equally appealing. I will be coming back to this family style restaurant to try out more of their menu.",

I was visiting for the day, so we had lots to catch up on, or it wouldn't have mattered.  I am impressed by the menu, but even more by the sight of the hostess carefully sanitizing each used menu!  I never thought about it, but what an important job that is to keep germs from spreading.  We both chose the prime rib sandwich, cooked medium.  The fries were crispy and delicious.  Excellent choice for a leisurely lunch.",

I did not know it was going to be breaded & I cannot eat breading. So all I ate was my rice and by the time my waitress asked if everything was ok my boyfriend was already done eating. At that point I didn't think it'd be worth getting something different so I kept to myself. Not her fault but pretty disappointed the menu didn't say it was breaded & I had to leave hungry. Will definitely come back I just know what not to order now.",

Medium to Large at best and well under a pound.  Wasn't going to complain but manager came to table and asked how meals were so said you guys really cut back on shrimp and he got real defensive making excuses.

    "text": "My co-worker and I met halfway between our houses at Al's Cafe recently. While I've been there numerous times in the past, this is my first time reviewing. Please note that this review is based on both the most current AND all prior experiences.  The sandwiches we ordered at the bar were outstanding. He had the Ambrogie's hero and I had the cheese steak. The fries were cooked to perfection and the serving size was more than sufficient - not too much, not too little.   My compatriot also had the wedding soup, which he said was quite good.   The only \"drawback\" to Al's Cafe is the menu. I call it \"paralysis by analysis\", to borrower a phrase from my chess studies. It's simply too big. I know, I know... you never get tired of hearing that, amirite guys? Kidding aside, the menu is massive. That doesn't even factor in the daily specials(!).   I find it best to peruse the menu online before heading out to the restaurant. At least that way, I can narrow it down somewhat when I get there.   The staff is always friendly and helpful. I've never had anything but positive experiences eating at the restaurant.   My favorite part is dining near the fireplace when it's cold outside.   Outside of the big-azz menu, the only other 'negative' I have about the place is the price of (alcoholic) drinks. I ordered two vodka cranberries for lunch (don't judge me) and it was $13.49 after taxes and before tip. I generally like to tip @ $1 per drink ordered, so $15 later, I felt a little down in the wallet.  To make a comparison, my favorite bar close to home in Washington county charges me $4 for the same drink ($3.50 Russian Standard vodka + $0.50 cranberry + Free ice). Yikes.  I highly recommend Al's Cafe to anyone. It's kid-friendly and has a very separate bar / dining area(s). Tell them I sent you. They won't know who I am, but that's okay. You'll still get good service anyway.",

Once everyone had eaten and a majority of our guests had left the staff asked if we would move to the bar area as they wanted to clean the area.  The remaining few of us (less than ten) happily obliged. Many of these people were from out of town and some we had not seen in many years.  After a few hours of laughing and catching up, the bartender ( I didn't catch her name) told one of the hosts we all had to leave because we had sat in the bar area too long.  Yes, we were having drinks.  But not in excess. No one was rude, rowdy, or unpleasant.  Just a few family members and old friends telling stories and reminiscing. When the host asked what prompted this decision the bartender merely replied, \"I'm done with this\" and walked away. At this point everyone was confused and insulted at the rudeness of the woman.  The male bartender came over and apologized for her behavior and stated that because she had asked us to go, he could not override her decision.  We asked for the bill and exited.  We were given zero explanation as to what prompted her initial response.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.  We have used this restaurant in the past for similar gatherings.  But this most recent experience will cause us to choose another facility with friendly staff who appreciates that there are many OTHER options in the area.",
