Naan was good, and they were nice to our kids. Parking can be a hassle if you go when Mad Mex is busy.",

The Gonrua had just the right amount of spice mixed with sour Gongura leaf, awesome flavor, and the lamb was so tenderit practically fell apart on its own. The samosa was equally as good. Now the Naan, was probably the best i've ever had! I just wish I actually lived here so I could way more often! :)",

Takes a long time just to get water, have someone take your order or even get you your check. On multiple occasions, we didn't receive more drinks etc unless we asked multiple times.   With regards to the food, we had vegetable pakora to start and then had four orders of naan, navaratan korma, gobi manchurian, and tandoori chicken. The tandoori chicken was well done and they give you a lot of naan. Overall the food is quite flavorful and can make up for the restaurant's bad service. The gobu manchurian is a bit spicy for the average person so beware, you only get 4 gobis. The navaratan korma is very flavorful and the creamy sauce goes well with the naan; however, i was a bit disappointed that the amount of vegetables was so minimal. It seemed to be mostly a cream sauce with scarce green beans and potato here and there.  Overall, this place has flavorful food but they don't do the little things well.",

    "text": "We'd been meaning to try Tamarind for some time but didn't get around to it until this evening, and I am elated to tell you all that everything we had from starter to main to end was -- to put it simply -- a treat.  I am not Sherlock Holmes and thus am no expert on spices. My (damned) acid reflux also makes partaking in painfully high spice levels an act of poor judgement. I also like to taste what I am eating aside from seed-borne heat. The spice fiends of the Yelposphere who think that food is bland and worthless unless it deadens their tongues may scoff at my moderate intake of all things peppery, but I prefer my food to be a pleasure to consume, not an exercise in masochism. Having mentioned that, I found no issues with the pungency of what I ate.    In regards to my entree, that being Lamb Korma, I asked for a 5 and got something that playfully nibbled at my tastebuds without overtaking the other components of the dish. Rich and succulent as a Hungarian ghoulash, the Korma reminded me of an even creamier interpretation of the more conventional (and famous?) Lamb Curry. A squiggly line of what I assume was yogurt was drizzled atop the gravy for presentation. The lamb, braised exquisitely, was as delicate and suety as the zenith of pulled pork. Exactly what spices were in the Korma, I couldn't tell you, but they were there, hiding underneath the buttery flavors and even permeating the avocado and walnut-colored room. Accentuating everything, usurping nothing, the essences were indescribable yet omnipresent.   Kay's Tikka Masala cruised on a track parallel to the Korma, but included chicken, tomato, and onions to liven it up further. Kay was unable to finish her portion, so I...intervened. Both dishes were so luscious, when our excellent, friendly, and (interestingly enough) non-Indian server came by our table to see how our dinner was proceeding, I merely looked at her, closed my eyes, hummed, and swayed, much to her amusement and relief (the poor lass was dealing with a difficult party as we dined).   Our first course consisted of the savorily tangy bread pudding vs. falafel of Dahi Vada. The fritters of lentil could have been a dessert had there been milk and sugar involved, but instead, both of the large \"fried donuts\" came to us in a pool of raita (a white yogurt sauce) and embellished with carrot shards and other vegetables. Velvety and served chilled, I felt that this would be the dish to serve with or after something particularly piquant. Nonetheless, the weightless patties were an ideal counterbalance to the entree.  Rather than go with Naan, that staple of Indian cuisine I've enjoyed countless times, I opted for its billowy, crisp, hot fat-baptized variant in Batura. The most savorous fried dough in all of gastronomy, the gilded bread itself was feather-light, had bubbles all through it, and revealed a hollow interior when pulled apart to dip into and soak up whatever we pleased. If any Indian restaurant decided to open a booth at a carnival, they'll do well to make plenty of Batura for it is fair food that is at once familiar and exotic. I have had Batura before, but it had been so long that I had forgotten what it was called. Tonight's dinner was a pleasant and decadent refresher course on this Asiatic sopapilla.   I almost went with an Indian dessert such as Rasmalai to conclude the evening's experience, but when I found out that Tamarind makes their own cakes in their own bakery, I just had to take a pop at one. Feeling like chocolate cake (Tamarind has a wide assortment), we each went for just that and were pleased to find that it was moist, constructed ornately with multiple layers, ethereal in texture, and iced with an equally airy coffee-tinged frosting that resembled mousse. We were assured by our server that Tamarind does not buy their cakes elsewhere, and I am still trying to tell myself that I did in fact have myself a truly blissful cut of chocolate cake...from an Indian restaurant.  How common is that?   Savoring India, indeed. Drive up that winding road to find the hidden shopping plaza in the suburban sky and deliver thyselves unto culinary Vaikuntha.",

    "text": "This place keeps me yearning for more!  After hearing my friends talk about this place and after sampling their lunch specials at the local Indian grocery store (Manpasand), I decided to give this place a try. I have been here for a sit down dinner as well as ordered food to go.  Let me start by saying that the food is on the spicier side so order a level down than what you usually do. For our sit down meal we ordered Chicken Sangrilla (a new dish for me). This was tasty but SPICY (we ordered a 7 but could have done well with a 6). I could not really pin-point all the herbs an spices in this, however for a dish I never tried before, I found myself cleaning the plate. We also got the Chicken 65 which is fried marinated chicken strips (small pieces). While great in flavor this dish did not taste as I expected it to be (an overdose of spices that numbed my mouth). The two appetizers were however sufficient enough for our table of 4. BTW they do serve Papad once you place your order so you can munch on something till your appetizers arrive and they also have a full bar.  We then proceeded to get a plate of the Malai Kabab and Boti Kabab. Both of these were delicious - chicken was tender, lamb was perfectly cooked and both the meats were marinated well. In my opinion the size of the kababs were small. For entrees we ordered Kadai Chicken, Saag Paneer and Dal Fry. I am usually very picky about eating spinach at Indian restaurants but did not have any after-effects so I give the spinach here an \"all-clear.\" Since all the entrees came with rice, we supplemented our food with only two Garlic Naans and by the end of the night we were stuffed (haha maybe because of the sheer amount of food we ordered). I cannot remember if we ate any dessert.  Our server was attentive, food prices were in line for a 3 star Indian restaurant and the food was good (not overly oily or greasy).   During my second experience (take-out), I ordered a Garlic Naan, Sheekh Kabab and Tandoori Chicken. I felt like I was eating a health conscious chicken as the pieces were not very meaty. However, my major let down was the Sheekh Kabab - the meat felt dry, though still perfectly marinated.  Summing both my experiences, I would happily give it a 3.5 stars but to err on the side of caution a 3 for Yelp will be good for now.",

If you ask for extra spicy, you GET extra spicy.  We've been visiting this place on occasion for several years, and from the very first visit, we noticed that there were a lot of folks of Indian heritage frequenting it.  That hasn't changed.  It's tempting to order appetizers at an Indian restaurant, because usually portion sizes in such establishments are modest by Pittsburgh big eater standards, but that's not necessary here.  A papadum and some nan are the only sides you'll need consider.  The garlic nan is excellent, as is the dal.  My favorite dish is the lamb vindaloo, but the tandoori sampler shines, especially for those who are shy about curry.",

They asked me to wait for half an hour \"if you don't want half cooked food\", as quoted by the guy who took the order. 6 pieces of chicken manchurian was given to me in a box. It did not even fill half of the box in which they gave it to me. And the quantity of the fried rice I ordered was the same. Either give them in small boxes so that the customer doesn't feel dejected or at least fill the box upto 75%. And yes, it does not take half an hour to cook this quantity of food. This place is disappointing.",

I went on a Saturday night around 6pm it was busy but not packed. I had samosas and they were freshly made, crispy on the outside and tender inside with a little spice. I tried the szechuan chicken, basically fried chicken pieces with onion, green peppers and hot peppers which again were freshly made, crispy outside and tender inside.   I was looking for palak paneer (cheese in creamy spinach) which they call saag paneer, and they were helpful in pointing me to what I was looking for. It was a large portion with tender rice. I also had the garlic naan, which was good but I wished they had cooked the garlic a bit before putting on the bread, it came out kind of raw. Regardless it was delicious, including the mango lassi.  I like spicy so I asked for some chili sauce which went wonderfully with everything, so be sure to ask for it if you like spicy. A bit on the expensive side considering there are paper napkins, but the portions were generous enough that I had plenty for a meal of leftovers. All of the servers were friendly and professional, no complaints there. My one complaint was the music - a bit obnoxious and a little loud for my taste.  Overall a very good Indian meal.  The strip mall it is in is on top of a hill with only a sign with all the shop names visible, so keep your eyes peeled if you are from out of town.",

But once you got past the front door all was well.  Since I did not stay I can only speak for the service at the counter and the food. Both were good.   I ordered Shrimp Vindaloo, Naan, and the Black Forest Cake. So often as carry out you get ripped on the shrimp. Here there was plenty of shrimp and the Vindaloo was very good. It was very well spiced and the potatoes had enough time to gather up the flavors.  The Naan was a bit crispy for my taste. I like it tender.   I would go back for sure.",

We ordered some appetizers to share which included the vegetable pakora and the idly manchurian. Both of these were delicious. I really liked the idly manchurian which had a nice kick and texture.   For my entree I ordered the paneer tikka masala and an order of poori. This was the best tikka masala sauce I have ever had. I was enjoying eating just that over rice, even though there was plenty of paneer in the sauce. The poori was much different than any other poori i have ever had, but it was also delicious!   I can't wait to go back, but knowing how good that sauce is I am probably already roped into ordering it again!",

The seasoning, spices and flavors were amazing.   Our waiter was most helpful in suggesting appetizers and main dishes. Each person in our party had a different desire of \"spiciness\". He was able to recommend dishes to meet each diner's needs - and the kitchen superbly delivered with each level of spice. The level of attentiveness was ideal - meeting all of our requests, filling drinks, etc. without impeding our conversations and limited time together.   The family has since headed home, but I am already looking forward to my next trip to this restaurant. On a side note, I love meat in my food, it's almost a necessity.

However, I ordered Muttar Panir, and it was easily the worst I have ever had. It tasted like Velveeta with tofu in it. Tasteless and gross. My husband and I were spoiled by the authentic Indian restaurants in our previous town, and are also puzzled by the Indian patrons in this restaurant. They cannot possibly be eating the same food we were served. We did not eat our food and will not return. We continue to look for a good authentic Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh. (Sigh).",

I have no specific complaints about the food (other than the buffet-level spiciness, see below) but nothing was stellar. If I lived near here, I'd probably go back on occasion, but wouldn't make a long drive.  Important note: I was eating from a 30-person buffet, which partially mirrored the main buffet outside the party room. So I'll blame the fact that everything was bland on the please-everyone approach to spiciness (read: no spicy)...",

    "text": "I have been going to place for last 2/3 years.   I always liked the place.   I thought I should share my opinion with all yelpers.  This place is in Green Tree area.   Place is really nice and cozy.   They have a party room available on same premises.   If someone wants to have a party for 25 people, they provide you enough private place and cater food.   Parking is a bit struggle though.   It's in a strip mall where parking is shared with bunch of other places.  Staff is very well managed and they are always ready to help you if you are new to Indian food.   The owners are from South India and so the food is inspired by the south indian receipes.   They also are very flexible with how much hot/spicy you food you want.  So tell them up front and they make sure your taste buds are not burned.  They have some great appetizers.  Chicken 65 is my dish.   Other appetizers are also great and sometime we order too much those since everyone has there own preference.   If you like hot/spicy stuff, order  \"Cut Mirchi\".   These are chiilies deep fried in a lentil batter served with onions and lemon.  Excellent!  The Rice dishes are also very authetic and one should give it a try for their biryani items.   Biryani is Indian version of paella.   They serve pure veg biryani as well.   Chicken curries are excellent and we always like dish called Chicken Curry.  Chicken Tikka Masala is also another dish you can't go wrong with.    Veg entrees are also excellent and we like spinach with panir, channa masala.     Breads are also well prepared and you will be happy no matter what bread you get.  I love their butter naan.  Overall they do a excellent job and prices are very reasonable.   I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a nice Indian food joint.",

I'll be the first to admit that I've never traveled to India, so I'm not qualified to judge whether this is authentic Indian cooking or not, but I do know delicious, tasty, fresh, well prepared food when it is served to me.  And this restaurant puts out some delicious food.  We had some appetizer sampler platters (both a vegetarian & non-vegetarian), as well as a curry dish, a biryani dish, a saag dish, and one other vegetarian dish.  All of the food was wonderful, bursting with fresh flavors.  We do not get Indian food very often, so it's a real treat when we do, and this place made it extra special.  All 4 of us enjoyed everything that we had.  Overall, it's a great place to go, and I'd highly recommend it.  When we dine out, I'm looking usually looking for really good food, good service & a nice ambiance, and that is the order of importance for us.  I can live with mediocre service & no ambiance, so long as the food is good.  But bad food cannot be compensated by service & ambiance.  This restaurant had really good food, and good service.  The ambiance is the weakest card in the deck for them, but it's a restaurant in a strip mall, and the food was so good, we'll be back there again any chance we get.",

The buffet included mango lassi that was refreshing and just a wonderful. I was in heaven... I am definitely going back soon. So far, Tamarind Savoring India is my favorite place to go!",

I have been to Tamarind in Oakland numerous times and it has always been delicious so I was excited to try the Tamarind in Greentree.  The Tikki Masala I ordered was not spicy and the sauce was way too watery.  Also I was disappointed in the portion size, there were probably 4-5 pieces of chicken.  Where they redeemed themselves was in the naan, the garlic naan was superb!  Overall, it wasn't a terrible experience, but it did not live up to the expectations I have from going to Tamarind in Oakland so for now I will stay in Oakland when I am craving indian.",

    "text": "The price tells me the food is upscale, but my senses disagreed.  On my quest to eat at every Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh and perhaps even the world, I knew I would eventually have to be drug out of my city and into the suburbs to tick a few off my list.  This branch of Tamarind is owned by the same person(s) who manage the restaurant by the same name in Oakland. The Greentree location is more enjoyable in ambiance, largely because there is more space comparatively. The dining room is pretty and relaxing, with dark wood accents and tone-on-tone muted green striped walls. The server that helped us was excellent at doing so, attentive, and friendly.  Where things fell short for me was with the food. I enjoy a meal typically at medium spiciness or in the range of 5-6 if on a scale of 10. This is a pretty typical scale around these parts and this is the way I always order, but the Navaratan Korma that I ordered came at around an 8. I have nothing to prove by eating spicy food in terms of asserting my own toughness, so food this spicy only proves to muddle the beautiful mix of ingredients in the sauce to me. About the only other note I could really taste was a lot of sweetness, which sometimes happens with this dish. I wasn't impressed with this one though because they use a mix of vegetables, some of which come prepared either from frozen or from canned when the way this restaurant describes Navaratan's ingredients is as \"garden fresh vegetables.\" Navaratan translates loosely as 9 jewels and so the dish traditionally has a mix of 9 vegetables, fruits, and nuts. This misstatement was a disappointment and was misleading, as I would not have ordered the dish if it had not been for that description.  My husband's food experience was a bit better. He got the mysore masala dosa and it was delicious. It doesn't beat the Udipi dosa, but it was the second best dosa in Pittsburgh that I've found.  We ended the meal with galub jamun, but I would suggest you skip it or try something different for dessert. It was pretty forgettable and the pieces had no texture other than mushiness.  I'm not really sure why my experience was so different from all of the 5-star ratings I'm seeing from users before me. While this wasn't a bad experience, I certainly wouldn't drive out to Greentree for a special trip. Pittsburgh is fortunate to have so many Indian restaurants, and there are far better ones out there where you can spend your time.",

    "text": "I adore Indian food and am always looking for great places that serve it. Let's start by simply stating that I've experienced the best Indian food (made by Indian mamas) and the worst (grocery curries in pouches) and I eat it all. But I know good Indian food when I see it, and this wasn't it.  I ordered my \"usual\" (which I use as a baseline) and there were several things that were off with my meal. First, my appetizer, the Samosas, were heavily deep-fried on the outside so they looked like Chinese egg rolls, which was a weird experience. I've never seen a samosa that looked like that and it was unfortunate because it made it too crunchy and hard to get into it. The filling was perfectly delicious and the chutneys were acceptable (not great, just ok) so I moved past it.  The Chicken Tandoori was tender, but lacked the correct amount of spice. It was odd because again, it wasn't bad, it just was slightly bland for tandoori. I guess that works for the generic American palate, but in my mind that's not the point of a traditional Indian restaurant. The way the chicken was displayed was lovely and they didn't skimp on the cabbage or thinly sliced red onions so all in all I was pleased with this dish.   I found the Naan to be a bit too thick and doughy, which again was simply a bit off. It was tasty bread, but it felt more like the consistency of pizza flatbread, not authentic naan. I buy pre-packaged naan at the grocery store when I'm craving it and I would say this was on-par with that. Not bad, just not that great.  Lastly, my Aloo Gobi Masala (a potato and cauliflower curry) was VERY greasy. I was horrified to see so much grease in a dish that is supposed to be healthy. What did they do to the recipe to make it look like that?! The size of the chunks of veggies in the dish were also far too large, which speaks to a general laziness on the part of whomever was acting as the \"sous chef.\" Don't get me wrong, the dish was generally flavorful but I've had much better, and the greasiness put me off of it a bit.  That's how I felt about this whole meal - generally good but not wonderful. I saw another reviewer noted that they were adding fake flavors and oils to their dishes and I agree, I think that's what is going on here. I can pay the same price and get better made Indian food elsewhere locally (see my review history), so I won't be wasting my time here again.",

Everything that we have ever ordered has been top notch, and the experience at the restaurant was even better then we had expected it to be. The Garlic Naan is a must, we like to dip it in the Tomato soup which is amazing. We also love the Fried spicy cauliflower, ginger chicken, dosa, and of course the staples like Biryani and Tikka Masala. Another nice thing about this place is that they have a full bar, which is rare for an Indian restaurant. They have a weekend buffet which is next on our list! Anyways, prices are very reasonable, service is great, and food can't be beat! Check it out!!!",

The mixed grill was an expertly grilled combination of lamb, shrimp and tandoori chicken. I had the pleasure of dining on the lamb korma which was the best  have ever had.  Tender chunks of lamb in a creamy korma sauce. It was so good I could have licked the plate. The chicken masala was also very good but spicy. The nan was precut so it seems like more than it is which I didn't like. The best of the dishes was the delicious, crispy, sweet, spicy Gobi Manchurian. This is a must have dish.    The restaurant is byob so bring your favorite wine. The corkage fee is 10.00 and we were told by the manager that this was per bottle but our check only showed 1 fee and we had 2 bottles. this brings me to the service which was excellent. I have no complaints. TIP: on your way out visit the grocery store next door",

Sambhar wasn't spicy and didn't have the zing needed, kept on thinking something was missing. Chutney wasn't great either. Mango lassi felt more watery and a bit too sweet.  Staff was really weird. They were not attentive, had to keep calling them several times only to go unnoticed. The restaurant wasn't busy at all and I still don't know why the staff was so reluctant to help customers. It did get busy by 9:30 pm when we left.  Didn't try any of the curries, since I was disappointed with sambhar. The mango kulfi wasn't all that bad though.  The location is also a bit out of the way, as the GPS doesn't lead you to the right location and the name on the board isn't bright enough on a busy street to get noticed. Not coming back.",

But we reached before 3 and picked up our order and were waiting for the manager to make the payment @3:10. That's when I see there are a couple of tables still finishing their food. That's when I asked the manager why did he say that everyone will leave by 3:05...when he knew that they are going to be there at least next 30 mins..and could have given at least 10 min grace time? FYI: First I apologized saying yes it is my mistake but you shouldn't mislead someone when they are requesting 5-10 mins... which turned in to a rude conversation and he was not polite at all...he was not willing to listen to me at all. I was just trying to say it was snowing bad it could be a risk!! HE WAS YELLING...you should know time management etc....never going here!! The owner should know how to train their staff regarding customer service!!",

I have no idea when your kitchen closes. Its not my business to think about when your kitchen closes. After the first guy, two more guys extremely loudly and rudely said the same thing even though I said I wasn't interested in eating in their restaurant after the insult. One of them said, everyone in the neighborhood knows we close 15 mins earlier. Really, buddy? I would have gladly taken a to-go if they were polite but declined their offer from fourth guy after the attitude I got from previous ones. No apologies while I was leaving.

Servers were friendly and helpful answering any questions related to the menu. The don't remember much in regards to the decor but the atmosphere was warm and intimate. Limited bar seating was available with a TV.   As for the food, if you are new to Indian food, when they say spicy, they mean spicy so be careful! Unlike some places that say stuff is spicy even though it barely is, they really mean it here! I love spicy good so I had the  chicken vindaloo which was delicious (one of their spicier dishes). Also tried the chicken curry which I liked even more. Both served with white rice. Garlic and onion naan very flavorful and highly recommended especially as a compliment to a spicy dish. Also had a fried vegetable appetizer that was breaded in a deliciously spiced chick pea batter and fried. Husband had a mixed grille dish that he enjoyed and would get again. The Hurricane was yummy but I don't think it had much alcohol content.   This seems like an authentic Indian restaurant and I'm looking forward to eating here again!",

    "text": "We went here on a recommendation from a friend. They opened at 5 and we arrived shortly after so we were he first ones there. We sat down put in an appetizer that we wanted before our meal. For our entree I ordered the chicken tiki masala and hubby ordered the chicken fried rice.   After about 5 or so minutes another group walks in behind us and is seated. They were regulars because thy knew the waiter by name and he knew them as well. They placed there ordered and waited as well. About 10 minutes later I see food come out but it wasn't ours. The couples who came in before were enjoying their appetizer before us. I thought, well maybe ours took some time so we kept waiting, then after another 10 minutes they brought out their entrees. It wasn't until they received their food that the manager comes over and tells us there was a problem with our receipt and it didn't print in the kitchen so they never received our order.   He offered to pay for our mango lassi's to compensate but I was already upset about the long wait time. Our food finally arrived and it was just ok. The chicken was tougher than I'd like it to be. My husbands rice was really good though so that was one plus.   I think I'll pass on this one and keep going to the Taj Mahal on the North side. Sorry tamarind. Better luck next time.",

Stopping through town we were here on a Wednesday and was surprised how busy it was. Food and service was quick, waters were always refilled. Spent less than 30 dollars for two big meals.   We tried the pepper fry with chicken and the chicken chettinadu. Both were VERY spicy and flavorful. If you wanted extra spice, eat the peppers that are in the sauce.   We'll be back here for sure!",

We were seated and waited 15-20 minutes for someone to get our drinks. We had to ask someone to take our order. There was people who came in after us and had their meals before we even had our drinks orders.  Before placing our order we told the gentleman we want our checks split to 3 separate checks. And he said that was fine. He took our order and after 45 -60 minutes of waiting our food comes out. The guy refused to give us rice that came with 4 out of our 5 meals. We had to ask the girl who was helping the guy deliver our food for our rice. She gives us 1 small bowl for 4 people to share.   Then the lady came over for our checks and I told her that the checks were split and she handed me the receipt and said ' I will not split the checks you can figure it out yourself' at this point I went to the register and talked to the guy and the girl who refused to split my check and said we want our checks split we are paying with cash and card. The guy made the girl go back over to our table and not the original guy who I told initially when taking our order. I told him I wanted our server to split the check and he refused to come out of the back and the guy said 'hes the back of the house waiter'. So the girl walked over to my table and hands me the receipt and told me to 'figure it out myself.' the checks got split the right way.   Never again will I ever step foot in this place again. The way the workers treat you is absolutely ridiculous and my family comes here very often. I refuse to give my money to an establishment that talks down to you, refuses to give you half your food (but charges you full price) and just be downright disrespectful.",

Chicken Biryani was so flavorful. Also they serve unlimited dosa on the table.  Great service. Not enough I was there on Sunday too. Again a very different menu and spread. Mango Chicken Biryani was unique and amazing apart from Tandoori Chicken and majestic Chicken. Deserts were delicious especially the bottle guard halwa.  Icing on the cake was a live chaat station where they served pani puri. I don;t think we get this kind of authentic food even in India . Keep up the good work!!!",

    "text": "Ok, I was very excited to check out Tamarind! The outside of this restaurant is a little strange. It's located in a plaza, but the outer windows are pretty much blacked out - couldn't tell if the restaurant was open from the outside.  We were seated right away, and it was pretty busy for a Wednesday evening. Our server was attentive at first, grabbed our drinks.. but then totally forgot about us for the rest of the evening! We weren't in a hurry so it was no big deal, but was almost funny towards the end \"Did she forget about us or what?\" However, another employee (I'm assuming he was the manager) was EXTREMELY FRIENDLY, and got us beverages, cleaned plates, etc.   The wine selection was TINY! Large selection of bottled wine, but per glass was very limited. I ordered the Cabernet and I wasn't too happy with it. Wasn't high quality and I thought it was a relatively small glass for $6.99.   The food took a while to come out - but it was good! Very high quality, not huge portions. Great flavor, great spice as well.  Would I recommend tamarind, yes - sure. However, I wouldn't say to come here if you were in any type of hurry. I look forward to checking out their weekend buffet - but I'm sure I will be checking out other similar restaurants before coming back here any time soon.",

Everyone raves about the Sunday brunch and I agree, it's pretty good...HOWEVER my absolute favorite is the special biryanni. It's not like your typical biryanni. What makes it amazing is the chicken on top. It's a generous portion of rice with a huge portion of this red colored chicken curry. Make sure to get it not spicy! The morsels of chicken are absolutely delicious! I once asked the guy how the chicken on top was made and he simply replied as \"special made\" and I respect that.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Saturday night with my wife for dinner. I had never been to Tamarind Savouring India before but my wife had and we were in the mood for some Indian food.  Since Tamarind was in the Entertainment book that's where we headed.  It's located in a strip mall right off of Greentree road.  While the outside makes it look somewhat small the inside is actually pretty large.  It is painted in vivid and warm colors like orange and yellow and has some Indian artwork on the walls.  My wife and I ended up getting seated at one of the booths.  For dinner on this occasion I went with the chicken chettinadu (spicy curry cooked with coconut milk and traditional South Indian Grounded Marsala - spice level 9) while my wife went with the chicken tikki masala.  Then since we were both hungry I ordered the green chile and cheese naan while my wife ordered the garlic naan.  Whenever it came out everything looked fantastic with my chettinadu being a greenish colored sauce with lots of chile peppers showing while my wife's entree was in an orangish colored sauce.  Not only did my dish look good but it tasted good too!  There were layers of spices which all helped to form a nice depth of flavor.  It was also very spicy but not overly so which was perfect for me.  As for my naan, well it was pretty fantastic.  It was almost like eating a flavorful grilled cheese flatbread.  The green chiles added a little spice while the cheese was flavorful, ooey and gooey and the naan itself was good.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  My wife and I both had a hankering for Indian food and Tamarind certainly hit the spot for both of us.",

If you like north indian food, best to avoid this place altogether. For whatever reason, most north india dishes taste as if they have ketchup in them here. Food is unnecessarily spicy.  Avoid...Bad Indian Food.",

The patrons that eat here kinda smell, no surprise there.   They give you complementary papars before your meal however two of mine were hardly prepared right. I thought my Chicken Tikka was way too dry and lacked sufficient flavor. My garlic naan was over cooked and didn't have any taste of garlich. I really enjoyed the mango lassi however. Service was on the slow side and took them a while to bring my check and boxes for the food i could barely finish.   Maybe this place was having a bad day when i went or maybe i want this place to be good.   I will try this place again for redemption",

We called and ordered our meals and was told it would be 30 minutes. I waited almost 45 minutes before arriving at the restaurant and then had to sit there for an additional half an hour before my food is ready. Other then apologizing, it was no attempt to explain, to rectify, or to somehow make this a better experience. I kept being told to just take a seat and wait. When I arrived home, only one dish was hot. All of the other dishes, appetizers and dosas, were ice cold. The ratings are for our dining experience.

Mango lassis were excellent, sweet and smooth. For entrees we had the mixed tandori grill, Lamb Korma, and chicken with peppers.

I'd never had it before, it's kind of like a savory pancake, wrapped around delicious stuffings.   We got dosas, idly, gobi manchurian, naan, chicken korma, lamb saag, gongura chicken and chicken tikka masala. All the food was fantastic, we all enjoyed it very much and stuffed ourselves.

Plus the shirts they wore had a quote on the back that read \"Keep calm and curry on\" which I thought was great. We ended up starting with the assorted veggie sampler which had the best pakora I've ever tasted. The my girlfriend got the Malai Kofta and I got the Kadai Paneer. They were both fantastic.

The food was pretty serviceable overall, but the portions of meat were very small. The tandoori was very frustrating, as it appeared to have several well-prepared pieces, but two of the five had almost no actual chicken on them. On the plus side, the meat was moist and flavored well. The rice, garlic naan, and roti were tasty, but the breads also felt overpriced for the quantity. We liked the tikka masala more than the curry. The downside was the portion size (a small plastic container, not even completely filled) and although it was pretty flavorful, it was missing an extra note to really tie it together and brighten up the dish.   Considering the convenient location, we may end up ordering from Tamarind again, but we will certainly not rush back.",

    "text": "Wow. I am from Columbus but went to Tamarind in Pittsburg for second time. Had a buffet. Food was too good. Starting with chicken and mutton kebab. They were very tasty and authentic . Then had the naan, lamb curry and vege sides. Everything was tasty and tasted like home food I get in Tamilnadu. Chicken Briyani, pongal and rasam were also good. Will definitely go again anytime I go to Pitt again.",

    "text": "A disclaimer before I get to the review.  Since I'm Indian and have lived in India for a number of years, my standards for Indian food are probably higher than most people's.  I rarely go out to eat at Indian restaurants since my mother can beat most of them, even on a bad day (the exception being South Indian food, dosa, vada, idli etc.). Now that that's over, I'll say that Tamarind is about as good as most other Indian places in America, A-OK.  We had the Goat Biryani, the Dahi Paapdi, Andhra Spicy Dosa, Non-Veg Tandoori platter, and garlic naan. The goat biryani wasn't what we were expecting.  And since I've lived in Hyderabad and visited Lucknow a number of times, I think I have a pretty good idea of what biryani is.  It had way too much green chili and pudina.  The Dahi Paapdi just wasn't that flavorful at all.  The dosa and tandoori platter, on the other hand, were both good.   The sambar, idli and gunpowder were on par with spots like Sarvana Bhavan (in America).  The tandoori platter was generously portioned and perfectly seasoned.  Finally, the garlic naan was great (one of the best I've ever had).  Piping hot, slathered in butter with exactly the right amount of garlic. If your standards for Indian food aren't super high, Tamrind definitely won't disappoint.",
