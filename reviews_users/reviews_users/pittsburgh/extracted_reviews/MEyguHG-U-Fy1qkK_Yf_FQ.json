Ordered an appetizer.. that did not arrive for over an hour. The food came shortly after that. The only redeeming quality about this place is that it wasn't cold when it arrived. Service was also terrible. When we asked the waiter about the appetizer that was taking forever, he gave us a sassy reply like he thought we thought he was making them himself. My food did not have any corned beef inside of it either. Big letdown Would not return",

We wanted both pierogi's and sandwiches however we couldn't get sandwiches because they had no bread?! The bathroom looked like a crime scene, the handicap bathroom was taped off, the floors were filthy, no hand soap but a big open bottle of commercial handsoap was on the counter, no paper towels. The service was slow and not very friendly. The only positive was the food was amazing (over priced for the service and appearance)but good however had I went to the bathroom before we got our food we probably would have left. We ended with over hearing the staff complaining because the dishwasher was broken. Very disappointed because we have been looking forward to eating here but would not recommend.",

    "text": "Literally the worst food experience I have ever had.  The restaurant was packed-- and everyone seemed to be having a good time, so my husband and I waited for a solid 35-40 minutes. A staff member stated we could sit downstairs-- said they were remodeling, but it was a space.  Little did we know that there was absolutely NO heat and they had space heaters (2) placed down there.  We reluctantly sat down, as we had waited so long and had an event starting decently soon.  Another couple was seated at the table next to us.  The waiter took both our drink orders then left.  Then he came back with the other table's drinks-- but not ours.  He then said he would have our drinks-- and then took down both our table and the other table's food orders.  He had a notepad and seemed to have been writing down our orders (not complicated-- no changes to the items).  10 minutes later he finally came back empty handed-- got to our table and was like YOUR DRINKS- then ran and got them.  Fast forward another forty minutes, the other table asked when the food would be coming.  He said it should be up now-- and went back and grabbed the food. Our food was apparently not ready-- I asked about when our food would be ready-- he said let me check on that for you.  Fast forward thirty more minutes (the other table had finished their food and cashed out), he came and said there was a problem and he never ordered our food-- but no worries, he had put it in now.  Frustrated and hungry, we said that's fine. Give us our check now and we will pay.  20 more minutes, our food came out.  My husband's meal was supposed to be a grilled chicken sandwich with all the fixings (lettuce, avocado, bacon, etc.)-- he literally got a piece of grilled chicken and one piece of bacon.  I got the perogis-- onions and butter and cheese.  My perogis were both severely undercooked or burnt depending on which side of the plate I was eating from.  They were basically inedible.  Our waiter came back with our check (he comped one beer due to the wait) and asked how the food was-- I stated that the food was inedible. He shrugged his shoulders.  Do not waste your time at this restaurant-- I am not one to complain about restaurants-- but I have never left a place so angry in my life.",

We visited late on a Friday evening after the dinner rush so we were seated promptly. The atmosphere is industrial and rustic with a full bar at the front. Our waitress, as well as all the staff we encountered, was extremely friendly and happy to give recommendations on what was popular. We ordered a couple drinks, our mules weren't that great- I think next time We would stick to beer. My boyfriend is a pierogi lover and couldn't decide. He went with the classic onion and I chose the Buffalo chicken... When our meals arrived we realized we could have split one entree. Again, the portions are unreal!!!! I'm not a huge lover of pierogis but I did enjoy these... Especially with the Buffalo chicken on top. We will be back as there are other interesting combinations we want to try, but next time we will definitely split.",

I posted my review on there and anyone who commented negative reviews gets their review deleted so I posted it again no response from owner but again my review deleted.  Then the owner started sending me messages to harass me telling me I was harassing him by posting my honest opinion of his place not his sanitized version. And this was on Xmas eve!

We waited for at least 40 minutes on our food. The wait staff visited our table as little as possible and we sat with water glasses empty throughout the dinner. When our order finally came out, two of the orders were wrong and a side of fries were forgotten. The \"Pittsburgh salad\" was served without the Pierogis and the waitress acted like she had no idea there were supposed to be Pierogis on it. When asking about the side of fries, we were asked if we asked for them when we ordered... they never came and weren't on the check (so we know the order was never placed). The concept is good, but the food in general was bland. We had multiple types of Pierogis on the table and we all shared, but they were so under seasoned we were all disappointed. Parking is regular downtown Pittsburgh parking, either you pay to park in a garage, or you're lucky enough to find street parking within a few blocks of where you're going.",

We sat at the bar and has an AWESOME time with the help of a fantastic bartender named Nathan. HE made our experience there memorable and entertaining. That grapefruit vodka mixed drink---so perfect! Conversations with him, some of the other staff, and a nice couple from Texas really made this experience one worth sharing.

My aunt and I were at our table and this customer approached us who was clearly intoxicated and stood in front of our table and kept talking to us which is fine I'm not going to be rude but then he asked me if he could give me a foot massage which is obviously creepy and I said no thanks and was hoping he would leave and he did but then he decided to come back and ask me if I wanted his male parts (in a more polite way than what was said) it took everything in me not to punch him in the face . I went and told the manager and she kicked him out after she told me that he was just standing around being weird prior to this but she thought he was harmless and she thought he had something wrong with him. There was nothing wrong with him except he was extremely intoxicated. The manager should of called the cops on him for harassment but she didn't. What upset me the most was the waitress were laughing about it and coming up to my table and asking about it they thought it was funny even the manager was joking about it. I just think it's extremely disrespectful and it was handled properly at all. I know that the staff cannot control other people's actions but they could have came over and apologized or asked if everything was ok but they didn't they thought it was a big joke. I'm paying 50 dollars for a meal to have some drunk guy harass me and management just use it to their entertainment. When I was a waitress I would of never went up to someone's table after they just had a bad experience and try to ask them about it. That is just extremely unprofessional. Also our waitress was so invested in talking about what happened then doing her job we had to ask her multiple times for sour cream and she kept forgetting our drinks. I will never come back here this was the second time and the food is sub par for the price and definitely not worth the unprofessional behavior.",

I really enjoyed the pierogie plate I shared with a friend (fried mac & cheese), but didn't enjoy the ones I ordered on my own very much (pan fried spinach & cheese).   But honestly, the issue here is the service. It's horrendous. I went for lunch, and it really wasn't all that busy. The food took nearly an hour to arrive. The server was not super friendly, but somehow also seemed slammed... yet there were very few tables.  This was our second try. The first time we came at dinner time, and we waited in line for a while only to be shown to a downstairs area that was still under construction. We decided to leave.  Considering this place has been open for several months, it seems like they should have it together by now.  Based on the food, I would give this place another shot... but the service is so bad that it's quite unlikely.   If you decide to go, just know you'll wait ages for your food and the customer service will leave much to be desired...",

    "text": "Nope. Not into it. Sorry to disappoint yinz but the excitement of having a restaurant dedicated to the beloved pierogi is pretty short lived once you go and actually eat said pierogies. I met my boyfriend there one night and he ordered the chicken parm pierogies and I ordered the cheeseburger. I don't  have too many issues with my order. It was what I anticipated but was pretty mediocre. The chicken parm pierogies my boyfriend got were pretty sad looking though. They looked as if they sat out and the cheese had hardened on top. They were also pierogies stuffed with chicken and then covered in chicken, sauce and cheese...For once in my life, there was just too much meat.Chicken on chicken and it wasn't very appetizing.   A couple of side notes that probably make me sound like a jerk. The waitress forgot about us a couple of times and even told us. It was pretty dead in there and I have to admit when I was 18 and a waitress, the slow times were definitely my weakest times. So I get it but she probably shouldn't have continued to tell us how she forgot we existed.",

    "text": "Guys. I am so sad to rate Stuff'd one star, but I seriously have no other choice.   I went with 3 of my friends for a birthday dinner. When we got there, there was literally one other table. I gave our birthday cake to the nice bartender who said she would be happy to help us when we were finished with dinner. Our waitress was friendly, and helped us decide which pierogies to get. The pleasant experience basically ended there.   After we watched the entire restaurant fill up, eat, and leave, our server came back to let us know that the kitchen lost our ticket, and we would be getting our food soon. My friend and I got the blueberry mint mojito. It was ok, but we never had the opportunity to get another one because no one really came back.   At least thirty minutes later, our food finally showed up, but we were missing an order of pierogies that didn't show up at the table until everyone was done eating.  Our server was very apologetic, and it seemed like she was having a rough day, but everything about this experience was awful.   We all got cheeseburger pierogies boiled - if I were just rating those, I would have given them 3 stars. We also got fried mac and cheese pierogies, and they were doughy, covered in slimy sweet onions, and nacho cheese. I wanted them to be bomb, but they weren't and it was sad.   When we asked for help with the birthday cake, it took like 15 minutes, and all one of the servers did was drop it on the table in the grocery bag it came in and walked away. It kind of felt like something was happening all night long with the employees because as the night went on (we were there for over 2 hours), the service got worse and worse. We ate our cake as quickly as possible, our server told us our meal was comped (except for our TWO drinks) and she would be back with our check. FIFTEEN minutes later, and we still didn't have a check so another server just told us to leave. It was a real drag.   TL;DR, this place has a lot of kinks to work out, but I hope they do. It will be a long time before I think about going here again, but the concept could be really cool.",

    "text": "Very underwhelming pierogis that left me feeling Stuff'd with nacho cheese overload. The concept is there I will give them that, but this place just wasn't doing it for me. My coworkers and I arrived around 11:30 and the place was not busy at all. They basically only have 1 picnic table, a couple of booths in the back and a couple of barrels turned into high top tables. We ended up sitting at the very uncomfortable high top tables. I'm a girl that likes to cross my legs to sit and that wasn't going to happen sitting around a barrel. I will point out they do have a very nice bar area though (1 of the positives).   You get 6 pierogis that are a decent size, just not worth the price or flavor left on your taste buds. I originally wanted to order the breakfast pierogis until I seen they were $16. I am a frequent brunch goer and I have tried many different spots in and around town. My brunch entrees are never $16 so I couldn't justify it for pierogis. My coworker did end up getting them and he said they were not as good as he had hoped.   I ended up ordering the Mac n Cheese pierogis \"boiled\" because I am a big fan of Mac n Cheese. I was pretty disappointed when she brought out my plate to see large amounts of nacho cheese dumped on my plate. It also comes with sauteed onions which I'm okay with, but I'm not sure it went well with the nacho cheese. It also comes with a side of sriracha sour cream. I left it right in its origin... on the side. Sriracha sour cream and Mac n Cheese just don't belong together in my opinion. For the pierogis themselves I was hoping to see the potato filling along with the elbow noodles stuffed inside. It was basically a pierogi stuffed with buttered noodles and that's it.",

I know there are usually specials, but I'm not sure this is a place that will unfortunately last long. The appeal may wear off to be honest.",

Perfect for the woman who wants it all.  I got them boiled, and they were lightly pan fried.  I think I should have got the spring roll fried.  The spring roll was not even close to being as good as a real spring roll.  So I don't recommend but I appreciate the creativity.  But the Rueben was fantastic.  It was a meant to be combination.  Great beer selection.  I couldn't resist getting the Evil Genius Purple Monkey Peanut Butter and Chocolate Porter.  Very good surprisingly.  Service was friendly.  Fun place all in all.",

She anticipated questions and answered them before we even asked them. She also suggested that we save room dessert (everyone in our party completely agrees with that recommendation) and told us we could get half orders if we wanted to try more kinds of pierogies and still have room for the amazing dessert pierogies. I can't wait to go back and try more!  The only down side is that the table was very unstable. It was cool looking (glass on a barrel), but you had to hold the glass when cutting through the pierogies or the glass would move.",

Then when we got our checks the drinks were crazy over priced. Two of my friends had black gunk in them. The perogis were subpar and well over priced. So when we mentioned to the server she sent the manager to talk to us and she was very accommodating but their was a man that may have been the bar tender I don't know why he was even worried about us... But he proceeded to yell, cuss and point to our table saying things like \"how old even are they?\" Poor excuse for an employee. We were told he was to be fired as soon as we left. I would say that he should have been fired immediately. Worst experience ever. Will never return, I wouldn't go back if someone paid me, I'm so glad we drove from clear out of town to be treated like garbage.",

Then I saw all the bad reviews, which I'm glad I didn't listen to.   I think by the time I came here for lunch, they might have figured out some of the kinks because I enjoyed my experience here. The service was quick and we were in and out in an hour. There were so many interesting choices (such as chicken parm, mac and cheese, pulled pork, cheeseburger) and it was so hard for me to make a decision. I ultimately ordered the reuben pierogis and they were so good! The pierogis were filled with corned beef and cheese, topped with sauerkraut and dressing. You have your choice of boiled or fried pierogis, which \"boiled\" is actually boiled and then pan-fried and \"fried\" is deep fried.   I will say that this was an expensive lunch. For $16, I only got 6 reuben pierogis. I didn't see much on the menu for under $10. I may come back if I've got a hankering for pierogis, but for the price alone, I don't see myself coming back often, especially for lunch. If price isn't something you're worried about, this is a pretty cool place and definitely worth trying!",

I thought they'd have more on the plate for the price which I would've happily paid if they were the best damn pierogies in town but they were not.     I had the buffalo chicken and hubby got the chicken parm-the buffalo chicken was too saucy so you couldn't really enjoy the flavors since everything else was so overpowered by the sauce - hubby's chicken parm was better.

I wish I had been hungrier.  The portions are large and one order of six fills you up.  In fact, I shared it with someone and it was plenty.  There is a full bar and it's nice to enjoy pierogis with a glass of wine, which is not possible in many pierogi places.    The location is in the middle of downtown Pittsburgh, so you have to be down there already or it's kind of a pain because you have to drive and find parking (in a big garage, in our case).  Probably the people who go here work in the area or are going to the theater.  It's in the theater district.  I would go back because I thought the food was really good.",

All so far a plus.  Menu is simple showcasing that the name of the bar is pierogi. Many to choose from. I love saurkrat and potatoes. They were all that I wanted and more. Topped with chives and caramelized onions. And under the pierogi was a like of saurkrat. That buttery goodness.  Yum it was worth the price. The prices here are a little higher. But the quality and portions make up for it.  A cool idea is for the bar to create a sampler platter to try them all.   I would recommend trying this place. It's new and neat concept plus a Pittsburgh favorite dish.  They are still new so limited drink menu. I will have to come back and see of they do some cool drinks to go with the theme.",

    "text": "A great concept that was poorly executed. My friend and I came on Friday for their soft opening. The restaurant is well decorated and has a warm feel to it. We were given menus and I was surprised to see that they had their full menu out. They have a wide variety of pierogies to choose from the classic potato and cheese to buffalo chicken. The prices are on the higher end as 6 pierogies are $12-$16. We decided on ordering the potato and cheese pierogies and the spinach and feta pierogies. No one had taken our order for a while and then finally our waitress came over and said \"I am so sorry. I forgot about you.\" I was slightly appalled I have never heard a waitress say that. Anyways, she said there would be a wait, because they just opened.   Well, we did not realize how long this wait would be. We came in at 8 pm and at 9 pm, we still did not have pierogies. They also do not have any appetizers, so we could not even munch on anything. At one point, our waitress comes over and says that she is so sorry, because somehow the cooks did not get our order slip. By 9 pm, my friend and I were ready to leave, but luckily we saw her coming with our food.   So the pierogies were alright. I was expecting amazing out of this world pierogies as that is the only thing they serve and they were just average. The potato and cheese ones were lacking flavor. The spinach and feta ones were unique, but the stuffing was so little. For the price we are paying, I expected better stuffed pierogies. Also, my friend found a hair in her spinach and feta pirogues, which then turned us off.   Unfortunately, I do not think we will be back. I was very excited for this place to open, but after our terrible experience I don't think I can recommend it. It was probably our worst dining experience ever in Pittsburgh. I realize it was a soft opening, but they were clearly not ready to open. Maybe in a couple months, they will have their act together.",

Definitely not 4 or 5 stars because service (including the lone bartender who kept disappearing downstairs) was painfully slooooowwwww and there was a bit of drama between the wait staff which they didn't care if customers heard or not. That and some hoochie mama bartenders from the adjoining club came in and out a few times. All things considered, a little low brow. Sorry. They had the UFC fight on at least, so...4 stars it is.",

We hadn't realized that it'd be packed with impatient baseball fans trying to get to the Pirates game. The wait was going to be too long, so when they offered us a space downstairs we jumped at it. The restaurant expansion isn't exactly finished yet but our group of 8 didn't care - we were there for the pierogis, not the decor.  We were actually served by the general manager, Carl, who went out of his way to give us an excellent experience. The kitchen was really backed up and it took us quite a while to get our dinners, but Carl checked in on us often and made sure we were happy. He could not have treated us any better and he definitely made us feel valued and important. We enjoyed chatting with him and appreciated his time and attention.   We all had an excellent experience - amazing food, outstanding service, and a fun memory of Pittsburgh. Thanks, Carl!",

    "text": "How is this place still open? Four of us went this past Saturday. Got there at 6:30 and figured we'd have to wait for a table. As an aside we tried calling four times during the day when they were open only to not have anyone answer and it go to a full mailbox. Anyway when we got there we were told we'd either have to wait for a table upstairs or go downstairs which is still being remodeled. We decided to wait. I did look downstairs and it is definitely still in the remodeling phase. Exposed wires and bare walls all around. A table opened up upstairs and we were seated in about 15 minutes which wasn't bad. Then the problems really started. Ordered drinks and food right away because we heard about the wait. Drinks came about 10 minutes later. The beer tasted like something was wrong with the line. Probably hadn't been cleaned for a while. Salad appetizer came about 30 minutes later. Meals didn't come for over 1 hr after we ordered. Our waitress tried her best to be attentive to us but that didn't help with having to wait this long for pierogies.   I had summed it up to a place that opened too early and they hadn't worked out all the kinks, only to be surprised that the place has been open for over one year!  My only conclusion is this has to be a front for some laundering illegal money. There's no way a restaurant that is this terrible in customer service can still be open. Which is really a shame because the food is pretty good and it's a neat concept for restaurant. Maybe a real restauranteur will take over the place and make it a real restaurant.",

I'm hoping that our experience had to do with the soft opening status....although they have been open a month.... My family LOVES pierogis. We were so excited to go and even planned our entire day around this place.  I was actually angry when we left. Here are some bullets to sum up the experience... -when we walked in the manager was yelling at a cook in front of the door -none of the staff smiles. I could write the entire review about the staff. -they ran out of chicken -they ran out of mini pierogis for the salad so they just didn't bother giving any. So it's $16 for lettuce. -our food was wrong when it came out and when they corrected it- it came back wrong again. -I paid extra for a fried egg. I got a burnt egg that was hard and not edible. -the pierogis were still frozen on the inside. Those not frozen were just cold.... - my 9 year old said \"This place is gross.\" -the manager apologized while looking off into space and then greated other customers mid sentence....but....the only good part of the night is that he gave us a discount.",

    "text": "Visiting my daughter in Pittsburgh and found this restaurant on Yelp. Being pierogi lovers, we couldn't wait to go for dinner. Arrived about 7:30 on a Sunday evening and there were very few patrons in the restaurant. Took about 45 minutes to finally get our order and let me just say, we were extremely disappointed. My deep fried pierogis were so over fried. The pulled pork was delicious but couldn't make up for the bad pierogi. My daughters' boiled/pan fried pierogis were rubbery and cold.  It took so long to get our food and we had plans afterwards we didn't have time to even ask for the pierogis to be reheated. We asked for the check along with our meal. While the food was a major disappointment, our waitress was very friendly and apologized over and over for the delay. Don't think we will be back. Took our meals to go but tossed them in the trash as soon as we got home.",

    "text": "This pains me to write this review.  I have been a big fan of Stuff'd since it has opened. However, the last few visits over the past several months have been disappointing.  I have just chalked this up to being a \"one off,\" but sadly I can't give them the benefit of the doubt anymore.  I go to Stuff'd during lunch if I am in Pittsburgh during the week, and I take out of town guests here as well.  I also have Broadway season tickets and loved stopping here on Saturdays after the show.  Over time, the patronage after shows at the Benedum has dwindled significantly.  Basically, no one goes there anymore after a show. It is easy to get a table on a Saturday night.  I have always told co-workers to stop here for the pierogis, as they have been delicious. Buffalo chicken, cheeseburger, and reuben have been my favorites, although I have never had a bad meal here.  The pierogis, fries, and haluski are delicious.  But our last visit at 10 pm on 2/2/19 was baffling.  What is happening to the service?  The reviews are speaking for themselves, but no one seems interested in correcting the staff's behavior.    1.  The restaurant is freezing  2.  We were seated, and although waitresses kept passing us, we never got our drink orders taken or even acknowledged.  Finally after almost 10 minutes and making eye contact with someone, she came by and asked if we were taken care of.  3.  The girls at the bar are more concerned with hosting a frat party with their friends at the bar than conducting business.  We finally got our food order placed.  Then there was a drunk, loud, aggressive, and belligerent patron who continued to move from staff person to staff person, being very loud, singing, and making racist comments.  Staff kept glancing at us but said nothing, nor did they do anything to calm him down.  We were later told he comes in frequently and acts like this, and he works next door at the club.  4.  The lights are out in the women's bathroom, and in the hallway to the bathrooms.  Then randomly, two girls walked into the restaurant from the back door!  The bartenders must use this entrance for friends because it was clear they were not staff.  After 30 minutes, we asked about our order and was told she would check on it.   About 5 minutes after that, we realized one of the staff that the man was spouting off to was the cook!  So no one was actually cooking our meal this whole time?  We threw $5 on the table for our waters and left.  We went across the street where we were seated immediately, given our drinks, and our order was taken immediately.  We were treated the way restaurant patrons should be treated.  We also quickly got a very delicious pizza.  My past experience with Stuff'd is what kept us sitting there for 30 minutes in this frat party.  They also were not bussing tables or concerned about dinner patrons at all.  While we were across the street, we were told people routinely leave Stuff'd with the same complaints.  I hope the management and owners realize the staff is running this into the ground.  I would hate to see this place close.",

    "text": "I came for dinner with a friend last week and we enjoyed our experience. It's definitely a bit spendy for pierogies, but if you are going to a pierogi bar downtown, you should be expecting the trendy factor to cost you more than buying them at a local church fest. The interior is beautiful and I loved the whole ambiance of the place. We were the first to arrive for dinner, right around 5:30 and after about 20 minutes, the place was packed!  They have extensive options, so everyone should be able to find an option they like. Mac and cheese, cheeseburger, reuban, veggie, cabbage... you can be as plain or exotic as you like! I love that they offer the option to have them fried or boiled too. We split orders of fried potato and cheese and boiled cheeseburger and really enjoyed both, although I always prefer the boiled over the fried! Each order comes with 6 pierogies, which was surprisingly enough.   The best part of our experience was easily the service. Our server, Amber was amazing. She was very polite, personable and extremely attentive. She made sure to keep our drinks flowing and took great care of us overall.",

    "text": "*sigh* I waited a few weeks and decided to give it another try for an early Sunday dinner (non-game day).  I stand by my prior opinion that the pierogis are really good. The food isn't the issue. It is managing the inventory and staff. After being open on a weekend without major Pittsburgh sports, they were still out of so much of the menu. Not to mention half the taps were empty.   It started with the drink list. There should be a drink list by now. Having your waitress hand you her order pad to read the bottled beers and wine is not my idea of professional. And the service is just plain bad. The staff was unpleasant and continually interrupted us. There was also a very strange encounter with a man (manager maybe?) when one of the diners commented (to himself) that $13 seemed pricy for 6 pierogis. (I agree, a bit pricey, but as I've said, they taste good.). I was with several first timers from out of town who were really excited about the place.  It reiterated that I won't be back. When we got there there was only one other couple in the place. It got busier, but t wasn't crowded by any means. Dishes and drink glasses were never cleared, and it seemed like we were just an inconvenience to the staff. This isn't a new problem, this is the same issue with the prior iterations of the restaurant. It is a shame because the concept is a good one. I work a block away, this could be a go-to place for my coworkers. They need to bring someone in to help with the execution or it is going to suffer the same fate.",

There were two waitresses working and they continued to walk past our table and neither offered to take food or drink orders and then the bus boy finally asked our drink orders. Both girls seemed annoyed to be there. We waited nearly an hour for our DRINKS. Which were three waters and a sprite and the girl who ordered the sprite never did get it. When we finally had the opportunity to order food we asked for our check at the same time as we didn't want to wait another hour for it as well. We had to wait to track down silverware after we got our food and our request for the sour cream the menu states the pierogies come with was met with an eye roll. It was also beyond freezing in the restaurant every time the door opened an arctic chill filled the whole place. The food was decent though it was lukewarm/cold by the time we finally received it. but the service was horrendous and we already knew we wouldn't be returning based on the length of time we waited for water.",

    "text": "To say I was excited about a restaurant based on Pierogis is a bit of an understatement. This past Saturday I finally got a chance to check it out.   At first glance of the menu I knew it was going to be tough to decide among the plentiful pierogi options. Pulled pork, buffalo chicken, chicken parm, were strong contenders, but two of those options were sold out, which admittedly was a little annoying. Especially for it being a Saturday around 5p. But the food and vibe made up for it.  The pierogi traditionalist in me couldn't resist the pierogies with kraut.   They were friggin delicious. The kraut was sour and tangy, and the pierogis were perfectly puffed pillows of potato pleasure. Boiled then sauteed.   I enjoyed them with a profound intensity.  I also ordered the house salad which also comes with two deep fried Pierogis which was a great way to get my veggies in AND try the deep fried Pierogis. Best of both worlds if you ask me.  Stephanie, our waitress, was also amazing. She was friendly, attentive, and very sweet to my mom who Stephanie knew, recently lost her sister. Stephanie's kindness was a much needed breath of fresh air!  I'll definitely be back!",

Seemed like they are still doing some renovations when we were there. Doesn't seem like a very big space but there are some tables and seats at the bar. Out waitress was very nice and service time wasn't terrible for us despite what some of he other reviewers said about slow service.   I think the concept of a place like this is cool but I'm not sure if it will be good enough to last. I think menu still needs a little work as the apps and sides weren't exciting so we didn't even get one. My husband's Asian style pierogi was tasty, it was soggy. The macaroni and cheese pierogi were tasted good. Basically, pasta stuffed in pasta with cheese. Was supposed to be served with a siracha sour cream but I tasted no actual siracha flavor. I'd be interested in coming back to see what it's like for the grand opening.",

No one had any complaints about their entrees. Now the okay - we got the special, the red hot onion rings - which weren't at all spicy hot, but they came out and were definitely red and temperature-hot. Decently crispy and bright red like Flamin' Hot Cheetos, but like any other rings otherwise.  Lastly the bad... which was most of the rest of our experience. We ordered stuffed cabbage as an appetizer to only get two \"rolls,\" which were flavorless and disappointing. The cabbage was undercooked, and it seemed like marinara sauce was dumped over the top almost as an after thought. Our drinks were also terrible. Strong but mostly flavorless, like drinking rubbing alcohol. We drank them because we paid for them but would not recommend this place if you're looking for a good cocktail. Our waitress was also miserable and she seemed irritated by our presence. She tried to seat our table of six at a table that would have been a tight squeeze for four. She hardly came to check on us. And she was generally short and her tone was rude when she did interact with us. If we were to ever go back, it would probably be only for pierogies to go...",

My boyfriend and I went to their \"soft opening\" which didn't seem as low key as I expected. There was no hostess and we were called by the ONLY waitress to go find a table. We were not greeted for probably 20 minutes. The menu looked great and definitely unique. I ordered the pulled pork pierogi because I can't say I've ever seen that offered before.   Well...1 hour and 45 min passed and we finally got our food. Why didn't I leave like I saw many other people do? I don't know. I was still excited. Pierogi were soggy and not authentic tasting to me at all. They apologized of course however they really weren't that busy by the time we were still waiting for our food.   I'm sure its lesson learned and they're probably much better and hopefully more prepared now. But, if you're looking for authentic pierogi/ Eastern European food, this wouldn't be my first choice.",

We had been planning to go out with our group to celebrate my birthday and I picked this place after seeing a couple articles on it. Then, we saw on Facebook that their phone lines were down, so my wife messaged them to make reservations for our group. They replied in a timely fashion stating that they couldn't do the time we requested and offered up a few other times. She wrote back agreeing to the time, but we never heard back in the form of a confirmation. She messaged them again, crickets.   I had a dinner meeting a few days later right around the corner, so me and couple coworkers popped in to have a drink and confirm my reservation. The bartender staff was rude when we asked for a beer list, pointing to the taps, snarled when we said we weren't ordering food and then put menus down in front of us anyway. We were almost done with our beers by the time the manager came out, and after scrolling through what looked to be hundreds of Facebook messages, he stopped at one and insisted that he replied to my wife confirming our reservation (she never got it) and then put the phone up so I could see that he had replied, but I knew they never replied, she sent me a screen shot. He took my name, pushed our reservation back 15 min from what we originally agreed upon and we never heard from them again.

    "text": "I first visited this restaurant shortly after opening.  I wasn't impressed, but friends convinced me to give it another try. We came with our three year old twins prior to a performance at the Benedum and were pleasantly surprised with how accommodating they were.  We were seated in a booth that worked perfectly for our family.  Our server was extremely helpful and friendly.  She let us know that even though they don't have a kids menu, they do half portions for kids.  Honesty, I wish more restaurants offered this option because my kids are more adventurous eaters than the typical kids menu. We ordered a kids portion of the Mac and cheese pierogi, chicken Marsala pierogi and chicken Parm pierogi.  Somehow the Mac and cheese ones ended up being buffalo chicken (surprisingly, my son actually really loved them).  Our server was extremely apologetic (even though it obviously wasn't her fault since they had the right sauce on them). One thing that struck me was portion size.  They definitely improved this from my first visit.  I remember feeling hungry after my first visit.  Not so now.  There are six or seven decent sized pierogi on every plate plus the toppings.  Very filling and tasty portions. The mac and cheese pierogi are exactly what you'd expect.  Pasta stuffed in pasta and covered in a creamy cheese sauce.  My kids absolutely loved them. The chicken Marsala ones were packed with flavor.  Shredded chicken inside with shredded chicken and Marsala sauce on the outside.  Mine were a tad bit dry, so I had our server bring me some extra Marsala sauce. I learned from our server that they make all the pierogi daily in their downstairs kitchen.  You could tell she was passionate about her job and pierogi the way she talked about the process.   Something important to know if you are going to the theater (since you can't bring food into the theaters) is that they will store your food for your until after the show!  Great to know for future reference because the portions really are filling. Overall, a great restaurant that I will definitely return to.",

The server was nice but there is no reason for pierogi's to take so long. Really poorly run establishment. I got the buffalo chicken pierogis and this is what I got. They put a whole chicken on it basically probably to cover up the mess they served",

Every single one of us, even the first-time pierogie eaters loved the food, but the restaurant was still kind of dirty, and the server seemed untrained. It's a shame because this pot has great food and really loads of potential but I'll be pack in Pittsburgh soon and likely won't be able to leave without stopping by once.",

Like others have stated, there wasn't a hostess and it took forever to be seated. There looked to be only one poor girl who was the waitress, hostess, and bartender! Clearly that wasn't her fault, and for everything she was doing her service was as good as she could provide.   As for the food, it was not good. Very overpriced! $12 for 6 pierogis. I ordered the potato and sauerkraut pierogi, which stated on the menu that they were Stuff'd with potatoes and sauerkraut, they were not. I ate one and realized they were potato and cheese pierogis and when I asked the waitress why the menu stated otherwise she said \"for as long as I've worked here the potato and sauerkraut pierogis were potato and cheese pierogis topped with sauerkraut\" this restaurant is called STUFF'D and they can't even bother to stuff the pierogis to match the description of the menu.   Not only that, but our visit was over TWO hours long! It was about an hour until our order was taken and it took another hour to get our food! And when we did finally receive our food, 5/6 dishes were barely room temperature.   I would not recommend Stuff'd to anyone.  Oh, and I almost forgot to mention that I found PLASTIC in my food! I'll attach a picture of my leftovers because I was too hungry to take a picture to start with because it took 2 hours to even get my food!",

Walked in and saw everyone working there standing around and taking behind the bar. Waited a bit, no one acknowledged us, so we assumed we would seat ourselves. We started to walk past the bar, then someone finally looked at us and said \"we'll seat you!\"    We went back to the entrance, and noticed that there were two tables staring at menus with no drinks or food. They both looked pretty frustrated. One person behind the bar was watching the other climb the ladder, then spent some time talking to her friend who was leaving. She did not bother to look at us or seat us or do anything else to secure us as a new customer.   A table from the back got up to leave, frustrated at the lack of service, and the table near us was desperately trying to get someone to wait on them. The employees remained steadfast in their commitment to ignoring all patrons and talking to each other. Reading the room, it was clear that if we ever got seated, we would never get food. We left, never to return.",

    "text": "Oh Stuff'd, I had such high hopes for you. When I heard there was going to be a pierogi restaurant in town I was beyond thrilled. I started to hear from many people that it wasn't good. I thought to myself...I'm not picky about my pierogi's so there's no way I can be disappointed. Sadly I was proven wrong.  I went in with high hopes and everything on the menu looked amazing. It was hard to pick between all of the options. After much debating between the mac n cheese and buffalo chicken I ended up going with the buffalo chicken. After hearing what my coworkers had to say about the mac n cheese I think I actually got the better pierogis's. Their plates came out completely smothered in what looked like can nacho cheese and onions. You could hardly see the pierogi's under all the cheese.   As for my buffalo chicken pierogi's, they sadly were a disappointment as well. When I think of different variations of pierogi's I expected there to be some resemblance to pierogi's with at least some potato filling somewhere in there. NOPE. No potato in sight for any of our pierogi's. At that point are they even pierogi's anymore?  One of the other main reasons I have given this place such a bad review is due to the prices. This isn't a high class restaurant so who wants to pay $14-16 for 6 pierogi's?! I probably wouldn't have been so disappointed if my terrible food was at least reasonably priced. Instead I got a terrible meal and I was out $16+ after my tip.  It's not often that I try to tell yelpers to stay clear of places. Even if I'm not a huge fan I will tell others to check it out because they may feel differently. That is not the case with Stuff'd. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",

The bartender, Sheila, was nice enough and gave some suggestions for drinks. She then informed us that register was broke so she could either take exact cash or punch in our credit card. Ok, no problem. Technology breaks down all the time. We had our drinks and placed our food order then all heck broke out.   You see this place is right across from the Benedum Center so everyone looking for a place for dinner and drinks before the show will crowd a place super quick.   Well Sheila was overwhelmed. The busboy was trying to seat ppl and get them non alcoholic drinks but they could not keep up. Ppl were lining up at the door. Others were frustrated from lack of service and walking out. Then the best thing ever happened. My food came!!!  I got the pan seared buffalo chicken Pierogies and my husband got the chicken parmigiana deep fried Pierogies. Oh, my!!! These aren't your grocery store, mrs t's pierogies. These things were massive and there were six of them. I still feel them in my belly.   Unfortunately while we ate at the bar we got to listen to Shiela complaining about all the guests. \"Isn't there s Burger King down the road?\" \"If they don't like it they can leave, I'm only one person.\"  We finished our meal and left.   At first i thought this was just a very bad night for this place. Maybe ppl had quit or call off work but talking to a friend and reading other reviews this is normal. I don't know what kind of staffing struggles this place has but they could do much better with their quantity and quality of employees.",

There are vegetarian options (the pierogi dough is made with eggs), but their menu says they are working on a vegan option. They have a great selection of local beers.

They're also pretty darn expensive for only six but they're good and that's what counts right?  I had the Mac and cheese fried pierogi and the spring roll one. They were definitely stuffed and jam packed with flavor. Will I be back? Yes. Did this place live up to the expectations and pleasantly surprise me? Yes! The staff here are also super cool.

We let her know that we had tickets to a show which is why we ordered quickly. We had to ask for the drinks and it was apparent that they had been sitting at the bar for a while. At 6:30, we inquired about our food. (The couple that came in in front of us were finishing their meal, as were the two couples that came behind us.) By 6:45, we asked for our check. The food never came and the excuses were lame.  Plus, it was freezing in this place. They had 2 heaters, one at the very front by the door and back by the restrooms.

The menu is quite extensive, with MANY different pierogi options that I never would have even thought of... surly something for everyone!  My friend ordered the cheeseburger pierogis and could not stop raving about them. I ordered the buffalo chicken salad, which included three deep fried pierogis, on top of lettuce and shredded chicken. Next time, I would just order the pierogis, as there wasn't really much lettuce to the \"salad\". Nonetheless, the pierogis served on top were very unique and tasty. The blue cheese dressing was also delicious  (not sure if it's homemade or not, but it was very good).  They also had a great drink menu which included many local beers, as well as fun cocktails. Overall, it was a little bit pricey for what I would consider a small portion, but we enjoyed the food and drinks and the Pittsburgh feel to the restaurant. I'm excited to go back again to try out some of the other option, too.",

Both were undercooked and doughy. Likewise I wouldn't recommend ordering any sort of speciality drink. We got two martinis that were not made correctly. If I ever go back I'll try the fried pierogis instead.",

I got the deep fried Reuben and the pulled pork and they were both really amazing. The only downfall to the place is that it's going to cost $14-16 for 6 pierogis but you'll be full enough when you leave.",

    "text": "This is really a 2-star experience, but the third star is for the wait and bar staff, who went above and beyond. We arrived at 6PM, place was nearly to capacity. Ordered drinks, which came quickly and were very good. Ordered food, fairly basic pierogi orders - we had a show to go to at 8PM, and didn't want to eat too much. After about 45 minutes, the food had yet to show, and our waitress looked upset. She talked to the manager, and made sure the order had gone through. At about 7:15PM, we were given some comped drinks, and were noticing that all of the guests around us (most of whom arrived after we did) were finishing their dinner already. The food arrived at nearly 7:30PM, which is really pretty ridiculous. But the wait staff was very apologetic, and very good to us all night. The food was actually pretty good - I'd eat here again if I thought the wait wouldn't be so long. And to top it off, the manager knew about our issue and never came by once to say anything? It would have gone a long way with us had they made time to talk to us.",

    "text": "We must have arrived at Stuff'd restaurant's busiest time as all the tables and bar were occupied. Seating capacity was under 60. We were given the option of sitting on stools at a bar area that seated 4. Being excited to try this new restaurant - we accepted that seating arrangement. The area where we sat was a passing zone so traffic was great. We declined ordering from the bar and chose to share the new appetizer of Stuffed Banana Peppers. It was spicy as expected but somewhat cold thermally. We ordered the Mac & Cheese Pierogi and the Cheeseburger Pierogi entrees. As we waited, there was considerable turnover at the booths near our seating. People who came in after us in groups of 4 and 5 received their meals as we waited. Upon signaling our server, she apologized for the long wait and went to check on our order. We finally received our meals. My husband's Cheeseburger Pierogi (#6 boiled then sauteed) came on a bed of lettuce with sides of tomato and a pickle. There was a drizzle of sauce on the pierogis that tasted very much like Mickey D's special sauce. Overall, his meal was tasty. My Mac & Cheese Pierogis (#6 boiled then sauteed in butter with onions) were stuffed with elbow Mac and Cheese and placed upon a bed of what appeared to be Cheese Whiz. There were sides of sour cream as well as Sriracha sour cream. My Pierogis were quite flavorless except for the saltiness from the processed cheese. We optioned to share the Dessert Pie-rogi of #3 deep fried apple walnut \"dumplings\" with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream drizzled with caramel sauce. Once again, people came and went and we still waited for our dessert. Finally we summoned the server and told her to cancel our dessert order. She apologized again for the wait. As she was canceling our dessert order - it was brought to us. Our server had removed the dessert charge from our bill and urged us to enjoy the dessert. I acquiesced as my husband was presented with the bill. Then a second server/supervisor came over with our revised bill indicating a 50% discount on our bill (the Dessert charge had been completely removed). I do not plan a return visit to Stuff'd. BTW - I have Polish heritage so I was very excited to try this new restaurant and share a review with my friends near and far. I came away very disappointed in the service aspect but thought that the varieties of Pierogis offered appeared to be interesting. I was looking forward to trying them all during repeat visits. But that isn't happening.",

    "text": "Even after reading the reviews, I still had high hopes for this place. However, I was sadly mistaken and should have listened a little closer to others who have visited this restaurant. The concept is great, and has so much potential to be a great place to grab dinner downtown. They seemed to lack direction and maybe management? When I was first seated we were immediately told they were out of several menu items, and that they were having supply chain problems. We were also informed they were still waiting for things such as a coffee machine, iced teas, simple things that should have been cleared up within the first week or two of business. Now I understand they haven't been open very long, but long enough that they shouldn't have so many problems and be out of so many things. We placed our order for several different Pierogis, two side salads, and one order of fries. 40-50 minutes later we finally got our COLD food. I would call the meals luke warm at best. I mean even the fries were cool. The food was however pretty good, I'm sure they would taste excellent if they were nice and hot like you expect your food to be at a restaurant. Our waitress was very nice, but not very professional.  I really hope this place can turn it around or I fear they won't be around for too long. I can't say I'll be returning unless I hear that things have changed there.",

Ordered promptly. Waited over 30 minutes to see the table next to us (seated just before) served, looks and smells good. Waited another 10 minutes before we saw our food - had potato/cheese and the spinach/feta. Potato/cheese came with a mess of onions, the spinach/feta had very little stuffing.  Both were good - but not $12 and $14 good, respectively! Two servers were running between tables and the bar, watched plenty of people walk in, wait and walk out. While we were waiting on food, no one around us was eating either! Checks came immediately after the food (go figure) and then we had to flag her down to pay! Over an hour in and out for what was a mediocre meal and grossly overpriced. Service was abominable. Enter at your own risk, you won't catch me back there again.   Have since been chastised about giving them a chance, etc. but their initial launch was mid-August and they were easily open a month to \"work out the kinks\". At $14 a plate, they have bigger issues than kinks. Pierogis weren't even above ordinary. Check out the other reviews - you'll see glowing comments (likely friends/family) and then experiences just like mine. Oddly enough, the reviews on FB were removed.",

    "text": "Food was great, especially the pizza Pierogis. However, this was the worst service we have ever experienced. This place needs to get it's act together and have someone on staff who can manage the rest and teach them good customer service. Went on a Saturday around 7. The place was very crowded and had multiple groups waiting to be seated. There was no hostess to take names. Instead multiple workers continually asked how many people in each group. Seating was a debacle, and we were told multiple times that we'd be seated \"any minute.\" After any minute turned into many many minutes, my husband finally asked one of the workers how much longer since we'd been told the same thing multiple times. She proceeded to respond with an attitude, stating everyone seated is paying to be there and she had no idea how long it'd be. She then walked over to her coworkers, rolling her eyes and throwing nasty looks our way. Once we finally got seated, our waitress had an attitude as well. Every time we asked for something, such as a refill on water, or side of ranch, we were faced with rudeness as the waitress acted like we were a huge inconvenience. During dinner, people at the bar played a song on the jukebox that had foul language, asking a worker to turn it up. The worker turned it up so loud that we couldn't hear ourselves talk and multiple waitresses stood behind the bar, singing loudly with the customers. I felt like we were in a dance club. At the end of the dinner, the previously rude hostess/bartender began yelling at another coworker telling him people needed to do their jobs and using swear words. This made a scene and continued on, while another bartender told her to calm down. All of the workers were extremely unprofessional and unacceptable in the customer service business. I'm astounded that this place gets any business with how awful the service was but hope for the sake of the good food that they turn it around.",

    "text": "I've been to Stuff'd twice and both times they were out of quite a few times on the menu. The first time, I went on a Sunday for lunch with a friend. There wasn't many people in the restaurant and we sat right at the bar. We quickly noticed it seemed like the two waitresses on staff were entirely overwhelmed. Like I said, the place wasn't crowded but they could have used another person. Anyways - it took a while to get our drink orders in. I snuck mine past the bartender and she didnt even ask if my friend would like one. Once we went to order, they were out of my first THREE options. As a vegetarian I was stoked to see how many options there were on the menu - but alas, I had to settle for the Mac n Cheese Pierogies. They were fine, not worth the $14 or $16 paid for them though. While we were there, I saw one couple walk out once they realized their only option were the mac n cheese pierogies- they also said they were vegetarians.  My second experience went a little better. I went with a male friend, on a week night - which is maybe why we were paid attention to a little more? There was a different bartender that night and he was very friendly and happy. They were again out of my first choice (the sauerkraut pierogies) and he offered to do the traditional potato and cheese with a side of sauerkraut. The traditional were much better than the mac n cheese and the sauerkraut was amazing. It had a bit of horseradish-ey mayo mixed in? Not positive - but it was good.  All in all, its a nice restaurant - but I've gone twice and they've been out of many options. The pierogies are also about $2.50 a piece - which isn't astronomical but its something to think about considering the chances of you getting what you want are slim. The closest parking garage also has a $15 weekend/night base rate - so if you plan on going to Stuff'd on the weekend or for dinner, thats another cost to consider. It quickly turns into an expensive night - and its unfortunately not all that. *shrugs*",

We sat down and was told someone would be right with us, we waited no one came so we got up and got our own menu. Waitress finally comes over first thing she says is it'll be easier to tell you what we do have rather than what we dont have and gave us some sob story about how their freezer broke and blah blah. So we order 5 plates of different kinds of pierogies and so the waiting began. An hour goes by still no food just lots of promises that its coming. We never did get refills on drinks, finally threw down a $20 and was getting ready to walk out when a guy who claimed to be a manager says he'll check on our food. Another 10 minutes goes by and getting closer to game time we still had to walk to the stadium so we walked out. So disappointing!!

    "text": "My husband and I had three family members in town for the night from NY and CA and we thought we should take them for some authentic Pittsburgh pierogis. After calling Stuff'd multiple times to make a reservation and getting no answer (voicemail inbox was full), we thought to look for the restaurant's Facebook page, and saw a post there stating that their phone was out of order. Also, their FB page said they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more, anyway. We showed up at 6pm on a Saturday night for a party of five. The first thing we noticed was a high-top deuce with a big \"reserved\" sign on it (so much for only reserving for parties of 6 or more). After a few minutes, we were greeted at the door and seated. Several more minutes passed before the server came to our table. She told us that they were out of about half of the menu items: the reuben pierogis, the buffalo chicken pierogis, the chicken parm pierogis, the vegetarian pierogis, and a couple more. It didn't look that busy in there, but that was the excuse she gave for why the pierogi restaurant was nearly out of pierogis. She then disappeared for a while again. Eventually, we were able to place our order. My sister first ordered the pulled pork pierogis, but apparently in the meantime they had run out of those, too. Some of us ordered beer (the server did not seem familiar with the beer selections, and there was no printed drink list), and she had to check that they had what we wanted because several of the kegs had kicked, too. We then waited half an hour for our pierogis to arrive. When they did, my husband's order was not correct. He had ordered deep fried pierogis, but was served boiled pierogis instead - and then the server argued for a while that they were deep fried before admitting that she had made a mistake. Also, she had an extra plate of pierogis that none of us had ordered (maybe that's why they keep running out?), which she just gave to us. After serving our pierogis, she said \"oh, here's my boss\" and went outside to take pictures of a couple of guys on choppers while they loudly revved their engines right outside the door to the restaurant. Totally unprofessional! She also spent quite a bit of time chatting with the \"reserved\" deuce, who she said she was friends with (maybe that's why they were able to make a reservation despite the 6 people rule?), despite her claims about how weeded they were in there that night. The server did throw in one beer for free, which was literally the least she could possibly do to redeem herself. In short, the pierogis were good (not great, and we had to settle for whatever they actually had), and the service was pretty abysmal. Also, they were out of toilet paper in the men's room, and one of the sinks in the women's room was broken. It was really embarrassing that that's what our family will now associate with Pittsburgh restaurant service. I do not recommend Stuff'd.",

I will definitely be back to try more.",

    "text": "This place is awesome! Absolutely loved the decor. Our server Amber was great.  The pierogis were awesome. Everyone at our table (there were 6 of us) ordered a different type and we shared so that we could get a taste of 6 different ones. They have a few kinks to work out , but only opened a few months ago. One was that we tried to call ahead to make a reservation however their phones are not working. Hopefully they will get that problem fixed asap. The draft beer list is just written on a sheet of paper.  The menu is slightly misleading. it says you can order boiled or deep fried pierogis. We really didn't want either, we prefer them to be boiled then lightly browned in a frying pan instead of just boiled. We did not like the idea of deep fried either. However we were pleasantly surprised when we ordered the boiled and when they came out they were boiled but then lightly browned in the frying pan, just the way we like them!!  I think the menu should state that so you know what you will be served. We loved it there and will definitely go back again. I recommend this place to anyone that wants to try some unique pierogis!",

For those reasons it's getting 3 stars from me. I would probably go back again if I wasn't in a rush but it's definitely a meal you really have to be in the mood for!",

We were a group of 4 for lunch. They only had 1 server.  The place was empty.  That should've been the first tell.  After we got seated the  waitress talked to a friend who came into the restaurant for 15-20 mins before finally coming over to us only after we had said something.  She took our order and then we waited.     And waited..   15 mins to get our drinks.   40 mins to get our food.   My order was wrong, and everyone's  food was cold, and undercooked.  Took another 12 mins for them to bring me my food S they got it wrong the first time.  It was at least warm, but very undercooked.    TLDR I really wanted to like this place and have a great experience.  It's a cool concept and atmosphere.  But the service was some of the worst, and the food was was cold and undercooked.  I wouldn't wish this place on my enemies.",

There were tables that sat unbussed for the entire time we were there while they crowded six people into a table meant for four.  It was almost like they were fighting over who needed to clean the tables so no one did.  We were sitting at the bar but still couldn't get any service.  You had to ask for a refill every time or you were not going to get it.  The bartender wasn't even in the bar area half the time.    Now the food... We went specifically for the pierogies.  They were good but not as good as I had hoped.  I had the spring roll pierogies and really liked that sauce and stuff that came with them better than the pierogies themselves.  My husband had the macaroni and cheese pierogies and seemed to like them.  Despite the food being ok, I will probably not go back simply because of the service (or lack thereof).",

Each of us ordered a different pierogi dish and I will say that the portions were very generous. In fact, I probably could've shared one order and been fine. The pierogis weren't bad but I feel like they took something amazing (pierogis) and dressed them up to the point of ruining them. I'd take some Mrs. T's pierogis cooked with butter and onions in a frying pan over any of their crazy pierogi dishes any day.  I will say that the dessert pierogis that we ordered were very good. They contained a sweet creamy filling and were drizzled with strawberry sauce.",

So, despite the lack of positive feedback, we decided to try our luck anyway. I'm so glad we did. We were greeted immediately by the friendliest server who asked where we'd like to sit. We preferred a booth to a high top or the bar. The only open booth happened to be way in the back, where it sounded like someone else had sat in an earlier review, so I was a little apprehensive. Our server got our water right away, while we looked at the menu. She suggested that if we were ordering pierogies to get that order in before we made our cocktails selection, since they take a while. The cocktail menu is limited, but that was fine, it was a lively offering either way. Our food came out in a reasonable time and was delicious. We had great service and warm conversation. The food was great, by the way. I don't know when I'll be back in Pittsburgh, but I'll definitely come back here when I do.",

Come here if you want a nice light meal. Haha!  Ok, so this is no diet food but it's fun and tasty.  The menu was inventive. Portions are HUGE. There were three of us and we all are big eaters. We ordered four plates of pierogi to share and we definitely could have been full with three. There's also an option to split an order of six pierogies into two kinds @ 3 each. That might have also been a wise option. Next time.  In order of deliciousness, we had the sauerkraut & onion, chicken marsala, lobster mac & cheese, and vegetarian pierogies. We all agreed that the veggie one was the least tasty but we were happy to have some vegetables to at least pretend that we made an effort at a balanced meal.",

It did start to pick up a little around 7 though. There didn't seem to be too many tables that could fit larger parties, but they accommodate. Very nice ambiance and the tables are large.  My table ordered drinks to start - a red sangria and 2 blue moons. The sangria was delicious, served in a wine glass. The Blue Moons tasted a little off, like more citrus-y than usual, but not a big deal!  We ordered a plate of pierogis each so we could all taste a few different types. We got the peachy pulled pork pierogis, the taco pierogis, and the spring roll pierogis. The pulled pork and taco ones were a huge hit - stuffed with meat and then loaded with meat and toppings. I had the spring roll pierogis and the only issue I had with them was that they sat in the soy sauce. I think if you're able to ask for it on the side, I would. It sort of overpowers the pierogis. They weren't too spicy though and overall were good. The portions were a LOT larger than I expected. These are not your typical Mrs. T pierogis. These are twice the size and you get a ton of toppings. We each only ate about 3 of the 6 pierogis we had on our plates! (Yay leftovers!!)  Overall, I am looking forward to returning sometime soon to try the Reuben and Breakfast pierogis! Great service, great food, and easy to get to location!",

They were mostly warm, but definitely not hot and combined with the freezing air they got cold almost immediately.  I ordered the chicken parmesan pierogies and they would have been pretty meh even if they were hot.  They were covered in a marinara sauce and shredded chicken and they just weren't great. They weren't bad, but...  The one bright spot was that the service was pretty good. The place was empty-ish when I got there and filled up quickly so seating was tight.  I won't be back. Too much great food in Pittsburgh for meh pierogies.",

Service was decent and we were checked on but the server and the one guy working both had a little bit of an attitude. Not many smiles and didn't make us feel comfortable... the girl wasn't even there to get our check for us to receive her tip. There were only 3-4 tables in the joint so I don't know what she possible could have been doing besides fully attending her tables. Oh well! Food was still good.",

    "text": "I came to this cozy downtown establishment on a Friday night after a long evening work shift, and, well...it pains me to say it as a born and raised local pierogi lover, but I'm not in a rush to come back. This is due to a combination of staff and the food itself.  Let me be clear - I thought the food here was pretty good. When I was here I ordered one of their specials: a fried pierogi more or less stuffed with a thick lobster bisque. And this meal was good - unique and rich, but good! As good as it was, though, when I scanned the menu overall I thought things were a bit expensive for what was being offered. I'm not surprised - gotta pay that downtown rent somehow! But still, if I was just basing my review on the food, the pricing would move Stuff'd into a \"special occasion\" category for me.  The service, though...the service unfortunately nudged Stuff'd straight into the \"no thanks\" category. I was here on a pretty quiet Friday; there were empty tables everywhere. Despite this, not ONCE did a waitress or waiter come to my table. Instead, the poor bartender ran back and forth between his post and my table! He brought me a great drink, got my order to the kitchen, brought my order from the kitchen, and rang me out. I definitely tipped him well for doing double duty that night.  So yeah, it's a darn shame that a downtown Pittsburgh eatery didn't deliver on the amazing concept that is a pierogi bar. But while their prices and service have scared me off for the time being, at least this city isn't lacking in markets and eateries that also sell our favorite food!",

The desserts are delicious, particularly the strawberry cheesecake Pierogi. The drinks are great with many variety. Everyone likes their drinks as well. You can also get creative with your drink. The customer service was exceptional. Our group was there to celebrate a day of winning in our girls volleyball national tournament. They toasted us with two bottles of champagne.

After the show we picked it up. It was supposed to be refrigerated- but wasn't. It was out on the counter. Once home, my husband opened his chicken sandwich to find that the top bun had a big chunk out of it. The bottom bun was broken in half.  None of this is acceptable.

    "text": "I happened to be downtown for work attending a convention with an associate.  We wondered out to get a bite to eat when oh no, it becomes clear.  My associate has the palate of a picky child.  I made suggestion after suggestion to be shut down.  He wants Primanti's.  I said if you want that you can go alone.   After walking out of another place because he wouldn't eat anything on the menu, we ended up here, mostly based on defeat as there were so many other places I would have preferred but hey I like pierogis so let's give it a try.    Disappointing is really the only thing I can say about my meal and experience.  We walked into a nearly empty restaurant.  In other words I saw more employees than customers and that was the case throughout our hour and 20 minute lunch.  No we didn't take that long to eat, or got carried away in conversation.  We waited over 40 minutes for our lunches to be served.  More on that to come.  Once seated we are given menus, water is brought and then we are asked for drinks.  As I looked over the menu it hit me that this place was pretty pricey.  Several different \"styles\" of pierogis but even the most basic (potato and cheese) ones were $12.00 for 6.  You know it's just dough.  Some of the more elaborate styles like buffalo chicken or cheese burger were upwards $16-$18.  There was at least one kind that was over $20.  Call me crazy but that's a lot to spend on lunch, and on pierogis, but that's just my opinion.  They do offer half plates.  I opted for a Pittsburgh salad it came with chicken and two fried pierogis.  I asked for boiled instead of fried.  My picky lunch partner ordered a sandwich and half a serving of pierogis.    So  we waited, and waited, and waited.  At some point I started to look around the joint noticing no one was there.  No one. What's taking so long?  This is not an off hour we went over lunch a little after 12, so where are all the people and where is our food?    At around the 45 minute marker I see a man (not our server) and get his attention which even though this place was dead was not easy.  I think he was trying to avoid me.  I tell him it's been over 40 minutes he said he will check.  So about 5 minutes later our server emerges from the basement carrying our food.  She sets everything down and brings refills and leaves.  Well my pierogis were fried and not boiled as I requested but at this point I waited long enough.  She served them on the side and brought cups of sauteed onions (which were cloyingly sweet) and shredded cheese.  However, my lunch partners pierogis were dressed(sitting under a bed of onions, sour cream, and cheese).    The salad was standard salad.  Nothing special there.  Chicken was a little tough but they had a nice array of toppings.  It was also a little pricey at $14.00.  The pierogis which I was most looking forward to were just so, so hard.  I tried cutting them with a knife and the pressure of the knife just pushed the filling out of the sides.  If your forte is pierogis then these should be some darn good ones!  They were not prepared well at all.  I will say the potato filling was very creamy but both myself and my associate were underwhelmed with their specialty.    All considered, the mediocre food did not justify the elevated pricing. Throw in the extensive wait with no real justification I would not recommend this establishment or return.  I could only imagine how frustrating this would be for someone on a time limited lunch, you know like most people coming here throughout the week.",

    "text": "Terrible experience due to PISS POOR management.  I've worked in the food industry for 10 years now and I'm extremely understanding in this setting for that very reason. January 20th, 2018 we stopped in after World of Wheels after walking looking for a bite to eat, there was 3 of us, we didn't leave for about 2 and a half hours after walking in.  The manager told us it would be roughly 6 minutes to sit. We waited 10 and then grabbed a drink from the bar, it took us 50 minutes to be sat.  We were highly irritated but never complained.  Once we sat it took about 10 minutes to order, we all got the four course meal. The first round was salad or fries, fries were cold but we were starving so we didn't complain.  Second round was stuffed peppers, phenomenal. The third round was the main dish, pierogies of your choice.  Food was excellent, service wasn't very good but the server who had tables near by noticed and refilled drinks on the house.  Once we ate we were waiting for our server to order the fourth course dessert, she never came.  We went elsewhere for our check. When the server came by she took the check and we asked for our cheesecakes to go.  We never got them but she brought back the check.  We managed to get the managers attention to tell him about how we still hadn't received our dessert, he noticed we had paid and said \"You guys weren't supposed to get a check, i'll be right back with your desserts.\" Roughly 5-10 minutes go by and we decided we'd had enough, we weren't waiting any longer so we got up to walk out where the manager was just standing near the bar.  When he seen us leaving he just started shaking his head. 90 dollar tab, we tipped 20.  Food was great apart from being cold, service was bad (apart from random server near by who was delightful) and the management was just awful. We loved the atmosphere and food selections but because of their treatment we will not return.",

We went for lunch on a weekday, and when we walked in around 11:45 there were only a few people seated. We ordered and waited about 25 minutes with no one coming to check on us. About 20 minutes after that, we went to ask a server for an update on our food and she said she would check on it. Our server never returned and finally, an hour after being seated, we decided to leave with no food. Nobody, over the course of the entire hour, came to check on us, apologize, or give us an update on our food. As we were leaving, our server ran up and offered to have our food boxed for us to go. We decided to do that, and as previously mentioned, the food was pretty good. The downside: we couldn't enjoy it together and had to eat it separately back at the office.",

I fell in love with the food the first time I went, but we had to scarf it down because we planned to have dinner before seeing a show. I gave them the benefit of the doubt bc it was fairly new and maybe they were working out glitches. However, I've been back twice since then and it still continues to be a problem. We arrived an hour and a half before show time, with a reservation. Luckily, no one was there (they've probably caught on to the fact you have to dine and dash to get to your show), but we were still scarfing our food down after waiting 65 minutes. During those 65 minutes we had one drink a piece, were never asked if we'd like another (which at $12 a drink The wait staff should be asking to refill often bc they're making bank on those). For the extent of their bar (probably have $15,000 in liquor behind the bar), the wine selection was pitiful. We had to ask several times where our food was - keep in mind it wasn't crowded. There were ample people working for the number of tables occupied, and we were there to spend money, yet no one paid us a bother (except Nick the bartender who is leaving after his next shift). It makes what is intended to be an enjoyable girls night out very stressful. I do not know how they stay in business with the service and wait times, their product is amazing and they are sitting on a gold mine and don't even realize it. Please someone help the pierogie bar to better function!! I can see the potential, but they need help!",

It is amazing to me how poorly managed! Every employee seems to be armed with their  cell phone in their back pocket because that was their primary focus. The two tables by the front door sat with leftover food on it for 35 minutes before it was ever touched as people were in line waiting to get in the place.  I wanted to warn them to turn around it would be the worst waste of one hour of their lives.  This place has charm and decor but there can't be a manager that has any intelligence whatsoever running this place.  I want this place to succeed but how in the world could an owner hire people that have no clue how to manage a business?  It is beyond my belief that you could possibly run a business this poorly? The service is slow inefficient poor and again how can you leave tables with dirty food and dishes ? When we finally got our food we asked for the check and paid immediately because we knew would be 15 minutes before the waiter would return to our table and we didn't want to miss kick off.",

Their signature and most basic menu item, potato and cheese pierogies, were either Mrs. T's or an inferior version of Mrs. T's.  And the kitchen didn't even heat them properly.  They came ice-cold in the middle.  I sent them back.  20 minutes later, new ones came that were frozen in the middle.  I gave up.  With the bar so high for new restaurants downtown, with the costs so high for opening a new restaurant -- what are these guys thinking?!!!",

    "text": "My first time in Pittsburgh and I knew I had to try pierogis! On a quick google map search, my friend found this place was super close to where we were (Andy Warhol Museum) and had great reviews. If you're at the AW Museum, this is a quick walk over the Andy Warhol Bridge (which also gives gorgeous views of the city)!   We came in at 3pm. It wasn't very busy at all and we were seated right away. My friends and I took awhile looking through the menu and didn't know what we had wanted when our waitress first asked. However, she didn't come back to ask us about our order for at least 20 minutes! I'm not sure what happened, but the people around us who came in after us with a different waitress got their order in and food out way before we did. By the time we got our food it was 3:45pm.   The pierogis were delicious however! It almost made up for the long time we spent just waiting. I got the mac & cheese pierogis, which were delicious! But they are extremely filling! You get 6 pierogis, which may not sound like a lot, but this place lives up to its name! They're stuffed and huge!!! My friend who got classic potato pierogis was the only one able to finish all her food. I would recommend one of the heavier pierogis if someone at home will eat the leftovers same day because I don't think most people could finish these and they might get soggy after awhile. None of this detracts from how delicious they were though! Also, they have a great selection of vegetarian pierogis.  I also couldn't help but notice how this painting at my table was hung.....why would you hang it like this....",

The fancy ones are nice, but the basic potato and cheese version is to die for! The caramelized onions are so sweet that you have to try them to believe them. Absolute perfection. The staff are phenomenal! The bartender went went through the menu and made sure I got exactly what I wanted. She was so kind to us and the food was so good, that I actually made a return trip on the last day of our work trip to have one more plate of potato magic and make sure that it was not a one off fluke. I'm glad I did, it was just as amazing on the second try.   All my friends in PGH told me to this was the spot to be, even though most hadn't tried it yet. I'm excited to report back to them that they need to stop in.   Thanks for making my trip back to one of my favorite cities a great foodie experience.",

Didn't get my food until 5:00. (There was not that many people there.) food was burnt and cold like it was sitting underneath the heat lamps for an eternity. The one set of rogies was just the traditional and the cheese wasn't anywhere close to being melted. I rarely voice my displeasure but I thought this was exceptionally bad. The manager came over and pretty much told us that's how they normally roll and we should've expected shabby service all around.   This is the only restaurant in Pittsburgh that I will go out of my way to tell people not to waist their time or money here.  I feel most of my reviews are positive, so if you still go here after reading this.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.    0/5 Not worth it my guy.",

All of our dishes were dry and over cooked . I had great expectations for this place and was disappointed at the quality.

    "text": "I have to say how terribly disappointed I was. Pierogis are one of my favorite Pittsburgh foods and when I saw this place I couldn't wait to stop in.   We walked in and were seated promptly at a booth in the back corner. (It's important to note the booths have very tall backs.) It took about 10 minutes for anyone to come over and check on us to get our server. By the time our server actually stopped by we were ready to order and she wasn't prepared to take it. After she went to grab her book, we finally got to place our order. We ordered the traditional potato and cheese, sweet cabbage, Mac and cheese, and sauerkraut on the side.   We waited about 25 minutes to get our food. The pierogis came out extra crispy (read: burnt and over cooked). The silverware was having a tough time cutting through the pierogi as they had gotten so tough from being over cooked (both overboiled and burnt on the grill). The Mac and Cheese pierogi were incredibly dry on the inside (seemed to lack cheese on the inside) and had an uncooked crumb topping. The sauerkraut, which they forgot to bring out to me and got about half way through eating, had been put on the grill and was riddled with burnt pieces. The grille needed to be cleaned. The onions were about the only item that was cooked well, nicely caramelized. The server never came back until we were ready for the check to see if we were okay or needed more to drink.   The restaurant itself was small but nice in appearance. Seating options included bar, high tops, or booths. Overall, the experience was less than expected and both service and quality of the food could use major improvement.",

The Rueben pickle was interesting. I felt like it was missing sauerkraut and could use some warmed up meat and cheese. The Big Mac pierogies were tasty and I would recommend giving them a shot to anyone. The jalapeno pickle pierogies on the other hand were sort of gross... mostly because they weren't really cooked. They had very thick dough that was barely cooked, thus the stuffing was cold. I would probably give the actual restaurant a chance, but I would not go out of my way to make that happen.",

    "text": "It was late and we hadn't eaten yet, so we went in search of a place that would allow for a late dinner.  We are that typical couple that just can't figure out where to go to eat.  We headed toward Downtown knowing that there would be plenty of places to choose from.  We stumbled upon this gem of a place.  We checked the menu in the window before we made sure this was where we wanted to go.  Everything looked wonderful the way they were described.  Just to clarify for me, pierogies are little pocket filled pillows of life.  Especially when there are made fresh.  When we walked in we were told to sit wherever we wanted and menus would be brought to us.  We opted for a booth toward the back, away from the noise at the bar.  Shortly after we sat down we had menus in hand.  We placed our drink orders and went over the menu.  My eye kept getting caught by two items on the menus, making it harder than it should have been.  I went between the traditional Potato and Cheese and the Mac and Cheese.  I just kept going back and forth over and over again.  Funny thing was that my better half kept going back and forth with the same ones.  We made a compromise, I would order the Mac and Cheese and he would order the Potato and Cheese and we would share them.  Order placed and we just waited.  Besides the obvious differences with the filling the only difference between the two is the sauce on the side.  Sour cream for the Potato and Cheese and Sriracha Sour Cream for the Mac and Cheese.    Both variety of pierogi were amazing.  The Potato and Cheese were not too heavy, filled with the right amount of filling.  Pan fried was the appropriate way to go about these ones.  Flavor trapped in the pasta part mixed well with the ingredients enveloped inside.  The Mac and Cheese ones were amply stuffed.  Not your typical pierogi but totally worth a try.  The mac and cheese was the right consistency.  More cheesy than I expected and allowing for a very flavor filled bite.  The only miss here is the Sriracha Sour Cream.  To me it did not mix well.    We could not finish these so we took them to go when we could not fit anymore in our stomachs.  They made for a great meal later.",

Place our order, and After about 40 minutes we decided to ask the waitress if our food was close to coming out .  She decided to walk back to the kitchen and came out and told us it is on its way out.  After 15 more minutes there was no food and a puzzled waitress saying that she thought it was on her way out.    At this point we reach the hunger limit for a day and a threshold for common sense , so we decided to walk away from the failed investment we call an experience at the pierogies shop .   I would like to give a review on the food but unfortunately we didn't make it that far in a restaurant experienced",

The breakfast, traditional, sweet cabbage, Reuben, pizza, chicken parm..  I mean making Pierogi is their art and they take it seriously.  They are large and delish!  Our waitress Kat was spectacular, she really knew her stuff and made it a great evening.  The misses of the evening were small but obvious - their red sauce is very pasty and takes away from the delivery of the food and the the when you get your wine some times it comes served in a wine glass, bar glass, but never the same glass twice.  Pretty amateur.  But the pierogis were amazing.  Come for them!",

While it's not as close to my work as I would have liked I thought it sounded pretty good so I made the trek there.  We sat at the bar when we got there. There are mostly high top tables and the bar seemed the best place to get served and to hang out.   The menu is pretty extensive. It was hard to just pick one kind. I ended up picking the pulled pork and the veggie. I also got a side basket of fries because ... fries are delish.  So, the pierogies took a bit to come out. And they were a bit chilly when I finally got them. While they weren't cold, cold, they weren't hot. That would be my only complaint.   The pulled pork tasted great. The sauce and the amount of meat was, yum. I was able to take half back to my co-workers and they loved them.   The veggies were so good that I ate them all in that sitting. Really good filling and the sauteed veggies were on point.  I want to come here again, I just hope the temperature is better!! The food was good. And I'm willing to trek out to try it again.",

Being acknowledged to get a table was a bit challenging, took 5 minutes for anyone to greet is even though you're literally 2 feet from the bar.  But we did get sat.   Waitress was nice and kept up with our orders, letting us know when things were behind and how food was coming along.   The food was EXCELLENT, peach bbq pierogi and Reuben pierogi's were awesome.  We got loaded fries as an appetizer and highly recommend.    Overall, food was great, but don't be in a hurry.  Gotta have it at least once, especially since pierogi's are a delicacy in this part of PA.",

They are located right next to the Benedum center so you'd imagine they are used to handling crowds and have a fast service well they don't!  I ordered two chicken tenders and fries for my children thinking it would be fast to make and so they could get something to eat before we headed to see the show.  We waited more than an hour and left without food because the waitress told us it would take another 15 mn.  Sorry to say, the place wasn't that busy and other customers were not getting food either.   My advice to the chef, go back to school or go work the line in a restaurant and see how it's done!!!",

They said 10 more mins. 30 mins later and still no one came back over I went and asked the server about our food. He said he saw it on the grill. I asked for an ETA. He went to the kitchen and came back to tell us he cancelled our order 20 minutes ago. He said they were too busy tonight. We were 1 of 3 tables.  We asked to speak to the manager and he said she was too busy. We asked to find her and he said he couldn't. He took my information and we left after 2 hours of being there and never getting served.

It was around 4pm on Sunday and when we walked in, there was nobody in the restaurant which made us a little nervous. By the time we ordered and ate, the place was completely packed. We each decided to order a different type of pierogie and then share with each other since there were so many good options. Every entree comes with 6 huge pierogies and the different toppings. We had lobster mac and cheese, peach bbq pulled pork and chicken marsala. The group favorite was hands down the peach bbq pulled pork - it was fantastic! All the pierogies were very good and our waiter was a super nice guy. I would definitely return if I am in the area.",

Party at a table next to the line at the host stand were bundled in their coats and I overheard on person at this table talking about being \"hangry.\"  They had no drinks or food on their table.  Bartenders were dressed in hoodies and knit caps so you know it was cold in there.  Waited a few minutes and one party in front of us left.  We waited another 5-10 minutes.  Not one employee was seen other than the two bartenders who did not make eye contact with all the people waiting to be seated.  We decided to leave, and the people that were first in line said they had been waiting 15 minutes with no one coming to greet them.  They summed it up perfectly - \"If they had just told us they couldn't accommodate us, it would have been fine.  But they didn't.\"  As I'm writing this on a desktop computer, I glance to my right and see another review where they experienced the same thing but a month earlier.  Who is in charge of this restaurant? Obviously this person has no pride in their work or their reputation.  This was our first -- and last -- visit.",

There was a split on the favorite....My husband was a HUGE fan of the Cheeseburger one...I however was in LOVE with the buffalo chicken ones.  If I had to find a least favorite I would say you could pass up the Mac n Cheese ones....and the dessert ones still need a little tweaking.....But man ol man I am glad we didn't live closer cause I would be here all the Time.

However, even giving this place the benefit of doubt it is downright AWFUL. On multiple occasions I've experienced this. I stood at the door when the entire restaurant was empty for 15 minutes waiting for a table. The servers talk loudly about inappropriate things. My food has been cold on multiplier occasions. You cannot order over the phone because they NEVER answer it. It's a real shame because the food is good or has potential to be good. Maybe if it were under different ownership or something.

Honestly, the buffalo chicken on the salad was better than the pierogies.  It didn't seem like there was any buffalo chicken sauce in the pierogies.  Anyway, we weren't offered anything other than water and it took a really long time for us to get our food.  We were there for about an hour and a half.  If you are a restaurant downtown, you should realize that people are on their lunch breaks and need to be in and out.  Also, remember, the reataurant was pretty empty.

There was a single bartender serving the entire restaurant...seating people, taking orders, serving and bussing tables.   Speaking to him when I paid the bill, he was also responsible for putting sauces on dishes, and  bringing them up from the downstairs kitchen   Needless to say, this poor guy was overwhelmed, resulting in horrible service.   The food itself was decent, but not great.  The consensus was that it likely was under heat lamps too long or perhaps the kitchen was equally understaffed. In total, our meal took 2 hours from start to finish....hardly a good idea for lunch.  In conclusion...a good concept, a good menu, but terrible execution due to understaffing.",

Who doesn't like the idea of pierogies stuffed in all things bad for you...and then pan- or deep-fried, right? From the moment we entered and the bartender/manager/aka PT-chef-when-hell-breaks-out-in-the-kitchen yelled at the servers for placing a party of 3 at a table for 6, and our group of 6 at two high-top rounds (which never works well). Nonetheless, we settled in, ordered our food, and 50 (yes, FIFTY) minutes later - NOTHING had come out of the kitchen but excuses and apologies (with no food in sight). No joke. We had to call it a day, left Stuff'd hungry, stopped at Sienna Mercato and 30 minutes later ordered, ate, AND paid. Ba da boom! Sorry, Stuff'd, but we won't be back soon...or ever probably.",

All four of us ordered a different pierogi entree so we could share. We weren't at all disappointed by any of the options and were pleasantly surprised given the reviews.  I can agree the service here may not be the best, but I wouldn't complain about it either. Average. And they do run out of things, which can be a disappointment, especially when they are out of seasonal items and don't update the menu. That's my biggest reason for 4 stars--update the menu when you're done serving a certain cocktail or menu item.   Overall, I would go back but this won't be at the top of my list.",

So after waiting a few minutes the only server working there and came to seat us. She sat us in this booth in the very back corner and where there was no lights and it smelled like mold so bad. So when our server, Sheena, finally came over to get our order, we moved to a better booth, then we all ordered our kinds of perogies and we requested them to be boiled. It took the food 1 hour to come out. It was so long we had to go back and pay on our parking meter so we wouldn't get a ticket. When our food finally came out, our perogies were crispy and seemed fried and harder than a rock. When we asked sheena why our perogies were this way when we requested them to be boiled, she yelled at us saying they were boiled and they were pan seared too. The service was lousy, our server was rude and yelled at us, and the perogies sucked. We will never, ever be back.",

We both work in the food service industry and completely understand everyone had those days or shifts but customer service has never been something We wouldn't let slip to the side.

The bartenders wore skin tight leggings without undergarments, they were rude, one of them wiped her nose with her hand on a continuous basis, they took my glass and got ice from the bin using the glass they served me in... They immediately told us upon sitting down that there would be no food because the ticket machine didn't work. Not sure if they ever heard of a pen and pencil. I was only in the place 1 minute and knew I would not be eating there anyway so that point was moot! It took 15 minutes of being ignored before finally our drink was given to us. A bottle of beer and a glass of wine and a glass of water was not that complex. They bitched about the crowd, they bitched about each other, and they bitched about how hard it was to work there ....out loud. It was most uncomfortable cocktail of my life. And might I add again the entire time I got to watch women wearing light colored leggings with no undergarments! Classless place",

Upon entering, the place was kind of busy (take that with a grain of salt because the place is not that big), and the hostess didn't even acknowledge us for 5 minutes while we stood there. After getting seated, we had plenty of time to look at the place because our server didn't show up for a long while either. We were seated underneath an air vent that looked like it hadn't been cleaned since before they opened-dust was just CAKED on. The sinks in the bathrooms looked nice, but the soap dispensers were torn off the wall and just sitting on the counters. The whole restaurant looks like they tried to go with a vintage industrial kind of thing, but it looks like slopped together garbage, just like the food.  We ordered the buffalo chicken and the pulled pork Pierogi both boiled and then sauteed. They came out looking pretty sad, drowned in their \"drizzle\" of sauce. Any kind of sear they had from the saute was quickly diminished under the slosh of way too much sauce on both of the dishes. The buffalo chicken was awful. Not sure what kind of hot sauce they use, but it tasted cheap and vinegary, just like Franks, which is pretty sad because that is literally all you could taste even after trying to scrape them clean. The same could be said for the bbq, and the coleslaw they serve on the side is just plain nasty.  The only redeeming thing is the portion size. Those Pierogi are huge and served 6 to an order. If you could find an option that they didn't slather in sauce, the price of this place might be worth it. For us, we won't be back.",

Five minutes spent staring at the \"Please wait to be seated\" sign before they told us to sit anywhere we liked. 10 minutes to get our drink orders taken. No heat. The pierogies weren't really \"stuff'd\" with much, and I don't think it was worth the price paid.",

The place eventually filled up and those tables were served and left before we could get a second beer, let alone our food. We ended up waiting over an hour to get our food. The waitress continuously blamed the kitchen without giving a specific reason for the wait. I blame the fact that she disappeared for quite some time. She did us a solid by giving 10% off our bill...insert sarcasm. The only reason I gave this place a second star was because the Pierogies were amazing.",

The ambience is blah overall and the staff doesn't seem too into being there either.. Might have gave 3 stars until I realized I was drinking an expired beer. Ugh.

    "text": "This place is very underrated (three yelp stars at time of writing). I showed up 3 weeks after their soft opening and granted they are having supply chain problems, but the Pierogi here are, as the kids would say, Dank af. Some of the best pierogi I have ever had. I would highly recommend this place. If they had been fully stocked and the menu was all hits with no misses I would definitely give five stars.   Deeper opinions: Call me old fashioned but boiled pierogi are far better than the deepfried. The boiled get pan fried after the fact (the waitress was very knowledgeable about their processes) and they end up being vastly supperior. So don't be afraid to trust in the Polish wisdom. I got sweet cabbage boiled and they were probably the best pierogie I have ever had. So if you try to go decadent with deep-fried cheeseburger and you are underwhelmed I have no sympathy for you. Since I was part of a big party, I also tried the greek, the standard, and the mac and cheese. Across the board solid but every time better boiled than fried.  They also have a fine selection of sauces.   Finally, Pie-rogie dessert? If you're like me, you're powerless to food pun portmanteaus. Fantastic, basically little pies but I dare you to be sad when eating a little pie.   I hope this place gets the chance it deserves to work out the kinks because they know how to cook em, and when it comes down to it, If that ain't the most important part of a restaurant, I don't know what is.",

For dinner I ended up picking the buffalo chicken pierogies, but this dish wasn't my first choice.  There was a great variety of pierogies, but when the waitress came over the first thing she did was to go through a list of what they were out of, which was a few beers, a few mixed drinks, and 4 of their pierogie types.  Of course the 3 pierogies I was already debating between were all on the list of what they were out of.  Honestly I was thinking 6 pierogies wasn't going to be enough, but they were filling.  I was able to squeeze some room for dessert.  The cherry cheesecake pierogies were delicious and my favorite part of the meal.  Overall the pace of the meal was very slow too for there only being 2 tables seated.  This is a great concept restaurant for Pittsburgh, but just didn't hit the mark for me.  I can see bringing out of town guests here though.",

First off, its basically the same interior as the previous Grille on Seventh, but with a few new things on the wall. We went in for lunch and there was no one else in the place. I think we say 4 patrons the whole time.   I ordered the Reuben and my coworker for the buffalo chicken in salad form (you get 3 pierogies on the salad and 6 as the entree) We also ordered a side of fries. Initially I was like mm this is pretty good. My coworker tried it and he was like yeah its good but it tastes EXACTLY like a Reuben. I know usually I'd be like oh awesome I like Reubens and it tastes the same, but in reality, it didn't taste anything like a pierogi. They even gave me the marble rye bread. All I tasted was a reuben with a little bit of crunch because I got the pierogies fried. Maybe there needed to be some potato in the pierogies along with the corned beef. Because why would I pay $16 for pierogies that taste exactly like a reuben when I can get a real reuben for less than that. It was the same with my coworkers. It really just tasted like buffalo chicken dip on a salad. It was good, just missing the pierogi mark.   It wasn't a bad experience, I just feel like if its going to be a pierogi bar, I want my entree to taste like pierogies as well as whatever they are  trying to use as a flavor.",

When asked on the wait time, we were told the food would be out soon. Another half hour goes by. At this point we are ravenous and ready to walk to McDonalds when the food finally arrived. Was it worth the wait? No, one order of pierogies was burnt, one was luke warm, and the other hardly cooked. The waitress brought us a manager who immediately became defensive when presented with our concerns. She even went so far as to tell us the blackened food just had \"a little more color\" than most. After all of this she discounted our food only 15%. We arriving at 3:50 pm we never left until 5:50.",

No wait at the door. No warning of this when we sat down. Weary and hungry this was our first destination for Pittsburg food, our first time in the city. We were planning on getting a bite here and at several other Pittsburgh establishments, but the food took so long that we weren't able to do that. When we asked a manager to come over that was another 20 minute wait. We intended to ask how quickly we might order more but Manager Heather arrived with a rude attitude, biting sarcasm, and a quick promise to take 20% off our bill then ran away without even asking us how our meal was. (Answer- chicken parm was delicious, Mac n cheese came out cold, peach bbq was just ok). She changed her mind and took $3 off a $65 check then hid in the back of the house till we left. This place would do well to get rid of Heather and tell diners food will come out as it's ready. Had we known we would have ordered more or made this our final destination.",

They have a full bar and a small selection of draft beers. We walked right in and sat at the bar. The place did not appear busy with many bar seats & tables empty. It took a while for the bartender to even say hello let alone ask what we would like. After we finally were able to order food our glasses sat empty for another while. It was just plain ole terrible service combined with a total lack of personality from those behind the bar. When the food finally made it out our drinks were refilled for the final time. My food, although flavorful, was only warm at best. I ordered \"pan fried\" Pierogis and they appeared to have just thrown into a pan without any type of oil/butter and arrived with a dry exterior - not how I would expect a Pierogi to be fried. We only managed to get two drinks refilled in the more than 90 minutes we were sitting at the bar. Overall terrible & unapologetic service and a lack of engagement from the bar staff. Even though the food was OK, this experience will definitely keep me from returning. Not sure I would recommend this one, there are too many better options downtown Pittsburgh.",

I thought about turning around, but the engaging staff and the smell of the food kept me inside. I even gave the bartender a pair of hand warmers. I ordered a couple of my traditional favorites: sauerkraut and potato and cheese. If these were messed up, there would be no reason to try anything else.  The food came out quickly and, in spite of the bar's internal temperature, was hot! There was plenty to eat...pierogies were a good size, cooked in butter and onions and topped with sauerkraut. My initial bite caught the flavor of the onions, butter, sauerkraut and the delicate dough. Each had the same amount of filling - seasoned perfectly. The pierogies were amazing! I have to give the staff credit for toughing it out when they could have easily closed.   I've got a trip to Pittsburgh coming up in a few weeks and can't wait to get back to try a few of their specialty pierogies.  This place is certainly worth the trip.",

Upon entering, it was slow and there were not many patrons. It was about 530, so it was hit or miss on how busy it would be. The server/hostess met me at the door and seated me in the back. It's not a terribly large place but has a nice sized bar.  I waited about 15 mins for my friend to arrive, and it was not until right before she arrived did they ask if i would like anything while I wait. It didn't take long for us to order food and have it placed, however it did take over 45 mins for the food to come out. The restaurant did become busier as time went on and filled up pretty quickly. Our orders were placed long before it got crowded, and it still took a considerably long time for the food to come out. A few other tables that arrived after us got their food prior to ours. When it did finally come, I was missing the pierogis on top of my salad, which they fixed quickly and without question. The food was good, but I wasn't overly impressed. I ordered a side salad with a plan pierogi and a half order of the Spring Roll pierogis (yes, you can order a half order of three rather than the usual six). They were tasty and filling, but the staff were very poor. They did not check back in with us, there was only one waiter for the whole place with another woman assisting him, and several other tables were agitated about waiting over an hour for food. While the staff was not rude, they just appeared busy and not able to attend to people as the should.  If you don't mind waiting and want to try some fun types of pierogis, it might be worth checking out.",

She had no dinner at this point because ordering something else would have taken another 90 minutes!! The female bartender was blatantly rude, rolled her eyes and was obviously bothered that we asked her for our check (we had to ask her because our waiter never returned after bringing our food, 45 minutes later!) When one of the couples paid her and they waited for their change, she asked what they were waiting on and when they responded with \"our change\", her response was \"are you serious?\"  She assumed their change was automatically going to be her tip!
