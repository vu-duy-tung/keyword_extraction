It was nice being able to sit on the second story and people watch. The food came out really fast and for $8, you get a good amount of food. The bulgogi was flavorful and the katsu was cut into small sized strips. I think it was a good fusion between japanese presentation and korean food. There's a lot of things I wanted to try on the menu, so when I come back, I definitely would like to try the bulgogi bibimbab!",

The salad is usually romaine hearts with sesame paste based sauce. The portion of a bento is more than enough for me even when I'm hungry. I tried the beef soup once and it was good too.   My friend ordered sushi and shared with me. It's rolled sushi with sashimi on top, which I like better than nigiri.   They don't have much of sitting space, but I never had problems finding seats on the second floor.",

I also tried their sushi (ocean roll), while it didn't look any different from grocery store rolls. It tasted amazing. Super fresh and lpts of flavor.

Would I go back to Oishii Bento if I could go to Sushi and Rolls prehaps no?  The roll was mostly rice with some pale orange mayo....that was not very tasty.  The roll was mostly avocado and I couldn't taste my tuna with my mouth full of avocado.  The avocado may have been listed in the discription of the roll and I could have over looked it.  I just wanted more fish and a lot less avocado.   I did like that the menu is mounted on the wall and it's three vertical flat screens, that was a nice touch.  I just wasn't too happy with my sushi lunch, I'd rather add an extra $4.00 and get something worthwhile somewhere else.",

    "text": "Small and comfortable Asian fusion place that serves a variety of signature Korean and Japanese dishes. Their menu includes sushi, different Korean meat \"bowls\" (small, under $10) and \"bentos\" (larger, over $10), appetizers, and noodles like udon.   The food itself is quite good, despite not really having the feeling of an authentic Korean or Japanese meal. I've had the bulgogi, spicy pork, and bibimbap, and each had a good combination of ingredients and sauces. The bulgogi and spicy pork bowl only comes with onions and mushrooms for vegetables, but both have a fair portion of meat; I've found the spiciness level of the pork to vary. The bibimbap is a fair replication of the more traditional dish which comes and is made in a stone bowl. They also serve galbi, terikayi, and katsu dishes.  The ambience is set up for efficiency (probably catering to the students). You order at the counter and you wait maybe up to 10 minutes for your food, at which point you can take it upstairs and hope that there's seating, which may sometimes be lacking during busy hours. On the bright side, there's no need to tip!",

But the place has plenty of customers which is a good sign. The katau don was ok, but without the rich tasty brown gravy thy i am used to also the pork was a bit bland.   The sushi was good, but the tuna and salmon was previously frozen it seemed. Which was only noticeable because of how cold it was.  The eel was the best I have had in quite awhile. Also the sushi was hard to eat since the rice kept falling apart.   All in all, a decent spot, but they has allot of work to so to catch up with Korea Town in NYC",

I frequently order the bento boxes, specifically the spicy pork bento and chicken katsu. The katsu is sometimes as dry and rough as the chopsticks you're eating it with, but it varies every time I go. The vegetable udon and gyoza that come with the bento are all really good. For me, the bento is enough for about 1.5 meals, but I also eat very little so I can see some people complaining about the quantity of food--back at home, I'd order bento from H-Mart for about the same price and it would come with much more of everything. I've also had the spicy pork bowl, which was good but not as flavorful as I expected it to be. It was definitely spicy, but not much else.  I still really like Oishii because it's probably one of the best places to go for Asian food in the area. Service is quick and staff are friendly.",

I say this since I ate here as a student a couple times, and I remember not being super impressed by the sushi and thinking that one of the bowls I ordered wasn't that great. There just wasn't a lot of flavor or freshness in any of the meals I got back then.  These days the sushi at least is massively improved in my book. I picked up their Caterpillar roll and Red Heat roll to go recently and really liked both. The fish was of a reasonable quality even if it wasn't the freshest fish ever, and the topping and sauce combinations in both rolls were pretty tasty too. So while Oishii wouldn't make my admittedly snobbish list of the top 5 best sushi places, I do think they now offer reasonable and fairly tasty sushi options.   Something I appreciate now that hasn't changed since I was a student is the prices. My latest meal cost a bit more than usual here but hey, I ordered two of their pricier rolls - what do you expect? It's reasonable to assume that a student ordering one roll or some sashimi and soup could get a good deal for their sushi fix. And I did get pretty large pieces of sushi in my last order, so at least I got what I paid for quantity wise.  Granted, it took a long time to get the food, but I did stop in during their dinner rush. Eating and picking up food anywhere in Oakland during the student dinner rush takes a long time. Oishii is admittedly one of the smaller places you could hit up for some grub, so during the dinner rush in particular there's practically no room for the crowd that gathers downstairs that's ordering and getting their food. I remember that there's an upstairs dining area that was pretty \"meh\" - it's a place to sit but it's not exactly a fine dining area.  I'm giving them 3 stars since I can't quite say \"yay I'm a fan!\" and I wouldn't go out of my way just to eat at Oishii - but hey, the food is decent and I'd consider stopping in again in a pinch, so that's worth an a-ok in my book!",

I've been coming here for years, and actually prefer it to all but the priciest sushi places in town. I'd recommend the red heat roll, caterpillar roll, California rolls, unagi bowl, and spicy pork bowl. I pretty much bounce around those options with some inari thrown in once in a while. They also have great party platters which are a good deal for three or more people.  My only complaint is with the wasteful takeout packaging which is used (to a lesser extent) even for eat in meals. Lots of plastic and, if you eat in, styrofoam goes to waste. I'd love to see actual dishes, or at least more thought put in to how much packaging is really required. How about adding a recycling bin at the minimum?",

The prices here are incredibly reasonable, the food is to die for and the service is so quick. It's more of a take-out place, so the space is very small but there are a few tables upstairs if you'd like to dine in. I really like that there is a decent menu of Korean and Japanese dishes. My husband and I ordered the bulgogi bento and the chicken katsu bento, which were both delicious. The bento boxes included some gyoza, pickled radish, perhaps japchae, rice and the main entree. Oh, not to mention you get a choice of a side: soup, salad or kimchi. The bulgogi was a shredded beef that had a little sweetness. The katsu chicken was a (very large) breaded and fried chicken cutlet, with a tangy, savory sauce on top. Both were amazing and fresh. I like the bento boxes because you get a little variety but they also have bowls, which don't include the little extras. They also have a variety of sushi which I'm really excited to try during my next visit. We will definitely be back!",

I wouldn't have cared if the food was half as expensive as it was, but it wasn't inexpensive by far.  Then you can take it to dine upstairs where you have a disarray of crowded shaky, unclean tables.  The tea was low-grade bagged green tea, served in a Styrofoam cup.  The sushi rolls were almost on par with what I'd expect to get from a Korean buffet.  Nothing exciting.  The special sauce was bland.  The crab, fake.  The rolls, sloppily cut.  The bulgogi was new to me, but my friend claimed it wasn't great.  I actually thought the peanut sauce was decent, the best part of the meal.  But the meat was bland, unmemorable.    I would never come here again.  There are much higher quality places within 5 miles that are more interesting and less expensive.",

This was 2 storage building which they have a seat at second floor also. I search the menu and this place more close to Korean food then Japanese. Price was very reasonable. I ordered Spicy Pork bulgogi bento and Miso soup, and it cost me not over 8 bucks. I been lived Los Angles for 17 years, so my taste for Korean food is very spoiled. When I tried to taste my food...well it was not great, but it was okay taste to me if you think about the price. Miso soup was not that great, and spicy pork was little too much sauce on it. But for the overall taste when I consider here is Pittsburgh it was pretty okay to me. I watched around what kind of the other people order here, and most of people was eating bulgogi ( Korean style rib eye) or garbi (Korean style BBQ short rib). I re command you try bulgogi bento or Gari Bento.",

Instead I usually order either the chicken katsu or beef bulgogi, both of which are quite good.  I don't like their udon - the selection of things in it, which includes broccoli, doesn't do much for me.  The shrimp tempura is all right, but if it's ordered in a bento box, it will probably get soggy from the broth before it makes it to your table.  The unagi isn't bad for the price, particularly since it's in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "Used to come here once a week during my days at Pitt.  Have to say it has some of the best food on Pitt campus.    Bulgogi Bowl is solid. Can't go wrong there, though I often went for something else. My wife's favorite.  Spicy pork bowl is my go-to lunch. Spicy, juicy.   Unagi Bowl used to be my dinner go-to till I figured that the eel is likely overpriced. I highly doubted that the eels were made in-house.  I dont blame them for it.  I just think there are cheaper options for the same taste.  Correct me if I am wrong.  My \"feel-good\" dinner go-to is \"Galbi Bento\".  I do think that their short ribs (bone-in) is one of the best in town. It is on the expensive-side of their menu. It's ~$15 dinner with sides, plus soup or kimchi.    Hwe Dup Bap is Korean style raw fish with rice.  It comes with lots of greens, diced raw fish (tuna & salmon).  Instead of wasabi, it comes with a spicy sauce to mix.  It's ok.  My better-half likes it, I prefer my galbi bento.  Only complain, I had Oishii Udon once for take-out.  The shrimp tempura started absorbing the broth and became soft.  They should have thought of it and placed the tempura in a second container.  Never tried in the house.  Overall, good price and taste for a campus food stop.  There is a help-yourself clean-up yourself dining area upstairs.  5* for campus food.",

It was good and I'll definitely get it again the next time I go here.  It was also a lot of food, more than a reasonable lunch's amount (and I have a healthy appetite).

I went on a weekend trip with a couple friends to Pittsburgh and we decided to stop here for lunch. The place is a little small, and really great for takeout, but they do have an upstairs area for seating. Service is polite and friendly.  They offer a variety of different foods, from bento boxes to bulgogi or galbi bowls, to bibimbap, pot stickers, or even sushi!  I went for the bulgogi bowl, because it has been ages since I've had one. (It was absolutely delicious.) My friend ordered bibimbap with beef, and since she couldn't finish it and I'm the resident food receptacle amongst my friends, I got to have that too, and it was equally as wonderful. :] (Portions are awesome, but I just eat a lot, haha.)  The prices are reasonable, and food is ready fairly quickly. They give you a receipt with an order number when you place your order, and you can either stay downstairs to wait, or sit upstairs until your number comes up on the screen. (We went on a Saturday afternoon, and the wait wasn't bad at all.  (I love the hot barley tea in the corner by the window!)  $5 minimum for credit card purchases, and you get a discount if you take in your receipt to get bubble tea next door!",

While the broth was somewhat spicy, it wasn't enough for me to actually call it as spicy. Regardless, it came with a healthy portion of vegetables and a lot of udon. It actually was enough to last me two days (and for under $9, that's insane!)  The sushi burrito was an experience of its own as well. The rice was seasoned PERFECTLY, everything inside tasted amazing. Unfortunately, my shrimp tempura inside was a bit soggy but everything else about this creation was mind blowing.

After 10 minutes my order was ready and I was outta there! I did notice a sign for extra seating upstairs but this is definitely not a place for large parties. Also, if you are in the mood for bubble tea take your receipt next door to chickn' bubbly for 50 cents off!   I couldn't wait to get home to eat my meal, it smelled amazing and by no surprise it tasted amazing too! I was really pleased with how much food you get for the price. I believe the price was around $9.63 and that ended up being two meals for me because my leftovers are now in the refrigerator. I cannot wait to come back and take my parents along with me! Next time I would like to try the Bibimbab or Galbi Bento.",

It's pretty basic, filling food and for the price it's decent.",

I don't even know if you can eat in, but the takeout service is great.  Favorites so far: chicken & beef teriyaki bowl and the chicken katsu bowl. The teriyaki bowls are pretty standard: protein, vegetable, rice. The teriyaki sauce is very nicely balanced, and doesn't have the overpowering saltiness that is so prevalent elsewhere. This is the kind of sauce you won't mind your rice ending up drenched in. Chicken katsu is breaded, fried chicken served on top of rice and with a tonkatsu sauce. Only wish it came with some vegetables. Both super tasty, recommend.",

I was thinking about ordering the fire box which looked like a spicy sushi bento box but it was too pricy.    We went upstairs to their dining area.  They had those Korean style order number systems that I have seen in Korean department stores food courts like shinsaegae.    Food came out.  It was very delicious.  The meat was very tasty and small bite size.  There was sliced cooked onions which enhanced the taste.  It also included mandoo (fried), white rice and chapchae but a little bit.    The price was good.    I think the owners also run the next door chicken and boba place so they gave a 50 cent discount coupon on the receipt.    We had a  honeydew slushies and I had strawberry.  Without the boba- we are not fans of the boba, but I am sure others like them.  Both of these places had clean area and friendly service.",

They have a digital number caller in the dining room so you don't miss your food.  Plus, lots of plasticware, chopsticks, and free water! This place is constantly packed (Pitt and hospitals close by) and you will find yourself sharing elbow room with someone you don't even know. Don't be alarmed! The food is excellent. I had a Chicken Katsu Bento and YUM! The rice is perfectly sticky. The Ton-Katsu sauce tastes like a rich, barbeque style (for those of us who don't regularly partake in Asian cuisine), which really complements the fried chicken.  And yes, Tim did make me try kimchi.",

It's a small little restaurant in Oakland that nearly always has a huge crowd that's flowing out the front door.  From Kalbi to Chicken Katsu bentos, I can't really complain. The selection here is centered around Japanese/Korean cuisine and includes sushi, bentos, noodles, and more. I haven't found anything I don't like on the menu, especially because I can easily try something new every time. The service here is always efficient and kind. Recently, I phoned in a take-out order that wasn't written down and sent to the kitchen. However, the cashier quickly made sure that my order was prioritized and that I'd get my food ASAP. I really appreciated her attentiveness to my issue and her effort to fulfill my order. The parking situation near here is pretty difficult, but there is a parking lot you can enter on South Bouquet St. that takes quarters! Overall, I'd highly recommend Oishii to anyone. If you want honest comfort food, this place will not let you down.",

Got the ocean breeze, which typically is tuna and salmon together in one roll; they offered eel which I thought was interesting so that was why I went.  My mistake! It's actually just a single order of salmon and single order of eel.  I should have realized it when it noted 12 pieces but I just thought maybe they were small.  Anyways, the guy got my order wrong and looked annoyed when I told him I didn't order tuna but salmon.  Luckily they provided some Barley tea on the side while you wait so I sipped myself to distraction while he remade my order.   So, not what I expected but it was good! Large pieces and the fish is good for the price. I think its slightly cheaper than Mt Everest but simpler rolls.  I think if I had to choose I would go back to Everest for sushi but potentially come here for their donburis, I hear their spicy pork is pretty good.",

    "text": "Oishii Bento is a great place!   Pros: Everything I've eaten there has been very tasty, my favorite thing on the menu being the Japanese burrito! The staff has always been very friendly.   Cons: Seating is very limited here, there's just a few tables upstairs and nowhere to sit outside. Sometimes during the lunch hours it can get super busy and take a little long for me to get my food, which is completely understandable but sometimes I've had to wait for quite a bit.  Other than those few small things I think this is a wonderful restaurant that I am always happy to go back to.",

I looked up sushi places via yelp and noticed Oishii Bento had a gerat mix of reviews and a nice menu.  My boyfriend went with Lion King Roll which is: shrimp & smoked salmon over a smoke salmon tempura roll (8pc/$9.50) It was delicious! I am not a fan of salmon fillets but this roll was great! I loved the sauce on top. He also ordered the Catapiller Roll which is: eel, avocado over a California roll (8pc/$11.50)  I went with a Chicken Teriyaki Bento. It has chicken & mixed veggies plus white rice. For sides they gave me 2 dumplings and rice noodles.   The food was great and it came out quick. I'm excited to head back for the lion king roll!",

I've also had the bentos once, and while I really enjoyed it, I usually just opt for the bowls because they're cheaper and give you more food.   The seating area is rather small though and it's upstairs. If you buy food here, you can show the receipt next door to Chick N Bubbly and they'll give you 50 cents off of bubble tea! Sometimes I'll just bring my food over the Chick N Bubbly and eat there after getting bubble tea, which can solve the seating problem.",

    "text": "When you first arrive at Oishii, your first thoughts are how pretty the sign is! Once you get inside, you'll find the interior is similarly colorful and cozy. They offer free barley tea (at least when I went, during the cold weather) and display their menu on large screens. When you order at the register, checkout is easy and friendly! After ordering, you're basically on your own -- everything from setting up your food at your table to cleaning up after is done by the customers, so it's definitely a more casual than sit-down place.  I came here with a friend during dinner hours and we went upstairs, where there's much more seating than downstairs -- the street level is really more for the ordering process rather than dining. We sat at a table, which was a little dirty, but I think that's just because we must have sat down right after another left -- we saw employees wiping down other tables pretty thoroughly. The place was definitely full as well.  The process of ordering was pretty organized! Once we were upstairs, there was a digital sign that dinged whenever an order was ready and displayed the order number. Once you pick up your food, you're ready to dig in!  I got the Bulgogi Bento Box with Kimchi, which is pretty popular, and I could taste why. They were pretty generous with the meat, gave a good amount of rice, and all the food in the box was delicious! There was enough for a full meal (or, if you're a smol person like me, enough for leftovers) and the bento comes in a disposable container that's easy to stow away in the fridge. The bento cost $10, which isn't cheap for a college student, but it's a nice meal to get every once in a while and arguably worth the money, considering how sparse Korean food is in Pittsburgh.   Overall, the atmosphere was cozy and casual, the employees were friendly, and the food was pretty good! Originally from an area where Asian food -- and in particular, Korean food -- is prevalent, I'd say the taste was pretty spot on, and worth the money for an occasional splurge.",

My boyfriend got the $7.50 bulgogi bento and I was amazed at the amount of food: side salad, pickles, 2 dumplings, a cold noodle salad, and plenty of beef and rice.  There are not too many vegetarian options so it probably won't be someplace I visit often, but the sushi was pretty good and we got a lot of food for about $15.

The bento boxes come with a little bit of chap chae (Korean glass noodles), kim chi, a salad with \"oriental dressing\", japanese yellow pickles, a few pot stickers (not bad, not good), and of course, whatever entree you ordered.

    "text": "This place is a favorite of mine in Oakland. Great sushi and seaweed salad! There are a variety of other choices as well but I usually go here for the sushi. If you work or go to school in Oakland, it's a nice little place to grab lunch. But there is one caveat - if you arrive during the lunch rush, you may have trouble finding a seat and the wait may be a bit long. This can be problematic if you need to get back to work in a timely fashion. Otherwise this place is a favorite of mine. Ah, my eel roll has just arrived and my spicy roll is on the way. Time to enjoy! I encourage you to do the same.",

I've sampled their Spicy Pork Bulgogi Bento/Bowl and their Galbi Bento, and both are delicious.  All the meat options are made to order.  Bowls come with the dish on top of rice while Bentos also include pickled yellow radish, kyoza's (Korean fried dumplings), japchae, and the choice of a basic salad (iceberg) with peanut sauce or kimchi.  An entire meal runs for around $10 tops, and the average wait is definitely less than 10 minutes.  Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Although the block of Oakland between Forbes and 5th is littered with \"Asian\" restaurants, most look dubious at best. Oishii is the sole exception. This clean and cheerful Korean/Japanese eatery serves solid lunch boxes efficiently at a reasonable price.    The bentos and bowls run for about $7. They are generously portioned and contain a good mix of flavors, making for a satisfying quick meal. I am less sure if it'd be worthwhile to get the sushi here. I suspect better quality-to-price deals can be scored elsewhere. I recommend the bibimbap.  Overall, I think the food quality is probably more in the range of 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding up because it is vastly superior to most other Asian fast-food options in Oakland.",

The salmon itself wasn't too bad, although I can tell it was probably frozen and recooked or something. The sauce wasn't too salty but it just tasted like soy sauce. The bento was worth its value and I would definitely recommend this place for its bentos. As for the sushi, I haven't tried it because they looked too big and \"plastic-y\". The place is definitely more \"fast food\" than \"restaurant\" but it's nice how they give you your order directly even while you're sitting upstairs.",

    "text": "Ever since this place opened up, my entire quality of life skyrocketed. I am originally from the Bay Area and am used to a large quantity of high quality Japanese food, not to mention my favorite Korean food ever (and I used to live in Hawai'i too). Since I moved here, I've tried udon in about 4 different \"Japanese\" restaurants. (I put that in quotes as the majority of them are run by non-Japanese who are clearly using a free hand to interpret the Japanese food.) This is the only place I got it more than once. In fact every month since they opened. And the Kal Bi, zomg, it is so good. Although after a year or so they sweetened the marinade. It's not as good, in my opinion, but totally worth ordering.  They have the tagline \"yummy lunchbox\" which is a literal translation of oishii bento. And let me tell you, it is seriously yummy. They are generously sized portions - the lunchbox will have rice, noodles, kimchi or salad, and a couple slices of picked daikon, and 2 gyoza as well as the main dish - and prices almost reasonable. I mean it's about Oakland prices when you compare to like, say, Qdoba, Panera, Red Oak Cafe, etc. I have also enjoyed the shrimp tempura appetizer and the beef bulgogi. The gyoza on the other hand is deep fried more in the Korean style, so that I don't love. Also the chicken teriyaki, while beloved of my co-workers, I found a little tough. Plus made with white meat, boooo. Oh, and they have sushi, but I am not a sushi eater, so don't ask me. Also, upstairs seating means it may be possible to eat in.  Frankly, Oishii is like one of my fave 3 restaurants in Pittsburgh. Oishii Bento, daisuke.",

    "text": "Oishii is the only legitimate option for sushi in Oakland.  I have eaten at Sushi Boat across the street and oishii is as good as sushi boat is bad.  Oishii is a \"fast food\" type asian place but the fish is extremely fresh.  My favorite items on the menu are the rainbow roll ($8.50), spicy tuna ($4.75) and the oishii roll ($8.75).    The rainbow roll is standard with a california roll topped with tuna, snapper, shrimp, eel, yellowtail, and salmon.  The Oishii roll is a huge inside out roll that has shrimp tempura on the inside and topped with smoked salmon covered in a house special sauce which seems to be spicy mayo.  The rainbow roll and oishii roll are a bit more expensive but are specialty rolls.  When comparing these specialty rolls to other restaurants, Oishii's are much, much cheaper.  One caveat: Oishii's rice is very sweet and most rolls are made using a lot of rice; this can make the rolls more filling, which to me is a good thing.  Normally my girlfriend and I can share three rolls and be full.  Food and price wise, I would give Oishii Bento 5 stars, but without waiter service it seems unfair to grant it a perfect 5.    Also, Oishii is normally filled with Asians, who I assume know Asian food.  I would take their word for it.",

While I have not tried any of the rolls the 3 times I've been here, I'm solely basing my generous rating on the Korean food because its the only place I know that can satiate this craving in the city.   The dining area is definitely small where there is a 2nd floor and a small bar area on the first floor. And the ambiance is catered for busy people looking for a bite to eat or for the college crowd. Call in advance for your carry-out order otherwise you can wait 5-10 minutes for a walk-in order if its busy. Good portions and expect to drop $8-10 per person.   What I've ordered: - bibimbap - recommend  - spicy pork bento (comes with your option of sides) - good enough  Will I come back? - when I need a quick korean fix",

My favorite is the katsudon, a breaded chicken cutlet cooked in a broth with scrambled eggs and onions and served over rice. The portion is HUGE, definitely enough for 1.5-2 meals or for one person who isn't counting calories. The bento are also fantastic, with fried gyoza, glass noodle salad, pickled daikon, rice, salad/kimchi and generous portion of the main dish. My favorite is the Oishii Bento itself with shrimp tempura over veggies in sauce, and any bento here is pretty much a \"eat this and skip dinner\" meal.   My office orders the big sushi trays ($50) for parties, and they are a huge hit. For cheap sushi, you can't beat this place, because the fish is actually good and the presentation is also very nice. If you have a big sushi order, definitely call in advance or order at an off-peak time, because the sushi chef is one of the busiest of their cooks.   Overall, a great Japanese/Korean food addition to the Oakland area, and everything is very authentic and tasty!",

However, if you are craving good sushi at a very reasonable price then this is the place to go.   I would highly recommend the oishii rolls and the galbi bento (if you like ribs).  It is located on the University of Pittsburgh campus so you would be sure to bump into a lot of students.",

I like getting a small order of Shumai, a small roll, or inari as a pre-class snack. The food comes out quickly, is very affordable, and always tasty! They also have free self serve barley tea which is a big plus when it's chilly out, and really warms you up!   For meals, they have great rice bowls that are a generous serving and pretty well balanced. I like the chicken teriyaki bowl, all of the bento boxes, and the udon! They have some seating downstairs and a bunch of tables upstairs, so you're good to eat in or take away. Also with your receipt, you can get 50c off at Chick n Bubbly next door! Get some bubble tea to wash down the meal :)",

So anyway, the place is a little shop along a street of other small Asian foods, and it really fits well in the scene. I usually like to stop by oishii and pair it with some other places around.  In terms of the food, I like it! It's very simple, cheap, and definitely fills you up. I would say the service can be a little slow at peak hour, so it's a good idea to order boba or run around for other food while you're waiting, but other than that, it's a well-run shop that is super consistent. The food gives a hint of homestyle Asian food, which is really nice if you're just looking for food that's comfortable and reliable.",

I work in the area and if I'm ever ordering out for lunch you'll most likely find me here getting a tonkatsu bowl with a side of seaweed salad.  This is a breaded and crispy pork dish with a sweet plum sauce.  The serving sizes are always more than I can handle, which makes leftovers something I look forward to ;).  I can't express how much I LOVE this place.  I've been going here for years and I've never been disappointed!   As for their menu they serve Korean and Japanese cuisine.  They have fresh sushi and I am not positive on this but I think they also own the store next door called chicken n bubbly that serves double fried chicken wings.  The receipt that comes from Oishi can usually give you a discount on the boba next door.  A couple of other dishes I've tried (but not pictured) include: bulgogi, bibimbap, teriyaki, udon noodles, and just about almost all the sushi options.  They also have interesting specials!  This is a great spot for students and professionals in the area.  I'm a big big fan",

Service is minimal as expected.   I ordered the spicy pork bento which comes with rice, two fried dumplings, onions, and some pickled veggies. I also got kim chi. My dad got the bulgogi bento and my mother and brother got some noodle dishes with pork and chicken, respectively. The bento dishes all have mushrooms in them, just an FYI.   My meal was quite good and had a little kick to it. I'm a fan of kim chi but the pickled veggies in the bento are a little much for me. I wasn't too crazy about the fried dumplings; they were okay, and my mother and brother who recently returned from Japan were disappointed with them, too.   It's fairly priced; it was about $50 for us and we got two sides, too. I'd go back for a quick lunch.",

    "text": "Their red heat roll is delicious!  it is a spicy California roll topped with tuna.  At 9 something after tax its worth it for a healthy tasty lunch.  It is quite beautiful too, but that's the raw tuna lover in me talking.  Sushi always amazes me because you know the fish were swimming in oceans thousands of miles away just two to three days ago!  Its always fresh at Oishii and sushi is a work of craft here (as it should be anywhere)!   Idk how but i only realized recently that wasabi complements raw fish so perfectly, it elevates the sushi/sashimi experience to another level.  If you're wary of the fishiness of raw fish try extremely fresh fish with wasabi and soy sauce.    It is unfortunate about this place that they use a lot of packaging and styrofoam and aren't environment friendly in that sense.  Maybe I'll suggest that they switch to real plates and such for their dine upstairs orders, I'm thinking it would be slightly more cost effective on their end as well.   Sadly I'm always crossing my fingers and hoping their fish is sustainably harvested and I'm not participating in killing fish stocks around the world whenever I'm eating fish, but fish is healthy brain food with lots of omega-3 fatty acids!    Their other dishes and bento boxes are great as well.  I particularly like their katsu don bowl, its one Japanese dish that i am obsessed with.  I will try it at any Japanese place I go to, the eggs and sauce are so delicious at a good place.    For korean food the kalbi bento is good, I have a weakness for beef short ribs in any form.  The portion size is just ok, someone with a normal to big appetite might crave more after the meal but that's always kalbi for you.",

I've had the bulgogi bowl, which is a generous portion of meat, almost caramelized onions, mushrooms, on top of rice. I also tried the bibimbap bowl, which was veggies, eggs, bulgogi, and rice. They also give you a spicy red sauce with it (it's sort of sneaky spicy, as it tastes sweet at first and you slowly realize there's a kick to it).  I was a bit disappointed with the bibimbap bowl, however, as it had very skimpy portion of bulgogi in it.",

After supposedly having the best Korean buffalo had to offer, i was curious to see how restaurants in Oakland measured up. After reading reviews on yelp, i decided to give oishii a try.  The galbi was awesome- juicy, fatty, and tender. Based on limited experience, the kimchi was also really good. Not to hot but not bland either. Maybe pricey by some college students standards, but you get your moneys worth. I recommend! I cant wait to come back and try what else oishii has to offer!",

They have seats upstairs so that's at least nice. I think a huge thing I would have to say is if you plan on getting anything with katsu, I would STRONGLY suggest that you get the sauce on the side. The sauce is super salty and the tonkatsu or chicken katsu will be over sauced if you just have them put it on directly. I got it once that way and totally regret it since I could only eat half of the serving. I just couldn't stomach the excess sauce. The next time I got it on the side, it was much better and you could taste the crispiness of the chicken.  Their bento boxes are pretty reasonable and while I would say the miso soup is a bit sub par, I would say everything else is pretty good eats.",

The flavor of the meat was overriden by the bibimbap sauce and I guest the owner kept the bulgogi juice out of the bowl to keep the bibimbap flavor neat. So I like the bento better. In addition to many kinds of delicious sides, you can get the best taste out of the bulgogi.",

I've been here on multiple occasions and the food is satisfyingly consistent. My go-to is the Spicy Pork Bento which comes with a huge portion of rice, spicy-sweet pork, japchae (glass noodle dish), two fried dumplings, some radish, and your choice of kimchi, miso soup, or salad. I always go for salad because I like the dressing and it's refreshing with the rest of the meal! Though pricier than many other options in Oakland, the bento lasts me at least 2 (if not 3 meals when I add some kimchi or sides at home) which makes it well worth the price!  It's usually crowded and buzzing on the ground floor to order with a pack of people waiting for takeout, but I've always been able to find a table in the small upstairs dining area. Pop upstairs and grab a table and some water or hot barley tea - your order might take a while and there's an additional screen upstairs for displaying order numbers ready for pickup.  Service is mostly limited to your order and transaction, so don't expect much - you're here for the food.  For a quick meal to satisfy your comfort Korean food cravings or a budget-friendly place to meet up with friends, Oishii is a great pick!",

I was craving sushi on this warm day so I ordered a salmon avacado roll ($5) and seaweed salad ($3). The roll is beautiful and delicious. Everything is fresh! An equal amount of fish & avocado is in each piece, which is a sizeable mouthful. The sushi rice has nice flavor so you don't need soy sauce imho. The wasabi paste is not weak! The seaweed salad smells fresh, has the lovely crunch that I crave and is a nice portion.   Overall a great experience and at great price you know I'll be back.",

My favorite entrees are the KATSU-DON and BIBIMBAP. I personally don't think that the sushi is worth the price since it is right across the street from Sushi Fuku and Mount Everest. The service is decently fast, but if you order any entree with katsu it's going to be a little longer wait. There is an upstairs seating area which is nice since it gets busy during lunch and dinner, but I hope they are able to open more seating because it gets crowded during dinner time. Will definitely recommend coming here if you want a good and filling meal!  tldr; food 5/5 service 5/5 space 3/5",

    "text": "Oishii. My default spot when it comes to a great tasting, affordable meal on Pitt campus. Oishii is closed on sundays.. I am well aware of this because for whatever reason I always crave Oishii after church, ahh.. you want what you can't have (on Sundays).  KATSU-DON ($8.75): My go to. I just love the pork with the veggies and then the house broth makes the bowl not too dry, like the tonkatsu or the chicken katsu are. Some may think it is a little sweet, but when I come to Oishii, I'm getting the Katsu-Don 99% of the time. SPICY PORK BOWL ($8.00): Also a great choice, with the pork and veggies all the same reddish color, it may not be the most prettiest dish, but it does have a kick of spiciness! If I'm in the mood for just a lotta pork and some fried onions in there too, this is what I'm getting. The portions are so generous here that I never feel like I'm wasting my money. VEGETABLE TEMPURA ($7.25): For those times when I want to be fake healthy and eat veggies but they're fried. The fried zucchini and onions are meh, but the fried sweet potato is super delish! The tempura come with a sauce to dip in.  SEATING: Is very limited to like 3 chairs on the main floor and like 30-40 seats upstairs? So choose your dining time wisely, or just do take out! However they do have sriracha, soy sauce, barley tea, and water here if you do decide to stay.  SERVICE/WAIT-TIME: Probably at least 15 mins for your food to be made, they give you a number and you wait until it's called/ on their number system thingy in the upstairs.  **Want to skip the wait? Call in beforehand and place an order via the phone and pick it up when you get there. Give them some time because this place is popular and they take their time making your yummy Korean food.  Not the cheapest option on campus, but I do think that most of the entrees are worth it. ~$10 for a bowl might seem a lot, but you actually get a lot of food to save for a second meal, otherwise you may fall into a food coma if you can eat it all in one sitting..",

Oshii was one of the first restaurants I ate at in Pittsburgh, and it has always been one of my go to spots. It's consistent - everytime you go you know what to expect and the food delivers everytime. Not to mention, I am satisfied with all the prices there, as well as the portions (especially on the katsu don). What also stands out is that it fills you up but tastes clean - doesn't feel heavy and make you feel gross after.   Typically I order katsu don which has pork, egg, and onion over rice which gives good variety compared to other things like the bulgogi bowl that is mainly just meat over rice. Sometimes I order the kalbi bento, (around $13) which is pricier but very tender and juicy. Bi Bim bap is another great dish for variety, gives you a decent amount of veggies to go with everything.   You can also order online before hand so you save time.",

Each order feels like about 2 servings so it's definitely a lot and will keep you full and satisfied. Definitely if you wanna treat yourself, go with the galbi or hwe-dup bab. Food here is not the cheapest but it's good food and fast. Getting take-out here is ideal bc seating can be very limited during the busy lunch and dinner hours. Don't forget that if you order food here, you can get 50 off a bubble tea order next door at Chicknbubbly! During the winter times, they have complementary warm barley tea they offer near the corner by all the condiments.   Overall, can't say many bad things about this place because it just really is a convenient place to get Korean/Japanese food well made and fast.",

And one more reason why i give this a 3 instead of 4 is because they always use plastic utensils, bowls, plates, bento.... and then put that in a plastic bag Even when you dine in. I mean, they have dish washers, theres no need to be that lazy, plus harming the environment, hello?",

Hey girl, it was our first time in the place and it's not a strictly Japanese or Korean cuisine.  It is a mash up.  I felt like we were bugging the girl at the register.  She seemed really bored and would rather be anywhere else but there.  That didn't deter us from ordering and it was very flavorful food.  I had the a shrimp and scallop dish with vegetables while my son had chicken teriyaki.  When we were leaving, the cook/owner was sitting in the waiting area; he thanked us for our business.  I would go back for the food but not for anything else.  I think takeout is an excellent choice for next time.",

Super clean and vertically compact inside. Order on the first floor and can eat on the second. Oishii to me is all about business.   I came in looking for an array of udon dishes but instead found a focus on bento, sushi and bowls. I settled on the bulgogi bento with an app of tempura. Tempura was crispy and not greasy accompanied by a light sauce. Bulgogi bento came with cold noodles, rice, bulgogi beef and mushroom and onion combo, something yellow and then dumplings. Also with some miso soup. I enjoyed the cold noodles and dumplings. Bulgogi was ok though I think I will come back for the spicy pork. What I like about Oishii is the price for all of this food - $7.50 for the bento and $7 for the tempura. Can't be beat for dinner. I'll be back to try other things.",

I came in during the lunch rush so there were a ton of people there. I got takeout so I waited downstairs but the waiting area was small so I winded up standing most of the time. The wait was quite long but so was the line, especially for a tiny place. I waited probably a good 10 to 15 minutes for my food and it was just uncomfortable for the first 5 minutes, since you had 20 people cramped in a space the size of my college dorm room.   The food was not as good as I expected. I got the ton-katsu bento and una-q roll. The ton-katsu bento had its good points and bad. Good point was that the ton-katsu itself was pretty good. Another good point was all of the side dishes and the miso soup that it came with. Bad point was that the sauce was on top of the ton-katsu unevenly so I got too much sauce with some bites and too little with other bites. It would have been better if the sauce came on the side for to go orders, which I assumed it would as it was my first visit. The sushi, on the other hand, was mostly bad points. I absolutely love sushi so I was super excited to try some but winded up pretty disappointed. It was the type of sushi that you could get at any American supermarket. It had a ton of rice and some avocado and cucumber, and a tiny dot of eel. Not impressed at all.   One thing that I really liked was that they had free hot barley tea in the corner, which was amazing on a day with negative degrees. It was not noticeable but it was still pretty nice that they offered that in the waiting area for takeout orders.   Service: 4 stars - nothing out of the ordinary but I loved the barley tea Bento: 4 stars - pretty good Sushi: 1 star - pretty disappointed Overall: 3 stars - there were other foods I wanted to try but I may or may not go again.

It's very accessible in Oakland, and there is a small parking lot next to it (metered).  I only get one thing here: The bulgogi bento.  It costs under $10, and you get the kimchi or salad along with sides of Korean clear noodles (SO GOOD), some fried dumplings, and those yellow carrot things.  The bulgogi has a lot of onions though (which is fine).  And I am obsessed with Oishii salad.  Weird I know, but I think it's some sort of sesame or ginger dressing (forgot), but it's very good.  I've gotten the udon here before, but it's kind of bland.  So, bulgogi it is!  It's kind of hard to find seating during busy hours because both upstairs and downstairs there isn't much seating area.  You can get free water upstairs too.  I love this place and I'm going to miss it when I leave CMU!",

Most of the times their galbi bento is great and I love it, but sometimes the meat is dry or extra fatty or has too many bones. Their miso soup usually has a little too much base, but it's easily fixable with hot water from upstairs. Finally I wish that their korean noodles had a little more flavor as they are a little bland, but overall anything you get at Oishii bento is worth the price compared to the other korean restaurants in the area which are much pricier.",

I don't, however, recommend the teriyaki bentos here.  I had the tofu teriyaki bento, and there was just too much sauce.  And big pieces of cooked onion.  Unfortunately the two vegetarian friendly bentos here are teriyaki dishes (tofu and vegetable teriyakis), so maybe I'm just outta luck.  The vegetarian sushi rolls are pretty limited to just cucumber, avocado and carrot, but they're decent.    The upstairs seating area is brightly colored and pleasant for an Oakland eatery.  I'll come back to try the vegetable bibimbab.  *Edit: Another Yelper pointed out that teriyaki sauce can have meat/meat-based ingredients in it.  I didn't think of asking the folks at this place about that.  Double check before ordering if this is an issue for you, too.   You're not missing much if the teriyaki dishes aren't vegetarian-friendly.",

The greater portion of the menu consists of Bulgogi and Teryiaki based Bentos and Bowls as well as Sushi. I opted for a Bulgogi bowl which consisted of Korean style beef with rice, mushrooms, onions, scallions, and sesame seeds. It was  satisfying and filling (in fact, I was unable to finish the entire bowl). I would have preferred for the dish to be served with peppers and more scallions, but I will have to wait until next time to make that request.  I haven't had Korean food elsewhere in Pittsburgh, but the restaurant takes a fast approach to a typically slow, tapas-like cuisine. The adaptation certainly accommodates the restaurant's clientele (college students) and allows it to compete with the neighboring restaurants.  Lastly, I recommend ordering ahead. The wait for my food was only 15 minutes, but most of the customers who walked in ordered ahead and were immediately on their way.",

I got the pork katsu, which arrived in a generous amount. However, the pork was too dry and the sauce too sour.   The vegetable tempura was fried well and crispy but the vegetable slices were not cut well (the pieces were too big) -- the zucchini was cut at a diagonal because the slice was almost as long as the chopstick itself.   The Oishii bento was also a disappointment. The tempura here was soggy and the button mushrooms were too sweet.   If I were to come back again, I would try the galbi bento again.

The \"main\" of the bentos are more manageable for some reason? So maybe it's a psychological thing for me, or smaller compartments in the bentos than would fit in a bowl. I don't know, never done a side by side.   I don't like the tanginess of tonkatsu and theirs had very bold flavors, for those who like that. I love the bulgolgi - very homey, great flavor, goes perfectly with rice. Anything pork here I've tried is really good.

I could've chosen among sushi, udon, bento, or bowls for my meal.  I decided upon the Bulgogi bowl with the help of my dining companion for my lunch.  It was a huge bowl of rice and thinly sliced beef, mushrooms, onions, and scallions.  It was very delicious and more than enough.  I ended up taking 1/2 of it home for dinner.    It's a small venue.  At first I thought it only consisted of the downstairs which only held room for a few at a small window counter.  I was glad when my friend escorted me upstairs to a bigger dining area.  Good thing we got there at 11:30; it soon filled up with the lunch crowd.  My happy dining experience cost under $7.00, well worth it.",

Food was very reasonably priced considering the size of the portions that were given. Be sure to check their daily specials!  I don't understand all of the 3 star or less reviews. They seem to be just very picky people and maybe it wasn't up to their \"standards,\"  but before you go believing their nonsense, give this place a try. The food was delicious, got it within 10 minutes (remember that speed doesn't always equal satisfaction. They cook the food fresh per order; expect about a 10-15 minute wait) and the staff was very nice. Will come here again!",

The bento boxes portions are huge, usually lasts me like two meals. There are more seatings upstairs if needed.   My favorite thing there is the spicy pork bento box. Bento boxes come with your main protein, white rice, a little bit of clear noodles, 2 or 3 fried dumplings, a few slices of pickled yellow radish and your choice of miso soup or side salad. Miso soup tasted kind of bland, and salad had an interesting peanut sauce dressing. The spicy pork is a combination of spicy and sweet. If you like spicy food, I highly recommend the spicy pork bento. For those who want a smaller, healthier portion, I recommend any of the Bibimbap bowls. Again, I always get the spicy pork bibimbap bowl. It comes with your main protein, fresh chopped veggies, kimchi and a fried egg.",

Actually the restaurant was run by Korean and the chef was not from Korean either.  The katsu chicken was cooked too tough and without chicken taste.  Also I did not see any katsu source like Japanese family run restaurant.  Even the Korea bowl is not good because the chefs are not from Korea.  Overall,  1. Go to other authentic Japanese run restaurant for Katsu chicken which is the Japanese food.  Do not order Ton-katsu chicken Bento.  Otherwise, you will waste your money.  2.  Go to authentic Korea restaurant with Korea chef for authentic Korea foods.",

I need a go-to Soon Doo Boo place. Still haven't found one in Pittsburgh.  Oishii bento is the best so far. The name of the restaurant implies it's Japanese.  I guess it sort of is, maybe?  This place is one of those places that likes to sprinkle sushi into their menu.    I'd give this place 3.5 stars if I could, but I'll accept rounding up.  It's not quite a 3 star place for me.  Oh well, at least it's better than what I had in Shreveport, LA, where I suffered for four years by the lack of culture and the battles through medical school.  Food (7.759/10) = the spicy pork bowl and bibimbap aren't bad at all.  Certainly not the best, but close enough.  The price is very reasonable for $7 a bowl.  Actually,..I can't remember the last time I saw a Korean restaurant serving spicy pork bulgogi or bibimbap for less than $10.  They throw in a quarter cup of kimchi for you too.  I haven't tried the sushi.  I haven't tried the Japanese dishes like udon or katsu-don.  Ambiance (7.5/10) = chill AZN joint.  Order your food downstairs, and go upstairs to chow down.    Service (7.5/10) = standard.  Order your food downstairs, pick it up.  AZN fast food.  Overall Opinion = Oishii bento, you will have to do for now until I find a more suitable place for Korean food.",

There was a really efficient number system to their food and while the food didn't come on ceramic plates, the food itself was so good I forgot about it.   We got the salmon roll, california roll, and a bulgogi bento box.  Everything was perfect. The food was equivalent to food that you'd get at any other classy upscale asian restaurant.  The amount of food that you get for the price is something you can't get anywhere else.",

So yes, they have one menu for the whole day (e.g. no lunch menu).  If I took out the price factor, since I am not Pittsburgh/Oakland cost of living knowlegeable, then I likely would have given the four stars if they were in alignment...but I didn't see anythwhere else that supported a higher cost of living than the Denver area, so integrating that in...results in a 3 star rating.  So the food..,we got the bulgolgi and bibenbop both weremade with great ingredients and flavor. Service was so-so. However I was there around 3 in the afternoon so they were busy doing other stuff I guess. There were no real tables to sit at, so we took it somewhere else to eat (really small place).

When you combine it with onions and mushrooms its really an incredible dish. The sides are great, too. It usually comes with dumplings, some pickled radish, rice, and glass noodles. You also get kimchi or soup on the side. What a great place. I will be a frequent customer as long as I live here.",

Only plus side was that it was fair-priced for the amount of food you receive.  Perhaps I went at a bad time, as it was early in the afternoon.
