There is also a $15 minimum to use card, which is a turn off for me as I'm not particularly much of a fan of carrying wads of cash in my wallet especially with higher prices. Good Chinese food (any of the meat dishes over rice are just fine) though the price would definitely leave something more to be desired. Bubble tea is also to be had here ... probably the best bubble tea I've had in Pittsburgh so far though the bubbles could be a bit softer in my opinion.",

I'm originally from the San Gabriel Valley where asian food is so abundant and delicious that people practically inhale it, so I have something to compare it to... However, the one time I got boba here it tasted like it had been sitting in liquid for longer than it should. They weren't chewy at all. It might've have been because I got it late at night. Besides that the food good.",

I ordered the calamari, thinking it would be fried, but I received literally squid in some broth, which I understand why they had that but it should have been specified that it was SQUID not fried CALAMARI. And it was way overpriced. I also ordered the tempura shrimp, but it also came inside a broth???? It tasted nasty. I paid with a credit card but I was low on money so I couldn't leave a tip. When the delivery guy came, he demanded I give him a tip. I usually always leave a tip but demanding I give him one is sort of rude. He straight up said \"so I can just charge your credit card for a tip?\" And I said sure you can charge me $1 because I am a student and I was seriously broke. And he looked at me and said \"but your total was more\", in which I was ticked off at because leaving a tip should not be demanded. All in all, they have good boba, but because this is Pittsburgh and authentic Asian food is not common here, that is the only reason why I would say their boba was good.",

Friend ordered a small drink and they made a large drink and instead of just making a new one, they asked if it's okay for him to just pay for the larger drink price.  When it came to the bill, we asked for the bill to be split and we wrote on the receipt indicating which card has what items, they ended up splitting the bill but billed one card TWICE so that one card got billed for the whole bill instead of a split.  They apologized and said there is absolutely nothing they can do.. they cannot reverse the transaction and they say it is just what it is.  I'm sure at other restaurants, if they make mistakes like this, vouchers or % off would be given but over here, if they make a mistake, the customer has to take care of it and be okay with it which I thought is a little strange and unprofessional.",

    "text": "I recently moved to Pittsburgh from Southern California, so, to be perfectly honest, I wasn't expecting much in terms of options for asian restaurants here. But I have to say that I've been pleasantly surprised. Lately I've been ordering the pork chop over rice and black tea (half sugar) at various Taiwanese cafes in the area (e.g., Rose Tea Cafe, Cool Ice Taipei) to establish a baseline of sorts for what I consider to be pretty standard Taiwanese fare.  Having said that, the pork chop over rice ($7.50) here is quite good. Lately, my main concern has been the amount of vegetables served with the pork chop. At Rose Tea and Cool Ice for example, they skimp on the veggies, leaving me feeling bloated from the disproportionally large portion of fried pork chop. Lucky for me, I Tea Cafe provides bigger portions of veggies; the only downside is that their version excludes the marinated egg, which happens to be one of my favorite parts about the meal.  What's more, I found the Sun Moon Lake Black Tea ($3.25 for 16 oz.), a dark auburn tea with a special sweet aroma and woodsy flavor, to be quite enjoyable and distinct from black teas at other Taiwanese cafes in the area.   Overall, this is a solid Taiwanese cafe with food you'd expect to find at reasonable prices. I'll be back to try their hot pot, beef noodle soup, and other teas.  NOTE: $15 minimum for credit cards.",

The prices are extremely reasonable, the portions are good, and the authenticity is through the roof.  You may look at the menu and think it sounds bland.  \"Fried chicken with noodles.\"  \"Pork chop over rice.\" \"Scallion pancake with egg.\"  And it may be a challenge for those who need more description.  Having said that, what the plates make up for pedestrian names, they make up for wonderful flavor.  Okay, it is a bit off the beaten path, a few blocks down from Walnut Street.  But they've renovated the place (formerly Pizzuti's), and all the tables are able to have Shabu-Shabu.  There's also lovely Bubble Tea options?  We actually had their fresh Watermelon juice which was a mouthful of summer goodness.  This place is a must-try, and your new go-to spot for a Chinese fixin'.",

    "text": "I would love to give this place 5 stars because it's authentic, and as a Chinese person, this means a hell lot to me. However, a few things just fall short.  Let's start with the pros. Most of the dishes are awesome. I've had almost everything and all of the rice dishes as well as most of the noodle dishes have been great. ~8 dollars is pretty reasonable for the usual dishes, and the servings are pretty generous. I usually only go when I'm really hungry, and I'll usually leave with a very full stomach. Again, these dishes are authentic Taiwanese food, and that means a hell lot to me. And they also have a good atmosphere and maintain fairly clean. So I really wanted to give this place a 5.  They also have hot pots, bubble teas, and pho, which are kinda rare in this place. This should have been a pro, but all 3 items are slightly overpriced. Also, the hot pots are quite \"fixed\". You don't really get to choose your food. And there are no substitutions given for the veggies that come with the meat. The serving is also huge, so if you want to add any side dish, chances are you will be throwing a lot of stuff to waste. And the hot pots aren't that good anyway. They only have a few kinds of soup bases, and all of them fall bland. Beef and lamb slices are also not the best quality. There's not much competition around the area for hot pot, but I don't judge on competition. But anyway the sauce station for the hot pot is pretty decent.  Their pho is also just so so, but they charge an above average price. I understand that there's the monopoly, but I really won't recommend it. Their bubble tea is nice and I do buy those a lot. However, it would be nice if they could add a few flavors, like mango or some other fruits. And the bubble teas aren't that cheap... Even with buy 5 get 1 free, it's still kinda overpriced...  Oh, and they won't accept credit card for orders less than 15.  So that's it. I'd really recommend the rice and noodle dishes and some of the appetizers as well, and the bubble teas are not bad either, and if you really want hot pot, you can get it here. But overall, this place falls a bit short of a 5 and it's really a shame.",

The boba was the right consistency (chewy, soft) and the tea itself was left a little unsweetened, so it didn't taste artificial and more like actual tea with milk in it. It did take a while for the cashier to help us even though there was no one in line, but it's not a big deal. My whole floor ordered a bunch of milk teas for delivery, and my order did get messed up on the list (didn't have boba), so make sure you specify that you want boba when you order if you want it!",

Customer Service: Usually is passable, but if you catch them on a day an hour before close... hmm, well they would rather be getting ready to drive home I guess.  The server generally looked pissed off that we even decided to eat there and was miserable the whole time including the ONE time he decided to fill up our water only after we asked for it.   General Atmosphere: It's great that they have the hotpot tables,  really interesting, but it makes the tables abnormally long, you feel like you are sitting far away from your friends. They have a random TV there, the only times I've seen it on were when the kids were sitting around watching it.  Which is ok at home, but Silver Surfer movies and random commercial flipping doesn't exactly seem to fit the restaurant.  Well thats my review.  There are other restaurants with hotpot, and the other hotpots I have had in the past have been cheaper and tastier.",

If you take out, beware of promised times. I have waited an extra thirty minutes past the promise time they told me. I definitely would go back for the beef noodle soup and salt pepper chicken.",

    "text": "My first impression of the place wasn't fantastic--while the food certainly looked delicious (the cafe, in fact, was quite populated with Asians, which means the food MUST be good), the bubble tea I ordered was not. I ordered a large plum bubble tea expected the refreshing taste of fresh plum and tea like the places in Chinatown Philly make it, but the drink ended up being really sour. They make their fruit teas/bubble teas with Asian-style preserved/dried salted fruit that can be purchased at Asian grocery stores in little plastic jars. It might be good to some other people, but it's not what I expected and I don't like dried salted fruit. I've had dried salted plum (exactly what this drink tasted like) before because my mom purchases it often but it's just not my thing.  Yesterday, though, a couple of friends and I ordered $25 worth of bubble tea and food (mostly bubble tea) and to my surprise after having a bad first experience, everything was awesome. The salt & pepper chicken my friend ordered came with Shanghai Bok Choy, something you definitely don't see in Asian take-out very often (usually come with broccoli or something). We ordered a honey bubble milk tea, original bubble milk tea, mango bubble tea, matcha red bean bubble milk tea, and kumquat bubble tea (which I ordered and should have figured that it would be made with dried preserved kumquat again). The matcha red bean milk tea was my favorite--the matcha milk tea flavor is very potent and refreshing, unlike many other places that serve matcha milk tea that just tastes like straight up sugar and milk. This place will definitely be my go-to for bubble tea from now on (just not the fruit flavors) and I can't wait to try the smoothie version of the matcha red bean drink, and their taro smoothie.  Like a lot of people said, they have a $15 minimum for card. It really sucks, but luckily the first time I went and didn't have cash on me, they cashier was really nice and understanding and told me just to remember to have cash if I ever make purchases under $15.  Overall, I like this place in terms of their drinks, and $3.25-$4.25 for a bubble tea is not bad at all considering how much some other places charge for less flavorful drinks of lower quality. I'll have to try more of their food sometime.",

    "text": "Finally, some decent Asian food in this part of Shadyside! I was super happy to come back to Pittsburgh and learn that Shadyside has a legit bubble tea and Taiwanese place; it's always a hassle getting to Squirrel Hill.  The bubble tea is solid, and they use real tea. I don't necessarily think it's the best in the city, but it's pretty good.   The Thai Fried Chicken is very crispy, juicy and flavorful, maybe a tad too salty. The Scallion Pancake is great as well, and the dipping sauce is unique. The Hot Beef Noodle Soup is one of their more popular dishes, and I see why: large portions of beef and greens in a savory, chili-oil laden broth.  I haven't tried the individualized hot pot, but judging from the rest of their dishes, it's probably solid.",

    "text": "This cafe is really ... \"Asian\" - it's hard to describe, but funnily enough it's always the first word that comes to mind. The decor and silverware and plates and everything is really reminiscent of an Asian cafe, which is appropriate I guess.  I've been here twice so far and it's given me enough confidence that I'd try more of their dishes. The menu is small enough that one can realistically hope for quality over quantity, and it's solely Taiwanese food instead of generic Americanized Chinese.  We had shabu shabu the first time, and while it's no AYCE in Chinatown Chicago, there was more than enough food to completely stuff me for $18 - veggies, tofu, mushrooms, an adequate serving of meat, and mung bean noodles. I loved their self serve sauce station since one of my favorite parts about hot pot personally is mixing and creating sauces.  The spicy soup base tastes and looks just like storebought ma la soup base for $1 - but my friend found hers too mild and they brought a whole bowl out so she could help herself - love the generous auntie in the back.   The salted pepper chicken is delicious :) Crispy fried, delicately seasoned, and very flavorful.   The luroufan (marinated pork with rice?) is a staple, and they definitely nailed it - much better than Everyday Noodle! Excited for the noodle soup, based on this.  Their bubbletea selection is smaller but their original and \"mountain\" milk tea is pretty good. I find them to be on the sweeter side - esp with honey still stuck on the sides of the cup - but the texture and flavor of the boba and teas is still pretty on point. Maybe next time I could ask for less sweetener and that'd solve the problem, and that's a much smaller problem compared to some other offerings in the city.  The service is a bit removed/shy, but polite and attentive enough in the front. Occasionally the woman (owner?) comes and she's super friendly and makes me want to return more, especially to feel like I'm being taken care of by an auntie or something :)  Overall, very solid taste of Asia in Pittsburgh.  I'm so glad a place like this exists now. Love seeing my little hometown grow ;D",

I only tried their bubble tea so far but am interested in returning for hot pots and other interesting-seeming dishes.  The bubble tea menu has some different offerings than I am used to seeing (mountain tea?  grass jelly? chocolate hazelnut???)  Sadly I could not get my old standbys like almond milk tea or coconut milk tea so was forced to branch out to black sugar black tea.....it was interesting though I did miss the flavored powders.  Still, a good place to get one's Taiwanese fix in the Shadyside area.  (P.S.  Drink only orders are cash-only.)",

The restaurant itself is in a good location--right off of Walnut Street. I understand that it was a cold winter night, but the temperature was uncomfortable. Each time that someone entered the building, an icy cold draft swept through the restaurant. I suppose that this wouldn't have mattered if we weren't a large party of 10 attempting to enjoy a birthday dinner with a friend who studied abroad in China and was obsessed with hot pot restaurants when she was there.  For taste, the rice dishes were very tasty. I find it difficult to find places that cook tofu to its optimal crispiness, but do not cook it into the texture of an eraser (weird analogy, just go with it). I was able to try a bit of a friends hot pot. The sauce station allows people to customize their spices in their broth, but the overall quality of the vegetables were disappointing. It seemed as if they cut up the veggies every morning and place them in baskets to serve throughout the day, so by 8PM, things were a little soggy. The steamed dumplings had a delicious sauce, and they have a wide variety of bubble milk teas!  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, but it was a fun experience and our waiter was accomodating.",

    "text": "This review is based on a delivery order, so I can't compare it with how the dine-in experience is. I went into I Tea Cafe once before and had ordered a tea to-go, which was pretty decent, but have yet to eat a meal there.  Was looking forward to trying the food and decided to order delivery since I lived close enough to the restaurant that the food wouldn't go cold by the time it reached my apartment.  Delivery took about 45-50 minutes, so I would not recommend getting delivery from here if you are really hungry. (I live about 7 minutes walking from the place, just for reference).  Ordered 2 dishes: the hot beef noodle soup and thai curry chicken over rice.  Food was okay; more oily than I expected, which overpowered much of the taste.  Chicken was prepared Chinese-style, so it included bone and skin.  (In my opinion, that's more flavorful than dry pieces of chicken breast, but I realize that's not for everyone.)  The beef was pretty fatty.  I was expecting thin slices of lean meat, so it was disappointing, especially since the broth itself was more than oily enough.    All in all, OK Chinese food if you are in a pinch, live in Shadyside and don't feel like going out to Squirrel Hill.  I've read in other reviews that the food is hit-or-miss, so maybe I'll give them another try someday.    FYI, delivery fee costs $1.00 on a minimum order of $15.  With dishes ranging $8 and up, it's easy to go over $15.  Kicker for me was, the delivery guy asked me for a tip.  My principle is, if a delivery fee is charged, then tip is optional.  Even if it's a $1.00 charge.  If it was pouring rain or middle of winter with snow all over, I would've tipped on top of the delivery charge.  But for someone to ask for a tip - no, I think his exact words were \"that'll be $21.22, and don't forget tip\" - no way in hell was I giving him extra money.  I gave him $22, and let him keep the 78 cents in change.",

The flavours they manage to infuse into the broth are amazing and the beef simply dissipates in your mouth. It is a hearty concoction that leaves you very satisfied. I'd love more vegetables in the dish but that's just a personal preference. Also, for take-out,they kindly pack the noodles separately to the broth so that you don't end up with 'bloated' noodles by the time you arrive home.

I ordered 2 appetizers and was told that they have a $15 card minimum so I was forced to order bubble tea to be able to pay for my meal. Then I sat there and waited an entire 40 minutes (while there were NO customers in the store!) for my food to come out. The food was alright, but the portions were tiny. The bubble tea was terrible.

I ordered the fried dumpling appetizer, drip ice coffee, and the beef shabu shabu + a side order of shrimp balls.  I never got my appetizer nor the order of shrimp balls, and they had still left it on the check until I told them their mistake. The shabu shabu was really yummy (I particularly liked that we were able to go to a sauce shelf and pick out different things to change the flavor) so that almost brings my rating of this place to 2 stars, but the service was so horrible that I can't bring myself to do that. The drip ice coffee (which btw, I've had drip ice coffee numerous times all over the place. IT IS NOT WORTH THE ~$5.50 you are paying for it. It doesn't taste like real drip ice coffee. In fact, it just tastes like instant coffee that they Falsely advertise as drip. Which with how terrible the service was, it's possible that they accidentally gave me the wrong coffee.) was not even given to me until right as I was about to pay for our check and cancel the order of ice coffee.  Also, their maximum of 2 credit cards per table is ridiculous. I understand that this is a Pittsburgh thing, and with certain POS (computer restaurant systems), it is difficult to separate checks. However, this place has a current POS system, which means it is not difficult at all to make separate checks.  Moral of this story, if there are more than 6 people in that restaurant, enter at your own risk of not getting your entire order.  I may go back and give them a 2nd try, but with how rude the waitress was and the overall incompetence of the service, probably not.",

The lady who seated us was extremely rude as she tossed our menus onto a table and walked away. The second lady who took our order was a bit nicer. There's a lot of options on the menu, with rice entrees and noodle soups and ramen and shabu shabu etc. We chose the hot beef noodle soup, salt and pepper fried chicken, and braised beef over rice. The fried chicken was not bad, pretty standard Taiwanese taste. On the other hand, the braised beef was extremely salty, and the noodle soup was also a little too salty. The meat in the noodle soup was quite chewy and had a strange flavor. The portions were quite good, but I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.",

They recently revamped their menu so they offer ramen now! Also, they have a couple new menu items like the pork with duck yolk. In general, everything is just fried, so the taste is pretty strong. The rice helps diffuse the heaviness or the taste.  I wouldn't say 5 stars because the service is just alright. They definitely leave you to your own devices and give you the check generally before you finish your dinner. The food is also definitely alright, but doesn't have the wow factor you would have for some restaurants. Perhaps, I may be wrong with their new food items though!",

Other reviewers have said the service is lacking - they're not wrong, but it didn't bother me, since I was alone and don't necessarily like to be bothered much when I'm eating.   The broth was perfect, not salty, and there were plenty of noodles. Maybe could have used more meat, but I'm so full after polishing off my bowl I don't know how I would have been able to finish it if there were. The basil and sprouts were perfectly fresh and crisp.  Also special shoutout to the waitress that came over after the two tables next to me had cleared out and softly suggested the right way to open the seal on my iced tea without being patronizing. Apparently you just stab it. Who knew!",

The first time I ate here, I had food poisoning that night - at that time I wasn't sure if it's definitely the food from here. Just went here for a second time with my husband because he is excited to try shabu-shabu. The overall experience is awful. We're \"welcomed\" by the waitress with retarded attitude, she threw menu on the table in the inner room and had us figured out which table we are supposed to be seated. The table is sticky, large spider net on the corner to my left. My husband and I ordered superior beef and regular beef, both looks bad when it was served - the edge for both beef turn black. I asked for a replace and was told that all their beef is the same because they have frozen these meat for a long time. During the whole meal, I couldn't feel even more uncomfortable. We're there for early dinner so we're the only two customers. The two waitress just sat on a table playing their cellphone and chat, never went back to check on us, never refill the water or refill the broth for hot pot. Towards the end of the dinner, one or the waitress coming to get stuff from the fridge by my side and kept slamming the fridge door with super loud noise, very annoying. This place is super overpriced for super low quality food. I'm just surprised that it's still on business with such service and quality of food.   To the owner: you should really train your waitress!",

If I was to come back, I would probably recommend that flavor to someone.   For both drinks, the tapioca itself was well made.

I ordered mountain milk tea with boba Reasons why I think this place sells best boba 1. milk tea is actually made from brewed tea and NOT powder (everyday noodle and rose tea cafe use powder for its milk tea)..so the tea taste much better than other places 2. Boba texture is chewy and good size of boba...to other bubble tea places I have tried (everyday noodle's boba taste really bland and not that chewy..rose tea cafe's boba is kinda small..so it doesn't give me the texture that i am looking for)   The place offers a great variety of bubble tea (different flavors of drinks and different topping including herbal jelly). Also, the cafe's ambiance reminds me of similar boba places in California.  One last thing, the cafe seems to be tucked away in a residential area so it may be difficult to spot. But If I come back to Pittsburgh, I would definitely come here for boba tea again!",

I crave hot and soupy foods quite frequently, and their hot beef noodle soup was something that hit the spot every time. The portion was generous, they didn't hold back on the spices, and the amount of beef that came with the dish sometimes made me wonder how they can be making money off of the dish. That was last year.  Ever since they've expanded their noodle soup menu (ramen and pho) their broth has thinned down quite dramatically. What used to be a thick and stocky soup now resembles that of chicken noodle soup. Also, the toppings have been cut in portion as well. I have ordered this menu item a few times since I noticed this trend, and the amount of bok choy and beef slices you get with the order has almost been halved.   Their rice dishes are okay, though I think they cost a little too much for the amount of food you get.   I can't speak for their tea and hot pot, though.",

I assume they are striving toward imitating the more native Vietnamese and Japanese styles, respectively. Our experience with the tonkotsu ramen was so-so. The composition was pretty spot-on, with a good amount of broth, soft noodles, and toppings of chashu, egg, seaweed, wood ear, bamboo, fish cake, and scallion. The taste left something else to be desired though. First was that the broth did not feel like tonkotsu at all--rather than white, creamy, savory, and meaty, it was more like plain soy sauce base, or shoyu. The second issue was that the seaweed and fish cake had overpowering flavors, despite being a smaller presence in the bowl. On the bright side, the chashu was quite tender and tasty, and there was a lot of it.",

That said it was my first bowl of ramen ever actually so could have been just the unfamiliarity of it. Hard to say but I've read someone having a similar reaction so worth noting I suppose. I'd go back for the tea at least",

I ordered a vegetarian selection and yet there was clearly a fish ball.  Also, the scallions and cilantro in the sauce bar were wilted and old.  It wasn't the worst I've had, but coupled with the bored teenager who served us, it wasn't an experience I'd want to repeat.  PS I was here on business form NYC, so maybe my expectations are high, but the price was comparable without the quality.  The boba were fine, although I wish they'd had soy milk to go with the milk teas.",

    "text": "I just got ripped off here by the server, so if the owner wants the 5 star rating back they should contact me and talk about this policy which amounts to robbing customers because of staff error.  ***  Much better than the I Claudius Cafe and the I Robot Cafe, and less popular but far superior to the I Phone Cafe and the I Pad Cafe, this is quite probably the best Bubble Tea shop in Pittsburgh, as well as having a lovely sit-down restaurant with all kinds of Taiwanese deliciousness.  There are a few good Bubble Teas to be slurped in Pittsburgh, and I Tea Cafe is my favourite of them. I come back here every time I am in town. It should be a lot more popular than it is.  What to get: Brown Sugar Milk Tea, Black Milk Tea What not to get: Tripped up by your laces. But that's what happens if, instead of tying both, you only Taiwan.  Advice: They should have some cheaper Taiwanese food options so people can get little snacks, like a half portion of their chunk chicken. They should advertise more because they have the best bubble tea in town.  If it were the ID Cafe, you'd have to be 21 to get in here. And if it were the ICU Cafe it'd be in a hospital. And if it were the IV Cafe, then they'd drip-feed Bubble Tea direct into your veins.  I love this place, their service, and their bubble teas, if not their bathroom. But I'm still very grateful for the existence of the bathroom because when I've needed it most, it's been there for me.  They have really wonderful bubble tea, especially their delicious brown sugar tea. The original black milk tea is very good too. Their lemon tea is somewhat sour much like Japanese versions of it I've had, and the winter melon that they recommend is a little weird. The service is the best in town, I would say. All in all, this is my fave bubble tea in town (Love Yogurt is second tied with Sumi's Cakery).   I will try the Taiwanese food in future, especially if I'm here with company, since they have great sit-down decor and cool tables, the whole place is resplendent with Chinese lanterns. It's a little family-owned back street place that is much more deserving of your business than a lot of the bigger name Bubble Tea shops. They have my heart and the only way you can steal it away from them is if you send me X-Rated Snaps.  They have locations in Hanover NH, Providence RI, Cambridge MA, Manhattan NY, Princeton NJ, Philadelphia PA, New Haven CT and Ithaca NY.  Oh wait, no, that's Ivy League Cafe.",

    "text": "Located in shady side, it's hard to miss this place. The check in offer should be in English , it can be confusing to customers who don't speak Chinese in Pittsburgh. They offer hot pot and boba drinks , but it's confusing because I simply thought judging by the name of the place, that it's a boba tea shop only.   I'm thoroughly annoyed that the drinks are cash only. Really????????? I get you're trying to evade taxes but like get with the program. You could charge a minimum instead at least , like $10 to use card or something. I rarely carry cash so it wasn't ideal for me. So many boba places in LA take card payment for milk tea so maybe it's a different approach on the east coast here. Idk. Expectations shattered.   The drinks are a small selection of flavors. But I did come across some flavors I don't normally see. Caramel milk tea caught my eye. The drinks are good but I think I'm just too spoilt from all the high competition in LA, that this place is hard to judge from my previous experiences at other tea shops. I mean, bonus points for having a combo of hot pot and tea shop in one, I don't think I've seen that before. Where a shop specializes in milk tea and hot pot simultaneously. I've yet to try their hot pot before I can judge.   Inside the shop was kinda small but cozy. The decor is nice and the staff seems attentive.",

As many have mentioned, this place is pretty small but cozy. We sat on a table for four and our waiter was pretty attentive.  We ordered three hotpots with the two types of meat ($16.95) with the herbal broth. I got lamb and beef which was really yummy! Service was fast as we each got individual pots and a bowl of assorted things which included: cabbage, noodles, tofu, fish ball, mushrooms, an egg, etc. (Keep in mind that it was one piece per item). I actually liked this because it gave you an opportunity to taste a bit of everything! The broth was delicious and they keep refilling as you eat. I do have to say though, the sample platter was small but you can order additional things if you want.  Remember to check in through yelp! You get a pot of tea for free which is better than tap water. I wanted to try their other dishes as everything looked so delicious! In addition,  they gave us very small bite size dessert for free!! They also had a sale of bubble tea which was buy one get one free. One of the cons was that there were too many flies which kept bugging me throughout the meal.",

The portions are great, it's enough for two servings for a small asian girl. I like the chicken, but I'm really not a huge fan of the sour vegetables that come with it (cucumbers, lettuce?).
