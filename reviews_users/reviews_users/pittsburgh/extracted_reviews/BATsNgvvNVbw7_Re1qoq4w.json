Took 30 minutes for our waiter to show up and we just order both drinks and food then. Took another 30 minutes to just get our drinks (2 beers on draft) and tables who were seated after us were served much faster then us. Finally our food came (soup, salad, boneless wings, and fries). A different server delivered the food and it looked like it had been sitting out for awhile. After being given our food we were completely ignored, along with others in our section. Us and two other tables waited over 45 minutes just to try and ask for our check (one table just got up and left!)   Being a server myself, I try to be very understanding to the wait staff. But this was ridiculous, the restaurant was not even close to busy and my section of about 5-6 tables was ignored.",

I ordered a salad, my husband a burger, and my daughter mac & cheese with broccoli. Some of my salad greens were rotting and mushy. I selected no cheese for my lactose intolerant husband, but he had to scrape two slices of cheddar off his patties. My daughter's supposedly steamed broccoli was hard and too difficult for her to eat. To add to it, my husband pulled out a dark wavy hair from his meal carton that definitely did not belong to anyone in our home. Find a different Fridays location or eat somewhere else.",

    "text": "A T.G.I. Friday's is a T.G.I. Friday's. You either like it or hate it. This location is pretty standard; it has the expected mash-up of decorations around the walls that try to give the place a laid-back lounge feel and there's nothing outstanding about the menu or what they offer food wise (and like other Friday's, it's not particularly easy to eat here if you're anything other than a meat lover).  Honestly I wasn't expecting to eat here any time soon; I had called a few days before eating here while planning a day out with friends and asked about reservations for a large group (as it says on the T.G.I. Friday's website that it's ideal to call ahead when you have a large party). However, I was told on the phone that this location does not accept reservations. So my friends and I looked elsewhere, and finally walked across the street to Friday's after discovering just how darn long the waits at other restaurants were. At least Friday's only had a 15 minute wait.  Once we were seated our meal went by pretty uneventfully. I remember that we had to repeat ourselves a lot to our waitress and I had wondered why she was having trouble hearing us, but at least she was willing to ask questions and clarify things as opposed to taking a potentially wrong order back to the kitchen. Kudos. The food, as I mentioned earlier, was standard T.G.I.Friday's. Nothing particularly wrong with it, just not that exciting either. I had actually found one of the only low-calorie items on the menu at the last minute - a steak and vegetable dish - and standard or not I was honestly pretty happy with it. My steak was surprisingly juicy, came out fairly pink and was not overcooked at all (I'd ordered a medium temperature steak), and the simple and tasty vegetables offered a nice alternative to some of the other excessive dishes I saw on the menu. Not that that mattered after I ordered a rum punch cocktail, which mixed so much rum, fruit juice, sprite and other sugary beverages together that my teeth probably rotted a little bit in my head. It was worth it, though - that drink was a sweet, tall cup of Heaven.  This T.G.I.Friday's really fits my exact definition of an \"a-ok\" place - it's not terrible, nor is it not exceptional. It's just a decent place to grab a bite or to enjoy a drink. I'd consider coming back again, but admit that they wouldn't be my first choice so much as a solid back-up plan for when other Waterfront eateries are super busy.",

My friend ordered nachos and what arrived looked like they had broken some taco shells down the middle, then put cheese and one jalapeno slice on each piece. Imagine 6 half-moons of taco shell.  Not like any nachos I've ever seen, and more importantly not even the way they were served the three prior times my friend had ordered them.",

One Sunday before going to see a movie, my friend and I decided we were going to grab a bite and chose Friday's as we both had said \"decent food, quick, and we have not been there in awhile.\"  What a mistake!  Unlike most of my other experiences at a Friday's (which was pleasant), this one was NOT that way.     AWFUL service, awful food, and awful environment... we joked that we felt like we were being served lunch in a women's prison.  Terrible!  The area they sat us in was filthy and loud and they had just opened and they were not busy.  My friend's order was completely wrong and they comped her an iced tea (what kind of a manager does that?).    Needless to say, after this experience, I will not be back to this location, but I will definitely explore the others in the area.",

We went for lunch on a Saturday. It was not crowded  We entered the restaurant and were promptly seated by a nice server.  The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated and did not feel run down or old in any way.  Our server took our drink order and returned promptly.  We got the pretzels with beer cheese appetizer and we each got a hamburger.  Our food arrived promptly and the appetizer was \"fine\".  10 years ago I would have called it good or better but time has marched on and expectations are higher then they once were.  The same goes for the main course. The fries were unremarkable but decent as were both burgers.    The bill was also fair.  The meal with two drinks and an appetizer was reasonable for what we got. The server was pleasant and attentive. All in all this Fridays as a good but likely quickly forgotten experience.  I would return here for lunch like I did today.",

Otherwise the food was great i got endless apps and it was so filling for the money. Service was excellent we had Ed and we was really great made the experience very pleasant so thank you to him.

I order the Jack Daniel's chicken and shrimp with just fries. The fries were undercooked and thrown haphazardly into the sauce holder. The shrimp was over cooked and just deepfried. The chicken was fatty and just tasted like it came from their freezer. Even the water tasted weird.  Fortunately, we had a very nice and charismatic waiter and all of the staff was very friendly.   I'd recommend the TGI Fridays out in South Hills Village over this one any day.",

    "text": "So I understand by posting here I'm admitting that I went to Fridays. Not that it's not a great place depending on your expectations.  Very convenient to the Loews waterfront theater. I'll be quick and concise. The hostess was fantastic. I wish I got her name! Saturday night February 13 neither my date nor I realized it was Valentine's Day weekend the place was slammed. Oh maybe she did, but I did not. The point was to take her son to see Star Wars. Long story short very very slow service with an attitude from the waitress. She also wore a very heavy perfume that was not only offensive but I'm sure in bad taste. While she seemed like a pleasant person outside of work (just based on conversation for a brief moment) she was not very happy tonight. She was so annoyed that we questioned the menu that she actually sat down at a chair next to us and looked at us with anticipation and perceived annoyance as to what we would order. The best part of the evening was when our entrees came. My girlfriend is a vegetarian and ordered a salad with no meat I ordered a Cobb salad. Her salad arrived via the food runner, to the table with a full load of chicken. She expressed to this individual that she was a vegetarian and while she knew he was going to take the salad back asked him not to just remove the chicken but to prepare fresh salad however she did not expect that. To our surprise the food runner was a vegetarian identified with her and brought her a completely new salad free of any animal protein. His name was Greddix. I am sure i misspelled it. However what he did not only put my girlfriends mind and myself at ease but he identified with customer need and took the opportunity to rise to the the occasion and take care of the need at hand. I am a Director of Catering at a major hotel in Pittsburgh and deal with issues like this from time to time. Kudos to Greddix! I am sure her will move on to be very successful. Great positive attitude.",

My husband ordered a Long Island and endless apps which you choose 3 out of a list in addition to him ordering a burger and everyone else also ordering meals. My daughter received her salad but was not given silverware so after waiting about 10 minutes I went to the hostess stand and asked for some because at this point she is eating with her hands lol. The hostess comes back to tell me they are rolling it and they will bring it over. A couple minutes later out waitress tosses them on our table and walks away and a food runner drops off our mozzarella sticks. The mozzarella sticks were so cold the cheese was already congealed in the center but at this point we did not care since we have been there for 50 minutes and we were just ready for food. About 10 minutes later another food runner brings out meals. We still haven't seen our waitress and my husband was never asked for another drink so he's drinking my water. I explain to the food runner we still haven't received our other apps in addition. The runner must have told our server because our server comes back and states she has to wait until we finish our first app before she can place our second app in the computer and she is still waiting for them to come out. It at this point was a good bit of time ago. I asked for boxes because we were now there over a hr and just got our food, my children are now cranky and my husband and I were so frustrated. She comes over and throws the boxes on the table no apologies and said she's gonna bring our other two apps out and she'll be back. She came back and put them on our table and handed my husband the check. I wanted to speak to a manager but my husband was so aggravated he just wanted to go. My husband and I have been in customer service and we actually met working in a restaurant, that being said this was the worst service we have ever had.",

I must say that I was very impressed with how extensive the menu was and all of the delicious options. I had the two for $10 lunch special with French onion soup and terriakyi glazed chicken strips. I was told that the broccoli soup is very thick so I opted for the French onion. It was okay but I think that I would get a salad instead of the soup next time. The chicken strips were wonderful and I am still craving them. The portion was huge and there were leftovers. My co-workers ordered the Jack Daniels Sampler and burgers and were jealous at the portion and choices from the pick two. The service was good and we had no issues. I will definitely be back.",

First, when you walk in the restaurant has a very stale grease smell that permeates throughout the restaurant, nothing visibly dirty, but smells like the entire joint needs de-greased. Second, the service, the host was a typical younger girl, efficient without too much professionalism, not a big deal. The waitress, a \"professional\" , but unfortunately not in the way of experienced great service, but moreso as experienced in efficiently moving things along.  Our food took a long time, and she 'saved' herself by telling us that she didn't know why our food wasn't ready yet, but would check again, and of course, hot plates with luke-warm food came out soon after. She reeked of cigarette smoke, so i'm going to make a dumb assumption and guess that's where she was.  The food, typical TGI-fridays food, good enough, for a chain restaurant.

    "text": "Service was very slow from the beginning.. It took a while for us to get our water. I ordered a blue raspberry slushie which also took awhile to be served. It tasted okay.. But the mango peach slushie was way better! You can change flavours!   We got the all you can eat appetizers for $10 but now you can only get refills on the same appetizer you ordered. Whereas in the past, you could change the appetizers you ordered.  So we got loaded potato skins which was delicious. The skin was crispy and the potato was soft and the cheese was so good! The bacon bits were crispy!   We trie jack Daniels and barbecue boneless wings. The jack Daniels were my favourite. They were sweet and crispy!   The potstickers were very hot when they were first served and after awhile, the skin of the potsticker was just really floury and chewy.",

    "text": "This is a nice Fridays! It is typical bar food and it can be a little pricey, but overall, it was worth it. They have a great selection of apps and their cocktails are really creative. We had the spinach and queso dip which was really good!! Our server Anastasia was super friendly and was very patient with our large group, so that was a plus!! If you're looking for a fun drink, try the Blackberry Buzz Rita; it comes with a buzz button which is an edible flower that you eat before sipping your drink. It makes your tongue tingle and it enhances the flavor of your drink. It was so cool when I tried it that everyone in our party ended up ordering a buzz button on the side with their drinks. It was such a fun and interesting experience, especially trying it with a big group! All in all, it was a great choice for really great food and drinks, and the friendly staff made this Fridays stand out from others I have been to in the past.",

My fav thing to munch on while I'm here is their BBQ Buffalo Chicken flatbread pizza. My new fav drink is their sangria'rita! It's not a sangria but it's not a Margarita. It's the best of both worlds. I have no complaints.  Fridays knows what their good at and they stick to it.",

There was a change in management and as of now we will not be going back. The last time we went we sat at the bar placed our food order and waited... FOR TWO HOURS to get our food. Mind you other people were coming in and leaving after they were served their food. We kept seeing the manager walk in to the bar area and eating something then walking away. We asked our server if we were ever going to get our food. 20 minutes later it was brought out. We didn't order anything fancy and there was no reason for that. I spoke to the manager and asked what the deal was, he said he wasn't sure that they were busy. I then pointed out he had time to eat and he said he was hungry... REALLY?? So were we... I wouldn't say the last manager was great either but at least no one had to wait 2 hours for their food. He did give our appetizer we had ordered free though. Thanks for saving me the 8 bucks for the longest dinner ever..",

Each app took over 45 mins to come out. The waitress was inattentive and unconcerned with the quality of service we were receiving. When she went to refill drinks she reused the same cups and ended up giving the wrong cups back to each of us at the table. One of the boys was given cup with a straw that had my lip stick on it (just to show how oblivious she actual was). The manager was less than concerned with our complaints and offered nothing for our less than satisfactory experience. After waiting to be seated at a table for 45 mins that was already open, waiting over 2.5 hours for our meals and the things mentioned above I wouldn't recommend going to this TGI Friday's & if you do I hope your experience was better than mine.",

    "text": "After a movie, I took my daughter to Fridays on April 9, 2017 at the Waterfront in Homestead. This is the first time at the location, usually i go to the one in Washington, PA.  After being seated, our waitress came up to out table and we ordered an appetizer, dinner and drinks.  Well we waited and waited, our appetizer never came, but our dinner did.  I ordered the ribs, and my daughter the marinated chicken sandwich.  After taking a bite, she didn't like the texture of the chicken, (tasted like it wasn't cooked all the way though) So we asked for another one. After waiting sometime, they brought out another and was told that this is how it tastes, a rubbery feeling.  So she changed her order to fish and chips.  The waitress brought out shrimp and fries.  At this point we both were disgusted with our service and asked for a manager. Again after waiting sometime we spoke to Megan, who was understanding and somewhat helpful.  They took off the chicken and appitizer, but honestly i shouldn't have paid for any of it, including my ribs, which were average.  She then proceeded to type me a letter starting that i can get $25 worth of food, at that location.  Again i called and told her that i don't ever go to that one, and have no desire to return. why couldn't you had just given me a gift card?  She then said she would call the washington location and give them my name, but why?  I wasn't heading there at the moment!  Very unprofessional, and i even called my oldest daughter who worked for Outback and she was livid, agreed i shouldn't have had to pay and got a gift card.  She also give the the DM name which i plan on reaching out. I could have and should have went to burgatory.  Much better service.  Never had this problem in Washington, which i have gone to for 7 years.",

The first was the potato skins came out with almost no bacon and it seems like the cook forgot what salt was. The main reason for 3 stars was the ribs. They just aren't any good. First problem... The membrane was still on them. Big no no. Second problem, they had to have them sitting in water to get them to where you could pull the bones apart. This takes flavor out of the meat and that was evident. And speaking of meat, there's the third problem. Where is it? I buy a rack of baby backs from the store, I can eat maybe 4 of them. Here? There's barely any meat on them. Where does it go? Friday's is a decent choice, but don't pay for ribs. They ain't worth it.",

    "text": "Now granted we were there later in the evening after a night out, but we were seated, didn't get napkins or silverware, and did get looked upon with disdain by our soon to be server.    Our soon to be server became our server and I had to ask for table set ups, and again a look of disdain.  My wife had gone gluten free vegan and the reason we come to Fridays is for the beyond meat burger. She asked for her vegetarian burger with pickle, tomato and mustard only. When her vegan burger showed up it had cheese. Who on God's green earth puts cheese on a vegan burger. And while correcting the problem a sister if one of her friends gets seated in our section.   Now our server proceeded to sit in a booth across from said sister of friend and have a long in-depth conversation about the friend, their mother and other things that I stopped listening too.   As I write this I am anxiously awaiting the return of our server to get boxes for what remains for our dismal meal and a check to pay for said dismal meal. Wish me luck for if you come here I might still be waiting, growing old and irritable, but still waiting.",

Super dead on a monday evening - staff standing around with nothing to do, yet floor looks like it needed swept. Lemon chicken was garlic overload. Cold brussels. Skunked Heineken (no surprise). Dragon chicken was good. Table near us complaining about cold food & overdone/underdone steaks. Prob won't be back.",

    "text": "When I heard about the return of endless apps, I was hooked. When I heard they implemented endless options, I immediately grabbed my wallet and ran for the nearest TGI Fridays.   Unfortunately, a bachelor's degree did not prepare me well enough to figure out that a Friday night at Friday's would be a crazy, chaotic mess. We were seated immediately, but our waitress was so occupied with 10 other tables that service suffered; however, she was very friendly and checked in on us as much as she could.   In our first round, I tackled the BBQ Chicken Flatbread (minus the chicken) and the \"Crispy\" Green Bean Fries. The flatbread was satisfying only because I was chewing at my own foot by the time the food came, but it definitely tasted like a nuked frozen pizza. Nothing was worse than the soggy, oil-soaked green bean fries. I will finish any disgusting food before I see it go to waste, but even I had to draw the line. Throwing in the white flag on this one. My second (and final) round were the Loaded Potato Skins (minus the bacon). Super crispy outside layer, but the inside tasted like a raw uncooked potato. My boyfriend breezed through four plates of boneless wings and pot stickers. The only wing flavor he enjoyed was the sriracha buffalo, while the others ranged from okay to downright disgusting. The skin to the pot stickers were so dry and chewy you could barely bite into it.   To summarize - do NOT go for the endless apps. Yeah, I saved a couple bucks, but aside from feeling like a human grease ball afterwards, nothing tasted remotely good and I wasted hours of my evening sitting in a loud, filthy restaurant. Don't make the same mistake I made.",

The welcome surprise was that the food was actually really good. And while it wasn't expensive, the service was painfully slow and disorganized. It took over 20 minutes to order and then about an hour for us to get our food. The appetizers were even slow to arrive and the first time they brought them out they were the wrong ones (more waiting!). They also brought fries instead of fruit for my kids, which the server corrected, but (you guessed it) more waiting!  If you have all day, go ahead.",

After that we sat without any contact from wait staff for over 10 minutes, multiple servers walked by our table without asking us if we'd been waited on yet. Other tables were seated around us, still no server approached our table. Walked out passed managers, servers, and host staff and nobody noticed. Went to Red Robin next door instead, should have gone there in the first place.",

After the waiter cleaned the table and floor we waited over a hour for our food. I explained to the waiter that I was a pescatarian and would like to order the Cajun shrimp pasta. However, when I received my order it was Cajun chicken and no shrimp at all. My cousin asked for the shrimp and chicken pasta and he received literally two shrimp. The manager came to speak with us but he acted as if he had no answers for us. When my food finally arrived it was completely watered down and it had no indication of Cajun in it. I left without eating after sitting for almost two hours. The place was not even half full I'd hate to see how the service would have been had the restaurant been completely full. I will not be back as I would not recommend anyone else to visit this location!!!!",

    "text": "Today we dined indoors after a bike ride on the rail trail.  I realized I'd never been inside before, only out on the deck facing the trail/river.  While I love the outdoors and would always choose that first, it wasn't available today so inside we go.  This particular Friday's is nice inside with space between tables.  The one in Monroeville seems quite a bit more cramped.    The purpose of this update is to brag about their burger.  OMG! This was the best burger I've enjoyed for quite some time.  I've been to specific burger joints that just simply try too hard and either I've had bread components that fell apart immediately upon being held or various edible entities on the burger that just didn't go well together or overpowered the burger itself.    Here, I opted for the \"your call burger\" in which you select a cheese, a spread, and 2 toppings for 11.95 and it comes with fries.  I opted for Smoked Gouda for my cheese, the Truffle Aioli for my spread and Onion-Bacon Jam and Crispy Cajun Onions for my toppings.  Note that the spread comes on the side which is nice as I didn't use very much.    Again, let me rave about it and tell you this is the best burger I've had in a long time.  The burger was moist and juicy and well-complemented by the cheese/toppings/spread/bun.  I ate every morsel plus the fries plus a small side salad and was a happy diner.  That is all.  Thank you.",
