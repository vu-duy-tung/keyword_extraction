    "text": "A co-worker surprised me with a lunch today and took me to one of his favorite downtown lunch spots, located in the Omni William Penn Hotel. We were warmly greeted and led right to a table. I was in the mood for a salad and the waiter very patiently talked me through what I might mix and match to get just the right salad I was craving.   A variety of carb-a-licious breads were served with oil and herbed butter options. I'm a heavy water drinker and often find myself parched in restaurants after chugging my first glass. The servers were very attentive and filled my water without prompting so much that I thought I may float back to the office. No ice though, which I noticed right away and found interesting....  My salad was pretty boring, mostly because that's how I requested it, but it still lacked that little something extra that makes you say 'Damn, that's a fine good salad!'. Didn't have a dessert, but they looked impressive as I was jealously watching the other tables being served theirs.    Don't let my boring meal sway you, my companion raved about the food here (lobster mac & cheese, eggplant & zucchini ravioli, oh my!) and the menu options looked very tempting.",

This is a legitimately great eating option.  I really like Pittsburgh and i particularly like the dining options and this place is able to do breakfast, lunch and dinner well.  I even did high Tea and that was terrific.  It's great for meetings and solitary meals.",

It was pretty empty, so we figured the quality had gone way down. NOT SO!! Our waiter was personable, knowledgeable, and attentive. He was super accommodating, even with my restrictive diet. My table mates each had an appetizer, each excellent. When our mains came, I had a problem and started to ask the waiter what I could do. He called the chef who was Exceptionally responsive, got a thorough understanding of my condition and needs and rocked the best meal I've had in months (I live in LA and just got back from a trip to Vegas where I dined at 5 star places.. I have a high bar). I came, I enjoyed, I even learned! Shame it is so empty on a Friday night- this place, and this chef especially, deserve some attention. Mark my words, this guy will go far.",

    "text": "The service was horrendous. We were told there was a wait inside and we could sit outside in the hotel lobby but still be served. It took 10 minutes and us flagging down someone before we were able to order drinks and tell them we wanted to brunch buffet. We were given the breakfast menu where the menu says the buffet is $20 including coffee and juice. Unfortunately we were charged much more for the Sunday brunch buffet and extra for coffee. We were being served by the bartender who was also making drinks at the bar and clearly overwhelmed. We had to ask the hostess for silverware and napkins after we had been to the buffet. She said \"yes, what do you need?\" I said we need all of it since we were given nothing and had to seat ourselves outside. Because the bartender was so busy, it took about ten minutes to get anything including coffee and orange juice.  Almost everything that we got from the buffet was sub par and the best thing I had was the muffins which I could have purchased at the Starbucks in the lobby.  The eggs were cold, the biscuit was hard, turkey was mushy and cold, and the gravy was dried out. Not a satisfactory meal at all and extremely upsetting to know we were paying so much for food that was not good at all.  I felt bad for the bartender who was really trying but overall, this experience was very disappointing since we were staying in the Omni and thought Sunday brunch would be fun here! You live and you learn though.  We don't live in Pittsburgh so we probably wouldn't go back anyway but I would definitely pick a different brunch/breakfast place in the future.",

The second best thing is that they take reservations for lunch and you can be in and out within in an hour.  I end up here often for lunches with colleagues and for what it lacks in creativity it makes up for in comfort.  The room is beautiful and classic with mostly natural light.  It's an all around perfectly pleasant place to eat a  leisurely 15-25 dollar lunch.  The sandwiches/salads are all completely predictable, but never fail to satisfy and usually you have to bring half home.  The desserts are nice and probably the most innovative of all the menu items.  I've on occasion tried their lunch entrees and usually don't think they're worth the price for lunch, but that's just me.",

    "text": "I really, really, really wanted to like this place!  I brought my two daughters here for afternoon tea service as a little treat for us over Christmas break.  I'm glad that they are such wonderful sports.  I was just a bit unimpressed by this alleged high tea service.  You're certainly paying for the ambience - and not much else.  There are 3 options for afternoon tea service:  - standard service for $17 for 3 very small tea sandwiches, 2 scones, 3 petit fours and a pot of tea - Royal service for $24 - everything above plus your choice of a champagne cocktail, kir royale or a mimosa - Mad Hatter tea service for $10 (kids 10 and under) - includes 2 cookies, one small PB&J and a small banana sandwich  The service was very inattentive.  It took about 10 or 15 minutes for our server to arrive and take our order.  With only 3 items on the menu, there's not much suspense here for the server.  There's a pretty good chance I'm going with one of the two tea options and since I came with two girls aged 4 and 7, they're going with the kid version.    The treats were tasty enough, small portions and it took quite a while for them to arrive.  The kids were pleased as can be to be on this outing and they were just taking it all in, as they should.  Daddy on the other hand was wondering where our server was with my check and then what was taking so long to process my payment.  When I hear afternoon high tea service, I was hoping for something along this lines of this recent experience in Victoria, British Columbia at The Fairmont: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-fairmont-empress-victoria-2#hrid:xpD2ILdG1yszsgbdTKHtsw\">yelp.com/biz/the-fairmon...</a>  Judging from the other reviews, clearly this hotel is an institution.  But, for the price, I was hoping for something more in the food and service departments.    You can come out ahead if you just sat in the lobby and ordered a tea and scone from the Starbucks that shares the same space.",

    "text": "Visited on 03-01-11. Review applies to lunch menu.  The Terrace Room resides in a beautiful old building positively dripping with dignity: the William Penn Hotel. The restaurant itself enjoys those same attributes by association. Vaulted ceilings with a beautiful design, elaborate chandeliers. The room manages to have grandeur without lapsing into self mockery (like say, Alex in Las Vegas).  An initial breading has boon companions in the form of herbed butter (soft, avoiding my pet peeve of scraping rock hard butter over delicate bread) and olive oil side by side in a purpose-designed dish. I had a slice despite my mild gluten intolerance; stomach cramps never tasted so good. Despite the tasteful presentation, the bread fell a bit short by being served cold.  I opted for the heirloom tomato Napoleon as an appetizer, a decision I reveled in. This is basically a vertically-constructed caprise salad; a skyscraper of tomato and mozzarella. Healthy slices of beautiful red and yellow heirloom tomatoes alternate with generous slabs of mozzarella cheese shuffled in. A crispy basil leaf on top adds texture and a strangely satisfying crunch, reminiscent of treading upon fall leaves. A drizzle of mild basil vinaigrette finishes off this terrific course. This is a must-have; absolutely one of the best caprise salads I have had the occasion to enjoy.  Pittsburgh is a city that loves it's French Fries. Hell, I could not even find a SALAD without them. Well, when in Rome, as they say. I ordered the hangar steak (my favorite cut of meat) with fries (although in a class joint like The Terrace Room they call them Pommes Frites).   The steak arrived pre-sliced. Although it was clearly sliced post-cooking, I would have preferred to do that myself. The pile of meat, although very generous, paled next to the haystack of fries set next to it on the oblong platter. A smothering of perfectly-sauteed onions sat atop the hangar steak; just enough for each slice of meat to have a few companions in my digestive track, certainly not enough to overwhelm.  The chefs at The Terrace Room clearly have their act together; this steak was a True medium-rare, perhaps even erring on the side of rare. I realize that to some this might be a turn-off. Hence, I mention it. For me it's just great kitcheneering! For those who have not had a Hanger Steak, it has a slightly gamey, almost organy taste. This isn't a sirloin, no sir. The specimen at the Terrace Room was a archetypical example of its breed, and the course itself very French Bistro-esque.  I feel compelled to make particular note of the service: Understated yet attentive and friendly without being solicitous; always there at the right time, and never there when they should not have been. The courses were brought promptly with excellent timing between courses.   Overall, I could not be happier with my dining experience.",

The service was impeccable (as was the hotel stay) and the food was lovely.   I had the roasted pear and arugula salad.  In a city that puts French fries on their salads this was a breath of fresh air.  The salad was amazing, it had a light sherry vinaigrette, bleu cheese crumbles and caramelized walnuts! My dinning companion had a pan seared salmon with garlic cream sauce, veggies and bazmatti rice.   She raved about it the rest of the trip.   We shared a HUGE piece of strawberry shortcake - which was also amazing.  If you are in town this is a great place to go, they also serve High Tea in the afternoons by reservation.",

After over a hour had to get up and look again for him to say if we don't get our food in the next five minutes we have to leave for the show. Food came out salmon wasn't cook all the way. Everything looked like it was sitting under heat lamp. Four of the dinners were the prime rib steak special which was half the portion we were told and it was prime rib roast not steak.  Missing the special sauce he kept mentioning.  Potatoes were ice cold. The food tasted like banquet food and  not good banquet food. Very disappointing for a great four star hotel.",

It's a really cute idea; they have a nice selection of teas (vanilla rooibos yum!!), everyone gets three little sandwiches, and then the delicious desserts. Everything was lovely but with one exception that leaves me feeling ehhh. When my mom called to make the reservation, she was asked if there were any dietary restrictions. We do have a dairy allergy in our family, and that was relayed. We had to tell the waiter again prior to ordering, and our milk allergy was still given a sandwich with cheese on it. The sandwiches seem to be pre made (not the most fresh by 3pm), so maybe was really nothing they could do, but that leads me to wonder why even ask about diets when there is no change that you're willing to make? Also, knowing we had the allergy in our party, no changes were made to the desserts, so our allergy girl didn't eat any out of precaution.  Like I said, everything was really lovely and our allergy girl still had a nice time, I just don't understand the dietary issue, and because of that I'm not sure if I would return for tea.",

Glass doorways, a grand piano, high painted ceilings, and tapestries that lend to the atmosphere of timeless opulence.   The food is pricey, and fancy, but with some playfulness.  At brunch we got house made fudge choco tacos for dessert, and the burgers and sandwiches at lunch are low on pretension and high on flavor.  The decor and atmosphere is so outrageously good, that it's actually hard for the staff and food to compete.  Don't get me wrong, they're certainly good, but unlike the decorations, I wouldn't call them the best in the city.  You'll come for the food, but it's the ambiance that will keep you coming back.",

    "text": "I wish I could write 2 reviews for this place one for Sunday brunch and one for for dinner last night. So I did my best to average out the stars and I landed at 3.   For starters this place is beautiful. From the amazing painting on one wall, to the ceiling and the white cloth tables this place screams classy. Both times we've been here the decore has not disappointed. The breakfast here was great. Maybe the best hotel breakfast I've been to. The food is fresh and other then waiting at the omelet station for about 5 min before flagging someone down to get someone to make me an omelet I really can't complain. Now onto last night dinner.   Walking in there was barley any tables taken. We had a reservation but it certainly wasn't needed. We were seated at a table with a booth on one side and a chair on the other. It was a cozy little corner. When we opened the menu we noticed it was very different from the one listed on the site. It was a bit disappointing. I know it's only August but pumpkin fritters sounded amazing. Bry ordered a beer and asked for the restaurant week menu. Which wasn't provided with the menu and when we did get it it was a bit worse for wear. Several min later the waiter came back and asked for the restaurant week menu so he could show it to the chef... So apparently it was the only restaurant week menu they had. When the waiter came back we asked if the chef was ok with the restaurant week menu. The waiter said yes and the the head chef had left so the sous chef was I charge. This didn't sound promising. Alas We decided to go with one of each of the option for restaurant week. At this point Bryan was done with his beer and it was a good 30 min and our waiter had passed our table several times and didn't even notice. Also we were brought bread in that 30 min. The bread was good but was cold and would have been much better warm. There was also no explanation of what it was. I think one was a rustic olive bread and then the other was a bread stick with asiago cheese? Maybe? And the butter had herbs in it but I couldn't tell you what they were. It just tasted like butter to me. When the first course came out the waiter noticed the empty beer glass and asked what he could get us. Bry ordered another beer and we ordered a bottle of wine. The wine was really the best part of the meal. Ok so onto the food. The Brie tart was fantastic. The flavors were bright and I wish I could have had like 2 more. The lobster ravioli was ok. The bacon on it was more chewy then crispy and the ravioli itself was undercooked just a little. The main dishes were steak and pasta. The steak was to salty and the sweet corn custard it was on was the best part. The agnolotti looked really pretty when it came out but it was so undercooked it was sad. I sent it back and the kitchen remade it. I didn't even bother with a pic because I was still very hungry I just dug in. The lemon was to strong and the artichoke was undercooked. It was just a very sad dish but the potential for a good dish is there. I was disappointed. Several min later a manager came over and apologized about the food. We asked about the chef situation and apparently the head chef left to another property and is now In charge of several Omni restaurants. He was genuinely wanting to make our experience better and said he would take all the food off the bill. Dessert was good. The poor guy at the table next to us had the same thing and it blew up a bit and got all over his shirt. So we were warned. The pavlova was good and I enjoyed the berries with just a hint of lemon. It was good and the creamy white chocolate off set it nicely.   We definitely didn't get the amazing food and romantic dinner we were hoping for. Did I mention the street light glaring in my eyes for most of dinner. Hopefully the get a head chef soon. I appreciate the effort from management to try and rectify the situation. He also was at several other tables that night. I'm guessing doing the same thing. This place could really be a great restaurant.  The potential is there but a great head chef is needed. Hopefully there able to work it out. Well prob give it another try since we left the gift card we were going to use at home. Hopefully the kitchen issues are worked out by then.",

    "text": "Tonight's experience was possibly one of the worst I have had at a restaurant in Pittsburgh in a long time.   I took a client here before the pens game. We sat down at 6pm and thought that we would have plenty of time for an 8pm game. We were wrong!!!!   The place had maybe 10 tables and the rest was empty.   Our waiter barely spoke English. I could not even understand what the specials were so I didn't even have a chance to try one of them.   I ordered a glass of Pinot noir which was terrible. It tasted bitter and was probably open for a few days.   Our salads actually arrived pretty fast. But my lettuce was brown and wilted.  After waiting over an hour the manager came over and apologized for the tardiness. She said our meal would be out in 3 minutes. Ten minutes later it arrived.   I ordered the burger med rare. And it came out extra well done. It was so dry! The cheese was not melted and the bacon was not what I expected. The bacon was not traditional strips and were small, hard, pea size pieces. They ended up falling off and worthless. After three bites I had to stop eating it.   The waiter came over and saw I was not eating me meal. To my surprise he asked if I wanted more broccoli.  The funny part was there were only 4 pieces of broccoli. In all my dining experiences... I have never been asked if I wanted more of the sides on my plate. Not to mention I barely ate my nasty burger.   By this point I was so frustrated that we just wanted our check so we could get to the pens game.   Worst service, worst food.... Never again!   I hope they read this and reach out to me. As the only way to make up for it is with a free hotel night with the wife. Because I will never eat at either of these places again. And I work right across the street!",

I love the beautiful mural on the wall The beautiful filigreed ceiling and the overall opulence of the William Penn.

I have high expectations for a burger, and realistically should have had something else, however the person I was with recommended it. I had the Hog's Pond and she had the Salmon BLT.  All in all is go back, but this time trying something different. I really want this place to wow me with service and food like the setting/room already does.",

That said, this drinking and dining area seems much more acquainted for a tea party and sophisticated talks (not bad things...just not my cup of tea...yes, pun intended).    All said, the place is worthy of a stop as it offers solid service, a simple hotel menu with decent food, and a small, but suitable bar.  If you're in the downtown area and aren't rushed, this is a pretty, good stop for a nice drink, reasonable eats, and high class conversation.",

We arrived promptly for our reservation and was surprised to find the dining room near full.  We were seated at our requested banquet seat and given menus.  The menu offered special beverages, I got a sage advice which was Prairie Vodka mix, pineapple juice muddle with fresh sage and lemon juice.  So yummy.  For our entrees, I selected maple glazed ham with apple and cherry chutney and fingerling potatoes.  BJ got the open face croissant with lobster, shrimp, fried green tomatoes, asparagus, and roasted tomato aioli.  Included with our meals was the appetizer station, which included fresh berries, yogurt, granola, salmon, charcuterie, Asian shrimp & glass noodle salad, farro, nicoise and Mediterranean salads.  Everything was perfectly prepared and very delicious.  Saving the best for last was the dessert station.  I loved the fresh made crepes, we were able to select our choice of fillings and sauces.  There was also a selection of mini desserts that included cupcakes and cookies.  The best part was BJ got a kiss from the Easter Bunny!  It's becoming a tradition for us to enjoy our holiday meal at The Terrace Room.",

Our waiter barely seemed to understand English and had no knowledge of the menu. We inquired about their \"old blue eyes\" tea and he was completely lost. The food took a long time to come out. I understand that for a larger party, food can take a while, but one of our party waited at least fifteen minutes longer than the rest of us for the exact same dish that other people ordered.  I also got the bolognese pasta, which was horrifically overpriced at $25, but I hoped that the quality would be worth the splurge. But oh no--some of the pasta was completely undercooked and actually CRUNCHED in my mouth. The sauce had no flavor and tasted like it came out of a can. I would have been upset to pay even $10 for it. The french onion soup was reasonably priced, but it did not have a nice cheese melt on the top, but rather some globs of melted but not crispy cheese. Did not look like the photos other Yelp users have posted. Then it took a frightening amount of time for the waiter to ask about dessert. By that point we were fed up with waiting and just wanted our checks so we could leave. We were all superbly annoyed by the auto gratuity added to the check for the party size because we all agreed that the waiter did nothing to deserve it between being not being able to place/understand an order, getting the food out late, and completely ignoring us otherwise. The service was utterly abominable, particularly when compared to the high-end prices, venue, and atmosphere.",

The tables from the restaurant that spill out into the hotel lobby are ideal for people watching.   The complimentary breakfast buffet has an AMAZING spread that most complimentary hotel breakfasts would never offer including Do-It-Yourself smoked salmon & smoked ham bagel sandwiches with gourmet cream cheeses, build your own omelette station, breakfast pastries that are so flaky you can hear the crisp when you bite into them, and various fruit and nut butters for all kinds of breads and toasts-- just to name some of the selection! If that doesn't satisfy you, can order from a menu which is also included in your breakfast voucher.  We also had High-Tea on a Saturday afternoon that was very pleasant. For $17 per person you get a tiered stand with assorted sandwiches, scones, petit-fours, with fruit jams, clotted cream, and a personal pot of tea. Delightful!

To begin, our waiter was a rude and inattentive older man with a serious attitude. When I tried to ask a question about the menu, he gave me a dirty look and walked away. It took them good 45 min to bring out our appetizers. Mine was scallops which were already cold. I'd think that for $18 for 3 scallops and 4 completely burnt Brussels sprouts they could have at least kept them warm. For main course, which again took them almost an hour to bring out, I had a hanger steak. Once again, it was cold and meat was completely dried out even so I ordered it medium rare.  The only positive comment I have about that place is about the drinks. They make killer Manhattans, although they charge $20 for them.  I honestly have no clue how that place still stays open or how it gets good reviews.  Don't waste your money!",

The final straw was when we waited for our dessert course. After placing the order they were out of one of the items so my husband just picked the same dessert as mine. After another painful wait for it to arrive they finally brought out one and said the other wasn't ready yet. After waiting 5 minutes we finally just shared the individual dessert. When we were finished and the second was still not ready, we had to get it to go. All in all we were there for over 2 hours. Inexcusable.",

Left within 10 minutes after unfortunate service. A few minutes after being seated our waitress came by, greeted us, poured water and then left to clean up another table. After waiting a few more minutes and having no follow up from our server and seeing other parties looking around waiting, we left. Was very disappointed by all of this, given it was nowhere near packed. Ended up walking to Proper Brick Oven & Tap Room, where I know the food and service are great.",

The brunch starts at 11 and includes a 3 course meal with a cocktail. We started off with a mimosa with basil and a gin lemonade.- it was strong so you were warned. For our first course I went with the Greek yogurt which came with strawberries and granola. My date went with biscuits and gravy with mushrooms. They were the perfect appetizer size and rave reviews all around. For my entree I went with the traditional Pittsburgh breakfast which came with 2 eggs cooked to your liking, potatoes, bacon or sausage and toast. My date got the steak and fries which came on a bed of lettuce. The steak was a nice sliced portion that was cooked to perfection. If that was not enough there was still dessert. I ordered a blueberry scone which was served warm. We also got the apple turnover served warm with ice cream-it was decadent. Our waitress was fantastic, the food was served quickly between courses and the restaurant was just lovely!",

Woo hoo!  I rolled in for dinner pretending to be fancy like the other guests in a dress and was seated in a quiet corner with my mass of reading materials. The server came around and took my orders quickly and efficiently, but wasn't particularly chatty. The busperson, though, was super cool. He came around to chat, offer bread and make sure I was doing alright. At the end of the meal, I lamented the fact that I didn't get to try all three of the delicious breads. He went back to the kitchen and returned with an entire to-go box of breads for me to take along with me. Super awesome! To anyone who may be curious, I got the mushroom polenta and it was seriously delicious!!  The next morning, I returned for breakfast and got a server who was new to the restaurant. He was polite as could be and didn't even judge me for showing up in a Pens t-shirt and shorts. I ordered eggs benedict, which came with a cute little tart and hash browns. I highly recommend the fresh squeezed orange juice--one of my favorite treats.",

We came for a friends birthday, we of course all got alcoholic drinks with our tea service. Opting for the $32.00 Tea, Kir Royal here i come.  Our poor water accidentally dropped a glass of champagne and the whole tray (only two drinks) also fell and spilled everywhere. He seemed flustered by this, but we didn't really mind too much. Shit happens, honestly.  My tea was fine. Everyone seemed pleased with their tea and cocktails.  The sandwiches were not really anything to write home about.  Waldorf Chicken Salad on a tiny croissant, egg salad with pimento on pumpernickle, and then cucumber and smoked salmon with cream cheese. I wouldn't have gone back for seconds even if it was an option. I was dissatisfied with the food. The sweets came - for a group of 8 we got 2 towers - neither had the same macarons on them. The sweets were ok. Nothing too difficult or impressive but they seemed lack luster for the price we paid for tea. Our scones were my biggest issue. They weren't very good. They were more like dry biscuits and I would have liked to have some lemon curd, real clotted cream, and preserves instead of the options we were offered. The scones were blue berry or plain. I was not a fan of either really. When our bill came it was $80.00 for my fiance and I's tea service.  For the price we paid, I'd have expected a bit more than just bland sandwiches and grocery store sweets.",

The oysters were Blue Point oysters-- which was pretty 'meh' if you're an oyster fanatic. However, what impressed us was that whoever shucked the oysters did a stupendous job. The oysters were clean (none of those grits and grinds that you often encounter when eating oysters) and fall nicely off the shell into your mouth. Their cocktail sauce is also to die for (so make sure you ask for it!). Additionally, they offer a competitively priced $3/glass of champagne to pair with the oysters. What a steal!    Regular priced appetizers are 50% off during their happy hour. We only ordered the tuna tartare, which I do not recommend. The appetizer as a whole was very bland. The tuna had no seasoning or sauce to accompany, and the mixed arugula and spinach side salad didn't come with any dressing. I would skip this and try your luck on their other appetizer options!",

I ordered the Tradition Eggs Benedict, the Hollandaise sauce was extremely creamy and rich and the egg was perfectly cooked. My other friends ordered the Crab Cake Benedict and based off the mouthful I had...I wish I would have ordered it myself. The crab cake was perfectly seasoned and paired well with the Hollandaise sauce.   As a treat, we also ordered desserts. I ordered the Nutella Pot De Creme, it was like scooping a cloud of deliciousness with a biscotti. The others in our party ordered the delicious and flavorful Prantl's Burnt Almond Torte and Grilled Peach Cobbler. The torte had a perfect coating of almonds on a heavenly bed of buttercream. The cobbler was delicious and was a nice dish for those who cherish a naturally sweet taste over an overly sugary dish, but it doesn't hold a candle to the Torte or Nutella Pot. The wait staff was extremely courteous, professional and timely. You receive a lot of food for the price and I definitely had to take some back home with me. We will definitely be visiting again!",

For us, we came in with a groupon for afternoon high tea, and there were virtually no complaints there. We had a reservation for a weekday, although it was empty enough to appear unnecessary. There was no one at the receptionist counter when we arrived, although someone came out shortly to seat us.  All the tables set aside for high tea already had all the waters, cups, plates, cream, rock sugar, and jams arranged on them. Our waitress was nothing but polite the entire time. She took our groupon first thing, gave us the tea menu and some recommendations, and off we went. We enjoyed our Cherry Blossom Green, which had a lasting sweet note, as well as Old Blue Eyes, which was very fruity. She even explained briefly how to use the tea filter, and they refilled the tea pots with hot water halfway through.  The accompanying pastries were great as well. There were some small sandwich pieces to start with--nothing outstanding, but still tasty. The macarons, scones, and other confections that came after were very good. The waitress gave us a recommendation on jams to go with the scones that turned out nicely, while the macaron and other sweets were flaky and creamy.  Add to all this the impressive decor of this place, and we had a very pleasant afternoon inside the hotel.",

We made sure they were open because there were only a few other patrons, and our sever assured us that they would be open for quite a while. We ordered a round of drinks after being asked twice by our server if we were ready to order (if we're all still looking through the drink options, chances are we're not ready).   The drinks came out quickly enough and were made well. I have to take into consideration the location when I'm judging the price ($13) of a drink, and I would say that it was average for downtown.   What irked me the most was our server. We told her that we were only having drinks, and yet she kept coming by at what seemed like four minute intervals to ask if we wanted anything even though it was clear that we were still in the middle of our drinks. I really felt like I was being pressured to order more or get the hell out.   The location is absolutely beautiful, but it was hard to sit with friends and enjoy the surroundings and conversation with constant interruptions. I think we would have stayed for another round, but the pushy server made it seem like we should take our business elsewhere...which we did.",

The food was just alright: my turkey was thick-cut and dry; one friend said he hated his steak, but did not elaborate, the other loved his salmon. The sides were fine, though the green beans seemed not to have been cooked at all, merely warmed through. I don't want the typical casserole mush, but the moment at which green beans are done is also the moment at which you can no longer hear them when you chew on them.   These things aren't why I'm bothering to Yelp, however. Dessert was my real issue. Instead of offering individual portions of the three desserts they featured on the menu, the Terrace Room put before us a plate of what would have been respectable individual portions of all three desserts on offer, pumpkin pie, pecan pie, and a cinnamon-apple crisp, which we were expected to share. Naturally, we all wanted the cinnamon-apple dessert.  When I read the menu before making my reservation, I assumed I'd be able to choose the crisp, and my two friends would be able to choose whichever of the three desserts they wanted. One of the reasons I choose to go to a restaurant for Thanksgiving is that it's generally a good way to avoid being fed pumpkin pie, which I loathe, and which many, many home cooks have tried to force on me over the years, saying \"Oh, you just THINK you hate pumpkin pie--that's because you haven't had MY pumpkin pie.\" Well, thanks Terrace Room, for force-serving us pumpkin pie (we left most of it on the plate).  Now...where shall I eat next Thanksgiving?",

They have the most ecsquisitte buffet I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Indulge yourself some morning and be sure to bring your appetite. Bit of advice, if you love someone, bring them here.   The atmosphere: historic and grand With large ornate Chandeliers and detailed ceiling was very interesting  The decor is somewhat dated but thats expected The staff was both polite and professional   Tips for the buffet:  Head straight for the butter and jam spread don't forget an omelette, gravy, and breakfast potatoes. Stay clear of the pancakes, they are a bit spongy and dry.",

Had been here 2 years ago while visiting from Denver and the menu had not changed. The ambiance is classic for a 1011 y/o Hotel, but it is tired and not truly clean.  Honestly, I made notes in my open table reservation that it was my Dad's 90th and expected them to make him feel more special.  Been there, done that, will not return. When I walked over to the Hotel Monaco, where we are staying, we were warmly greeted, the Hotel is buzzing, warm, & friendly, as is their restaurant. I will not return to the Terrace Room or the William Penn.",

I got the Baltimore Benedict ($19) and the flavor was delicious but it was overall pretty gooey as there was no English muffin or bread base, just the crab cake, poached egg, and hollandaise but the side of potatoes was a nice relief. Overall if you're staying in the hotel give it a try otherwise you might be better off else where for the price.",

Coming to the food, We ordered the Crispy Calamari as an appetizer. It was clearly microwaved, dry and so disappointing. The waiter was nice but I wish that was enough.  We still didn't give up hope, and ordered Serenity Hill Farms Chicken and Jumbo Lumo Crab Cakes. The chicken was tasteless and seemed old, hard. The crab cakes were soft, better and the patty that came with the crab cake we alright. The char grilled asparagus on the side was nice.  Overall given the prices, it was completely not worth it.

I understand that the Omni William Penn is a historic building however, I think it could use a lot of updates. Just because something is old, doesn't mean it has to look like it. Everything in the beautiful room could be updated. The colors seemed really faded and even the beautiful flowers just blended right into the background.   The afternoon tea was subpar. The service was extremely slow and the pastry chef does not seem to be well versed in simple baking techniques. The scones were way too flat and hard- I think they might've forgot to include baking powder in the recipe. When the food was presented, no one explained what each item was. I was extremely underwhelmed with the food. A few items were decent however, nothing was unique or outstanding.   Would I recommend this place for a tea outing? No. When I am attending a tea service, I am expecting decadent food in an equally luxurious atmosphere. The service was extremely slow and did not seem that attentive. The food was average and the decor was too stuffy and outdated.",

The drinks and appetizers were served timely and all guests were happy with the soup and salad selection.  The salad was well dressed with blue cheese crumbles, candied pecans, and bacon. Very tasty.   Unfortunately after the salad, the main course took over 70 minutes past the appetizer, and not once did a wait staff stop by to offer additional drinks while we waited.  The steaks and swordfish were enjoyed by all guests, properly cooked and with large potatoes and squash for sides. Fortunately, the filet mignon was tender enough to cut with a butter knife because we were never given steak knives.   The dessert special was lackluster with a strange combination of flavors. It was a peach gelato with a pour of tonic water, black berries and honey. It was very tart and the honey had gelled at the bottom of the glass.   Ultimately would not go back due to the abysmal service.  If we could get the same quality food with better service we would go back.",

It's got the hotel pricing, to be sure, and the food is excellent but not exactly an original cuisine/menu. But you'll enjoy the service, the sweeping ceilings, the magnificent mural, and general atmosphere as a time traveling adventure to another era.  I also met with friends on the \"bar\" side when a private event was being held in the main room, and the bar service was impeccable.  Note for guests at the hotel: they only have one kitchen for all their food options and room service, so the secret hint is you can order anything on any of the menus if you ask, even if it's not on that particular room's physical menu.",

Unfortunately the service has pretty steadily gone downhill every year, except one year it was exceptionally bad. Despite that, we return every year because of the merry atmosphere in the lobby. We always opt for the Royal Tea, which comes with the addition of a champagne cocktail.   This year, the sandwiches were quite delicious and the scones were warm when they came out. So that was a huge plus. But the service just doesn't follow suit... we typically spend upwards of 2.5 hours at tea, and we would go about 30-45 minutes without our server(s) checking on us, pretty unacceptable if you ask me.",

This hotel screamed history from the moment I waked in, which was awesome.  There were plenty of seating, and the architecture was really amazing, They have original molded plaster ceiling with mahogany arches. Beautiful chandeliers and elegant atmosphere. This restaurant was opened in 1916, and I got to peek into the history even just a little but by being in this space.  The variety of the buffet was pretty nice, I was liking what I was seeing. They had eggs, pancakes, bacon, sausage, biscuits & gravy, and so much more. What I enjoyed the most was their smoked salmon. Very fresh and tasty!  Unfortunately, I was not super hungry, so I didn't get as much as I wanted to try. I did get some eggs, breakfast potatoes, smoked salmon, blueberry maple sausage patty, mini muffin and fresh fruits. They were all pretty tasty and I had no complaints. Their special sausage patty was juicy and packed with flavor, and smoked salmon was meaty and fresh. They were not amazing, but I was happy with their offerings.  The server was very nice and friendly. Food was better than I expected, especially the selections. I wish if I was hungry enough to have more... Regardless, I had a nice breakfast here, surrounded by rich history.",

    "text": "My two girlfriends and I had talked about doing High Tea at the Omni William Penn for a couple months and settled on reservations for the first Saturday after the holidays. I had never been to High Tea and was so excited to have this experience for the first time.  I know that reservations can be hard to obtain at times, so I was surprised when the three of us were literally the first to arrive a bit before 2:30pm. We were given the best table in the house - a lovely table overlooking the grand entrance of the hotel tucked away in a private corner. If our early arrival gave us the best seat in the house, I'll make sure to be early again in the future!  The entire experience was a lot of fun. Our waiter first brought us the teas to sniff, a wooden box filled with vials of all the teas that could be ordered. I had had my eyes on the Organic Vanilla Rooibos but made a last minute decision to switch to the Flowery Earl Grey. I love Lady Grey Tea, and this tea was reminiscent of those flavors but so much more delicious!  The meal first started with a trio of sandwiches - smoked salmon with cream cheese served in a small pastry, a classic ham and cheese on white bread, and a tortilla wrap with goat cheese. All three sandwiches were nice, but the tortilla wrap threw me a bit. It just didn't seem to belong with the others or as a part of a classic tea...  After our sandwiches, a tower was delivered to the table showcasing plain and lemon-blueberry scones accompanied by two jams and creme fraiche, petite fruit kabobs, and three desserts including a white chocolate basil macaroon, a chocolate cup, and a fruit tart. The highlight of this tower was the scones, which were divine! They somehow had a soft center while maintaining a crisp snap on the exterior. The flavors were delicious, too. The chocolate cup dessert was hands down my favorite dessert option, while the white chocolate basil macaroon was an unfortunate add to the tower. The three of us almost made a face after we each bit into the macaroon. The flavor combination just tasted a bit jarring and unpleasant.  Planning a girls date for High Tea at the Omni William Penn is the perfect way to spend a Saturday afternoon! I look forward to coming back here again in the future.",

    "text": "My wife and I took my 87 year old mom there last Saturday for brunch. I had made reservations for noon and arrived 20 minutes early. When I went up to the host stand the woman there asked me if I had a reservation.I replied \"I have a RESO for 3 at noon\" At which point, she started scrolling down her list telling me it's not there. I pointed to my name clear as day and she replied that my name was RESO! And it's not there. I had to explain to this megabrain that RESO is Restaurant industry speak for reservation. The Matire'D finally came over and sat us in a terrible table smack dab in front of the devastated smelly breakfast buffet. Not only was it a mess but people were still attacking it, dropping dirty implements on the floor and making all kinds of clanging noises. I thought good thing mom is 87 and can't hear or smell so good. The water, even with multiple lemons tasted of the Allegheny with a heavy dose of chlorine. For the price, it would be nice to at least have filtered water. Disgusting.  Then this extremely irritating server guy shows up and has his hands on mom's shoulder and refers to her and my wife as Miss or Missy? I made a comment about it being inappropriate but he continued throughout the meal. Mom is on a restricted diet, so we asked for a grilled chicken breast and no sausage gravy. We got the grilled chicken but it was swimming in sausage gravy. The waiter took the food back and served her no syrup for her waffle. What an idiot! I had to get syrup off the buffet. Wife had steak frites which was a very small flat iron steak which was over cooked and sliced served with a BBQ sauce? Thats not European!?!? My wife has been a fully grown adult for decades, and does not need her meat cut for her. The cutting of the meat only served to dry it out and make it cold faster.  I got two small potatoes cut in half , unpeeled asparagus and a very small filet of salmon cooked on a piece of burned cedar shingle. This had brown honey mustard squirted on top, yuck!!!! Dessert : supposed chocolate pot de creme Turned out to be a glass jar with what tasted like a gob of Hersey's canned hot fudge sauce, and I believe it was.  The biscotti was the only highlight of the meal. The menu is badly constructed. The hostess, chef, and pastry chef all need to be fired. This is supposedly one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh? That's laughable. This place is billed as modern European, but doesn't even have a clue.",

    "text": "It's been a year since our last visit and review. The Terrace Room is unchanged. It's beautifully decorated for Christmas. The menu, limited but perfectly adequate, is little different from last year's. We each had the grilled salmon, I indulged in the spicy seafood gumbo, and my date started with the wedge salad. The food was good, but not great, and is certainly not the reason you come here. Service was slow, as always, indicating that it's that way by design. The wine list is quite good and prices are extremely fair for such an upscale venue. To conclude, the Terrace Room is about the atmosphere - so get dressed up and come down and enjoy the classy throwback while it's still here.",

    "text": "This review is for the afternoon tea service.   The Terrace Room is located within the gorgeous Omni William Pitt hotel, intruding into the lobby. It is a wonderful spot - you really feel like you've stepped into a slower paced time, which is just perfect for tea. It's great for people watching too, since there is bound to be a wedding party taking their photos in the lobby.   However the $30 afternoon tea service didn't quite live up to expectations. Our server was absolutely delightful, but the other staff member who seated parties, was very unfriendly. Her perfume was also so strong that we could smell it from across the room, which detracted from the experience.   While it wasn't too expensive (in NYC, afternoon tea is upwards of $60-100 or more), I've had afternoon teas in the Northwest for around $30 and the quality just didn't match up. I was disappointed that that the quintessential cucumber sandwich didn't make it to the plate and the ham/cheese sandwich was just blah. The scones and macaron were pretty good but the other desserts were sub-par. I would have expected desserts on the level of Gaby et Jules for the price and the location. Overall, I had an okay time but I could have skipped it.",

    "text": "Something is definitely different in the kitchen this year--and definitely for the better!  This is our family's fourth year staying at the William Penn for our annual Penguin pilgrimage and we've had breakfast here previous years. The food was good before but honestly I would eat cardboard under that magnificent ceiling (the room really IS that spectacular).  This year though, we were all seriously impressed with the food itself. I ordered the Croque-Monsieur and WOW. It is huge, but more importantly, it is also EXCELLENT. I told the waiter that I gave some to my husband because I didn't want him to think I ate it ALL by myself and he joked that I shouldn't have told him that because I could have gotten a free T-shirt if I did. The atmosphere is a little too posh for that silliness but the waiter's dry humor made for a fun breakfast.  I actually had to debate not going to Pamela's the second morning (but we couldn't do that because it would be like we didn't go to Pittsburgh if we skipped Pamela's).   Anyway, some one REALLY knows what they are doing back there in the kitchen now. Two people in our group ordered benedicts--one traditional and one Baltimore style with crab. It's always a risky thing since you might wind up with the white part being runny, but these were PERFECT benedicts. The smoked salmon and avocado toast was also very good.   Kudos William Penn! We'll be back next year.",

Tea was good, I have English Breakfast and my wife had peppermint. She liked it a lot.   Some said it was like sitting in the main hall (public area), I dont think so, we were seated on the side, and it was not that bad. I also notice that the inside restaurant was open too, sure you can seat there if you asked.  My wife found it on Groupon. Great 2 hours dating time.",

It's a three course meal with your choice of cocktail for $27 I believe. We love it! I got White Russian as my cocktail, maybe they're normally just THAT good, but yum I'm a White Russian fan now. Anyway for appetizer I got the blueberry sausage empanada, and lawd lemme tell you, this is the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>. I did not think it'll go well together, but it def blew my mind leaving me wanting more in the end. The entree I honestly don't remember what I got, I just know there's bacon and asparagus. It was good but not as mind blowing as my appetizer. For dessert I got the berry lemon scone, it's delicious! Although I really want to try their chocolate taco, the waiter recommended the lemon berry scone so I trust him. In the future if I come get brunch here again, I definitely will order everything the same, except I'll probably try new entree and new dessert. All I'm saying is the blueberry empanada, go for it :p",

I arrived and everything of course is so immaculate. I imagine that if I was on the boat of the titanic, that's what the inside would look like. Very pristine, white, and full of glass and crystal.   I had a party of about 8. We sat down and immediately, the wait staff pours you water and takes your napkin and puts it in your lap. Feels very Buckingham palace! :)  Love the assorted breads that were brought to the table. I ordered the Brussel Sprouts for my app and French onion soup. Both good choices. The French onion soup has a top layer of cheese that I know I would have devoured more of if I wasn't trying to be so prim and proper.   Can't wait to go there again! Definitely worth the 5 stars!",
