    "text": "Thoroughly enjoyed our meal today celebrating Father's Day with my husband and son!  Started with the platter Taste of Huszar which we all shared--great assortment of cheeses, sausages, fruits and vegetables. A very good  balance of flavors and textures.  We all had different entrees-- Bakonyi Pork; Pork Chop stuffed with cheese and bacon and Chicken Paprikash. The portions were huge so we ended up taking home the delicious meals for lunch tomorrow.  This way we saved room for dessert and what a good move that was!  The fresh baked Hungarian desserts (which I can't spell!) were amazing! I highly recommend a visit for an awesome meal, and save room for dessert!  The hospitality was warm and welcoming.  A True gem in the Pittsburgh culinary scene!",

Everything is made in house by their Hungarian trained chef. The owner sat down with us and explained to us about the dishes we were eating and about what they are doing as a restaurant to serve authentic cuisine. This place offers a great experience with fantastic food. Whether you're a pittsburgh native or a visitor looking to see what awesome restaurants pittsburgh has to offer, you'll love this place.",

Little did I know there was wonderful surprise waiting in there, delicious Hungarian food and incredible service. I had the bacon and cheese stuffed pork chop along with the potato pancake. The pork chop was savory and flavorful while the potato pancake was light and delicious. Paired with a Hungarian pilsner and affordable pricing for both food and drink, I'm looking forward to being a regular for dinner at this hidden gem.",

    "text": "I wanted to try this place for it's interesting menu and the live string quartet and my friend, less interested in these finer aspects of an experience, just wanted beer and some screens to watch the basketball game and I was like YUSSSSSS.. HUSZAR FTW!! They scored on all counts - Great Croatian beer and two big TVs screening the basketball game so my friend was happy. AND for me, the absolutely enjoyable live band playing traditional and folk Hungarian tunes, the Hungarian wine that my waitress recommended as well as the crowd which despite mostly being regulars was so welcoming and friendly. Soon after we walked in and were taking in the sights and sounds, a Hungarian-Croatian couple struck up a conversation with us, welcoming us and asked us if we were going to eat. We must have looked doubtful because they quickly told us that the food is amazing and we shouldn't miss dessert! I'm glad I took her advice!! :) It's telling when customers welcome you, and tell you to come back again, that they are proud of their little neighborhood joint and it's story as if it were their own. The service was great - We missed last call for ordering dessert but our waitress very kindly accommodated us and we were able to eat one of their yummy Hungarian style crepes with apricot jam and rum. The food had plenty of vegetarian options for me. I shared the friend cheese appetizer with my friend and had the mushroom paprikas for my entree - A1! Like I said, not one aspect of my experience here was sub-optimal. I will be going back for sure and highly recommend this place, especially on a Thursday when the Gypsy Strings are playing. We went at around 9pm, so we found seating easily but I was told that an hour ago, the place was PACKED and we would have had to stand. You could make reservations though! And I'll pass on what I was told when I walked in - You don't wanna miss dessert! :)",

The food was delicious, the folks were friendly, but it was very chill - we snagged a booth and relaxed. My dining companion and I both had Uborkasalata (cucumber salad w/sour cream). Flavorful! I had the delicious Chicken Paprikas - creamy, comforting, with just enough paprika for a little kick. Dining companion had the Marhaporkolt (stewed beef) - it was restorative, after a very stressful week. But, oh my - the homemade dumplings! Reminded me of spaetzel. Delicious with both of our dishes, but I bet those little pasta pillows would be delightful with just butter and salt.   It is as of a corner Pittsburgh bar with great Hungarian food time traveled from the 1950ies to today. But better!",

    "text": "A dive bar with an ethnic menu? Good reviews? And unique Hungarian food? Hmmm.... sounds like a place to check out! And indeed, that's what we did when a friend came to town for the Marathon.  We made a reservation (was not really necessary) and used our GPS to find the place. The decor on the outside is not very promising, nor is the impression on first walking it to the place. This is the classic neighborhood bar. Somewhat dark inside; long bar on the right side of the room with some TVs showing sports about the bar; small tables along the right side; etc.  When we walked in there were three people seated on the bar stools and two tables were occupied along the left. A woman seated at the bar turned to look at us and started speaking --- turns out she was the owner or manager of the place! She took us to a table that was towards the back of the room - beyond the bar - gave us menus and told us our waitress would be along shortly, then she went back to her bar stool. Ummm....  Looking over the menu, we see that it really does feature Hungarian dishes. We started looking over them and tried to decipher some of the unfamiliar dish names and our waitress came over offering water and other drinks. We asked for the wine list and she quickly brought both. We asked for a few clarifications on the menu items and she really knew her stuff. We decided on an appetizer and continued deliberating what to eat.  A few minutes later we decided to order a soup, a second appetizer, a main dish, and two side dishes to share and were wondering about what wine to pair with it when she came back. We asked for help as we do not know Hungarian wines except for the sweet Tokajis (which were NOT going to work with this food!) and she admitted that she is not a wine drinker, but she took our order and had another server come by.  The second one, was able to help us a bit - her wine knowledge was also rather limited - but she eventually convinced us to try a dry cherry wine that she claimed was Hungarian. As it happened it really did work well with the food we ordered, even though it was not a Hungarian wine!  On to the food: We started with the fried dough appetizer - this tasted like a savory puffy doughnut and with the grated parmesan cheese on top; steaming hot; it was delicious. It was light enough that we did not feel like we overdid it on the first course! The soup was a good chicken soup with carrots, peas, and a version of Spaetzle - very tasty but not exceptional. The Chicken Palacinta was a light crepe filled with ground chicken and covered with a light tasting sauce of some kind. Not sure all the ingredients in the sauce, but the whole dish was light and flavorful. Chicken Paprikas had a pounded chicken breast that was a bit overcooked so that it was dried out, but the combination of the spaetzle that it was on with the sauce it was drenched in made up for that mistake. The whole combination was very tasty. The two side dishes that we got were also very good. The red cabbage was just sour enough to be enjoyable while the cucumber salad was sweet and vinegary and provided the perfect counterpoint to the creamy dishes.  When we stopped eating - with leftovers sitting in front of us! - our waitress came back and told us that they recently brought a Hungarian pastry chef from Hungary and that we should at least go and look at the desserts which were in a small refrigerator next to the bar. We complied. While trying to figure out what was what, the owner came over to us and introduced us to a young man sitting with her who was the new pastry chef. While he wore a Pittsburgh Penguins t-shirt, turns out his English is pretty poor so the owner translated between us. Needless to say, we had to try a few things! We ended up getting the following: Shortbread cookie with an apricot filling, covered in chocolate, with the restaurant name in white frosting - yummy! Layered cake with walnut layers held together with an apricot filing and topped with a chocolate ganache - yummy! Dobos Torte - yummy!  In other words, contrary to our initial impressions, the food was really good, the desserts were outstanding and we heartily recommend the place to all comers!",

I wouldn't order it again, but I'm glad I tried it. The Chicken Paprikas blew my mind and my belt buckle 2 sizes.

    "text": "I stopped by here a couple of Friday nights ago with my wife for dinner.  We found out about Huszar from an article in Pittsburgh Post-Gazette which my dad ripped out for me.  Having just been to Budapest this past summer my wife and were eager to eat some authentic Hungarian again.  The outside of Huszar is quite inconspicuous and I have been past it a number of times since it took over from The Recovery Room and never noticed it was there.  The inside isn't that impressive either with a bar on one side of the restaurant and some seating on the other with a little more towards the back.  Whenever we walked in we were surprised whenever we were asked whether we had reservations.  We did not and so they offered us a hightop table which we declined to sit at the bar.  We ended up sitting next to a lady who I think was the owner.  She had been to Budapest 44 times and so we both talked about our experiences.  For dinner on this evening my wife and I decided to start off by splitting the Rantott Sajt.  This was fried cheese accompanied by a Hungarian tartar sauce and some white rice.  The fried cheese in the dish was good as the outside was crispy and the inside nice and gooey.  While I originally thought that the rice was a weird addition to the dish I soon found out that it played well with the tartar sauce which had a interesting and somewhat sweet flavor.  Then for my entree I decided to go with the classic chicken paprikas while my wife went with the Putsza Steak.  My entree consisted of stewed chicken with sour cream paprika sauce over top of dumplings. The chicken in my dish had some good flavors with a nice little kick in the finish which I enjoyed.  The  dumplings (nokedli) were also really good and if you have never had them before they may remind you of very tiny gnocchi.  My wife's dish was a pork cutlet that had potato pancake breading on it.  I was impressed that the breading really tasted like potato pancakes and that it gave it some nice texture as well.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back to Huszar again in the future.  It certainly wasn't the healthiest of meals but it was a tasty and is one of the few places in Pittsburgh to get authentic Hungarian food.",

    "text": "Stopped here today as a friend really wanted to try the place. We were greeted right away, and sat at a small table across from the bar. I really like the menu with nice descriptions given along with the Hungarian names of the dishes. The waitress was very helpful with any questions about the food. I had the Goulash,   which is a soup with tender pieces of beef with potatoes and little dumplings like the German spatzle in a very flavorful broth. I also had the cucumber salad with sour cream. Both were very good. My companion had the chicken paprikas, and the cabbage salad which she found to be excellent. This was all very homey comfort food. The thing that was very outstanding were the deserts.We had ordered something called Kremes and a thing that looked like an eclair and split them between us to share. My and her favorite was the Kremes. It had a flaky top and bottom with a light custard filling. All the deserts look fabulous and I don't think you would go wrong with any pick.I believe the prices were very good as my soup and salad was almost $20. If I had gotten and entree instead of the soup it would have only been 5-10 dollars more. Parking on the other hand is a pain. There is a tiny lot that holds maybe 5 cars. Limited parking on the street around the corner which during the day is limited to 2 hours.",

    "text": "My first few experiences eating at this bar/restaurant were positive. The food is well prepared - tasty comfort food. The owners recently brought a chef to the US from Hungary, and he seems very sweet and is obviously talented. The desserts are exceptional. I have had a pleasant relationship with the owners.  I am sharing my experience a couple of days ago because it was alarming, and I think it is important for people to know what they could potentially be walking into.   My father and I ate dinner here a couple of days ago, three days after the Presidential Inauguration and two days after the Women's March on Washington. We were the only patrons in the bar, and we had a pleasant quiet dinner. As we were finishing and relaxing with another drink, the owner, Judy, began yelling about politics at a volume and with a frenzy that was immediately alarming. This went on for almost five minutes or more, where it was not possible to get a word in to tell her that I was not interested in discussing this, so I signaled to the girl behind the bar to give us our check, we cashed out, and we left.   Frankly, I'm not sure what she was trying to accomplish. We had not spoken to her for probably half an hour, we hadn't discussed anything political with her, and we were friendly and engaging when we came in.   I personally found her behavior to be incredibly alarming, offensive, and obviously completely unprofessional. Regardless of how I feel about her political perspective, her volume, topic, and unrelenting intensity were very unpleasant, and turned what may have been a pleasant evening into an awful experience.  Incidentally, I marched in the Women's March on Washington over the weekend for hours, and I did not experience any kind of interaction - during a massive protest - that was this hostile. I'm sorry, but this was really not ok.",

Food is good,  but not great.  Server was completely untrained with no knowledge of the menu.  It took 45 minutes from the time the first entree hit the table to the last,  with many mistakes and errors in between.  Our checks took equally long to fix.  Despite our continued patience we were not offered anything by the owner,  who after a while,  quit apologizing out of embarrassment.  Also would like to point out that this new business has been open for some time now with only 2 reviews.  Normally,  I'd expect more especially when I had heard such positive things...",

It just looks like any other bar from the outside, not a fantastic Hungarian restaurant with amazing food and pastries. I had the Chicken paprikas and split the cucumber salad with the BF; he had Gypsy pork loin. We got the cucumber salad with the sour cream and the sauce was so good li wanted to lick the plate. The chicken paprikas was equally as delish. Right across from our table was a big case of the prettiest parties, and needless to say I got about $20 worth. They also has a selection of Hungarian beers and wines, if that's your thing. This place is great for everyone, but for someone with a Hungarian background to meet the owner and hear her story...it really makes it special.",

I must say before I go further, that it is very important to make reservations on Thursdays night to have a seat, enjoy the performance, and food. The seating is very limited, as the place is very small. However, Iit is an absolutely fun time on Thursdays - I enjoyed listening to the Gypsy String and watching other customers join in singing.  Our waitress was wonderful and had gave excellent customer service. Now, the food! I had the Goulash and Hortobagyi Husos Palacsinta. The Goulash is usually quite familiar to us in the US. It is similar to a beef stew that was filled with much flavor, comfort, and love....so I definitely recommend that. The Palacsinta was good as well, however the chicken is pureed in a crepe so I was a bit shocked with the texture but it was very delicious. And I loaded it up with a lot of sour cream. If you ask for extra Sour Cream, your waiter will LOVE YOU!",

Lastly, we took dessert to go. All the desserts that were available were throughly explained to us. All were delicious, and tasted very European because they weren't super sweet. The service was very friendly and on point. I wish we had this restaurant in our area.",

    "text": "My daughter and I had never eaten Hungarian food before. We read the menu online and it sounded like things we would like. Of course we read the reviews here on Yelp to make sure it was a good place.  At first I was a bit put off by the lack of response to my message on Yelp and Facebook. I have an unlisted phone number and was unable to make a reservation by phone as they don't allow private number calls to go through.  We showed up early and were seated right away. I am glad we were earlier than the dinner rush. By the time we left the place was packed!   For apps we had the Langos which wasn't on the menu, and the Taste of Huszar platter. Both were delicious. If you come you must try the Langos!   The table next to us ordered the Hungarian Goulash and it looked and smelled soooo good, if I had a spoon I might have created an incident by tasting it.  With such a diverse menu and everything sounding so yummy we decided to order 3 entrees to split and take home some lunch for tomorrow. After much deliberation we narrowed down our choices to Puszta Steak, Bakonyi Pork and Chicken Paprikas. All 3 were wonderful. The potato pancake crust was crisp and the pork was tender. It was perfectly seasoned. I didn't care for the smashed potatoes. The texture was grainy and the flavor seemed a bit odd to me. It may simply be my inexperience with Hungarian food and it might be the cultural inadequacy of my palate. The nokedli dumplings that came with the other two dishes were perfect little bits of heaven. They were soft yet firm, and had a nice chew to them. They held the saucy goodness of the Chicken Paprikas well. The chicken was tender and had taken in the smokey flavor of the paprika. The slow simmered flavor was amazing and had that comforting sensation of someones grandmother's dinner table. The Bakony Pork was great as well with the sliced mushrooms in the gravy being the star of the dish for us.   Of course the two desserts I most wanted to try weren't available. The Kremes and Chocolate Torte sounded lovely. Instead I had the Retes, the apple  strudel was good. My daughter had the Palacsinta with Nutella and Cottage Cheese which she ate a little bite of each together and said it made a perfect flavor with both. I don't like Nutella...(I know everyone else in the world loves it don't hate me)I liked the cottage cheese one though. It reminded me of Ricotta crepes.  We were stuffed! Thanksgiving diner unbutton your pants and slip into a food coma on the couch stuffed. Our tastebuds were tingling with excitement through the entire meal. We took home 3 to go boxes with enough for two full meals, and a snack. All that for under $100.   Service was a bit slow. There was one server/greeter who seemed to be running herself far too hard. In spite of being the only one in the front of the house she didn't forget anything and kept up on our beverage refills. One other lady emerged from the kitchen periodically to buss a table or pick up dishes as they were emptied.   Overall I was highly satisfied with the entire experience and will definitely be back to try some of the other dishes.",

The food here is amazingly comforting and tasty, even in the doldrums of summer and the staff are incredibly personable and hilarious.  Huszar has ambiance for days and it's such a, relatively hidden, gem here in North Side that does not get enough love!",

The chicken paprikas dish was probably my favorite. They also had a tasty dessert. Service was friendly.  There is a small parking area that won't hold too many cars and is a bit of a pain to get out of. And they had an annoying show on the TV. But that is about all the negative I can say about it.  Definitely a place you should check out, especially if you've never had Hungarian food before.",

    "text": "Who knew Hungarian food would be so good?  I didn't and I am glad that I have decided to open myself up to new and exciting foods.  We were stuck in traffic in Pittsburgh and had obviously taken the wrong route to where we were going.  Usually this turns out to be one of those things where you get fed up and kind of just go home.  Luckily for us we ended up finding this place.  From the outside it kind of looks like a dive bar so usually we wouldn't have given it a second glance.  But waiting at a light because of construction gave us the chance to read their sidewalk sign and after some debate we decided to give it a try.  Just an FYI, parking in this area is a bit hard to find, so you may be in for a bit of a walk to get here.  Don't worry, it is worth it.  We showed up on a Wednesday evening and had no problem finding a seat, in fact we decided to sit at the bar.  We immediately struck up a conversation with the bartender and found that if we were to come later in the week or the weekend, it's best to call ahead and make a reservation because it will be packed.  After looking over the drink menu we both went for a Pilsner Urquell.  I was pleasantly surprised by this beer from the Czech Republic and loved how easy it went down.  We both decided on a appetizer, my better half went with the Red Cabbage Salad (Kaposztasalata) and I went with the Fried Cheese (Rantott Sajt).  His salad reminded me of a vinegar heavy Cole Slaw.  But I was too focused on the fried cheese.  I know people are raving about this, and I can understand why.  I will rave about it.  It's nothing more than fried breaded cheese.  But it was amazing fried breaded cheese.  This comes with white rice and Hungarian style Tartar sauce.  That sauce added a sweetness to the fried cheese and kind of made me want to learn how to make it so I could have it at home.  For the main course my better half went with the Chicken Paprikas.  I tasted this and liked it, but not enough to ditch my plate.  I had the Seasoned Butter & Cheese Stuffed Chicken Breast (Fuszeres Vajjal Toltott Csirkemell).  (If you noticed, I copied and pasted the names from the menu, there was no way I was going to remember how to spell any of that) If you are looking for a filling meal, this is the way to go.  That was one huge chicken breast that was filled with butter and cheese.  Then it was all breaded, fried up perfectly and then presented to you cut down the middle so you can see that cheese oozing out piping hot ready to be eaten.  The potatoes were basic.  But to me, basic potatoes are quite alright.  Fried up and salted is all you had to do.    This definitely was one filling meal that will have me coming back for more.  Especially as welcoming and chatty the staff were.  She was a delight to talk with and she gave us a little background of the place.  The chefs are from Hungary so you know you are about to have an authentic meal.",

The walls are covered with memorabilia from the Austro-Hungarian empire as well as pictures from more modern Hungary. The food is plentiful and very moderately priced. The majority of dishes have meat but there are plenty of appetizers and entrees for vegetarians. We had our entrees served with dumplings but one could substitute mashed potatoes. Service was quick. The owners were good about explaining the food options. I boxed up part of my entree because I wanted to try the traditional gundel palacsinta. I am generally not a big desert person but this one is a must try. The gundel palacsinta is a crepe filled with apricot jam and ground walnuts. It is covered with chocolate sauce.",

    "text": "Very authentic 100% homemade Hungarian, GREAT service and full bar. If that is what you are looking for then this is the place for you.  Decent portions and a nice amount of menu options. We ordered the Taste of Huszar which is an assortment of cheese, meat, bread, fruit and vegetables.  We also had Bakonyi Chicken with dumplings.  I have nothing bad to say about the food but honestly, it is nothing to write home about.  The desserts on the other hand are wonderful. My palate tends to like the more exotic and although this food was good, I found it bland and uneventful.  For me it was your standard, meat and stew sauce with a potato or dumplings.    They have a very small parking lot, maybe it fits 5 cars.  Street parking is a nightmare and is zoned, so here is a tip.  Right across the street from the restaurant is HOWARD street.  Park there on the right side.  Its a dead end and is not zoned.  You are welcome.",

    "text": "My husband grew up eating Hungarian food made by his Grandmother who hailed from Budapest so it's cuisine I have also embraced. We search for Hungarian restaurants everywhere we go and now Pittsburgh has one right on the corner of East Street & North Avenue on the Northside. Hungarian food is delicious comfort food with slow cooked meats, flavorful sauces, homemade dumplings or noodles and scrumptious desserts. This restaurant also has a fairly large vegetarian menu and a full bar with some craft beer selections on tap.   I ordered the pickled red cabbage slaw and my husband got the cucumber salad to start. Both were fantastic. My entree was Chicken Paprikas which is stewed chicken in a paprika based cream sauce over dumplings. There were equal parts white & dark meat chicken in the dish, so I ate everything but the dark & my husband finished that along with his Beef Porkolt in gravy over dumplings. Dessert was fresh from the oven Sour Cherry Strudel and a cottage cheese crepe Palacsinta as good as Grandma R. used to make!  We enjoyed chatting with Judy, the owner, and meeting her Hungarian chef who is here for 2 years on a work visa. Most importantly we really appreciated the food!",

    "text": "I'm certain most people have no idea what Hungarian food is. Sure, you've probably heard of  or even had \"goulash\".  But I assure you, that barely scratches the surface of this tasty, real comfort food cuisine. I consider myself a subject matter expert on Hungarian food. A dubious distinction you say? Ha. Taste the food at Huszar and then say that. I grew up with Hungarian food, my Hungarian grandmother taught me to make some dishes (along with a few curse words), and I've sought it out in my decades of travel domestically and internationally. I've eaten it all my life and even in Budapest. I can assure you I know legit Hungarian cuisine. This place has legit food. Full of flavor, comforting, appealing on every level, and a pure taste sensation.   I was able to talk at length with the owner, Judy. She brought the chef out to introduce him to us. She recruited him in Hungary last year and convinced him to come over. He is doing fabulous things in that kitchen. We started with some red cabbage and cucumber salad appetizers. Both incredible. On to the chicken paprikas and porkolt. Awesome. Finished with the real test - sour cherry strudel and cottage cheese palacsinta. They were perfect   We each had a Joe IPA draft (from Oregon) - haven't seen that beer anywhere around here. Delightful.   Sure it may not be the high end restaurant you may normally seek out. This is a bar with great food. Solid 4 plus stars. Next time you're thinking you'd like some ethnic food, pass on those Italian, Indian, middle eastern, Chinese thoughts. Go for comfort. Get to Huszar. You'll be glad you did.",

Done.    Little did we know this would turn out to be maybe even a little better than the dinner we had planned on.    We each had something different and there was not a bad thing on our table.  The waitress was insanely accommodating and helped us through the menu.  Our 2 year old was in love with the cheesy dumplings they made just for her.    Overall the food was delicious and authentic.  They have a full bar with imported features.  Service was fantastic and atmosphere was welcoming.  Can't go wrong.",

She remodelled the place and brought in a Hungarian chef. It's a quaint neighborhood bar with some restaurant seating. The food is authentic and delicious.   The service was excellent, my server was attentive and was able to make some great recommendations from the menu.  I was particularly delighted to find a number of vegetarian options, all very reasonably priced.  They have some cool craft beers on tap. I'm not sure why they don't have Hungarian beers, but I did try an unusual Croatian beer.  In summary, great Hungarian food in a welcoming, friendly corner bar.",
