I was hesitant to go in since it didn't look promising from the outside, probably because they have random objects stacked up on the storefront. But the inside is very clean with the kitchen set up in a bar style. Small, but decent amount of seating. The bar style seating is perfect for people eating alone. Quite a few options and friendly staff. All the different components of the ramen were packed in separate boxes. While I appreciate the effort, the amount of plastic made me feel guilty. The ramen itself didn't blow my mind and so the three stars. The broth wasn't as flavorful as some other ramen I had before.   I'll give it another try before giving up on this place. This place is however liked by quite a few people from that I could gather.",

As an additional plus, they package the broth and the noodles separately which is perfect for lunch on the go. My challenge in rating this place is that the noodles taste very much like boxed ramen, everything from consistency to overall flavor. However, the meat is one of the best things I have tasted in a soup ever and the portion size is relatively good. I started at three stars but if you're a boxed ramen fan then this really is a four star flavor, if you expect more from your noodles or want a little more direction in the purchasing experience (service is not particularly friendly one way or the other) then you might want a more amicable, mom's kitchen feel type spot but for those of you running through Oakland who want a quick bowl of soup that won't slosh around and spill on you on your way back to the office then there is certainly no harm in checking this place out",

The ramen was mediocre, same texture as instant noodles but the soup and meat was great. Also waited for like half an hour to pay... Would not recommend going during busy hours.",

Also tried the squid and shrimp but it wasn't very spicy and not as flavorful as the kimchi ramen, squid looked fake. Kinda expensive at 11 dollars but I get two meals out of it. The dumplings were small but tasty. Ordered take out and they packaged the liquid and veggies/meat/noodles separate which is nice. It's no noodlehead but it's right next door for hospital staff and students so very convenient. Only waited like 6 minutes for my take out.",

The broth of the veggie ramen was so bad that even after adding a ton of soy sauce, it still tasted horrible. It wasn't that cheap either. Shumai was unremarkable and sauce was bland and oily. Will never go back here. It's frustrating to get bad takeout too because I'm not going to get back in my car and take it back, it's just not worth my time and gas. If I was eating in the restaurant I would have sent it back immediately- I smelled the broth before I poured it in with the toppings and I knew something was wrong, it smelled awful and not at all like ramen should. I've had ramen all over Pittsburgh and NYC so I know what it's supposed to taste like and this was truly terrible and disappointing. Save your money!!! Do not go here, ever.",

I asked for a table for 2, the lady proceeded to tell me 5 minutes.. 5 minutes passed and I'm just waiting for her to tell me again another 5 minutes. 10 minutes passed and I asked. I didn't get my table till 15min later when there was clearly a table that just needed to be cleaned. Not sure why the waitress and another fellow waiter felt the need to tag team to clean the table together but when seated, I had to wait another 5 minutes to place an order and no water/tea in sight. Not to mention, she didnt sound happy taking my order at this point. I have a 30min lunch break and let's just say, I missed a session because of terrible service.  I was famished so I had no choice. The only highlight that gave this review 2 stars is the food. The ramen was superb, flavor was on point! I'm not sure why they hired these wait staff but I'm utterly dissatisfied. Not sure if I'd return for lunch again.",

Firstly, the person taking the order wasn't able to understand/answer any questions about the menu or get someone to answer, despite my patiently repeating myself several times. Finally, i ordered. The place was nice and clean and i got my food ready to go pretty fast. The gyozas were good, no issues there. I was very excited for the ramen and once i opened the ramen bowl, it looked and smelled delicious. But it needed the ramen broth to complete the dish. Now, i opened the broth container and it just wasn't right. I am not new to ramen flavors. The broth smelled really earthy... which isn't unusual but when i tasted a little, it was pretty bad. It had no flavor... the color was brown and unappealing, the texture was like a latte..... to clarify, it wasn't like old/gone bad...it was just a bad tasting recipe. Heating and mixing with noodles didn't help. I could barely eat less than half and threw the rest. I hope other things on the menu are better. For the price, i wouldn't mind trying something else. But NEVER trying this dish again... EVER!",

The menu has a nice variety of different types of Japanese style ramen, as well as some appetizers like takoyaki.

Unfortunately they don't have a tonkotsu ramen which is my favorite, and so far I haven't been able to find it in Pittsburgh.

    "text": "After literally several years in development, this place is finally open! And not even as what it was originally advertised to be, which was Lanzhou noodles. This restaurant is now a solid Japanese ramen restaurant, which miscellaneous offerings of donburi, yakisoba, and apps. Somewhat interesting that it finally opens now, when ramen places are seemingly popping up all over Pittsburgh. From the price point and feel of the restaurant though, it seems more accurate to group it with the older places like Ramen Bar and Love Ramen (formerly Love Yogurt). The ramen bowls are priced at $10/11 and the ambience is quite casual, fitting in with most of the other Oakland restaurants nearby. For comparison, others like Ki Ramen or Yuzu Kitchen are more formal settings with more extensive menus and ramen bowls costing up to 50% more.  The ramen selections here encompass the usual shio, shoyu, and miso varieties, where each item has different combinations of ingredients. They also have curry ramens as well as tan tan, kimchi, and seafood ones. When we came in it was late at night and no other customers were here (perhaps also because they just recently opened), so our ramens came out soon after ordering. It looked quite authentic--it contained all the ingredients promised on the menu, and the size was large enough to be quite filling. The broth was immediately impressive--very savory and decently thick, giving you a warm feeling in your whole body. The noodles were cooked just right and not too firm nor too soft. The chashu was extremely tender, with maybe just a bit more fat than I would've liked, but it was not a dealbreaker in any way. The runny egg was also cooked to perfection with the right consistency. In all these factors, this ramen solidly beats out Love Ramen and Ramen Bar, and is at the same time cheaper than some of the other places that I mentioned. The other ingredients in my bowl were the standard accompaniments and made the bowl delightful to finish.  This is a great addition to Oakland, and I definitely look forward to coming back and trying more of their ramens and maybe non-noodle dishes as well.",

Pretty average for ramen places in Pittsburgh but an exceptional addition for the void in the university area.   FYI: lunch is always a shit show, get here early.",

Trust me and try it, it could makes them better to perfect!",

The curry sauce is thick and spicy, and the chicken is tender and crisp.",

The restaurant is a bit small where there are only tables of 4 and we ended up sitting at the bar table.  I love ramen but this place is a bit disappointing. There are many choices on the menu while most of them look like the same. The Shio soup and Curry soup is just fair to me.  Noodle is too hard.  The sprouts are cold.  Pork is a bit fatty. 3 stars are more than enough for the food. The only pro in this place is their price. They took 10% off the bill if you pay cash. Noodle is 10$ each ($9 after discount) which is much cheaper than ny.  So I add 1 star for the their pricing. I would not suggest my friends to come for their noodles and I may not visit this store again when I pay my next visit to Pittsburgh.",

The seafood in the bowl included shrimp and squid. I waited approximately 10 minutes for my to-go order which wasn't bad at all. I haven't been back since, but I feel like I need to try ramen at other places before making a final decision. Truth be told, Oakland needed a restaurant like this.",

    "text": "Yes, No and OK.  Nice to have a small soup noodle house in the area. There is nothing better than a big hot soup with noodle on a cold winter day.  Yes, there is one in Lawrenceville, one in Squirrel Hill, but not Pitt campus. So I am glad this finally opened.   Inside is small. 4 tables for 4 and a row of bar tables (seats 8?).  Each table/bar-seats have access to a power outlet, so that's a plus.  We went for dinner and was served by a waitress. At first, I thought it was a serve-yourself diner by the placement of the cashier. Maybe that was for take-outs or lunch, i dont know.   Foodwise, we had Takoyaki (octopus balls), Spicy Akamaru Ramen and Seafood Ramen. Most noodles are about $10 each, which is reasonable.   Takoyaki (octopus balls) is $6 for 4.  I like the size of the appetizers, just a bite or two without filling you up. I wished the shell of octopus balls were harder. It was not undercooked, but it was on the softer side.   Spicy Akamaru Ramen was a pork noodle with shio soup. I actually like this one a lot.  The two spicy soups were similar but this one with pork is better. It has more depth.  The only downside is that the pork was slightly too fat.    Spicy seafood Ramen was the low.  I agreed that the seafood was under-seasoned.  It felt like frozen seafood (which they are) straight out from the freezer. Prefer the pork ramen much more.  Overall, I will give it another try for their non-spicy shoyu soup.  It is a convenient soup noodle house. Like the location, though there are better Japanese food around. . Street parking is easy after 6pm.",

I opted for the latter and ordered it spicy.   The broth lacked complexity and was overly salty with a touch of sesame oil and a little heat. The noodle to broth ratio was also off- too many noodles, not enough broth.  On the bright side, everything seemed pretty fresh, and the variety of veggies included in the dish was impressive. Woohoo, bamboo shoots.  Glad I tried it, but I won't return. Try Umami or Ki Ramen for a better bowl of noodles, with a more complex flavor. 3 stars because it wasn't the worst ramen that I've had in Pittsburgh.",

The first time I got the Gomoku ramen because I wanted the bokchoy in the broth, but it wasn't worthwhile since there was only one half piece. The second time I got the shoyu ramen and man was that a filling meal.  The amount of noodles they gave was sufficient to fill even my guy friends, although I have to say I took my leftovers home and enjoyed them later. The charisu was so soft and tender and very flavorful. The egg was sweet and soft in the center. Honestly my favorite part! On a cold winter evening, the soup warmed me right up. And charisu isn't the only meat that's good! The pan fried chicken was also very tender and delicious, didn't taste try and tough  and definitely better than any breaded chicken I've had. It wasn't white meat, maybe dark meat? In any case, the staff really knows how to make their ramen. We got takoyaki in addition to the ramen. It came with the moving fish flakes and packed with sauces on top and flavor within. Soft and chewy, a little spicy from the mayo I assume, and sweet from the other sauce! It wasn't my favorite because I personally am not a fan of octopus, but I would recommend it to anyone who is!   I would definitely come back. You have my vote!",

About the time we finished a lot of people were waiting for tables and we felt a bit rushed to get out, but somehow it didn't bother us. We had a good time.",

We came yesterday for lunch right before noon - definitely get here a bit earlier if you can, otherwise you'll be waiting for seats for quite some time since the restaurant is very small.   I ordered the Gomoku ramen, which came with straight noodles instead of wavy. The food came out very quickly. I was impressed with the ramen. To be honest, I was not expecting much since my ramen experiences in Pittsburgh have generally been bad, but I thought their broth had a nice, rich flavor and their noodles were cooked perfectly too. The egg had a bit of sweetness to it which I enjoyed, and their chashu, though on the fatty side, was very tender and melt-in-your-mouth. Besides the egg and the chashu, the rest of the toppings were nothing to rave about. Although it wasn't the best ramen I've had, I think it's one of the best ramen choices in the city. Prices are fair for the amount of food that you get too.   We did feel a bit rushed by the waitress to pay our check, but I think it was overall understandable since they were so busy and had such a long wait. I'm glad this place is in Oakland now and I'll definitely be back!",

We ordered Shio ramen, Katsu curry ramen, shoyo ramen and Tan Tan ramen. I got the shio ramen, which came with different noodles than others. The noodles were a little hard, and I was disappointed. My husband, who ordered the curry ramen, gave me some of his noodles and they were a lot better. So I asked the waiter if I can get a new bowl because to me the ramen seemed not fully cooked. The waiter was nice and gave me another bowl of ramen. Good service. To be honest, the broth is definitely lacking some richness and depth compared to the newly opened ramen place in downtown called Yuzu kitchen. But the price is lower so I guess you get what you pay for.  I believe the ramen broth is the soul of a ramen bowl, so this place is just average.",

I came here on a cold day with friends to get some delicious ramen. I was just a little late so my friends ordered my food for me. But the waiter insisted they don't want to serve them food until I arrive so the food won't get cold. It's interesting.. anyway, the food was good and most ramen soup on the menu are range I think from $10-11. I got miso ramen soup. I think it's good, but I'm not excited about it. I'll give it another try in the future, maybe other noodle soup will be better. My boyfriend got chicken katsu and I tried it it's phenomenal! I'm definitely just happy pittsburgh has another ramen place :)",

It was flavorful and just spicy enough to make me tear up a little. It was, however, a little salty (1 star off). The umami was there, but it was dominated by the salt content. The tender charsiu and sweet seasoned egg were the highlights of the dish! The service was great: fast and accommodating. I ended up paying about $16 (tip included), so I would say this place is on a pricier side if you're more on a budget, but not unusual for a ramen bar. The portion was fair, but could be a bit bigger for its location. Overall, it's a solid place for ramen and I cannot wait to go back to try more items on their menu.",

The charsiu has a great balance of fat a d meat and you get 3 of them on top.  The other toppings include bamboo shoots, corn, seafood cake, soft boiled egg, etc. based on the bowl you choose.  There is even a curry broth version you can eat with a super crispy chicken katsu that is quite delicious.    The menu also offers decent appetizers and also choices for one of the best fried rice bowls I ever had here.  The yakisoba noodle choices hit the mark if you want dry noodles!

I work in Oakland and walking past this place for the past few years I have seen the banner go up, then the steps put in, then the ramp, and then the inside renovated. Each time a new thing that happened my co-workers all rejoiced. We could not wait for this place to open. When it did, I sent a text and no one believed me, I had to take a picture with the open sign for everyone to get on board and come out.   So yesterday I packed my lunch and then promptly forgot it in the fridge. I thought it was about time to come here and try it out. I was also feeling a little bit under the weather and I thought soup would really hit the spot. Yum. So I walked over and stared at the menu before deciding on the Miso Ramen.   The staff was really attentive and the place was packed, that seemed like a really good thing to me. I got the Ramen to go and let me tell you, the service was super fast. I was surprised that I got it so quickly. Something that I really appreciated, and only saw when I got into work with my to-go bag was that they put the broth in a different container than the noodles. That way nothing was mushy. Yum.   The Miso Ramen came with charisu, fish cake, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, egg, scallion, and pork bone. I was honestly super surprised at how big the portion of this soup was. When I got to the office I could not believe it! The soup was really good. The broth was flavorful and amazing. And the noodles weren't mushy at all. The noodles were also packaged Ramen noodles, or at least they tasted like them. So if you were looking for other types of noodles I do not think that they had other options. I liked the Ramen Ramen-ness of the dish and having these noodles were awesome. Oh and that egg, done to perfection. Yum! I was full and warm. I would pick this again in a second. This was a really good bowl of Ramen. I think that in the Oakland area one of the best places that I have tried in a long time.    The rest of the menu also looked really good so I cannot wait to come back and try more. Just know if you do the portions are big so be prepared.",

    "text": "I was recently told to try the ramen at Zen. I have been on a ramen kick for the winter and love nothing more than a spicy bowl of noodles to keep the seasonal depression at bay. I ordered the tan tan ramen and gyoza through Uber Eats. I was not a big fan of the gyoza. The dumplings themselves didn't have much meat and the sauce was too sweet for my taste. The ramen was packaged nicely. Unfortunately, I was not very impressed. The pork was spicy but very oily. The bone broth was delicious but there wasn't much else to comment on. There was a tiny piece of bok choy  and a 1/2 of an marinated egg. Perhaps I made a poor ordering decision? I guess I will have to give it another go just to be sure. Decent ramen is better than no ramen at all!",

    "text": "** Best ramen place I have had in Pittsburgh. Affordable and decent portions along with a wide variety of options.   Zen is a ten. Hold up... looks like I may have found myself a new ramen spot in Pittsburgh. I know I just posted in my last review that I do not believe there is good ramen in Pittsburgh... but Zen proved me wrong. Very reasonable prices (around $10 or low teens), a ton of different options on the menu, and decent sized portions. On top of all that, it's on the edge of Oakland so accessible to college students.  When I first walked in, the savory aroma of the broth filled the restaurant, which gave this place a promising start. I ordered the spicy seafood ramen, which left me satisfied (apparently I am quite hard to please). It came with a variety of shrimp, fish, and fish cakes, and of course vegetables and noodles. Only thing that was missing was an egg, but that can be an add on for an extra fee.   Broth was very flavorful as is necessary in ramen. The spiciness level was perfect - enough to stimulate your taste buds but not too much to the point where its painful. The noodle texture was on point and chewy but not too hard. The variety of seafood just topped off the bowl. I particularly thought the fish pieces was a hit, as it added a nice szechuan spicy fish remix.   The only downside is that there is limited seating (around three or four tables for four, and a bar table for maybe 8-10), so don't come with a group bigger than four. Likely to have a wait if all the tables of four are filled.",

The broth was rich and flavorful and the chashu was perfectly cooked (my 3 slices were so tender they barely stood up to the chopstick).   The noodles were definitely not fresh, but that would have been asking for a bit too much for a small shop in Pittsburgh. Still, Zen's is the best ramen in this city.   They also give you a 10% discount if you pay in cash.",

It seemed like the spicy broth was just dumped with sriracha or a hot sauce. It was just too concentrated. Overall, a decent place to grab some ramen if you are craving it. However, I probably will not be back.",

The service was quick and friendly, the menu was concise with all the classic favorites (vegetarian, pork, beef, chicken, and seafood options)  I got the spicy seafood, and my better half got something with pork in it and broth on the side.   Loved mine, excellent broth and noodles as perfect texture. The seafood bits themselves were a little under seasoned, but the broth more than made up for it. The pork bowl was also well received, had excellent seasoning. Wasn't sure if we were supposed to pour the broth into the noodle bowl or just take them separately, but it was still delicious.   Will definitely return whenever in the area  Pictures attached",

Oakland prices are generally pretty low, but this is a huge bowl of noodles with meat and veggies and everything for $10, which is unheard of where I'm from. The ramen was really tasty -- I especially enjoyed the egg. I also ordered takoyaki, which came covered in flavorful sauce. The bonito flake that came on top of the takoyaki was a bit much, but I was able to get most of it off without trouble.   Service is really fast, making this a great place to come even during busy times in the year. If you're a student looking for a bit of a nicer meal that doesn't require getting on a bus or breaking the bank, Zen's Noodle House is a great place to go.",

Everything seemed like it was made before, because the only thing even remotely \"piping hot, or just hot\" was the noodles and broth. The ramen comes with one tiny fish cake (cold), 3 pieces of chasu (delicious but lukewarm), and literally 2 pieces of menma. It's good enough to eat but there's clearly not enough manpower or ideas to run a well-made ramen restaurant that's unique. The broth is miso and it's clearly just the paste.. no additional effort and it still sells at $10/bowl.  Ordered the katsu for appetizer - size is fine, but it was lukewarm also and the fried skin kept falling off.  The place is also TINY (to be fair, they get people in and out quickly), but don't expect to come with large groups. The biggest table is for a table of 4.   Definitely needs improvement, but people will continue to come since it's the only ramen joint in the area.",

    "text": "Stopped by here with a group of friends for dinner tonight. After seeing this place under construction for so long, I wanted to see what had finally come in.  We had a group of five and the sitting area for the restaurant is pretty freaking tiny. They have a bar area for like 10 people and then about 4 or 5 tables. So we had to wait for a little bit for a table, but it also took forever for the servers to pay us any notice despite waiting inside for 10 minutes. And then after that, another 20-30 minutes for a table. The service here is pretty bad, not going to lie. We were able to order right away because we were waiting so long for a table, but then we ordered 5 waters and the waitress brought us 2 and then never gave us the others until we had to ask someone else. All the servers seemed super polite, but not very attentive.  The food was fine. It's nothing special, honestly. Our table had pretty much each ordered different types of ramen and it was just OK. I personally ordered the chicken katsu curry ramen and the chicken katsu was super good, but the ramen itself was just all right. However, the takoyaki and the gyoza were SUPER DELICIOUS. The takoyaki seemed fresh and was piping hot when it came to us and it was really flavorful and the presentation was nice too. But the food came out pretty fast once we were seated, so that was a plus.  Prices are pretty steep for the quantity and quality of the food, in my opinion.  I'd definitely come back here for the takoyaki and gyoza alone, but would probably skip on the ramen next time.",

I don't know if that particular waitress is new or something, but she basically yelled at me for knowing what to order (it was my first time and I was asking for recommendation). She then went ahead and took my soup away when there are still about half of it left without asking me, and when I literally had to cal after her for her to bring it back to me. She then proceed to once again take both of our cups of water while we were still sitting there and drinking from them, without asking us. Service is so bad i don't even know what to say.",

Living in Pittsburgh, it can be tough finding food like this. It's really close to what you would find in California (where I'm from) or Hawaii (stationed there for a few years). They have other menu items that look great like the teriyaki chicken or steak and the udon noodle bowls.  My only minor complaint would be to have some options or extras. Like giving the option for how spicy the curry is or maybe cheese to go on top of your food.  Either way, visit this place! It's really good.",

    "text": "TLDR; the worst service I've ever experienced at a restaurant.  I wasn't really going to try this noodle place because I don't think I'm that big of a fan of japanese ramen. BUT I came twice and here it is:  First visit: I ordered the chicken katsu curry bowl. The chicken katsu was good, but there wasn't enough curry for the amount of rice given and the piece of bokchoy that was on the side was not fresh at all. I came with a friend to catch up and what not, so we were having conversations and I guess the waiter kept thinking we were done eating/talking for some reason because he dropped off the check and continuously kept coming back and opening the check to see if our cards were in there. Obviously, our cards would not be in there if we weren't done eating and ready to leave... But he came three or four times and I was getting fed up with it. I placed my elbow on the check so that he would know that the check isn't ready. But he still came to check it. We still had food in front of us and were still in the middle of conversations but he would still interrupt our time. I really have never had a worse dining experience than here.   Second visit: I tried a japanese ramen this time because that's what they're known for so why not. I ordered the shoyu ramen. I just don't think I'm a fan of the flavor of japanese ramen. So I can't critique on what the ramen comes with and how it's supposed to taste, but I have to say that the ramen was pretty salty... And my two friends who ordered ramens as well said the same thing. As for the service, the waiter seemed like he was trying to get us out early. When it wasn't even that busy during the time we were there.   I personally am not willing to come back.",

    "text": "I stopped by here a couple of Friday nights ago with my wife for dinner.  Whenever we arrived at Zens Noodle house shortly before 8 PM there was only one other customer in the restaurant who was just finishing up.  So for almost the entirety of our dinner we had the place to ourselves which didn't bother us at all since it was cold outside and PITT was on winter break. The inside consists of a dining room on one half of the restaurant with the cash register and kitchen (clear glass so you can see into it) on the other.  The walls are made of black tiles with a cool sheen to them and have a light gray grout between them that makes it feel less dark.  For dinner on this evening my wife and i decided to split the octopus balls for an appetizer and then I went with the hot and spicy seafood ramen for my entree.  Our octopus balls came out first and looked great having been fried to a nice golden brown with some sauce and bonoto flakes over the top.  I really enjoyed the flavor of them as well, especially with the bonito flakes. The only thing that I didn't like about them was that some of the bigger pieces of octopus inside of the balls were pretty chewy.  Still, it was a delicious start to the meal.  Almost immediately after we finished the octopus balls our ramen was served to us.  Much like the octopus balls, they looked good whenever they were first brought to the table.  The hot and spicy seafood ramen consisted of a spicy shoyu broth with shrimp, squid, fish and mixed vegetables.  Out of the seafood I liked the shrimp and fish quite a bit but found the squid rings to be rubbery.  The real star of the dish though was the broth which was absolutely delicious.  It was complex and had a nice slow heat to it which kept on building up in intensity the more that you ate.  That meant that by the end of the meal I was coughing a bit from the spice level even if I didn't find it to be too spicy.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Both my wife and I really enjoyed our meals here and thought it was the perfect meal for a cold night.",

I didn't actually see any vegetarian options on the menu as most ramen contained pork or chicken. There was also a seafood ramen which I'd like to try next time. My husband loved his Shoyu ramen!   Would definitely come back if I'm in the area but would have enjoyed it more with more options for someone with food restrictions.",

If you come here expecting quality service and a long, leisure meal, this is not the place for you. This shop is small so the staff tries to maintain a quick turnover rate that you can't really blame them for.

The Miso Ramen is one of their more simple noodle bowls. I love the rich broth and as someone obsessed with eggs, theirs is delicious. As for the Chicken Katsu, they place the meat separately on a dish. It had just the right amount of crispiness.   * Price vs. Worth: It's hard not to compare restaurants but I would have given this place a 5/5 if the price was a little bit lower. I have been to other amazing noodle restaurants in Pittsburgh and their prices were lower. Even so, Zen's noodles bowls are around $10 which is a pretty good price in general. They give a good amount of noodles and it is definitely worth the price. That's why I've been here several times!  Will I come here again? - Of course!",

Reason I didnt give it four stars is because I hoped for a better broth flavor and richer taste on top of better noodles.

The service here was great; our waiter was friendly and attentive. Space was clean, which many Asian restaurants aren't. Another thing I really appreciated was the condiments at each table for your soup, which included spicy red pepper and fried minced garlic. While I thought the ramen was pretty good, I really enjoyed our appetizers: takoyaki and pork buns. They were the perfect size for sharing.

The vegetables with the ramen were fresh and pleasantly bright!  I came here with a friend who is a regular customer.

There was a generous serving of octopus, and the sauces weren't too overpowering that many street vendors tend to do. The ramen, however, I thought wasn't stellar. The soup is really bland, and the noodles are just so-so. The flavors definitely don't give hints of authenticity or anything exciting, which was a bummer, but at least it was agreeable.
