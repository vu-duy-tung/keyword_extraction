There's counter seating that gives it a fun vibe as well as plenty of tables and comfy chairs. Hubs enjoyed the Borana brew they were featuring and I had a tasty chai tea latte, kindly delivered to our table by the gentleman behind the counter. (Not something you'd get at Starbucks!) the biscotti were delish too. This seems like a great place to meet up with a friend, get some work done (free wifi) or to have some type of gathering. Wish we lived closer!",

When I got there, 2 platters were put together with homemade cream cheese. And the owner's husband carried it to my car. Great service! I'm looking forward to trying them for lunch in the near future",

I would absolutely have spent every afternoon here doing my chem homework.  The space is open and airy, and there are lots of tables and comfy chairs to sit and read or write.  They have free wi-fi (they'll give you the password at the counter), although I don't think there were a ton of outlets for laptop plugs.  I had a coffee and a sticky-sweet blueberry muffin.  There were probably about 8 billion calories in that heavenly muffin, but it was delicious, and I like to think that it gave me enough creative energy to work on my book that it was worth it :)  They do have a menu of *real* food, not just baked goods, so I think I will try some of that the next time I go in.  The only thing I'd say as a heads-up is that they have a few large coolers that are a bit loud, so I would recommend bringing your iPod along.  All in all though, I really loved the place, and when I am in the North Hills again looking for coffee, I will definitely keep this spot in mind!",

    "text": "This place is absolutely adorable! It's right up the street from my parents house. Since they opened up last October I make sure to go every time I'm in Pittsburgh.   They refinished this old building so nicely. It's so big inside but they've managed to make it incredibly cozy with all kinds of comfy couches, chairs, and lounge areas. It comes complete with all kinds of historical Ben Avon and Pittsburgh artifacts, including a lot of stuff from the Ben Avon fire department.   It's about time Ben Avon got a place like this, I really wish there were more people inside every day. But there are always at least 4 or 5 people hanging out taking advantage of the free Wi-Fi they offer!   The food I've tried has been good. The chili is BOMB but be careful it's pretty spicy! I also tried the buffalo chicken wrap and enjoyed that. The rice crispy treats are awesome. I don't like coffee so I haven't tried it..but my friend said it wasn't that good. But they have a very wide selection of teas, smoothies, and other coffee drinks.   Everyone that works here is extremely friendly, and if you live in Ben Avon you'll probably know who they are.   There's plenty of books and magazines around if you just want to hang out and read for a while. And a lot of artwork from local artists to look at too! I've also seen that they've brought in musicians and had a book reading there as well.  Seriously, check this gem out! Keep this place running, it's too good for the neighborhood to lose!",

We ordered one plain and one Parmesan.  The Parmesan bagel was moldy. Gross!!!!

We were debating about whether or not to make Americano's or drip coffee whenever I remembered a Groupon for a local coffee shop.  So after purchasing the Groupon we headed over there.  The inside of this place is quite spacious and has a lot of nice seating options from couches to an old diner type counter to a bar by the windows and even more.  Suffice it to say that my wife and I both loved the interior.  The barrister's here were also quite friendly and helpful.  For my breakfast I went with the key lime scone and an Americano while my wife went with an Americano and a nutella peanut butter muffin.  I started off with my scone which was quite large and hard on the outside while soft on the inside.  It was quite enjoyable although I am not so sure that I got any of the key lime taste.  After finishing my scone I tried my coffee and I have to admit that it was pretty bitter.  Thinking that it may have to do with the scone I just ate, I tried to cleanse my palate before trying it again.  Nope, still super bitter.  I am not sure if it was the coffee itself or whether the espresso had been over-extracted.  My wife thought the same so I am hoping it was just a bad batch of coffee.  She did enjoy her muffin though.  The bottom line for both me and my wife is that we would stop by here again in the future.  We both loved the space (5 stars) and service (5 stars) so would like to give the coffee (2 1/2 stars) another chance.",

They're basic paninis made with thick slices of lunch meat and cheese, but the bread has a nice crunch on it and the cheese is perfectly melt-y.  They also are served with a side of carrots.  It's a nice change from chips and I feel far superior and healthy after a handful of carrots.  I have also tried the cream of potato soup.  It was a little less creamy than I was expecting and I was hoping for more chunks of bacon and potato but the taste was lovely and it was just perfect on a cold winter day.

Husband and I found this place on a Saturday morning; it's spacious and modern inside, and pleasantly quiet... And the coffee was great! Espresso (Americano) was creamy and flavorful, and the smoky, spicy Smokestack signature latte is out of this world! The richness of the coffee is really allowed to come through.

    "text": "This was my first visit to Ben Avon (and first drive down Ohio River Blvd for that matter).  The location was lovely, but I admit that I passed the place up on my first go around, but I went around the block (which took longer than I intended) and made it there just fine.    I can see the appeal, the cafe seating area is huge and has multiple sections.  I didn't linger because it was within a half hour of their closing time, but probably wouldn't have anyway because it was pretty warm in there (maybe the air conditioning was broken?).  I got an iced latte mostly because I didn't see a menu anywhere.  After I ordered I saw one  on a clip board at the register...I'm thinking maybe they change their menu up a lot?  I didn't really get more than a glance at it and also saw menus floating around for tea and sandwiches.  I'm the type of customer that likes to have their order ready before they greet the person at the register, so I can't say I'm a fan of this practice.  As for the latte, the espresso was on the lighter side, nothing really remarkable there.  I think the major selling points are the cute out of the way location and the larger cafe space.",

I often stop for a coffee and steel cut oats with cranberries and brown sugar or almonds. One of the best day starters. It's a coffee house where you can have conversations with strangers.

For drinks, they have your basic expresso and typicals that you'd find at your local coffee shop, and they also have some mixed variations on coffee-based drinks, which I personally found to be quite good. They also have wraps, bakery pastries, and the such. It's nice to know that they do have specials and that the Wifi here is free, making productivity possible at this joint. Reasonable prices, good coffee, free Wifi = a great coffee joint to either meet up with another or just get some work done!",

The coffee is inconsistent and tends to be watery or burnt. The pastries are... Just okay. Sometimes I see the same pastries sit in the case for 2-3 days.  I go here for convenience and I recognize that they exclusively employ girls from the local high school, which helps them get a solid job reference and experience in a good industry, which I think is a very respectable thing to do.   Id like to see better, more consistent brewing and decent pastries that are fresh every day. I'd like to see the baristas receiving training from the coffee roasters that supply their beans.  I'm comparing this to my experience at places around town like Commonplace Coffee, Constellation, Espresso a Mano, La Prima Espresso Company, Big Dog Coffee, etc..",

It was a mocha latte but with a hint of chili powder and I have a weakness for spicy chocolate!

    "text": "This review is for the Coraopolis location.    I loved my little trip out to the Coraopolis Anchor & Anvil.  I was looking for somewhere to spend a little time between town and the airport and spent about an hour there right before closing on a Sunday.  It was oh so very quiet there, not like the more urban coffee shops with competitive seating.  There was an entire 3-seater couch and 2 easy chairs up for grabs.  There were a couple other people in the shop.  The barista was really friendly and interacted with super-shy me, which takes some doing.  I had read the menu in advance and had my heart set on one of their signature drinks, The Parking Chair.  I read the menu again anyway, and decided to order it, even after finding out that it is pre-mixed and thus cannot be made decaf.  They promised it would taste like melted espresso ice cream, and live up to that it did!  I don't 100% know what they put in it, but they say they use real ingredients, and it tasted that way.  This is not something to get on a regular basis as it was quite sweet, but it was a nice treat.  I liked the open and airy space, the minimalist/industrial vibe, the peace and quiet.  I liked that I had somewhere cozy to relax.  I took over an easy chair and noticed they had a couple of issues of a magazine for coffee and tea professionals called The Cup.  I didn't get anything done I'd planned to do because I read this magazine cover to cover--it was a great & inspiring read.  I'm looking forward to trying more of their signature drinks, either in Ben Avon (where is Ben Avon anyway?) or in Coraopolis, probably on the way to or from the airport.  PS: Coraopolis has a bit of a downtown so it's a good place to take a walk, too, if you make this coffee shop a destination.",
