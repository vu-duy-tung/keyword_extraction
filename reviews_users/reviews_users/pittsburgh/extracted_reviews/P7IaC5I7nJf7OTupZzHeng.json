    "text": "I made my last visit to the Sewickley Hotel last Saturday after giving them another chance from previous bad experiences.  I was with 2 friends and my friends 85 year old mother as we took a break from the Harvest Festival.  I'm not sure which was worse: the service or the quality of the food.  As a Dietitian, I questioned the safety of what was brought to our table. Getting seated and placing our order for drinks and food was no problem, but after this things went down hill very fast. The young lady who brought our food was not our waiter, and she announced as she put our food down, \"I am not your waiter and if you need anything else, you'll have to get it from him.!\" I   found this very rude and surprisingly hostile.  I had the fish taco special which was to come with chipotle mayo and a side of what one would assume to be tortilla chips.  My friends each ordered club sandwiches.  The fish taco was nothing to write home about as the fish was very bland and the mayo was missing as were my chips.  Salsa was provided, however. When I asked about them,  I was brought a small bowl of potato chips.   As my friends bit into their sandwiches they discovered the bacon was raw, not crispy and brown as cooked bacon should be, but pink, fatty looking, and chewy.  \"Disgusting!\"  When our waiter was finally located, he became very argumentative and was hardly apologetic.  We asked to see the manager and was told there was not one on the premises, just an executive chef.  He came to our table and was very nice, apologized, and offered us a free dessert.  At that point we just wanted to leave.  When my friends sister again complained about the service, our waiter came back and started to loudly argue with her, which is not good form, manners, etc. She was so offended she left the building.   Finally, the bar manager came over and apologized and told us not to worry about our bills.   I was so turned off by the experience, I just wanted to go home.  It is getting harder and harder to find a decent place to eat in \"charming Sewickley\".  Poor service is rampant in many of the eating establishments.  Maybe more managers of eateries should provide in depth basic etiquette training to new hires.  This is the first time I felt led to write a  bad review, but as a health professional the raw bacon on not one, but two sandwiches really bothered me.  I can't give any stars, sorry.",

Service at the \"Hotel\" was so slow (it was not busy - 3 servers only had 10 tables all together), 15 minutes to see a waitress and order drinks and another 45 minutes to get food. Food was lukewarm and not very good. Cheapest/greasiest bacon I've ever seen. 6oz steak was more like a 4oz steak. Ordered medium on said steak, but got very well done. Waitresses wear old, skintight Victoria Secret yoga pants (keeping it classy-ha!). And you get all this for only $35 for two people.   Will not be going back.",

Service was all but non existent. -- bits and pieces of meals arrived with no coordination, water not refilled or offered-- and both meals had to be sent back as they were cold and different  than described. The wine had an odd taste as if it were a few days old.  As for the Waygu Burger, it was bland, the cheese wasn't melted and the \"thick cut\" tomato  was hardly thick nor grilled as described.  As for it being made of \"Organic Waygu\" , I can not be certain but I am certain that the taste was non descript.  Oh, lest I forget, it took 40 minutes to bring  chicken fingers for my children and my wife's fish dish was delivered cold with the wrong topping and with rice dish that we are convinced was instant in nature ...  Although our waitress was cordial (and totally overworked), this restaurant is a classic example of mismanagement. Won't be returning anytime soon...",

My partner also had the French onion soup and ordered another one of their house salads that was supposed to come with french fries and grilled salmon with their house dressing. We waited at least 20 man for the soup to be served which turned out to be the worst French onion soup I ever had. They must have used soft bread croutons which sucked all the broth and what was left in the bowl was a slurry of wet bread. When my salad finally came there was no chicken on it.  My partners salad did not have any fries on it with the salmon as advertise on the menu. Our server did bring out the thinnest piece of chicken I have ever seen and at six dollars for the up charge of the chicken it actually made me laugh especially when she brought out a small plate of greased soaked French fries.  I felt bad for our server who is brand-new in which the kitchen evidently let her down. I have had Many meals there before and they were very good so I don't know if there has been a change in the chef or in the overall kitchen staff I hope management makes improvements in the near future. And I almost forgot we split a piece of cheesecake for dessert which was not good.",

Ordered a sandwich as well as the friend I was with ordered a sandwich, we waited the better part of one hour to receive our food. The water tastes very funny that comes with ice. Couldn't drink it. Had juice instead. The piece of lettuce which was to go on the sandwich arrived completely adhered to the plate and wilted. The chicken was grilled but had a very sweet almost Caribbean Flavor to it which was not put in the description of the sandwich and did not go with the barbecue sauce served with it. My friends sandwich was a crab cake sandwich that looked more like crab salad that had been put on the grill to brown it - not good. So all in all I have to say I probably won't come back. I had heard many good things about this place and went on its Past reviews. But I see I'm not the only one that feels it has gone downhill a bit. It's a shame because it's a very key location and very nice atmosphere they just need to step up their food quality and especially they're serving cold and hot things. If they are prepping plates ahead of time they need to hold the lettuce until the sandwiches put on the plate and brought out otherwise the lettuce turns to cook spinach I don't think a lot of customers are going to want that. Last note, the server was friendly enough but he did not offer any explanation for why the sandwiches took the better part of an hour when no customers were there. A couple people were chatting at the bar with the barmaid but there was no explanation visible explanation for why the delay happened. It is not like we ordered a cooked entree. It was lunch. By the time we left at 1:30 there really was only one other set of diners.",

Service was prompt but our lobster mac & cheese appetizer (14.95) Took 30 minutes to arrive. Although it was a large portion it had very little lobster taste and you can tell that it was sitting under the heat lamp for a while. We had to ask twice for our glass of wine. The wedge salad with steak was a half head of iceberg cut in half with all the toppings underneath! That was weird not much presentation. The blue cheese dressing hardly had any blue cheese in it and tasted very bland. I would rate the steak as fair. I ordered the linguine with crabmeat it wasn't bad it did not have very much crab taste as it seemed that the roasted red peppers overpowered everything. Iit came with 6 inches of garlic bread (22.95). I doubt that we will ever go back.

Shame on them for serving such sub standard food. Only redeeming feature was that service was good. Though waitress charged me for dish even though I didn't eat any of it. Talked to the chef who acknowledged problem with my food but there is obviously something going on (bad owner?) that is affecting food quality. Other dishes at my table seemed ok (salmon, burger, salad) but nothing special. One star for back patio one star for server. I would not recommend this place.",

    "text": "I've been coming to this place for over a decade and all I can say is that it has seen MUCH better times. A lot of the good waitstaff/bartenders have moved on and some that remain seem to lack basic customer skills (to be fair, there are some good people still there but you take your chances).   I understand that they have a new chef, which I hope will be a good thing because more recently the food has been oftentimes unpalatable.  For example, I ordered the Shrimp Fra Diabolo, one of my favorites (when well prepared) and what I got was four properly prepared but bland shrimp in a tasteless tomato sauce with blackening seasoning sprinkled around the edge of the bowl. Someone that I was with ordered a sandwich and there was obvious mold where the crust met the bread.  About the best thing to recommend them is a decent happy hour where well drinks, beers on tap and house wines are discounted, though the selection of whites is hampered by a tasteless pinot grigio (most cheap pinots are).  And, the patio is a nice place to sit though not nice enough to make it an eating destination.  I'll probably give it another shot once the new chef has been there, awhile, but it would take a lot of changes at the top to make me want to go back.",

    "text": "We took the family to the Hotel for a cozy winter supper.  We have been enjoying their food and their no-frills, comfortable atmosphere for years.  We were all snuggled in and happily sated with some well made drinks when our Hotel Pate appetizer arrived.  It did not look like the usual.  It wasn't.  We have come to love the creamy, unctuous pate that the Hotel has always served.  Still, we expectantly tucked in.  The plate was adorned with yummy cornichon, pickled shallots and a variety of baby greens.  Sadly, this did not make up for the chopped liver that was supposed to be the\" Hotel\" Pate.  The waitress spoke with the kitchen who said that this was a common complaint of late.  They had switched purveyors and were considering switching back.  We hope they do!  As for the rest of the meal, here goes: The wait staff was good, not off the charts, but solid. The bartender was perfect.  Drinks were cold and not watered down. Highly recommend the gin martini. The food was just fine.  Fries were nothing to write about, and in this day and age, a bar type restaurant can live and die on fries. Veal was good.  Mashed potatoes, bland. Burgers cooked to perfection, but it's hard to get a bad burger in Pittsburgh. Price - well it's not inexpensive.   All in all, we do have a soft spot for this place.  You won't get a bad meal, and you'll have a comfortable experience, surrounded by the local gentry.  If you're in the area, you won't be disappointed.",

Let's start with the fact that the atmosphere was more, \"dark smelly bar you were in Saturday night\" than \"nice Sunday brunch\"...the servers all sat around the bar looking bored and staring down the few people there.  The food was fine, that's the only positive.   We had a \"Dining Deal\" certificate from a friend and they wouldn't honor it. Gave us some crap about there being counterfeits - even though ours had a water mark and was not the same date as the supposed copies. They said the \"big boss would flip out\"...Of course, the \"big boss\" was not there!    I heard about another person who had one and the \"big boss\" loudly berated her in the middle of the place in front of friends.  So, basically, they sold the certificates and then won't accept them. Crappy service, no atmosphere and ripping people off as the icing on the cake!",

Instead he gave me a double shot of bourbon and brought me a teapot of hot water, my choice of teas with a little plate with lemons and honey on it. Honestly I was a little embarrassed by making such a scene and apologized but he obviously wasn't bothered. I thought the effort was really nice and he only charged me for the bourbon.   Our food was also delicious, I had Ahi tuna and my husband had an Academy burger. We finished off with the chocolate tower and it did not disappoint!  Overall it was a very pleasant experience in a cozy place with friendly and accommodating service. What more could you ask for?",

We headed inside and it was empty. The lights were bright and the table felt sticky. I ask for them to turn the lights down, which they didn't.  I ordered the Cajun tuna with a lime tomato onion pepper salsa. The tuna wasn't bad but the salsa was more like chopped veggies then a salsa. It came with snap peas which were the highlight. The red potatoes were old grey and hard. My wife had the chicken Marsala. Good flavor and tender. The mushrooms were over cooked. Our friends had the prime rib and a filet. The prime rib was extremely fatty but good. Our other friend requested her steak medium. It came raw and was sent back. When it came back it was still raw. When pointed out our waitress stated she would have a new steak cooked.when our friend finally got her steak we had been done with our dinners for about 10 minutes. The steak was cooked perfect this time. For desert we all had pecan balls which would have been better if there would have been pecan pieces instead of crumbs. Our waitress was very good. She was attentive and helpful. She did comp the filet which was nice. Overall the food was mediocre, the atmosphere was sub par and our waitress was good.",

Dining, bring a budget and prepare to be underwhelmed--if not totally upset.   Service: we always seem to get 'it's my first day' waiter/waitress' and never sure on menu or specials.    Have given SH a few shots. No more.",

I needed my check for my drink.  I gave up on the food.    Then a woman ran to the kitchen and told them to pack it up to go  Not what I wanted at all. This ordeal made me late to my street festival  Food was soggy. Unappetizing and greasy.  Waste of $50  Other unhappy customers too   Taco Bell would have been better  The bar popcorn even sucked  Trust the bad reviews   A woman named Pam was useless and could care less that my food never came out  The sliders were undercooked and I appealed this with my cc company and they are reversing the charge   They should have never charged me for this food and packed it to go.  Another unhappy customer whose not forgiving",

I think this place is just having an issue of mixed identity. The space is great. It feels like an old school bar and is cozy. It's where I'd want to have a great Manhattan after a long day of work at the office, but the kitchen and atmosphere/space do not meet.  Service was great. I know I saw some reviews that it wasn't for other people but our waiter was helpful, attentive and great. But that's about all.  The menu is very pricey for even Sewickley but with the bar taking up most of the space it just doesn't work. We opted to try their build your own burger, which even if you just are getting the minimum runs about $17/$18 and there is nothing exceptional about it. It's a huge bun, so lots of bread, but not a lot of flavor otherwise going on. Not worth the money.  This place has all the potential but the execution is not there.",

After order an Original Hotel Burger with cheddar cheese and my friend ordered the Academy Burger ( I hate to admit he made the better decision of the two). We both ordered our burgers medium and they can out as expected with a strip of pink, not red line other reviews I read.  Again, everything was great, from the servers to the specials and food down to the cleanliness. Overall the only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is we sat down just before the lunch menu was ending but we could not order the lunch specials.",

After complaining, the waiter finally served our meals...my hamburger was warm and my fries, cold, soggy and old and my girlfriend's crab cakes were not even cooked...just warm.  We once again flagged down the waiter and and informed him of our issue.  What happened next was the best.....he promptly walked into the kitchen and announced, \"Now they are complaining that the food is cold!\"  We could not believe our ears.  When the waiter returned my friend confronted him about his comment and he denied saying it and kept arguing with her.  At one point, we both told him to PLEASE leave us alone.    The manager intervened and comped our meals.  We gladly paid our drink tab and got the heck out of there and will NEVER return.",

We ordered a second round of drinks, and the server returned with them and told us that they were doing last call. Not a problem. We said that would close out and finish our drinks. Paid and finished our conversation/drinks. We noticed that the staff was closing up, so as a male server passed, we let him know that we were on our way out. (We felt as if we were keeping them later than necessary) He loudly said \"you should have been gone already\" and then mumbled about how rude WE were. Are you kidding me?! We were unaware of the closing time and we were completely fine closing out when asked to. I guess we should have taken the hint that this particular server was a jerk when he was angrily closing up the patio umbrellas and stomping around on the patio right around the time they called last call. I understand that it was closing time and he wanted to go home, but he didn't have to make a scene.  If our female server was annoyed with us, she certainly didn't show it. It's called professionalism.  I've worked in the service industry for 12 years, full time, and I simply don't understand why the server felt he needed to lash out on two ladies in our early 30s. What a great first/last impression.",

After our food being in for 40 minutes, our server informed us that the grill wasn't working properly and that our food would be a little bit longer.  We told our server that we have plans and needed to leave in the next half hour.  She went to check with the kitchen and returned saying our food would be rushed and out in 10 minutes.  That would leave us only 20 minutes to eat and pay our checks.  We unfortunately had to cancel our order and leave in order to try and eat elsewhere.  I unfortunately will probably never try to go here again in order to try it.",

The TVs and music were on but the atmosphere was very relaxed. Not loud and not young.  We had giant gin martinis ($11 each) and  wedge salads, his had chicken added which was freshly cooked, warm and moist.
