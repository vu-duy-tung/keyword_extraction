    "text": "Great experience tonight.  Went with the family for a Birthday / Mothers Day celebration.  We made call ahead seating arrangements for 5:00 and showed up right on time.  We were surprised at how crowded the restaurant was considering how early it was; we were lucky enough to get the last parking space.  We put our names in with the hostess and only waited about 20 minutes ( FAR less than the actual wait time).  We took a while to order because we had trouble selecting our meals, but the waitress was very pleasant and checked back often enough.  The food came quickly and was delicious.  The only problem was that my wife's steak was cooked to medium instead of well done.  The waitress noticed as my wife cut into it.  Before my wife could even say anything, the waitress said \"Ooh, that's not well done....let me take that back for you\". I was impressed that a) she remembered how my wife wanted her steak cooked, considering she had a lot of large tables on a busy night, and b) that she offered to take it back before we even asked.  The manager came back a few minutes later with the steak and personally wanted to make sure that we were happy and that all of the food was good.  He even made small talk with us for a few minutes.  Both the waitress and manager went above and beyond and made our experience great in addition to great food.",

I got there 10 minutes early and they actually had it ready.  Everything was packed perfectly.   I got the small quesadilla and it was still 4 big triangles full of chicken and a side of honey mustard-tasting sauce. It was still crispy and piping hot, even after a 15 minute drive home.    I also got their blue cheese chopped salad, which is my favorite restaurant salad!   Warning: a little of the vinaigrette goes a long way.   I also got a mini double chocolate parfait and it wasn't that mini.  It was really good!.  And bonus, enough food left for lunch tomorrow  :)    I'd definitely go back for curbside take out...no crowds and no screaming children. :)",

The best part is my boyfriends steak was suppose to be medium rare but it came out well done. He didn't say a word about and was just going with the flow not wanting to be needy and she totally saw the steak and insisted it be sent back. The manager came over afterwards and talked us. It wasn't even that big of a deal and they treated us with such respect and thanks. Literally the best service I ever had. I couldn't recommend them enough and of course , amazing food!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that this is more of a 1.5 star review BUT I'm rounding down because my service was THE WORST service I have ever experienced in my entire life, and I am a former server so I am understanding but there was no excuse for how bad Tony (and he never introduced himself I got his name off of our receipt), our server, was on Friday 1/23/15 (and yes I used the date hoping management will see this) in the area around the bar. If I were rating solely on food alone, I'd be giving Outback a 3. I don't typically like chain restaurants but, honestly, both my dining companion and I enjoyed our meals. However, as I stated already, service was atrocious and that left me with enough of an impression that I will never, ever return to this location.  We were seated around 7:50pm at our table. We were told it would be a 30 minute wait but it was actually only 20 which was nice. We began to peruse the menu and I noticed a female server that was servicing the table caddy-corner to ours. I expected she was our server but after she walked by our table multiple times in the first 10 minutes we were there, I went out on a limb and guessed she was not to be our server. I also noticed a male that was servicing the table behind us. He was making small talk with them after bringing out their entrees. He then left their table and again, I went out on a limb and guessed he was not our server either. We easily had been sitting there for 20 minutes with open menus when finally, after making additional small talk with the table behind us, guess who comes over?? Tony-who obviously knew we were there and failed to even greet us within 20 minutes. His greeting, when he made his way over, wasn't even \"Hi, my name is ______, sorry about the wait.\" It was \"What do you want to drink? Are you ready to order?\" We ordered 2 beers and we did put in an appetizer at the time, but I was still debating what I wanted so he said he'd be \"right back\" with our drinks. ANOTHER 15 minutes passed (after more additional small talk with the table behind us) before he came back with our beers, bread, and our appetizer. No apology this time either. Our appetizer was firecracker grilled shrimp served with crostini, tomatoes, and a spinach dip sauce. It was actually very tasty. By the time he delivered the appetizer, we were ready to order. I ordered the firecracker salmon with mixed veggies and my companion ordered the prime rib. Our entrees came out rather quickly, but we had empty drinks for quite some time and never saw Tony until he brought out our meals. To continue the atrocious service, he was trying to push us out of there when we weren't even halfway done with our entrees! He came back when we were about halfway through and said, verbatim (and not even asking us how everything was), \"You guys don't want anything crazy like dessert do you?\" Before either of us could get \"no\" out, he was dropping our check and walked away. We never saw him again and just paid cash and left it on the table. I realize that one goes to a restaurant for the food, however, although the food we had was acceptable, the manner in which we were treated was horrendously rude, unacceptable, and, frankly, the manager at this location should be embarrassed that such atrocious service was given to a paying guest. It is because of this terrible service that, although the food was decent, I will never allow myself or anyone I am with to spend money in this particular Outback ever again.",

We were sat in outside corner of restaurant, our booth was freezing even the actual seat was cold. I am usually on the warm side but, had to keep my large down jacket the whole time. Took forever to place order, got the complimentary pumpernickel bread-I was starving and still could not eat more than one piece, as it was lousy. Got our salad but, we had to just stare at them for about 10 minutes waiting for silverware. Drinks not refilled no one who worked there seemed to care about most customers wearing coats during their meal. Asked for Manager-Rich, said he would check on heat and take 20 whole % off our bill. No dishes ever cleared, waiter finally brings check and - of coarse no $ taken off. Had to wait again for this to be addressed . Spent 2 and a 1/2 hours (freezing) with no apps or dessert.",

The mashed potatoes, while good, were portioned out to maybe 1 cup at best, and I thought they had forgotten to put any sort of dressing on my salad, until I got to a few leaves that had a very small amount spread across them. At least the lobster tail, albeit small, was tasty. We spent $80-90 on our meal. For that amount, I certainly expected better quality. I'll take my business elsewhere, from here on out.",

Our country will look exactly the same city to city without our local restaurants.  It's a part of our local culture and heritage and we would be poorer without them.    The food at Outback is consistent and good.  I had a perfectly cooked chicken breast with veggies and a side of garlic mashed potatoes.  You have to be careful with the menu as the calories are really terrifically high all over the place.  The veggies were really carefully prepared as well and still had plenty of bite and life left in them too.  The value is good.

Bad experiences.  I ordered a sirloin well done when i was here with a side of mushrooms.  The steak was so overdone it ceased to be edible though it had butter sauce smothering its dryness.  The mushrooms seemed drenched in water and quite tasteless.  My take out experience resulted in a filet that was spongy and tasteless.   The baked potato was burnt and the sides were missing.  The last take out (filet well done no pink) gave me a practically rare piece of steak that made my nephew scream as he jates bloody meat.  Not sure whats going on.

My 1 year old daughters grilled cheese sandwich was two pieces of unmelted cheese stuck between two burnt pieces of bread, my 3 year old sons cheeseburger was burnt to a crisp and the fries were soggy and raw. I ordered a medium rare steak and it was purple cold in the middle. I sent it back and they brought it back dry and tough like beef jerky. I forced about half of it down because I didn't want to make a scene since it was with my 2 kids and wife. I just paid and left and won't be back.

I understand that sometimes mistakes happen in the kitchen and get backed up (because I work in a restaurant) but the table behind us was seated after us and received their meals and were finished before we ever got ours. It also wasn't at a busy time, around 830.  Once the food came I was a bit frustrated because we waited for almost an hour.

They are known for their steaks and appetizers such as the \"Bloomin' Onion.\" Each and every time I have come here I have recieved terrific service from courageous waiters and waitresses. Upon entering, the first thing I noticed were my eyes adjusting to the dim lighting. This could be a down-side for humans. Usually there's no wait, but if there is a wait, it is never too long. The establishmemt is mostly comprised of booths, but has several tables as well.  The Menu: The menu consists of hamburgers, steaks, and something that will most likely please you.  The cheese fries are a wonderful appetizer. It's a large plate of seasoned french fries topped with several melted cheeses and bacon bits. This apetizer is not for weight watchers and can easily appetize 4 people. If you want an appetizer, I suggest you pounce on this one. They serve Coca Cola products and O'Douls as well!  For dinner, I ordered my usual: a hamburger (nothing on it) with bacon. Each and every time the hamburger is professionally cooked to your liking. I have never had any problem with the cooking of my hamburger. It comes with a side of seasoned fries. Beware, however, these burgers are quite large! If you like hamburgers and are really hungry, Outback Steakhouse is your asylum from McDonalds or Wendy's.  Overall, the Outback Steakhouse gets a 4 out of 5 star rating for their superior quality food and excellent service but don't get the last star because of their dim lighting.",

And Namaste, which is a bit closer to the city, didn't open until 5pm. This Outback opens at 4PM during the week.   For some reason I think this Outback used to be someone's house. I could be wrong about that. I don't believe it's been here all that long. To date, it's also the only Outback I've ever been to. My last visit was a few years ago.   I have push/pull feelings about Outback's fare, particularly when it comes to their Baby Back Ribs. Since I was craving ribs after attending the Heinz Field Rib Fest over the weekend, I was...in the mood.   Again push/pull. I honestly do prefer my ribs to be tender. They should dissolve on the palate in my opinion. The sauce can be tangy, sweet, spicy (I like them all), but it better be good.  And their sauce isn't one to complain about. It's a thick sauce that's tangy enough. The ribs strip off the bone with such ease I barely needed to use my fingers. However, they have the flavor and consistency of bacon or beef jerky. To me that wasn't a bad thing in itself, but it's not what I prefer, and I doubt most rib lovers prefer them this way either.   Other than that, the side dish of soft-bellied fries with crispy, seasoned armor went well with the capable ranch dressing. The house salad was ideal with Outback's own dressing; a mustard vinaigrette that was probably the best house dressing I've had in many moons. And they already dress the salad with it (it's on the bottom of the veggies), which is proper. Although, the waiter offered to serve it on the side in case I didn't like it and also offered to replace anything else that wasn't to my liking.  Outback gets an A+ for service fer sure.   My date (she got steak and coconut crusted shrimp) and I got The Sweet Adventure Sampler for dessert, which consists of a slice of their Classic Cheesecake (we got the raspberry sauce), a slice of the Carrot Cake, and a small version of Chocolate Thunder From Down Under, their take on the hot fudge brownie sundae, my fave rave sundae of them all. Ironically, I liked the cheesecake best as it was rather flawless. The Carrot Cake was good enough with its cream cheese icing but could have been a little more moist. The CTFD is made with Blue Bell ice cream and has the standard toppings with choco shavings added for good measure. It was ok, but like the carrot cake, the brownie could have been richer and was also a tad overnuked. These are minor complaints, however.   So yeah, 4 stars. I'm going to try their steaks the next time I come here, if I come back, and while I had a decent experience, I'm not absolutely dying to return. For a chain restaurant, they are pretty rock solid and have waitstaff that are quite good at what they do.   OH! I forgot about the lemonade. It's pretty darn tart yet refreshing.   What is it with me and lemonade lately?   OH! That pumpernickel bread rocks harder than AC/DC or Angel City (lesser known Aussie band). I dig how they serve it warm to you upon being seated with that whipped butter and that large Crocodile Dundee knife. It's so barbaric and so metal. \\m/  Based on this location, Outback honestly doesn't suck or screw anything up.",

That was a bit frustrating, but we have never had issues before, so I'm going to choose to see it as an anomaly.   The wait to get a seat was nothing compared to the wait to eat. It took way. too. long. I know it's a holiday and so there were more people than usual, but I would think a chain restaurant would learn to brace for events like this. But I would guess this is not the norm for non-holiday events, so this review probably will only apply to you for those special days.   Bread & butter is a highlight. I ordered the salmon and it was delicious. I appreciate the fact that you can switch up sides with no additional charge.   You know what you will get when you go to a place like Outback, so that's a win.   I'm personally more of a fan of non-chain establishments, but this isn't a bad option for consistently good food.",

The servers never brought us the bread that's supposed to come, with the butter. We ordered the filet lobster combo meal to share requesting filet medium rare.

The staff are always friendly and get your food to you fast.  In terms of the food, I think Outback has some very underrated dishes.  Starting off with their bread.  I don't know what kind it is, but it is some of the best bread you will ever eat.  I am usually almost full on the bread alone.  For appetizers, my favorite is the mac and cheese balls.  They are different than any other fried mac and cheese app I have had.  A very gooey white cheese combined with a light fry makes for a great dish.    My go to meal every time here is the bloomin burger.  Outback definitely uses fresh meat because it is cooked to a perfect medium rare every time I get it.  The bloomin pedals and bloomin sauce to top the burger are an amazing combination that makes this one of my favorite and most unique tasting burgers.  Another favorite dish that I have had are the coconut shrimp.  I don't even like coconut for the most part, but the way they are done at Outback makes all the difference.  They are crisp and flavorful and pair perfectly with the remoulade sauce that comes with them.",

It's funny, because this is the place that has PHOTOGRAPHS of steaks, showing what \"medium rare\" and \"medium\" will really look like!  And when I say \"medium\" to the server, he/she will say back \"now that's a warm, pink center,\" just to confirm.  \"Yes,\" I say.  ...Then it comes out well done, brown, tough, dry, and without a trace of pinkness.  So the salads are good, the little loaves of bread are good, the occasional \"bloomin onion\" is nice.  But this is a steak place, and you've GOT to get the steaks right.",

I ordered the 18oz. Sirloin medium. French onion soup & baked potato. not to mention the 22oz. Samuel Adams winter. Ya know , sometimes , you just gotta go for it ! And I did.  I can't give this experience a better review. Well , except the HORRIBLE dinner music choice. I'm sorry , but RAP music does NOT belong in a family place in my humble opinion. WAY to loud and very annoying. The Food & service were top notch for sure. but please ,,,,, nice quiet jazz ? classical ? maybe some  R&B , or maybe no music at all might have been best.

I literally couldn't eat my dinner because it was so bitter tasting from the salt.  I told the waitress and she said they get a lot of complaints about the salt level of their food.    I told them I didn't want a replacement because everyone else was almost done by this time and instead of removing it from my check, the next thing I know the manager comes over with a \"lite seasoning\" replacement meal.   I didn't say anything because it was my birthday and we had great service through our dinner, but I couldn't eat that dinner either because life salt to them means salt encrusted.    I won't be going back to Outback because that level of salt can't be good for people.   It's a shame too because I used to love their steak and shrimp.  :(",

The filet mignon was tolerable but the outside was coated with lots of spices which made it hard to taste the steak.   While ordering the waiter told me \"you can have a salad as a side\" instead of offering me choices which the menu indicated it came with a choice of 2 sides, which I didn't choose he just said \"sweet potato and salad\" and moved onto my husband to order.

Outback needs to know not everyone is a steak idiot. Every time I go there I am sorely disappointed and tonight was no exception. I keep going back hoping it will be different that I will be wowed, instead I am irritated. I'm a glutton for punishment ... no more.  I knew I was going to Outback for dinner and anticipated the Victoria's Filet Mignon all day. I ordered it medium are. I was hopeful, I mean, the salad was good. No bread was served. why is that? Why do they not have bread?  Anyhow, the steak arrived and I and my dinner partner had to question if it was a filet Mignon, it wasn't even a half inch thick, and when I cut it to check for tenderness, it was like shoe leather.  No Filet that I know needs that much work to cut. The waitress responded, \"It's six ounces that's why it's small.\"   I have never seen a filet that thin it was less than a half an inch. As you can see by my picture, I had to really tear it apart to cut it. Anyone who knows steaks knows it isn't a filet mignon. It was a filet, but I believe they ran out and the cook just cut the filet from the porterhouse.  Anyhow, I took a bite. ONE bite it was so spicy, I couldn't eat it. The delay heat. You know the kind, \"Good. Good.\" then ...\" WTH?\" mouth on fire I wanted to scream. My lips burned. There was so much pepper, it was so hot they could have burned out a virus with it.  When I complained, I was told it was the seasoning and did I want another steak with no seasoning. Now, why would I do that?  \"How about half seasoning?\" Why should I come to a steakhouse and not have a seasoned steak? Nowhere on the menu does it say, \"Hey, this steak is doused with pepper.\"  I have been at outback, and my chief complaint is they never know how to cook a steak medium rare. I have never had the seasoning so hot I couldn't eat it.  The woman in the booth behind me ... didn't eat hers, she told the manager it was too spicy.  A pathetic over a peppered piece of meat passed off as a filet mignon.  They comped my meal, of course, they did, I didn't eat it. I left Outback dissatisfied and hungry.  It never does any good to reach out to Outback, they don't get back to you .. AT ALL.  I have in the past actually reached out to compliment the wait staff .. I never heard a word.  Hey Outback, if you're gonna call yourself a steak house, learn how to cook a steak and for goodness sake, serve a filet mignon when one is ordered, not a tough piece of meat that you try to pass off as a filet mignon.",

The food has always been pretty consistent which is why we have gone back despite the subpar service we've had. Tonight we didn't even make it to a table.   We pulled in on Saturday night around 5:00 and I dropped my wife off to go in and get us on the list. I parked and brought my three kids in from the car to find that we had only been quoted a 5 minute wait. After watching a few tables that arrived after us get seated before us, I went to the host stand and inquired about where we were in the que. The hostess said that we were next to be seated and that they were clearing a table for us right now.  After this we watched two more parties, both of which were parties of 6 or more, get seated ahead of us. At this point we were at a 20 minute wait on a quoted 5 minute wait and had watched too many tables that arrived after us get seated so we decided to try our luck at another restaurant.   As we were dropping off our pager at the host stand the manager overheard us telling the hostess that we were leaving and asked why. She was very polite and offered that we were next to be seated. After hearing that we were \"next\" once before and waiting 20 minutes on a 5 minute wait, we had had enough, though, and left.  I suspect it will be a while before we head back to that location as the service has been less than stellar on multiple occasions. We still will visit other locations and enjoy Outback, but this particular store needs some help in the service department.",

    "text": "I noticed a number of negative reviews from other people but came to Outback anyway. My husband and I were both happy with our meals. I opted for the 6 oz sirloin with coconut shrimp. I order my steak rare. This was prepared medium rare, but I would expect that from similar caliber restaurants (I wouldn't mark down the rating for that). If you are a stickler about your steak temperature, you might want to start with a degree under. The happy hour drinks are a good price ($5) and a reasonable variety. The menu lists then as 4-6 pm every day and they did honor this on Saturday. My husband had the Alice chicken with coconut shrimp. He thought it was very tasty. There were comments about the pepper glaze. My steak did have a pepper topping. It was not overpowering or overdone. If you are not sure about pepper, ask them to reduce the amount. Overall, we had good service, a good meal for a good price and the food we received matched what we ordered.",
