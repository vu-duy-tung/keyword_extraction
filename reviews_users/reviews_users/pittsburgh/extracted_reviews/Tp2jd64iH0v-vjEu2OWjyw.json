Being from a seafood-rich area in the South, Red Lobster was always at the top of my \"Ain't No Way In Hell I'm Eating There\" list for both reasons. Then I find myself hungry, wanting a place with published nutritional information, and in Pittsburgh. Here I come Red Lobster!  The interior is fine, and the waitstaff were nice. I got a bowl of New England Clam Chowder, grilled shrimp house salad and a glass of wine for about $15. The chowder was fine, but the salad was disappointing. All of the lettuce was the white part of iceberg. Zero green lettuce in this salad. The waitress noticed that I only ate the shrimp off the top, and asked if there was a problem. She was sweet about it, but when I said that I wasn't going to eat a salad that was solely comprised of white iceberg, she told me that next time I could request Romaine.  Well, there's not going to be a next time, and I shouldn't have to request that my salad be made with actual green lettuce. Call me demanding.",

    "text": "Ok so I grew up in New England, so I am fond of lobster, crab cakes, and fishies. In the last few years I've really gone on a seafood binge. There is just nothing better than a lobster dipped in a vat of butter, and I feel no guilt, about throwing them in a boiling pot of water. Crab legs are fantastic when served right, and while rockfish is the best non-clawed seafood item.  If I was to own a seafood restaurant, I would get rid of all the posh decors, and make it look like a barge from Alaska's Deadly Catch television series.  You would get fresh seafood brought in that day, but I couldn't promise the best of service, but rather a more salty experience from the staff that I would hire. There would be a crabbing vessel simulator that the kids could play in, after taking the required Dramamine to prevent messes, and the B-52's \"Rock Lobster\" would get played often over the stereo system.   While some may not like this approach, I find Red Lobster to be rather boring. Its just too corporate, and lacks any creativity, as I cannot tell one location from another. Even other large corporations allow for some individuality with regards to dining areas and decorations, but each Red Lobster looks like a cookie cutter project designed by the geniuses at headquarters. There are simple booths and tables, set fairly well apart from each other, and the usual paintings of maritime activity. You can expect to see a few lobster traps, and a fishing reel, but there's not much more to make your meal more visually appealing.   There are some hits on the menu though, I have found a favorite on the Red Lobster menu. I am absolutely in love with their Skewered Jumbo Shrimp Meal. At a cost of $14.75, you get a wonderful value for the money with this, and these shrimp are huge. They remind me of the ones you can sometimes get at the D.C. Wharf, or certain Chinese restaurants, because they are the biggest shrimp I've ever seen and eaten. They are marinated with delicious spices, brought to you fully cooked on the skewers off of the grill, and they are placed upon rice and broccoli. The lobster butter adds a bit of flavor, although it doesn't need a lot, as these shrimp have just the right amount of spices to them.   I like the Snow Crab Legs Meal, which is a pound of these tasty morsels. The legs are gigantic as well, and they've always been steamed to perfection. A lot of places seem to mess up crab legs, because I've often had rubbery crab legs that didn't taste very good. With Red Lobster you can rest assured, much like you used to be able to at the now out of business Chesapeake Bay Restaurants, that your crab legs will be cooked just right. They are great with the sauce, and I like these with a side of broccoli as well, and their price of $17.99 is competitive. You can order an additional pound for $4.99, which makes it an even better deal.   The one meal that I had at Red Lobster that was a great disappointment, was the Ultimate Feast. This is supposed to be their signature meal, and at $25 I do expect to be amazed, since that is a considerable amount of money for a dinner. Their lobster tail was hideous, because it suffered from freezer burn. In addition, the meat wasn't fresh, which the freezing and thawing couldn't save, and it wasn't even split open properly. The fried shrimp that come with it are so heavily breaded, that you'll need at least two glasses of water to quench your thirst. While the crab legs and garlic shrimp are great, they can't make up for the main two failures, and especially this hideous waste of perfectly good lobster.   Service has been a major disappointment, and a contributing factor to why I cannot recommend this chain. Each time I have gone for lunch or dinner, even on weekdays, there has been a wait for a table. It would be one thing if the food was that good, but since it is not, I'd rather not waste my time. In addition, a lot of these lines are due to staff disorganization, with hosts of high school age, that just seem to be collecting a paycheck. I could be wrong about this, but there is a serious disconnect at the front desk, from the rest of the dining areas.  There have been occasions where I've had average service at a Red Lobster, but for the most time I have felt alone and neglected. I don't know if they just don't have enough employees, and they are giving their servers six or seven tables, but there just isn't a lot of personal atttention here.",

    "text": "I don't know, man.  This Red Lobster just didn't measure up to other Red Lobsters I've been to.  Granted it has been over a year since I've been to any Red Lobster so maybe there were changes across all Red Lobsters.  But that's just me giving them the benefit of the doubt.  To start, we ordered a new menu item, Lobster Nachos, as an appetizer.  It was disappointing as it was mostly cheese and sour cream and hardly any lobster.  Thus it ended up coming off as just a heavy dish.  For dinner, I ordered the stuffed flounder (not sure the exact name).  It was pretty good.  The portion was about right for the price.  The only downside being that it was a bit too salty -- some lemon juice might've helped.  And the cheddar bay biscuits.  This was the main reason we made the drive from Pittsburgh city to Red Lobster.  The biscuits were disappointing.  Like the nachos, it was also heavy.  It was also flat as if not enough yeast (if any?) was added.  It was mushier than fluffy.  Utterly disappointing, but still ok.  Ok at best.  If you like the biscuits from fried chicken places, this is still lighter than those and a class above.  But yea.  The one redeeming quality was the service.  The food came out surprisingly quickly, except for the biscuits, which the waitress forgot to get for us.  However, she did bring the biscuits and gave us 4 biscuits to-go as an apology.    Excellent service, but food was not of the Red Lobster glory that I've come to know.",

As we walk in the hostess is eating mouth full and chewing very sexy!  We are looking at all you can eat shrimp on T.V. and we go there and it was not the special.  I   enjoyed the biscuit but my Cesar salad was so sad. I go there for that reason. Our mash potatoes were instant who serves instant taters on $80.00 lunch bill plus tip? Our waiter was not informative and absent. We ended up taken our food home. My son is 6'4 at 250lbs. He could put away 5 meals. It was tasteless and shameful. My youngest didn;t even want the shrimp. He has been eating shrimp his entire life. In todays economy and money being so tight this type of serves will close doors quick. As we exit there are at least 6 staff members smoking out the back door. Maybe they should take that time to make fresh mash taters. I will try out Butler Red Lobster but with reservations. As for the shitty lunch we received at the Mcknight restaurant we won't be back. Not to mention I made all you can eat shrimp and crab legs for 3 people for just under $30.00. My family was stuffed germ free and we never left our home. The point is we go out for the serves and atmosphere when big chains loss that they are failing in a big way.",

    "text": "Pardon my unoriginal choice of dinner spot while driving through Pittsburgh, but the garlic cheese biscuits at Red Lobster beckoned me and I gladly obliged. After my fourth biscuit, it was a completely different story, seeing how my recommended upper limit of sodium and fat intake could have easily been reached by consuming one biscuit alone.  My Maui Luau shrimp and salmon were juicy and topped with the right amount of sweet and tangy sauce, with a hint of spiciness. My parents ordered the broiled seafood platter and the fried seafood platter. As much as I hate to stereotype, it's easy to guess who ordered what. Surprisingly, my mom's broiled platter was not as healthful as it sounded on paper. Aside from the scallops, the garlic shrimp scampi and the stuffed flounder were just as calorific (if not more) than my dad's fried platter which consisted of fried fish, crab cakes, popcorn shrimp, and clam strips.  This particular RL looked and smelled like the other RLs found across the states. You've got your healthy eaters picking away at salads and you've got your gluttons happily stuffing their faces with, not one, but two fried platters. Okay, so perhaps my inhaling four of those trans-fat ladened biscuits and finishing off my plate wasn't so bad afterall. Either way, RL is a chain I'll frequent from time to time due to its ever-changing menu and its tasty creations. Oh, and those goddamn delicious biscuits too!",

Today was my yearly visit because I was craving seafood and I live in Pittsburgh. I had the Admiral's feast. First the salad, it was drowning in dressing.What I found underneath was spoiled, slimey greens. Unfortunately, this was after I took a bite. I showed the waiter and he was very appaligenic   and replaced my salad.Next, the platter, the bay scallops were no bigger than the tips of my little finger, but tasted good. The fried clams were also good, but no better than from the frozen food section of the supermarket. The fish use to be a white fish, cod or haddock, but now it's tilapia and very small filets. The shrimp was decent sized and all seafood was cooked perfectly. The baked potato was the smallest potato that I have ever had in a restaurant. If they are going to be stingy on the food then they should use smaller plates. The biscuits are the best. I should save myself the bother and just stop and get a dozen of the bisquits. All in all, I wish I had better choices for seafood in Pgh.",

I got the shrimp skewers with rice pilaf and green beans, and she got the pick-two combo with grilled salmon and coconut shrimp.   We had a great start with piping hot biscuits, but it was all downhill from there.  We waited 10-15 minutes for our salads - I got coleslaw - and an hour for our meals.  Yes, an HOUR!  I thought I was going to start eating my hand.  Keep in mind that it wasn't a lunch rush by any means.  We were like, one of 5 tables in the restaurant.  I have no idea what happened, but I probably could've gone and fished my lunch faster.    To make matters worse, the entrees were awful - definitely NOT worth the wait.  My friend's salmon was WHITE. What the eff? When has salmon ever been white?  The taste was off, too.  Just a bad experience overall, although I give them props for their coconut shrimp - the only redeeming part of the meal.    Anywho, our waitress felt bad we waited so long so she brought us dessert on the house.  She's the reason this RL got even TWO stars.  If you're looking for a place to eat, go to Cheesecake or CPK.

Maybe my palate is spoiled thanks to Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille.  Oh, dammit...yum! Sorry, I had a moment.  A few weeks ago I ordered take out on my way home because I wanted seafood and I wanted it nicely packed and ready to eat immediately when I walked in the door.  I haven't had pasta in a while so shrimp alfredo was my thrill for the evening.  Along with it came the infamous cheddar bay biscuits and a salad.   When I arrived home and unpacked my order, I noticed the pasta barely had enough sauce on it with a few shrimp scattered about and the tossed salad I ordered ended up being a caesar salad with some aged lettuce and dried parmesan cheese.  I mean, the entire meal looked pathetic.  I reached out to Red Lobster and they ended up sending me a gift card to make it up to me.   Today, I was in the area and decided to use my gift card.  I'm happy to report that my meal was error free and the service was great.  Some of their dishes are too salty but I like the fact that they offer a wide selection of entrees which cater to your wants/needs whether you're going healthy or having a \"to heck with it\" moment.  My fish was cooked just right and tasted fresh.    While I don't see myself as a True \"regular\" at Red Lobster, I won't rule them out entirely.  It's the service that I receive with a smile and their willingness to own up to and fix their mistakes scores them points in my book.",

I had Long Island  iced tea it was alright. Service was great too.",

I wish I knew how to use this yelp app sooner then I learned. last Aug 20014..my husband and I brought our son there for lunch for his birthday. he lovessss the crablegs!  however our server looked like she wanted to basically kill someone. it felt awkward and she made us feel very unwanted, we are not pain in the a** people at all and we always OVER TIP...  she never once smiled..she never made eye contact...she basically was terrible... he wanted dessert it being his birthday and all, and she brought the check before we cld even ask for it. oh but when we did it was like the end of the world.  I will always continue to come there, but I hope by now this girl is gone. she was just not meant to be a server!!",

Even the petite green beans have butter, which is what makes it so freakin' delicious.  They have a deal right now that's 4 for 15.99,and it's awesome.  It comes with a cup of soup, salad or cole slaw, am entree, and dessert.  Of course you have to choose from what's listed, but it's a generous list and they all sound good.  I like the key lime pie...it has a raspberry drizzle!  I dad hates citrusy stuff but he like this pie!",

A bit disappointed this past Saturday evening when we stopped for dinner on our way to a party.  The server got my wife's order wrong and then asked my wife if she wanted to keep the meal and take what she wanted from it as they could not serve it to anyone else.  So she did and took the lobster tail When her correct meal arrived the lobster tail that should have been there was missing.   We asked why and she stated the manager told her to take it off since she had the one from the other meal.  Sorry tacky !  Not what I expect from Red Lobster.   We'll still go back but very disappointed.  Barb, our favorite server where are you ? BTW - we've been going to this location for 17 years now.  Still love it !",

The only real sign I saw relating to Lobsterfest was the huge, live, lobster-filled tank set up in the waiting area of the lobby.  Kind of sent second thoughts on the lobster choice. Poor things were all huddled together trying not be chosen as someone's next meal.  The lobster fest menu was not as exciting as I expected.   The commercials that lured me in for a love affair with lobsters fell short.  Not sure if I had higher expectations,  but I did not see page after page of selections.  Since this was my first fest, I do not know how it compares to previous promotions.  I ordered the surf and turf and it was satisfying for the most part.  Lobster tail was a bit skimpy. Our server was pleasant and very attentive. Nice meal overall, but I was expecting more .",

The waitress we had (Gay) was so nice and had great customer service. I'm sure it was the end of her shift and she was ready to get out of there but you couldn't tell by how helpful she was and for the end of the night the food came out very hot and fresh. I have visited this red lobster before and always thought of it as a hit or miss...but this time it was a definite hit. Hit the Spot!

If it was not for the Lime It would have had no different taste other than the cola.  Now I will say the muscles were excellent , except for the fact that a good 1/3 were closed and not editable.  We were seated in the bar instead of the main dinning room - which was near the front door. Needless to say with the outside temp a cold 18 deg F. We were treated to a cold blast of air every time the doors were opened being a Friday eve. This was often.  Now for the main meal. The dehydrated mashed potatoes were cold and pasty. The green beans were also cold, limp, stringy, basically not editable.  I ordered the lobster bisque as an appetizer ,  it came like warm, pasty. Not creamy, with no apparent lobster meat.  Since this was Lobster Fest time. One would think that seafood would be their speciality. I ordered one of their specialties and upgraded to a Filet MR.  When served, the extremely small 3 oz tail was way over broiled and the Fillet came back raw.  Now the waitress must have informed the Manager as a 2nd order of Muscles appeared and later the Manager appeared to apologize about the quality of the food.  Both the Manager and Waitress were very nice and professional. The Manager did discount our check though most restaurants would have removed the whole meal from the bill.  Because the waitress was very busy, service was slow as when I ordered my first drink from the waitress it was not delivered for some time. I could see that the bar was half empty by this time and therefore the delay must have been that the waitress did not place the drink order.   The bottom line here is the service was average, the food was poorly prepared and served. As this is a chain resturant, one would think that the food would be of a better quality. Their is. I excuse for the poorly mixed drinks, especially at those prices.   Maybe next time. If their is to be a next time.",

Upon entering, the bathrooms are immediately to the left of the entrance and they stink up the whole front section of the restaurant. During my wait to be seated, the strong smell of cleaning chemicals and human waste almost ruined my appetite. Luckily, my husband and I were seated in the back so this wasn't much of a problem during our meal.   Our waitress was very polite and attentive. However, I couldn't help but notice that there wasn't much of a concern for cleanliness in any of the employees. When our waitress brought out our napkins, there were crumbs all in the napkins. Instead of replacing them, she said, \"that's from the biscuits.\" Ok, but for all I know, that could be from someone else's old biscuit basket. Another employee brought out our plates and there were items hanging off the plates, touching the trays. This was served to us without any hesitation. Other unsanitary incidents occurred that I won't go into detail. I understand that this is a little nit-picky, but my husband ended up getting sick after this dinner and we can't help but wonder the reason why.   For food, he ordered coconut shrimp and I ordered crab legs. It all tasted alright, but you can't really go wrong with steaming crab legs and refrying frozen coconut shrimp.   I've had better experiences at other Red Lobsters so I'm not totally against this seafood chain. This location, however, I am not a fan.",

    "text": "This went from our favorite place to eat to never eating there again. We got the lobster mac and cheese which was $25 ( with barely any lobster in it) and it was so fishy tasting that I thought it was rotten. We each took a bite and threw it all in the trash ( take out order). This was second time in a month that our dinners went straight in the trash. I highly recommend that you do yourself a favor and pick someplace else to eat.",

Lots of options and combos to pick from.  Best part of our visit was our wonderful server, Jada. She was not only very attentive the whole time we were there, but ran out to catch me at the car just in time to give me the credit card I had left behind! THANK YOU!",

    "text": "I've been a fan of Red Lobster since the early nineties when it used to be a weekly thing--lunch at Red Lobster then the movies with my mom. We always went to the location in Robinson. After an appointment out this way, we decided to lunch at this location. Big win! THIS lunch was everything as I remembered--we had the Walt's shrimp--perfectly done and so flavorful! I had the baked potato with butter--fluffy, salty outside and full of flavor. My Caesar salad was perfect--crispy romaine, croutons and SHAVED--yeah, you heard that right-SHAVED Parmesan with their delicious Caesar dressing--just like old times--quantity and quality UNCHANGED!!! The biscuits were delicious and fluffy--albeit a tad smaller but still garlicky, flavorful cheesy goodness through and through! The ice tea(always been my favorite iced tea!) tastes as refreshing and flavorful as always. Finally, our server--a very efficient young man--was perfect! This was a truly yummy lunch that is sure to lure us back to this McKnight road location. Robinson Red Lobster better step up their game because THIS spot in North Hills is well worth our trip!!!",

We ordered the soup, salad, entree, and dessert at $17.99 each person, Monday through Thursday. All the food was hot and fresh. We asked if she could take a picture of us and she did. During the time there, another server offered us more water. We had a good anniversary dinner. Thanks!",

    "text": "We stopped in last night for a date night. Bobby has been working alot since his promotion and my sister has been staying with us during her college internship since we live in the city. Needless to say, we dont get too much alone time and Bobby suggested a date night which sounded perfect on a random Tuesday night. I had a gift card that could be used here, Olive Garden, Bahama breeze or Longhorn. We chose here since seafood did sound good at the time. Shout out to the person who gave me that gift card.. drinks were on you! :)  To start, we each ordered a margarita and the stuffed mushrooms. They were stuffed with lobster and seafood stuff. Not too bad. The mushrooms were small so this would be a perfect appetizer for two people.   For dinner, Bobby ordered the Snow Crab Legs which came with 1 lb of crab legs, little potatoes, corn on the cob. He got the add on as well which was an extra 1/2 lb of crab legs.  It looked delish and i also tasted some. Not bad!   I was in mood for shrimp and took advantage of the Big Shrimp Festival. You had the opportunity to choose 2 different shrimp dishes, a side + a salad for $17. I believe I could've also chosen 3 for around $20.  I ordered the shrimp scampi linguine and shrimp tempura. Both were good and the tempura came with a yummy sauce.   After another Margarita, i was stuffed!! I wanted to order the chocolate cake and ice cream so bad and contemplated it for a good 15 minutes but just couldn't handle any more food lol. Bobby ordered the Irish Coffee which was whisky and (iced?) coffee. Yum I tried it and it was amazing! The best dessert drink I've tasted in awhile.  Ali was our server and she was so sweet and friendly. Every employee we came in contact with was super nice.  Great date night.",
