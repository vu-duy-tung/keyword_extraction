I believe there was only 1 link of sausage in the calzones cut up into little pieces... Very disappointing. Along with that my wife ordered a sausage panini, it contained  1 link of sausage  split  in half which did not nearly fill the bun ... Where's the meat, all bun. The bill was $54.00 and that is without drinks or tip!!",

Chicken is not expensive guys! But I think the thing that was THE WORST are the waitresses! Just AWEFUL! Rude, no attention to detail, leave you after you order, don't fill drinks! I watched a woman get angry while she waited about 10min to even have the wait staff come around the corner to seat her while only 3 tables were full. Didn't realize the first time I came they only had pizza and the like here...when I asked if they had pasta I got attitude as if I should have known. I had 2 female waitresses and a male waiter the women were Bi***es! I should have left a ZERO tip! The male was much better and it looked to me the women were treating him with the same bi***y attitude! I hope your boss actually reads these reviews because your customer service sucks! Red headed pregnant female and long haired brunette!",

Waited 30 min to get seated while tables were empty, then waited another 20 min once seated to get water and our bottle of wine opened. Then 1/2 the food brought out 20 minutes later after our drinks served, and 20 min. after some food brought we got our last pizza which our guests watched us eat ours as they didn't want ours to get cold. Then the waitress cleared our table and waited another 20 min to get the check. Used to be our favorite place, now the waitresses that told us that tables were reserved and couldn't seat is there were resetting the same tables where guests never showed I suppose because they were still vacant when we left two hours later. The waitresses that seemed so stressed were not so stressed to stand and gab at the bar area without any concern to making sure things were flowing. Get over yourself Cucina Bella, I'm done with this place! BYOB or not, not worth it anymore. Pizza shouldn't take two hours and little attention to the clients.",

    "text": "First off let me say that the pizza and salad was good and I am pleased that they are doing so well and this property finally has a successful business. But if this is what diners think is wonderful it says little about the dining scene in the south hills.  When i went in to put in my name I was told that there would be a 40 minute wait.  I told the hostess that I was going out to speak with my friends and would let her know if we would be staying. She told me I wasn't allowed to leave the restaurant once i put my name on the list. I was only going out into the parking lot!!!   It was pleasant to be able to drink our wine while we waited and we were seated in a reasonable amount of time. We ordered a pizza  with mushrooms and artichoke hearts. As I stated the pizza was good.... nice crust but there was probably 6 slices of mushroom and possibly 1 quartered artichoke . Of the six slices 2 of them had no topping at all.  Our arugula salad was quite fresh, but consisted only of the greens, 4 cherry tomato halves and shavings of fresh parmesan (a nice touch).  When we asked for fresh ground pepper we were told that they didn't have it.  10 minutes later the waitress found it.  The thing that put me over the edge was when I was served my coffee in a styrofoam cup.  When I asked for a real cup I was told that they did not have any upstairs and would have to go downstairs to get one.  Our total bill with tip was $72 for one 6 cut pizza, three salads, one shared desert and corkage fee.... along with poor customer service.",

The crust on the pizza was too crispy for my taste, but the calzone was oversized and really good. Our server was cute and friendly but couldn't answer questions about the salad when we were ordering(said we would have to \"ask Carmen\".) We loved the Italian village decor and the fact that it was a BYOB, but menu was very limited (calzone choices were all the same ingredients except for a meatball, pepperoni or sausage; all had different names and expected diff ingredients.) We will return to use the remaining gift card balance we received and maybe our experience will impress us more but there are other choices that can match and out shine Cucina Bella.",

This past time was very underwhelming, which is definitely not the norm but enough to make me try to think of another option the next time I want to go out to dinner. We ordered the meatballs, the della casa salad, and the special feature which was a pasta dish. The meatballs were very good, the salad was just ok, and the pasta was pretty bad. For a place that doesn't typically have pasta on the menu I was excited to hear they had it as a feature. When the dish came out I was very disappointed to see that it was macaroni noodles, and the chicken in it was very clearly something that was bought from Giant Eagle pre-cooked, pre-packaged in strips from Tyson or another company. It was also $16 for this dish. I had really talked this restaurant up and my fiancee was surprised at how mediocre the food was for how much I had been raving about it prior. The service is always very friendly and again the meatballs were excellent but probably won't be returning here for awhile since the experience can be so hit or miss.",

At first I was a little hesitant because we had our 14 month old daughter with us, but everyone was very accommodating and warm. Service was friendly and attentive. We ordered the meatballs and fresca salad to start. The meatballs were served piping hot with soft, fresh bread and a bright, delicious red sauce. The arugula salad was very crisp and the balsamic vinaigrette was delicious. We then followed up with the Santa Lucia pizza with pistachio pesto and spicy sausage, which was absolutely divine. Seriously, some of the best pizza I've had in a long time, and I eat pizza on a fairly regular basis. The crust is thin and crisp, and is perfectly cooked throughout--doesn't get soggy in the middle. Everything was perfect for the three of us to share, and we left satisfied and without any guilt on price. An appetizer, soft drink, generously large salad, and pizza split between two adults and a toddler came to $45 and was plenty for dinner. We would have stayed for dessert if it hadn't been so close to bedtime. Can't wait to go back!  Just a note about the atmosphere as well: it can get pretty loud, but we weren't bothered because we have a small child.",

While my wife enjoyed her pannini, I found the calzone to be rather flavorless and there were large sections that were just dough.  The pizza was just as flavorless as the calzone but it did have a nice crust.  I thought the prices were on the high side for essentially a fancy pizza joint.

It was delicious. It  would have been a meal in itself. For dinner we ordered the Cucina Bella pizze, which was excellent as well.

We waited 25 min before the server came and took our order. No one got their food at the same time. Our food came out at 3 different times with 20 minutes in between each time. Server came to our table 2 different time and attempted to server food that was not even ours One persons Pizza was under cooked.. An 18 percent tip automatically added to our bill even though the service was bad. If you are paying 17 dollars for an individual size pizza and 10 dollars for a field green salad you should not get this kind of service.",

It has a great atmosphere both upstairs and downstairs. The pizza is terrific and fresh, the crust is always delicious. Our favorites are the margherita and the pizza anna (sans the red peppers and sub cherry tomatoes instead). The balsamic glaze on the Anna is out of this world good. The combination of flavors is top notch. BYOB is a nice feature, too. Usually too full to eat dessert but friends have and they've enjoyed it! We always seem to get the same server and she is terrific, super friendly. Will continue to keep coming back again and again. Easily the best pizza around.",

But the service doesn't match the food - we waited for a table (which we expected) then waited at the table for a server to acknowledge we were there. How long is too long? I think a server should stop by in the first 3-5 minutes after you sit down, even just to acknowledge that they see you and will be right back. Fifteen minutes after sitting down, we placed our order; the meatball appetizer came right away and was frankly, great.  The pizza? Also terrific, even if the waitress mixed up our pies and called them by the incorrect names - one piece in, we figured it out, and happily swapped.  So why am I being so picky? Cucina Bella has the prices of a high-end restaurant - for a few dollars more, I could have gone to Cure, where they not only feed you well, they treat you with care. No one was rude at Cucina, but I felt like the service lacked the attention - and attention to detail - I expect at these prices. I might go back, but pizza is a Pittsburgh staple, so Cucina Bella has a lot of competition in high and low places.",

There are definitely more tables crammed into the space than their web site shows in the photos.  The service was excellent with a menu limited to pizza, sandwiches, salads, and appetizers.  Everything served looked great on other tables.   The stuffed figs were delicious.  The cheese filing overwhelmed the taste of the figs, but the honey drizzled over was a nice touch.  The caprese salad was not quite as good as home made, but definitely better than most places.  The imported mozzarella seemed a bit old.  They smashed it down between the halved cherry tomatoes and it was a little too firm to be fresh.  Our pizzas came separately, and the ingredients tasted all fresh.  My only complaint was that they left almost 2 1/2\" of bare crust all the way around the 12\" pie.  I would have preferred the fixings to go all the way up to the edge, or at least within 1\" of it.  Having to eat that much dry crust was a waste, with nothing to dip it into in lieu of more fixins.  $16 for a pie should buy me a little more goodies.    It's BYOB and we brought our own wine.  Dinner for two pizzas, one salad, and one appetizer was over $70.  With too much empty crust and the really loud noise level, I'm only giving it 3 stars.",

The crust is very good and crispy, but the San Marzano sauce is flavorless, if they put any seasonings in it I'm a monkeys uncle.  Fortunately, I was able to get a blend of Italian seasonings from the waitress which was absolutely necessary.  The wonderful crust is ruined by the sauce which has no body and is like bland tomato sauce right out of the can.  The entire crust soon was a mushy mess.  My wife ordered the Santa Anna and even though its a white pizza, the improper use of goat cheese caused her pizza to be a mushy mess as well.  The waitress offered a dessert menu with no pricing, and when we inquired the waitress told us they ranged from $8.50 to $16.00, even she said they were overpriced.  Overpriced, that's an understatement.  Definitely not worth the price!!",

Arrived a bit after 8 and there were a few open tables mainly for 4+ people.  An employee says it will be a few minutes as we need to wait for a 2 top to open. At 8:35 we still were waiting and a 4 top in the corner was open so we asked if we could have that table.  They told us they would have to make a special exception.  That should have been our first sign of the experience.  Ordered meatballs and a pizza.  Meatballs came out fairly quickly which tells me they had them prepped for orders.  They were ok but not great like some of touted.   Then the wait......... for the pizza  45 min later we asked what happened with the pizza.  Mind you we were the last table to to be seated so other orders should have been coming out of the kitchen already.  10 more min go by and we call the server over again to say we either need our pizza or cxl it and remove it from the check.  6 more min later she returns with the pizza when we were ready to walk out and the excuse was that the other side of the restaurant was busy.  I would say the food quality is worth a pick up order but I won't waste my time on such slow and poor service again. Too many good places to eat that I want to try vs ones that could care less how they treat their guests. We did enjoy some of the pizza when we got home though.  Sorry Cucina Bella.

    "text": "Great Italian food tucked away in Bridgeville! Totally worth the drive from Pittsburgh. Delicious pizza and calzones, fresh salads, and it's BYOB. My husband and I usually split a salad and a pizza. It's more than enough food for two people. There are several creative pizza options, both with and without tomato sauce. This time we went with the Breasola, which has mozzarella and Gorgonzola cheese with thinly sliced steak on top. I usually don't like Gorgonzola cheese, but thought this pizza was really good. The Gorgonzola flavor blended in smoothly with the other cheeses and wasn't super strong. The steak was tender and flavorful and the crust was thin and crunchy, which I like. We had the Fresca salad with arugula and a delicious balsamic vinaigrette dressing.   The BYOB option is a lot of fun and makes it more affordable. There is a small corking fee. We have usually had good service, although this last time it was kind of hard to get the server's attention for refills and questions. They do only (I think?) valet parking, so bring cash for a tip. They only take reservations for parties of 6 or larger, but we haven't ever had to wait too long - this time we arrived at 6:30pm on a Saturday and were seated right away. I am a big fan.",

    "text": "So sad...we invited friends from the North Hills after bragging about this restaurant...their pizza is the best and the meatballs were incredible.  HOWEVER, last night was a very bad experience.  We ordered the meatballs, they were much smaller and over cooked.  In fact, they were crispy.  The sauce was still good as we had experienced in the past.  Next, came the pizza.  We ordered a favorite but when it came out, it was soggy in the middle and the toppings were sparse, unlike all of the other times.  Another friend ordered chicken on her salad but it was over-cooked and was like eating rubber.   Has something changed?    Oh by the way, our friends had the cheese plate which was fine but the calzone came out burnt and our friend only ate a piece.  When the server asked if he wanted a box, he said 'no'.  Surprised if he had only eaten a bite, that she would not have asked why.  We will go another time but hope this was an aberration and the regular cook was sick!",

    "text": "This place is a hidden gem! I live in the city but am always looking for an excuse to drive out to Bridgeville just to go here.   It's a cute quaint atmosphere. The restaurant is pretty small and they get pretty busy around dinner. They only take reservations for groups over 6, but I've never had to wait very long.   I've been here many times and my go to is one of the calzones. They all have meat in them but I'm a vegetarian and they're great about letting me make substitutions. The calzones are huge but delicious! Very high quality cheeses and ingredients. The dough is thin which keeps it from being too heavy. Delicious.   I've also tried their cheese plate and a few of their soups. They always have a soup of the day and it's always delicious. Most recently I had their vegetable and it was so flavorful!  I also love that it's BYOB. We always go with another couple and it's always a great time. So glad we found this place!",

Young people working to make some spending money or college savings. But always smiling and helpful.  Then we came for the calzone, oh my!  And then we came for the meatballs!! Better than my own which is the ultimate compliment.  Tonight we were back again after a few months; maybe since last fall, not sure. It was not good.  We waited inside the front door for about 10 minutes. It was not a busy night. Most tables were empty.  Finally greeted and brought to a table. I was glad I checked my chair because there was a piece of greasy food on it.  Three of four wine glasses were dirty or had lipstick on them. Two of four plates were still crusted with someone else's food. Really? The biggest let down were \"the meatballs \". Oversized from how they always were, which made them tough. The sauce was dark and over done and too thick. Even the bread served with the meatballs was not crispy! We saw the owner leaving when we pulled up. Hey!  Come back!  This is not how you want your reputation to go. Don't let your short legacy go. Be there. Check the plates. Wine glass. Meatballs!   We will be back. Best of luck!",

But the food was just okay and it seemed a bit overpriced. I got a margherita pizza and my husband got the lucca panini and they were nothing special. I think cucina bella wants to identify itself as a fancier establishment but I'm not sure if it's accomplishing that by serving mostly pizza, sandwiches and salads. Perhaps the fancier pizzas is where it's at so I'll have to try something more original next time.",

I was looking forward to try this place because so many people have been telling me how wonderful it was. We must have come on an \"off night\". When we arrived, we weren't sure what to expect wait wise because we had seen online that they don't take reservations for parties less than 6. They have complimentary valet but we didn't use it bc there was a spot right on the street. We walked in and to our surprise the hostess went to seat us right away. As we followed her, she suddenly turned around and stated that \" the table she thought was available had people sitting at it\". So we retreated back to the front & were told it would be about a 20 minute wait. That would have been fine except that hostess then disappeared and a new hostess began seating parties that came in after us, not realizing that we were waiting. So we had to bring that to her attention & were sat fairly soon after that. Our waitress came and greeted us quickly & took our drink order.  (They have ice teas bottled from Italy & they were delicious!) We ordered the meatball appetizer & 2 pizzas--The margherita pizza and the 4 formaggi. THEN THE WAIT STARTED. We waited approximately 25 minutes for our appetizer, which was a little longer than we expected but we chalked it up to being a Friday night & being made from scratch. When the appetizer did arrive, it was delicious. The meatballs & sauce were amazing! It was about this time we noticed people around us who had been seated well before we got there, were still waiting for their food. We heard several tables complaining about the wait & wondered how long ours would take. An hour later, still no pizza. Irritating but...Our waitress, Jessie was INCREDIBLE. We understood that she wasn't the one cooking the food so it most certainly wasn't her fault, but the tables around us did not seem to be as understanding. A lot of people were yelling & carrying on like it was her fault the kitchen was being slow. She handled herself fantastically, I don't know that I could've done the same under that kind of pressure. Once our pizza did arrive, it was BURNT. Now, I understand that brick oven pizza is usually more well done but this was beyond that. It was super disappointing. They did own up to their mistakes & comped the pizzas. Again, Jessie was awesome and told us this wasn't the norm & that she hoped we would give them another try, which I think we probably will. I just hope the owners know what a great employee that have in her to be able to make up for their shortcomings. I would definitely like to give them another chance & have the great experience I have heard about!",

The girl told us she could seat us outside.  It was less than 70 degrees out and silly us agreed to this.   Needless to say there were no heaters and we froze.  Additionally it was dark out and they didn't even provide a candle for the table so that we could see our food and drinks.  To top things off, the waitress seemed to have forgotten about us.  The food was decent but overpriced.  Needless to say we will not be returning there.   It was a very poor customer experience.",

It's not a huge restaurant so I recommend making a reservation first if you can. Our waitress was so nice and helpful. She told us the most popular menu items, what the restaurant is known for, and what she recommends. Everything looked so good so it took awhile for us to decide what we wanted to get.   As a starter we ordered the warm bread with dipping oil. The oil was a mix of olive oil with a bit of balsamic and Parmesan cheese. The bread was warm and fluffy and tasted amazing.   For our main dishes we ordered the arugula pizza and the chicken pesto pizza (one red and one white). The arugula pizza was topped with arugula, prosciutto, mozzarella, and truffle oil. It was very good. The chicken pesto was my favorite because I tend to like white pizzas better. It had tomatoes, chicken, pesto, feta, and mozzarella. Both pizzas came out fresh and tasted amazing.   They do not serve wine here, but you are able to bring your own bottle and they charge a small corkage fee.",

    "text": "My hubby and i went to Cucina Bella tonight for dinner at 5pm.  We were meeting another couple.  When we arrived the place was quite empty. The server was very attentive and gracious.   I had a calzone that had several ingredients including ricotta and meatballs.  ( I had read their meatballs were awesome).  It was large enough to take half home, and the meatballs were sliced in the calzone. My better half had spaghetti and meatballs.  He said the meatballs were good, but the serving size was not that big, considering they serve no salad or soup along with the pasta dishes.  You get bread and olive oil, but they have no butter.  We both thought his plate was drowned in  too much marinara sauce.  So flavor, good, portion and tomato sauce not so good.   The others had ravioli and penne with vodka sauce.  Both enjoyed their entrees.  The basic salad is $9, she ordered that which was large, but gee it was just greens and dressing?    Our server asked us about dessert.  She brought dessert menus.  There were 8 desserts on the menu ( none of which are shown on their website). She told us 4 of them were sold out.  Then when we ordered she said they were out of another one on the menu, and out of tiramisu, which is another one of their desserts.  So there were only 3 desserts to pick from!   We opted to skip dessert, there.  Another party of 4 came in.  The whole place was empty. Where do they seat them?  Right next to  us, making it very inconvenient for the other couple with us to leave their table. They also have only one handicapped parking space.  The parking lot is not huge, but I think at least 2 is feasible. Our server mentioned the menu is being updated.  Hopefully, so you can get butter with your bread if you want, and perhaps more desserts that are actually available on the Thursday evening.",

    "text": "I've been to Cucina Bella twice now, and I'll say that I'm pleased, not overly thrilled.  The first time I was there, I had a pizza. It was good, but got kind of blah as it cooled off.  But the service was good and quick.  This last time, I decided to try the vodka penne, and I was really surprised!  It was way better than I thought it was going to be, and if I'm not mistaken, the pasta was made fresh!  It was actually really good, and I'll go back just to have that again.  My friend had a salad and the meatballs both times we were there, and she also liked both.  The service has always been really good, and I like that it's BYOB.  The corking fee is only $5, which I think is cheap.  If I had to pick the place apart, they could stand to pay attention to water spots on wine glasses, table cloths would be nice, and it wouldn't kill them to NOT wait until 5:00 to start playing some music.  It's VERY quiet in there at 4 when we usually meet up.  All in all, we'll definitely be back multiple times in the future.",

Everything is fresh.  Service was good and professional.  The pizza is a thin crust that is crusty and tasty.  We were able to sit outside, seating we prefer since the inside is noisy. there is a nice list of deserts imported from Italy but we never seem to have room.",

    "text": "They have a lot of interesting pizza styles here with an even split of red and white sauces - we had one of each. The white was a little better although they were both fine. To me the cheese was a little lacking which is surprising. And personally I like my toppings chopped fine and blended in with the cheese while they have large chunk toppings sitting on top. These are just personal preferences, but what is not acceptable is sitting another couple directly next to us - at very close quarters to hear each other's conversations - when the entire restaurant was full of empty tables. What exactly did that accomplish?",

    "text": "The service was okay initially, then our waitress disappeared for a while before we ordered. She told us to put our menus on top of each other when we were ready to order. Which we did. We were the only people in the room at the time and we didn't see our waitress (or anyone else) for a while after that.   The food was decent. I got one of their many pizzas and Dad got their meatball calzone. My pizza wasn't great, but it was good. Was my pizza worth the $16 Dad paid for it? Not even remotely. The pizza at Blaze is better, faster, and just a tad over half the price for lots more toppings. I'm not against paying more for better food and service, but if you're not getting better food or service, I see no reason to bother.  I hadn't checked out the menu before dining there and was surprised that it's a pizza place. Since pizza wasn't invented by the Italians, it was surprising given the name even though one of the pictures scrolling on their website is of dough. I'd never seen warm bread with dipping sauce on a menu before. That was different.  Normally with BYOB, you are given glasses, they open the wine bottle, etc. and charge for that. The waitress did not touch either of our drinks other than to remove the bottle & can after we drank them and did not offer a frosted (or any other) glass for us to drink. However, there was a $6 charge on the bill.   The fine print of their website tells you that they're BYOB, though the first picture on their website when I went to it was all wine bottles, which implies that one could order wine. It's not like you're going to bring in a dozen wines to choose from if you're bringing your own. I included the picture of the wine bottles on their website (misleading) and a clip of exactly what it says about their BYOB policy - no fee is mentioned. We didn't see it on the menu either, but after the shocking bill, the waitress found it on the menu (after a while of looking and she works there) - it's listed in very fine print at the bottom of the menu after some info about how they add a huge tip for parties over a certain size and if you don't sign your tab (which is crazy, since a signature is only needed for those who contest the bill). The fee for BYOB is $5 per bottle of wine and $3 per beer can or other bottle (it only mentions beer, but clearly they charged for my drink even though it wasn't a beer).",

    "text": "I'm impressed.  Here's what I like:  - Table bread is warm.  It comes with balsamic and olive oil, but the balsamic is very thick, helping it cling to the bread.  (Don't eat too much before you entree arrives.)  - Salads are fresh and unique - not the basic \"bag of greens.\"  - Entrees are very good.  My pasta dish was very well flavored, the pasta was cooked correctly (not overdone), and everything was well balanced.  - We also ordered pizza, which was excellent.  It is a fairly simple pizza, with a fairly thin crust, tomato sauce that is \"tomatoey\" and not too sweet, and a decent amount of cheese.  - Service was professional.  - The setting is nice.  It's not a huge place, but there is more seating inside than I expected from the outside.  It's well decorated as well.  The only negative was some cooks in the kitchen speaking loudly (and dropping F-bombs...), with their sound pouring out into the dining area - not so cool.",

    "text": "Cucina Bella used to be one of my favorite pizza restaurants in the area with a great selection of other meals too. They have a wide variety of both red and white pizzas and they all have their own unique flavor, they still do! Unfortunately in the last 2 years, my 4 or 5 visits have me hesitant to give a higher rating & better review.   While their staff are all incredibly nice and friendly, you aren't always seen once seated in a timely manner. Also, sometimes I've waited almost an hour for a meal to come out during their slowest hours... I know they have takeout orders to prepare too but still... that's a long wait!... and when the pizza or meal in general comes out there has been something missing. This past visit, I ordered a margherita pizza but it came out (45 minutes later) with no basil, I would say that's a pretty important topping for that specific pizza. Our server did notice the mistake and brought some basil for 2 pizzas it was missing from. We definitely appreciated that she noticed and was on it right away, but for the wait time I expected to receive the correct order. During another visit there, (within the past year), our group ordered a couple pepe freso apps and 15 minutes later we were told they were out of peppers. I understand a shortage of ingredients but not the time it took to inform us about it.   I know how tasty the meals are when they come and that they use fresh ingredients for all their meals but recently some effort or attention to detail seems to be lacking somewhere in their process. I have been to this restaurant so many times over a 6 year period and have even recommended it to friends and family. But unfortunately more recently, there has been a noticeable difference in the overall service.  I'm hoping my past visits were just a fluke in their service or an off night for staff but I did want to give an honest review because my opinion has changed because of it.   If you do end up trying it out, just know it's BYOB... it is mentioned on the website but only in a small description that is easy to miss and there is cork fee, expected but not stated on website. 10/10 for past experience but 6/10 for any visits within the past 2 years.",
