Tons of cheese, a fair amount of grease (hey, I never said I was a health nut), spicy pepperoni, delicious sauce and even decent crust, which I never seem to be able to find anywhere.  A large pizza will run you about $10 and will feed three hungry people.  Delivery is lightning-fast, or you can stop in and grab your pie.  There's nowhere to sit, and I'm not sure whether they take credit cards, but the pizza is totally worth a trip to the ATM across the street in any case.",

I went to pick it up so I could check the place out and it was just a solid little pizza place(no seating) with friendly people. The pizza was very good, I highly recommend the sausage. The salad was not exceptional but solid.   Total bill came out to $17 even and with a free 2liter of coke. It's a great alternative to the delicious but pricey Murray Ave pizza shops.",

The place was tiny and charming with old pictures and articles on the walls - there's no room to sit - take out or delivery only. The price is right (paid $13.50) for a white pizza with ricotta cheese added and it was delicious. My only suggestion would be for them to carry a few more topping options (we asked for chicken but they didn't have it). Otherwise, a fantastic place for local pizza and we'll definitely order from there again.",

We ordered a large pizza with three toppings and an antipasto salad, and it was about 20 bucks.   Pros: Good tasting pizza - very friendly service - salad was very fresh and a good portion for only $4.50  Cons: Delivery took about 50 minutes (although it was Saturday night), very little sauce on the pizza - I would prefer a little more. The crust is pretty flavorless, but the rest of the pizza was delicious.   They told me I would get a free 2-liter with my order, and when they arrived the driver said he accidentally gave it to someone else - but I could just ask for it with my next order. Then he offered to help us move our furniture the next day! Really nice people!",

The menu is very small, however, if you do something well, why not stick to the basics? Sometimes the most unassuming places are the best!  Guy on the phone and guy who delivered were really nice. Quick delivery - 30 mins on a Friday night at dinner time!   The pizza: very good!!! The crust is crunchy yet chewy and has a nice flavor. Thinner in the middle and thicker toward the crust. Nice browning. The sauce is mild yet flavorful. Not spicy or sweet, just pleasant. Cheese: delicious and plenty of it! Tip: let your pizza cool or else your cheese might slide off!!! My only criticism is that there seems to be more cheese in the middle and not as much toward the crust. My husband got sausage and I got plain cheese - I usually don't like sausage but his was maybe one of the best I've ever had!!! My dad got peppers and onions and wasn't disappointed. We also ordered a chef salad - I don't think you could've fit one more thing in there - very good! We also got a free 2 liter of soda. All of this for like $35...not bad!   For us...we liked it way better than Rialto. A must try when in the area!",

We eventually got through though and food was ready within 15-20 minutes. The place itself feels like a tiny shack, almost like they're running it out of an alley. There is NO seating so it's take-out or delivery only. The workers were quite friendly though and seemed like bunch of old italian men.  Food: Our favorite part of the meal, surprisingly, was the meatball sub. Maybe one of the savoriest subs i've had in a long time with HUGE tender beefy meatballs drenched in a rich marina and served on a serious french loaf. The price seemed high at $7.50 but it can easily feed two people. Our pepperoni and mushroom pizza was good, nothing special and not gourmet but still tasty. Our crust still had a little crisp despite steaming in the box on the trip home and the sauce has a mild but savory marinara flavor. The best part of the pizza was definitely the hefty cheese layer which you actually had to bite through because it was so substantial. Pepperonis were mild but generous along with the mushrooms. The large can feed about 4 people.    This hole-in-the-wall place won't be winning any gourmet awards, there are no specialty ingredients or flashy combinations, but it may win you over with its down to earth charm. Definitely worth a try with the appropriate expectations.",

It was that hole-in-a-wall place you'd pass and not think twice about until you actually tasted it. The crust was crispy on the bottom yet chewy, the sauce was the perfect balance of tangy with a hint of sweet, and don't even get me started on the cheese. THE. BEST. PIZZA. I called to get my normal order about two weeks ago and was confused by the announcement that the number was out of service. Surely I had misdialed. I dialed again. I then drove to the shop because I was so confused. I figured maybe the guys decided to close early for the night; it happens. They were closed...permanently. I have never been this sad about an establishment closing. I crave this pizza often, and even more now since I know I can't have it. Goodbye, Conicella's.

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Saturday evening by myself to pick up a pizza for dinner. I don't know that I would have found Conicellas on my own but luckily some fellow elite Yelpers recommended them to me at one of our events.  I ended up calling Conicellas at around 7:00 and was told that my pizza would be ready in 20 minutes.  So I plugged the location in Google maps and off I went.  I am actually quite glad that I had the maps app too as Conicellas is a little further down Greenfield Avenue than I expected and right across from a church/school.  The outside of the place isn't much to look at and the inside consists of a small area to pick up your pizza and that's about it.  Whenever I arrived at 7:30, my XL cheese pizza was ready and I paid $12 cash and was out the door.  As with all pizzas, the pizza here can be broken down into its three major components: sauce, crust and cheese.  The sauce on Conicellas pizza didn't really have any spices in it that I could taste.  Don't confuse it with boring or bland though as the tomatoes brought a brightness to the pie and I enjoyed the slight acidity to them which helped to balance the cheese.  Speaking of the cheese, it had a nice flavor to it and there was an ton of it.  As a matter of a fact, the first piece that I tried to eat had half of it slide off because of its proportion to the thin crust.  Last but not least was the thin crust which I thought was fantastic.  It was super crispy and on the first two pieces that I ate I audibly crunched through each piece.  Then after it sat for a little while the center of the pie became less crunchy while the back was still nice and crisp.  It had a nice flavor too and I think I could taste a little yeastiness in the middle of the crust at the back of the pizza.  The bottom line for me is that I will head back to Conicellas again in the future.  As a matter of a fact I plan to take my wife in the near future as I am absolutely positive that sure will love this pizza, especially the crispy crust.",

We walked in and there was only one man working and he told us that they only accepted cash.  Since we did not have any cash on us we walked up the road to the atm and took out some cash.  We both ordered the small pizza and they were a good size.  The crust was fluffy and definitely could feed two people as long as you didn't have huge appetites.  My friend asked the man about the history of the place and he had said they've been in business over 30 years.  There are no tables and this place is completely takeout but we enjoyed this pizza.",

Good dough with a nice airy crust with a slight crisp, but a good chew.  Hoagies are solid as well - we had an Italian- ham, cap, salami and provolone.  Crusty/chewy sub roll (Breadworks?  Mancini's? Whatever - it's a good roll.  We had their $18 special - large 16\" cheese (we added X-cheese and sausage for $3), whole Italian hoagie, and 2-liter pop.  $22 with tax and the extra toppings.  Better quality than Rialto.  On par with Big Jim's. Good value and really friendly owners.  Cash only.",

Kind of bland, kind of greasy, not any better than any other pizza I've had in my life! We did get the white pizza -- maybe that was the problem?  The calzones, on the other hand, are AMAZING. Delicious perfection. Nice and greasy and with a good fillings-to-crust ratio (I don't like a lot of crust!).   The place itself has a cool hole-in-the-wall kind of vibe. There's nowhere to sit inside, but they do deliver. Oh, and they're cash only, but there's an ATM across the street.",

Hoagies are a little more basic, but their hot sausage and Italian have great flavor and generous amounts of cheese.  There is never a sense that they have skimped on their food.
