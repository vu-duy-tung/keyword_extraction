    "text": "A Saturday evening during March Madness. The food was very good. Burgers, MacNCheese, salads, etc. The service was somewhere between horrible and hilarious. Hardworking, courteous servers of various experience levels put in a very bad situation by the \"ownermanagercook\". Being seated we were told there would be an hour food wait after ordering. It was only 55 minutes though. There are maybe 20 tables in this restaurant, with 5-6 servers tending to them, desparately trying to apologize for the slowness of the kitchen and then later(9pm) for the running out of various menu items, some necessary to making a hamburger. I will mention again that the food tasted great and was beyond our expectations. But it may be the poorest run restaurant I've ever visited. It was actually entertainingly captivating. Kept wondering what twist was next or if we were on a reality candid camera show. Hope they fix things. The food was very good. Beer selection solid.",

The server we had Saturday afternoon gave great recommendations as well as knew the menu to answer any questions we had very quickly. The server Tara was also very attentive to our table as well as other tables as she worked the entire restaurant. For it being our first experience here ever I was beyond happy with our food and service. There is no kids menu but our server suggested chicken tenders or macaroni and cheese for our son. We ordered macaroni and cheese and our son loved it. We will definitely be back.",

Fried pretzels with tomato and jalapeno beer cheese are absolutely delicious and the pepperoni pan pizza, OMG, phenomenal!! We came back today for lunch and had the fried catfish sandwich and bacon cheeseburger. We were not disappointed. The smoked bean and potato salad sides are delicious. We'll definitely be coming back for more!!! The service was also fantastic which made our entire experience quite enjoyable!",

It took abput 20 minutes after sitting to finally order.  We went with another couple this evening, and each ordered an appetizer.  The first appetizer took 30 minutes and the waitress said \"the wings need another 5 minutes\".  15 minutes later (45 minutes after ordering - over an hour into being seated), we finally got our wings.  We were on our second wing when our meals arrived (well, all except my wife's pizza - that came out a few.minutes later, and the pepperoni and crust was burnt), which left absolutely no room on the table.  These restaurants first need to hire more staff, and second need to train their staff.  It shouldn't take over an hour and a half to finish your meal from the point you first sit down.",

They have high tables and chairs at the front of the restaurant and regular low tables in the rear. I was seated at the \"low\" tables.   I had a bacon cheeseburger with all the standard condiments.  The burger is not a frozen patty. Its a large burger on a large bun that I needed to cut in half in order to eat. You get 2 sides with the burger. I ordered fries and sweet slaw. The fries were crunchy and not greasy. The slaw was in a condiment cup. Not much to taste. The burger was cooked as I requested and it was very juicy.  Bacon was very tasty. I could not eat the last bite of the burger and left some fries. I was stuffed.  For me,  cost of the meal was in proportion with the amount of food that I received.  The staff is pleasant and very attentive. I will definitely return to the Junction.",

He ordered the hog wild burger with a side of beans (very small portion) and fries. The burger was okay, but not worth the price. I ordered the southwest chicken salad, and it was awful. The lettuce was soggy and the container was almost falling apart because of how soggy the salad was from the salsa. I threw it out and ordered from another place. I also ordered a side of onion rings for $8 and got home only to find that I did not receive them. I called, and the best they could do was give me a credit for free onion rings next time I visit by taking my name and phone number. I can't say I'll visit this place again based on the food and how overpriced it is for the quality. I've attached a picture of my soggy salad. Don't waste your time or money here.",

Everything I've had on the menu so far, (I've been there about 10 times,) is unique in some way, and not unique because they put kale or something stupid like that on a burger...  They have a smoker in the kitchen and many of the menu items, pulled pork, brisket, wings, pulled chicken are smoked. Everything is just awesome.  I can't say enough good things about this place.

(Note: you can order fries even though they are not listed as an option on the menu)  So far I've tried a burger and the chicken Parmesan sandwich. Both were excellent and a really good quality. The chicken parm had pepperoni on it and I personally judge a place based on their pepperoni. Barrel junction offers the small pepperoni that curls when cooked and collects all of the grease. What can I say, I like grease and this pepperoni is my favorite! The nachos and Bavarian pretzels are also delicious.   I like that they offer a weekly draft and cocktail and that they have a decent beer selection.   Route 8 definitely needed a place like this!",

Lite Beer, IPA'S, pumpkin flavores, porters, etc. There are several high top long tables in the front of the bar with numerous large TV'S for sporting events. The dining areas is in the back with garage doors when weather permits.   A group of us sat at one of the large pub tables in the front and ordered a few beers and later a pepperoni pizza. The pizza was cooked to perfection with fresh ingredients and flavorable crust. My wife who is a pizza connoisseur commented that it is her new favorite. The bartenders are very attentive and helpful if you have any questions on the menu or beer.   Great addition to the neighborhood and much needed in an area with not many options.

    "text": "Eeeehhh...it smelled like smoke? I dunno what to say. My bf and I stopped at Barrel Junction after visiting a buddy who lives out that way and when i walked in I was pretty excited to eat some BBQ. He ordered a pulled pork sandwich with fries and I got the brisket sandwich (no bun because I am a loser sometimes) with spicy coleslaw and baked beans. I really liked my sides!! The coleslaw was spicy which is great because all things should be spicy and wonderful. The baked beans also had a kick but were rich and tangy as well. My brisket was not bad but it was a little bit strange. The slices were super thin and I could not detect any existence of that beautiful pink ring you want to see with your BBQ. I don't know if I am correct in my thinking but I almost felt as if it were lunch meat. I mean...I ate the whole thing. But on the level of amazing barbecues of meals past, this was not one of them. I wouldn't mind going back but I most likely would not be the one to suggest it.",

Smoked beans were great and their version of sweet slaw was great.  My wife's pulled chicken sandwich was very good.  Great beer selection.  Our server Nadia was great. One negative was when they batter the shrimp they leave the tails on but cover them with batter.  If you batter tail-on shrimp you unbatter the tails before you fry them.  Or if you don't want to wipe off the batter on the tails PULL THEM OFF before you batter them.  Second negative was it was a little cool in the room which has large garage door like windows.  Which was okay until a server opened up one of the large doors letting in 55 degree air just to chill the room a little more.  I mean what the heck!!    All in all a good place with good basic food and I will go back and I won't let 2 little negatives turn me off to Barrel Junction.",

We came in for my mom's birthday and we had a decent amount of different food.  I ordered the fish sandwich which I really didn't think the sign outside would be correct in saying that it's the best, but it was incredible! And wayyyyy too big! The breading was perfect and it wasn't too greasy. I will say I tried all of the Cole slaws and none of them were good but that's minor. I also tried some wings and other then the garlic ones (which were not good) all the others were good.  I also highly recommend the sweet potato fries which were really good.   Our waitress was really nice and even though they were busy we didn't seem to wait too long for anything. Good addition to the area!",

Of course, my party was seated directly in front of the bar on a Saturday night. They also have another seating area off to the back that I'm assuming is quieter and less crowded.   Though they were busy, my party of 7 was seated within five minutes. People who came in the door after us didn't seem to have a wait time either.   Our waitress wasn't seen often. We saw other waitresses pass us more frequently than we saw our own. At one point we assumed she was on lunch or possibly finished her shift. She would often leave to get a drink or boxes for our food and wouldn't return for a while.   The food didn't take too long to arrive. When we got our food it was extremely hot. You could tell it was just prepared, which is good.   Overall, I enjoyed my experience here. The food was good and the wait time for things wasn't horrible. The overall service could be better.  On a side note, they have one of the best buffalo chicken dips I've even had.",

My husband ordered the Cajun burger which is described on the menu as having cheese, spicy slaw and onion straws on the sandwich. It arrived with cheese and lettuce.

My husband and I stopped on Valentine's day (one of the biggest restaurant days on the planet) and the scheduler decided that having only two servers for the entire restaurant was a splendid idea. We waited 45 minutes for our food to come out. Not too much attention from server. Not to be deterred, we tried again last night (Friday) and there was a hostess there taking names. We knew it would be about 20 min but asked anyway. She stated, without even looking up, \"20 or 30 min.  Maybe MORE, maybe LESS\". With a look of pure disgust, kind of like \" I don't give a #*%$ if you stay or not\". So, we decided on another restaurant that was happy to serve us. Hint to the hostess: CUSTOMERS = JOB SECURITY.  There are lots of other restaurants that we will patronize instead.",

The spicy slaw has a decent kick to it, so unless you can handle more than a 5 on a scale of 1-10, then beware. I loved it! The sandwich and fries were great as well. Good flavor on the chicken.   My boyfriend ordered the pan pizza with pepperoni and it is a large portion. We have to take more than half home.   We had a great server. She was friendly and attentive. We are looking forward to coming again!",

I had the brisket sandwich, fries & spicy slaw with a Raspberry Kiss to drink.(yum) My husband had the fish & shrimp basket (the shrimp were huge), fries, spicy slaw and a glass of blue moon. We can't wait to go back to try something else. We went on a Friday at 5:00pm",

First visit the service seemed a little disorganized for example we ordered a salad and they brought out 2 not knowing our server already brought it out but then we never received our kids food. By the time we were able to flag someone down our kids already ate half our meal. Worth trying out but wouldn't go out of my way.",
