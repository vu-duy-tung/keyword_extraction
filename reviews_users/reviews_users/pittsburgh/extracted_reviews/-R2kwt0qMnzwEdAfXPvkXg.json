We were concerned as we neared the location that the map might have been off as the building is set in a very unsuspecting location. The food was absolutely delicious! Both of our dishes were surprisingly spicy since they didn't ask about spice level when we ordered ahead by phone. We both like spicy food so it was perfect for us, but those who are sensitive to spicy foods might ask for their food to be mild. What a gem!",

We ordered Chana bhatura which was average in taste and flavor. Ambience is not great as well. The interior was too hot and crowded. The tables are very close to each other. Service is average as well. In Spite of these the food makes up for it. I recommend this place to all authentic SouthIndian food lovers.",

He said it would take ten mins. I waited ten mins and asked him where we can sit. The same waiter said it would take him ten mins to get a seat. After waiting 20 mins for a seat I finally got one. The waiter came and gave me a glass of water. I took a sip of the water and smelled something in the water. There seemed to be dish soap in the water. I was disgusted. The waiter came and took my order and it took him 1 hour to bring the food! Most of the food was burnt and he wouldn't let me take the food home! If you ever go here than please make sure to check your water and ask them to give you non-burnt food. Hope you  have a better time there than I did!",

You are here for the best Indian food you can get anywhere near Pittsburgh.  So cheap, so delicious, and so unforgettable your out-of-town friends will beg you to take them here when they visit.    We always start with the chili pakora--spicy, but so flavorful I don't mind a few moments of burning.  Try it!  Then get a dosa to share.  It doesn't matter which one you choose; just make sure you use the coconut chutney that comes with it.  Over many visits, we've tried almost every dish on the menu and can safely say that, even if you close your eyes and point randomly at an entree when ordering, you won't be disappointed.  Udipi's raita is fabulous.  Drizzle a bit of it on almost any dish to magically enhance what was in no need of enhancement in the first place.  And please indulge in the bhatura!    Do you remember those old cartoons in which characters would, literally, be lifted off their feet by a delicious aroma, carried through the air toward an irresistible feast?  That's how I feel every time I park in front of Udipi.  After your first visit, you will, too.",

One can smell the stink from the restrooms as one enters the restaurant. Yes, it literally stinks.  The place has poor hygiene standards and the food inspectors should really pay a visit here and place a hefty fine / shut down the place.   The vadas feel like they have been re-fried 10 times and are about 10 days old.  Dosas are full of soda bicarb and leave a horrible aftertaste. The potatoes inside were stale. The place is badly in need of renovation.   Orders are often messed up and the waiters are \"ruthless\" as they literally throw the food on the table. They are unclean. If you get a peep into the kitchen behind the cash counter, I assure you you will never reenter just as like we wont ever go back.   There are better Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh.

We're seated and given water and our own pitcher to refresh - this I loved (loved) because I'm a water hound.  The place is way bigger inside than it looks.  Two of us ordered the Udipi Deluxe and an order of curry.  We both thoroughly enjoyed the meal, which was way too much food for lunch - but we didn't love everything, so worked out fine.  A couple of the items we absolutely loved.  Here's the reason for 4 stars and not 5:  No one on the staff spoke English and we couldn't communicate well enough to get the names of the items that we really liked a lot.  So here's the result:  We would both go back - it really was that good.  Would like to try dinner and judging from lunch, there really is nothing that would be a big risk.  Definitely flavorful well prepared food.  So, if you've never been and would like to satisfy your vegetarian epicuri-osity there is no reason to hesitate!",

BELOW AVERAGE AMBIANCE It's like they did not even TRY to tidy up the place and give it a bit of a shine. Oh well.   GOOD FOOD People however come to Udipi because of the food. Mind you, it's not great south Indian food - I've had better. But it's very good, and perhaps worth the visit despite the comments above. I wish the delicacies were made in a healthier manner (better/ less oil etc). The prices are reasonable and that may be another reason people keep coming back. The location is also ideal for many south Asians who may be in the area because of the proximity to the beautiful temples.   Will Udipi ever improve their service and ambiance? I doubt it. They probably do not have a NEED to. I wish they did though. It's too bad.",

We were greeted blankly and seated in a booth. No background music. A worker sat in the corner booth with his cell phone up full blast watching what sounded like Indian music videos. It was a strange mix of random music and patches of awkward silence. We ordered our food. Both my husband and I thought it was decent, but we've had better in the 'burgh.

    "text": "Located in Monroeville, somewhere in the middle of Old William Penn Hwy, this place looks dilapidated and dated from outside (and also from inside). However do not let the appearances fool you, the food is delicious. You get delicacies from South India and North India, though I always return for the former (as I guess the place does that food more justice). Remember this is a PURE VEGETARIAN restaurant.   Now being an Indian and having tried authentic local food back home in India, I can say that the South Indian food they serve comes as close (in my opinion) to legit home-cooked, mouth-watering and tantalizing food that I crave.   This is how you can optimize your experience:  Start with the Idli- Vada combo, which includes a white cake made of rice batter and is steamed (idli), and a lentil based donut that is fried (vada). This is served with a coconut chutney and sambar (something like a vegetable stew).   Next proceed with Mixed Vegetable Pakoras - vegetables like onions, potatoes and chillies covered with a paste of gram flour and fried, served with a mint/coriander chutney. Accompany this with a glass of Mango Lassi or regular Lassi, as you please.  The next dish should be a Dosa (rice crepe) - Rava Masala, Mysore Masala, Spring Dosa, Paneer Dosa (here the Masala is a potato mixture that is filled inside the crepe and is not very spicy as the name actually suggests), or an Uttapam (thicker version of the Dosa) - Vegetable Uttapam.   Finish off with a Filter Coffee (made with a lot of milk and instant coffee).  Now, I do not guarantee you will be able to walk after this, but I do promise you will enjoy all that you just ate.  I bid you good eating!",

But once in, all thoughts of fleeing are instantly replaced by thoughts of how much more of this amazing food can I stuff into myself!!  Udipi cafe specializes in South Indian street food but they also serve several North Indian dishes ( pakoras, Chana batura etc). I usually stick with the dosas which are truly crisp & as close as u can get to eating the same dish in India. Of the dosas, I love the paneer & rava masala dosas.   A must try is the filter coffee!! A traditional hot drink from South India, this specialty instant coffee will be exactly what you need to round up your meal!",

    "text": "Udipi used to be our go to place for vegetarian food. My wife absolutely loves their butter paneer dosas. I like their idli sambhar and gobhi manchurian. Their north Indian food is good as well and I have tried chana bhatura, paneer curry, and parathas amongst other things. However, my last experience was horrendous. The owner seemed pissed at one of the employees and he was yelling around. Me and my family were waiting to be seated and he paid no regard to that. That was an unforgettable and unforgivable incident and we haven't been there since. Customer satisfaction apart, we come from India where we treat guests as Gods. But still there food is good and you should try it. As I said, I had been there dozen times before and didn't experience such a problem.",

    "text": "The first time I went to Udipi was about 8 months or so ago with my girlfriend and I was blown away by the food. It was the most authentic South Indian food I had tasted and I was excited to bring my mother over when she came for a visit later. The server was very accommodating and helpful and generally enhanced the experience. A few months later my girlfriend took her mother and some friends there and had a rather unpleasant experience with the service but the food was ok. I didn't think much of it at the time.  Recently when my parents were in town, we decided to give it a shot again. As some people have noted here, calling their phone number is a hit or miss and they don't even have a voicemail set up. When we actually got there and ordered our food and some drinks, we received no service. My dad had to go ask them for spare utensils and my parents were wholly unimpressed with the food and I had to agree. Their eggplant curry, a North Indian dish and okra curry, a southern variant both tasted identical. At least the okra curry had a few pieces of okra. The eggplant curry had peas but no eggplant. My mother, who hails from Kerala, a southern state in India, was not impressed with their South Indian Mysore Masala dosas. Our coffee, which was ordered with the food, never arrived and we had to have them take it off the bill at the end of the night. The place was definitely less busy than the last time I was there but somehow that made their service worse than better. Perhaps the place is under new management who are taking the place to new lows.   My first impression of this place was a \"hole in the wall\" restaurant with better food than expected. Now it is just a hole in the wall. I am going to warn my friends about the drop in quality of this place, including unfortunately, the friends who introduced me to this place.",

As soon as you enter, you get the feeling you have entered a south Indian restaurant located in India.   We ordered various dishes compising of idli, vada and dosas. The sambhar and chutney were authentic and I think I ended up having 2 dosas: mysore sada and the pav bhaji dosa. You develop an appetite within minutes of being here and the service is quick as well. To add to this, the owner/one at the counter was happy to direct us to places in and around Pitt.  One of the best south Indian I've had in US and a mandatory stop for all who've never tried/want to try/simply enjoy a south Indian delicacy.",

Thanks Yelp for the reminder! This place has more of a cafeteria setting and doesn't have the fanciest decor or furnishings. However, the place looks clean and the food ... very authentic and simply delicious. Also, the servers aren't the friendliest and you might have a hard time communicating with them since some of the server hardly spoke english. But we knew what we were ordering. And if you're like me - I usually gaze over what others are eating (which my gf hates) which may or may not help you order if you're unfamiliar with the dish.

If getting off the beaten path is not enough of an excuse for you, let me be the eleventh to tell you how great the food is: Udipi serves some of the best cuisine I've ever had the pleasure to taste. The samosas are near perfect and served with hari (green) and meethhi (tamarind) chutneys that must be blessed by Annapurna, as I can offer no other explanation as to why they were so much better than your typical Indian condiment offerings. Aloo Gobi and Baingan Bartha are two of my favorite dishes and though it is hard for me to stray, I am eager to try other things on the menu. I believe that Udipi takes great care in preparing food, as if it all should be fit for prasada . Eat like a deva but accept your fate of eternal samsara, as the kama of dining at Udipi will keep you coming back for more.   Notes on the service: The service was just as service should be -- just plain service. Our main server had a most pleasant smile. They leave a pitcher of water for you at the table, so that you may refill as needed (I like that). There were several children dining in the restaurant while we were there with whom the employees established very friendly rapport.   My apologies for any inaccurate allusions to Hinduism.",

Meals are prepared fairly quickly, so it is good for a hearty lunch during the week if you work or live in the area. Please note that there is a $15 minimum for credit card payments.

When I lived I Los Angeles we tried over 50 different restaurants and even went to India on a professional two week culinary tour of the country. So with this background and the glowing reviews that fellow yelpers and other culinary site's have given to Udipi we set off on with grand expectations for the food.  When we first entered the restaurant it was 80% full - all with Indian's and not a single Caucasian in the place - that's a very good sign in my book. During our whole meal only 3 other non-Indian people came in and they were all brought in by Indians. What can to go wrong we thought?  We ordered the assorted Appetizer plate, the idli was authentic and good and I like the sambar that was served it. The medhu vada was very plain and rather uninspiring it lacked any ginger, pepper, etc and was not good. We had Onion pakora and green bean pakora, their pakora batter was the most tasteless pakora batter I have ever had - also all of the fired items tasted like old grease that had been used to fry multiple different items so there was taste carry over.  The last but not least in the vegetable samosa which had a bland but unusually tough pastry. The inside was good and this had some flavor if you ate alone, however it was very greasy. Both the meethhi and hari chutney were very good.  For our entrees I had the onion masala dosai. The dosa was slightly undercooked so you could still taste the fermenting rice and urad. The potato filling was okay but needed more seasoning. We also had the aloo matar, a favorite of ours and an easy way to compare various Indian restaurants. While it was good, it again lacked the complex flavors and was generally under-spiced. To eat it alone was good, but if you pared it with rice the dish was pretty tasteless.  Don't get the idea that the food was bad, or inedible, it wasn't, however it was a very average for a style of cooking that is pretty easy to make very good. I will be in Pittsburgh for several months; hopefully this is not the best of the Burgh!",

As an omnivore with strongly carnivorous tendencies, I was skeptical at first (this was years ago), but I am a South Indian cuisine convert, thanks to Udipi.  The helpings are generous, the seasonings are well-balanced.    For appetizers, I enjoyed the chili pekora.  For the entree, the rava masala dosa was my calling.  (My mouth is watering just writing this...)  I seldom deviated from these items, despite my best intentions, so you can say that the sample size for this review is, ahem, embarrassingly big.

The dosas were great, I also remember the aloo gobi and palak paneer standing out, the samosas were huge, and the vegetable cutlet was another delicious highlight.  I can't think of one dish that we ordered that was not completely devoured, really.  Though this place is certainly humble, service is fine. The staff were very good sports about accommodating our large group, which was a bit ramshackle and gregarious.  We weren't even sure how many people were coming, and once we had all arrived, they helped us sit in a more comfortable place for a group our size, not seeming at all annoyed at having to deal with a large group.  We did go on a Monday evening, though, that was fairly quiet.  I agree regarding the affordability - our bill averaged out to $14 per person, including the tip, and that's after ordering many appetizers, desserts, etc in addition to the entrees.  I can't wait to go back!  If not for it being a little removed from the city, I think I would eat here all the time.  It's BYOB, FYI.",

But if you can find this wonderful gem, Udipi will leave your tummy satisfied and your taste buds stimulated. This is a very authentic no frills Southern Indian restaurant. The food is awesome! The first time I went, I liked it okay, but was not completely sold. Now that I've been back a few times, I am hooked. You have to find your meal here. I usually go with some friends, so we order a few things and go family style.   Here are our selections if you're daunted by the menu.  Appetizers: Vegetable Cutlet, Vegetable Somosas Dosa: go for the Masala Dosa if you're unsure Entrees: Palak Paneer, Alu Gobi Rice: Coconut Rice - it's awesome!  And go to town, and try other things. As the other reviews have said, this place is really a great bargain!",

Of course you don't go to this place for the decor. It's convenient for those who are going to temple. The service is also very friendly and helpful. If you aren't Indian, they will scale down how spicy hot is.   It is well worth the drive. Honestly if I could have Udipi every day, I could actually become a vegetarian.",

Please understand, even with GPS, this place is hard to find on your first try. We drove past it twice! The parking lot isn't very spacious and from the outside, things aren't very promising.  The interior is a step up from the parking lot. Things are clean, but it reminded me of a very compact, nursing home cafeteria. The staff is extremely friendly and very helpful. Our waiter's English was a little rough, but he worked very hard to convey the specialities of the house and make sure we were well cared for the entire meal. I honestly don't know what everything was named that we ordered; as we put our trust in the server's hands, but we had a VERY large puffy bread with spicy chickpeas, a thin crepe like bread filled with potatoes  and a cauliflower curry. Everything was delicious! We were pretty suprised at how good everything was actually. The better suprise occured when we recieved the check, less than $24 for three meals!!  With these prices, an extensive menu with quality food and great service, we'll be back. I only wish that the interior were a little nicer.",

Fried idli is a great appetizer, and the dosai come in many tasty varieties.  If you are not familiar with south Indian cuisine, you should take note that a \"masala\" dosa means the dosa is stuffed with curried potatoes and onions.  There's a lot to try, and I definitely recommend this place for repeat visits. The chhole bature is a noteworthy non-south Indian dish, it comes with a huge fried flatbread (the bature) and curried garbanzo beans (chhole).  It gets very busy in the summer due to traffic from the nearby S.V. Temple.",

    "text": "This has historically been my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. Unfortunately I eat a diet that isn't compatible with the carb-heavy S. Indian diet, but that doesn't change the fact that I will occasionally cheat and have a good meal here, and I will never stop praising it!  There is no 'atmosphere', unless you count the fact that it looks like your average restaurant in Chennai. It's clean, spartan diner booths, and up until a couple years ago didn't even use silverware (plastic forks and paper napkins in a cup at every table). But the food is what makes this restaurant amazing.  My favorite dish is the vegetable pullao, which is a mixture of rice and vegetables with spices served with raita. All of the dosas (big thin crepes) are wonderful, and it's difficult to choose a favorite-- you can't really go wrong. All of the chutneys are amazing, though the hari (green cilantro chutney) is the best in my opinion. The curries are good, too, but definitely not the strong point of the restaurant.  Udipi has some of the best appetizers around. The best thing to do is order the appetizer sampler and share it with someone-- the combination of samosas, onion pakora (like onion rings), potato pakora, chili pakora, etc. is deep fried heaven. The idli are a healthier option, and they're always cooked to perfection. Light and fluffy and filling.  The food is very cheap and high quality. The waitstaff might seem a little gruff at first, but they're all really great, friendly people whom I've gotten to know over the years. Be prepared to wait if you choose to go during peak hours on weekends, after temple or during Hindu holidays. During off hours, there is never a wait, but I have waited up to an hour for a table during peak times.   Make sure to check out the Indian goods import store, Shingar, next door for Bollywood films to rent or purchase, saris, beautiful jewelry and religious decor.",

I ordered the Chana Masala and it was bland and swimming in ghee. The naan was from a freezer. The salty lassi I ordered was 80% sea water, fat free yogurt and a straw. The chutney was from a jar. At many places I'd be fine with all of this; however, this is supposed to be the best? Either I tried on a really really off day, or the Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh must be the sub basement of Indian dining in America. This was a real let down. As for the service = Poor. We sat for nearly ten minutes before someone served us and when they did they made no effort to explain the specials, inquire if we wanted something beyond water and appeared to be disturbed to be waiting a table. Once we ordered the food did arrive promptly, but after we were both clearly done we sat waiting for someone to ask if we needed take out boxes. Finally, we had to wait for an additional ~minutes for our checks to arrive and they were wrong. Won't be back.",

I always get mysore masala dosa and I have never once regretted it.    The samosa is good, but don't order the other token north indian dishes, like spinach and paneer.  That's like going to a phenomenal sushi place and ordering general tao's chicken.  You'll be disappointed.  I hesitate when I read reviews that the food could be better or taking stars off for not serving meat.. That's like saying that matzah ball soup could be better by adding a little lard, or that lingua tacos would be better if they used filet mignon.

Why, you ask...b/c I'm South Indian and have grown up with South Indian food my entire life.  It's near impossible to get authentic South Indian food at most Indian places as most of them serve North Indian food (there is a distinction).  And while most if not all Indians agree, you don't get the best made South Indian food cooked by a North Indian and vice versa.   Although I will have to say that my mom makes the best South Indian food, Udipi comes a close second.  So I highly recommend this place to people who enjoys Indian food but wants to venture out of the standard North Indian cuisine (naan, chicken tikka, etc.).  The dosas and channa batura are delicious along with the medhu vada.  And as I mentioned earlier, it would be a crime to order North Indian dishes from this place so stick with their South Indian dishes and you can't go wrong.",

    "text": "I was taken by a friend. It isn't a very clean place- it's plastic utensils and melamine plates and plastic drinking glasses- and the waiter took us to the very back, when we requested a new seat- he tried to shove us back into the side crowded area-where the bathrooms are located,  with the other white people-   I finally just walked to one of the many open and empty booths in the main room and sat.    I ordered the palak paneer (spinach with fresh cheese).  My friend ordered the onion masala dosa.  His dish was about $7.50, mine about $8. I also ordered a standard mango lassi. It was standard.   A large crispy dosa was brought to my friend- with maybe- 2 tablespoons of filling 5 inches long in a 12 inch long dosa. He offered me a taste, as my dish hadn't arrived.   I took a very tiny bite- as there was almost nothing to bite there. A good 5 minutes or so later my dish arrived. My friends food had been  consumed by then.     Finally, a bowl of dark green spinach appeared. It had obviously been sitting in a warming tray for hours. And we ate at around 8PM. When one would presume a dinner crowd would expect somewhat fresh fare.    What cheese I could manage to fish out- was compact and hard, and obviously old.  I often make fresh paneer myself- I managed a vegetarian Indian restaurant some 25 years ago- I know what to expect. I've been cooking Indian food for 25 years.    I roast and grind my own blends of curries and garam masalas.    It was bitter- and unappetizing. That's what happens when heavily spiced dishes sit on warming trays for hours.  There was no rice. I reminded the waiter- no rice ever arrived. I also asked if I might have some chutney- or yogurt-    Anything to offset the blandness and monotony of a bowl of old spinach- god forbid I should ask for a $3 piece of bread- of course I got nothing.  The rice, which was supposed to come with the overpriced dinner- never did arrive.      It was a crappy cheap restaurant-  the food was way overpriced- and the quality was way under par.    I left feeling ripped off, and pissed off.   Oh, and still very hungry.",

    "text": "Food: Udipi is 100% vegetarian South Indian cuisine.  The menu is huge with plenty of appetizers, dosas, soups, entrees, and desserts to choose from.  We ordered the \"Royal appetizer platter\" which gives a sampling of all of their appetizers.  For $7 it was easily enough to feed 4 people and give everyone multiple tastes of each appetizer.  The dosas are huge.  We ordered one to share among two people as a second appetizer (we were hungry); one person at our table ordered one as his meal.  The entrees, again, are huge and delicious.  You can request how spicy you would like the meal made.  The baseline spiciness is very tame and shouldn't upset even the most sensitive palate.  Surprisingly, Udipi does not have naan or vindaloo on the menu, two of my favorites, but I am not very knowledgeable about the different regional cuisines of India, which may explain this.  It didn't matter remotely, however, as every meal was fantastic.  I highly recommend the Channa Batura, which the menu describes as a \"large puffy bread\" and it is in fact at least the size of a watermelon when it comes to your plate.  Luckily, for my waistline, it is mostly full of air and deflates, but was more than enough to eat for dinner and lunch the next day.  The menu offers unique Indian dishes that you will not find at most Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh.    Price: The prices are incredibly fair considering the quality and quantity of the food.  On a menu with 50+ items less than 5 were priced more than $10.  Most were in the $7-9 range.  Two of us shared an appetizer, dosa, two entrees, and two mango lassis for $39 with tip included.  Remarkable.  Drinks: BYOB.  There are non-alcoholic Indian drinks to choose from as well like the delicious mango lassi.  Atmosphere: Udipi seems to be in the middle of nowhere.  The address is Monroeville, but it is on Old William Penn Highway.  If you go at night, you drive through darkness and then a shining beacon of light appears, which is Udipi.  The interior is like a cafe/diner with booths and small tables.  The decor is very modest, which focuses all of the attention on the delicious food.  Service: The wait staff was prompt and friendly.  They answered all questions we had about the menu and were more than happy to make sure we got the exact dish we wanted.  The food and drinks came quickly, they spared us time to eat the appetizers prior to bringing the entrees, and the bill came quick.  (+): great food, great price, great service  (-): driving out to Monroeville to get there  Would I go back again? If I was in the area, I would no doubt go to Udipi as often as possible.  Living in the city, I'll drive out there occasionally for the incredible food.  If you're craving Indian, its worth the drive.",

    "text": "First off, Udipi isn't in the middle of nowhere.  It's on a somewhat isolated stretch of Old William Penn Highway, but for people from the city who think it's isolated, that comes from unfamiliarity with the area.  I'd imagine the location is GREAT for people going to and from the nearby SV Temple, for example. I live right up the hill from Udipi, and while my dad and sister have been there a few times, I hadn't until recently.  The food is very, very good, and it's a quiet, low-key kind of place during the week, with a steady stream of customers.  I've seen it quite busy on weekends.  I can't comment on the authenticity of the food, because I'm not Indian, but I really enjoyed everything that I had and I can't wait to get it again. It's a great value, better perhaps than India Garden, which I also like, but I feel like Udipi is the more homey of the two and definitely the best-kept-secret.  The waitstaff were also really nice and helpful.",

    "text": "This is one of those \"don't judge a book by its cover\" restaurants. Our friends suggested meeting here for dinner, and since we love Indian food, we were game for trying it. But when we first pulled up to the nondescript building located on a dark street in Monroeville, we thought maybe our friends hadn't actually invited us there for dinner, but instead to murder us and dump our bodies.  The inside of this place doesn't look much better than the outside. It is reminiscent of an 80's cafeteria and we were hit with a strong smell of cleaning chemicals when we first walked in. So needless to say, this did not appear like it would be a tasty eatery upon first impression.  But -- surprise -- it IS in fact a delicious restaurant! It's Southern Indian and all vegetarian. We ordered several dishes and ate family style.   We started with the appetizer sampler -- a huge platter of goodies, including a samosa, several kinds of pakodas (fried veggies -- onion, chili pepper), an onion-y donut-like thing (I forget what it was called), steamed lentil cakes, and several kinds of chutneys (coconut, cilantro and tamarind). I LOVED the samosa -- it probably was the best I've ever had. It was packed with tons of flavorful veggies, a crispy shell, and not too greasy. The pakodas were delectable, though to be fair, it's pretty easy to win me over with anything fried. I wasn't a huge fan of the lentil cakes -- they were a bit bland. The tastiness factor of the goodies was enhanced by the chutneys. I was partial to the cilantro chutney (it had a bit of a kick to it, which I love) and the coconut chutney (I could drink that stuff by the cupful!)  For our meals, we ordered two dosas (paper dosa and spring dosa) and two curries (aloo matar and another whose name is escaping me, but it had potatoes and little veggie balls). It was notable that they did not ask for a spice level for any of the dishes -- other Indian restaurants that I frequent let you choose how hot you'd like it. Because of this, the food in general was not as spicy as I would have preferred -- the dishes we ordered were definitely geared towards a tamer spice palette.  Lack of spiciness notwithstanding, everything we ordered was really delicious! My favorite was definitely the paper dosa. This was a burrito-type monstrosity with wrapping that is thin and crispy, kind of like a crepe. It was stuffed with a creamy potato and onion mixture, served with coconut chutney and sambar soup. The spring dosa was also yummy, consisting of a soft tortilla-like bread that housed a flavorful mixture of onions and other veggies. Our entree curries were outstanding as well. The aloo matar was a mix of potatoes and peas in a tomato-y curry sauce. It was slightly sweet, slightly acidic and very flavorful -- I was not shy about dousing the rice with tons of the curry sauce! The other entree was also quite delicious, with veggie balls and potatoes swimming in curry sauce with a flavor quite similar to that of the aloo matar.   The value here was stellar too -- we had more than enough food for the four of us (two dosas, two entrees, a huge appetizer platter, and two mango lassies to drink) and it only cost about $50 total. Overall, we loved our meal and will definitely be back, despite its dank location on murder lane.",

Well, as soon as you enter, there is that nice welcoming smell of food that reminds you of back home. They have a tad long menu and between the four of us that visited from Rochester, I can say we managed to taste at least 1/4 th of it and loved every bit. I wouldn't recommend a specific food dish here since everything is based off what the person wants to eat at the time, but the coffee/tea (heck! both!), you definitely need to have it once - I'd have them over Starbucks every time if it was here.   Lastly, I tried the falooda here (huge fan! force my mom to make it almost everyday I go visit India) - didn't quite like the taste here. There were some ingredients missing I think.   Overall, definitely a good place for authentic South Indian food if you have the taste buds for it.",

    "text": "Good restaurant not so great service. This is my second time here, and on both the occasions I have enjoyed my food. Pleased with the tasty food they serve here. Chana Baturra this time around was very delicious. The size of the Baturra just blew my mind away. You can tell they don't try to make it spicy or colorful but rather focus on the taste. My family ordered, Rava Masala Dosa and Tomato Onion Uttapam, which had a great consistency. The sambar and chutney was spicy and was brilliantly flavorful, I kept on ordering the refills on this. Wife tried the South Indian thali, which was my least favorite. The choices of vegetables and curries were not the best and the taste wasn't awesome either. They did provide a nice looking fully covered dish, which looked delicious to the eye.  The ambience is not so great, and is always busy as people visiting the SV temple quite often flock here for a quick snack or lunch. The service as I mentioned before wasn't the best. They took too much time to bring the food out initially. There were people waiting constantly at the door to be seated, which I m pretty sure didn't make their experience any pleasant.  If you visit the SV temple close by, do visit this place, even if it's for a quick snack. PS- it's a crime to miss their Filter coffee and Mango lassi.",

We had friends visiting from  NJ and my husband was really excited to take them here, as Udipi Cafe served authentic Indian food, and since 2 of my friends are Indian, would appreciate it and also help recommend what foods to order.   When one of my friends heard the name Udipi Cafe, he immediately told us it was a chain restaurant and that UC's food was not very good, mediocre to say the least.   We still went, and 3 of us ordered the Chana Bhatura, which was a large puffy bread served with chick peas curry garnished with onions. I thought the whole thing was very tasty and filling, the puffy bread is brought out as a fried pastry with air filled in it, like a soccer ball, and deflates within a couple of minutes. I also recommended my husband to try the paper masala dosa, since I had it the week before in NJ and it was delicious. The dosa was not as huge as the 3 ft long one I had in NJ, but my husband enjoyed very much as well. I thought the sambhar that was served with the dosa was a little too sweet though. The mango lassi was also very good, though I did not have it this time, my friend finished the whole drink within minutes, because it was so good, she couldn't stop drinking it.   Service was great, and our waiter was very nice. Will definitely be coming back to try their other stuff.",

    "text": "As others before me have said, the strength here is NOT the service. However, if you're in the mood to settle in for a while, put down your phone and chat with your dinner companions, and then \"ooh\" and \"aah\" over the most authentic South Indian food...you've come to the right place.  The place is great - they offer impressive portions, and this is alongside relatively cheap prices. Despite having the vibe that they might not take credit cards...they DO! Most every offering has a tasty coconut chutney and sambhar (lightly spiced lentil soup) that comes along side the main course. This is super traditional in South Indian cooking, so kudos for authenticity.   This is a great place for people with special diets. They offer many many many lentil and chickpea flour only dishes (again, very traditional for South Indian cooking). For the friend who is vegetarian or vegan but feels like they've exhausted Pittsburgh's offerings, this would be a pretty impressive date spot. The food is authentic, having recently returned from a trip to India, I can vouch for this. The heat profile is moderate, meaning you won't be crying, but you will feel the burn with some of their dishes. Likewise, if you are sensitive to heat, you can always stick with the plethora of tasty fried lentil dishes that come with mild coconut chutney.  The downsides are mostly those that others have voiced - the poor service (which also includes that the servers aren't great at explaining dishes to you if you don't already know what you are ordering), and the iffy ambiance. I actually wasn't a giant fan of the spicing on some dishes (not the heat, the actual use of salt and spices). My concern was that they sometimes were blander than I'd hoped. Now, I will say, when you order Idli (lentil pancake), expect a gluten free version of very spongy wonder bread. This is traditional, but I was kind of unimpressed with the dish. If you soak it in coconut chutney and sambhar, though, it's pretty good.  I'll certainly be back, because the flavors are great, and there's nowhere else in the area to get this kind of food. If they just improved and tweaked some of their problem areas, this place would be a total destination.",

After the difficulty navigating the lot and brusque service, the food made it well worth it.

We have come here 3 times now and the staff has been great. They have been nothing but pleasant and accommodating.  Everything we have ordered has been delicious. We've tried multiple dosas, uthapam, aloo gobi, and the deluxe thali. Highly recommend.",

Generally, once you are seated, the waiter will take your order.  Make sure you eat with your hands (after you wash them, of course, because that's how dosas should be eaten).  When finished, we just pay at the cashier. I've always left full and satisfied.",

We were a group of 4 from different parts of the country, and all of us unanimously agreed, the only reason this place thrives is because they are only Indian restaurant in the vicinity of the Sri Venkateswara temple in Monroeville.

The South Indian special is also outstanding.  My goal is to one day be able to finish an entire thali.  Overall, good service (particularly for an Indian restaurant) and completely worth the twenty-minute drive to Monroeville.  Eating at Udipi helps me to understand why the vegetables are so good you don't miss the meat.  Also, good water service, which is nice considering the spice levels are not oriented to the American palate.   Indian restaurants are places where it's so comforting to have subcontinental natives outnumber Americans.  Udipi Cafe delivers.",

Udipi gets it right, which was a pleasant surprise.  As others have indicated, you don't go to Udipi for the service or decor. Be prepared to have to flag someone down to take your order (perhaps a couple times) till you get the right person.  The dosas and uttapam are delicious. I've enjoyed the various curries I've tried as well. And the coconut chutney that is served with the dosas is my favorite.  One my most recent visit, we came at a time when the restaurant was full and some larger groups than ours were waiting for a table longer, but our group of 3 only had to wait ~5 minutes. The food came pretty quickly after we ordered, everything was tasty and relatively well-priced, so overall I would recommend.",

I was sick for three days after. Obviously you can see why I'd stay away....  Fast forward years later and I had a taste of some pretty good Indian in SF and figured I'd venture back in with an Indian food expert.  So Serena R was kind enough to take me to her fav spot in the Burgh.  Monroeville is definitely not my ideal destination spot in Pgh, but for good food, I'll travel anywhere!  I had Serena suggest a couple things and settled on the Vada for an app.  These are tiny fried donut holes with chutney and sambar sauces.  This was a great first nibble!  I ordered the Butter Marsala Dosa because I love the potato mixture inside!  I thought that was delish, although being a supersize American I would have loved more taters, but i definitely enjoyed the portion I had!    We also ordered the Channa Batura, which is a huge puff of rice dough with a chick pea mix.  I'm sorry I'm totally not being correct with my Indian food descriptions, but this was probably my favorite dish.  I really loved the doughy rice and the chick pea mix to dip it in.  The dough part is HUGE, and we didn't finish it all.  I took it home with the chick peas.  I know I probably won't eat much of the dough, but I'm definitely finishing the chick peas!  I would absolutely come back and try something else new.  The menu is huge, so you could take a while discovering your favorite dish!  And everyone is right, you don't mind it being vegetarian only, since everything tasted so great, you don't miss the meat!",

This place, so I'm told, is one of the most authentic Indian restaurants in the city.  They have a very exhaustive menu. I have tried the samosas, gobi dry, masala dosai, partha, vegetable korma, channa masala, palak paneer, and aloo palak. Both times I went here we ate family style and I really think that is the right way to do it. The dishes could potentially fill one person but I think it is better to order an average of 3 dinners for every two people in your party. This allows you to try more delicious foods and who doesn't love leftovers.   My absolute favorite dish was the palak paneer. We ordered this because our server said it was his favorite dish and man I can understand why. It is super creamy but hard to explain. It will make you wish you had more. My next favorite dish was the aloo palak. For appetizers I insist you try to gobi dry. It is technically cauliflower, but you would never know. The only dish I wouldn't order again is the samosa's. They were good but I have had better from my Indian friends.   I am not friends with the owner but I hope to be some day because this place is wonderful!",

Udipi's strength clearly lies in its carbier offerings, as the dosas, uthappams, and bhaturas were enjoyed by all, with the SAMBHAR and COCONUT CHUTNEY as flavorful accompaniments.  Some crispy dough, some creamy filling, plus a savory sweet dip make for a perfect bite.  The paneer filling didn't sing like I would have hoped--the flavor fell flat and it was a strange texture that was more mushy than anything else, but wrapped inside its dosa shell, it was perfect tasty anyway.  The thali was the biggest miss for me.  I honestly couldn't assign every dish to its name, but the only ones I really enjoyed were the RASAM and a sticky rice garnished with dried fruit.  The rasam was so wonderfully spiced and aromatic, I committed to another side order, and the sticky rice was toothsome and fragrant.  The PORIYAL was tasty enough, as was the ubiquitious SAMBHAR, but I mostly left the rest of the savory dishes and the PICKLES, as well as the PAYASAM, which I had been excited to try as I love milky desserts, but just didn't care for the flavoring of.  I like soft breads, so the CHAPATI and the PAPADUM just weren't my thing, and Udipi's versions were no exceptions.  The chais tasted sinfully creamy, almost too much so to sip, and my tiny cup was gone in minutes.  It would be great if they would offer refills, as the cups are so small for their price.  I enjoyed the creamy coffee as well, though it was a bit too indulgent for my black coffee-loving husband.  In total, our Saturday lunch was an adventurous and flavorful meal and well worth the trek as first-timers, though I ultimately much prefer the aloo gobis and korma dishes that I find much more satisfying.  I wish I had ordered a quart of the rasam to go, as I likely won't be back.",

    "text": "This place is definitely a hole in the wall.  The outside and inside are rather drab, but everyone there was Indian, so that seemed a good sign. I ordered takeout over the phone, which was a bit frustrating. There was a lot of background noise and it was hard to understand the guy on the other end. I ordered something I saw on their yelp menu, but I was told that wasn't on the menu and to order something else.  No matter what I asked, the only response was \"What do you want to order?\" Since they don't have a website, I just had to pick something common that most restaurants have: paneer tikka Masala and paneer dosas. I had to ask how long it would take to be ready; the guy said 30 minutes and hung up. Although I was told rice was included with the tikka masala, none made it into my to-go bag, which was disappointing, since it's really not a full meal without rice. The flavor was great though, with some wonderful spice. And the dosas were fantastic and came with delicious chutneys. The chai tea had a distinctive flavor I hadn't encountered before, which I'm guessing cones from the brand of tea - it was dark and almost bitter. I got a paper menu, so I can study it ahead of time and order more adventurous items next time I'm in town on business. Although the experience wasn't stellar, the food was really good and I basically want to try everything on the menu.   I should mention this is a vegetarian restaurant, so if you're craving meat, I'd go elsewhere.",

After that, I've went in between 3-5pm. Service was much faster obviously because there was less customers. Food is pretty descent. I would give 3.5 stars but rounded up!",

It's apparently an old and popular establishment for authentic vegetarian South Indian food. The idli (steamed rice cake) and vada (fried lentil savory donuts) are pretty good and come with a side of coconut chutney and spicy sambhar. The dosas (rice and lentil batter crepes) are really good as well. Also, worth trying is their dahi vada, although on the sweeter side, it is still flavorful. The service is decent, but can be slow if the restaurant is full. Come for the food and you won't be disappointed.",

It is something that I cannot recreate at home. If I don't get that, I will get a dosa. Their dosas are very fresh and long. My friends had gotten the thali and enjoyed the variety of it.

This has always been my rule of thumb when it comes to ethnic food...trust the ethnic people! This restaurant is pretty casual and spacious. It looks more like a family diner. The service was super friendly and accommodating. They kept checking up on our party to make sure we were enjoying our food.   The menu was straightforward and all the cuisines are clearly explained. This is a vegetarian restaurant, so all of the dishes are vegetarian. Since I came with a large party, I had the opportunity to try a little bit of everything. I don't remember the exact names, but everything I tried was delicious, from the dosa to the rice dishes. Even though this place is vegetarian, I think non-vegetarians will still really enjoy the food because of the well-blended flavors. For those unable to handle a little heat, be careful what you order because some dishes are naturally spicy. If there's \"spicy\" in the name, it is most likely really spicy.   Overall, I highly recommend Udipi to all the vegetarian and Indian food lovers out there. It's a bit out of the way, but worth the drive. The food was well executed and quite authentic.",

Well I finally made it out to Monroeville with some friends, and let me tell you, Udipi did not disappoint. We ordered the fried vegetables (not greasy), aloo gobi (curried potatoes), dal makhani (curried lentils), tomato and pea uthappam (like a pancake with veggies cooked in), a spring dosa (veggies), and a masala dosa (potatoes). Personally, I am not a fan of dosa, but I would definitely go back for the uthappam. Nobody missed having meat in their dishes. Nothing was too spicy that it couldn't be enjoyed, especially with a sip of mango lassi. You guys, my sweat literally smelled like curry for two days after eating here--Udipi is the real deal!",

    "text": "Makes other Indian restaurants look bad. Every dish is so flavorful and *epic*. The paneer seems like it was freshly churned - nothing like the excessively chewy varieties I've had elsewhere. It's hard for me to order anything besides the matar paneer - so flavorful and a huge plus that it comes with raita- but others' dishes have been equally amazing. The chana masala is a crowd favorite. Definitely try the poori - delicious fried bread the size of my head that is a perfect accompaniment! Reheats well too.",

They give you plenty of food, and it won't kill your wallet.  We've been in town for one week and eaten there 3 times already, with plans to go back.  It's addictive!  Lots of Vegan options!  The place is somewhat of a dive, but it's clean enough for the workers to eat there, so I'm good with that.  Very Nice staff, helpful for those that aren't familiar with indian cuisine. Lots of loud conversation and foreign languages mixing with pleasant indian music.  Even though the atmosphere isn't top notch, it's a neat little cubby of culture, and I would recommend it to anyone, ESPECIALLY VEGANs!",

    "text": "We stopped at Udipi while travelling back from Cincinatti. It's rather off the beaten path at the start of the boonies. NOT where you'd expect to find an Indian restaurant (nor the store next door).  First off, Udipi is purely vegetarian.  Which I can respect. There food was very good and they offered a number of dishes that are not common at most other Indian restaurants.  We ordered Nav Ratan Korma as it's a vegetarian dish that I always find to be very flavorful. We ordered a couple of appetizers, including fried cheese, bread balls of some sort - both of which came with a vegetable stew which was quite flavorful.  We also ordered several types of bread, Naan, chappati, and poori. (Poori is a puffed bread and my daughter absolutely loved it. She called it pasta bread. I didn't understand why my 4 yr old daughter called it that and when I asked she explained \"Cause it smells like pasta daddy. You're so silly.\" Sure enough, I smelled the bread and it did have a scent reminiscent of pasta.)  The biggest surprise was the Dosa. And I would say this is a MUST ORDER ITEM.  We ordered one of the dosas which came with a potato and onion filling inside a crispy crepe like bread.  We were expecting something akin to a burrito. What they brought out was HUGE.  Udipi gets 4 stars. I am a meat lover, so the lack of meat prevents this restaurant from scoring higher.",

    "text": "This is, hands down, the best Indian restaurant in the 'burgh. Udipi is  Southern Indian, so the food is spicy. I've probably had everything on the menu, but the masala dosa will always be my favorite. Dosa (or dosai) are made with finely ground rice flour, which is made into a crepe and stuffed with various fillings. The masala dosa at Udipi is filled with a mixture of spiced mashed potatoes and onion, and served with sambar and coconut chutney. Delicious.  More standout dishes include the vegetable cutlets, which are veggies ground up and formed into a patty and then fried...I know it sounds strange, but these are wonderful. For entrees I like the channa masala, vegetable korma and baigan bartha, but, truly, anything I've eaten here I've enjoyed. If you can stand the heat, order the rasam soup as a starter; this rivals chicken soup as a cure for the common cold. Udipi is 100% vegetarian, but you carnivores and omnivores won't miss the meat, as the flavors are so outstanding here. Try the pickle to really challenge your Western palate.",

    "text": "Whoa.  Seriously.  Whoa!  This place is hands down my favorite Indian place of all time in the U.S.!  They make Southern Indian, which means dosas, utapams, idli, sambar, rasam and so much more.  This is usually the first place I visit when I land in Pittsburgh.  Going there is effectively a ritual and a delicious ceremony.  I inevitably end up ordering a gluttonous amount suitable for 2-3 people and every time the waiter looks at me questioningly with his eyes silently asking me if I know what I'm doing as he jots down my order on his worn notepad.  This place has my favorite dining aesthetic of all: old and worn cafeteria design with no frills tables and chairs, a few weathered posters of Indian gods and goddesses, a self serve pitcher of water at every table and home cooking arriving on a timely basis to your table that will quite frankly knock your socks off.  I get the special rava masala dosa which is a feat to behold, and a passion to devour.   This is Southern Indian cuisine at it's finest and for that Udipi is always worth the trip out to Monroeville, 15 minutes outside of Pittsburgh, which I otherwise almost definitely would never have heard of or visited.",

I feel weird, like I'm missing something - I love Indian food and Udipi does it well, but for 5-stars I want a place to knock my freakin' socks off with regularity.  Udipi makes great food every time, and the Paneer Makhani DOES knock my socks off, but I guess I'm just a picky Yelper.  I think my problem is that I haven't tried the dosas or the other South Indian fare yet.  I'm guessing that ordering channa masala, palak paneer, bhindi masala, and channa palak is cheating and missing out on the full Udipi experience.  Fine, next time I'll get a dosa.  But we've enjoyed everything we tried - despite the channa masala not being my favorite - I think the paneer dishes are especially good.  The Paneer Makhani isn't on the takeout menu for some reason, but it's on the dine-in menu and they know what it is, so ask for it when you call!",

This is its selling point: I'm definitely glad Udipi is there, because you wouldn't get those dishes elsewhere.  And some of them are really interesting!   But interesting is sort of where it stopped for me.  I didn't have anything where I was blown away by the flavor.  I believe it took us a long time to get served, too.  The decor is sort of dated-looking.  That's not a big deal, though... we were there for the food.  Udipi could be better.",

This was off to a great start.  We sat down at a basic brown table and with Udipi's sparse decorations and dim decor we felt like we were in a cafeteria. But nonetheless the place was hopping. As we had no clue what to order, I had look to Serena R for recommendations and we ordered everything she suggested, not knowing what we had gotten ourselves into:  Mango Lassi Milkshakes Medhu Vada Masala Dosai Chana Batura  Everything was tasty and man a bit more spicy then I expected but delicious. The Medhu Vada (donut) was deceivingly very filling given its size. I do like the soup that accompanied though not sure how I feel about the coconut pudding. I think since there were two of us we could have just ordered the Masala Dosai or Chana Batura but I'm glad we ordered both for this tasting. We kept seeing orders of these two items coming out of the kitchen frequently. Thanks to Serena R I will be back to Udipi for some Southern Indian food again.",

    "text": "While in the Monroeville area (near Pittsburgh), I decided to use Yelp to find the most popular local restaurant in the Monroeville area.  This search led me to the slightly out of the way Udipi Cafe.  I have never been to an all-vegetarian restaurant before and per the menu, this place serves \"pure South Indian vegetarian cuisine\".  While having enjoyed many an Indian dish, w/ meat mind you, I decided to listen to all the strong Yelp reviews and try this place.    Atmosphere - Simple, Booths, Linoleum, Paneling, Clean, Mom & Pop feel.  Food - I ordered from the lunch menu and went with a curry.  I ordered the Aloo Gobi (potatoes & cauliflower cooked with Indian spices).  This came with a side of jasmine rice and chapathy (to me seemed like plain naan....see my photo and judge for yourself).  When the dish arrived, it was nicely presented with an accompaniment of yogurt that consisted of diced cucumbers, carrots, and celery.  I also received a little dish that contained Indian spices to include as desired.  These spices added some great flavor to the meal.  To wash all this deliciousness down, I ordered water and something I have had before, Lassi (a yogurt drink).  This Lassi however was mango flavored, which made it even tastier.    Service - Helpful, cheerful, prompt, and patient with a novice.   Price - $7.50 Combo, Mango Lassi $3.50 over all not too bad .  Overall - A great experience even if I would not mind adding some nice lamb to my Aloo Gobi...I am just saying...",

    "text": "After hearing rave reviews from several different sources we decided that we needed to check out. Udipi.  We randomly decided one night to check it out.  As we pulled up, the parking lot was packed!  Most of the tables inside were filled as well.  Obviously lots of people really enjoy this restaurant.     We sat down and ordered some drinks and took a look at the menu.  We did no preparation before we came here and I kind of wish we had.  The service and educational aspect left us kind of disappointed.  We have dined at Abay and Tana before and had great help from servers on what to order, since obviously we were not at all familiar with their cuisine.  I had hoped for the same here.  Maybe some of our issue was a language barrier, maybe a new server.  Not entirely sure, but as we asked for some assistance on the menu, he essentially pointed at a page and encouraged us to pick something from the list of 20 entrees.     I do think we actually did an ok job of ordering.  We started with the appetizer sampler which came with numerous different types of fried foods and dipping sauces.  Again, we had no idea what anything was.  Our plate arrived and we were stumped on what we were eating and which dipping sauces were for which food items.  They did taste good though.     I ordered the combination platter, which came with rice in the middle and a whole bunch of toppings rotating around the bowl.  It did taste very good, although I was not sure how to eat everything (Do we pour it overtop the rice, do we put the rice into each individual side, do we not need rice for some of them?)  My wife ordered the eggplant curry and enjoyed here dish very much.  We also ordered a bread that came out sizzling.  It had the consistency similar to a fried phyllo dough.  I went well with the the chutney. Overall, the food we ate was very good and very unique.  I was disappointed with the service we received.  I'm sure if we were dining with someone who knew more about the food that the experience would have been much different.",

We ordered too much food for us to finish .. I guess our eyes were bigger than our bellies. Give it a go. We came from out of town and were staying in a local hotel. This was a great choice.",

If anyone knows udipi cuisine, they would know how good is the Sambhar with its sweet notes. But the Sambhar was way too sweet. And the Avial was like the Thai green curry and it was OK. The only good part was the Dosa and Uthappam. Dining in this restaurant basically a YMMV experience.",

The dosa are amazing and you can't go wrong with the masala dosa or spring dosa. The sambar is also perfectly spicy and the coconut chutney is cooling. I recommend ordering a mango lassi if you get something spicy because you will need it! Their desserts are also really great and I recommend the gulab jamun. Their appetizers are great especially their gobi manchurian which is fried perfectly. I could eat a whole plate by myself!

    "text": "Udipi Cafe is one of my favorite Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh, but they still don't deserve a five star rating. Let me explain why.   Udipi is a pure vegetarian restaurant and I have  been to Udipi a few times. The food is fantastic. They would definitely get five stars for that. One of my favorite items is the mirchi Bhajji (chili pakoda). As a warning to fellow spicy food lovers, They're extremely hot. Their dosas are also amazing. The spicy andhra Dosa, rava Dosa, and mysore Dosa are my favorites. All dosas come in a masala version as well, which contain mashed potatoes inside the Dosa. I've tried their north Indian dishes as well, but they're not as good as the south indian ones. There are other places where north Indian food is better. South Indian food is udipi's forte.   Price wise it's fantastic as well. Each of these dosas cost less than $10, but is a full meal. The appetizers are in the zone of $5.   The ambience is not so great. The bright white light inside doesn't help. The seating area is fairly cramped. There are a few booths with couches, but the chairs otherwise are not very comfortable. Service is very unlike other restaurants. There is no dedicated server for one table. Different waitstaff took our order, gave water glasses, gave the appetizers, and each of the main course dishes. We had to ask for water repeatedly before someone gave us some.  This place gets full score for the food, but is below par for service and ambience.",

    "text": "Udipi is a great hidden gem off of 376 in Monroeville! I have been here a few times and love the traditional foods that they serve.   I've visited several different Indian restaurants and this is by far one of my favorites. While the restaurant my not look like much from the outside, the food they serve is delicious. The Malai Kofta is my absolute favorite. It's sweet yet savory and is served with a side of rice. The portions are very large and I always have leftovers to take home for the next day (or meal!) They also have AMAZING coffee!  The service can be hit or miss. While everyone there is very welcoming and friendly, they do not hover or check in frequently. I personally don't mind this as I enjoy only having someone come by every so often, but others find this to be off putting. Definitely recommend if you are looking to try a new Indian restaurant.",

I was impressed with how fast they got it all ready (10 minutes). The spring dosa sounded good on paper, but tasted quite bland in real life. The masala dosa was tasty. I must also add that the masala dosa was absolutely gigantic (exactly what I was hoping for). I had to cut it up into many pieces to eat. The palak paneer was on par with every other palak paneer I've had. I had Udipi Cafe bookmarked for a while now, but sadly I didn't find it to be that great.

We ordered poori, a deep-fried whole grain bread, and they were airy, light, crispy, with just the right amount of decadent richness.  My mango lassi was perfect--not too sweet, but full of yummy mango flavor. It was a perfect accompaniment to the spicy meal. My husband had the baingan bartha and said it was the best he's ever tasted.  There's a reason Pittsburghers make this trek again and again!",

I've had chana masala and a dosa here. The chana masala was watery and flavorless. The dosa was on the border of unpalatable, as it had a plethora of uncooked onion shards slathered throughout.  Based on the food alone, this place deserves one and a half stars. However, I'm giving it two stars, because the prices are reasonable and the portions are commendable. Plus it's all vegetarian, which is a thumbs up in my book.   In sum, if you're interested in supporting an all vegetarian establishment, give this place a go. But, if you're just looking for a decent meal, pass this place up. There are better options in Pittsburgh proper, so save your gas for more worthy culinary adventures...",

The only thing this restaurant can improve on would be service.  Frankly, the service during my visit was typical of service in other Indian restaurants: very curt interactions with restaurant workers who are simply there to take your order and put the food on your table.  Just embrace it for what it is.  Also, this place literally is a hole in the wall.  Don't come here expecting a fancy place.  Come here expecting great South Indian food that you typically won't find at your run of the mill Indian restaurant in town.  Oh, and come for lunch as opposed to dinner.  The value is tremendous.",

I am giving this place full stars despite the fact that the layout and decor are awful, and feel like a cafeteria, and the staff is almost without exception unfriendly and refuses to make eye contact.  You pretty much have to trip a waiter to get your drink refilled.  I don't even care, though.  The food is heaven.  It's nirvana on a plate.  It's spicy and authentic and delicious, and I overeat every time I go there.  They have a really large menu with a wide variety (something often missing in vegetarian restaurants), and I always have a crisis of indecision when I go there, because I know that it's pretty much impossible to go wrong.

We ordered a few items instead of each ordering entrees, so we could sample their different offerings. Our waitress was very helpful with suggesting items for us to try, as well as explaining what we would be getting.  The service was outstanding, and they frequently checked on us to make sure we had everything we needed. Prices were incredible for the amount of food given!   My favorite times so far are the Gobi Manchurian (dry option), the Chana bhatura, and the vegetable tempura (like onion rings). I also LOVED the Pachadi Raita (spiced yogurt with cut vegetables) as a dip, as well as the lemon pickle- very tangy and yummy.   I was so impressed, that I came back the very next evening for dinner because there were more items I wanted to try! :)  This is definitely well-respected within the South Asian community, as it was filled to capacity both nights with lots of happy customers! (FYI - This is also located very close to the popular Sri Venkateswara Temple for those who are coming from out of town.)  I will definitely be back. Maybe again tonight! Haha.",

Now for what you've been waiting for, the food!! My personal favorite is the Aloo Gobi, and Dosa (any Dosa). Their Dosa's are stuff you only dream about, but they are real here. So fresh and the chutney is delicious. I could go on, but please stop reading my review and eat here you will not regret it!   Tips: if you aren't familiar with the location you will miss it! Go slow and be careful when you pull into the lot, because you can scrape the undercarriage of your car when you pull in, the building is a little nondescript so you will need to keep an eye out.

We started out with the Idli and the \"idli fry\", which I had never had before, but it's exactly what it sounds like, fried idli. I personally preferred the regular idli. For my main, I had the Masala Dosa, which I very much enjoyed. I particularly liked the coconut chutney served with it.  The main downside is the service. Our food came out very fast, but the servers were not very friendly and forgot to bring out coffee we ordered (though they brought it immediately when we reminded them)  The place is a little bit in the middle of nowhere, unless you came to the nearby temple. I'm not sure it's worth a special trip out here, but definitely a good option if you're in the area",

The last time my dad was here, he also got very bad food poisoning (separate occasions and different dishes). This does not make me eager to go back. I don't think they are handling food properly. Sometimes the dishes come out lukewarm instead of hot. If you're going, please enjoy. But also please be advised!!",

This is one of our go-tos for takeout, when things are busy or I just need a night off for cooking. We have our favorite dishes but here and there mix it up, especially if we are eating with friends and ordering more dishes.  We started with an order of samosas. These are my boyfriends favorite. They are a crispy fried dumpling and filled with potatoes, peas, and spices. They come with a tamarind sauce, which is so good and always gets finished. The other sauce is an herb sauce with some kick to it. I actually use the extra to make salad dressing sometimes.  Next we got an order of Chana palak. It's a mixture of chickpeas and spinach which is delicious and addictive. This dish isn't spicy but it is really flavorful.  Finally we got an order of aloo gobi. It's a mixture of chunks of potato and cauliflower. The sauce it comes in has a little bit of a kick (though this time a little more than usual). The sauce is creamy and so good. Just pour the sauce all over your rice.  In general I love Indian food. Udipi isn't anything fancy or unique. What it is though is delicious vegetarian Indian food. I love grabbing takeout because it's quick and convenient. Takeout is usually ready in 15-20 minutes.",

One of my favorite things is their yoghurt. I usually ask for a side of it to go. I use it to make my own yoghurt at home. It tastes better than many of my other yoghurt cultures.

I have been coming here for 20 years and have lived in / visited most major cities in the US - this is the best South Indian restaurant I have ever eaten at in this country. Don't order the North Indian food or expect to be disappointed (notable exception being the chole batura). That's like ordering chicken fingers at a Michelin star restaurant.   Every time I come here, I order the chili pakora appetizer with the Udipi special. With this, get the rasam, vada, Mysore masala dosa, and tea. The spice from the chili pakora compounds with the complex flavors in the rasam, providing an unparalleled taste experience. The main courses are highly authentic and the tea is an excellent conclusion to the meal. The only meal that should be ordered here, IMO.  If you are looking for your typical chicken tikka masala / palak paneer and naan, this is not the place. Most customers are indian and know exactly what to order and what to expect. As other reviewers have mentioned, this is not the place to expect a great ambience and service. Come here for simple, clean South Indian and leave stuffed. Ultimately, their business model is such that they simply don't care if you aren't happy with the food and service. The customer base is mostly regulars which drives a pretty consistent revenue for them. Come here to experience True, authentic South Indian food.",

The waiters were very rude. They brought our food, and never once checked back to see if everything was ok, or if we needed anything. However, we noticed their attentiveness to all the surrounding tables. We sat and waited for our check for quite some time, it was as if we were invisible. The people next to us (who came in after we did) got their food, ate, had coffee, got their check and were out the door and we were still sitting there trying to get a waiters attention.

I have been here a few times and it always makes me feel as if I'm in an authentic South Indian restaurant in Bangalore.  They are usually crowded on weekends so the service can be slow at times but the food makes up for the service. You cannot go wrong with anything you order here. Our usually menu consists of a vegetarian sampler that has an idli, a medu vada, a vegetable cutlet, a samosa, a couple of onion rings and a couple of mirchi bajjis. I don't remember a time when we were here and we did not order the sampler. It comes with a whole bunch of chutneys and a bowl of sambar.  Next comes the main course which usually comprises of choley bhatoore or fried rice or any paneer dish. The portions are pretty big so you might need to take some of the food home with you.  The filter coffee is something you won't get everywhere in the US and is a must have.  I know I'll come here many more times",

They should really learn how to treat their customers with a bit of respect and not be rude to them. I give them 1/10.  Hygiene/Ambience: It's not a very hygienic place and the ambience is very noisy. I'd give a 4/10.  Price: Its a moderately priced place, for about $15-20 you can have a very satisfying meal. I give it 7/10 for price.  I have had some bad experiences here, but I really love the food. I really hope they can improve on the customer service and hygiene.",

This reminds me of going to my hometown pizza shop - except they serve really awesome Indian food. All vegetarian - just in case you didn't know. I read several reviews about the service not being great - have to say our waiter was very helpful and patient. Good service. I also didn't mind the casual atmosphere - I don't need fancy to enjoy good food. Really nice experience. I won't get into our order simply because - as I said - we're just not very familiar with it.

    "text": "I was enjoying the pleasant smell of this place when i initially walked in. The place was only half seated for a friday night. 80% of the people where indian so i figured this would be an authentic indian place. The seating and decorations were very old fashioned and I didn't much enjoy sitting with the cleaning equipment and used trays behind me.   We ordered the appetizer platter to start which was  a very large portion for only two people to share. I guess my eyes were bigger than my stomach. I didn't much like that everything was breaded and not like the thin crispy coating but it was very thick. All the batter was so thick that i could barely taste the vegetables underneath all the breading. One item was nothing but bread or maybe a potato of sorts. It tasted ok but it was just too thick.  For our entrees i ordered the dosa stuffed with potato and onions, my hubby ordered the masala made of cheese and a red sauce. I didn't like the masala because it tasted like foreign spaghetti sauce. The cheese flavor was a little too strong for me. I did however love the dosa. The bread was thin and soft like a crepe and very very large, Larger than the entire plate. I found that interesting that they made them so big. I wasn't sure how to eat it so i just tore off pieces of dosa and made small burrito like pieces with the potato and onions. They cam with alot of different sauces but they were very watered down. I had a white curry sauce, a green one and something that tasted like spicy tomato and vegetable soup. The soup mixture was probably my favorite. I ate it directly from the tin dish as if it were soup. They also had my favorite Tamarind sauce which was very yummy but a bit too thick.   My only suggestion would be to update the decorations and dinnerware. I wasn't too thrilled with the idea of eating in a place that serves there food on cafeteria dishes. Other than that this place was not too bad. I will probably return to try a different dish and hopefully have a better result with my appetizer selection. Also, i didn't realize that this is a vegetarian spot so no lamb or chicken vindaloo :(",

    "text": "Udipi is located on an old auto trail off the beaten path in Monroeville. Situated only one mile away from a Hindu temple, this restaurant attracts a large Indian clientele, which is generally a good sign for South Asian food.   The exterior and decor is unremarkable and dated, but the parking lot is always full, so you shouldn't let the exterior discourage you.   The service is polite, and basically you're seated, your order is taken, and you're left alone to eat until you're offered a tea or coffee after you're finished stuffing your face - so the service may be interpreted as curt by conventional North American standards.  The food, which tastes great, is vegetarian friendly and the portions are generous. If you venture here and are at a loss for what to order, I'd highly recommend getting a Thali and enjoying the variety. The tea they serve here, which I think is flavored with cardamon, is also quite nice.  Udipi is the type of place that lets its South Indian food speak for itself.",

But it's in a particularly obscure area of Pittsburgh (who would thought there'd be a restaurant of any type on this stretch of road). And it was 3/4 empty on a Sunday evening at 6:30 pm.  The extensive menu is packed with Indian food like you've probably never experienced. Fortunately, there were three of us and we were able to try a variety of dishes. This is vegetarian food and it's spectacular - clean and distinct flavors and interesting condiments.  The service was plain. As someone else said, they take and deliver your order, and then leave you alone. We didn't notice the interior much (our eyes were in the menu), but it seemed pretty ordinary.   We ate a lot of great food for $36, including tip. What's not to like?",

Food: Excellent selection of tasty dishes, not just the predictable ones.  We weren't asked for preferred spiciness.

The meat-eaters didn't seem to care/notice that meat wasn't on the menu.  WARNING: Parking became tight (understatement) as we were trying to leave.  And I have no idea why, but there were a bunch of stupid little kids outside.

I ordered the chickpea curry with poori bread.  It was $6.99 which was a bit on the pricey side since it was a bowl of chick peas and a bowl of rice.  Price aside, it was pretty tasty and I had a great time slopping up the chick peas and rice with the puffy bread.  The last time i went i ordered the lunch special which came with 8 small cups filled with a variety of sauces and other items like chick peas and lentils.  This is a nice way to sample different ingredients on one plate.  Not only does Udipi provide excellent food but the unique experience makes it a special destination.   As a side note, the service isn't going to win any awards but really do we ever ask \"where can we go to get great service?\"",

    "text": "As a vegetarian, I was very favorably impressed with the food when I visited Udipi in July 2009 with my family.  Udipi was the first restaurant I visited when I returned to Pgh in April 2012,  On this visit I was by myself on a Saturday evening.  The place was busy, but I was seated quickly.  The decor is very sparse and the lighting is glaringly bright.  My order was taken, and my food came within a reasonable time.  It was the South Indian Thali platter (small portions of several items).  The food was OK, but not fantastic.  The platter includes a cup of tea, which never was delivered to my table.  And although I kept waving at servers walking past, none ever stopped.  After finishing my meal, I walked to the front desk, and was presented a bill for the full amount.  I told the cashier that I had not received my tea and could an adjustment be made?  \"How about we give you tea in a to-go cup?\"  I accepted that, paid and left, thinking that I would not be returning - ever.  Disclaimer: I am spoiled, living in Los Angeles County where many Indian and other vegan and vegetarian restaurants exist.  If I still lived in Penn Hills, where I grew up, I may make an allowance because of the relative scarcity of vegetarian restaurants in this area.  Udipi has an abundance of Indian customers, and my never returning won't make a difference in their long term success; but I want people to know of my experience of eating a meal without the cup of tea that the menu says is included.",

The outside of the building is not very pretty and its location next to a quarry on the side of a highway road is rather odd. However the food is all fresh and excellent quality their dosa are comparable to the ones I've had in India itself. I've probably had everything off of their menu though I'm partial to the Royal udipi dinner which comes with several items including dosa sambar vada and tea. The best dosa is the spring Dosa which is filled with cabbage curry instead of the regular potato curry. Don't be deterred by the outside!",

    "text": "Five for the food, knock off two for the service, and one more for the ambience. After all this time and success, they owe their customers more.   Normally I don't rate service over food quality, but this couldn't pass. We hadn't been there for a while, and decided to go for Easter dinner.  It is not easy for us, as we need to park someplace close to the door. The Udipi Cafe was perfect. We arrived early so we could park close by.  We had read the service could be surly and slow, but this was out of control.  I asked myself if I had ever had such unprofessional service in my long career of restaurant attendance? Nope. not even close.    Greeted by a growly man I'll call Moe Howard, the place was virtually empty. So of course we were seated in a booth next to the service area for the wait staff.  He showed up early, and assuming we were ready, let us know he was ready to take our order. Yikes. Caught off guard, I responded with a no more gruffly than I had planned. Well that was it.    He refused to return, sitting not far away and playing intently with his cell phone. Finally another, kinder man came by and took our order.  Then we waited.  People arriving after us came in, ordered, were served, ate, and left.  We would have left if there was another place close by.    Finally the same kindly man noticed again, and went to the cashier area. He then spoke with Moe, waving a ticket and then went into the kitchen. I assumed Moe had never turned our order into the kitchen.  By now an hour had passed.   When our food finally arrived, again delivered by the kindly man, I asked what had happened. Being very polite, he told me that they had run out of chickpeas.  Really?  The Udipi Cafe ran out of chickpeas?    The food was fine, but the dinner had a different taste....tough getting past the bad taste in my mouth from the service.   Of course we won't be back. Too afraid.  Won't take the chance. Moe will be happy.  That's a shame, as I have recommended it often, taken international students there for dinner, and enjoyed the food.  But professionalism counts too, and the Cafe can't afford to ignore it.",

The dosas are crisp and the batter authentic and delicious and the sambar is quite literally the best I've had in America. We've literally eaten here twice in one weekend because its that good, and I even know family that makes it a point to drive through Pittsburgh when traveling from distant places such as Detroit because they love this place so much.   Some other great items to order are chola bhatura and vada. The mango lassi is also on point.  The service is not always incredible, they take a little longer than average sometimes and can be a little rude on rare occasion but the food is so good that I still give it 5 stars.   One thing to be aware of that it is in a strange location and looks like shack more than a restaurant, with a long, windy road leading up to it but trust me, it's worth it.   If you're anywhere in this area or even remotely hungry/like Indian food - GO!",

My tongue craves for that authentic taste here in the U.S.  Remember that moment that Anton Ego has in the movie Ratatouille, where he's reminded of his childhood on his first bite of the ratatouille? I had the same moment when I ate the food at Udipi Cafe. I didn't drop a pen, I shed a tear.  Very rarely do restaurants do that to me: take me to a different place. And I'm glad I could feel that moment at Udipi Cafe.  I want to be rational however, and I'm not giving it the five stars because the ambiance isn't the greatest. Some brighter lights and spaced out seating can fix that though. Personally, I could eat on the sidewalk if the food is great, and I know that Udipi Cafe's food is right up there.",

Although the management feels compelled to offer some Northern Indian dishes, STAY AWAY!  Those dishes are average at best, and might even offend folks from Northern India.  I'm a gringo, but I went with a bunch of friends from both Northern and Southern India, so there were educated, critical pallets at the table.   The restaurant was very busy, and almost everyone in there was either a native of India or first generation American.  In my mind, that's evidence of good things to come.  The dishes were all delicious - we ate a wide range of the Southern Indian offerings.  A couple of the members of our group did order Northern Indian fare, so we did get to find out how mediocre it was.  GO THERE!  Eat Southern Indian cuisine and feel fortunate that such excellent cuisine is available in the Pittsburgh area!  I'm keen to go back, as well as to get my fill of good Northern Indian cuisine at The People's Restaurant, also in Pittsburgh.    It's all good . . .",

We came here for the vegan options, of which there were many, and the servers were knowledgeable about all the dishes. We got a veggie appetizer sampler plate and it included a few things I had never tried before, all very tasty. Our main dishes were also good, channa masala and malai kofta (for the non-vegans in the group). I can't say it was exceptional relative to other restaurants I've been to, but was all fine. They are also very kid-friendly. The servers comfortably chatted and even played a little with my kids.",

The food was decent, but the service was horrible. It took them forever to take our order. My daughter's food was not served until all of us had already eaten. We had to wait about 20 minutes for dessert, and it was not served till we had already gathered our things to leave.  We tried to point out the poor service to the manager and he responded very disdainfully that the restaurant was busy, and there was no apology for poor service.  We have been to plenty of restaurants that are busier and hold their staff accountable for providing quality.  Once again- disappointed.",

According to me this is the only Indian style restaurant in Pittsburgh worthy of any praise.  I was completely impressed with their product and that is what counts the most.  I love the variety of chutney's, sauces and menu items in general.  I know it's not completely healthy, but I do love fried vegetarian food.  The dosas are absolutely lovely.  Udipi is a great place to take a date because the food is so shareable.     The big mistake that most people would make is to pre-jugde this place by the divey, dinery, type of environment.  Despite the old, bland look of the establishment the food is full of flavor, and color.  The other thing that I didn't think about is that the food is not overly spicey and we didn't give them a numeric spice level.  The is best service is the kind that goes unnoticed so that you can just sit back and enjoy the food.  There was not alot of communication, but I still felt like they did their best to take care of our needs.  Love, love, love!    * Cautionary note - Be aware that sometimes it is difficult to reach them by phone.  This is typical, but doesn't mean that they are not open.",

I wasn't happy with our service, I had it confirmed with my friend who had went to the temple and stopped here for lunch.

We ordered the battered hot peppers as an appetizer, and it came with incredible dipping sauces. They were perfectly fried; not greasy. Super spicy. We knew we were in for the real deal right off the bat.  I ordered a creamy paneer yellow curry dish as my main meal, while the bf got channa masala. It was the BEST Indian food we have ever had.  We dream about this place. The service was incredible, and there were more Indian friends in the restaurant than anyone else. We knew that was also a good sign. Who better to know the food than the friends that have eaten this beautiful food for the majority of their lives?  I seriously can't wait until we go back. We spent around 55 bucks, but we ate like royalty. Way more than we normally would. We just couldn't stop. It was crazy.  Please, if you love Indian food, treat yourself. You have got to go here. Yes, it is kind of out of the way, but you will be really happy that you made the journey there, trust me.",

The food was mind blowing, authentic. The service (or slight lack thereof) was also authentic. And the prices were great. So no surprise, I asked my friend that we have to come back here the next time I was in town, and that we did.   There is nothing on the menu I wouldn't recommend, basically you can have anything you want and it will be authentic, so it's more up to what you'd like to have in your dosas and whatnot. Keep in mind this is a vegetarian place. The chana batura is one of their highlights because it comes as this GIANT puffed thing and is really fun to photograph. I got the spring dosa which was promptly inhaled. If you are able to make the trip out here, I definitely recommend it!",

    "text": "Excellent vegetarian South Indian food in Pittsburgh.  Not the best South Indian I've ever had. For that I would suggest that you travel to New York and eat at Saravana Bhavan on Lexington Avenue.  If you are in Monroeville/Pittsburgh area though, Udipi can't be beat. We ordered the rasam soup, the appetizer plate, Mysore rava masala dosa and the mixed vegetable uttappam. Since I have a rule not to order North Indian fare in South Indian restaurants (and vice versa), I requested the server to substitute the samosa on the appetizer plate with something else, and he suggested the bonda.  The appetizer platter was HUGE. The idli, vada and bondas were excellent. The pakodas were alright, but hubby loved the fact that they had whole chilli pepper pakodas. The chutneys (green cilantro-sour, brown tamarind-sweet, coconut-savory) were all fresh and really, really good.  The dosa was decent, a near-perfect 8 out of 10 on the thinness-and-crispness scale. The onion-potato stuffing was good.  The sambar, very sambar-ey-salty, sour, hot.  Rasam soup- good, but hard to distinguish from the sambar.  We had to ask them to bag the uttappam for us, which they did with a smile. We had it for breakfast next morning, and it was perfect.  In all, Udipi is up there on my list of South Indian restaurants. They do have quite a bit of North Indian fare on the menu too, though I can't comment on that. Diner-room ambience, restrooms are bare but clean. We would definitely go there again.",

At first, when you enter the Udipi Cafe, you can see a bunch of  Indian people eating, families & friends.  For me , it's a real good  sign, a \"seal\" of authentic cuisine.  Then, when you try the food, you'll understand.   the only difference with \"real India\" is that, at Udipi Cafe, you CAN drink the water.  Real flavors, real food, very good food and all  for a very affordable price.    it's a no brainer: just  GO!   I'll be back  ASAP",

I think my favorite is the paper masala dosa, but the special rava is a close second. I also LOVE their rasmaiai - cardamom/pistachio flavored milky goodness. If you don't like cardamom, I'd give this one a miss as the flavor is pretty strong. The idli is also top notch.   I'd say this is one of Pittsburgh's hidden gems. Not to be missed!",
