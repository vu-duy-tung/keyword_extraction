    "text": "We had a good visit here last week. Like many others have noted, the pancakes are unique and very good. I loved the buttery flavor and crispy edges. I would have preferred fresh-cut strawberries in my pancakes instead of the syrupy ones. We ordered a fruit bowl for our one year old daughter but it seemed a little overpriced for what it was. The bacon was very thin - I like a thicker cut myself.   This is an unusual location as it's found inside a pharmacy. The employees were pleasant to deal with. Can't say it was my favorite breakfast ever but it was certainly worth the stop. This is a cash-only joint, so bring your dollars!",

    "text": "Pamela's is incredibly delicious. Those crepe style pancakes melt on your tongue and despite them being so thin, they are very filling. If you eat a Pamela's breakfast, be prepared not to eat anything else that day. The potatoes are crazy good, made with onions and magic and who knows what else, but they taste like heaven. Wish I had that recipe! If you are from Pittsburgh, I'm guessing you could sing Pamela's praises. If you are visiting Pittsburgh, this is THE place to have breakfast/brunch. Yes, they have a lunch menu. But why order a sandwich at a breakfast place? If a place is known to be one of the best at something, why fight it? I'm judging you. This location is not my favorite. It's unique in that it's inside a functional old timey drug store. There isn't a ton of seating and the line backs up and winds around the store, which is awkward. The Pamela's in the strip is superior as far as expedited seating and service. But if you are in Millvale and don't mind waiting near the NyQuil, grab some pancakes and potatoes. Cash only!",

They have fantastic specials that rotate on a 5 week basis. The weekend we were there they had peach melba hotcakes. My dad drove from WV to try them out, and he LOVED them! Be prepared to wait if you visit for breakfast on the weekend! But, even though the line stretched all the way to the back of the pharmacy when we arrived, we didn't wait more than half an hour for a table. It moves quickly, most people are really considerate of those who are waiting in line and vacate quickly after finishing their meals. The food arrived very quickly, service was very friendly and on top of all our needs. We will definitely be back!",

For breakfast, this place gets 5 stars, simply for the food. The service  is usually terrible and they use margarine instead of butter (GROSS), but it's excellent diner food. Lunch however is a totally different story. I ordered a 7 or 8 dollar BLT and it had three small pieces of bacon, two white end slices of tomato, and one thin leaf of lettuce on hard toasted bread so small it looked like an oversized finger sandwich. And not only is this terrible sandwich overpriced, it comes with no sides; no chips, no pickle, no fries...nothing and is so small it's served on a SAUCER. Paid $24  plus tip for a BLT, a turkey club, a coffee, a Pepsi and a side of fries. Come here for the breakfast but run away fast and far when the lunch hour hits...",

That said, we did come because we were looking for a local diner for breakfast and wanted something good and home cooked.   I was pretty surprised that the Millvale location was as hoppin' as it was! There isn't much going on in Millvale and was almost hesitant to visit this location. I saw the beaming reviews on Yelp! and being close to home sealed the deal.   We waited in line for about 15 minutes - it was quite busy the Sunday before Labor Day. The service was pretty slow - which was compounded by the fact that our server was new there.   I had the banana and chocolate chip hotcakes - OMG! They were to die for. The hotcakes are a cross between pancakes and crepes, in my opinion, and are thinner but have delicious crispy edges. The bananas and chocolate chips were rolled up in the hotcakes like crepes rather than piled on top a stack of pancakes. The chocolate was perfectly melted and not too sweet.   I also ordered the sausage - served in links and with a nice, crispy casing almost like handmade sausage.   ...and a chocolate malt...for breakfast!   The prices are really reasonable and me and my husband ate for less than $20.",

    "text": "I have been to all of the \"Pamela's\" diners in the Pittsburgh area, and this one is HANDS DOWN the absolute best. Once you eat here, you will never want to eat at the Pamela's in Oakland, The Strip, or Squirrel Hill ever again.   I dont know what it is about this place, but the food served at this Pamela's is exponentially better than the food served at other Pamela's (particularly Oakland's location - no watered-down coffee or rubbery eggs here!). The portions are huge, food comes out hot, and the coffee is strong. What else could you possibly need?!   The other thing I love about this location is that they include their famous lyonnaise potatoes with their \"Big Lincoln\" breakfast special, which is essentially the \"Morning After\" special at the Oakland Pamela's, which doesn't include the potatoes. I  know this is minor but I hated having to always pay for side of potatoes (because who can leave Pamela's without having a taste of those!?). Everything here is fantastic: lunch specials, pancakes, omelets etc. Never have had one thing here that wasn't on point.   This location is larger and open (not as cramped as some of the other locations), housed inside of the old Lincoln Pharmacy in Millvale. Tall ceilings, a whole wall of windows and the old soda fountain at the front of the diner make for a fun and unique atmosphere.   Of course there is always \"the wait\" if you are going for any weekend morning breakfast or brunch, but with Pamela's that's to be expected. No big deal. Tables turn fast here and we once went to this location with over 10 people in our party on a Sunday morning and waited only about 40 minutes. The other good thing about this location is that there is room to stand in line in the pharmacy..you can buy old school candy, knick knacks, and cheesy Pittsburgh themed gifts. Its not a bad wait at all.   Be sure to give this location a try and put it to the test of the other Pamela's in the area, you wont be disappointed!",

    "text": "Tremendous value and service for your breakfast dollar! Their pancakes served thin w/ buttery crispy edges are legendary. Pam & Gale, the original owners of all Pamela's Diners in the area, have even served up those luscious cakes for Michelle Obama - you can ask to see the chair she sat in upon her first visit now emblazoned w/ her name on a brass plate.  The very best item to order is the Lincoln Big Breakfast w/ two eggs over easy/scrambled, three pieces of bacon/sausage/ham, their butter drenched onion and potato Lyonnaise homefries AND two scrumptious pancakes. It will keep you satiated for a whole day.  They execute well w/ roving coffee refills from very friendly staff. I love Pamela's at all locations. They serve great homestyle breakfast and lunch in visually interesting places.  Ladies room is unisex and tucked away in the back reaches of the building. Pretty clean and stocked but TP was on a little hot water heater across from the commode which kind of makes me twitchy but not itchy! Ha!",

I went once, wasn't impressed, but given all the hype around it, thought my (unimpressive) experience must have been an outlier so this week I went again.   The food is completely ordinary and completely overpriced. I had a turkey club sandwich for ~$8. The sandwich was ok, nothing special. And the sides - wait, there were no sides. For $8, I got just a small deli sandwich. My child got a chicken sandwich for ~$7. It was a generic bun with what was a pre made chicken finger that anyone might buy in the frozen food isle of the grocery store. With no sides. For $7.  I could go on but it would be more of the same. In the end, I spent $50 for 4 sandwiches, 1 order of fries, and 3 drinks.   All I can say is fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. I should have learned my lesson after my first visit.",

She then grabbed napkins and silverware and placed them... when I looked down at my napkin she had Dorito dust smears all over my napkin. We ordered waters and one coffee. She served the coffee with her nasty chip painted fingernails with Dorito hands and touched the entire top of the coffee cup. I do not know how this is acceptable at all. I would never EVER recommend coming to this place. I couldn't believe how disgusting.. and unsanitary this place is. This place needs shut down and that girl needs to eat her Doritos OFF DUTY or never again. Plus she probably shouldn't be eating Doritos at 10 AM.",

Two eggs over easy, sausage links (my absolute favorite), lyonnaise potatoes, and two crepe style pancakes. I stick with plain, but the stuffed versions with sour cream and brown sugar are great too.  My wife loves their spinach and feta omelette with rye toast.  Friendly staff, quick service, and great prices. You'll have to wait during most visits, but it's rarely more than 10 minutes at this location.",

She came back around huffing and puffing, obviously upset. My dining partner asked her if she was ok. This made her even more angry. She walked away and told the other Kayla (the nice one) to take over our table. The manager / owner ended up coming over and comped our entire check.

Their pancakes are amazing, and \"The Big Lincoln\" might be the best bang for the buck breakfast in the state of Pennsylvania, if not beyond.  I went off book though the last time I was there and got the Chorizo Hash. It was flavorful and an ample portion.  If you've never been though, you have to try the pancakes. So large yet so thin, and those crispy edges. That's what they're known for. Oh, and the Obamas ate there while in town years ago.  To be fair, I've never been to any of the other locations besides Millvale. We never wait too long there, even when there's a line and can usually find parking on the street with relative ease. Will return again and again. I'm sure the other locations are just as good though.",

Now I'm intrigued! So I go against my norm and order a short stack. Let's just say this place put my belief back into pancakes. They were amazing! Extremely thin cake with crunchy edges is something I've never had before and I'm sold. Great job P&G. If we make it back to Pittsburgh you'll be my first food stop.",

When it first came out I immediately noticed it was very undercooked and floppy, I politely asked it be made crispy to which the waitress said sure no problem. Less than 2 minutes later the cook or food runner comes out with my bacon and it's literally slightly hotter and cooked like 4 % more. No where near crispy. I leave it there as I can't eat bacon that way. Moments before we leave? The couple next to us gets their food and their bacon was CRISPY and perfect. I could here it crunch as she ate it. So obviously the communication between the cook and waitress wasn't there....or the cook Just didn't give a shit. Either way, I'll take my business elsewhere.",

Potatoes had no seasoning at all.  A little salt and pepper could have gone a long way.  Service is always great.",

We decided to stop by Pamela's for breakfast but chose this location in Millvale because other locations, especially in Shadyside, tended to get long lines over the weekend. As we expected, we showed up around 8am and there was just a party or two in line ahead of us..so it wasn't too bad. It also helped that this restaurant is located in the same building as a drugstore...so I could browse around a bit and not get bored waiting in line...which was just about 10 min max.  I found the waiters and waitresses to be nice and courteous. They promptly took our orders...but..the bad part was...the good took forever to arrive at our table!! I wanted to say it must have been at least 30 min after we sat down before we all got our food. Food was good..large portion as you can always expect from Pamela's..but I suspect they suffer from a small kitchen..which literally forced the wait time for food to be a bit unbearable to me especially for a simple meal like breakfast.  Overall, decent breakfast..though I'm not sure if going to this location would actually save that much wait time..given you still have to wait for a long time for the food to arrive anyways.",

My first comment has to be about how accommodating the staff was.  My twin toddlers always sit in high chairs but that day my daughter declared \"I big now\" and refused so the server got us boosters instead.  Then my daughter threw her milk purposely on the floor.  I apologized profusely but our server cleaned up the mess without complaint.  A server who brought part of our to go order also rang us out so I didn't need to walk to the register with my crazies in tow.  It was a huge help.  Their attention and kindness was appreciated and I reflected that in the tip. Everything on the menu sounded amazing so it was tough to come to a decision.  When I did I chose the strawberry pancake for the kids and the chorizo hash for me.  The hash came with your choice of eggs and toast.  Not that I'd know that because my kids gobbled up both (so I guess they were good).  The chorizo hash was full of flavor and had just the right amount of kick. The strawberry pancake was heaven on a plate.  W, actually over a plate because it actually overhung the plate.  It was full of flavor and juicy, fresh strawberries.  Amazing.  I got a to go order of the potatoes because they are \"famous\" and I'm glad I did because they were incredible. The one thing to note is that they are cash only.  Not to worry, though, because there is an ATM on premises. It was an amazing dining experience and I can't wait to go back.",

Dessert for breakfast? Yes, please. Splitsies? Yes, please. I specifically recommend the chocolate banana variety. I'm still thinking about those buttery crispy edges. That's where the magic happens.  Trying to kick a hangover? Fancy yourself some kielbasa? Go BIG. Order the Pittsburgh Hash: a healthy serving/mixture of kielbasa, potatoes and sauerkraut paired with eggs and toast. Sweatpants and a to go box are also recommended.   Two other notes: I appreciated the price point of $9-$12 -- manageable and justifiable given the portion sizes and creativity of the dishes I experienced. Cash only!! $$$   Only drawback?

The food was literally so good I returned for a second day. It was not my first time at this particular location and I've also been to the Pamela's in the Strip District. I know what to expect from the food... absolute perfection. I always order the Tex Mex Omelet with Wheat Toast and the Lyonnaise Potatoes. I've never been disappointed by the food.  Sunday, the line was a little longer. They weave you between the aisles in the Lincoln Pharmacy while you wait. There's plenty to look at while you linger in line. Lots of Pittsburgh trinkets and novelty items to browse through which is somewhat entertaining. But, for some reason the wait was extra-long on Sunday. You could see that tables weren't being cleaned off as quickly as usual. Plus, our group was half-way finished with our food by the time my brother even received his meal... I think we caught them on an off day.  Place feels historic, but is clean and has a different atmosphere from the tourist traps in the Strip District. The food is always excellent!! I highly recommend eating here, if you have the time to spare and patience to wait.",

I think it beats the other locations by a mile in regards to service and size of the establishment.  This one is located in Millvale off of the beaten path of your standard popular downtown Pittsburgh locations, but it is worth the trip (and it is actually closer to my house than any of the other ones so it's a win-win for me).  There are a lot of tables and it is alwayssss busy, but we've never had to wait more than 20-30 minutes - and if you've been to Pamelas in any other part of town, that's not bad at all.  During my most recent visit with my mom, we were seated immediately.  Our service has always been excellent.  My mom and I always order the chocolate chip banana hotcakes to split and we both get a different omelette.  My favorite is the Tex-Mex and it comes stuffed with delicious chili/chorizo and cheese, plus a heaping scoop of guac on top with the famous lyonnaise potatoes and toast.  It is truly a size that could feed a small army and I think its under $10.  Pamela's is a Pittsburgh staple and if you're in town, you must stop in to try it. The hype is for real.  Cash only I think at (all) locations.  Get the hotcakes to split, too. Thank me later.",

I'd highly recommend the strawberry or chocolate chip and banana hotcakes.  They are really thin but will fill you up.  All 3 of us ordered hotcakes for our meals and were very pleased with both the quality of the food and the service by the staff at such a busy time.    Pamela's is a beautiful Pittsburgh staple.

    "text": "---UPDATE--- After posting my original 2 star review regarding a poor experience and deceptive billing practices, I was contacted by the owner.  She offered to refund my meal if I emailed her my details to her @aol.com email address.  I did as requested on 3/28/18.  I never received a response from Pam and even reached out to her here on Yelp.  I have found that restaurant managers/owners will respond on Yelp so that everyone can see that they care...only to never live up to their promises of rectifying an issue that occurred at their establishment.  Unfortunately Pamela's is one of those businesses.  I have now updated my review to 1 star and will never eat at Pamela's when I visit the burgh.  ---ORIGINAL REVIEW--- I have given this diner 4 star reviews in the past.  This time however I was very disappointed.  We had 3 in our party.  They ordered 2 eggs over easy, ham, lyonnaise potatoes, iced tea white toast...and 2 pancakes, potatoes, sausage, and I think possibly 2 eggs with iced tea again.  I ordered 2 eggs over easy, potatoes, wheat toast, and sausage, coffee and water.  Their orders came out yet mine was nowhere to be found.  They both said that their orders were good as usual.  6 minutes later my plate found its way to our table by someone other than our waiter.  The over easy eggs were barely cooked.  When I cut into the whites, an obscene amount of clear egg white rolled all over my plate.  Not a little bit, I estimate 1/8 of a cup or two tablespoons.  Mind you, this was not milky white almost cooked egg whites...it was raw liquid that poured to the edge of the plate.  Our waiter was nowhere around nor did he come back to check on my plate after it sauntered out about the time the rest of our party was 75% finished.  I called the lady I thought was in charge to the table.  She looked at the eggs and offered to get new ones.  I declined since my party was almost finished.  I asked that they be removed but I would pay for the potatoes, toast and sausage.  I am pretty sure she crossed out the 7.95 order that I initially had and added a 5.95 and 2.95.  WHAT?!  So take the eggs out and I was charge a la carte for potatoes, toast and sausage and I get charged more because my eggs were raw?  The total bill after tax was $27.90.  That's obscene.  If management reads this I would love to know why they think this is acceptable.  If my math is wrong please let me know and I will update this review.  Until then, I am supremely disappointed and mildly pissed.",

Breakfast was so tasty, but get here on the early side ,8-8:30(especially on the weekends!!) otherwise the wait could be around the block. The portions are big, so be sure to go hungry. A staple of Pittsburgh for over 30 years and the pancakes are to die for along with the crepes. Very satisfying breakfast with friendly service and staff members.   Please note, cash only and there is no ATM on site.",

We, of course, had the hot cakes. Their hot cakes are like thin pancakes wrapped up with toppings. We had the banana with chocolate chip and strawberry. Both were delicious. The strawberry one had fresh strawberries and a ton of strawberries for that matter. We got the meal with one of the hot cakes so that we also got eggs and hash browns to cut some of the sweetness. Service here was excellent and the prices are very affordable. The advantage of this location is that Michelle Obama ate here and there is a chair with her name on it. We only waited 5 minutes for a table and it was on a Saturday in May at 10 AM.",

The place is rather large, 1/2 restaurant and 1/2 pharmacy.  We were greeted, seated, and handed menus.    This seems to be a place locals hit because a of the waitstaff was on first name basis with most people who came in.  This turned out to be something that did not work in our favor.  The waitress came our and took our order.  I had coffee while the wife had water.  I ordered the Banana Walnut hotcakes and she order a veggie omelette.  it did not take too long for our food to come out but that was the last time our waitress visited our table.  Since the place is open we could see the counter and where the food was being prepared.  if you were a local the waitress would come to chat and refill drinks.  I had to ask a passing waitress twice for more coffee while our waitress was behind the counter chatting with other staff.  The food was OK Nothing really extraordinarily.  What the menu calls hotcakes are really Swedish Pancakes (ie crepes).  Mine was just cut up Banana with walnut bits rolled up.  I ended up having chunks of banana for 1 bite then another bits of just the crepe.  The potatoes were very dense which you could see by the pile of potatoes on the grill.  They would just cut off a chunk of the diced potatoes.  My wifes omelette ,again, was just average.  The waitress, who was not our original one, came to pick up the plates and chat.  She was very personable. In fact, every staff person we interacted with was nice.     Go early. No lines.",

(To be fair, I lived out of the state for a good chunk of that time.) I started coming to the Millvale location several weeks ago, and to my delight, the food lives up to its reputation. What I like best are the pancakes.  Just plain pancakes...or ARE they? They are crepe-thin and have these crispy edges that keep me coming back for more. Seriously, the first time I went, I ordered some special filled pancakes, and then put in ANOTHER ORDER FOR MORE BECAUSE I AM A PANCAKE MONSTER.   Their Lyonnaise potatoes are renowned, though I'd say they are just slightly above average for my taste.  They are usually best accompanied by an omelette, and they have plenty of those plus a rotational special.  FYI, as with all good breakfast diners, they get busy by 10am, but the tables turn over fast.  It's cash only, and they do have an ATM in house.",

The pancakes are a staple - super buttery, plate sized, thin & crispy.  How every pancake should be.  The omelets are cheesy and just melt in your mouth.   I don't know if anyone orders lunch items from here - I can't imagine waiting for a table (which can take a long time) and not getting breakfast but who knows.

Apparently there is almost always a line on the weekends, but it moved pretty quickly when we were there (I think we waited maybe 15 minutes or so?) Although the wait to get seated wasn't very long, there was a crazy long wait for our food - over an hour! Ahh! My friends and I and weren't in a hurry, so this wasn't a huge deal, but an hour for some pancakes seems a little excessive. Maybe they were just trying to build up the anticipation for the meal? If that's the case, it definitely worked, because I was SUPER excited when those much-hyped, oh-so-famous Pamela's pancakes arrived. I had ordered the special pancakes of the day....raspberry and chocolate chip (YUM!) However, they did not live up to expectations. The raspberries rolled up inside the pancakes were uneven in temperature -- some bites I got a mouthful of ice-cold raspberry, and in other bites the raspberries were warm and soft. The pancakes themselves were a little rubbery, and holy cow were they greasy! I mean, I get that this is a greasy spoon diner and that grease is a part of the whole experience, but this was TOO much. I don't deny that I'm a fan of a good greasy meal now and then, but I draw the line at my food leaving a ring of yellow oil behind where it was on the plate. Make my food greasy, but don't let me see just how much grease you used, please! That's just gross and unappetizing. Anyhow, the bottom line is that my pancakes were \"meh\", and I don't get the hype for this place. Sorry, Pittsburgh. :(",

There was a line, but we didn't have to wait very long. We ordered a Lincoln breakfast and a Tex mex omelette. Both were good, I would say the pancakes and sausage were my favorite parts of the Lincoln breakfast. The omelette was good too. I wasn't too crazy about the potatoes, but it seemed like others loved them so I guess it's just preference. It was very busy so the service was a little delayed, but I will say that we never had to ask for a refill, they were very prompt with that.  We will definitely return, I want to try some of their other dishes as well as a milkshake. This place had such a great atmosphere too.",

I am not squeamish when it comes to smoking for the most part, but this is not 1960 anymore and there are health department regulations.

Finally my husband's Tex Mex Omelet came out. It was, as he described, \"disgusting\" and \"watery in the center\". His side potatoes did not taste good. My specialty Belgian Waffle with strawberries and bananas had nothing special about it at all. The price was expensive for the quality. There are much better breakfast restaurants in Pittsburgh.

This location is our preference among the chain for its easy street parking, a lively atmosphere with the attached pharmacy (and plenty of kitsch), and staff that know our order before we give it. Breakfast can get busy, especially on the weekends, but counter-seating is first available, and generally only a five minute wait even at the busiest times.  So, when we're in the mood for easy, consistent, affordable breakfast diner food, this is our place of choice.

There's actually an old fashioned soda fountain in this place.  I had an excellent spinach and feta omelette that came with the best home fries.  Not sure what they did to them, but they were crispy the way I like them.  If you find yourself driving through Millvale, it's definitely worth a stop!",

    "text": "the lyonnaise potatoes are worth the trip alone. great breakfast spot, the wait in line can be long, and you'll have to wait a pretty decent amount of time for your food too, so i wouldn't advise coming completely starving. Phosphates are really good and not too sweet.",

    "text": "We have been to Pamela's a number of times. The food and the service has slowly deteriorated. Most recently we waited nearly an hour for a table and it was another 45 minutes for our food to be served. The server gave us an excuse that they were trying a new system that all food was delivered at the same time. Rather than delivering the food when it was ready. The eggs were hard and over cooked. The sausage was shriveled and tough. The only entree that was decent were the hotcakes. All in all we won't be back for a long time.",
