    "text": "I was planning to attend a conference in Pittsburgh and was researching food joints that I wanted to check out. A friend of mine insisted that I go to Pierogies Plus telling me that the food was so good that ever since he went that he has had pierogies mail-ordered to his house each year. While I have never been a huge fan of pierogies, I figured that I should heed my friends advice since he generally steers me to places I enjoy. Let's just say in this case, he hit the ball out of the park.  I actually wound up going to Pierogies Plus straight from the airport. After getting in a rental car and plugging in my GPS, imagine my surprise when my GPS announced \"You have reached your destination.\" and I found myself sitting outside what appeared to be an old service station. When I walked inside and up to the counter, I found a crew of Polish women rocking out every kind of Pierogi imaginable. I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of choices.  Wanting to try everything, I wound up going with their Sampler Platter #1 which was a small haluski (a noodle and cabbage mixture), a stuffed cabbage, and four pierogi ( I wound up going with a potato with bacon, potato with cheese, potato with jalapeno, and potato with meat). The food was outrageously good. I'm actually salivating just thinking back on the meal. The stuffed cabbage was not marred by the typical dryness that can afflict that dish and was perfectly sauced. The haluski, a dish I had never heard of, was amazing.  While I can't expect everyone to make their way to Pittsburgh solely to go to Pierogies Plus, do yourself a favor and order some. Those wonderful ladies deserve your business. Your belly will appreciate it!",

Order ahead for big holidays - we order several dozen every year for Easter and the take out line stretches out the door all day on Good Friday. I particularly like the apricot and cream cheese and the prune varieties. Potato and cheddar are great, too, of course!",

I normally put together my own, but I was too busy, and I wanted to make sure it was just as special. The wonderful people at Pierogies Plus made sure my sister had a delicious surprise, and they were wonderful and kind every time I called.  My sister and brother-in-law raved over the pierogies, and my sister was absolutely delighted by the dessert apricot ones! (They received them fresh the evening they were made, and then froze the rest -- fresh and frozen were both delish!) I cannot recommend this place enough!  TLDR: Go buy your pierogies here!",

When I got home and opened the containers, something smelled odd.  When I started to eat, it tasted just as odd.  As it turns out, what is referred to as 'butter sauce' is a misrepresentation of what it really is-----margarine, which I eliminated from my diet years ago because of the trans fats and the fact that any way you cut it, butter makes for a better product.  Sorry Allison B, ain't no butter here.  Margarine is used as a cost-cutting measure, and it just can't measure up.  I rinsed off the peirogies and browned them in some butter and my own onions.   The haluski got thrown away.  For the prices being charged for these products, the proprietor can well-afford to use butter.",

    "text": "Love butter? Then get thee to Pierogies Plus.  I live in St. Louis, and it seems like the only pierogi I can find are in my grocer's freezer. Oh, but when I go home to Pittsburgh, I can have as much of the chewy, flavorful, buttery goodness as I desire from Pierogies Plus.  The place still looks like an old service station with a tiny building and a roof over an old gas pump island. Inside, though, magical elves... uh... I mean fabulous Polish women... create deliciousness with love -- and butter. Have I mentioned that butter is a part of the deal? Because it totally is. You really should fast for two days before picking up pierogi from here.  Oh, but you'll be happy you did. I'm vegetarian, so I only order meat-free pierogi. I'm in love with the saurkraut and the cheese varieties. When you pick up a hot order, you'll get your pierogi covered in with rich butter and sauteed onions. No, I'm serious -- the pierogi are SWIMMING in butter. It's the best thing ever. Everything is packed inside a styrofoam container and a plastic bag, because butter WILL spill out.  You also can order cold or frozen pierogi if you plan to, say, lug them to the middle of the country to enjoy in a far-off city.  Besides many varieties of pierogi, you also can get things from the deli cases. Last time, I had some apricot blintzes, a latke and some type of apple turnover thingy. I really hope Pierogies Plus has the blintzes when I visit next.  Awesome thing: Pierogies Plus usually has coupons in the Entertainment Book. My best friend and I steal all of the coupons from our families so that I can get a steady stream of discounted Polish goodness each time I visit.  The only downside is that Pierogies Plus often closes for several days around holidays. I totally understand it -- family time is important! -- but that often coincides with my visits (I head east around the holidays mainly because I get an extra day with the fam without having to take another vacation day). I've learned to plan my trips around the Pierogies Plus schedule, though, because I MUST have yummy goodness. A pierogi-less Allison is a cranky Allison.",

I lightly pan-fried them before serving and didn't add much butter.  You're not going to find a restaurant takeout that's more quintessentially 'Pittsburgh', than this place!

Her parents were Czech and our annual vacations to visit my grandparents were wonderful - filled with family dinners including stuffed cabbage, peirogies, and haluski.  Now that my mother is older and lives alone making things like stuffed cabbage is difficult for her.  I saw Peirogies Plus featured on the Food Network years ago and decided to send my mom an assortment for her birthday.  When her package arrived she called me immediately and said \"Where did you get this food???\".  This is the real deal - traditional, authentic, ethnic food.  The gift I sent took my mother back to her own mother's kitchen.  It's the comfort food to beat all comfort foods - it also takes me back to my childhood all those summers ago!  I'm ordering again for my mother's birthday.  The only \"problem\" now is that I have to order enough to include my brothers and sisters who mysteriously show up at my mother's house once the rumor that the package has arrived makes the rounds.",

Ithought I would jump on the deal as I try to be frugal when I can and I like trying different things. My hot sausage sandwich was fantastic. This is a sandwich I don't normally crave but when done right it can be quite satisfying. The bun was the perfect mix of soft and firm and the sausage had a great snap to it. The peppers were pretty good as well. I chose to go with cheese and potato as my side. The cashier was very friendly and my order was prepared quickly. I was given a to go container with three pierogies swimming in some type of onion butter sauce. The noodles were super fresh and soft and the potato filling tasted like fresh mashed potatoes. I smashed this meal quickly and was tempted to go back to try the haluski and some of their dessert pierogies. If you like pierogies you gotta check this place out!",

They also have haluski, stuffed cabbage and other things that I am looking forward to trying next time.",

Order them hot if you want them right then and there because these nice ladies also sell them cold to take home too.   Hot and buttery, buttery, buttery, and covered in sauteed onions is how you'll get them. So good. We shared the potato and cheese, potato and sauerkraut, and hot sausage varieties. Delicious, them all.",

We got there right before closing but they still served us with a smile.  We had the #2 and the #7, both were yummy.  Those pierogies couldn't have had any more filling in them, they are packed with goodness.  This was the first time we have ever had Haluski, it was awesome.  We also had the nut horns for dessert.  Buy some for the car ride home!  There are a few seats outside the shop but it is mostly carry out.  Also don't let the neighborhood scare you, the food is worth it!!",

While in line I met folks from Rhode Island, Kentucky, and North Carolina, who all had come to McKees Rocks in their rental cars straight from the airport before even going to see their families - that is dedication and commitment to some seriously delicious pierogies. After enjoying a dozen of these filling, savory, perfect pierogies, I think once I move away from here I will be making that same trip to Pierogies Plus myself.",

They have a great selection of different pierogies but we went with the potato and kabasi as well as the stuffed cabbage. The stuffed cabbage was out of this world, the meat and sauce inside was very nicely done, the flavors were perfect - you can tell it was made with love. The pierogies were also very good and filling.   The shop has some cool memorabilia on the walls of famous chefs, and newspapers articles written about Pierogies Plus and their owners.

Pierogies Plus wins Best Pierogies every year. Why? Because the owner is from Poland and she is making the real deal pierogies. The best part is that they are hand pinched by a group of older Polish and Hungarian women.  The biggest seller is potato and cheese but they sell many flavors. They are like plump pillows of softness. You can buy them buy the dozen. You can get them cold to take home and freeze or warm and ready to eat. The warm ones are served with butter and onions.  It's definitely a comfort food. The best part is that they ship internationally. Yes, they are that good.",

The sandwich was tasty, but the star of the lunch were the pierogies and the kind and knowledgeable employees; who served me and provided me with shipping menu's to bring home, so I can continue to enjoy these little tasty gems of quality made with love the traditional way.  Before I left I was graciously introduced to the owner and because I was so pleased with the pierogies I bought some frozen \"Angels\" (miscellaneous variety of broken pierogies) to bring home with me.

They are good however they come in WAY too much butter/oil. They are probably soaked in at least a half a cup or more of butter/oil. When I get them I have to take them out of all the butter/oil b/c it would make me completely sick if I ate them as is. Other than that the pierogies themselves are decent.  However, they are pretty pricey. About $12 for 1 dozen.  Recommend eating here if you're passing through or nearby but I wouldn't go out of my way.",

It's amazing to get there at 10:55am, 5 minutes before they open and see the mad rush of people getting pierogies.  By 11am, the line is already out the door.  Always a good sign.

Immediately the lady said ' we have no Pierogies left for sale'. I replied okay. So while standing there a gal can in w/two others. She asked 'any Pierogies' and a different gal answered ' sorry we're sold out'. So the customer said to friends 'guess we're Eaton Arby's'. Just then the sales gal said what did you want?  Lady replied 'we wanted some to eat now'. The sales gal replied 'well I could do two dozen'. Meanwhile I just asked to buy some. This place is obviously operated by morons. They can keep their slimy bland crap Pierogies and stick where the sun don't shine. They aren't that great anyway just a time saver. Plenty of others that are better. So shove it P!!",

    "text": "Another one of the Pittsburgh areas hidden gems. Pierogis Plus has cornered the market with their amazing traditional dishes from Poland and Central Europe, I've discovered lots of local restaurants carry them and serve them like Pirogies Plus or their own style.   Delicious pillow shaped pirogies are sold by the half dozen or dozen either hot or cold. Cold, are chilled but not frozen packaged to take home. Hot are swimming in butter steaming hot turns into instant comfort food.  Traditionally filled with potato, sauerkraut, cheese and minced meat, they also have hot sausage, jalapeno potato and bacon or great combos you can custom order like sauerkraut with kielbasa.  Other great dishes like stuffed cabbage, haluski noodles and lots of other items not on the menu is the result of a bunch of mothers and grandmothers are confined to a kitchen and creating great food.",

    "text": "Great pierogies and haluski.  A bit pricey for what you get and their deals for bulk orders are not great compared to other places (for example, Gosia's is better and will give you a deal on a big order).  Pierogies Plus is not the best pierogies in the city--keeping in mind there's a lot of competition here--but they definitely are the best Polish food in the McKees Rocks area.  The main reason that I deducted a star is because every staff member there has been incredibly rude over the phone or in person.  I got yelled at by a staff person once when I rather meekly pointed out their website prices did not match their in-store prices--not my fault the website was not up-to-date.",

I ordered online since I'm in the middle of a big work project and couldn't get out. The delivery came in good time and before I could even look in the bag, I got a phone call from Monica informing me that it was the wrong order. Long story short, Monica went above and beyond to correct the error and I was blown away by the customer service. Not only will I order again, but I'm having my entire office do so with me! Thank you Monica and Pierogies Plus!",

I love how convenient this restaurant is and you know it's good food because it's been rated some of the top Pierogies in the city. They have a ton of options on their menu but make sure you call ahead to order if you are getting large quantities. When picking up I asked what their best sellers were and she told me definitely the potato and cheese ones. I tried them and they were great. The potato and bacon Pierogies are also very good. I like how you have the option to pick them up hot or cold and their website gives you instructions on how to properly heat and cook them multiple ways if needed. They offer some coupons online as well. Give it a try if you're in the area.",

    "text": "Deep down inside I know I have a week spot for anything potatoes.  With my background, when you add dough to this mix, I get week in the knees.  I have been wanting to come here for the longest time, and finally made that a reality.  I do have to say, if you are expecting to come here and have a huge dine in experience, better rethink that.  I'm not saying that you can't, but you really can't.  Let me explain.  You order your food inside at a small counter and then you wait.  You get your food and most people literally roll out of the parking lot.  However, there is a small area outside with a few tables that you can sit at if you do not want to take it to go.  That's what we did.  It did not take very long for our food to be ready.  When I looked at my food I thought that I was given the wrong thing, but it was my fault.  I really wanted the kielbasa but my eyes played a trick on me and I got the stuffed cabbage.  I am not the biggest fan of cooked cabbage, but somehow they made it edible for me.  I really did enjoy it, but don't count on me doing that again.  What I wanted to focus on was the pierogies.  I love pierogies, and these did not disappoint.  They are huge.  I am not exaggerating on that.  These are not the pierogies you find in other area restaurants let alone the grocery store.  These were the biggest pierogies I have ever seen.  It's like they filled the palms of their hands to the brim and then wrapped it all in dough.  And whoever is doing this has some big hands.  Each bite of these I had to keep myself from rolling my eyes back in my head.  I was in heaven.  The butter and onions with each bite was amazing.  I could go back right now if I could.    If you do get it to go, they do an incredible job of wrapping this up so that it will not leak out.  In a food container, then into a clear bag and then inside another bag.  If this were to leak, then that's on you.",

Then I discovered Pierogies Plus. After reading countless positive reviews, I decided to give them a try. I ordered about 4 dozen of the potato, cheese & jalapeno pierogies- I was picking them up fresh and cooking them at home. I was surprised when I first saw this place- it was so small and adorable, a real mom & pops place. The service was really friendly and my order came out perfectly. I just sauteed these bad boys in some oil, butter, and fried onions and WOW were they tasty. They are quite big and packed with flavor. We loved them. I will definitely be coming back here.  PS. They have coupons online that will save you $$ on pierogie orders- I recommend using them :)",

They're definitely handmade and homemade. You can taste each folded crease and it's not something you just heat up from a frozen package. There are a variety of fillings than just potatoes. We got ones with cottage cheese and chives filling and potato and cheese filling. I personally liked the potato and cheese filling more but the cottage cheese and chives filling was delicious too.   Pierogies Plus seems like a pretty well known place in that area since there was never a time without a line of people waiting to order or grab their food. There's only a couple outdoor seating because the location actually used to be a gas station. So the inside is only the kitchen and ordering place. Also parking space isn't too big.   Definitely worth driving here to get the most authentic, homemade pierogies!",

Plan some extra time, because this is not fast food. The counter always seems slow to me, they do things their own way, but now I find it rather charming.   They have some coupons on their website, and there have been Groupon deals in the past, so check for those.  Bottom line, the Pierogies are amazing and authentic.",

    "text": "The cutest little pierogie shop. It's owned by a polish family so they have authentic food. They have so many options and are willing to be flexible with ordering things. I got the #1 sampler which came with stuffed cabbage, haluski, and 4 pierogies(I chose 4 different flavors). Everything was amazing!! Some of the best polish food I've ever eaten. There are a few tables to sit outside if you'd like which is nice when it's warmer out.",

    "text": "Best pierogies in Pittsburgh, which is saying a lot. They taste like they just came out of a sweet Polish grandmother's kitchen. You can get them frozen to take home or hot to eat immediately, and they come in a lot of different flavors. I got a platter, with pierogies, halushki, and kielbasa. It was a HUGE amount of food for a good price, but everything was drenched in butter and oil (which I'm sure some people would love, but it was too much for me). The location is a little drive out of the city, and it's off the side of a road, but there are parking spots there and tables out front to eat at. Keep in mind that there's no seating inside the place, so if it's too cold outside to eat, you'll have to bring your food home.",
