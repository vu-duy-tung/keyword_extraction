Everything was very reasonably priced, and meals include a drink option. Absolutely delicious food and pastries! I haven't found this quality food, especially pastries, in the US. The desserts easily rival what you would find in an upscale restaurant. We ate dessert at the shop, and took a second round home to share! Even though it's a two hour drive, I will certainly be returning.",

The brioche is good (not the best I've had but still solid), the pain au chocolat is also delicious. Pastries are slightly sweet but still 10 times better than the average american pastry. The only disappointment was the baguette - it was far better than what grocery stores call \"baguettes\" but still had a bland quality to it. I think if I had gotten their other baguette (it looked like what the French call \"tradition\") it would've probably been better. I will definitely come back when in the area!!",

It's very similar to the other location, but had parking. The food was exactly the same. My almost 2-year old scarfed down almost a whole order of chocquettes and I had an almond croissant with a cup of tea. There were a few more tables than Lawrenceville, I think, and we were happy to be able to grab one and enjoy our breakfast. It's nice that there are two locations to visit with the same quality at each.",

I've gone three times in the two weeks they've opened.  The first time I went at about 11:30 for just a baguette and I waited in line 10 minutes, behind only two people.  The next time I stopped in for a baguette about 2pm and they had none left, so I left, too. (Seriously - a french bakery should NEVER run out of baguettes.)  The straw that broke the camel's back was arriving this past Sunday at 9:30 a.m.  The line was out the door - kudos to them for their popularity - but it took 40 minutes to get served! And all I wanted was a baguette and two croissants.  They need to figure out a better system, like more staff or two registers.   If I ever see more than two cars in the parking lot, I will head straight to Giant Eagle for my bread instead.",

My first visit was late in the day on a Saturday. Unfortunately, almost everything was sold out. I ended up with a chocolate croissant. It was flaky and delicious but I was not blown away. I wondered what all the hype was about. My second encounter with LG was during a party I attended. LG supplied the desserts in the form of bite size portions of their popular treats including (my fav) the chocolate eclair. Ok. Now I'm starting to get it. Those were three delicious bites. My next encounter was earlier in the day on a Saturday. I opted for the cherry bread pudding. OMG. Yep. I'm converted. It was so incredible. Hubs wanted a taste but there was no way I was going to share. Overall, forget about the calories and just go! My only gripe is that all of the portions are huge! I'd love to be able to stop in and get several small croissants or other treats.",

However, the decor is really low budget, certainly not very French- more like a Subway shop- and lacked any sort of old world Parisian charm. No French music here, no rustic wood floors- cheap linoleum tile floors like you'd see in your kids school restroom. and no French decor that i could see. There are only 3-4 small tables and chairs, and again, not French feeling at all. I was really disappointed in the ambiance, as they gutted the place to make this bakery and this is the decor they came up with?? Not very cozy or inviting. No specialty coffees available either. Was hoping for a cafe au lait to enjoy with my quiche - no such luck. Would i recommend? Yes for the pastries, no for a Parisian escape in the South Hills of Pittsburgh.  And the parking is very limited.",

When I happened to drive by this location, I knew I had to stop.  I planned on getting just one or two sweet treats.  Impossible!  Their case looks amazing, the bread smells amazing, everything is just so tantalizing, that I ended up with 4!  From recommendations of some nice gentlemen savoring their treats, I got an individual-sized lemon torte, some cookie thing with pistachio cream and fresh strawberries, a chocolate croissant and a brie-sour cream torte.  To say that they were outstanding would be an understatement.  The brie torte was likely my favorite as I am a savory kind of girl.  It was brie and sour cream mixed with pepper and spices in the middle of the flakiest crust I have ever had in my life bread.  Absolutely delicious!  Don't waste your time wondering if this is as good as you hear or just dream about going there.  Go.  Go now.  And bring something back for me!",

And, my husband wanted some additional croissants , but the lady with the dark hair, who i believe is part owner of the business, was coughing and coughing everywhere! She barely  covered her mouth, and was standing right over the uncovered pastries!  My husband changed his mind pretty quick. Thank goodness the other stuff was already in bagged and she didn't wait on us! This was the last week of  December 2017.  Considering you work in a food business, and if you have a cough that bad, you shouldn't be around food!  Very disappointed! This was the Mt. Lebanon location.",

When I found out La Gourmandine was coming to Mount Lebanon, to say I was stoked is an understatement.  Many times I had visited the Lawrenceville location later in the day only to find my favorite treat out of stock.  Now that they're in our back yard, it's more than easy to run for a morning pastry and a coffee (probably not a good thing for my wallet nor my waist).  Honestly, everything here is solid (and from what I've heard from a few French friends, truly representative of a French pastry shop).  A word of warning...  this place gets busy during the weekend mornings and you can easily drop a small fortune on baked goods if you don't exhibit self-control.  Try stopping by on a weekday morning if you can, grab a coffee and enjoy one of their pastries warmed up...  doesn't get any better than that in the South Hills!",

It is pricey, but you get what you pay for, and you leave with great quality products.  I will definitely be returning, I have desserts I left behind and breads I would like to try.

All of them were amazing but I'll be back for more raspberry tartlettes, the sandwich and the croissants.  My daughter loved the macaron - she will be asking about more of those for days to come.    Fortunately/Unfortunately, I see myself popping in here weekly in the future, and I will have a hard time holding back from coming in daily... if it becomes more than an occasional thing, I will need to get more spin classes in!!",

The finely crafted desserts and pastries are what they're famous for, but their sandwiches are incredible. And, of course, they have great quiche. They even feature locally brewed coffee.

There's nothing that I've had from La Gourmandine that I haven't liked. Almond croissants, chocolate croissants, apricot pastries, and even sandwiches. Everything is flaky, buttery, and absolutely perfect. I absolutely love that the dessert pastries are sweet, but not overwhelmingly sweet.   My only complaint is that you kind of have to know what you want when coming in. The workers try to be efficient and get everyone out the door as soon as possible, so that could be a lot of pressure when you're just in awe of all the beautiful options. However, you really could just point randomly at anything in the display case and it be good. You also can't go wrong with any of the items I listed above if you want to go in prepared to spitfire your order. But one bite of a pastry and you can forget all about being rushed to order.   I will be here again and again and I recommend you do the same! So worth it!",

Across the street is an abandoned gas station where I would imagine you can park if need be.  Stopped here for lunch with my daughter. I ordered the goat cheese and spinach quiche while she settled for a ham and cheese on a French baguette. They advised me for dessert to get the almond danish which is filled with almond creme. It must have been very popular since I got the last one! I noticed later on they restocked them.  That sandwich of her's was so huge I thought there was no way she could finish it but she did. My quiche was heated and brought out to me. It was okay. I'm not used to goat cheese but it wasn't overly filling so I could enjoy my danish. That almond danish was very flaky and literally came apart on me as I ate it. It was delicious!  She had some sort of chocolate bar dessert which she let me sample. It was very rich and quite filling had I ordered it.  They only have a few tables if you wish to eat in. Take out is available and of course you can call if you want to preorder baked goods or their breads.   The staff was very friendly and helpful. If you eat inside then your food is served on actual dishes and they will let you box up leftovers to take home. As we were leaving I purchased a fruit filled macaroon cookie for my daughter and a chocolate chip style danish for a friend. I was told that danishes will only last a day but does not need refrigeration while anything in their refrigerated case should be placed in the refrigerator once you get home.  This place is easy to miss since it sits near the corner of Cochran and Cedar roads. Still it made for a nice mid day treat for both of us. My advice would be to get there early for best selection. Will definitely visit it again sometime in the future.",

It's not as fancy as Gaby et Jules in Squirrel Hill, and that's a good thing. This place feels like a neighborhood bakery that you can (and we do) stop at frequently, not an occasional indulgence. I love their sandwiches, the bread makes such a difference, and they're less than $6! They usually only have 4 kinds of macarons, but I think they're only $1.75 and they're better and cheaper than what you get at whole foods or various cafes in town. Their pistachio pastry cream is absolutely amazing - there's always a pistachio macaron and 1-3 other pastries that use it.   Wishlist? I do wish they had some whole grain/seedy bread - but maybe that's a German/Scandinavian thing. Also, drinks are pretty limited, orangina or carbonated water would be a nice addition to their lunches.",

The tarts were also very delectable.  The only thing to know is that they use almond flour here.  My boyfriend has a nut allergy, but he's been fine eating the things with no added nuts.  The line can be long sometimes but the service is quick and friendly.  When the line's long, then it must be worth the wait.  It's also a little pricier than your average bakery, but you're getting quality.....not just a donut!",

My wife is a big fan of all sweet baked goods, so I requested \"a few sweets for my wife.\" The woman was very nice and pleasant, and recommend a chocolate dish of some sorts and a lemon tart. Though I usually avoid sweets altogether, I decided to try some of the lemon tart. It was quite possibly the best dessert I've ever had. It's changed my entire outlook on desserts.",

    "text": "I will say this if I lived in the area this would be very dangerous.. why because everything is FABULOUS. They have three locations and we came to this (the Mt. Lebanon) location since it was near family we were visiting. It's not a very big place, there are a few tables, you can get your coffee and treats and stay but to be honest I'd get your things to go. It's a busy place and EVERYONE is ordering everything and a lot of it. If you have no clue or your French is rusty the staff is helpful in giving you information. I believe I spoke to  owner maybe and used my very bad French but I was proud of myself that I spoke to her. The croissants are to die for.. the only ones better are in Paris or a small place in Chicago called Vanille' Patisserie or in Montreal. No place where I currently live in Rochester, NY can compare. The Pain du Chocolate is excellent as well as the Almond croissants. The eclairs omg so luscious, the Paris  Brest, the Pommes  (apple tarts) omg as well as other treats. I'm still eating every bit of it...what I will say is the baguette is excellent but you best eat that the same day. They have macaroons, cakes, oh my... it's absolutely fabulous that the people of Pittsburgh have this most fabulous, decedent boulangerie (bakery). You must come, the prices are fair and for what I bought which was a lot considering was under $40. If you live in the area and come here sign u for the rewards program. They offered it to me but I stated we lived out of state. I know next time I'll sign up as I know we will be back to the area. They have a small parking lot and it's a small location be prepared to wait but it's worth it.. Hells yes I will be back!",

I started with the Lawrenceville location and absolutely loved it - when I found out there was one closer to me, I was very excited.  My typical weekly buy is the Macaron aux Fruits - a large macaron filled with lychee cream and raspberries. It is DIVINE!   Other treats that I've tried:  Choux a la creme - this was great for a very light sweet treat. Airy pastry with a very light cream filling.   Delice de pistache - I was very excited to try this one as I normally love pistachio anything. I was not a big fan of the choux dough combined with the pistachio cream, but the cream itself was lovely.  Choquettes - these little guys are great for small treats. Tasty dough that is similar to a donut and dusted with sugar, and you get a dozen for $3!  Vegetarian quiche - I'm not well versed in the world of quiches but I was not a big fan of this. I think goat cheese is probably a love it or hate it thing, and I was not a fan of this. Would still like to try the other quiche with the bacon though!  Marquis - Rich, chocolatey, and definitely indulgent!  Mouelleux au chocolat - Very rich and very delicious! Kind of like a chocolate lava cake but far better than anything you'd get at Applebee's.   Fraisiers - delightful little sponge cakes, perfect for a sweet snack  Small macarons - So far, I've been 50/50 with the ones I've tried. I like the pink and purple ones.   Forget the name, but the pumpkin tart is easily the best tasting pumpkin dessert I've ever had.   Additionally, I'm not sure where they get their coffee, but it's very good. It never tastes burnt and is always fresh, and the flavor is wonderful.",

We've been wanting more, but it's difficult to get to. We saw the good reviews on yelp and thought we'd give this place a try since we were passing by.   The macarons lacked flavor to the point of it being hard to distinguish what flavor each was.   The pastries seemed to either be over or under baked. None were just right. Some tasted eggy and had a rawish center while others left an unpleasant burnt taste in our mouths.   Next time we want French pastries, we will make the drive to squirrel hill instead.",

La gourmadine did not disappoint. Their croissant was so flaky and buttery. The almond croissant did not look like a croissant but wow did it taste amazing. Every bite had flaky buttery almond goodness. The only thing I wasn't too impressed with was the spinach and goat cheese quiche. It was mediocre nothing special. The last thing I tried was the cream puff which was amazing. The cream was perfect not too thick or sweet and the pastry was perfect. Thank god I only bought one, I could have eaten four in one sitting.   Overall, a wonderful bakery in the south hills. Will definitely make an effort to return for their decadent pastries!",
