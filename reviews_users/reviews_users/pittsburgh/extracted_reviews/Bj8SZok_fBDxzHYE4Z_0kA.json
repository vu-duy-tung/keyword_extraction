    "text": "I tend to prefer this location of Thai Place because it is always so quiet.  The menu seems to be identical to that of the Walnut Street location.    All of the curry dishes are good here, as are some of the simpler dishes.  I especially like the Penang curry, and the sauce for the chicken with garlic is excellent.  They also include a lot of really good, fresh vegetables in all of their dishes, which, to me, is a plus.  While I haven't tried many of them, the chef's specials seem to be very original to the restaurant.   The service is always prompt and excellent.  The only drawback to that I can think of is that the prices are a bit high, compared to other Thai restaurants.  However, I always leave Thai Place feeling pleased and satisfied.",

The only difference between spicy or not spicy with how much extra hot red pepper flakes they would sprinkle on top of the pad Thai.  The service was absolutely terrible. The waitress just was too young and inexperienced.  Would not go back anytime soon",

OMG but the food was just so average.I've been to better Thai restaurants in the past. The pad thai was not good and that's what it should be!! The curries were very rich with vegetables but again weren't delicious. I have nothing against this place, but if you have had really good thai food in other places, then you have raised the bar and won't like this place. So if you're trying Thai food for the first time...don't hit this place. Sorry for being honest, but look, I'm really obsessed with Thai food and have tried most of the thai restaurants in Pittsburgh, and this restaurant is not going on my favorite list. I don't care how many awards they have hanging on they wall. Just not going back there. Who cares what I think though, everyone has a different taste. So you might like it, just not me:-/",

First of all, it should have never bee brought out that way, but there was no compensation for the extra time I had to wait for it to be remade. Today was the last straw. We waited an hour after we ordered to get our food. No one offered an explanation and when flagged down, was basically ignored. They did not offer to even discount our meal. I won't ever go back. Spend the extra dollar or two and go to Tai Pei, Ichiban, or Jimmy Wan's if your in the O'Hara area.",

It's a little difficult to get to on foot-- although there are crosswalks close to the restaurant, there is no easy sidewalk path so you'll be wandering a bit through grass and rocks. Despite the slight inconvenience, however, the breadth of the menu and flavoring is an absolute delight.   I ordered Mongolian beef (spice level 8 on a 0-10 scale) for around $14. As someone who enjoys spicy food a lot, a spice level of 8 was very mild. Next time I'll definitely order a spice level 10 to get a bit more kick. The dish was quite hefty-- I came home with leftovers for dinner the next night, so it's well worth the price! Despite being a beef dish, however, there was a large portion of mixed vegetables and a generous portion of sauce. It was a very well balanced dish, and I was super happy to give this restaurant a try!  The host was also the waiter, and seemed to be the main staff for the restaurant, which wasn't too busy at 7pm on a Saturday. He was very attentive and helpful.   Will definitely go back!",

They have ALOT of items on their menu, so there should be something for everyone. I tried the sweet and sour shrimp (steamed shrimp). They put their own Thai spin on the sweet and sour sauce. It was good and the portions were a good size. The service was good too; our waiter was very friendly.

It reminded me more of a sweet and spicy chili sauce as the base versus a peanut sauce. That being said it was still really good and I'd go back if I were craving that flavor combo again. However, my plus one had the panang curry and said it was some of the best they ever had. I have tried out quite a few Pittsburgh Thai restaurant where they would order the Panang curry and this one is their favorite. So I tried it as well. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, the chicken was very tender and the curry sauce was fully developed so I think a curry is your best bet here, or at least the panang for sure!   The service was great as well. So overall it was a great first experience!",

We walked in and were greeted by the hostess which turned out to be our waiter.  He said we could choose any table that we liked and we did.  We both ordered water and looked over the menu.  We have been in a wide noodle type of mood so that's what we looked for.  I got the Pad Se Ew and my wife got the Spicy Rice Noodles.  We also ordered their Fresh Spring Rolls for an appetizer.       The restaurant is nothing fancy just average decorations and furniture.  Our waiter was nice.  The menu wasn't too big either but it had what we were looking for.  It says they have a full bar and they do have a couple shelves of liquor but again nothing to fancy. Our Rolls came within 5 minutes and I liked them.  My wife thought they needed to have more mint and green things in the rolls (LOL) but it's actually just how I like it.  Their peanut sauce was a little sweet and we heard another customer complain about it.  The hot Thai sauce that we asked for was really good and went well with our rolls.         Our food came out and there was a lot of food on the plate.  I asked for chicken and it was good.  The flavor was tasty and I asked for a spice level of 7 and I thought it was spicy.  My wife and I usually agree on spice levels and she didn't think it was spicy.  My dish had a lot of vegetables in it which was good but they put water chestnuts in there and I'm not a big fan of that.  There were a lot too which made me not enjoy my food as much.  Also the noodles were skinny and not as good as some other Thai places we have been too.  I think it was average not bad but not great.  For the price of the food and the amount that we got I was still happy.",

    "text": "I stopped by here a couple of Saturdays ago with my wife for lunch.  We were at the Waterworks Mall whenever we became hungry and so thought that the Thai Place would be the perfect lunch spot for us.  We arrived to the restaurant at around 11:30 to find the place completely empty.  That certainly didn't seem good but we reasoned that it was still early.  During the entirety of our meal only a single other table ended up walking in.  Anyways the inside of the Thai Place consists of an almost comically small bar where the cash register is and then a rather large dining room.  We were given our choice of seats and my wife chose a booth near the back of the restaurant.  For my lunch entree on this day I wasn't able to find anything interesting which I was familiar with on the lunch menu and so I ended up trying something different.  So I ordered the Khao Man Gai while my wife went with the pad Thai from the regular menu.  The menu described my Khao Man Gai as tender juicy chicken, fragrant ginger and garlic flavored rice, served with a light chili dipping sauce.  However my request for a spice level 10 meant that the dipping sauce would be quite spicy.   I have to admit that whenever my dish came to the table that I was quite disappointed with how it looked.  The chicken was cooked plain and was sitting next to a white looking rice and a chili dipping sauce.  My first bite of the chicken plain didn't really help the matter as I found it was somewhat boring.  However the next bite I dipped in the sauce and man was that spicy and flavorful!  I proceeded to dip the rest of the chicken into the sauce and enjoy every bite of it.  Once I had finished the chicken I planned on eating maybe a 1/4 to 1/2 of the rice like I usually do.  However that garlic and ginger flavor that was in it was nice and I ended up eating all of it.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  While I didn't really expect much from this restaurant and food, especially after I first saw it, the food ended up being sneaky good and I really enjoyed my lunch here.",

    "text": "Not too bad. I had the chicken and broccoli as well as the Tom Yum Gai which I can never pass down at a Thai place the soup was pretty good. The Chicken and Broccoli could have been from any average \"Chinese\" place; nothing special; way too much undercooked broccoli for my own liking. The people however were fantastic!  I would go back just for the people!  I think the think with Thai restaurants is spice level. I got my meal to go. I asked for my spice level to be medium spicy..... I was expecting much more than I got and was disappointed. Each place is different and that is my fault; not theirs. The food was good; just not my favorite.",

    "text": "I was at the hospital and decided on Thai for lunch.  I was not impressed and a little let down.  I ordered the green Curry with chicken.  I asked the waiter what vegetables where in it and he really did not know and was reluctant to ask.  He said three times, \"it's a good mix\".  But I wanted to know what was in it.  I then asked if I could had Egg Plant added into it like many other Thai Restaurants have done and he told me that if I want egg plant I would have to order an egg plant dish.   Half way through my meal my drink still had not arrived, he was apologetic but he walked past me a million times since my table was next to the kitchen door and water station.   I order a spicy 5 out of 10 like normally but it seems to be about an 8 when trying to eat the curry.  At the end my bill never came although my CC was on the table waiting.  So I walked up to the register.   The food was mediocre and the service left much to be desired.  Th from receptionist seemed friendly but never offered me a fortune cookie like all other guest.   At the end I'm glad that their are other Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh like Nikki's Thai on the north side, Bangkok Balcony in Squirrel Hill and Thai Cottage in Regent Square.",

    "text": "Ordered take out a few times when I was visiting my friend who lives out this way. Most recently, we both ordered the lunch special with pad thai - one with chicken and one with tofu. The lunch deal came with a small portion of soup and a small veggie egg roll as well, which was awesome! I tried their wonton soup, which was super tasty and my friend loved her hot & sour soup. The egg roll was quite tasty as well! The pad thai was also really tasty and we were both given generous portions. I should also mention that pick up was a breeze- the staff was very friendly and it came out right on time AND they are open on Mondays, which is unlikely for a thai place, but also super convenient! Overall, I really enjoy this place & will most likely return again the next time I am out this way!",

They recently added some new items to their menu including their version of Pho. Different than most versions I've had but it was absolutely fantastic. Nice spicy broth, thick rice noodles and large chunks of chicken. No jalapenos but it was plenty spicy and had a large portion size.  They also have one of the better Thai iced teas that I've tried in Pittsburgh.",
