    "text": "Have eaten at other PF Chang's locations, and always pretty dependable, at least to be hot, somewhat spicy and flavorful, and fresh tasting.  And service is usually professional.  But I got takeout at this PFC and the two people at the front counter ignored me, then when they engaged me, they found my food, but did nothing.  Apparently someone else had to ring me up.  I had gotten salt and pepper calamari for an appetizer, and sesame chicken for an entree.  The calamari was cold, and they give you a small container of salt mixed with pepper to season it yourself, with a forgettable sweet sauce.  Not exciting.  And it seems to me that sesame chicken is a layup for a chinese restaurant - tough to screw up - but Chang's did - it was not flavorful, the chicken was dry and the vegetables (broccoli and peppers) were soggy.  it was all edible, but there are two are three cheap chinese restaurants nearby who would do just as well for a lot less money, and they'll be friendly too.  PFC was off their game tonight, or at least at this location!",

Bad service and OK food was the beginning. I then saw the staff clear glasses from tables and bring them back to the bartender. The bartender had a sink full of soapy water and a sink with just water in it. He would take the glasses 2 or 3 at a time and partially dip them in the soapy water and then partially dip them in the rinse water and then put them in what appeared to be the freezer/cooler. I was disgusted that they were not thoroughly washed and sanitized. I brought this to the attention of the server that didn't seem to care. I then emailed the corp office about it and asked if this was procedure at all locations. I never received a response. I definitely will never go back to that location and doubt I will go back to any PF Changs.",

Tried going last Saturday and the wait was 2 hours.  That is outrageous.  So the following Saturday still wanting to use the gift card, we made reservations.  We were seated on time at 8.  (FYI, the wait without reservations was 1.5 hours).    We were completely unimpressed with the food.  I couldn't even finish my Sesame chicken, it was just not good.   The flavor was kind of strange, and not spicy as described. The portions were EXTREMELY small.    I'm shocked that this place is so busy given the poor quality of food.  I will never go back.    My favorite Chinese place in Pittsburgh is Sesame Inn.  They put PF Chang's to shame.  Everything on their menu is absolutely delicious, portions are generous and I've never waited more than 10 mins for a table.",

Problem was the food took about 30 minutes. The manager delivered our food and did apologize. We asked why the food took so long and her response was that they were busy. She came back to the table with an attitude and said she took our appetizer off and then proceeded to show me a time stamp of the order process and said it was only 26 minutes. I was shocked. I told her that I am a restaurant manager and I would never bring a time ticket to a table and argue with a guest. She then asked me if I was going to cause a scene. At that point, I just wanted to get out of there. We had 2 bites of food at that point. After I asked the manager for her card, she rolled her eyes and walked away. She then came back and comped the meal, which I was not looking for. This was the second bad experience at this location in 3 years. With management like that, they will never see me again!",

I checked out the new location at Settler's Ridge on a Saturday afternoon. At 3pm they had a 30-40 minute wait (I told you, people love this place...) but luckily we found a seat in the bar area immediately.   We ordered from the small selection of lunch bowls, available until 4pm. I got the \"Asian\" grilled salmon bowl, which was around $8 and comes with egg drop or hot and sour soup. I started with egg drop soup, which was pretty good and not all broth. As for the salmon, the portion was small but reasonable for a lunch size. The salmon was cooked very well, but was totally lacking in flavor or seasoning, so I had to douse it in the variety of oils they provide on the table. My mom's sesame chicken bowl was equally uninteresting and just lacking in flavor all around.  I can see how the decor and environment would appeal to most, and I can see how the bland food would appeal to the large number of people who can't handle actual, real live ethnic food. But it's just not for me.",

    "text": "Lettuce Wraps.  They come from all over for the lettuce wraps, and Chinese food.  The crowds are a-plenty at PF Chang's.  If you plan on coming during the weekend, make a reservation, or you could be in for a long wait.  What makes PF Chang's the most successful and highest grossing restaurant at the Waterfront?  Several things.  Firstly, the service is close to impeccable. When you walk in the door, a hostess smiles, and takes your name.  They're cordial, sincere, and capable.  If you have a special need, or require special service, they can make it happen without running to a manager.  Once seated, your server will take your drink order, and more importantly, will let you know if they're going to be a few minutes by saying, \"I'll be right with you.\"  I've always been amazed with the efficiency in which this restaurant operates.  Place your order, and the meal (or appetizer) usually appears within 15 minutes, if not sooner.  The cooks in the kitchen know their craft, and know it well.  Another key ingredient in PF's success is consistency.  Every time I've had the pleasure of eating there, my food always looks, and tastes the same; no variations.  I always start with Chang's Chicken Lettuce Wraps and it seems as if they've counted out the exact amount of lettuce and chicken every time; consistency is good. The chicken, Chinese noodles and special sauce make for a good combination; crunchy and sweet.  After the appetizer I most always have the Crispy Honey Chicken, or the Kung Pao.  I usually ask for some extra heat; I like the spice!   The chicken is tender and flavorful, never over-cooked.  I've also tried the Mongolian Beef, and Beef with Broccoli- both superb.  If you're a vegetarian, they can make you a dish of Coconut Curry Vegetables, or Ma Po Tofu.  If you happen to be gluten-free, try some Singapore Street Noodles (made with rice), or GF Buddha's Feast, a varied selection of seasonal vegetables.   If you're at PF Chang's on a Friday or Saturday night and don't have reservations, grab a drink at the bar.  There are always plenty of people to talk to, and you might just find a seat.  If you don't have time to order an entree try the lettuce wraps, you'll be happy you did.",

    "text": "I've never dined in at this location but have ordered takeout.  On a recent takeout experience on a Saturday night, as I stood there waiting to pick up my order and pay I wondered why am I a patron of this sub-par Chinese chain...and why can't they implement a better takeout process, especially on a busy evening.    Let's start with the takeout process, calling in and placing your order is all fine and dandy but it's when you have to pick up your food that the staff must have major operational deficiencies not to realize there's a better way to do this.  I went to pick up my order on a busy Saturday evening to find the place, well busy!  I saw loads of people waiting to be seated and internally had a sigh of relief knowing that I was just paying and picking up my order and would be on my way fairly quickly.    WRONG!  What started out as a sigh of relief transitioned into gasps of air and silent meditation trying not to freak out about the idiocy of the pick up process.  It appears that they have two sets of staff - one set to handle the dine-in customers and one set to handle the takeout customers.  I want to highlight that when I say set of staff there is more than one, often 2-3 staff members clogging up what could be a more efficient process  I'm waiting to pay and pick up my order only to be at the back of 4 customers placing take out orders.  Let me paint a picture of what's happening, 4 people in front of me each placing a ginormous order while one staff member takes the order for these customers and the other takeout staff members (2 others) stand nearby intently listening but doing absolutely nothing.  Ummm...hi, I'm over here just wanting to pay and pick up my order which I can see on the counter.    I'm so confused, there are like 4 cash registers and about a million staff members but only one staff member for all takeout issues regardless of whether you're placing the order or picking up.  Note to PF Chang's why don't you have one staff member or create another set of staff members to solely handle the payment/pick-up portion?!?!    This may have marginally increased the star rating but at the end of the day the food is also NOT good.  I ordered the sesame chicken which claims to be a spicy dish but my taste buds could only taste sweetness and a sad attempt at cooking Chinese food for the masses.    Do yourself a favor and just don't go here...dine in or take out!",

The waterfront location seems more open, but way too open if you understand my meaning. This location has a separate bar area and dining room. Also, the dining room at the waterfront has way to many lighting fixtures with too many different types of lamp shades, one of the bad decorating choices of the first decade of the twenty-first century. The Settler's Ridge location has three huge acorn shaped chandeliers suspended above the dining room, very chic!  The food is always good, and if you're a practicing vegan like myself, Chang's offers many options. This day I sat at the bar and watched as CNN reported on the death of Osama Bin Laden (USA! USA! Rot in Hell you %#^*#+) and ordered the steamed vegetable dumplings. Six to an order and the perfect light lunch. I also could have ordered the steam \"fried\" brown rice or the famous lettuce wraps made with soy instead of chicken. They also have eggplant and garlic and stringbeans sauteed with garlic. I wasn't a big fan of Chang's until the new location came at Settler's Ridge. But I am now!",

    "text": "I should predicate this review with a little background.  I've visited this P.F. Changs probably 6 times over the past three years.  It's usually because there are enough people at work who want to go that we all go.  I found something on the menu that I liked and I stuck with it.  Prior visits were unspectacular, but once I found \"Dan Dan Noodles\" I was set.  At least I was until the visit before my most recent visit.  They were bland in an ironic sort of extremely salty way.  Do you know what I mean?  I mean, it's hard to say that something that tastes like it just came out of a salt shaker is bland, but if that's the ONLY taste it has, then that's what my last order of Dan Dan Noodles tasted like.  THIS time, I resolved to find something new to replace Dan Dan Noodles (can you tell I like saying Dan Dan Noodles?  Because I do) for future visits.  Meh.  I'm done with PF Changs, at least lunch and dinner (because I still have a free happy hour dim sum for checking in on Yelp!).    I ordered the Kung Pao chicken and found the Kung lacking and also no Pao.  What they did NOT leave out, however, was the salt.  Holy crap!  The waitress (good waitress) gave me a replacement Mr. Pibb, suggesting I'd need it to finish my Kung Pao (presumably because it would be so spicy)...and I did need it.  But just to wash down the salt.  It was like I ordered a salt lick with a side of ...I'm not sure what...some sort of cold vinegar preparation of sliced vegetables.  I was stuck as to whether they were pairing pseudo-kim che with my faux chinese food.  Regardless it was not awesome.  I'm not kidding when I say the most enjoyable part of the meal was the fried rice, which is not to say that the fried rice was good...it just wasn't as awful as everything else.  People like this place, and I don't want my review to sway them away, but it was not good.  The atmosphere is great, the wait staff was quick and efficient...but the food is expensive and not good.",

    "text": "I was already wary going in given the fact that this \"Chinese Restaurant\" was staffed primarily by white college aged kids from the area, but I was willing to give it a shot. I couldn't have been more disappointed.  Walking in, the restaurant has a classy, upscale look to it, although to be honest the place looked more like a hotel lobby than a restaurant. After finally getting the attention of one of the 4 hostesses (who were all too busy talking amongst themselves to notice us), we were told the wait would be 45 minutes, which wasn't too bad given how busy I was told this place can get. I was hoping the long wait was a sign that the food here was really good, but apparently that was flawed logic.  Once we were seated, we got our menus and I wasn't too surprised by the pricing (I had been told this was more towards the expensive end), but what did surprise me were the portion sizes once the food finally came. Even the drinks were tiny. My wife ordered a $9 cocktail and finished it in two gulps. I'm just glad I couldn't make up my mind when the waitress took our drink order or I would have been in the same boat.  When the food came, I was shocked at little of it there was. Aren't Chinese restaurants kind of known for giving out large portions? Not here. The portions were meager, and so was the flavoring. I have never tasted such bland food before in my life. The dish I got was marked as being spicy but it certainly didn't taste that way.  What a huge let down. I can not for the life of me understand why this restaurant is so popular. It's a real shame. If you are looking for a Chinese restaurant in the area, do yourself a favor and visit Ya Fei in Robinson Town Center. The food tastes a million times better, the portions age huge, and you will never wait more than 2 minutes for a seat.",

Before I could shut my door, a young man was heading towards me with a bag of food. I was impressed with the speed, but thought that had I been on time, my food would not have been nearly as hot.  When I got home and we took the food out, I was shocked to see such small portions, due to the money I just shelled out!!!  The lo mein was adequate, the (orange, or something like it) chicken was vwry tasty, and the lettuce wraps are very good.   All in all the food was decent,  but the value is no where to be seen.   Don't think we will be back.",

Shrimp with lobster sauce is my favorite as are the lettuce wraps, ribs, and chocolate cake. share the cake though because portion is insanely big, I wish they would offer smaller dessert portions for cheaper price. It's also much healthier to do that. For this reason they get 4 stars. Otherwise there are many healthy options eg. Brown rice, less oil if you ask, gluten free if that's your thing etc. the grilled salmon is also amazing. I had one issue in all the times I've eaten here (rice not fully cooked so it was crunchy) and they completely apologized, made a new meal(I didn't pay for it) and offered us dessert. That is customer service! If you've not been here try it. They have traditional meals and some with a twist.",

    "text": "P.F Changs will ALWAYS get 5 stars from me, especially the one in Robinson. It is EXTREMELY clean. Huge, and ALWAYS has very pleasant waiters/waitresses/hostesses. Lettuce wraps were AMAZING like always. Although that is probably the most common appetizer and everyone will probably say its the best, im here to disagree! I think the Pan Fried Shrimp Dumplings are the best. There are only a few in each order though, but they are to DIE for. I would like these to be buried with me in my grave :)  The last time i was there we had the Sesame chicken, The Wok Seared Lamb and the VIP Duck.   The sesame chicken was pretty good, but it was pretty normal. Not up to par with some of the other things i have had from there. I dont care for lamb too much, but PF Changs was actually alright, it was pretty tastey. The duck was a miss though, just too interesting of a taste. Im not sure but i wasnt SUPER happy with it.  But other things ive gotten that i love from there areeee  Chang Shrimp Chang Chicken Mongolian Beef!! Sweet And Sour Chicken Kung Pao Chicken (best kung Pao Chicken ive ever had. Period) Kung Pao Shrimp (Like the chicken, best kung pao shrimp ive EVER had) Beef and Brocolli Orange Peel Shrimp Orange Peel Chicken  You cant take stars away because of just a few dishes, so in my opinion its deserving of 5 stars certainely!!  The shooters (deserts) that you can get are very good also.  Be careful when going to either the PF Changs in the Waterfront, or Settlers ridge, if you dont go at an awkward time 2-5 you will be waiting sometimes, more often at the waterfront one because the settlers ridge one is pretty large.  There curbside service IS pretty awesome though also!  Also i have much respect for ANY establishment that has a gluten-free menu because one of my best friends growing up had syliacs disease.",

For the main course, the safest bet would be PF Changs fried rice. Dan dan noodles are savory too.   Service is courteous and relaxed ambiance. Perfect for dinner after a movie at nearby Cinemax.",

For example, the wonton soup- it has shrimp, chicken, spinach, AND wontons. If you are hesitant because it is maybe not priced like a regular Chinese restaurant, this is because it is unbelievable quality and design. I got the boom boom shrimp as my dinner as well. It technically is the \"crispy honey shrimp\" but we were able to substitute it for the boom boom, which is a firecracker type flavor. They offer it in appetizer size as well. Our server, Cody, was so sweet and VERY attentive. I have never been here with a sever who seemed u knowledgable or lazy. Cody added immensely to my mother and I's experience this afternoon!   Will be coming back as usual!!! If you have never been here you MUST give it a try!!! It won't disappoint! :)",

I've held off on a review for years but considering my last 3 visits have been horrible, it's time to call it quits.  One of my go-to's has always been the chicken lettuce wraps. I'm not 100% sure how they are prepared, but someone needs to teach the cooks how to remove tendons from the meat. Nothing ruins the meal quicker then that ONE bite that is inedible.  Service during these three visits has been forgettable as well, especially during the lunch crowd.  Only saving grace for them is their deep fried banana dessert. Otherwise, stick to your local Chinese takeout place.",

So I arrived 25 min eary, just to see what would happen. Food was ready?? So would my food have sat for 25 more min? Would you have given me food cooked a half hour ago?  Asked about this pick up issue, and the lady said:  Me: \"what if I had come at my time? Would my love mein and soup have been cold? Or remade?\"   PF: \" we gave you a spoon for your soup.\"  Me: \"yeah, I've had soup before but what about the  discrepancy in time.\"  PF: \"I don't know, do you want a copy of your receipt?\"  Me: \"yes\"  PF: \" ok, make sure you total out the receipt here and sign here\"  Me: \"really?\"   In my head : \"This isn't my first time using a credit card.

We asked for a booth, since all were full, we had about a 10 minute wait.  But the host desk is very efficient and when a booth became available, they got it ready right away.  One of the things we like is the sauce they give you and like that you can pour on the heat, if need be.  Beer choices are a bit limited, but BJ is always able to find something he likes.  For our meals, I got one of the winter appetizers.  The Chili Shrimp Bao is 3 little warm pillows folded and filled with bibb lettuce, chili-shrimp, daikon, carrots and cucumber with tamarind-chili.  This dish is fairly small, but a good dish, if you are counting calories.  It comes in at 550 calories and that works for me.  BJ got pad thai which was served with rice noodles and a side of brown rice.  Very good.  Service here is always friendly and I love the interior design of the restaurant.",

Flavorful, not over-sauced, good portions, etc. The salt and pepper calamari is wonderful (especially the dipping sauce!) as well as the Mongolian beef. Unfortunately, the service at this location is really hit-or-miss...usually a miss. Lots of empty drinks, long waits and attitudes. The waterfront location, although always super busy, has much better odds for good service and is worth a visit for sure!",

It did have shrimp, water chestnuts, and clumps of chicken in it along with 2 wontons but like I said lacked any actual flavor.  The Summer rolls were better. They serve them cut in half which makes stuff fall out. I'd rather them keep it a solid roll. The chicken inside was too dry for the roll so I picked some of it out. The sauce it came with was good but filllled with sesame seeds. I liked some seeds but ended up scooping forkfuls of seeds out of the sauce. Way too much.  Also the prices are higher for what you're getting. The food looks good but is disappointing.  I'll eat here again (to use the rest of my gift card) then probably won't come back. There are much better options out there and at better prices.",

I've never sat in the main dining area - opting for the bar seating every time - but I've never had a bad experience at this location.   As Faith A. said below, Stephanie is an incredible bartender/server. I can't actually speak to her bartending skills, but her server skills are excellent! She was incredibly observant when the sun was bothering my wife's eyes as the sunset reflected off of the mirror behind the bar. Without even asking, she recognized the issue and closed the curtains on the opposite side of the bar. Add to that her ability to keep up with my rapid consumption of their iced tea and a pleasant attitude, and you're looking at a great server!  As with any P.F. location, get there early or you'll likely be waiting forever...or do as we do, and take a seat at the bar or at one of the first-come-first-serve tables in the bar area. If you're lucky, you'll get Stephanie as your waitress. Enjoy!",

I had the unfortunate experience to eat here last night and from the ineptitude of the host staff, who could not keep any resemblance of order, and sat parties without a reservation ahead of parties waiting over 45 minutes.  When my party was seated after waiting 50 minutes I was told your booth has been ready for 20 minutes, but no one told us.  Whose fault is this?   The manager.    I could go on and on about the negatives, but I don't care enough.  So, I will just say, for the franchise or the corporate owner, take a hard look at who you are entrusting the day to day activities to.",

I mean I didn't taste anything that would grant the prices being higher than any other Chinese restaurant. I would say basic chain Chinese food. Good, but nothing I would go back for.   We the spicy tuna roll, which basically was a ton of rice and a little tuna, but tasted good. And for entrees we had the new street noodle and the honey chicken. The street noodle has good flavor but the tomato threw me off. And I don't think the noodle was quite a rice noodle. Tasted more like angel hair pasta to me.  I probably would only go back if i just happened to end up here with others, not by choice.",

We were orginally going to get takeout, but then decided to eat there instead.  It was a Sunday evening and we were seating right away. My dad and I ordered a drink and then ordered the seasame chicken entree and the honey chicken entree.  Honestly, I thought it was very good and the portion size was just right.  I was expecting some commericalized chinese food that would taste subpar, but that was not the case. I was shocked that it tasted so good and I think I will have to check out the location near my house in the near future.  THe place was clean and the service was very good, but overall the menu items are expensive.  For a basic combo meal without an egg roll I thought the meal total was expensive for just two people.  I can go to local chinese resturatns and get bigger portions for a cheaper price and that is the one downfall of this place.  If money really isn't a factor though, you won't be disspaointed with the food here.",

My girlfriend and I decided to opt for the dinner for two which included a choice of soup, eggrolls, entree, and dessert.  We opted for the Won Ton soup which turned out to have shrimp in it.I was okay with that since i am a shrimp lover but was surprised to find it in my soup. Still it was good. We got two eggrolls apiece. All we had at the time were forks and knives there was no serving soup for the duck sauce.  When I had finished my first eggroll the waitress was taking away my plate. I told her I wanted to eat the second one later. She said that I could put it on my main course plate that was lying there. Not really what I wanted so I opted instead to take it home with me.  My girlfriend had the sesame chicken which she let me try. I found it to be very good. I had the moo goo gai pan which I thought was somewhat bland. You get a choice of brown or white rice to accompany it.  The dessert we choose to share was raspberry chocolate crepe. We were given a couple of fortune cookies in advance but when we got this dessert the chocolate was scribbled on the dish and two crepes were laying on top of it with powdered sugar. They seemed kind of tough for us to eat.  Again we had to ask for a separate plate and we had no knife to cut it with. We did have a nice waitress but without proper utensils it is a bit harder to enjoy the meal. Course there are plenty of chopsticks in paper wrap but we never use them.  The restaurant wasn't overly busy since we arrived before the dinner hour so we didn't have to wait that long to be served. It is fairly dark inside so it makes it a little hard to see things.  We will probably visit here again when the occasion warrants it but will probably try ala carte next time.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that while the food isn't bad it's the service that makes this place worth going to.   I just landed back in Pittsburgh and my mother wanted to do an early dinner after I got to the hotel. We went straight to this place, a spot we'd been to before, with the intention of trying their four course prix fixe menu.   Started with egg drop soup, which is neither good or bad. Personally, I'd go for plain old miso and be happy. Next was appetizers, chicken lettuce wraps plus the pork dumplings on as extra. The lettuce wraps are a guaranteed hit for me, the pork dumplings were just okay. I'd have to try them again to be sure. They were skimpy with the lettuce, but the waitress brought us more lettuce without us having to ask. My main course was the the Asian grilled salmon. Huge piece of salmon with asparagus. The salmon was tender and absolutely delicious. Dessert for me was the salted caramel cake. Discovered this gem when I went to PF Changs in Monterey and I'm hooked.    The waitress made this visit for me. Mom wasn't sure she wanted soup so the waitress brought her out the egg drop and the hot & sour soup (she didn't like either). I got a pink cherry Cosmo (hated it), she saw I didn't like it so she added sprite and made it taste so much better. She was quick, thoughtful, knowledgeable about the menu, and friendly. We tipped the 20%, but I wish I'd have tipped her more. Food was good, but she made the visit better.",

The past 3 times have been disasters and there are just too many restaurants to keep putting myself through the annoyance of eating here.  Largely the problem here was service in the restaurant.  Our drinks at the bar were perfect and the bartender was efficient and made good drinks.  The dining room was another story.  We sat for 12 minutes before our server even approached the table.   He very quickly took our drink order and brought the bottles of wine.   We ordered appetizers and entrees.     One appetizer came out after a short while, and he explained that they burned the other one and were making a new one.   So now one couple is eating and the other is waiting.  They asked for a sauce for their appetizer and it never came.    Finally when he brought the other appetizer they reminded him and it came after they were done eating.   We ordered 2 items to share and asked for plates.  We sat and sat waiting for him to bring plates.   The food was scant.  We had Kung Pao chicken and chicken lo mein.  No leftovers because there wasn't much food to begin with.   Our friends were underwhelmed with their meals as well.  The restaurant was not crowded on a Friday night and now I know why.",

We went with the usual lettuce wraps, pork dumplings, spicy green beans side, and pork egg rolls. Everything was absolutely delicious. I also got a pear mojito and a glass of sangria.

I ordered a glass of water without ice cuz my throat can't take ice, my husband got ice tea. Then i saw the sign on the table that $3 banana spring roll and $3 refresher for Tuesday(today)special (cuz i didn't wanna look into the 4 menu they gave each of us just yet). This is our first time here, so i and my husband didn't know much about the menu at all but i wish the server would be nicer to answer the question instead of showing face responding \"that's dessert\" like we should know better before asking what are those. Then we asked about a drink in the picture without the name under it and she said it's in the menu. i had to ask again to know where it was to know the price and description. Then she said it's plum wine(the bottle was in japanese in the picture) then we found it at the bottom of the menu. i ordered it. Then she walked to the next table, rolling her eyes. We walked out after that. I've never felt so unwelcomed, and disrespected, same as my husband. I'm a hostess and serve at a restaurant too. i know we should have explained to the hotess and asked to talk to the manager before walking out like that but my husband wouldn't like to explain anything since the restaurant looked kinda upscale, very nice, very well organized and the menu looked clean and new, so much better than a regular restaurant and we were treated like that? We were seated at the first table to the left, next to the hostess station. The table was kinda big for 2 and the cushion looked little old and dirty comparing to everything else. We went to the Walnut Grill after that and received quite different experience:at least the server made us feel more welcome, explained everything in the menu patiently and pleasantly. We didn't have to ask anything to receive such an attitude.  I'm very sorry for walking out like that after ordering the wine. That was my first time ever doing that. It felt wrong but you can't just seat there and hope for a better service when it already started bad.",

At that point, we had arrived at the restaurant and ordered inside. We were told 20-25 minutes. We left and came back 25 minutes later and were told 20-25 more minutes due to the volume of to-go orders. This is something that should have been brought to our attention when initially ordering as we could have decided to go to another place very similar in the same plaza.

They have a wide selection of food and drinks, and a lighter menu with smaller portions for lunch. This location has outdoor seating, which is always a plus in my book. The service outside is a little slow though. As for the food, you can't go wrong with the lettuce wraps. They are delicious. I'd also recommend the lobster avocado roll or Chang's spicy Chicken. The portions are very large. My last visit here, I got the Thai Harvest Curry. I didn't love it, but it was okay. The flavors were great, but the vegetables were way under cooked and hard. I am not sure I'd order that again. If you've never tried a PF Changs, I'd give it a shot.",

    "text": "I was spending an evening alone and wanted a good dinner, so I came here. Since I was dining alone I wasn't that concerned with the ambience. I just wanted the food to be good. Well, mission NOT accomplished. The entire meal left me feeling kind of 'bleh'.  The tempura on the calamari and vegetables was nice. The calamari was good and tender, except there were several instances where there were big clumps of everything stuck together and the inside didn't get cooked fully; so it was kind of wet and doughy.   I especially liked the calamari and the spinach, but I didn't like the fact that the skin on the red pepper was left in my mouth after I had chewed everything else up. (Sorry, I'm a texture person ). And I could've done without the carrots. They didn't do anything to help the dish.   The Hokkein Street Noodles had a lot going on. The entree consists of thin rice noodles along with cherry tomatoes, huge strips of scallion tops, bean sprouts, huge pieces of raw onions, some type of cabbage, eggs and these little crunchy brown things...but I don't know what they were. The chicken and shrimp were both very tender, and I made sure that I ate all of them so I would feel like I got my money's worth.   I could've lived with all of the things in the dish, but that sauce...OH MY YUCK!   It was supposed to be a light curry sauce,  but it tasted like salad dressing and had a slightly sweet taste to it. I guess this was a really big turn-off for me personally, because I don't like sweet and savory tastes together. If you're someone who doesn't mind that, then you would probably like the dish. I had to balance it out with some soy sauce to try to tamp down the sweetness. That's the only thing that made this palatable for me.   My server, Anthony, was extremely nice, very attentive and efficient. I didn't have the heart to tell him that I hated what I ordered.   I really like PF Chang's and on this visit, I decided to take a break from the norm and go out into uncharted waters. Well guess what? I won't be doing THAT again! I'm gonna swim my little butt RIGHT back to the shore and stick with what I know!",

It was another 25 minutes for an appetizer, and I left after another 30 minutes without receiving main dish. They weren't busy and waitress was horribly inattentive to the patrons.

I'm a huge fan of PF Chang's simply because the food is affordable, the food has got a certain kick to it and also the grandeur of the restaurant itself but unfortunately all was not well at this location.  The restaurant - looks big and grand from the outside with the typical horse but is just a big barn on the inside - does not give you the same feel like the others that I have visited in the last 4 years . The washrooms were quite dirty - just had to mention this ! We were probably the only ones for dinner at 8:45 PM on a Thursday night - so I'm guessing this isn't a popular choice with the late diners . The drinks were great - always enjoy the whiskey sour here - near perfect ! The lettuce wraps which I never miss at PF Chang's were a miss - the lettuce itself felt cold and hard and the crispy wafers were not provided on the side but mixed with the chicken . The shrimp in lobster sauce was just terrible - it was cold and bland - so unlike PF Chang's. But then everything served seemed to be cold - whereas it should be served as soon as it's off the wok - we enjoy our food when it's piping hot . The shrimp on the lo mein (forget the name of the dish) were great and the black pepper chicken was decent . The mini deserts just about average as well . So not so impressed with this PF Chang's - as a PF Chang lover might give the other location in Pittsburgh a shot .",

You also don't get soup or egg roll or fried rice so have to pay extra for each. Service and atmosphere has always been good.",

    "text": "So, not sure why the manager decided to tell me that this is how they always serve the Mongolian Beef, as my myriad prior dining experiences at this restaurant beg to differ. What's super funny is that I didn't want a replacement or compensation for this dish. All I wanted was to bring it to their attention so that the kitchen could get it together. And yet, Ms. Manager thought that trying to snow me was the way to handle this situation. My favorite part was that after she told me that this many scallions (it's seriously like someone went to the Giant Eagle next door, grabbed a handful of scallions, came back to the kitchen, and cut all of them directly into my plate... like, they weren't even sauteed) are ALWAYS included in this dish, she then said that she didn't see my plate before it went out of the kitchen. Which tells me that the scallion to beef ratio was, in fact, way off base.   I'm not sure if this is supposed to be some bizarre cost-cutting measure or what, but how is a real live human expected to digest all of these? As you peruse my photos (I've included a picture of the dish from their website as well, for the sake of comparison), please keep in mind that I had already eaten a fair amount of said scallions.  This isn't really about scallions. It's about customer service and accountability. This restaurant evidently has neither. As a result, I won't be back. Which is sad because I love the chicken lettuce wraps and the Mongolian Beef, minus about 75% of the scallions I was served tonight.",

There were old dirty swiffers that the staff used to clean the floor perched in the corners on full display. I wouldn't return because of the smell and floors. The waterworks location is much older and much cleaner.",
