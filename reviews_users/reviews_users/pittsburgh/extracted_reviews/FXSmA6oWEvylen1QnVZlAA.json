    "text": "You really can't spend more than a few days in this city without hearing about Pamela's.  I was told it had decent food at a good price, but was really over hyped.  The new location has apparently also improved the food.  Now don't get me wrong; this place is a through and through American as apple pie type breakfast joint.  I feel like calling it a greasy spoon is really doing it a disservice.   The pancakes are great, the eggs perfectly fluffy and the meat is neither too salty nor overcooked.  On multiple occasions  the food has been consistent, quick and plentiful.  The portions are in no way small.  They aren't huge but they are more than any normal human should eat in one sitting.    Do you want a great all-American breakfast at a great price that is in no way greasy?  Pamela's is your best bet.  Cash only!",

    "text": "I live half a block from this new Pamela's location....which means I lived about 1 block from the old location.  I never went to the old location - just too far away I guess - but now that they're a cozy 1/2 block down the street, I summoned the energy to pay them a visit.  Ha, no, I'm not that lazy.  Honestly it was the outdoor tables that sold me about this location - and the fact that it's summer.  I figured we'd be waiting for a table, and who wants to wait in the snow?  Actually, at 11 on a Sunday, four of us got a table within about 15 minutes, so that's not bad at all.  We got a patio table too, which was great for people watching.  I know this is blasphemous, but none of us wanted pancakes.  I know!  Everything I read in the reviews beforehand was a rave about the glorious hotcakes.  I'm sure they are delicious, I just truly cannot eat a whole plateful of sweet dessert-esque breakfast.  Maybe if I come again with my boyfriend, he will get the pancakes and I can try them.   Instead, I got the corned beef hash.  The savory dishes were all pretty heavy and a little greasy, but honestly pretty good.  I enjoyed the salty meat, the abundant potatoes, and the well-cooked eggs.  The wheat toast was hilariously DROWNED in butter...which was kind of delicious.  But it was funny in its excess.  This food is all about excess, mainly in calorie form.  I couldn't finish it, but I usually can't finish my food, so that's not unusual.  The price was right - about $6.95 for a very big breakfast.  Service is quick and inattentive - don't bother waiting for your server to refill your water glass, you will need to flag someone down.  But we lingered a bit over coffee and nobody hassled us or tried to make us leave, so that was nice.  I'd come back - it's right across the street - but I honestly find the menu limiting.  Basically, go if you want pancakes or omelets.  The breakfast options besides those are limited.  I'd enjoy a wider variety of savory breakfast options, but frankly the food is so cheap, I'm happy to have whatever they're offering.  It's filling and satisfying, and decadent in its high-cal glory.",

    "text": "Ahhh, that was a tasty meal. My blood pressure's up a little bit from the corned beef hash, but it was exactly as hash should be: hot, crumbly, salty, and crispy. Admittedly, I did request it extra crusty, because most places don't take the time to let the crust develop in their frenzied rush to serve the crowd of folks waiting impatiently outside. How would it have been cooked if I hadn't requested it that way? Who knows. But props for entertaining my request and cooking it right. The eggs were over easy as ordered, the orange juice was ice cold, and the price was right.  A few constructive comments: Cash only sucks in this day and age, especially when I can't keep track of what I spend my money on unless it's captured on my credit card statement. To the hostess, if you choose to sit me down at a table that still has dirty dishes on it, make sure to have it wiped down. Sure it was mostly clean, but there was a tiny puddle of coffee from the previous diner--kinda gross. Also, it took a smidge longer than one might expect for the waitress to come around, but when I flagged her down she was more than happy to take my order.  Lastly, the overall wait for a table wasn't too bad: I would say maybe 15 minutes mid-morning on a beautiful Sunday in September. Isn't that primo brunching time? Although, with the Steelers playing at home, I'm guessing a large chunk of their usual crowd was probably tailgating...",

Our food came out SUPER fast. I mean like LIGHTNING. Our friends were really impressed, which makes us look good. The new interior is adorable, still retaining the retro kitsch everyone loves. Probably the best experience I've had at any Pamela's so far!  My only peeve with Pamela's is their bacon. It's not that good. It's too thin and skimpy and tastes like that microwaveable, pre-cooked bacon you get at the grocery store. I wish they would upgrade to some nice thick pepper bacon or something.  STILL cash only.",

    "text": "This is a mixed review.   We were pleased to see that the OG Pamela's had spread it's wings and moved to a bigger location. Since our fair President had visited Pamela's (and made her pancake recipe a White House staple- holla!) this modest chain has gained much more popularity it seems- even though there were always lines around the block to get in.  Pat and I elected to sit outside, even though it was rainy and humid. On the far wall there is a bunch of old Pamela's memorabilia, but the patio are was super cramped, and felt kind of generic. My rear end brushed against the table next to me and my eyes met the glare of a not so pleased diner (not that u can blame her- I was in workout gear and this was a post-workout brunch).   The service was prompt and friendly. I ordered the Spinich and Feta omelette, with a side of pancakes (oh course!) and it seemed that somewhere between the trek \"upstreet\" the size of the omelette had shrunk. The pancakes were as delish a ever though.  I don't know- I would come again but would elect to sit inside next time. The vibe seemed a lot more authentic in there, with much more elbow room.  Ps. Glaring girl, if you are reading this, sorry 'bout that.  Pss. Cute blonde waitress who thought I was a dude and kept calling me a \"him\", it's all good. I've been called worse. ;)",

I still don't like that, but it doesn't hold me back from giving this place five stars, mainly because it's that good.  If this is your first time to a Pamela's, by all means get the pancakes.  They don't make 'em like this anywhere else.  The lyonnaise potatoes are also really amazing.  Recently, all I ever order is the blueberry stuffed pancakes - again, I could nitpick, and say I wish the blueberries weren't as cold as they are, but again - those pancakes.  As far as this particular location goes, it's the newest, and much larger than the old location.  They give you carafes of coffee at your table, and the mugs themselves are no longer those chintzy little plastic things, but solid ceramic.  Things like that matter.",

    "text": "Awesome, yet crowded, and slightly overrated. I grew up in Pittsburgh and I could pretty much walk to their previous location (not too far down the street, on Forbes) and I oftentimes did, with my mom. Their strawberry hotcakes are more like crispy crepes with a slight dose of brown sugar, sour cream, and awesomely warm strawberry topping + whipped cream. Unffff. So good. Crispity yet soft. Salty, yet sweet. I am starting to drool just typing this. I want to go back, but alas, I am in St. Louis. Overrated because the place is always freaking packed so you expect a 5 star experience, when in reality, it's only a 4. (In my book at least.) The staff can be pushy sometimes. They were telling people to \"go wait outside\" in the freeze-ass cold. Yes, I get that they need room to move around, but it seems a little harsh to say that. Why not just turn on (MORE) heaters outside and/or enclose the area somehow? I dunno. Seemed a little cruel. Thankfully there's pretty rapid turnover and we only had to wait about 15 min for our party of 3. Ran into old friends there. Man, I miss home!!",

We had two different waitresses for order and food delivery.  The ordering waitress was perfunctory and spared no pleasantries to the point that it exuded rudeness.  The waitress that delivered our food was very pleasant but we only saw her for a couple seconds during delivery.  We ate our food, finished and never saw a waitress again.  No coffee refill beyond the initial pour,  no check in to make sure everything was all right and had to go to the register to ask for our check.  My tip will reflect this service.  It's too bad because the food is worth it but the service is absolutely sub par!",

If I had spent a few more days, I'd probably go again, but I'm sure this would be on my list for a return trip.   The rest of the breakfast was normal diner fare. I have no complaints, but it wasn't particularly memorable. The sausage was greasy but good. The coffee was subpar, though.",

This place serves hotcakes, meaning they are greasily cooked platters of batter and will taste as much.  It might not be everyone's favorite, or even good, but it does serve a purpose.  I probably could only eat them once a year - or every two years - but they have an appeal.  (To be fair, I can only really eat one pancake or hotcake, they just automatically fill me up).  Coffee is served in carafes here - excellent.  This place gets 3 stars because it's a cool hang and place to eat with friends, but there's nothing extraordinary about it or that draws you back when there's so much more around that's shiny and attractive.",

Fortunately, that's what Pamela's is good at.  We also got there at a pretty good time, around 1:30, so our group didn't even have to wait for a table.  I got the stuffed banana and chocolate chip hotcakes.  They were on point.  This was also the only time that I actually was able to eat the entire things.  The portions are typically very large, so unless you spent your morning doing physical labor you probably won't be able to finish everything (without regretting it).  This is a solid brunch place. I've taken visitors from out of town to Pamela's a couple times and it's a staple PIttsburgh experience that I'd be glad to repeat more often.",

They can get a little crowded later in the morning, but when we visited around 9 on a Saturday morning there was plenty of seating available.  I think most of Pamela's dishes are fairly good, but there are two in particular that I would recommend.  On this particular visit I got to eat some of both - the Blueberry Hotcakes and the Corned Beef Hash.  Actually, any kind of specialty hotcakes are great.  Pamela's hotcakes are kind of crepe-like - thin and buttery, and extra delicious with any (and all) kinds of toppings.  The corned beef hash is tasty, and my favorite out of the savory dishes.  Overall, good food, low prices, and decent portions.  Great for breakfast or brunch!",

    "text": "I'm not the only one who thinks Pittsburgh's obsession with Pamela's is strange.   It's an extremely limited diner plus crepes. Please stop calling them \"hotcakes\".  They are not hotcakes, they are large delicious crepes. It harkens back to a time when people wouldn't eat that fancy shit. So, \"hotcakes\". Embaressing.   Other than that it's a decent diner.  Cash only and it's basically exclusively breakfast. I think they close at one or two. The menu, after the crepes, is an extremely limited selection of breakfast norms and some salads and some wraps for some reason.   There is a wait most weekends. The service is service. Apperently servers don't have sections and split tips? It's crowded and noisy even on weekdays. I'll call the ambiance \"Pittsburgh Excited\". Which is fine. But it's not nearly as good as \"I Could Read A Paper\".   I don't have anything against Pamela's, really. Its the mystic I have a problem with, it's a three star (or maybe four star becuase delicious crepes) diner with a five star reputation.    I don't think Pittsburghers really know what a diner should be like. Eat and Park, Pamela's and Ritters have ruined your concept of a diner. Eat and Park is a place for crazy people with overweight children and Ritter's, much like AA, is a an event for drunks except without the alcohol (thumbs down), so Pamela's with their hotcrepes gets all the praise.   Crepecakes are delicious, but please, stop treating it like the prize of pittsburgh, it's embarrassing.",

If you didn't know Pamela's is Barack Obama's favorite restaurant in the city of Pittsburgh (however, he typically frequents the one in the strip). Pamela's is open for breakfast, brunch, and lunch. They are famous for their crepe style hotcakes and Lyonnaise potatoes. Their hotcakes are very thin and usually packed with goodies inside. My personal favorite is the banana chocolate chip ones. The Lyonnaise potatoes are the most scrumptious potatoes in the world. They are in between a home fry and hash style of potato with onions and lots of butter. I simply cannot go to Pamela's without ordering a side of them. The squirrel hill location has bottomless coffee for $2, which I also always enjoy. They can range between in expensive to moderate in price, depending on what you order. I would say that most people can find something delicious and filling within their budget here.   The only downside to this place is they are very popular, which means you are likely to wait for a seat. That being said, they are so worth the wait!",

The reason that this experience really stood out to me, was the attention they placed on their service. Now we had a decent group of people, and one person got her order before everyone else did. There really wasn't that significant of a wait in-between though, so imagine our surprise when the server actually apologized for the wait, and gave our entire table 50% off our meal.

We walked in and were told to sit anywhere. There were some open tables that were cleared, but none of them were wiped down, so we sat down at the cleanest booth.  Our table had crumbs on it and was stick, but what ever, we didn't mind.   Our server greeted us fairly quickly. She was very nice.  We ordered our food and got it very quickly.  Another server gave us our check with our food and walked away before we had a chance to ask for silverware.  We figured she'd be back shortly to check on us... After about 10 minutes my girlfriend went to ask another server for silverware.  I cut into my omelette to find it was broccoli and cheese, not bacon and cheese as I had ordered.  The writing on the check was chicken scratch, so no surprise there. Again, I waited and waited and at my potatoes (delicious!) and toast, had another few cups of coffee.  Our server never checked on us again, but we cut see her across the room just standing.   I asked the cashier to ask the kitchen to remake my omelette when I went up to pay.  I had to wait a while for the recook, but I got it to go, and it was good the next day.  My girlfriend is a server, so I'm very sympathetic to my servers and usually tip at least 25%.

Your crammed in pretty tight and they have no concern about smashing a highchair against your table for the table sitting next you. The food came quickly and at 1st tasted delicious... about half way through the grease/butter/oil from the potatoes caches up to you and since it tates good you continue untill all the greese/butter/oil soaked food is gone and you realize as your stomach begins to remind you, eating it wasn't a good idea.    It also seems a bit pricy compared to other similar places.   They also share the space with another restaurant called NU Jewish cafe (something like that) when they really should occupy the entire space. And as I found out don't dare stand any place around the other restaurant unless that is  where you plan on going or you will receive a tongue lashing.",

Water was served in a plastic cup that had a crack in it. It wasn't leaking but inside the crack was dark dirty gross stuff. I didn't notice until halfway through. That cup should really be thrown away! I've worked in restaurants so I know that didn't get like that after just one use....  Please throw that cup away! I ordered the tex- Mex omlette with potatoes and wheat toast. Potatoes were AWESOME! Unfortunately both my omlet and toast were cold. The insides of my omlet were not even warm. Cheese was no where near  melted and meat was almost luke warm. The toast couldn't even melt the \"butter\". I can't say for sure but I'm 99 percent sure it wasn't even real butter which is a bummer. Only got offered a refill on my coffee right before I was ready to leave. I'll give it one more try since there are off days in businesses too. Hopefully next time it will be much better!",

    "text": "If you live in Pittsburgh, you have to come here for  breakfast/brunch. Amazing hotcakes. They're more like a cross between a crepe and a pancake, but so buttery and delicious. They do get sickening after a while though. I also recommend their Lyonnaise potatoes. Crispy, oniony, salty, and delicious. I've also tried their cinnamon raisin bread. Very sweet and full of fat raisins.  For lunch I've tried their fish sandwich. The fish is huge and they give you a lot of fries, but it is an average fish sandwich.   Come really early in the morning, otherwise line is always long, especially at the Shadyside location. Overall, large portions, cheap price, not good for diet.",

Sadly the service is the same at each location.  One person takes order, one delivers it. That's it. You practically have to set up flares again to get someone's attention if you need anything.

Do yourself a favor and hit a better brunch place for better food or just hit the Eat'n Park down the street for solid brunch food with better service.    I really want to follow my standard rule and take another star off for not taking credit cards, too, but I'll be nice and keep them at two.

Not a flaw, from the service, to the food, and the atmosphere...why haven't I been here before? The kiddo loved his eggs, bacon and hash browns. The pancakes that came with my food rivals the quality at Massarts...quite the standard to meet. The waitress was friendly and prompt...checked on us and refilled when needed. Very reasonably priced!  Terrific place! I''m definately gonna Schwarzenegger this place...I'll be back!",

    "text": "I don't know what it is, but Pamela's (both here and on Walnut St.) have really seriously gone downhill.  On multiple occasions, at both locations, I've gotten the same utterly mediocre, greasy, uncooked food, so it's not a single day's quirk.  Bacon with grease literally pooled in its nooks and just pouring off it, French toast dripping in bright yellow wet egg that had to be sent back at least once, and upon occasion twice, to get it even lightly cooked, etc.  Totally and completely disgusting.  And then the topper - the other day when I was at this location, I opted for various reasons to leave my power wheelchair at my table when I went to the restroom (in large part because it was too crowded to move it safely through the dining room and jockey it out of the dining room and into and out of the ladies' room) - and one of the waitresses took it upon herself to decide I needed it badly enough to push it back to me entirely without my permission.   And after my telling her *straight out* to *leave it alone* at my table when she said she wanted to get it and bring it to me.  So, she got it anyways, obviously, and managed to get it back to the restroom, where it ended up blocking *everyone* from getting into and out of the room - including me - and I was tripping all over it just to get my hands washed and get back into it.   I had put the footrest up to eat so I could get close enough to the table, and now I couldn't get it down because the restroom door was blocking it, which made it hard for me to get into it and operate it because I had to hold my legs up, etc., and more.  It was a total and utterly unnecessary problem.  While I was still in the stall, I could hear her crashing it into the door and walls repeatedly until I was *finally* able to get her to just stop and leave it the hell alone.  Before I was able to leave my own stall, I heard other women leaving the room without washing at all - and that means they also had their disgusting, unwashed hands all over my chair right after using the bathroom, because it wasn't physically possible to get past it without literally climbing on top of it, requiring hands on.    Now pushing a power wheelchair when you are not familiar with how to operate it is no mean feat.  It's dangerous as fuck to everyone around, and hazardous to the chair itself. How she managed to not slam into and run over other customers I have no idea, because it definitely takes practice to learn how to operate one and not crash it into other people or things - but she did screw up the chair itself by crashing it into doors and walls.    Pamela's did comp me my breakfast because of the hassle.  =============  While I'm at it, because accessibility is an important issue both to me and many other diners and shoppers, I usually say something in my reviews about what one will find in a place.    Here, their \"accessible\" restroom stall isn't actually fully accessible at all - because they have a baby changing table in there, which blocks the ability to get a wheelchair into the stall at all, let alone turned around to get back out.  It's freestanding, fortunately, so I suppose they would be willing to remove it temporarily upon request.  I have not tried that.  Knowing about that changing table is part of why I left the chair at my table in the first place, because I already *knew* it was going to be too difficult to cope with the damn inaccessible restroom.  It's a *dirty*-looking baby changing table, to boot - with the huge toilet paper lying right on the dirty bed surface.    ++++++++++++++++  That said, when I first came in, they were *super* helpful getting me settled at a table I was going to be comfortable at, back in a corner, even thought it meant them moving some tables and chairs around for me.  I can't fault them at all in that department, or with their food service.",

I was super thankful for an EGG WHITE VEGGIE OMELET that actually wasn't greasy, YAY.  This is sadly never a given anywhere.  The omelet comes unseasoned, but with salt, pepper, and hot sauce available at the table, I'm not one to complain.  Filled with plenty of mushrooms, my favorite.  My SO loved his STRAWBERRY HOTCAKES, a go-to order for him, but the thin crepe-like pancakes they serve here are a nice touch.  The filling could have used more cream, but this certainly wasn't a dealbreaker.  Coffee and hot tea were super basic but satisfying.  We were out the door for 24 bucks before tip.  A simple, family-friendly ordeal.",

The eggs were a bit oily for my liking but I forgave them because the Strawberry Hotcakes were amazing! They come with sour cream which I was a bit hesitant about, but once I took a bite it definitely worked with the flavors and balanced the sweetness. I added syrup just because, but I actually preferred them without syrup. My boyfriend got the famous potatoes and those were also great. I kept taking fork-fulls off his plate. I paid $25 (including tip) for the both of us which I was not mad about. Would return and recommend.",

You know how you can tell a place isn't worth your time?  When you and your friend are eating at Pamela's and can only discuss how good Murray Ave Grille's breakfast is.  Finally, you both admit you would rather be at the Grille.  Lets start with the big issue:  The service SUCKS.  Apparently, the servers split their tips at the end of the shift.  So no one bothers to serve you.  One guy took our orders and brought drinks, and another girl dropped the food on the table.  No one asked if we needed anything, and no one bothered to check that the food was OK.  So...servers working a buffet do more work than the servers at Pamela's.  I got the ham and cheese omelette, with the potatoes, and rye toast.  The actual breakfast was good diner breakfast.  There was a nice amount of cheese, this potato hater thought the potatoes were good, and the rye toast was fantastic.  There is outdoor and indoor seating, which is nice.  The place is rather packed, though.  Cash only.",

    "text": "We came here for brunch on a weekend, anticipating a wait but the entire staff is so efficient at getting people in and out of the door that we didn't have to wait very long. That being said, your meal does feel very fast because of the efficiency, this isn't going to be your hours long lounge-around brunch. We were told to try this by local friends and so I was excited (I'm definitely a breakfast food person). Being gluten free, I was unfortunately only able to have a few things on the menu (your usual gluten-free breakfast items were all available to me...eggs, potatoes, meat). I wish they would have had a bread substitute which would have opened up quite a few more options. I ended up ordering the meat and cheese omelet which was good. My boyfriend had their famous crepe-style pancakes which he was actually a tad disappointed in (he has grown up with good home-made ones). My one big takeaway would be that it was good but not amazing. I would really appreciate an updated menu with gluten free items clearly delineated.",

I had 2 eggs over easy with bacon home fries and toast and a hot chocolate. The eggs were cooked just right but that was were it ended for me. The bacon was not that good and the home fries were not good and had a weird taste to them. The hot chocolate was ok but tasted like swiss miss. The service was excellent and was fast and friendly. I have to say i ws disappointed after seeing so many 5 star reviews and the food being a 2-3 star. Service was excellent and definitely worth 5 stars. I would have to say I would not go back again at least not for eggs and bacon. Too me it looked as though most people were eating pancakes.",

I was there today, Monday, December 10th at around 11:30.  Came in and saw that not even half of the tables were occupied yet.  Sat down and waited about 10 minutes for someone to approach our table.  There was some girl visiting and obviously a friend of the staff's because that's where the entire staff was!  This went on for another five minutes.  Then a young man came over and what we would like to drink.  Now at this point I am getting curious so I checked my watch...it was exactly 11:47.  At 11:58, I told my lunch partner, \"that's it...we're leaving.\" As my friend started to put on his coat, the young man literally came running and apologizing for the delay.  He said, \"I was involved in something else.\"  He brought our coffee and took our orders.  I had to correct him twice on the order as I watched him write it. The food came, and both orders were wrong.  The young woman who dropped of the meals asked if there was anything else and we told her what was missing and she promptly brought it as well as a pot of coffee which is a Pamela's standard and not done by the young man. What happened? Do P&G not monitor or visit this location any more? Millvale had similar issues but have improved vastly and is a much better location for service. All of the sudden we realized that it was THIS location where we had terrible service before and at the time swore never to return. This time I should etch it into my skin because I will never return. The Strip and Millvale locations will see my money but never again, Squirrel Hill.",

I can say that is somewhat accurate. All of my food tasted of butter in some way, but it wasn't overwhelming for me. I liked the taste. It just wasn't a light breakfast.   I had the veggie omelet with the potatoes and toast. Everything was delicious, and I couldn't finish my plate because there was so much food.   We arrived at 8:00 on a Saturday, and we could seat ourselves right away. We had great service the whole time. Very friendly and gave us the right amount of attention.

I ordered the strawberry hotcakes, and they were mind blowing! Instead. Of regular pancakes, they tasted more like high quality crepes! For the price you pay, I'm impressed they were as good as they were! They were nice and crunchy on the outside, and soft and fluffy in the center. The whipped cream was fluffy and melted nicely onto the hotcakes, and the strawberries were as fresh as they get! They didn't use those weird preserves or anything like that. The portions are huge too! When ordering you get 2 hotcakes per order, and 1 was already enough to fill me to the brim. As for service, They kept our cups filled and service was great! I thought it was a bit funny that they had so many pictures of Obama everywhere, haha. Oh! Remember, this place is CASH ONLY!",

It's seat yourself and wait until a waitress comes over. They're usually pretty busy, so you may have to wait at a dirty, wobbly table for awhile. The 2nd time I went I changed from one dirty table to another because I don't think the waitress saw me. No worries...but I didn't really appreciate it when she got irritated I was at a 4 person table (I was solo) and suggested I move to a 2 seater by the bathroom....no, sorry lol.  But, the food. Yes. First time I got the Tex omelette with chorizo, topped with sour cream. Wasn't sure how well the sour cream would go with eggs, but it was great. I was impressed with the flavor of the chorizo too. Nice big slices of bread & those potatoes are the bomb.  2nd time I got the chorizo hash with bacon & a side of kielbasa. The kielbasa was black when it came out but still tasted really good so I didn't complain or send it back.  Sad to say I haven't tried the crepes yet; they sound great!  It gets very busy, is cash only, and you may need patience on even a slow day. But the food is really good and it's a tourist spot you should see if you're visiting.",

I came for the first time last weekend and was blown away by their delicious crepe style \"hotcakes\". The pancakes were so incredibly crispy on the outside but soft in the center, dripping with melted butter and syrup. I can't wait to return and try out some of the many other GREAT options on this menu. The service was great(very fast and nice), and the atmosphere is super cool and historical. I recommend checking out the original Squirrel Hill location as this diner is packed with Pittsburgh culture and history. MUST GO! Bravo Pamelas and see you very soon!",

If I could give a 3.5, that might better represent what i think of them.  They are very popular on the weekends. Some of the staff was a lot more on the ball and attentive than others.  I got the Tex-Mex omelet,  and overall it was pretty good. But there were little things that I wasn't thrilled with. They were a bit skimpy on the guacamole,  the chorizo was sparse and diced into tiny bits such that it had some flavor. But it was skimpy as well. Last, they seem to use margarine instead of butter on everything,  although I suppose you could request butter. Just an FYI.  The lyonaise potatoes seems to be their trademark breakfast thing. They are heavy, but good. Seems to be what everyone was getting.  Their crepe style pancakes looked good, if you are into that, but I'm not. They seem like a great choice for a lot of people, just not me.",

I typically order the Morning After special, which comes with hot cakes, eggs, and meat, but I typically substitute the meat for Pamela's famous eggs. As a vegetarian, I'm very grateful that they always allow for this substitution without any hassle. Food usually arrives very quickly after your order is placed. I'm always stuffed after a visit to Pamela's - be prepared to enter a food coma after any meal here!  Other things to note: cash only, be prepared to wait 30+ mins on Saturday and Sunday mornings.",

Because it had lines down the block and was basically the only breakfast spot in squirrel hill, I felt like I had to deal with the awful stomach aches I'd get after. The truth is, there is simply TOO MUCH butter on this food. If you see the pancakes in my picture, you will see the edges are brown and fried and completely greasy. This will give a lot of people a stomach ache folks! Can Pamela's be tasty? Sure, because butter can of course be a tasty thing. But I cannot keep pretending this is good breakfast when it's not.  This time around I had a egg sandwich as well, and it was small but decent tasting. I cut off the pancake \"crusts\" and ate the inside. Maybe the omelettes are safer and less buttery, but I don't really like omelettes, so I can't comment. The potatoes are very delicious but rich and will add to your existing stomach ache.",

After being an undergrad at Carnegie Mellon, I realized how lucky I was to be able to take advantage of the amazing hot cakes, lyonnaise potatoes and the reasonable prices of Pittsburgh. Came back for the first time in 3 years and absolutely made sure that Pamela's was on the itinerary. I was worried that I had hyped up the hot cakes too much prior to our arrival but my boyfriend was amazed and how crispy yet soft they were. From family friendly to college hangover friendly, Pamela's is your weekend brunch ritual that every other city in America is missing out on. Hands down has to be one of my favorite brunch places I've been to in the nation.",

After binging on leftover Halloween candy, I opted out of the famed California french toast or crepe items and instead got the more savory corned beef and Swiss omelet.

At the server's recommendation, I got the strawberry hotcakes (with fresh strawberries) and Lyonnaise potatoes. Yum. I was a little confused about why they call these \"hotcakes\" when they seemed more crepe-y to me - but very tasty nonetheless. The potatoes were crispy and superb. This is not a breakfast to have daily (or even weekly, probably) if you're watching your sodium or fat intake but it was certainly a great diner meal. At $7.50 for the strawberry hotcakes and $3.00 for the potatoes, I thought it was just a tad pricey for a place that doesn't have real maple syrup. That being said, the next time my dad visits, I'm bringing him there. I know he'll love it.",

These folks are serious foodies and will not let you languish, light-headed from hunger, out on the street. I walked in the door thinking that it would be a month long weight. The perky hostess, with the really cool wind-surfing shoes chirped, \"15 minutes.\" And 15 minutes it was down to the last second.  Pamelas is one of those small, cozy (and by \"cozy\" I mean a tight fit) neighborhood places that you wish were just around the corner from where you live.  I went with the suggestions by my fellow Yelpers and ordered the strawberry hotcakes. The hotcakes are really not the kind you'd get in most diners - these are thin, chewy, delicately browned, buttery crepes filled with....drum roll, please...fresh strawberries, brown sugar and sour cream.  Somehow all these ingredients work together in one melodious symphony in your mouth. It is just the right combination of sweet and tart. My only complaint is portion sizes. They give you two of these delights that cover the plate from end-to-end. Service was lightening fast (5 minutes on a busy Saturday morning) and pleasant. Coffee was strong but rich - the kind you love to doctor to get it just right. The hub order corned beef hash - delish - this stuff ain't outta the can!

However, in my visit today, I desired a second cup of hot tea. The server attempted to charge me again, a second $1.90. When I objected, I was told it was the policy.  I spoke with the manager. He would not change the policy, and said only that he would talk to the general manager. I asked if the restaurant charged for a second cup of coffee. Of course not. Refills on iced tea? Free, of course. I pointed out the cost to the restaurant of that second cup of tea. (Approximately seven cents, including the generic tea bag, a few ounces of hot water.) He only reiterated that he couldn't change the policy.  It's a shame, I've enjoyed Pamela's. But until they change this obnoxious policy, I won't be returning.",

We shared the chorizo hash with fried eggs, strawberry hotcakes, and a side of lyonnaise potatoes.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  The strawberry hotcakes are stuffed with fresh strawberries and sour cream which was a surprisingly amazing combination.  I would go back everyday just for the lyonnaise potatoes.  Do not forget to order these when you go!  Quaint, diner environment with an open front-room if the weather is nice.  The perfect brunch place whenever you visit Pittsburgh!",

The  atmosphere is a over crowded typical diner. I do give them props for there eggs and bacon light fixture. Sadly I don't go to restaurants for decor. The food was  bad. I got a omelette with toast, my friend got their pancakes. The omelette was blend and among the worst diner omelettes I have tried. There was no freshness to the eggs nor meats. My toast was swimming in butter, I actually scraped two layers off. The pancakes that they are famous for....tasted like thinly fried butter. More like state fair food than a restaurant. I will be sticking to traditional pancakes. There are way to many diners around here to give them a second chance.",

    "text": "Today I was in a Pamela's Pancake Coma. After ingesting two of these famous little devils, I proceeded to race to the airport (Because we left the restaurant too late) and missed my flight back to Boston. I am writing this waiting for 5 hours, and I still am not hungry for lunch. At least I ended my trip home well.   This story, only validates the fact that when growing up in Pittsburgh,  Pamela's is the best staple breakfast joint. The previous location in Squirrel Hill was a tiny little hut, but now, the new Pamela's Upstreet takes over the old Panera space on Murray Avenue and includes garage door-style front patio.  My staple at Pamela's has to be the crispy crepe-like chocolate chip, banana stuffed pancakes! They are thin and decadent. Buttery and rich. After eating two of these, you will be stuffed, happy and ready for a mid-morning nap (or a missed flight) I also love that they also have a special called \"The Morning After,\" Which, I feel like describes the quality of Pamela's \"Hangover Cure.\" Also, don't forget to try the semi-famous potatoes alongside a carafe of hot coffee for 1.95 pp!   My only riff is that I find it problematic that our server was busy and couldn't be that attentive. I'm sure the weekends are a circus show, but I still give them 5 stars. It's a diner people!   Maybe next time I'll eat at Pamela's before the day of my flight. So I can stuff my face, and go home to take a nap.",

    "text": "Not a bad place for brunch once in a while, especially if you're looking for some comfort/hangover food. They have pretty standard brunch selections--hotcakes, French toast, omelettes, eggs, bacon and sausage combinations, etc. They also offer burgers and salads. Nothing to rave about though. Hotcakes are apparently their specialty, but get them plain and they will get too buttery and sickening after a few bites.   Which is why most people go for their various hotcakes with toppings; an especially recommended one is the banana walnut. The strawberry cream is also quite good. But do keep in mind that the main thing that turned the hotcake into such a sweet concoction is a couple days' worth of sugar and syrup. At the very least, their breakfast combinations are huge (so as to keep in proportion with the sugar maybe).  Their service is also mediocre; they try to have it like a diner atmosphere, but in reality what happens is that your server (or any server at all) rarely comes by once you order and the food comes. It was a challenge to ask for a refill of water. At the end you bring your receipt up and pay at the counter (which only accepts cash, beware), and then as common courtesy you have to go BACK to your table and leave your meager tip for their meager service.",

    "text": "I've had my share of complaints about the chain of Pamela's restaurants--most saliently, very few menu items are good and you shouldn't call yourself a diner if I can't walk in and get breakfast for dinner--but the one in Squirrel Hill really hit a new low the way they kept us waiting.  Yes, I know Pamela's is very popular and one should expect a line.  I would have had no problem with a line.  There was no line.  There were tons of empty tables.  But my brunch companion and I were left standing around.  A simple miscommunication or oversight by the staff?  I thought so too, but after talking with two staff members three times, it was obvious that was not the case.  Eventually I figured out the problem: there were two of us, and they didn't want to waste a table that could seat four people on a mere couple.  This seems like a bad business practice on a number of levels.  First, it annoys your customers to keep them waiting.  It annoys them even more when they're standing next to multiple empty tables and aren't allowed to use any of them.  Second, with no line and many empty slots, it's hardly profit maximizing.  I could have been halfway through my meal by the time another customer walked in, and given the relatively late hour and the way the crowd was dwindling, the restaurant might not have been completely full at any point for the rest of the day.  I always thought waiting in line at Pamela's happened because it was just that popular.  But maybe it's not.  Maybe waits at Pamela's happen because they don't know how to properly manage a queuing system.",

If you're lucky, you might even be able to snag one of the patio tables overlooking Murray.   The food and service is more or less the same as the old location. Get the strawberry hotcakes. Even though I feel sleepy after polishing them off, those thin crispy pancakes rolled up with strawberries and brown sugar are totally worth it. The servers aren't the friendliest, but they're very efficient and will have your order out in very little time--which means you can be savoring strawberry hotcakes all the sooner.

    "text": "Pamela's may not be the worst breakfast place I've ever been to but it is certainly  the most overrated. Ordered a mushroom omelette with the lyonnaise potatoes. The omelette was extremely under-cooked and the mushrooms were bland, soggy and metallic tasting as if the cook had just scooped a spoonful out of a can and plopped ithem into the eggs. The potatoes were also soggy and tasteless. Other members of our party had the pancakes which were slightly better but far from worthwhile. Figuring that it might have been an off day we tried Pamela's a second time when we returned to Pittsburgh a few months later. Exact same result.  I just don't get why this place has any sort of good reputation. I've had some good breakfasts in Pittsburgh. Just never at Pamela's.",

The egg whites veggie omelette was a home run, the Lyonnaise potatoes are killer, and even the black coffee was perfect.  I always enjoy some hot sauce on my breakfast food, but I couldn't bring myself to potentially mask the flavors, which were outstanding.    Liz was the attentive server, while I understood that Luis was the cook.  A tip of the cap to the team at Pamela's. It couldn't have been a better!",

    "text": "Pamela's is a unique breakfast place. First it should be noted that you can expect wait time to vary from no time at all to 30-40 minutes if they are really busy. And they often are very busy especially between 8-11 on the weekend. Also, the Squirrel Hill location and I believe most of the others are cash only. To get the full Pamela's experience I suggest you order the pancakes (the strawberry stuffed are my personal favorite) and an order of lyonnaise potatoes. The pancakes are almost as thin as a crepe, so if you're looking for a traditional thick buttermilk flapjack you won't find it here. The service is usually very quick and pretty friendly even at the busiest times. Overall this is a great breakfast spot if you won't something unique to Pittsburgh.",

The hotcakes are famous, and are something between a crepe and a traditional pancake with a little magic thrown in. The banana chocolate chip hotcakes are definitely the best ones and I order them every time, but I've also seen people order: the croissant french toast, different hotcakes, hash, and omelets and no one has ever been disappointed. The potatoes are also awesome. Probably the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had.  The main problem with Pamela's is that everyone and their mom visits on the weekend, so plan on standing around a bit to wait for a table. They also only accept cash.",

My partner is partial to the Corned Beef Hash, which even as a side can be two meals (for some people). My mom likes the crepe pancakes.  For me it's hotcakes all the way, or if I'm feeling indulgent, the specialty hotcakes, with bananas and chocolate chips. The lyonnaise potatoes are also tasty if you need some additional starch.  The coffee generally leaves something to be desired, and it's a bit annoying that they're a cash only joint, but the food comes out fast, and as long as I've got hotcakes in front of me, I'm happy.  Expect a wait if you go on the weekend.",

My husband devoured his chorizo hash, I opted for a BLT w/ fries. Very satisfied with my sandwhich, the bacon was crispy, lettuce fresh, and the fires crunchy. Service was friendly and very on-the-ball, which I've found at the Oakland location as well so no surprise there. We are looking at houses in Sq. Hill and discussed how great it would to make this Pamela's location part of our weekend routine. We'll see you after closing!",

Second, the food is marvelous. I got the banana walnut hot cakes which were more crepe like than pancake, but were delicious. There was a good banana, walnut, hot cake ratio going so you could really taste all aspects. The coffee was good too. Hot and refillable. I tried my friends layonnaise potatos and they were also good. I wasnt diappointed at all. And its really not expensive but it is CASH ONLY. It has a diner vibe but the servers are pretty hipster. It caters to all types. I would definatley go back, we drove from delmont. Yummy!",

I had the chorizo omelet. It was great! The chorizo wasn't greasy, the eggs were moist and it had the right amount of cheese. The potatoes are the best diner potatoes I've ever had! Coffee was ok, but bottomless and they give you a carafe on the table so you can refill yourself. My partner got fluffy scrambled eggs with cream cheese. He loved them too.   Note this place is cash only. The food is worth the wait if you have to. And it's reasonably priced. I highly recommend!!",

Our group had the spinach & feta omelet, the pancakes, the Banana chocolate chip pancakes, and the raisin French toast.  Our favorite was the Banana Chocolate Chip pancakes....sliced bananas rolled in a light chocolate chip pancake topped with whipped cream, SO GOOD!  The portions are large, breakfast potatoes are great, crispy on the outside and soft inside.  About $10 per person.  We arrived at 8:30 on a sunday morning and were seated right away.  By the time we were done there was a line for a table, but turnover is fairly quick and worth the wait.",
