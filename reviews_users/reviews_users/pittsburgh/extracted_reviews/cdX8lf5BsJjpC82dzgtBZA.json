This burger is one of the best in Pittsburgh. The ham BBQ topping it is an incredible touch. All of their food is unique and delicious. The bartenders are super friendly and the owners are just as nice. They want to make sure that you're having a great experience at their establishment .",

Ordered a Reuben- it came and was very small on regular tiny white bread with maybe one slice of meat- told the bartender I thought it was on rye bread - he said no it's not; they don't have it - i looked at the menu again and it said the (as any Reuben is) sandwich was on rye- i told him The menu said it as a heads up and then the response was \" oh they change it up\" - I  told him the reason I ordered it was because I think of a Reuben as a big sandwich on good thick marble rye. He said sorry.   We were still billed for everything.  If you are starting a business to locals- don't lie. Just take ownership.",

We walked in and waited 10 minutes for the waitress to take our drink orders, meanwhile the male bartender was busy talking to other customer  laughing, and joking, no acknowledgement.   We ordered the chicken and cheddar stuffed jalapenos and when they came, the jalepenos were raw and we bit into them and immediately my mouth was uncomfortably hot, no, on fire.  I only took a bite and was done.  I have a pretty high tolerance for hot foods, but this was way too hot.  It was   Do they not know you're supposed to cook the jalepenos to release some of the heat to make them edible?  I also ordered the crabcake sliders, they were mostly breading and were put on the grille and had a burnt char.  They tasted like they were old, and the slaw did too. The fries were soggy, and way over salted. Overall very disappointed with the food, in fact, I'd have to say it was horrible.  Obviously, someone invested a lot of money to get this place together.  Why not invest in a good cook and customer service?",

We stopped in for brunch and we came out Happy Campers. I ordered the Blueberry and Cream Cheese Stuffed French Toast. I also ordered a side of bacon. The side order had three strips of crunchy bacon. I can't have breakfast without bacon. YUM!  . I'll be honest. I expected canned blueberry filling in the middle of the French Toast. Much to my surprise it was real blueberries. Even with the cream cheese it wasn't overly sweet. It tasted like real blueberries. The outside was cooked perfectly. No syrup was needed. It was delightful. It came with a side of Home Fries. They are cut smaller than normal home fries and I liked them a lot. However it didn't stop there. My husband ordered Eggs Benedict. Oh My Word!  A good Hollandaise sauce is hard to find, but I found it. AND they serve the Eggs Benedict with chorizo. Let's get a little spicy. Again, YUM!!!!  Not only will we go back but we'll bring friends! For an added surprise they have a party room upstairs!!!  It has separate bathrooms, a full bar, tables, and a couch area. It's fun!  It's Hip!!  It's very cool!  If you need a venue for a wedding or baby shower or charity event. . . Maybe a birthday or anniversary party, you need to check this space out.",

On the thicker side for a crepe, this sweet pastry wrapped around perfectly cooked eggs and juicy bacon, and was every breakfast lover's dream come True! To the side, perfectly cooked hash browns with a delectable herb flavor.   My friend decided to be adventurous and ordered the Cap'n Crunch French toast, over which he rolled his eyes with delight!

    "text": "I was really excited to try Bar 3 and am always really happy to learn about great businesses coming into the Millvale community. With that being said, I was pretty disappointed with my experience at Bar 3.   I went to Bar 3 on Sunday for dinner with some friends. We sat at a high top in the bar area and were approached right away for our drink orders. However, once we received drinks it took a very long time for the bartender to come back over for our food orders. He was at the bar talking with a group of friends while we just sat and waited. Once our food arrived, it was pretty tasty and the service was not terrible, it was really just that minor detail.  I feel bad only rating two stars because honestly, it wasn't the bartender or the staff or the food. What I really did not like about Bar 3 was the vibe. There was a group of guys next to us screaming the worst country music I could imagine. I understand...it was after a Penguins game...we were getting it in too...but it was obnoxious and partially directed towards us at points. On top of the awful men singing horrendous music...the jukebox fully supported their decision. It was around 6 on a Sunday and was so loud that I couldn't really even relax to enjoy my food. I'd like to give this place another try because I really want to like it but I was just not into anything that was going on. So unless you want to feel like you are at Tequila Cowboys on a Saturday night at umm...midnight, I probably would not suggest this place after a game/before a show...etc.",

    "text": "I stopped into Bar 3 in millvale after a grueling Saturday. Myself and my 2 friends spent the day moving furniture, boxes and all manner of heavy things as I relocated from Beaver, PA to Millvale. We were tired and hungry, and we wanted a drink.  The place is well designed, having something for everybody. Tons of TVs, a nice bar area and a dining area for those hoping to avoid the fray, and free, functional wi-fi. The design on (almost) everything is modern and nice.   The exception bring the menu. It was all one font, one weight and very little thought to layout. I don't know if they change the menu frequently, but if that's not the case, it's gotta be laziness. Only 2 employees were visible, one being the bartender who was, surprise, busy tending bar, and the other being the cook, who was wandering the dining area just kind of looking around.  Both looked at us like we were on very annoying fire when we walked in, but we were hungry so we took our seats in the dining area.  Eventually, the bartender made his way over and we ordered drinks (3 waters and 2 beers) waited forever for those, then waited for him to take our order, then waited for the food. We were there longer than it took to unpack the u haul and move furniture, and it isn't because we were lingering. The service was bad. No way around it.  Now, something positive. The food. The food was phenomenal. I ordered a Ham bbq sandwich with sauteed zucchini on the side, and my friends got burgers with fries. The ham bbq was exactly what I was hoping for. Comfort food with an upgrade. The balance of the flavors was spot on, the pickles were just right, and they even got that little hint of cinnamon that is critical in good Ham bbq. Top notch. Both of my friends greatly enjoyed their burgers and fries. Everything was perfectly cooked (they both ordered medium) and, for the most part, we all left happy.  Bar 3 Millvale has a long way to go. There is a lot of room for improvement, but the food is stellar. Seeing as I'm now a local, I will definitely be returning to see how they grow.",

The shrimp and sauce were a great combo of flavors, and the bun and tomatoes were super fresh and delicious.

    "text": "Growing up in Shaler, Millvale was never a desirable hangout for me and I certainly never trekked over to eat or once I was of age, to drink.  Over the past 5 or so years, though, it seems things have started to pick up in the area.  Between the dog-friendly brewery down the street and a couple other new, fun spots, I find myself here more and more often.    Bar 3 opened in mid March(?) and it seems to do a really good business!!  I've stopped in on three occasions - twice to just have a drink and the second during happy hour for a couple appetizers.  It is clean with clean, neutral decor.  The bar is roomy and there are a few high-top tables lining the wall.  The upstairs bar just opened this May, although I have not been in recently enough to experience it in person!  The bar is fully stocked and they have a nice beer list - mostly, if not all, beers from local breweries.  The food is good - fresh.  Nice happy hour deal ($5 appetizers).  I had the boneless wings when I was here (YUM - still thinking about them) and my friend and I split the nachos.  All three times I've been here, it's been scattered with a mix of people - definitely a nice crowd.   Nice atmosphere, great bartenders, good food and drinks with decent prices and specials. Couldn't ask for anything more and I think it will do well here.  Glad to have it nearby!",

They even went out and bought us black tablecloths the day of the event. The space easily accommodated our group of 35. They offered the jukebox or a hook up that a dj can easily plug in to play music over their system. We selected a buffet option for a very reasonable price that included chicken Parmesan, vegetables, pasta, salad, and potatoes. The chicken Parmesan exceeded my expectations and would definitely recommend it for a party. The bartender and owner were very accommodating and a pleasure to deal with. Although, I only drank miller lite at the party, I can attest to their wide variety of craft beers and my mom raves about the blue Hawaiian drink. It's a great, classy addition to the millvale scene. Worth a try if you're in the area or looking to host an event at a reasonable price.",

I had looked at the menu in advance, and thought it looked promising - a variety of selections somewhat elevated from typical bar food, and some healthy choices as well. As we had already eaten dinner, we opted for a less healthy spinach dip, but it was tasty!  The beer selection was very good, too, with a variety of beers, not just IPAs or Miller Lites.  We saw that they had the Lambic Framboise and the bartender was happy to mix it with some Hoegarden, to allow us to share (try it if you haven't done so - really a nice combination).    Service and the overall ambience of the bar were also a step well above average. This makes Bar 3 competitive with nearby brew pubs, which are fun, but often overcrowded. I would recommend for anyone who might be planning to see a show at Mr. Smalls, etc., as a nice pre-/post- stop.",

I will say the atmosphere was really nice inside.  Everything looks new and clean and made for a good drinking spot.  The food kind of fell flat however.  We ordered the pretzels and beer cheese as an appetizer.  They were decent, nothing special.  For my meal I went with the buffalo chicken sandwich.  This was a really average sandwich.  The menu said the chicken was breaded, but it was not a thick enough batter.  The chicken itself was definitely not crispy.  This caused the buffalo sauce the make the sandwich a little sloppy.  The buffalo sauce itself did not have a very good flavor and had no spice to it at all.  The ranch dressing they had also had a strange taste to it.  It seemed house made, but it just tasted off.",

It's very spacious-  a mixture of high and low tables. You seat yourself, so I sat at a low top table in the back of the restaurant. It's very clean and fresh!   Since it was so hot on Friday, I didn't order a beer or cocktail- but they a great selection of local brews!   To start, we ordered the pretzels. You get 4 pretzels for $9. They were very good - I definitely order them again!   For my entree, I ordered the steak salad. To be honest it was kinda of small to be paying $13 for the size of the salad. The steak was cooked just right and the salad was delicious. My friend ordered the crab salad - she said it was good but also very small.   Overall, I'm glad Bar 3 is now open in Millvale.

What's worse, is that we live almost directly across the street. Tonight, on a whim, we decided to walk across the street for a quick, light dinner and boy are we glad we did.  First of all, Bar 3 has a really nice, modern and very clean interior. My only gripe is that the marble bar and table tops along with the metal chairs, give the place a somewhat cold and harsh feel. A nice wooden bar and table tops and leather/wood chairs would really warm the place up, but that's nitpicking...  On our visit there were several other guests both at the bar and at the tables and Mark, the lone bartender/server was handling it like a champ. We were glad we got a chance to introduce ourselves to our Millvale neighbors and the service was really great.  For \"dinner\" we chose the whole wings with the garlic butter sauce, the fried Brussel sprouts and a Ruben sandwich. The wings were large, crispy and flavorful and not drenched in sauce, which I really like. On Wednesdays whole wings are $1 each which is an absolute bargain, one we will be taking advantage of soon. The fried Brussel sprouts topped with blu cheese and balsamic were also very good although they would have been even better if they were just a little crispier and more \"roasted\". I didn't try the Ruben, but my fiance really liked it. They also have a nice selection of local beers on tap, which is a real plus.  All in all, Bar 3 is a real gem in the heart of Millvale and I'm glad they are here and that we finally decided to give them a try. My only regret is that we waited so long...",

    "text": "I stopped into Bar 3 after reading other great Yelp reviews. I'm not familiar with Millvale & was attending a show around the corner at Mr. Smalls & wanted to grab a bite pre-show. I sat at the bar & was promptly greeted by the female bartender who was very friendly. I ordered a Grist House beer of which several were on tap & she pointed out which ones were IPAs, etc. The beer was cold & fresh. They have a fairly large menu for a small place and I ordered the steak & Gorgonzola flatbread. It came with spring mix salad & tomatoes on top & a side of balsamic vinaigrette dressing. It was good, but not great. I liked their menu choices & they have daily specials too, but I was surprised that appetizers cost basically as much as entrees $12-$14 seemed average for both. My flatbread was $14. Maybe I'm getting old, but for a bar in Millvale I considered that pricey. Having said that, the decor is nice, staff friendly, convenient to Mr. Smalls & menu selection covered burgers, pasta, salads & flatbreads. So a good place to stop into when you're in the area.",

The service is prompt,courteous, and friendly. And the food/ fresh, delicious, and plentiful. We have been taking advantage of the Monday nite burger special which combines the most unique things to please and tantalize your palate. These enormous burgers also come with tasty fries which add to the exceedingly good value and amazing taste! Based on the contents of the various burgers( the very freshest and seasoned perfectly) I would say you could try anything in the menu and be delightfully satisfied! One of our favorite Millvale stops!!",

    "text": "On my first visit I learned I arrived way to early for it to open so I decided to return on the weekend. I had a wonderful waitress and basically had the whole place to myself! The seating area is small with TVs blasting everywhere and your bar is in the front. I sat towards the back so I could enjoy something off the Sunday brunch menu.  Since it was early afternoon I decided to try a lunch sandwich of chicken. All brunch items come with a side of hash browns. I was hot so I just asked for ice tea and they brewed some up just for me! I was grateful. I got my food fairly fast and she even gave me some ketchup for my hash browns. Both the sandwich and the hash browns were delicious! I was afraid the hash browns would be overly greasy but they weren't.  I learned that on weekends they switch over to the regular menu after 2 and now they have added Friday earlier hours so they can serve lunch. Normally with the major hockey playoffs going on this place will get jammed later and parking is free on Sunday.  They do offer free WiFi here since reception is very bad.My only slight problem was that my table seemed a bit high from my chair but I was able to manage. Located only a few doors down from Jean-Marc Chattilier's French bakery, metered street parking is available. This place has a nice decor to it and is reasonably priced. I learned they had opened in March so they are relatively new to area. It is a simple drive back to Rt 28 where you can get to some of the more known neighborhoods in less than 10 minutes.",

    "text": "FYI their hours have changed apparently and brunch is only til noon. So we got the regular menu which was fine because I wasn't really in the mood for breakfast. The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable about the different beers on tap which I appreciated but they were out of a couple things I wanted. I wasn't feeling overly hungry so I just got the brussel sprouts as I am usually obsessed with brussels. Omg worst decision ever. You could tell they absolutely were not fresh. They were whole and small and definitely looked like the frozen microwaved kind you get out of a steam bag. They were soggy AF and not in the least bit crispy. Barf. Next my fiance got the quesadilla burger which was okay but very difficult to eat. The fries were the best part of our meal but they were pretty salty.. Lastly it was not even busy in there but the bartender rarely checked on us and took awhile to get us the check because she was busy gossiping with her friends who were there..talking badly about a mutual acquaintance who apparently had come into the restaurant days before. Not a good look and totally unprofessional. She also let her friends search channels on the TV which led to a long time of complete silence while they flipped through channels..no music on either. It was strange. There really wasn't much to be desired here to bring me back..",

    "text": "This place was a great little meeting spot! We had 8 people in our party and arrived just before 4 on a weekday. Happy hour is 4 - 6pm and they have about 10 food options for $6. Our group ordered a variety of the options - Buffalo Mac & Cheese, boneless wings, fish tacos, pulled pork sandwich, chili, and soft pretzels. The Mac & Cheese was good - light on the chicken, but had good flavor and dense spiral noodles. I'd get it again on the happy hour menu! The portion looked small when it came out, but I was hungry and it was enough to fill me up over happy hour.   The beer list is written on the chalkboard when you enter. There is a good variety of draft beers and bottle options. There were ~6 options from Grist House and plenty of other options.  The dining area is a up two steps from the bar area and is spacious - our party and another party of 8-10 were there at once and there were still plenty of seats available. The only server was the bartender at the time - I'm guessing they didn't expect 2 larger parties to come in before 5 on a weekday. She was very friendly and as attentive as she could be for us and the many people at the bar.",
