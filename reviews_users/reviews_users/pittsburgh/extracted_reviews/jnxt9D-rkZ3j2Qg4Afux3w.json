It's a very thin pizza crust topped with a delicious Turkish meat sauce. That's it. You get two 4 slice crusts (8 slices total) in one approximately $10 order and I crave it. The hummus is quite delicious too. And, the 2 gyros and fries deal is cheaper than any other pizza shops around. Consistency is not always on the side of absolutely delicious with the gyros. But, the lahmajun will keep me coming back again and again. Their cheesy bread sticks are also quite good. Terrible for you. But, good. Give Ephesus a try :)",

Their regular pizza tastes like bad grade school cafeteria pizza. Their white pizza is soggy, greasy, undercooked and the veggies are wilted, sloppy and pathetic, nowhere near as fresh as they once were. The time I got chicken carbonara, it tasted like someone poured hot 2% milk over noodles- runny and flavorless. The only thing that saves this place are their breakfast pizzas. They are pretty sweet. But considering the last 3+ times I've ordered, the wait has been over an hour and a half, not even breakfast pizza will bring me back. Oh, and their one delivery guy is SUPER creepy to girls with tattoos.",

    "text": "Update: after having tried Ephesus a couple more times, I have to say that I am a fan, and it's now my go-to spot for pizza. Their pies are pretty good, but what really won me over was their wings (they're called \"wing dings\" on the menu). They are crisp on the outside, yet juicy and succulent on the inside. They don't skimp on the sauce and there is plenty extra to dip my crust in. Usually when you order wings from a pizza place around here, they'll arrive soggy and congealed. At Ephesus the wings are not fatty and are well cooked.  I haven't tried one of their moroccan pizzas but that is next on the list. The last time I had food delivered from there, I did not think it took too long, but it was the owner who brought it and he said that I should order by phone rather than online and it will be quicker. So I guess it must take some time for the grubhub orders to go through or be acknowledged.",

The first time we ordered we just got a regular pizza and we were surprised to get a really delicious pizza delivered to our door within 30 minutes.  This time we went for something unique and ordered the gyro special with fries and also the Pide with Soujcuk and egg (Turkish pizza). We both absolutely loved both items. I was surprised to get such a delicious gyro from a take out joint and the Turkish pizza was great for something different!  Will definitely order again.",

If you are getting it delivered, they make mistakes extremely often and the owner will argue with you over the phone to the point that by the time you eat your food, it is ice cold.   I have never had an owner argue and attack me verbally over the phone for ten minutes, it is truly a first. Not too mention when they put cheese on my pizza, after I expressly said no cheese six times, I cannot physically consume it, and after the owner have argued with me, it had been over an hour and a half since I had placed my order.   You'd be better off ordering pizza at Taco Bell.",

I received the traditional e-mail from GrubHub stating that my order was in the works and would be delivered between 8:15 and 8:25 pm. This was not a problem.  8:35 rolled around and my food had still not been delivered. I called the store to find out where my food was. The young girl on the phone simply said that they were backed up because of the GrubHub orders, and that was it, no apology. I asked if my food was on its way and gave her my address. She told me it was. 25 minutes later, at 9 pm, my food finally arrived lukewarm, with no apology made as to how late it was.  The food itself was good, but the customer service was severely lacking. A simple phone call to let us know our food would be 35 minutes lat would have sufficed. Even an apology would have been better than the treatment we received.  I'm not sure if this shop is new to GrubHub, but I feel that they should have been better prepared for the influx of orders that using the system would cause.",

They said our pizza was on the way. Another 20 minutes later I called. They said they'd call the driver. Fifteen minutes later I called and they said they'd call the driver again. I asked the woman her name and told her to refund my money. Silence. I asked her for her name again. She hung up! Ten minutes later the cold pizza arrived. Unacceptable. Such a disappointment! A simple, \"We are sorry. It's a busy night\" would've sufficed. Not from these folks. Business 101: don't piss off your customers. They'll tell everyone they know.

My group tried the chorizo and fontilla pizza and it was mind-numbingly good. The crust was robust yet soft and doughy and the toppings were unexpected yet so well curated. None of us like olives, which come with that pizza, but we forgot to ask for them to be left off and the flavors of the pizza worked so well together that we all enjoyed the olives! That really says something!   The staff was friendly and laid back. We had ordered over the phone and mentioned a coupon which we forgot to take along at pick up. No one cared and we still received our free cheesy bread sticks, which are really a generous sized pizza sans sauce, which we all loved. The grape leaves were a bit dry but still preferable to the overly saturated ones you find in cans or at the Greek olive bars in grocery stores. An order of grape leaves also meant complimentary garlic bread. This place does not skimp on carbs!   Check out their menu and coupons. You're bound to find a flavor styling and deal that works for you!",

We ordered a white pizza and the hummus platter (hummus, veggies, pita). Pizza was great - cooked perfectly and tasted yummy. The hummus platter...the hummus has always been delicious and last night was no different. However, the veggies that they sent were disgusting and old. The carrots were *actually slimy.\" Gross.  Knowing that we were the last order of the night (because they seriously called me like \"hey, um, since you're paying on a card, we need to know the tip amount so we can close the store\" - I tipped in cash), I decided to wait until today to call, and I *specifically* waited until after lunch rush (1:00pm+). After explaining to the manager (or owner...I don't know...it was a lady with a thick accent) what happened, and asking for a refund or a note to credit our account, she was just silent. I'm like \"Hello are you there?\" She says \"Yes, why you didn't call last night??!!\" So I'm like \"Are you f****** joking right now? THAT's your response!?\" I told here that I decided to wait because I knew we were the last delivery. She was VERY short with me, in fact rude and unprofessional, and responded \"OK, I'll give you refund.\"  The last thing I said - before the bitch hung up on me - was \"You know, you could really use a lesson in customer service. I truly hope that you are not the owner, because if this is how you're running your business, you most definitely won't be around for much longer.",

It tasted like it was processed or frozen beforehand. The best part hands down were the fries on top! Overall, two personal pizzas were enough to feed three very hungry people with some left over. I'd order from here again but next time I'd go in to see if the dine-in experience is a little better.",

The fries were soggy and bland! The chicken sandwich had a gummy consistency like it was either old or not Cooked properly! If I could give no stars I would...also they served some strange off brand ketchup!!! That's a big no no in the burg! I'm considering calling for a refund!!!! I give credit where credit is due but ergh!!!! So many better options! Update: contacted grub hub and let them know about the order and I actually found my sandwich was raw! The restaurant absolutely refused to reimburse any of my money and was unwilling to work with the Grubhub customer service rep! Guess they will take anything they will get and really do not care about customer service! Crap food crap service!",

Delivery times are also wildly unpredictable ranging anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours.  Avoid this place unless can afford the time and hassle.",

After about 45 mins of trying to get to the restaurant, I called to explain I would not be able to pick up my food that I ordered since my car could not get through the 1+ feet of water. After some back and forth the restaurant agreed to cancel my order even though it was already made. Instead of doing so, they lied to get me off the phone and said they would cancel the order, but instead charged me anyway. I can not order from a restaurant that lies to itz customers.

    "text": "In mid November seven of us ordered a variety of dishes delivered on a Saturday afternoon. I got the garden salad and tabouleh, and the others got burgers and pizza. They had no complaints about their food but mine was awful. The salad was at best medium sized and had little more than iceberg lettuce, some tomatoes and a minute amount of cucumber. It was warm from being in the bag with the hot food. The tabouleh was the worst I've ever had. The parsley was old and tough, and there was virtually nothing else in it, just small traces of bulgur wheat, no visible tomatoes, cucumber, lemon flavor or anything else you expect in tabouleh.  I couldn't eat it and put it in the fridge, thinking maybe I'd eat it later. The next day the lettuce was brown so I threw it all out. Since one of the other people placed the order, I wasn't aware of the prices and when I saw that the salad had cost $11.99 and the tabouleh $7.68, I couldn't believe I had paid about $20 for inedible food. I called on Monday and was told to call back when the manager was there. I got her the next day, complained and told her I wanted a refund for the two items. She took my information and agreed with no apology. My credit card wasn't credited after several days, so I called again on November 29. She made a hard to understand excuse about us using different banks, and took my info again. She promised to call back the next day, and I never heard from her. Obviously, she has no intention of honoring her promises and couldn't care less about correcting the bad order. I'll never order from there again.",

    "text": "If you're in the market for a buttload of carbs, look no further. This is a good local pizza shop! They have a huge menu with a lot of unique pizza offerings, many with a Mediterranean influence (for example, Morrocan chicken and spiced plum pizza, which is surprisingly tasty). They also have the standard make-your-own pizza toppings and the usual specialty pizza suspects (white pizza, buffalo chicken pizza). In general, they make a solid pie. Their crust is slightly sweet and more on the doughy than crispy side (which I happen to prefer). Their red pizza sauce is also slightly sweet, but well-balanced with acidity from the tomatoes and well seasoned. And, importantly, they don't skimp on the cheese or on the toppings, which is appreciated.  What I like even more than the pizza, however, are their non-pizza apps and meals. For example, their boneless wings are surprisingly delicious for being made at a pizza shop. They're large and meaty with a nice crunchy coating and doused in your choice of sauce (I'm a fan of the honey BBQ sauce). I also like their pasta dishes -- they make a really good chicken parm pasta dinner (which, again, I did not expect at a pizza joint). I'd also recommend their subs -- they are generous with the fillings, and the bread they use is really hearty and chewy. They also offer several Turkish specialties (Pide (Turkish pizza), kabobs, babaganoush, etc.). I've not sampled many of these, but I look forward to working my way through that part of the menu soon!  Overall, I think it's great that there is such a huge variety of items that you can order from this one shop. Prices are fairly reasonable too -- just be sure to grab one of their menu flyers (or look online) and don't order anything before checking our their deals. They offer TONS of coupons and specials, so take the time to check out their flyer to make sure you don't miss a chance to save money!",

On 420 I ordered a veggie personal pizza with white sauce for my beautiful girlfriend and I ordered a medium pizza with pepperoni mushroom onion for myself. I go to pick it up and the lady working acted like she had no idea where my order was and then she gave me two personal pizzas (mess up #1) she said she will make my medium pizza and to give her 10 min so I wait, she eventually comes out with a medium pizza I take it to my car open the box and there is no pepperoni on the pizza (mess up #2) I go back in to tell the lady that there is no pepperoni and she tells me that I never ordered pepperoni so I take my phone out and show her my online order and all she says is 5 minutes. We finally make it back home to eat the pizza and my girlfriends pizza is made with red sauce when we ordered it with white sauce (mess up #3) My pizza was not even edible, the was pizza was not even cut and the whole pie was absolutely drenched in grease. It was like trying to eat a pizza that sank to a bottom of a swimming pool. Will not be returning, very frustrated with how much money I wasted on this establishment.",

It looks like the salad bar just threw up on the pizza.\"  Delivery took over an hour, but worse is the fact that the pizza was completely smothered in nearly raw onion, peppers, mushrooms, and sausage. I am more tolerant of raw onions than many people, but undercooked sausage is just plain gross. And of course the crust was totally soggy, so picking up a slice just made half the toppings fall on the plate anyway. Won't be trying this place again.",

I order the vegetable breakfast pizza from Ephesus and it's always fresh and perfect, with grilled vegetables and no burnt or mushy bits. My other favorite is an asparagus pizza with a gluten-free crust. My carnivorous coworker likes their large steak hoagies because you are getting actual steak, and not re-heated \"soup meat\".

I had to have the buffalo chicken pizza and boy am I glad I did! The toppings are LOADED on... The chicken is moist and there are fried potato slices. The cheese is so good and the crust is crisp on the outside, yet so soft on the inside. Excellent! We've also ordered the lamb and chicken kebab pizza that come with individual generous kebabs on top of the pizza!  The hummus is to die for and the pita bread makes it even better! So soft and completely addicting. My only recommendation is to order more bread than what comes with the hummus!  I work in the area, so we've had our orders delivered and they always arrive before the expected time, which is great! I love that they offer personal size pizzas, which are an extremely generous portion and well worth every penny. I highly recommend Ephesus!!",

    "text": "So, a co-worker of mine said that she had a taste for \"pide\" and would I like to join her for lunch.  To myself, \"Um, what the heck is \"pide\"?  However, I told her, \"Yes, that sounds pretty good\".  So down the street and around the corner and into a building tucked away on Fourth Street, Downtown, we go!  After giving the secret handshake and being sworn to silence, we enter what looks like a vacant space and order \"pide\" (Turkish pizza).  OMG!  Who knew that anything like Turkish pizza existed?  It was so tasty!  Pide does not look like pizza; Shaped like a flat football with pinched ends and filled with eggs, cheese and spinach, it was unusual but wonderful.  My co-worker, who frequently eats vegetarian meals turned me on to this and I couldn't thank her enough. Since the pide was so tasty, I decided to try one of the Ephesus gourmet pizzas with kebabs.  You can order either chicken or lamb kebobs and I ordered half of each on my pizza.  I thought that they would slice the kebab meat and stick on the pizza, but no!  Each slice has its own kebab!  Yippee Skippee!  The best way to eat it is to hold the skewer inside the slice and then wrap the pizza slice around the kebab meat.  Mmmm Mmmm Good!  Ephesus' Downtown Pittsburgh location has since moved closer to PPG Plaza and more easily accessible, which is a good thing.  They also now have a location in Aspinwall which is closer to my home and boy am I glad.  I took a friend visiting from out of town there and he ordered the Moroccan Spiced Chicken and Dried Plum pizza.  I would have never associated those ingredients with pizza, but they were tasty too!  Don't go there looking for fawning service or an elaborate atmosphere...It's not that place.  However, if you want to try delicious pizza with unusual toppings and an excellent crust, this is your place!",
