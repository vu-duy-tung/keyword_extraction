I also love how uncrowded it is, with seating never being an issue. Staff always very kind and attentive! Good bar w/ all the making of a regular hang out spot!",

Impressive selection of vegetarian entrees, pretty unique for the area. Menu is surprisingly diverse, with options like daal, surf and turf sandwich, teriyaki chicken, shellfish, and falafel. Of course pub standbys like grilled sandwiches and nachos are good.",

    "text": "For a great selection of micro-brew beers, I'd definitely throw this on the list.  It's a must stop before heading down to the Waterfront to do some shopping.  It's a refreshing taste of authenticity among all of the chain restaurant stops throughout the shopping area.  They have a great variety of beers on tap from all over, though it's always great to see locals being thrown in that mix!  The bartender seemed to be pretty knowledgeable about the different beers and if you're not as informed about your micro-brews, he seemed to be a great source of info!  If you don't see anything that wets your appetite out of a tap, their extensive beer cooler is bound to cure your thirst.  Though I didn't go this route, they had an intriguing idea of flavored infused vodkas.    To go with their abundance of brews, their menu had something for everyone as well.  The fish tacos were real tasty, but a little to wet.  Though I hate using it as an excuse, I was able to look past this since there were a huge group ordering just after us.  I was happy that they didn't go away from the authenticity of the tortilla.     All and all, I will definitely be a repeat offender here and wouldn't send anyone anywhere else before facing the shopping crowds!",

This is how you know you are in a place that respects beer. Fluorescent lights skunk beer extremely quickly. Its nice to see that they know this. Anyway, we sat at the bar and looked over the 30 or so on-tap beers they have. I didn't know most of them, and the names of the beer don't help you identify what type of beer they are. Luckily, the bartender was super helpful and even gave us samples of anything we wanted. I got the Shakespeare Stout, Fatty Boomblatty (Hefeweizen) and something described as sour cherrys (forget the name). The first two were great. The last beer was a little too sour and the taste annoyed me halfway through. They also flavor their own liquor. They had Bacon Bourbon, Thai Chili/Garlic Vodka, Horseradish Vokda, and Raspberry Rum. Friends tried the bourbon. They said it was OK. Tasted more like fat than bacon.  The food was decent. I was told this was a gastropub, so I was expecting a little more. Everything was good, but not spectactular. I got the Corn Chowder. Friends got the pork tacos. Next time I go, I want to get more than soup.  Overall, great friendly service (bartender understood our 'death by snu snu' Futurama reference, which was awesome), terrific beer selection, decent food.",

    "text": "Blue Dust is one of those \"hidden\" Pittsburgh gems I bring people to if they are visiting the city or can't figure out \"hey, where should we eat?\"   It really has something for everyone. First, the beer selection is great. There's about two dozen seasonal beers on tap, plus loads more in the cooler. BD also has a small menu of handcrafted cocktails, some of which include their homemade liquors!   There's a monthly list of specials which always includes seasonal and local ingredients. You will also find a handful of vegetarian (and sometimes even vegan) options.   The soup changes daily, and almost all of them are winners (try the curried crab bisque!).  As for my favorites from the main fare, I simply cannot resist the Homestead Surf and Turf, a half pulled pork, half crab sandwich which comes with barbecue sauce and horseradish sauce respectively. As a side, one can choose from the yummy fresh coleslaw or chips and salsa. I will also add that this, along with just about everything else on the menu, is a very healthy portion of food.   The food and drink really make up a four-star review. What I like about Blue Dust is the atmosphere, the diverse clientele, and the service.  Patrons range from athletes fresh off the Homestead bike path to elderly folks coming from a day of shopping from the waterfront. Servers are always attentive, friendly, and have interesting stories to tell.  Did you know Frank (the bartender and manager) is an incredibly talented comic book artist? If you ever need to have a meal or drink alone, never fear about heading into Blue Dust solo. Pull up a seat at the bar and meet some wonderful people.",

    "text": "You know the little dive bar, right by the tracks on your way to the Waterfront?  The place you have driven by 20K times and never thought to actually stop in cause it's a dive bar?  Hold on to your seats, folks, cause this isn't a dive bar.   It's actually a freaking fantastic watering hole and surprisingly healthy and inventive pub.  One of my friends stopped by here and wrote something on facebook about it that made me think it was worth my while and it was way better than even expected.   The hubby and I decided to split everything after ordering some beers - cranberry ale for me (not nearly cranberry-ish enough) and a Bell's Christmas White for him (excellent choice).  Their menu is a mix of reasonably healthy and nice and awesomely naughty - perfect for the holidays.  We started with the fried zucchini which we use as a bit of a guide as we eat our way around Pittsburgh.  Almost everyone has it, almost everyone does it horribly, horribly wrong.  Blue Dust was a fabulous exception.  The zucchini appeared to have been picked that day, it was sliced super thin and breaded and deep-fried to perfection.  It was served on a bed of lettuce which did pretty-up the plate, but also served to soak up the grease.    We then asked to split the lamb chili.  I assumed we would be given two spoons and a \"go for it\" kind of attitude, but they actually split the order in two and gave us two orders of the delicious garlic bread that accompanied it.  It was amazing!  Seriously amazing.  It was just lamb-y enough that you knew that you were eating lamb, but not so lamb-y that you were wondering if you were on the farm.  It was slightly spicy and really just a perfect winter meal.    We also split the sliders - crab, smoked turkey and brisket.  They were all amazing.  Very different and very tasty.  They came with local-made chips and a fantastic smoked tomato salsa that I really could have had a massive jar of to take home.   Unfortunately, between the 2 and 3 course, I discovered the liquor menu.  Infused root beer bourbon?  Infused chai vodka?  A mixed drink with Crabbie's ginger beer?  Why didn't I look at you earlier???  We will be back.  Many, many, many times.  A must stop on your way to the Waterfront.",

The fish taco was the best I have ever tasted. the fish is NOT fried and the flavors seemed to be infused even into the center of the filet. I had the pleasure of trying the passion fruit mead. Mead is an acquired taste and this flavor perfect to overcome any strong honey taste. We cannot wait to return!",

Longer version: Oh sweet, loving, though possibly non-existent God; this place is unfortunately hidden yet wonderfully comforting. I wish I could try everything. My only option, obviously, is to go back in order to try everything.  I went with a few friends on  Tuesday night after having to go to the Verizon store at the Waterfront and not really wanting to eat at Red Robin (nothing wrong with Red Robin, though). They had 25 cent pierogies on special--obviously, we had 25 of them. They were perfectly browned, crisp on the edges, and after a little searching we managed to find the pile of onions that they were cooked with. The spinach artichoke dip was equally delicious, leading me to have faith in the other appetizers as well.  For our main course, we all ended up splitting crab curry soup, fried zucchini, and the surf'n'turf (half of a crabcake sandwich and half of a house-smoked brisket sandwich). They had a sweet collection of craft beers on tap and the dude who served us was probably the nicest person I've ever met within the food industry. The crab curry soup was simple and exactly the dish I'd go back for.  I can't wait to go back and explore the rest of what Blue Dust has to offer.",

The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because I am not a big micro brew guy and when I asked what they had they just point to a giant chalk board in the back. When you have over 20 micro brews on tap a little help would have been nice. I didn't ask for help nor did they offer so you can take that one as you want. How can you beat a killer Salmon dinner and a couple of beers for 26 Bucks?",

It wasn't so noisy that I couldn't enjoy my very tasty (and correctly poured) Guinness that was only $2.50 a pint on Wednesdays.  The staff was nice.  Everyone seemed to know \"Jerry,\" who I must assume is the owner.  The selection of beer was great.  I even like the way the trains passed by.  And the hubs, who is almost never impressed by things, said that his brisket was possibly the best he's ever had.  I had a crab roll that was pretty darn tasty as well.  Can't wait to become a regular!",

They have rotating menu with specials listed for each month. Last month i had the tilapia sandwich which was AMAZing!! Lots of flavor, not overly fried and all the veggies taste fresh.  They shop for a lot of food locally and offer healthy choices to fried foods plus they have a lot of meals you cant really get other places. My husband ordered the chicken stir-fry which was so good and they give you plenty of food for leftovers.   Took my mom here and she enjoyed it as well, even had a kids menu for grilled cheese and PBnJ sandwiches. I wanted to try some of their exoctic liquor. I dont drink whiskey or bourbon but they had a root beer flavored one so I thought what they heck. Unfortunately they had run out before i could taste it. Oh well..  I'll probably be dining their tonight and watch the pens game.",

Since my guy grew up in Pittsburgh, I jumped on Yelp to hopefully find something unique with funky creative food close to us. Neither of us felt like fighting the crowds and traffic in the Strip District.     I hit a home run with this gem I came up with! We loved the feel and friendliness of the place from the minute we saddled up at the bar. Gastro pub is the perfect description of what they do here! I ordered the pulled park sammy and it was just amazing! They smoke all their own pork and brisket right there. The sauces and accompaniments are also made in house. What a breath of culinary heaven!     Price is great, food amazing, staff friendly. We officially have a new hang out when were in Pittsburgh!",

The mac and cheese I had last week really was the best I've ever tasted, but the expensive shrimp scampi pasta I had the week after wasn't worth the price.  The \"casino butter\" just tasted like oil without any parsley or hint of lemon. The garlic bread was slightly burnt as well. I appreciate the number of large shrimp in the dish and the decent amount of spinach, but I would not fork over $15 for it.",

    "text": "I stopped by last night before seeing a movie at the Waterfront, due to the convenience of the location and having a City Dining Card for this place.  Given the high ratings, I was expecting a solid meal here. Unfortunately, however, this place failed to deliver on several counts.  Our visit got off to a shaky start when CM and I walked in and seated ourselves, per the instructions of the sign at the host stand. We sat at a table close to the front, and after perusing the menu for several minutes, nobody came to greet us.  We eventually approached to the bar to order, and the bartender apologized and said he hadn't seen us come in, and someone finally came to provide us with another menu and table service. When our waiter came to take our order, we ordered the red bean dip to share, my dining partner ordered the brisket tacos, and I ordered the lobster roll, which came to $34. Thankfully, the food came out pretty quickly after ordering.  In my opinion, the bean dip, which was thick and savory, and came with tortilla chips, was the best thing we ordered.  Although I didn't try CM's tacos since I don't eat beef, he mentioned they had so much meat that they were difficult to eat.  Despite this, he enjoyed them, however.  As for the lobster roll, one bite revealed that the toast was burnt.  Despite habitually taking photos, I'm not in the habit of inspecting my food closely before eating it, since I've never been served something burnt before, and the lighting wasn't the best.  Because the toast on the other half of the sandwich wasn't burnt as badly, I was famished, and service wasn't the most attentive, I ate it.  The lobster seemed a bit tough, and the ingredients weren't super-flavorful, but it was okay.  Both entrees came with tortilla chips, as well as a oniony salsa that I wasn't a fan of.  After about 10 min., our server returned to check on us, and I pointed out the burnt bread, and he offered to rectify it by either making anther sandwich or bringing fresh bread.  Because I was halfway through the sandwich, I chose the latter.  While he should never have served me a sandwich with burnt bread, I do give him credit for fixing the situation.  During the time that we were there, a weekly stand up comedy show that occurs during this time (8-10pm) was going on.  Although I had noticed that this would be the case, I forgot to mention it to CM.  Neither of us are huge stand up comedy fans, but one of the comedians was funny--the others were varying degrees of awkward.  The show is free, though.  It's possible that the presence of the show may have detracted from our service, but I can't say for sure.  Overall, I was disappointed in my experience at Blue Dust, although I do give them credit for correcting the burnt toast issue.  Perhaps the food tastes better once you've had a few beers, but for my part, I wasn't super-impressed. I'd be willing to give this place a second chance, but it'll probably be awhile before I do so.",

We started with the Spicy China Doll which was a lentil dip with Indian spices. Aside from the fact that the name choice is awful (i.e. China is not India), it was served with pita that was basically paper. The dip was okay, but not spicy at all -- coming from someone who considers black pepper spicy. Afterwards, I had the Heat n' Honey Teriyaki Chicken Wrap, but subbed out the chicken for tofu. I do give them props for making their menu as vegetarian friendly as possible. The tofu tasted great, but it was 70% wrap and 30% filling - not my ideal ratio. It was served with a side of \"cole slaw\" aka shredded cabbage in a balsamic-like dressing. Not exactly what I was expecting. The other option for a side is chips and salsa (no fries? really??). Overall, not a place I would come back to.",

    "text": "I've been meaning to get here and try their food for some time and I am quite happy I finally got the chance. The menu isn't that big, but the selections are great to choose from.  While browsing over the menu to pick out exactly what I wanted to nosh on I had another hard decision to make: what to drink?  They have so much on tap that it's boggling to pick from. 27 I believe. If you're not sure what to try, you can purchase a sampler. For this particular visit I wasn't in the mood for a beer and decided to go for the hard stuff. Now at any typical bar this would be an easy decision to make, but this is not your typical place. I mean who would thought to make a vodka infused with pickles?  Or horseradish even?  I wasn't that daring to try one of those but something did catch my eye. Root beer bourbon. Yes, I did say root beer bourbon. I asked the bartender what was best to mix with it and was advised to try it mixed with ginger ale. Such a wise bartender you are my lady.  It tasted like a root beer float for adults!  Now onto the food. My friend and I ordered finally ordered after all those hard decisions.  We had the fried zucchini as an appetizer. Beer battered is always the way to go. Only bad thing, I think it may have been fried too long. The coating was hard as hell on some parts. I opted for the fish tacos and was not disappointed.  Grilled tilapia with shredded red cabbage and a sauce with cilantro in it. Delicious. Have it a spritz from the lime that came on the side and that made it ever so better.  Each item comes with a side of tortilla chips and salsa.  My friend had the falafel platter and she devoured it.   This place definitely deserves a return visit. And not just because of the food. The staff are so welcoming that you feel the need to return.",

Since then, I have been to Blue Dust on three occasions now and am very impressed.  This restaurant combines reasonably priced food, great craft beer selection, and a friendly atmosphere. Oh and let's not forget the unbelievable Bloody Mary's with your choice of dill or horseradish infused vodka.   I have had the pulled pork tacos and the beef brisket.  Both were excellent and cooked to perfection.  The meat was tender and flavorful with reasonable portions at a good price. The service is always very friendly and timely. This is a great spot to take a date or just a place to stop in for a pint of your favorite craft beer after work.",

After a soul-crushing time slogging through the Waterfront parking lots, this watering hole on the other side of the tracks is an oasis with its plentiful good beers on tap. I was surprised by the lack of burgers, but if you're in the mood for a meaty sandwich the brisket sandwich was devoured by our neighbor at the bar. We opted for the nachos and pork tacos for an abundance of good bar food with a highlight of clearly home-made salsa. The name of the game at Blue Dust is \"home-made\" with their jars of treats sprinkled around the bar from cherry peppers stuffed with cheese and soppressata to bacon-infused vodka.   The atmosphere is bright and clean - with lots of windows and plants - not common for a bar. The bartender's laid-back joking attitude dressed in a floral Hawaiian shirt really set the tone. The crowd for a Saturday lunch was a friendly mix of regulars from all walks of life and ages. Overall, this is a great little neighborhood spot in a struggling neighborhood.",

The fish tacos were amongst the best I've had in Pittsburgh and the China Doll appetizer was superb. They also have decent chips and salsa, a great Portabella mushroom wrap and ginger carrot soup.

    "text": "After hearing about this palace  for a while, I decided to stop in. It was a Saturday night and the place was fairly empty.  We sat ourselves and a waiter came up to us shortly thereafter. I asked for a beer list, but was told that the only beer list was on a chalkboard on a wall in the middle of the restaurant. Not a big deal if it was visible from all of the tables, but it wasn't.  If I wanted to look at it, I had to stand in the middle of the room. Not terrible I suppose, but quite awkward to say the least. Instead of trying to memorize the beer list or continue to stand in the middle of the room, I decided to not have a beer at all. I went for a cocktail, and ordered the blue dust old fashioned. It wasn't very remarkable in any way. While it wasn't bad, it didn't stand out as a signature cocktail for having a bunch of house infused ingredients. I thought it was a bit overpriced for what I got. Our food started off with the spicy China doll app and it was so damn good! The dip had so much flavor!! I had the Pastor taco's and I felt the same about them. They were super flavorful and there was plenty of filling. My girl had the chicken club and it was average as far as chicken clubs go...kinda hard to mess one of those up. Over all it was an average experience Nothing was terrible, but there really wasn't anything that would make me want to go back either.",

They had a ton of awesome beers on tap, I had the Great Lakes Lake Erie monster :). They have house infused vodkas including pickle, expresso and even horse radish.. How unique? We went on a Sunday evening, it was dead. Our server was incredibly friendly. I was surprised by their menu, they had a ton of vegan and vegetarian options even though they are famous for their pulled pork. My boyfriend and I started off with the red bean dip- incredible. Next, we got two house salads- they came with spring greens, almonds and cranberries, nothing too crazy but yet very delicious. My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork sandwich - awesome, really sweet BBQ sauce although I wasn't a huge fan of the aged provolone. I got the veggie wrap with portabellas, zucchini and peppers- messy but amazing.  Overall, this place is awesome and I loved it. I absolutely plan on going back!",

After Yelping it, I realized I was missing out! Who knew this gem stood right next to the Waterfront's railroad tracks!  Tony W. and I finally had a chance to check it out last week for a late Anniversary meal (yes, we're classy like that). The atmosphere was very welcoming. It wasn't that busy so it gave us a relaxed feel. The bar takes up about half of the space and the rest of the area is reserved for tables. They also have a nice outdoor seating area, where that set up about eight to ten tables.   They have such a unique beer list, so we decided on a flight (only $11)! I'm so bad at remembering names, but our favorite was the grapefruit. It was so refreshing! Light, but still enough to get us a little twisted, hehe!   Their menu is unique as well. Everything is very carefully thought out and they offer many vegan/vegetarian options as well as small and dishes/tapas. I ordered the chicken club sandwich with a side of cole slaw. WOW! The sauce and chicken were perfect. They definitely weren't cheap with the meat as they loaded it with thick bacon as well. I wasn't crazy about the cole slaw as it was too vinegar-y.   This is definitely a gem and I hope more people catch on! This is a wonderful alternative to the chain restaurants in the Waterfront. They also offer really great specials throughout the week. I saw a pierogi night! Nice! Can't wait to return!",

Aside from its 20+ beers on tap, Blue Dust offers great food that is not your typical \"bar food.\"   Fried Zucchini: Unlike some of the more typical renditions of this app, the fried zucchini here is thin like a potato chip and is fried in beer batter. Stirfry: Heaping vegetables with brown rice in an Asian-style sauce! Being Asian myself, my standards are pretty high, and I loved this dish here (definitely not authentic, but very tasty!). Smoked Brisket Sandwich: Smoked brisket with BBQ sauce with aged provolone. I thought that the bread:meat ratio was a little off, but the brisket was delicious! It came with a side of tortilla chips and house salsa that was refreshing.  BD is definitely on my list of \"to return\" before I leave Pittsburgh. They also offer other inventive dishes and have rotating specials!",

We tried the grilled avocado with quinoa salad and the special soup - a curried crab bisque.  Either the head chef isn't properly training the line cooks to execute the recipes, or else they're afraid to offend delicate palettes with very flavorful food.    Altogether a disappointing experience.  It wasn't bad, but it could have been so much better.  I'll spend my money on better chef's efforts in future.",

The tables are nothing special and the lighting is dark, so you figure you're at a neighborhood watering hole.  ...but after receiving the menu, I was pretty giddy. Most things are under $10 with a mix of small plates, sandwiches and specials. I went with the \"Porkzilla.\" With a name like that, how can you not?! Advertised on the menu as: house smoked and seasoned pork barbeque smothered with Muenster cheese on Italian bread, it did not disappoint. The pork was succulent and juicy, smokey and with a distinct flavor that you can only attribute to the fact that it was house made.  The salsa they serve the tortilla chips with was also OUT OF THIS WORLD! It had a smokey flavor. I don't think I've ever had smokey flavored salsa before, but I couldn't get enough of it. If they sold bottles of it, I would totally have bought some to take home. Blue Dust = solid choice for pub grub. They also have salads and healthy food options, which was an awesome surprise!",

I got the chicken tacos, which exceeded expectations with a generous portion of spicy yet sweet filling.

I'm a sandwich for dinner kind of gal. Always have been and always will be (low carb shmo carb- give been bread). I absolutely love all of the sandwich options here. Mix & match sliders are yummy and the honey teriyaki chicken wrap is great for those days I want to feel healthy. Also, I LOVE their red cabbage coleslaw. Sandwiches come with a choice of chips and salsa or coleslaw. I always order the coleslaw and they almost always bring me chips and salsa by mistake. This has happened 3 times... And now it's a running joke: Order the coleslaw, get chips and salsa, point out mistake to waitress and BAM! Suddenly I have chips, salsa, AND coleslaw. Can't complain about that spread!  They also offer some great dinner specials  (which are constantly changing) I had their beef brisket over mashed potatoes and it was delightfully delicious.  Bonus: this place infuses their own liquor so there's always something exciting in-house. I've tried their espresso and chai vodkas (one in coffee and one served up White Russian style) and they were both perfect after dinner treats.",

I didn't really care for the slider. It was a little dry to me.  The crab bisque was good.  The coleslaw was really flavorful, and I appreciated that it wasn't made with mayo.  I think that was the best part of the lunch.  Usually the food is the most important part to me, and ambiance is much less important but I really felt awkward during lunch because we were the only people there that day. I think it was around 2 pm so maybe that was why but it still felt a bit un comfortable. I don't want to put too much weight on it though because we might have just been there at an off peak time/day.",

Whatever it is, I'm glad we picked this card from the City Dining Card Deck today!  Blue Dust has a dive bar atmosphere with a classy and sophisticated menu-a True juxtaposition, which I enjoy. Sort of a surprise, especially to those who haven't been yet.   We ordered from a diverse draft selection of several craft beers; their bottle selection is also very respectable, housing domestic and imported craft brews, some of which are normally a little more difficult to find.   The appetizers we ordered were the China Doll Chana Daal dip (lentil mash) and pita bread, and nachos with beef brisket. Both were outstanding! I particularly enjoyed the lentil chana dip (it was covered in fresh onions and tomatoes-great mix)!  Around the table, entrees were ordered that included the pulled pork sandwich, falafel salad, fish tacos, cranberry and walnut salad, and teriyaki chicken wrap. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals, but I will speak for myself when I say that the coleslaw recipe was weird, and not a good kind of weird. It needed more vinegar if that's the way they're going. Also, the chicken in the wrap was a bit overlooked and under sauced  Service was SO right-on. Server's name was Becky. What I loved most was that she knew the draft list and actually contradicted my very knowledgable husband! Loved it! Ha!  Good experience. We will return...again.",

Well, consider yourself told.    The Blue Dust is a dive bar, but not.  They have a casual atmosphere with a great selection of drinks (regular bar stuff, a great craft beer list, plus everything from infused vodkas to seasonal sangrias to $60 glasses of aged bourbon).  The highlight though, is the food.  The menu has their standard fare and then there is usually a page of special items that change seasonally.  These items are out of the box selections that you order just because they are weird, but they delight every time.  All of the food packs a punch of flavor - no bland and boring meals here.  Portions are ample.  Sides are chips/salsa or cole slaw rather than the standard French fry option, which I appreciate.  I love fries and all, but it's nice to have something different.     All in all, the place is a strange combo of dive meets delicious that really works.  It's a go to when I want good food without all the fuss and pretention that you get at a lot of places.",

Not that it's an issue or anything, but my companion and I wondered how awkward it was to spin around to read the draft board. I would have just looked at the taps, but there was enough room between my bar spot and the draft wall that I would have had to get my driving glasses from the car to see them.

I wasn't too hungry so I just shared some fried zucchini with the hubby while our friends both ordered the sliders. I can't speak on the taste of the sliders but they looked ok. The fried zucchini was probably the best I've tasted in a really long time. The zucchini is sliced lengthwise very thinly and it has a very thin batter. This combination makes a very crispy and light fried zucchini which was delightful. They are also generous with the marinara sauce which was a bit on the sweeter side, exactly how I like it.   The atmosphere was really fun. Everyone seemed to be having a great time which makes this place a great place to gather with friends. I will most likely stop here whenever I'm in the Homestead area from now on!",

Date ordered smoke chicken legs, which were huge, and he also got. Aside salad with lemon ginger dressing which tasted amazing.  One complaint I have was with their horseradish pickle martini. It sounds really good but they make it too strong. Due to how powerful those flavors are, they should just enhance the standard martini, not be so powerfully competing that you can't even drink it. They gladly took it back and didn't charge and they were receptive to my feedback.  Only other issue is that there was no toilet paper in the ladies room.  I'd come back and try some other menu items. It's a chill, unpretentious, comfortable place",

The sandwiches are yummy and filling.  We love pierogi night (fresh, homemade with caramelized onions).  We try to eat early because it can be noisy if they have a full house and if you go late on a Tuesday they might run out of pierogies.  The servers are accommodating and friendly.",

    "text": "Sometimes I wait a few visits before I leave a review for a place because I want to know for sure that my reviews live in a state of reality and not hype.  I can honestly say after 5 visits here, Blue Dust is one of my favorite things about Homestead/WaterFront and maybe all of the 412 in general.  This is the type of place that you have to slowly peel back its layers a visit at a time.  Located at the entrance to the Waterfront it's an in your face location but somehow it's still, not!  You walk in it's dark, it's moody, it's someplace that makes you feel like there's more than meets the eye.  Off top they have a huge beer selection both on tap and in the cooler for take home.  IPA's, STOUTS, ALES, PORTERS and more.  Think FatHeads when you think about all the beers they have.  Now you'd think it was just a stellar beer place right?  Well, the food is another peeled back later adding to the allure.  I haven't had a lot of the menu yet and although I plan on continuing to peel back that specific layer, I can say this Falaffel is one of the best I've had around.  For $7.95 this dish is all you'd need to fuel you through the night of long drinking ahead because they got something even more special than beer, house infused vodkas!    Stuff like Honey, Pear, Cardamom; Wild Cherry, WaterMelon, Horseradish and many more that always rotate!  Get a house made mule and make sure you got a designated driver.    The deeper I get into this review, the more I realize I don't want to spoil the experience because I think that's what it is, something you need to take in yourself.  Go enough to where you build a relationship with Gus, then let me know what you think of this place.    This is HITTofMCM and Blue Dust is one of my elite watering holes for the weary mind.",

Like a really great little pub with everything you could hope for when going out for a few drinks and food. The drinks have been flavorful, the beer selection has been extensive, and the food has been interesting and delicious. On other a few other occasions the service has been slow and the food has been disappointing.  We have brought out of town guests to Blue Dust twice now, and they weren't impressed on either of those occasions. My least favorite visit involved being at the restaurant for over an hour and a half (we had no intention of being there so long) during a seeming slow night at Blue Dust. That night we had disappointing and ridiculously boring and tasteless crab sliders, one of their dips, and a fish special that my boyfriend liked but I stopped eating after one bite. I haven't been back since because it really put a bad taste in my mouth (ha!) but I try to hold onto the fact that we had great experiences on more than one occasion.   On those other occasions we've had wonderful (and huge) fish tacos, mushrooms quesadillas, lobster Mac n cheese, super cheap bloody Mary's, flavorful scallops, good beer and unique cocktails. Most occasions the servers have been great and attentive. They also have a nice little outdoor patio area.",

I recently stumbled upon Blue Dust while looking for a place I could get to without my car that wasn't in Squirrel Hill.  Let me start by saying the beer selection was awesome. I have been to quite a few places that are proud of the number of things on tap but fill them with lackluster options. This is not one of those places. The night I went in they had 3(+ depending on your definition) sours. Quite a few IPAs, browns, pales, lagers you name it. And none of the taps had \"regular\" beer (other than I maybe Guinness). The bartenders were very helpful with my selections and very knowledgeable. They were happy to give tasters, go into detail about what they knew about it and suggest new options if you're looking.   I had the brisket sandwich to eat which was very good. I preferred the horseradish to the bbq sauce though it was also good. The red cabbage cole slaw was very good, classic vinegar slaw. They had a large selection of more refined options as well which looked intriguing and inspired me to visit again including portobello arancini (which sounded great but was on special so I'm hoping it's there when I go back).   I gave it a 5 with two (very small) caveats (1) the growler prices were not listed though they advertised a growler bike rack and (2) the differentiation in the specials menu didn't separate starters/appetizers from mains.",

You can get them with slaw or chips and a salsa (reccomended - it's smoky and delicious). They don't have a freezer or a fryer so the food is always fresh and usually lighter than what most restaurants offer. Menu isn't super large but I have never had something that I didn't like. Aside from the fish tacos, my fav thing is 25 cent pierogies on Tuesdays with a $2.50 mystery beer. Their motto is something along the lines of \"no crap on draft\" so you can't go wrong :)   If you can't find something on draft that you like, they have a huge bottle selection. The servers and bartenders are familiar with the different beers and  always helpful if you have trouble deciding.  The only thing that I don't love is the outdoor seating, it's on the same side of the building as the train tracks very close to them and the trains come roaring by pretty frequently.  Regardless, do yourself a favor and drive past the waterfront to come and check out this local gem.",

You can watch local sports on the several big screen TVs inside or you can sit outside on a couple of tables they have and watch the very loud trains go by. If your train fan, This is a great spot. I believe it is called blue dust because it is in the former steel mill Area along the Monongahela River. The workers would be covered in the blue dust when they got home from work. Definitely recommend it. Try the east and monkey boy If they still have it on tap when you arrive.",

There were some other places we were looking to eat at but looking at their reviews here we saw that it was up and down so we gave them a shot.       On yelp it says they have a private parking lot and they do but it isn't too big.  We drove in and it was full so we had to find street parking about 5 minutes away walking.  We walked in and it was busy but we found two seats at the bar.  I thought it smelled funny in there.  Looking around and getting situated I figured out we were just really at a bar that had a food menu.         We were greeted by the bartender and ordered a few beers.  The beer that we wanted just kicked but we found a couple ones that we liked.  We knew what we wanted already because we looked at the menu beforehand.  My wife got the fish tacos and I ordered the brisket tacos.  They both came with either coleslaw or chips and salsa.  At first it was loud in here but people started leaving and it was only about half full by the time our food came.         Our food came out and it looked good.  They gave me coleslaw by mistake so they went back to get me some chips and salsa.  The salsa was ok.  My wife's taco was really runny.  She tipped it over and a lot of liquid came out of it.  She had to get another plate.  I did like my brisket tacos.  3 out of 5 I would rate my tacos.  The meat was a little dry but the flavors were all there.  Once all of the liquid was out of my wife's tacos I think she liked them too but they were really average.  We were hungry...       So we would come back here to have a drink if there wasn't anything else open.  I think the customer service was good.  They made sure our food was good.   It's a bar which is fine but I really wouldn't recommend eating here for dinner.",

We stopped for some appetizers before heading to Kennywood a few weeks ago. We got there around 12:20pm - it wasn't busy- so we got seated right away.   I ordered the bourbon cocktail to drink - it was delicious! I might have ordered more than one! They also have a wonderful draft list of yours in the mood for a beer.   For an appetizer- I split the nachos & the fried zucchini with one of my co-workers. They were both delicious & we ate them all up. I would definitely order them again, but I would love to try the tacos!   I will definitely be back to visit Blue Dust again soon! If you're in the area - you definitely have to check it out!",

I feel like most of what I've heard about Blue Dust is about their fantastic house cocktails. They make infusions and syrups in house, and use good liquor.  The seasonal Pumpkin Chai Martini was a highlight on my trip: A Dessert drink at its finest, the drink was smooth but strong.  I also went half for half on wraps with my boyfriend... We split the Heat and Honey Teriyaki Chicken Wrap and the Portobello Wrap. He opted for the house tortilla chips and salsa, and I went for the coleslaw. The wraps were both fairly good, although we both wished they had been a bit bigger. The coleslaw was very tasty, and vinegar based instead of mayo based (my preference!)  All in all, the experience was a good one. Our waiter was a bit elusive, but to be fair, we were here around 2 PM... So maybe it was just off timing on our part?  I'd recommend Blue Dust if you're in the area and craving good cocktails and lovingly prepared food.",

    "text": "Decent amount of drafts listed on their draft menu, too bad they were out of a few, most specifically the ones I was leaning to.  I can't say my first impression of this place was overall positive and that impression lasted through out our entire experience spanning ever part of our visit.   Boasting 20+ draft list was probably the most impressive thing about this place.  It was very busy on a Saturday around 6.  We found some vacant bar stools on the one end of the bar.  We quickly snagged them up and from there things progressively got worse.  The stools were in bad shape.  Ripped, wobbly, and sticky.  There was a urine smell to the place.  I can't say if it was because the bathrooms were behind us or if someone had pissed in the corner the night before.  Where ever it was coming from it was off putting.  We ordered a round of drinks once we narrowed down what they had and got the attention of the bustling bartender.  Our initial bartender was very nice but she left shortly after we got there and was replaced by who I believe was either an owner or manager combo man and women team that were not as friendly.  We were very hungry having come there not just for a drink but dinner before seeing a show up the road.  I ordered the fish tacos and my husband also got tacos.  They came out quickly and really looked great!  Until I picked them up...  Talk about using frozen fish and not getting the water out.  Water was pouring out of the tacos like a fountain.  This wasn't a drip, it was more of a pool.  I tilted my water laden taco toward the plate and watched for a minute as my taco drained onto the plate below.  Bartenders must have seen me doing this, as I had to ask for another plate, but never made one comment to me.  I was so irritated but still very hungry and did not want to send my food back based on time constraints and quite honestly I believed I would probably not receive any better food.  After I filled a whole plate with fish water I salvaged what I could from this dish and ate my meal.  It was not very good.    To sum up the evening I had to use the restroom.  Odd setup of a smelly bathroom topped with a heavy and quick to slam bathroom door that clipped my heals and smacked my butt on the way out.   Yea I don't think we will be back.",

It was chock full of shredded crab, and the base is reminiscent of Mrs Grass' broth, mixed with a warm (but not overpowering) curry accent. My S/O and I ordered the brisket tacos to share, and they actually brought it out as a split plate..what service! The brisket was tender, juicy and flavorful and mixed well with the toppings of shredded cheese and crema sauce. Add to that the large selection of awesome craft beers, and this is definitely a place I'll be returning to! Wish I could post a picture of the delicious food, but after one bite here it's hard to stop till the plate is empty!",

It is decently small inside and looks like a dive bar (almost), but their menu is what sets them apart from being just some bar that serves food. I was not a huge fan of the atmosphere at first but I gave it a chance.   Fridays are busy and I was really surprised that when I was trying to order food and drinks, half of the things I ordered were sold out. Like completely gone! That is why I gave it this rating.   I got a falafel platter and it was so dry. The falafel balls themselves were quite good but it was served with giant wedges of vegetables and dry, bland pita. The appetizers were great though. I wanted the artichoke dip but ended up getting the chana daal dip, which was soooo delicious. I would love to go back and try to taste what they didn't have. Maybe an updated review will happen at a later time.",

Server was super nice, and the environment was very laid back bar environment.  Not too loud/rowdy and not too quiet.

I loved the beer selection and the atmosphere - so why not more stars? The execution of my sandwich, ordered off the specials list, left a little to be desired. Smoked chicken and white barbeque sauce? Yes, please. But rye bread as the carrier meant that the lovely smoke and sauce was overwhelmed with all rye, all the time, and there were no other accompaniments (lettuce, tomato) to mediate.  Ordering off the specials menu anywhere can be a gamble, because they're often dishes in the process of being refined, rather than tried-and-True stalwarts. My husband's brisket, a menu standard, was delicious.  I'll definitely go back, because I want to eat at a place that's both comfortable and inventive - even if it's not perfect.",

Turning towards the door you notice an area to play darts and Rock'em Sock'em Robots (epic).  Turning in the other direction you notice the myriad of refrigerators full of quality beer.  Similarly, there are a dozen or so beers on tap, all of which are top notch.  Also, they have bacon bourbon and it is crazy.  The menu is very simple, containing a few staple appetizers, salads, small plates, and sandwiches.  The gold, however, is in the monthly specials.  The first time I ever visited Blue Dust they had braised short ribs as the special--short was a loose term, very loose term.  If I had to guess, I'd say each rib weighed a half pound each and I was served three, and all of the meat was falling off the bone.  The February special is pulled mutton; the only other time I've had mutton was at Blue Dust.  Both times were fantastic.  If you want a special, go a week or so into the month until the last few days of the month.  I've gone when they were still waiting on ingredients on the first of the month and after they'd run out of some towards the end of the month.  Tuesdays are pierogie night.  They're made in-house, are amazing, and sell out.  My only complaint is their salsa served with their sandwiches is strange.  Not my style, but maybe somebody likes it.  Go there, grab a brew, and chow down.  You won't regret it.",

Yelp lists this as a \"Gastropub\"; based off of that definition and the consistent 4-star rating I was expecting much more.  The Tuesday night special $0.25 pierogis were definitely the highlight.  The other food I ordered ranged from not good to not great.  The arancini were extremely greasy.  The curry crab bisque was strange (and not a bisque by my standards,) and the salad was basically lettuce with some craisins thrown on top (no almonds as advertised.)  If I were to return, I'd get a plate of pierogis and call it a day.  However, it's unlikely that I would.  As I mentioned earlier, they have some really interesting infused vodkas so my recommendation would be to eat elsewhere and stick with the booze.",

    "text": "One of the more nuanced beer selections in Pittsburgh.  This is THE place to be during PGH beer week. Of special note is the infused vodkas.  I had a bloody mary and boy howdy was it great.  Freshly made with homemade horseradish infused vodka.  HOOK IT UP TO MY VEINS.    It's probably the best bloody mary I have ever had.  And to think, at a dumpy bar next to the railroad tracks!  This is why Pittsburgh is such a magical place.  So unassuming but BAM POW something amazing somewhere humble.   The bacon bourbon was also superlative.  Do get the maple syrup in it (just a touch, the bartender will add the perfect amount) it gives it more depth and balances out the salt.  Unfortunately what really kills Blue Dust for me is the food.  The food is not good.   IT IS PAINFULLY AVERAGE.  I was grateful for my sandwich after a few beers but I was astonished to discover that they served CANED SALSA AND TORTILLA CHIPS FROM A BAG as my side.  Not even fresh chips? Not even fries?    Christ on a crutch, that's bad.  The sandwich itself was warm and melty and full of supermarket quality meat.  It lacked flavor, however it was completely inoffensive and a vehicle to deliver carbs, cheese and meat to my gullet.  I go back every chance I get for the new infused vodkas and the ever changing beer.  A hidden gem.",

What wasn't okay was the sewer smell as you came through the door, but at least that disappeared once past the vestibule.  We bellied up to the bar all ready to experience an infusion or two- how could we resist after all we'd heard? It was early evening on a Saturday...no horseradish infused, no jalapeno infused, but they had pickle infused vodka...sounded good! Eh...not even close to a great bloody Mary. It was adequate.   The bartender chick with the sideways ballcap recommended the chai infusion in a white Russian to my companion. Wow that sounded amazing! In actuality it was overly sweet, overly creamy (yes, that's possible) and simply not a well-made cocktail. It was big. That was a shame because a drinking glass full went almost untouched....and the ballcap chick never inquired why.   We paid our check and left. Nothing of the first round enticed us to stay for another. The atmosphere? Eh. That kind of summarizes the whole experience. Maybe if you don't expect much, you won't be disappointed. We were.",

My boyfriend and I arrived at 7:15pm on $0.25 pierogi night but they were already sold out of pierogies, despite the fact that the place only appeared to be half full. It left us feeling like the 25 cent pierogies were a cheap advertising gimmick to get people in the door and then order much more expensive food off the menu.  Speaking of food, the turkey on my boyfriend's ruben sandwich was dry and the bread was meh. He said that the only good thing about it was that it was huge. My group's nachos were burned black on one side and my grilled cheese sandwich was so rich that it wasn't edible for more than a few bites. Don't get me wrong, I love me some cheese, but the thick layer of goat cheese combined with a healthy dose of two other cheeses made for a sandwich that dries out your mouth and leaves you super thirsty. Also, it hadn't been cooked long enough to melt any of the cheese, and didn't have any basil on it as described on the menu.   The service was pretty bad - it took about 15 minutes for anyone to come take our order, and then our waiter forgot about our drinks. He was also difficult to flag down, which was understandable given how busy the place got throughout the night. I wouldn't have been so annoyed by the bad service if our group hadn't been charged the mandatory 18% gratuity after being told our checks couldn't be split. If you're going to charge a mandatory gratuity, at least provide that level of service! We left feeling like our waiter didn't bother because he knew he'd be getting an 18% tip.",

I'd heard a lot about this place as well as read just about every review on Yelp and newspaper reviews. I wasn't sure what to expect, but a dark, dank, Burgh bar wasn't it.   I was highly impressed with the bar, any brand of vodka, flavored, proof, etc, bacon bourbon, and a nice selection of beers. I had a black IPA, which was awesome with the Spicy China Doll (a thick pasty bean dip that could have used a bit of salt) served with very good tortilla chips that's weren't a bit greasy. For Dinner I had a portobello wrap, it was nice and meaty but lacked basic salt and pepper seasoning.  Neither the app or wrap really stood out in my mind.   The fish tacos are some of the best in the burgh. Moist grilled tilapia are wrapped around soft flour tortillas, drizzled with cilantro creme and nested in crunchy cabbage. Delicious! Served up with an oil and vinegar slaw that works well with the tacos. Pair it up with a wheat beer or classic IPA for some serious eats.",

For example they are offering pumpkin hummus as well as Fisherman's Stew during these falling temperatures. One of my favorite dishes is their version of \"surf and turf\". It is done as two halves of sandwiches-one half being crab cake and the other being brisket. There is very little filler in the crab cakes and the brisket is very tasty. Their homemade salsa is really good too.  Try it!!!  Great beer and great food!",

It's a really big bar inside - no separation of bar and dining area.  The service was great and the music was LOUD at first, then somewhat softer (better).  Arsenal Cider on tap - always a plus!  Yes, please!  Although I wanted the \"land and sea\" I've read so much about, it just seemed too big, so I opted for the grilled three cheese sandwich with slaw.  The sandwich was fabulous and had basil - which I liked a lot (also tomato which was plucked 'n chucked as is the case with most tomatoes in February).  Companion had the portabella wrap with chips and salsa - also a hit.  The service was happy and as attentive as necessary for a quick bite.  There are large windows behind the bar and 3-4 times through our short visit the trains roared past.  Now this is a part of Pittsburgh and the surrounding area I love - the trains!  So that was a plus for me, but maybe not for everyone (might play a part in the music volume, too).  Definitely would go back - next time skipping lunch or going to a late movie, as the \"land and sea\" is softly singing in the back of my mind.",

The atmosphere is pretty dive-y, but the food is delicious! They also have a really awesome selection of beer on tap. Be warned, the Blue Dust slogan is \"no crap on tap\" and they aren't kidding. Don't expect to find any Budweiser, Miller, Coors, or Yuengling on tap here. They did have Guinness on tap, and you can take that for what it is. Draft prices are pretty reasonable (around $6), especially compared to other places on the Waterfront with decent beer (Burgatory, Rock Bottom).   I started with one of the soups of the day, curry crab bisque, and was blown away. It was spicy and flavorful with some decent crab. I ordered a bowl and the portion was really generous--bigger than the bowls in my own kitchen. My boyfriend got the grilled chicken appetizer with barbeque sauce and was impressed with the quality of the chicken and sauce.  For my lunch I got the 3 cheese sandwich, which comes with fresh basil and tomato. I asked if they could add onion and they did so for free. It was very good, but not great. I guess it's hard to blow people away with a cheese sandwich, so no worries. My boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich (\"porkzila\") and loved it. He said he intends to go back and order the same thing. A friend was also impressed with his hot italian sandwich, which looked to have a generous portion of meat and cheese. Sandwiches come with either chips and salsa or cole slaw (the vinegar kind, not the mayo kind). The salsa is a basic pico, but I really liked it. I didn't try the cole slaw.   I liked this place a lot and will definitely go back to try some of their other options. Reasonably priced beer on tap is enough of a draw by itself.",

Opening in 2009, I just found them 2 months ago.   Tonight I am having the falaffel.  Now don't be thinking I am a connisoure of this cusine. The dish is tender and nicely spiced. Do you like smoked meats? The briscuit is awesome. $0.25 pierogies on Thursday with half priced berets and $1.00 haluski are the bomb. Check out the daily specials from my photo.

    "text": "Recently I came across an opportunity that necessitated a rapid beer education.  A few of my beer drinking friends offered to help me out.  The first place we went to was the Blue Dust in Homestead, PA.  It's a small place, located on Amity Street just over the tracks from the area known as the Waterfront.  It is possible that a few of my friends sensed that I was growing cold feet because I was gently assured that they had many different types of beer and that the food was good.  Oh, and Tuesdays are .25 pierogi!  In Pittsburgh, if you don't eat and love pierogi you are unceremoniously tossed out of town on your ear.  Everyone here loves the little noodle dumplings stuffed with mashed potatoes and sauteed in butter and onions.    Pittsburgh is also known for its steel mills even though nowadays there are very few operating mills and the city is very clean compared to what it used to be.  Blue Dust pays a respectful homage to our city's roots with a mural painted on its walls depicting the mills bathed in a gentle golden glow.  Dinner arrived after we had only tasted a few beers which was a good thing because it was quickly becoming vital that some of us needed a bit of solid nourishment in our stomachs before proceeding. I ordered a chili cheese dog that came with a side of chips and salsa.  The dog was a hebrew national hot off the grill with just the right amount of char for that summer barbecue taste.  Lacking beans and spice, the chili was a little disappointing.  I can appreciate the Blue Dust's decision to exclude the beans but the chili unfortunately was as dull and lifeless as chili served in a high school cafeteria.  I do wish the cheese had been cheddar of the sharp variety rather than cheddar of the giant bland bagged variety. The onions were crisp and tried valiantly to provide the kick that the chili was lacking.  The chips and salsa were similarly delicious and mediocre.  The chips were well salted and had the slightest green taste to them that would have went perfect with excellent salsa.  As it was, the salsa while house made and bursting with freshness, lacked the same thing as the chili.  It was completely without any attitude.  This was salsa for toddlers...not really fit for beer drinking men (and women!).  The pierogi were delicious.  Small and handmade by someone's babcia (I do hope I got the word correct for that--my Italian genes would prefer to say 'nonna'), the pierogi were lovingly stuffed with the just the right amount of mashed potatoes and carefully sauteed in butter with onions until the onions began to take on just the smallest amount of sweetness and the edges of the pierogi began to turn a delicate shade of golden brown.  Hoegarden, Rogue Hazelnut, Lagunitas WTF, Duck Rabbit Milk Stout, Dragons Blood, Corona, Fiery Monk, Oberon. Merry Monk, Voodoo Cowbell, Fat Gary, Guiness, Dogfish, IPA, and Golden Draak were some of the beers we tasted as the evening wore on.  Certainly we left many, many more unsampled!  Go for the beer, drink freely.  Go for the food, but choose wisely.  The hot dogs and the pierogi are your best bet.

There's a lot behind the Blue Dust for customers but it's not easily viewed upon driving past.",

    "text": "Blue Dust: A Family Affair  We all have that uncle in our family, you know, the one that headlines every epic family reunion.  Wouldn't it be sweet if your favorite uncle opened a bar? Well look no further my foodie friends!  Uncle Jerry is serving up craft brews and mouth-watering dinner plates at Blue Dust.  Whether you're a Homestead-lifer or a curious first-timer, you'll feel like part of the family in no time.   I'm not sure what I was expecting the first time I entered Blue Dust, a name that pays tribute to the steel industry, but I was pleased from the start.  It isn't \"cold\" or industrial in style; rather, it's homey and has a bit of a southwest feel.  If you prefer sitting tableside there are various spots to eat comfortably both inside and outside (weather permitting).  Honestly though, in a local bar such as this, you're going to want to sit at the bar and participate.   Besides, the bar itself is quite lovely, Jerry Miller's daughter, Sarah, created a work of art using blue mosaic glass.  If you look closely, you might see the sea monster at the end of the bar.   Once seated at the bar, you can take a gander at the row of craft taps waiting for you to imbibe upon...26 to be exact.  Therefore, if your beer of choice is produced by those Clydesdale lovers (man, those commercials get me every time), you are better off elsewhere.  Blue Dust is for patrons who actually like to savor the flavors of brews like Eylsian Immortal IPA at 6.2% or Sierra Nevada's Imperial Red at 8.1%.  If you don't see a draft you love...um, I guess that's possible...they have a wide range of bottles in the wall coolers too.  And if beer isn't your thing, or you need something stiffer to ease the woes of a long workday, Frank (Jerry's son-in-law), will make you a mean cocktail.  Frank may stir up something using their house-flavored vodka or...

I thought the best part of the meal was the coleslaw. The restaurant has a very laid back feel, and serves mostly just sandwiches. We wish they had a choice of fries or salad as a side instead of chips.",

I had no idea that there was such a great place sitting there, and I was truly impressed.  The food is fantastic and the selection is pretty healthy and all natural. I also loved the beer selection, and the prices were great. The service at the bar was wonderful, and I'm definitely going to make this a future grub stop at the Waterfront in the future!",

They had a great variety of beers on tap and food selection was far above your typical bar menu.  Next time I want to try some of the house infused vodkas. I had the Blue Dust salad, it was delicious and under 10$! What a bargain.  A GREAT alternative to all the chain places in the waterfront.",
