    "text": "My  husband and I recently went here for breakfast and absolutely loved it. The service was excellent and we both thought the food was great. He got an omelet and I got the OMG breakfast and we enjoyed all of it! Since it was our first time, the waitress recommended trying the French Toast and it was delicious but huge! Cinnamon-y and it also had a crispness to the edges of the toast - yum! I also decided to try the sausage but keep in mind if you like hot sausage, that it comes in one large patty and the sweet sausage comes as two smaller patties. Both types were very good. Since our first visit, we have been back two more times and both times were great experiences all the way around. We brought our 7-year old with us for breakfast and the server was very attentive and friendly especially to our daughter. I was surprised to see so many low reviews on here for Kelly O's but our family really enjoy the place and wish it was open longer hours. This is now our go-to place for breakfast rather than settling for Eat n Park or Original Pancake House.",

I ordered the Haluski and the turkey pot pie soup.  My wife's biscuit and sausage gravy and my turkey pot pie soup came from the kitchen cold. We got a new order of the biscuit and sausage gravy which was VERY watery and I canceled my soup order.  The eggs and home fries were acceptable (how hard can it be to mess that up) and the Huluski was pretty bland.  Overall, we were quite unimpressed.",

But if you're craving diner food and you're in the area, I'd say this place is a solid choice for some breakfast food.    I'm always craving pancakes, so that's how we ended up at this place.  We're not usually up in that area, so we turned to yelp and found this place.  From the outside, the place definitely doesn't look like anything special, or even a diner really since it's located in a shopping center.  Once inside, it's your basic diner decor with lots of booths and that feeling that every surface has a thin film of grease.  But hey, it's a diner, what do you expect.  Pancakes were good, as was the other breakfast foods we ordered.    The main complaint I have is that the coffee WAS SO WATERY.  I mentioned it to the waitress who said that they had noticed that this last batch of coffee wasn't right and that she'd bring me a new cup.  Second cup came and it was still watery...",

As for the mush...that stuff was no bueno.  I like polenta, but I didn't like that.  I got it Guy's way with the bacon, didn't help.  Overall, it's a nice diner with a laid back atmosphere.  Good service, but mediocre food.  And unless you are a diehard polenta eater, stay away from the mush.",

My boyfriend and I are in town from NC and last minute decided to go get breakfast here. It was 2:50 (ten minutes before close) when we arrived. We walked in and one male server with blonde hair sarcastically chuckled (how welcoming...) because the other server was going to be taking care of us so close to closing time. Our server, \"Staci\" had an attitude from start to end. How she has a job baffles me. Throws down our silverware and asks what we want, we ask for another minute, she comes back and says \"what are you getting?\" As if we can't have one more second to look at the menu....brings out food with one less piece of toast stating the other piece got burnt but then brought out another burnt piece as a substitute..weird. She doesn't come back over until we are finished and just throws the check down. We wrote a note on the bill explaining how we work in the restaurant industry and she would've got a 100% tip if she didn't act so rudely. I hope the owners find new servers who will treat the customers right and appreciate having a job.",

Along with my food came a new waiter who wasn't the friendliest person or the most attentive. By the end of the meal, I had to get up to ask for my check because it took so long, abd it ended up being the wrong bill.

I'm a sucker for the breakfast sandwich and any of their pancakes - especially the pumpkin ones they whip up in the fall.   The spot itself is tucked into a little strip mall complex, ironically the same one that my gym is in (for extra guilt, I suppose). It can get pretty swamped on the weekends, so I recommend either getting there early or visiting on a weekday. You're not getting white glove service here, and it's certainly not a mimosas and crumpets joint, but the staff is friendly, the food is solid, and the kitchen looks pretty clean.

I got the \"World Famous Breakfast\" which consisted of two eggs, homefries or shredded potatoes, bacon or sausage and toast.  I got the homefries with green peppers and onions and felt that they were absolutely amazing.  Crispy, but not burnt.  Peppers and onions were a perfect addition and really shouldn't be missed.  The bacon was crispy, not greasy and limp.  And the toast is Mancini's, and if there's one thing I love, it's Mancini's.  Was the breakfast super creative and out of the box as far as a concept?  No.  But was it perfectly executed and the ideal picture of a good diner breakfast?  Yes!  Loved the decor inside with the great diner feel.  My only complaint really was the booths.  My church pews at my Catholic elementary school were probably more comfortable.  Straight up and down in the back, no padding, and very narrow.  Two medium adults JUST fit.  If you're big boned and try to fit two people in there, it's not going to be pretty.  Overall, will DEFINITELY be back.  Love the food, service, the Pittsburgh love throughout.",

On the HUGE plus side, everything else here is great.  Yes, the decor is wacky and dated, but the food is spot-on.  Get the french toast on Mancini's bread, and you won't be disappointed.  Or, get the grilled sticky bun; your arteries may hate you, but your mouth will be in heaven.  My personal favorite, though, is just their eggs/sausage patty/hash brown breakfast.  The sausage is a hand-made patty, so you can't go wrong with it.",

    "text": "At best a three star and only because my breakfast sandwich was actually delicious and not greasy at all. The eggs were light and fluffy and the bread they use is just so good. Although they could cut back on the butter slightly.  The negatives? Well there are MANY!!! First the place looks like a dump, the tables were dirty, the waitstaff simply put, looked unclean. Our \"waitress\" was rude and acted as though we were an inconvenience to her, this is her job mind you.  We ordered two identical egg sandwiches (again delicious, props for having dynamite food), two glasses of water and a coffee. Now the most disgusting thing was not that she pulled the creamer off the dirty table behind me and served it to me, or that it was warm when she did, but in fact it had CURDLED and had huge chucks in it. Needless to say, I very nicely asked for a new one. Without even apologizing she grabbed it off the table and brought me another one, ALSO CURDLED AND CHUNKY...I decided to drink my horrid coffee, black at this point ,and when I drew the waitresses attention just to let her know the stock might be bad, she got in my face and proceeded to \"explain\" to me, that this is what it looks like, as she just poured it from the fridge. Then when I expressed my apologies for not knowing that \"this is how coffee creamer is\", yeah right lady...I was just grossed out by her horrible dentition and breath, and wanted her to back out of my face...then I asked for some whole milk, hoping that wasn't also curdled. She threw the milk on the table in a 2oz plastic container, like you would use for sauces...she never came back to refill my coffee, or check on us.  Even I can make an egg sandwich delicious, so I would skip this place and the curdled milk and rude waitress it comes with.  Pittsburgh, you can do better!",

Another 10 to get our order taken, and when our food finally came, we had no silverware to eat with. Other 5 minutes to get that, and finally we could eat.  Don't think this isn't the norm, it is. I told my fiance that this is the last time we come here. I'm over it. As for price, two coffee's, a veggie omelet, and breakfast tacos $20. Overpriced, underwhelmed, and poor service, don't mix.

I usually tend to get the Mixed Grill for breakfast, most often with the addition of ham (you can add a choice of meat to the mixed grill for an upcharge).  I usually don't get cheese on top, but this past Saturday, January 18, I did.  My only complaint was that all the cheese wasn't melted.  Still, the Mixed Grill was satisfying and generally done very well.  My frequent breakfasting partner got his usual, the Outrageous Breakfast sandwich.  This sandwich is very large, and comes on (the best!) Mancini toast.  He always raves about it, and this is someone who is a bit of a foodie.  Overall a great breakfast experience!",

After the waitress described mush as fried polenta, I ordered the meatloaf and turkey pot pie soup. Meatloaf was average with mashed potatos that may have been from powder. Turkey pot pie soup was almost certainly reheated, creamy and pretty nondescript. Overall nothing stood out about the food.  Service was good and parking plentiful. I would't go out of my way, but if in the neighborhood and hungry, Kelly O's may be a good spot to stop by.",

We went to sit down at a booth and were asked not to sit there \"because we just cleaned that side for tomorrow.\"  So we sat on the other side.  Before we were asked what we wanted to drink she asked in a rushed and annoying tone \"Well is this going to be cash or credit?\" I told her \"I don't know\".  She walked away and said something under her breath that I couldn't hear.  She came back about 30 seconds later with our utensils and asked \"what do you want?\".  I said \"i don't know yet.\" So she leaves us for a few minutes and comes back then takes our order.  Food was average at best.  Food is comparable to a Kings or Eat-N-Park except the space is small and dirty.  If the waitress was a sweet girl that didn't act like a total bitch the experience would have been what I expected...an ok burger in a little diner.  Not great, not bad...but good enough.  But, this girl was the worst waitress I've ever had in my life.  Long dark hair, brown eyes and an absolute bitch.  How can this place employ someone like this is beyond my comprehension.  If she's this miserable with only one table what is she like when that dump is packed on a Sunday morning?    Do yourself a favor and avoid the Kelly O's diner on Perry Highway!    Oh, and don't bother using the bathroom that literally is in the middle of the kitchen.  We went in to wash our hands before our meal and right as you open the bathroom door which is just a few feet from where they grill your food is the toilet.  I opened the door and inside the toilet was a monster turd that someone didn't flush.  I can only assume that the classless person that decided not to flush that log down the toilet was none other than our bitchy waitress.   SUMMARY:  Waitress was a bitch and acted so annoyed and bothered that we were in there.  Restaurant was dirty.  Only bathroom is in the kitchen.  I hope the owner reads this review and fires that waitress. I'm sure there are many people in the area that could use a job and would do a much better job than this girl.  If you don't fire her then at least stop letter her eat for free so she doesn't leave any more huge shits in the toilet for all the customers to ponder.  Good Lord what the hell are you people thinking?  Something tells me Guy from Diner Drive-In's and Dives didn't get treated like shit by a super annoyed waitress...",

    "text": "I probably would come back because I really liked the pot pie soup; however, I think everything is overpriced for what you're getting.  It was good, but it wasn't $50 for a family of four to eat good.  I could have gotten similar flavors at Eat n Park for half the price.  Price aside, I would have given four stars if it wasn't for the service.  We did go around church rush time but man, our waitress was in a rotten mood it seemed.  It took 5-10 minutes after seating to get our table cleaned off.  Drink and food were even slower.  This is understandable.  I don't fault servers when I'm there during busy times.  (Unless I see servers standing around doing nothing while my table needs cleared.)  The thing that really bothered me was the waitress correcting my six-year-old about something she was doing.  My daughter was squeezing lemon into her milk because that's what kids do... they experiment.  I tell my kids if you want to do it, that's fine... but you will eat/drink whatever it is you just did.  She was going to drink it until the waitress told her \"don't do that, you'll make your milk curdle\".    Sure, science dictates that milk will curdle with lemon (and usually with greater quantities I think... 2 tbl lemon juice to 1 cup of milk I think to make sour milk for baking?).... but it happens at much slower with cold milk.  If the milk was hot, hell yeah it would have been a problem within five minutes.  Um, seriously?  So then I had a six-year-old meltdown on my hands and glass of milk I paid for she won't drink.... that she would have otherwise.  And guess what, it didn't curdle the entire hour we were sitting there waiting through slow service.  Note to servers:  Unless the children are being raised by douchey parents who are letting them climb up your walls and are obnoxious to other guests, let them do what they're doing.  And if you're going to correct them doing something rather harmless, you better be prepared to comp me the drink you just ruined with unneeded comments.",

Eggs were fresh and the rye toast we had was also served hot and was excellent. Zero complaints about food or service!

We met up at Ross Park Mall to carpool to renaissance fair  and decided to stop here for breakfast on the way to fair.  I ordered my usual-- breakfast burrito with shredded potatoes. It's so tasty i just dont even want to try anything else, lol. My friend ordered an omelet and we split their \"famous cinnamon roll\"  We may just stick to the strip for our Kelly O's experience. When ordering drinks, we asked for coffee and water. No water but honestly no big deal. It also took a veryyyyyyy long time for our food. My friend just came back from a 2 week trip to Paris. We talked about the entire trip before our food came out, lol. Also, we both asked for onions and peppers in our potatoes and neither of us had any.   I can let the food wait time slide. I went to the restroom which is surprisingly in the kitchen. The kitchen is pretty small and only a few cooks. There seemed to be more tables than the strip district one so i can understand the wait time. The food was tasty so in a sense that's what matters. But if it looks busy and you're pressed for time, this may not be the best option.   We are still obsessed with Kelly O's... but the strip district location.",

It was awful, and there is no other way to describe it. The sole upside to the whole experience was the grilled cinnamon roll. These things SHOULD be famous. Other than that, not much is going right here. Bad service, bad environment, bad food. Safe to say that this diner is just overrated due to Guy Fieri's visit here.

    "text": "Pittsburgh Bound!  Part XII  (For Part XI, go to: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/review_share/lKom12WnYEjH5FFemK3M1Q/review/k97SGRvnhBMrHzqofs1WNg?fsid=UxXDThIqZWoW2rLLTPYxIg\">yelp.com/review_share/lK...</a>)  Everywhere I've Yelped about Pittsburgh thus far have been places I've been to before many times over, so I thought that on my last day in town, I would try some new places that I've never been to before but have always said that I should try.  First stop, Kelly O's.  The diner, buried in a nondescript strip mall about 20 minutes north of the city was featured on Diner's, Drive-In's, and Dives back in 2009, but by the looks of it, you'd think they film full episodes there three times a year.  From the moment you enter the building, you are slapped in the face with the fact that a 5-year old, 7 minute video exists in time and space.  Signs around the bar, \"As seen on...\" coffee mugs, \"Daily Triple-D specials\", a menu item that reads \"the way Guy F likes it\", and so on.  I understand hanging on to the glory, but it's a lot like that douche that shows up at your 20-year high school reunion still wearing his letterman jacket and reminiscing about the only game he ever scored in.  When I watch Diner's, Drive-In's, and Dives, I typically see owners and chefs who pride themselves in their hands-on, scratch-made creations with some \"dives\" actually growing their own herbs, and curing their own bacon; taking sincere pride in providing a quality meal.  I have to assume that if they had made the cut for Food Network, they must be doing something right.  I was a little disappointed.  The service was good, and the coffee was fantastic, but it pretty much ended there.  My friend and I each received our meals, and it was clearly obvious that her omelet was made with powdered eggs, and the mushrooms pouring out of it were right out of a can.  I'm not a professional chef by any means, but my friend is, and we both agreed that there is almost nothing in the world easier to cook than mushrooms.    I ordered steak and eggs and ended up with an under-seasoned steak (which was actually cooked well), and shredded potatoes which were fairly uncooked below the crusty surface.  The saving grace of the meal was the Mancini bread which, for those that don't know, is a primo Italian bread made locally.  Before I left, I ran to the restroom, which is adjacent to the kitchen.  I'm always fearful of diner kitchens that are hidden out of site, but theirs was clean and the staff was busting ass with a full griddle of eggs, pancakes and meats.    For me, Kelly O's was a nice, local diner, but there was nothing that really stood out to me as overly special.  I guess the Triple D thing got me in the door in the first place, so marketing it must be doing something right, but seriously, lighten up on it a little.  (PS:  I watched the clip of the show when I got home, and they made Haluski, a Polish staple, and I'm pretty sure any novice cook could replicate it to a tee making me even more confused as to how this place entered Guy Fieri's gravity.)

Although the sandwich and service were both fine, I was surprised to see I was charged $2.00 extra for the lettuce and tomato I ordered on my sandwich.  Maybe this was written somewhere in the fine print of the menu, but regardless, $1.00 for 1 leaf of lettuce, and another $1.00 for 1 sickly slice of tomato?  Had our waitress or cashier asked me how everything was, I would have shared my thoughts with them directly, and not been compelled to write this review.  As it stands, I feel gouged, and will not return.",

The Mush with crumbled bacon, the way Guy from Triple D's likes it was good. Finally I had the Pittsburgher - 1/3 lb burger, pierogi, Polish Sausage, and cheese. Quite good but the Polish Sausage was 2 very small pieces.   The diner is quite noisy so you may need some quiet time to decompress.",

Maybe I had high expectations or I didn't order the right things. I ordered the Pittsburgh Benedict and the hubby ordered the hot turkey sandwich. My Pittsburgh Benedict was decent, creative version of your traditional eggs benedict. Instead of Canadian bacon or ham, it had kielbasa along with a pierogi and sauteed onions. I enjoyed it but the hot turkey sandwich was a disgrace. It should be a diner staple so I'm not sure how Kelly O's managed to mess it up. The turkey was so dry; you might as well have called it a turkey jerky sandwich. We asked for cranberry sauce because the sandwich was drier than the Sahara, but of course they didn't have any. When someone can make a better turkey sandwich at home using oscar mayer, a microwave, and some wonder bread, it's time to 86 that sammy for good. Moral of the story, if you're hungry and in the area, there's a Shop'N'Save right next door.",

The restaurant is in a small strip mall so watch for it next to Citizens Bank. It is wonderfully laid out with bar stools and booths! And very heavy on the local flavor events and activities. The food was hot, flavorful, and quickly prepared.  It was all delicious and reasonably priced.  The waitress was efficient and friendly. I also ordered a vanilla milkshake to go and it was wonderfully handmade and highly recommend you buy one!",

The room was bustling but we felt quite comfortable and well taken care of.",

Service is definitely above and beyond: attentive, quick and efficient. Food: average. Over-easy is the only way they know how to cook fried eggs. It's not a huge issue as I ordered them over-medium. My friend also ordered over-med/hard and received eggs over-easy. Turkey sausage was decent. Best part of the meal was the fresh fruit.",

I wanted a messy sandwich. My wife ordered a mushroom Swiss cheese burger and it was excellent. We also had zucchini fries which were delicious. The staff was extremely friendly and very attentive. I could have returned my sandwich but I was hungry. Additionally, the bologna sandwich only had three pieces of meat. The sandwich is served on thick Italian bread that is toasted and I could barely taste the bologna. I really wanted to give a 3 and 1/2 star rating but that isn't possible. I would recommend this Kelly O's if you are looking for typical diner food.",

    "text": "Visited Jan 1st at 12:30 pm and place was packed. Seat yourself and drink order was taken within 3 minutes, but then drinks were slow to arrive due to hand-off to another server. I got coffee and orange juice and ordered the small 1 egg meal with sausage, shredded potatoes with onion and pepper. I thought the menu said 75 cents for them, but it's 75 cents EACH. As others have reported, the shredded potatoes even with onions and peppers didn't have very much seasoning, so I'll be trying the home fries next time. Coffee was mediocre at best and orange juice was very fresh, of course, because it's squeezed on site in a large machine, but it was very light and not like what I'm accustomed to.  Husband got the hot turkey sandwich with fries and they asked if he wanted gravy on both the sandwich and the fries and it was delicious like that. When the gravy on top cooled, the gravy underneath the sandwich was still piping hot. He gobbled the entire thing right down and said he'd definitely order that dish again.  I got 1 single french toast and it was very good but I wouldn't go out of my way to order it again. We then shared the Zucchini fries with ranch on the side (another 50 cents extra) and they were also delicious!! We definitely recommend the hot turkey sandwich and the zucchini fries.  While I'd say the food was mixed with some of the dishes were downright delicious and some were pretty mediocre, I think it's just a matter of finding the right dishes for you and your tastes. Once you've got it down, I think this place could definitely become a regular stop.   Service was slow and kind of sloppy throughout, but they had other duties like filling all sugar, salt, etc on tables so I give them a bit of a break. I would recommend Kelly O's if you're not worried about time.  Decor/House: 3.5 Service: 2.5 Food: 4.0",
