    "text": "New hipster Mediterranean vegan place in lawrenceville.  I had heard some rave reviews from my veggie friends but I just wasn't wowwed.  I had been excited to try some of their lunch entrees but beware- they only serve brunch on the weekends which includes the mezzes, flatbread, salads and some tofu scrambles. So I was unable to try a regular lunch entree which I find weird.  Bustling clean restaurant with many small tables and a larger communal one in the back. We had the kofta tofu scramble which was good and only slightly spicy with generous spinach. We also had the avocado salad which was full of lemony goodness but not a revelation. The highlight was the onion flatbread (which has been jacked up in price from $4 to $6), the onion was like onion jam and very savory.  Service was fast friendly and excellent.  It was $40 or so with tip which I find too pricey for a small flatbread, salad and scramble. Portions were generous tho.",

The breakfast scrambles are very tasty, the greens cooked in garlic and shiitake are a great addition (which you can also get in one of their nice flatbread options), and the potatoes are just on point! Their falafel is amazing whether you prefer the salad or the wrap. The cabbage slaw with lemon gives such a perfect fresh, bright, acidic touch to the tender but crispy and flavorful falafal. I recommend their harissa sauce on everything, it's so good! The coffee has always been yummy, but I'm an even bigger fan of the \"Chic Roja\" rooibos latte! They usually have some flavor of Kombucha on tap and the 3 or 4 times Ive had it ive really enjoyed it. Lastly, their chocolates are awesome little bites to grab on your way out.  The place has always been clean, and the staff has always been friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. My only critiques at all would be the sign outside can be easy to miss driving through, and the smaller size of the place which tends to get backed up quickly, but for food that good it's understandable.  I highly recommend B52!",

We did have to wait a short time in line, but we didn't care, which is unusual for us. We were just excited to be there, and the vibe in the place is very good! We wanted to order most things on the menu, but settled on lattes and wraps. She the tofu scramble, and I got a Seitan \"steak\" like wrap.  We enjoyed and shared both, and only finished half of each.  The tofu scramble had a hint of spicy flavor, and everything blended together well, I didn't want to give it back to her, even though my wrap was like a \"steak um\". Very enjoyable. Loved the whole vibe of the place, its tight in there which we also don't usually like, but in here it didn't matter.  Lots of fun, and I am still full hours later as I write this review! We will be BACK! We have already told others about this GEM! VEGAN NATION!",

They have just the right size menu for a little city spot that focuses on their beverages and to-go goods.

Had a cappuccino and tried the tofu scramble + almond butter toast + cashew cheese toast. Everything was amazing. You can tell these guys work really hard to put out great products made from scratch.

My friend and I both agreed that it was some of the best baba ghanoush we've ever had. Smoked eggplant is genius.   The kombucha i tried and almond milk I had in my coffee were also great and I learned they actually make both of those in-house! We also tried some of their chocolate and I can't even handle how great it was on top of the rest of our meal.  This is already one of my favorite places.

Huge portion too, although the pita chips were too thick to use as chips, and too hard to break into smaller pieces.   Potato-carrot-onion latkes was my favorite. Its like the next level hash brown with lots more ingredients and texture, all fried up.   Avocado toast with black seasame was so simple yet so delicious. Chock full of the green mushy stuff yay!  Vegan brownie that tasted... very vegan. As in it was OK but the oil taste was apparent... possibly use more coffee or chocolate in their recipe?  Sampled their two kombucha of the day, where the the sour vinegar taste was very mild, well masked by the fruity accents.   The overall vibe was very hipster, and service was attentive and welcoming.

    "text": "I love Middle Eastern cuisine, but I usually think of it as being somewhat meat-centric. B52 Cafe is a unique, 100% vegan restaurant serving Middle Eastern classics like falafel, kibbeh, and moussaka.   The menu is set up so you are free to order family-style mezze (small plates) or have a more traditionally structured meal with a starter and entree. Everything is perfect for sharing!   The flatbread ($7) with tomato sauce, cashew cheese, and kalamata olives was seriously amazing. I was kind of wary of the cashew \"cheese,\" but it basically looks and tastes like a thick, creamy ricotta. You have to try this!  I had the fattoush (chopped salad with romaine, cucumber, olives, tomato, and mint; $7) and hummus with pita ($6). This combination was a perfect light dinner! Hummus is usually vegan anyway, so I shouldn't have been surprised that this version was delicious, served with fluffy, warm pita bread. I also tried a bite of the seitan kabob--very flavorful but not for the faint of heart! Make sure you like seitan (wheat gluten) or order the tofu option instead!  I'm not a huge fan of kombucha, but the kombucha they have on tap here almost converted me! The waitress was kind enough to let us sample the pomegranate lime and lemon turmeric flavors.   Despite the lack of dairy and eggs, the desserts were delicious too! The frosting on the carrot cake was completely addicting. They also offer baklava and an assortment of dark chocolate truffles.  The atmosphere here is really relaxed and casual. I was seated at the communal table in the back. And the barstools are actually comfortable, which is hard to come by!  This is definitely a vegan restaurant you can bring your meat-loving friends to! If I lived in the area I would come back again and again!",

Hey, it's not a black napkin but still caring and impressive.  Today the table wabbled and when I brought it to the waitresses attention she gave me some lame excuse about not having matchbooks.  My friend suggested changing our table and the waitress was happy not to have to do anything on her part.   Finally, we both bought containers of the baba to take home because it's the best....well I'm here to say that the flavor is greatly lacking in what they sell in the take out.  So keep this in mind...order a fresh order to take home ($7.50) and if you get the same waitress we had... hold your ground when she gives you some rumdum excuse to try to get you to adjust your order.",

I love that they make so much of their food from scratch, it really shows in the quality and taste. My favorite is their cashew cheese! It is so nice to have a vegan/vegetarian restaurant use homemade cashew cheese and almond milk instead of soy products. If you're not a fan of soy like myself this place is the perfect alternative. Plus it just tastes so much better.  The orange cinnamon vanilla latte is amazing! The homemade almond milk is a nice touch, it's super creamy and delicious! The deserts are great too!  To top it off the food at B52 is so healthy. Not only does it taste good it's good for you. You won't feel guilty eating here!",

The space is cute, and small. I appreciate the small barriers which gave some privacy and sound restriction. The fried cauliflower was delicious,  as were the almond milk lattes.  We ordered the two versions of the tofu scramble. YUM. I couldn't help eyeing up the pancakes from a nearby table. Our waitress was attentive and lovely.  I appreciated how how frequently she refilled water, expressed when bringing the check that she could split it however we liked, and when I asked for a to-go cup for my dipping sauce she brought me a full fresh new cup. They appear to post frequently on their FB page and am looking forward to trying out their dinner menu.",

The space does not have a lot of tables and is very small so we had to wait about 40min to get a table, but once we did it was well worth it. I ordered the Kofta tofu scrambler with added shiitake mushrooms and potatoes on the side. I was very impressed with the taste and the quality. I am not vegan so I wasn't sure what to expect but since my father is a vegetarian I decided to try something new. The spicy sauce they serve with it is delicious. I also had the pomegranate kombucha drink which was also fresh and tasty. I would definitely come back here for Sunday brunch on my own again.",

I walked a few blocks down to B52 and ended up grabbing a seat at the bar and enjoying a nice lunch, too.   I am not vegan but I am trying to incorporate more vegan/veg meals into my lifestyle. So I am excited for this place because they have a lot of new things for me to try and at a reasonable price! From the moment I walked in everyone was super friendly. Though about three people were tending to me, so I'm not exactly sure who I was tipping! But they were all fantastic.   Almost all of the tables were taken on a Saturday at Noon. I opted for a spot at the counter area. I ordered the falafel wrap and it was so good. The homemade wrap itself was slightly dry but the falafel inside was cooked to perfection. The Mediterranean slaw was so good... my first time ever having pickled beets but they were good, too. I opted for a side of fries (total $11) and I'm glad I did because, heaven.   I normally only like flavored coffee drinks, unless the coffee itself is really good. I got the vanilla latte ($5.25) and wow.... spectacular. Just the right amount of flavor and you can tell the coffee was high quality.   Excited to go back and try more!",

    "text": "Walked in on a Sunday around 2pm for brunch. There were approx. 4 parties ahead of us, but we decided to wait the estimated 25 minutes. The hostess was extremely friendly and thanked some parties for continuing to wait.   About 35 minutes later, we were seated at a table for two. My husband enjoyed the lemon kombucha drink and our waitress even gave us a taste of the cherry vanilla. They were both refreshing, but I enjoyed the lemon better.   Oh, avocado toast. Where have you been all my life? Lemony, tahini-flavored, and just enough texture from the black sesame scattered top, we ordered another round (which they forgot to serve, but voluntarily took off our bill as a result). I just could not help myself. Next the lentil soup came out, orangey-red in color, which had hints of curry and small chunks of lemon zest at the bottom. The lemon was such an unexpected touch and a surprising treat, as I neared the end of my bowl. I particularly enjoyed the parsley garnish, which contrasted well with the rest of the soup's flavors.   Out came our onion flatbreads. Now all of you 'onion-heads' like myself have something to look forward to. Flavorful and cut into four, I very much enjoyed every bite. I thought maybe a base spread would have paired well on this flatbread, but I scarfed it down nonetheless. My husband also ordered the potato cakes, which were flattened and crisp. He RAVED about the tahini dipping sauce (which I might have to learn how to make, if I know what's good for me). I personally enjoyed it, but thought some fresh garlic/some other fresh spice would have enhanced its flavors a bit more.   Service was good and and all wait staff were friendly, although we had two servers for most of the experience, due to high crowd numbers. If you end up coming for brunch, the lot just past the cafe is free on Sundays.  I am so looking forward to returning- and hopefully next time will save room for their tempting desserts!",

    "text": "While the food is some of the best vegan cuisine in all of Pittsburgh, the service leaves more to be desired.   My first experience at your establishment was on a Saturday around noon last week. A woman with large ear gauges was our server. She had trouble hearing me and rather than saying \"I'm sorry, I am having trouble hearing you,\" she commented \"you are so quiet\". As an autistic man, this really hurt my feelings - I have trouble with volume control. The server did not smile, was not personable towards our table, did not deliver our food in a timely manner, did not deliver the check in a timely manner, did not refill our waters in a timely manner, and left a bad taste in my mouth overall.   I excused this unfortunate experience, and figured you were busy, the server was having an off day, and I decided to give B52 a second chance at a less busy time during the week.  I decided to give it another chance around 2:30 PM today, a Tuesday. The restaurant was absolutely empty when I arrived. By the time I left, there were only two other groups.  As someone who has worked in the restaurant industry, been a customer service manager, as well as a supervisor in a retail setting, I know the proper way of wording things, and proper customer service etiquette. I am afraid the same can not be said for your staff. I was dining alone. I walked in to find five or six  employees standing at the entrance. Not one greeted me. I finally managed to make eye contact with a young blonde woman. I ask \"do I seat myself?\" She said \"yes\" and suggested I sit at the bar as I am dining alone on this particular day. The server was a man this time as well as a barista (he had some name starting with a \"K\", although I only know this because I saw it on my receipt, not because he had the decency to introduce himself).  I placed my order - blueberry pancakes, tofu scramble, and a side of latkes. The server's face shows an expression of judgment as he remarks \"that is a lot of food...\". He goes in to great detail saying there are \"two large pancakes, and the tofu scramble already comes with latkes\". Yes, I was aware of that, and I wanted more latkes - i reserve every right to order as much food for myself as I please at a dinging establishment, don't I? Maybe you would consider offering the option of just ordering just one pancake as opposed to two.  Or maybe train your servers not to shame me for my order.  The male waiter brought my food, was not personable, did not tell me to enjoy my meal, did not check on me to make sure everything was to my liking (i.e. he did not offer the \"how is everything?\" that is to be expected when dining out), did not refill my water, and then he disappeared for a half hour. The female gauged ear server mentioned earlier was also present. She looked miserable, but she eventually refilled my empty glass after 15 minutes. I thanked her and she avoided eye contact and said nothing. She later refilled my glass again, I thanked her again, and she did not respond. She also did not ask if my food was to my liking. I do not know if she is holding a grudge for my mediocre tip I had left her last time (for her less than mediocre service), but it seemed like she had some personal problem with me - I witnessed her serving her tables and being friendly and pleasant with them. Don't I deserve the same treatment? I feel as though people don't take me seriously because I am young, or something else - I am unsure, but nobody in your establishment has ever made me feel welcome except your female hostess with short hair I encountered on my first visit.   A manager (I assume) was siting next to me and asked if it took that long for me to get my check. I said \"yes\" and he asked if they did not serve me fast enough or if I expected to get out of there faster - I said it was fine because I was uncomfortable criticizing someone who was still within earshot of me (your male barista-server). I love your food, please consider retraining your staff on how to properly interact with guests. This was a very upsetting experience for me.",

    "text": "Went here this evening for an early dinner with a vegan friend who was in from out of town. The food was good but I was surprised at how the server treated our menu selection. She did ask if we had other allergies and I mentioned that I'm gluten free. She said they have an awesome gluten free flat bread that can accompany the mezzo plates (tapas style middle eastern dips- we had the baba, labneh, and fried tomatoes (which didn't seem fried, they were more like stewed tomatoes on a plate with extremely spicy wasabi)   I asked if I could also get a piece of toast from their menu but on the gluten free bread. The waitress said \"no we don't do that because we don't think it tastes good with that portion of the menu\" it wasn't a \"let me see about it\" or anything, just flat no.  I truly cannot imagine why someone else would tell me what they think I would prefer to eat based on their taste palate. It's a local cafe type of restaurant, not anything super upscale where you'd expect it to be a hard set menu. If I'm willing to pay extra to adhere to my allergies, I can't imagine why they wouldn't want to accommodate that.   The bread they did bring out that was gluten free was really good and I imagine it would have been amazing as toast! It seemed like a type of pumpernickel with sesame seeds. I was surprised at how small the portion was (four pieces about one inch by four inches to eat three plates of dip with. She did bring pita for my non-gluten free friend in abundance but I was expecting more than what I got since I was the one who ordered it). I'm so so about whether I'd go back mostly because of the customer service - not because of the food!",

    "text": "I have been looking forward to eating here for quite some time. When I arrived around the noon hour the place was virtually empty. I saw on the chalkboard a menu sign where you can order or asked to be seated. I choose the latter.  A nice, friendly, and helpful waitress gave me a menu and helped me interpret what I wanted to eat. Breakfast ended at 11 so that will be on a future visit. The menu has items on it that can be served all day such as \"mezze\" which is a choice of dip(s) with pita or thick cut toast served with various toppings.  Since this place is entirely vegan I opted for the falafel sandwich and a small plate of mujadara. Sandwiches can be paired as a lunch combo with your choice of soup, salad, or fries for $12.00.  When I was asked for a beverage I was disappointed to learn that they don't offer ice tea but they can take any tea your order and serve it with a cup of ice to cool it. I opted for the half pot of gunpowder green tea. It is served in a pot with a small glass and was ok just as it was.  The mujadara is made with basmati rice, green lentils, onions, and Tahini yogurt sauce. I received that small plate first and it was out of this world delicious! My falafel came with a homemade wrap. It consisted of Mediterranean slaw, chick peas, pickled turnips, preserved lemons, and Tahini sauce. This wrap was so big I had to cut it just to eat it. Loved it but it was a little messy. To me as long as it tastes good I don't care about it being messy.  I got to chat a little with the folks at the next table. One of them ordered the Shiitake mushroom flatbread AKA Manakish. it looked like a 6 cut pizza. He offered me a small slice to try and that too was out of this world good!  I was stuffed with my meal when my waitress went over the dessert menu. They serve various cookies and brownies along with homemade truffles made with various fillings. I decided to hold off for now until a future visit.  Prices here are very reasonable. You definitely can get a nourishing and healthy lunch here. My waitress told me as I was leaving that they do offer brunch on Sat and Suns only since they are open until 3. I will keep that in mind for a future visit.  B52 is a small restaurant located in Upper Lawrenceville. It sits next door to a bank so it isn't hard to miss while driving up that way. I was extremely pleased with my visit and have it on my bucket list to return to try their other offerings. Upon request I was given a take out menu to help me plan a future visit.",

Also, the cucumber yogurt tasted just as good as any other dairy yogurt I've had, if not better knowing that it was cruelty and dairy free.

Although mostly Mediterranean cuisine, the chef uses some creative tweaks to keep the food vegan.   Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu, and passionate about the food. The were no missteps common to a brand new opening, except the restaurant is more wildly popular than they could have thought and by the end of the day they were all out of soup.  Pittsburghers have been looking forward to more vegan and vegetarian food, I'm sure they will embrace this marvelous new cafe.",

Our server greeted us upon entering and sat us immediately. The dining area was very clean. The seating was close to other tables to feel intimate, but not close enough to hear their conversations. The kitchen area is open, so we could see the food being prepared. The restaurant has the vibe of being in a friend's kitchen.   We both ordered almondmilk maple lattes, each had a little leaf artwork on the top layer. We both ordered the avocado toast, which was on thick grainy bread and heavily drizzled with tahini sauce. My friend ordered the shitakke mushrooms on the bed of kale and I had the lentil soup with preserved lemon (special of the day). Everything was the correct temperature. The serving sizes were just enough: you leave feeling satiated, but not with a doggy bag. The pacing is great for catching up with a friend, mid-work day.   I look forward to trying their dessert or brunch next time I visit.   B52 makes simply makes delicious vegan food.",

    "text": "B52 is a beautiful, open, naturally lit space in the heart of upper Lawrenceville that serves delicious middle eastern vegan food and homemade chocolate truffles.  Their falafel sandwich is my favorite in the city!  The portion is very generous for $8, and it comes with pickled turnips (mmm!  so good) and slaw. The flavor packs a zesty, citrusy zing.  It tastes so fresh and healthy and yet is so filling. Get this with the harissa sauce for a little extra flavor and a spicy kick!  The moussaka is also out of this world good -- frankly, more flavorful and delicious than the best meat moussaka I've had in the city. That's quite a feat. Seriously, get this. It comes with deliciously seasoned rice (to which I added some harissa sauce, too) topped with toasted almonds and perfectly cooked green beans and beets, too.  I've also tried the tofu scramble and found the texture to be spot-on but the flavor to be quite bland.  Perhaps I will try the kofta tofu scramble, which sounds more flavorful, next time.  Finally, don't overlook their truffles!  They are sooo tasty.  I love my chocolate fairly dark, and their truffles are a lot less cloyingly sweet than most others I have had.  Some are more inventive than others (my favorite flavors are the creative cardamom espresso, and the relatively more familiar peanut butter).  Just try them!  They are delicious.  I have only ever gotten takeout from here, but the space is beautiful and I look forward to dining in for brunch sometime soon.  The staff has always been nothing short of pleasant and accommodating.  What a pleasant surprise for a meat-lover like myself!",

I started with a cafe Rico latte...flavors of orange and cinnamon with house made almond milk...delicious!  I wanted everything on the menu so it was very difficult to decide...I finally ordered avacado toast and lentil soup. There was a strong lemon theme with preserved lemon on the toast and chunks of fresh lemon in the soup...which I loved...so good! There was lots of avacado on the toast and the bread was the perfect blend of chewy and toasty. The soup was a great lentil soup and so bright with the bits if lemon as I mentioned. It was such a treat to have a meal at B52 and I can't wait to return!",

We originally came here to try the latkes but ended up also getting the thick cut avocado toast, red lentil soup, and the seitan schwarma. The latkes weren't bad but nothing to rave about; however, I highly recommend the the avocado toast. They use a thick cut fluffy white bread and cover it in a hefty portion of avocado; on top they drizzle it in dark sesame and tahini sauce. I'd never had a soup like the red lentil soup but it's now one of my favorites. It's a broth based yellow soup with a good portion of lentils. The hint of lemon and herbs also gives it a great punch of freshness. The seitan schwarma was refreshing. I'm not a vegan or vegetarian by any means but I find seitan to be delicious. I'm a big fan of pickled everything so the pickled raddish(I believe) is wonderful. Their tzatziki sauce was also really flavorful. We've been back here many times and we've never had a bad experience.",

I usually base my food choices on 'is it piping hot' and 'does it have a lot of different awesome sauces that aren't mayonnaise' and the answer here is yes to both. I did have a little wait, even though it was an off-peak time and not gonna lie a lot of the staff has this kind of felinic vibe that pretty much dares you to get them to care but they get the job done, aren't always in your face and kinda warm up to you in the end. I got some sort of pick-three pita dish and I feel there was enough food for two really hungry people or 4 somewhat hungry friends. there was plenty of warm pita in a covered basket and the hummus did not look like a cat just threw up which being realistic can happen some times. I took about 1/2 of it home, went to work a hockey game and then realized I still had some left over so pulled over to write this review in praise. If there is one bad thing it is the carry out containers don't stay closed when you close them or stay open when you open them but they looked biodegradable so I'll give them a pass and bring a rubber band next time.",

The pancakes were good but they were almost too heavy. One pancake is totally enough :). The venue is super clean, inviting and the menu albeit small has plenty of options for vegans and those who want to have a good breakfast that doesn't make them feel bloated and gross for the duration of their afternoon.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I had dinner here for the first time last night, and we loved it!! We started off with the buffalo cauliflower. The sauce definitely wasn't traditional buffalo sauce, but it still tasted great. We thought the amount of food was a little small for $6, but we enjoyed it nonetheless. For our entrees, I got the cashew cheese flatbread with kalamata olives. Absolutely AMAZING. My boyfriend got the seitan schwarma with a side of fried oyster mushrooms. The seitan in the schwarma was a bit tough, but it still tasted great. The mushrooms were great!! Similar to calamari. We ended things with dessert. I had the peanut butter chocolate chip cookie, and he had the carrot cake. We both got hot chocolates. The hot chocolates only came in one size, and were pretty small, but they tasted great.  Service was good- our waitress was great, but she seemed a bit overwhelmed, which led us to believe that they were short staffed. The restaurant's decor is really cute, which is always a plus. Overall, we had a great experience and can't wait to be back!",

This past weekend was my second time eating brunch here and it has all the elements of a vegan spot that I look for aka it is healthy, not too many meat substitutes are used, tons of variety in the menu, they don't overdo it on the salt, lots of veggies and also tons of baked goods offered.   The avocado toast is super delicious-- really crispy yet chewy toast and then lemon tahini sauce on top creates an awesome combo. I have also had the tofu scramble both times I ate here, the portions is large, its adequately seasoned and is a full meal with sauteed kale and delicious latkes on the side. The pancakes are also massive and delicious so I have heard. As far as the beverages go they have that covered as well. When you order hot tea here they bring you a whole pot to yourself which I love. They also offer kombucha on draft, have nitro coffee which is dope, and tons of other specialty drinks.   Service here has been really friendly and fast both times. The ambiance is pleasant and not too crunchy or hip, but more like a bright coffee shop/bakery inside. After I eat here I leave feeling satisfied, caffeinated, not overly stuffed and ready to take on my day in the Burgh. Excited to brunch here again when I visit next.",

    "text": "For the record, I am not vegan.  I enjoy eating almost all kinds of food.  I came here with my family, some of whom are vegetarians, though not vegan.  The food was simply delicious.  A quick run-down.  We started with a shared 6 Mezze sampler.  1. The hummous was good.  I would not say amazing or particularly different, but very good.  Certainly better than the container hummous you get in the grocery store.  I make my own hummous and not trying to be immodest, but this was as good as mine.  2.  The Baba Ghanoush is really excellent.  It is much better than any that I have made.  It is smoky and has a perfect balance of eggplant and I assume garlic and tahini and lemon.  3.  We had a tomato and kale (?) dip that was delicious with Pita.  4.  The Falafel were really superb--lighter and more aromatic than most I have had--and I have eaten a lot of falafel in my life.  5.  The Labneh was a real surprise.  As this is a vegan restaurant, it was not dairy (it is usually like thick spiced greek yogurt/ cheese)--but rather seemed like it was made of a blended cashew butter.    6.  The roasted cauliflower was good--just not super distinctive.  I did not sample everyone's meal, but I did try mine, and my wife's.  A.  My Seitan Shawarma Sandwich/Wrap was absolutely superb.  It was so delicious.  It was actually more delicious and juicy than any kind of Shawarma using Gyro meat I have ever had.    B.  My wife had the Cashew \"Cheese\" sandwich/wrap.  It was surprisingly good - from a marketing perspective it doesn't sound great but the overall effect with the lettuce and spices is delightful.  I think that the Cashew Cheese was pretty similar to the Labneh.    If you like Mediterranean food you will love this place.  If you are Vegan, you will love the fact that B-52 manages to satisfy both those who are looking for dishes that \"fake\" meat dishes, and dishes that celebrate meat free dairy free ingredients in their own right.  Go there, enjoy.",

I don't mind eating vegetarian options from time to time though, and I knew what I was getting into when we came here, so I figured I'd be all right. We had heard great things about B52 as a vegan spot.  I ended up ordering the zaatar manakish flatbread, which sounded right up my alley. Having never had zaatar before, I can't really tell you if it was supposed to taste that way or if mine was just horrible, but I barely forced myself to finish it. My friend who was with me also confirmed it was no good. The pancakes she had ordered were good though. Perhaps zaatar flatbread isn't for me, perhaps mine was prepared poorly, I'm not sure, but it ranks very high on my most hated food items I've ordered.  Service was good, and several other things on the menu at least sound promising, which has kept the rating up at 3-stars despite how thoroughly unenjoyable my food was.",

We did have to wait for a bit (~15 min) even though it was past 2 on on Sunday. We ordered some lattes (cafe Rico and lavender-vanilla), which were both super tasty--you had the option of either almond or coconut milk. We also tried the za'atar flatbread and the tofu scramble, which were both made with so much good flavor and had great portion sizes. We ate literally ever piece off of the plates. The best part was the free sauces, which we chose the harissa and zhoug--both slightly spicy but so tasty. Didn't try the tahini, but I'm sure that one is really good as well! The atmosphere was perfect for a laidback meal and the service was efficient and friendly. I'll definitely be coming back to try more items and I highly recommend everybody to come this place out!",

    "text": "A good vegan lunch! My boyfriend and I came here at 2pm on a Saturday for a late lunch. We had the almond butter toast topped with raspberry preserves, the kofta tofu scramble with complimentary tahini sauce, the falafel wrap, a side of latkes (shredded potatoes, carrots, and onion), and a side of fries. This was more than enough food for two people.   Almond butter toast was very good (no complaints). Kofta tofu scramble didn't meet my expectations in terms of taste, but the sauce it came with (along with the tahini I added) saved it from being just mediocre. Definitely could've used more sauce though. My boyfriend did not like the falafel wrap and said there wasn't enough falafel, but I thought it was pretty good. The latkes were oily, but we really enjoyed them. The fries came in a large portion, which is always a good thing.   Loved the tahini sauce. It tasted great on everything we got!

They had a lot of yummy desserts and homemade chocolates that were hard to pass up. Maybe next time.  They place is kind of rustic urban mix.  I almost missed the place cause i mainly saw the B and not the small 52 on the door.  If the place is marked anywhere other than the door it didn't stand  out to me.  Definitely worth coming to.   It's not a good place to work or meet for business,cause the music was way too loud for that. Also the gals that work there seemed really nice when i walked in but then no one offered to take my order and when I asked if I could they made me feel like I was doing something wrong. Idk, it was silverware folding time of the day, maybe I was interrupting side work. Still come here. It was great.",

We were sat right away and took a look at the menu.  The waiter explained a bit about the menu, and we ordered maple nitro cold brew coffees, the cauliflower mezze appetizer, falafel sandwich with soup, and kofta tofu wrap with french fries.  The French fries were awesome, easily the best I've had in years.  The kofta was the worst tasting thing I've had in recently memory (maybe it's an acquired taste?). A couple bites and that was all either of could stomach so we shared my falafel sandwich (which is actually a wrap.) The lentil soup was good, I liked the occasional taste of lemon.  The falafel wrap was also good.  The cauliflower tasted great (but salty) especially the dip that came with it.  The cold brew coffees were good but next time I will omit the maple.   I was wavering between 3 or 4 stars thinking that perhaps my expectations were artificially high, but then I realized that after a while I started to feel self-conscious.",

They have a specials board and the baked goods and coffee bar set up at first glance. The waitress talked about a few things on the menu as it was a first time trip there. Me and my girlfriend ordered a bit of everything and shared it. I'm happy we did because the portions are HUGE! The tofu scramble is amazing along with the spicy meatless sausage, the kale was packed with flavor and all had a great amount of spicy to it. The pancakes where next level and I'm not even a pancake person. The blueberrys really added a extra \"bam spice it up a notch\" the potato's where just as excellent as everything else with a wonderful crisp. But to be honest my favorite part of the whole meal was the chocolate chip cookies and the spicy chocolate with a glass of almond milk. I ordered another cookie because I could not get over how soft and flavorful they where. I'm honestly hooked. I can't wait till next time I'm in this part of town so I can stop by again because this time I'm also gonna get some cookies to go! This is a must try for someone looking for something different or just a healthy full hearted vegan breakfast!",

It was my first visit and needless to say, I think I'm already obsessed. Definitely one of the best vegan restaurants I've been to in Pittsburgh.  I stopped in during the lunch rush. With the small space and limited seating, we would have had a bit of wait, but luckily, there were open spots at the bar. Service was fantastic from start to finish. We were promptly greeted by our waitress who was friendly and helpful throughout the meal - amazing all around!  The menu takes middle eastern cuisine and gives it a unique flare. Some items and combos may sound a bit odd, but they surprisingly work. I ordered the koftka tofu scramble which came with wilted kale, eggs, and a seitan/tofu mix. Highly recommend! Not only was it delicious but the portion was huge so you're sure to be satisfied afterwards. The seitan/tofu had the consistency of ground beef and was seasoned very well but not too overpowering. To satisfy my sweet tooth, I had the almond cashew yogurt which was essentially a yogurt parfait. Simple but still delicious.  Although vegan food has a bad reputation, B52 definitely raises the bar. This is a great lunch or dinner option for vegans and even non-vegans. If I could come here for every meal, I would be the happiest veghead on the planet.",

    "text": "B52 recently opened in Pittsburgh and as a vegetarian, I had lots of friends sending me articles about the new vegan place opening in Lawrenceville. I couldn't be happier that my friends shared the news with me. B52 is a lovely, sun-filled cafe on Butler street (at the corner of Butler and 52nd... hence B52, I would presume). They have a coffee bar and lots of pastries and tables for sitting and ordering food. Their website touts the food as an American and Middle Eastern fusion, and it is quite delightful. As a vegetarian, I often am disappointed with vegan places because I still do want the eggs, cheese, dairy, etc. and miss them in vegan cuisine. However, the food at B52 is great and I didn't even notice the lack of dairy and eggs! The first time I went, I had the Kofta Tofu Scramble, which was good. Both times I went, I had a wonderful drink called the Love Potion #8, which is essentially a raspberry mocha (decadent and wonderful!). The second time, I got the avocado toast (not truly toast, as the bread is soft and untoasted, but I preferred it that way), which was fantastic, and a side of latkes, which were good but not as good as others I've had. Overall, it was a pleasant environment with nice good, wonderful coffee drinks, and relatively good service (a little slower than it should have been given the number of patrons the times I was there). The prices are a little on the high side for the amount of food you're getting, but are certainly reasonable.",

Vegan baked goods can tend to be dry, but they seem to clearly understand maintaining moisture content in their baked goods. It's a beautifully redone building with a tasteful mixture or traditional tin ceilings and woodwork with modern lighting and finishes. The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I would recommend this place for vegans and their carnivorous friends ;-)",

I hear it can get busy, but the atmosphere is also welcoming to the lone bruncher or coffee sipper. I ordered the tofu scramble and toast with almond butter and raspberry jam. The food was fresh and very flavorful. Good portion sizes. Will be making this a regular brunch spot. Can't wait to try the lunch food (and hopefully dinner soon)!",

Neither of us are vegan/veg but we wanted something lighter with this crazy hot weather and it looked like they would have a lot of different options. The waitress was really attentive and nice and was happy to help my friend with new dietary restrictions customize something that she could eat. I had the sauteed shiitakes and spinach along with the lentil soup of the day. The soup was phenomenal- high in flavor (not in saltiness) and really filling. My friend had the avocado salad which was a generous portion and with an amazing lemony dressing. The baba ganoush was fantastic- creamy and smoky (but not overly so). Everything was very high in flavor and visually appealing too. I will definitely be back to try all of the other things that looked great (cashew cheese flatbread, avocado toast, falafel, and many others). Also looks like a great take-out spot with a cafe window and tasty looking treats to go (hummus, baba, pickled vegetables, all sorts of desserts). Definitely great for vegans and non-vegans alike!",

I arrived from out of town, flustered because I don't know the area, traffic was bad and parking difficult (you can parallel park on the street on Sundays, but its tight and just one lane in each direction so you piss off the people behind you). The cafe is adorable, clean and bright. There was a queue for tables but as I was dining on my own, I was seated at the gorgeous marble counter immediately.   They were really busy and I was probably not their ideal guest: party of one, and desperate to get online on my laptop (generally frowned upon in restaurants, especially trendy busy ones) for reasons I won't go into. Suffice it to say I was desperate enough to risk the eyerolls of busy staff..... but at B52 I didn't have to. Everyone was polite and efficient and helpful to a fault. I LOVED the food, it absolutely hit the spot. And I think I had three coffee refills before heading out.   I would definitely brave the traffic and parking to come again!",

This is the place to take vegans and meat eaters alike. I have tried so many different foods and have always been happy.  For example, I don't even normally like pancakes, but after trying my friend's, I considered ordering pancakes. I've had cauliflower, hummus, flatbreads, chocolates, a cinnamon roll, \"yogurt\" parfait, and  have some of the best babaganoush I have ever had in my life. It is smoky, rich, and delicious.  All of the lattes and coffee drinks I've tried have been interesting and complex, but maybe a tiny bit too sweet for my taste.  I highly recommend B52 if you like fresh and flavorful food and great service.",

I went for the full service and the server was very friendly and knowledgeable. The only thing i would change is that for the latkas, typically they are served with apple sauce and they don't have it so i had ketchup instead. I'll definitely be back soon though to try the kombucha and tofu scramble that I've heard is incredible!",

We ordered avocado toast, a cashew cheese flatbread and blueberry sourdough buckwheat pancakes.   Our waitress was super attentive and the food came out so quickly. The avocado toast was perfect: crunchy toast, creamy avocado and lemony tahini sauce. We loved how fresh it tasted!   The cashew cheese flatbread was also delicious. The tomato sauce was very fresh and the olives gave a great salty bite. The cashew cheese was tangy and creamy. The flatbread was everything!  We ended our meal with the pancakes. They were sweet and delicious. A little difficult to cut into because of the buckwheat but still amazing. They were light and airy.   On our way out, I bought a cookie to go while my friend bought a cinnamon roll. Both were delicious! B52 is a great place!!",

Only one of us was vegetarian, but all of us enjoyed the spectacular meal we had that night.  We started our meal with the Taste 6 mezze, which included hummus, fried cauliflower (YUM!), baba ghanouj, falafel (also YUM!), labneh, and tomatoes. The mezze also came with warm, pita bread.  Our small plates included fries with za'atar (MUST HAVE) and buffalo cauliflower (tasted better than it sounds). For my entree, I split the falafel sandwich with my wife. The sandwich was plenty for us to share.  Next time I'll save room for dessert. The bakalava looked fantastic.  Very attentive service. Food came out quickly. Would go back and our next visit to Pittsburgh.",

For our appetizer, we choose a trio of dips(hummus, cashew cheese dip and eggplant dip). While we loved them all, our favorite was definitely the eggplant dip, which had a delicious smokey flavor. The dips came with a side of the best and freshest pita bread we have ever had! As our main meals, she got the cashew cheese flatbread and I got the kofta. Both were sooo fresh and full of flavor! We ended our meals with a cinnamon bun (because we couldn't help ourselves), and oh my goodness it tasted like paradise on earth. Wow, I really cannot say enough about how lovely B52 is.

I plan on trying a lot more dishes and their Sunday brunch specials when I get a chance.  Everything is flavored just right, not too much or too little and nothing is over or under salted which is the case at so many restaurants even the high-end ones.  I don't know about others but the entrees leave me feeling full for at least 6-7 hours.  Bottom line, even if you are not vegan, you will find more than one thing to enjoy here.",

We also had the latkes which were good but not great.  I also ordered a 3 mezze sampler.  The hummus was fresh but the babaganoush was lacking for sure (I barely had more than a few bites).  We also had the falafel sandwich (which was pretty good but again not amazing, I don't think they make their pita fresh) and the cashew cheese sandwich.  The cashew cheese was pretty gross but that's not their fault as it's never very good (may taste ok going down but your stomach will be bloated and hurting for hours after).  If you are craving interesting vegan food in Pittsburgh, I would recommend going to Apteka and skipping this place.",

The 32 seat cafe includes a full service coffee and espresso bar, as well as, small bakery and take out section. While waiting for a table, my mouth watered over the fresh baked goods including vegan cinnamon rolls, brownies, truffles, cookies, and more!  The menu has a Mediterranean theme, but it also includes some general vegan staples such as tofu scramble and buckwheat pancakes. The best part about the menu is that everything is made in house and prepared fresh! The kofta tofu scramble is a MUST try for brunch!  Don't hesitate to head to B52 for your next vegan meal!

We went for a weekday breakfast, so those were the only foods we tried. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive, and helped us choose amongst the multiple tempting choices on the menu. I got the spicy kofta tofu scramble, which was truly amazing. I've had a lot of scrambles, but this one was especially good. We tried the cashew cheese mannish (flatbread) too, and that was great. And don't miss the baked goods - the brownie was fair, but the chocolate chip cookies were divine, and vegan cinnamon rolls? I can be pretty picky about those, but these were perfect. So glad to have found this place!!",

I ordered a latte that came with almond milk (it's vegan after all) but the after taste was so bad my stomach turned every time I took a sip. I've never had an almond milk latte before so I have no idea if this is normal tasting. My husband loved his straight up black coffee, so I think if you don't get fancy it's all good.  I had toast with cashew butter and raspberry jam which was delicious, and potato / carrot latkes. They were fine.  Husband had a tofu seitan scramble with kale, which was also basic and fine. We were on vacation so had no access to a kitchen--it would have been a very easy thing to make quickly at home too.   The experience was capped off by the couple next to us discussing in horror that we get our coconut products from slave monkeys that are beaten and abused if they do not harvest enough coconuts.",

    "text": "As it seems that the trend for more vegetarian and vegan cafes seems to be picking up, B52 is a cute little addition to Lawrenceville.  I met friends for brunch, and luckily we went early (10am) because by 11:00 the seating was all filled up.  After a morning run, I chose the hearty kofta-tofu scramble, and was not disappointed. I am not vegan, nor a vegetarian, but the flavors of this dish were just as good as many eggs and sausage dishes I've tried.  The most noticeable thing about the dish was the size...it was easily a double portion, and I took home the other half...which made my Monday morning quite nice ;)  My friends ordered the granola parfait and the pancake, and my meal was definitely the biggest portion. The granola parfait was noticeably small, but went great when paired with another food item.  Unfortunately, the sweet side of my meal wasn't quite as good as the savory.  My friend and I both ordered cinnamon rolls, which looked amazing presented in the glass serving dish on the counter.  Our waitress brought them to us warm, and with the icing melted on top we were really excited for a brunch splurge.  So it was a little disappointing when all I could think about was how I needed a glass of milk to wash it down...or better yet, dunk it!  The pastry was so dry, and I kept thinking...maybe it just needs...some eggs?  Milk?  Not sure, but it just wasn't what I was hoping it would be.  The cinnamon swirl was flavorful and would have been delicious if I was eating a scone...but a cinnamon roll is supposed to be soft, gew-y and doughy...and this one was not.  So my take-home message is this....if you like the hipster vibe of Lawrenceville, B52 Cafe will feel right at home.  Get the scramble, skip the cinnamon roll.",

I had to stand up and go after some server and ask for menu, water, etc. Then he said \"sorry\".  After that we tried the cashew cheese appetizer, my husband and I both liked it. For main course, I had the onion flat bread and he had the falafel sandwich. The onion flatbread was too sweet ( I am not sure if they added sugar or not). I was expecting more of a savory taste, also because on the menu it indicated that it has sumac (one of my favorite spices) which has a savory/sour taste. I did not like the onion flatbread. My husband said the falafel sandwich was not very well balanced: some parts had too little veggies to balance out the falafel.   I would have liked to return to try out other items on the menu, but with their pathetic service, I doubt it.",

I got a side of fresh cut fries because DUH that I opted to add the wonderful spice blend of za'atar (do it and you'll thank me).

    "text": "My boyfriend had been telling me he wanted to take me here, and I had heard rave reviews from friends, so we went yesterday (a Sunday) for a nice little date. As I'm sure you know, Sundays are busy at establishments that offer brunch, so there was a wait, but it wasn't terrible. Kudos to the staff, because even though they were slammed, people who were coming in just a half hour til close we're still welcomed and given time to consider the menu options.  We started with Lavender Vanilla Lattes, which were pretty much perfect: Not too sweet, but not bland. If anything, I'd have liked to have tasted the lavender more. My guy was a little bummed that the Brunch Menu didn't include any sandwiches (which he enjoys a lot off of the weekday menu) but he opted for thick cut Avocado Toast, which we both LOVED.  I got the Tofu Scramble. The tofu was the perfect, fluffy consistency and could pass for eggs. The side of Kale and Shitakes was fabulous, and as someone who is leery of kale (because it is SO easy to cook badly!) I was impressed. The accompanying latkes were a bit lackluster, but maybe that's my Jewish background making me extremely critical of the dish.  I topped everything with a hearty portion of Zhoug, which I personally believe could save most food. Caution: If you're not a Spice Fan, steer clear of the Zhoug! The Cashew Cheese was a let-down, but mostly because of personal preference. It had a bit too much tang, and I'm normally fine with that, but I prefer a more nutty/ umami cashew cheese.  I honestly would recommend this place though, gripes aside, because of the efficient service and cozy atmosphere. Give it a try, even if you're not Vegan!",

Neither of us are vegetarians, either! The highlights:  - The seitan kabobs were wild! I'm usually a little reluctant to order seitan because it can be soooo dry, but these are honkin' chunks are so thoroughly marinated all the way through and m o i s t. I've never had seitan like this before! I didn't even know it could come in such big honks! Honestly amazing. You can build a perfect seitany bite with the hummus, 'yogurt' dip, and brown rice it comes with. - The fried oyster mushrooms (as an appetizer) were delicious! They reminded me of fried oysters. (It never occurred to me that this is why the mushrooms are named what they are.)  We also did the Mezze 3 with hummus, the baba ghanoush, and the falafel. All quality. My friend got their house brewed kombucha and I wish it was a little bubblier, but I can't get my own kombucha to hold carbonation to save anyone's life so I commiserate.",

    "text": "I may be a carnivore by all definitions but I can definitely get down with the occasional vegan cuisine, and last night that's just what I did.  I had no idea this place was so cozy and cute inside! I can imagine there being a wait for a table at peak times since it's on the smaller side, but I appreciated the layout and the variety of tables that can accommodate anything from a group outing to a quiet date night.  To start, we ordered 3 selections from the Mezze menu:  falafel, fried cauliflower, and hummus.  The falafel were crispy on the outside, but soft, moist, and flavorful inside.  The cauliflower was perfectly cooked and packed much more flavor than I was expecting.  Last, but certainly not least, the hummus.  The texture was smooth and the flavor was on point.  I loved that it was all served with warm pita, too!  Gluten free bread is also an option for a small upcharge.  I probably could've gotten away with throwing in the napkin after the appetizer round, but I ordered the avocado salad with tofu for my main.  I love tofu and their preparation paired well with this salad.  The tofu was cut in thin strips, making it easy to manage with the soft avocado, radishes, and mixed greens.  The salad was tossed in what I believe was preserved lemon (just going off the menu here), and I think next time I'd ask for that on the side just so I can take my leftovers home!  I've learned that a wet salad makes for sad, soggy leftovers.  I'm extremely intrigued by B52's brunch offerings, so I know I'll be back in due time.  It's going to require some extreme strategy on my part, since I don't see myself being able to decide between a tofu scramble, avocado toast, AND latkes!  One of everything, please and thank you!",

I had the peanut butter and raspberry preserves on toast with a cinnamon rose latte. Shut the front door. I know it doesn't sound amazing but each element was perfect. The latte wasn't too sweet which happens more often than not. The peanut butter tasted homemade and the preserves were delightful, like fresh picked fruit. I can't wait to try the falafel salad. That was my second choice.  Someone happened to order it seated next to us . I got a peak and it looked wonderful, too. Cool atmosphere and service was fast and pleasant.",

On their board outside it says that B-52 is a vegan food and Espresso Bar. So one would assume that if you go inside and order a mocha you would walk away with said mocha.  Not the case on this lovely Saturday afternoon. I went in and ordered my usual blood orange soda and because my partner was going to be picking me up I wanted to get him something special. His favorite drink is a mocha so I went and ordered a mocha. What happened next is very confusing to me.  I was told that this espresso bar stops serving espresso after 4. I'm not one to really complain but if you're going to call yourself and Espresso Bar possibly keep espresso on the menu the entire day. I did not see any signs that said no espresso after 4 but unfortunately I walked away with only my soda and no mocha.  I do like coming here since it is right down the street for me but that kind of turned me off. Maybe they ran out and had to stop serving after 4? One may never know. All I know is that my poor partner did not get a mocha. But he still came and pick me up so I guess that worked out. Very confusing.",

I'm not sure it could really replace cheese for me, but it's definitely good as it's own dish.  All of their dishes carefully flavored, a wonderful balance of spice, and the pita is soft and warm!

    "text": "This spot is 100% my favorite breakfast joint. I'm always down to explore the vegan restaurants in Pittsburgh and I'm so happy to have found B52! Located on Butler street, there's beautiful scenery, free (yes, free!) parking, and busy shops nearby!   Upon entering, the cafe is so quaint and cute. You seat yourself and the server comes over with the menu. Each time I've been here, the servers were very kind and knowledgeable about their menu items. They made suggestions of what we should order and gave us enough time to look over the menu.   After looking through some pictures on yelp, we decided to split the Kafta Tofu Scramble, an order of Latkes, and a blueberry pancake. We ordered a chocolate chip cookie for a starter with a cup of coffee. The coffee was promptly brought to us along with a side of almond milk. This cookie- oh my god. We're  always on the search for the best vegan chocolate chip cookie around and I'd say this is top 2 one of the best ones.   Now time for the main course. First of all, the portion sizes are HUGE. Big enough for 2 people to split and still be full. The seitan crumble along with the tofu scramble all pair perfectly with the side of steamed kale. It's like an explosion of flavors in your mouth. And the pitas are a great additive! They have the perfect crunch and make for the perfect bite. The latkes (potatoes) are so amazing. I don't know how they pack such a powerful taste in potatoes! So good. Lastly the pancake. Oh em gee. This pancake is like no other. I'm usually not a pancake person but you can NOT pass this up. They're so fluffy, packed with the perfect amount of blueberries, and HUGE. again, we split just one pancake. They're so amazing and definitely recommend.  All in all, I am obsessed with this place. I definitely try to make it out here at least once a week. 10/10!!!",

Came in on an early Sunday afternoon for brunch and was disappointed to find that the pancakes had sold out. I settled on  a piece of the peanut butter toast with raspberry preserves in addition to the cashew yogurt parfait (and a cafe rico, of course). SO GOOD. The peanut butter is made in house and was slathered generously on a thick piece of bread that was toasted to crispy-outside-meets-chewy-inside goodness. The yogurt parfait was absolutely delightful, topped with some thinly sliced banana and a touch of agave syrup. Together, these made a perfectly filling and satisfying brunch to the point where I wasn't upset about missing out on the fabled pancakes (though I anticipate coming back during the week to give them a whirl!).",

My friend and I both agreed that it was some of the best baba ghanoush we've ever had. Smoked eggplant is genius.   The kombucha I tried and almond milk I had in my coffee were also great and I learned they actually make both of those in-house!

It took us more than 30 mins to be seated. The decoration is very nice but the space is pretty small. They have lots of vegan food including cheese and hand-made chocolates that they bake themselves. The menu is medium-sized and decently explained. I had shiitake mushroom on flatbread and baba ganoush. My friends had falafel sandwich and avocado and raspberry toast with cashew cheese. It took them a long time to bring our beverages, but the food came in a decent time. My shiitake mushroom flatbread had too much kale and too little mushroom on it and it was greasy. Baba ganoush was delicious and falafel was good. The cactus drink had a weird aftertaste. None of us liked it. Their cashew cheese was delicious tho. In general I think they are short of staff. The food is good but not super delicious.",

The atmosphere is minimalist and rustic, while still maintaining a sense of warmth that's very inviting.  I was with my husband, who isn't crazy about \"weird, hippie food,\" and thus appropriately skeptical about this place, which holds itself out as a vegan/veg friendly establishment.  Well, he was pleasantly surprised!  From the coffee special (something amazing with homemade almond milk and orange essence) to the flat bread to the tofu scramble, everything we had was tasty, balanced, and well executed.  The service was attentive and helpful, and our waiter eagerly explained the things on the menu that we weren't familiar with.  All in all, this is a really unique new spot that is serving up some beautiful, delicious food in a lovely atmosphere.  What's not to like?",

My sister had the seitan shwarma which was incredible as well. The various soft drinks including the strawberry Italian soda I had were quite good as well.  Bottomline, great vegan food at a reasonable price. I also hear the truffles are great.",

The pancakes were pretty good and the Seitan/Tofu Scramble was decent as well. Skip the sausage - no one at the table was a fan. I'm not sure I'll be frequently B52 for the food, but for you vegans out there, I'm sure it's a great option. The service was also on point, and that goes a long way. Enjoy!",

We probably over ordered as everything on the menu looked good.  I feel like I should preface this by saying i'm not vegan or vegetarian.  My niece, who is 15, is debating whether she wants to become a vegetarian, so we like to occasionally take her to new places that she can try out.  B52 was a huge win on that front for all three of us.   This place was delicious.  I'd give it more than 5 stars if possible.  My boyfriend ordered the falafel sandwich. I have to echo other reviewers here, it was one of the best falafel sandwiches that I've tried.  It's crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside, with great flavor.  I ordered the avocado toast, which was delicious.  My niece ordered the Za'atar flat bread.  I tried and it really liked it.  I think she ordered it not quite understanding that it's not going to have  red sauce.  She thought it was a little dry.  We also ordered the mezze taste 3.  We got the Hummus, Fried tomatoes, and Baba Ghanouj.  I can not recommend getting the baba ghanouj enough. It was the best thing that I ate that day.  The smoked eggplant was phenomenal.  The fried tomatoes were a close second.  the hummus was also delicious.  I would have scraped the bowls clean if I wasn't sharing with two other people.  My niece and I had the house made sodas which were also a real treat,  They were really good.  This is a great spot.   It's definitely a must stop if you're in the Lawerenceville area.",

    "text": "I'm a huge meat eater so i wasn't particularily looking for a vegan place, but the menu looked great so we gave it a try.  and OMGGGG was it worth it! We had the seitan shwarma, pick 3 with pita: Labneh, Fried Cauliflower (with garlic and lemon and some crazy delicious sauce), and Fried Tomatos. I cannot begin to describe to you how incredibl and flavorful the Labneh was with just the right amount of mint and extra olive oil drizzled on top. It danced around my mouth and just made me want to smile the whole time i was eating it. I can't wait to bring friends and have them try it! Fried tomatos instantly made me think of fried green tomatoes so when they arrived and it was red tomatoes, I must admit i was disappointed. However misguided my disappointment, they were very tasty and my partner would certainly order it again cuz he scraped that bowl clean with his pita.there was a great drizzle of cream sauce (it might've been tahini but I couldn't put my finger on the flavor amidst the tomatoes) and what appeared to be a drizzle of green tomatoes also. Now, on to my favorite: the fried cauliflower. There's an incredible kick of a spice that screams Middle Eastern cuisine and the best texture from the frying that I've ever had for cauliflower! i'm a stickler for great texture and the crisp seasoned florets with the tender stalks was awesome an was paired with a great creamy sauce (again, might've been tahini with some spice, not 100% sure). To be honest, the worst part was that I ate it so fast that I didn't feel like I have enough of it (I was sharing with my partner)! Not to discount any of these amazing flavors, the seitan schwarma was also incredible. the texture of the romaine and the great pickled turnips went great with the shaved and sesasoned seitan!   For the record, ordering a pick 3 and a sandwich was PLENTY for 2 people. probably would've served 3 as we took home half of the sandwich and finished all of the sides instead. We also ordered a chickory root beverage that was unusual but good and the blood orange basil soda. The soda was oustanding, i would probably ask for an extra sprig of basil next time becauses I love basil and could've used just a touch more of it with the orange. Our total bill was $33 plus tax and they included an extra pita at no charge. Dont get me wrong, $40 after tip for lunch for 2 is not inexpensive, but we have another whole lunch another day. You could easily get out of there for less than $10 for lunch if you skip the drink",

Great soft music so you can still hold a conversation and the waitress was very friendly and helpful.  We ended up sharing a the Mezze \"Taste 6\" for $30 and that easily filled us up and everything was super delicious and fresh tasting.  I have been to Israel and dishes here would stack up well against anything I had there!! Be sure to save room for some vegan carrot cake. It was a big slice, big enough to share.  I did not miss the dairy at all, it was super rich and moist with icing that we fought over.  Oh, I also had a Chai latte with house made almond milk...loved the oversized mug!!

The spicy sauce on the side was just the right touch to push the dish from good to great, if you like a little heat. If not, then you'll probably want to skip the sauce, but it was perfect for me.  My son had the blueberry pancakes. They were soooooo good. He devoured them both and they were HUGE!  We also got a carry out for some other people that couldn't join us for breakfast. The zatar and onion flatbreads were delicious. Chewy, thin, warm bread with the right amount of toppings. The labneh was good too. As for desserts, the cookies are out-of-this-world good. Even non-vegans said they were the best chocolate chunk cookies they've ever had.  The only thing I didn't enjoy was the brewed coffee. It was VERY acidic and upset my stomach drinking it before the meal came (on an empty stomach). So if you don't like acidic coffee, try a latte or some chai :) All in all, excellent food. I wish we had one of these in Detroit - our vegan breakfast restaurants don't have as good of food as this place!!",

First and foremost, although I am not vegan, I greatly appreciate and love vegan food. I love that B52 is entirely vegan- Pittsburgh really needs more places like this. I came by on a weekday morning. There were some people sitting and eating but it overall wasn't very busy. While looking at the coffee menu, I nearly fell over when I read that they have \"house made almond and coconut milk\". WHAT?! How incredible is that? I cannot even think of another spot in Pittsburgh that has this as an option. I settled on a vanilla latte with their house made almond milk and could not believe the flavor- it was so good, and only around $5, which is extremely reasonable for the high quality of the drink. I also had to try their house made dark chocolate, which was super tasty, and their house made pomegranate lime kombucha- also absolutely insanely good. I basically left this place with my mouth wide open, I was so blown away by the fact that they make so many things from scratch. I am so excited to come back here again soon.",

And I've only eaten there  This is not an exaggeration: I think about the food at B52 at least once a week. And I've only eaten there twice!  Starting with the mezze -- the baba ghanouj was smoky and wonderful. The fried cauliflower was crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside and perfect with or without the accompanying tahini. I never thought cauliflower could taste so good! My favorite - and this is usually what I daydream about - is the labneh. Smooth, creamy, with just the right bite from the mint. Heavenly!   The kebab with seitan came on a bed of rice with a little salad and veggies on the side of the plate. The cucumber yogurt was cool and refreshing, the perfect accompaniment the the hearty and savory seitan.  If you're looking for something on the lighter side, the manakish (flatbread) is a good bet! I had the cashew cheese manakish and it was so delightful! The crust was just the right amount, not too thick or too thin, and the cashew cheese had a bit of a bite that went well with the slightly sweet tomato sauce.  B52 might just be my favorite food in the city!",

The atmosphere during the mid-morning on a weekday was really relaxing and nice. The service was impeccable from start to finish as well. I can only imagine how great brunch is!  I started with coffee and was given ice water along with it without having to ask, which I appreciated. The coffee was a definitely a cut above what most cafes serve in terms of flavor. My friend and I both got the avocado toast, and I ordered a cinnamon roll after seeing them brought straight from the oven. The cinnamon roll was absolute perfection, and I'm already looking forward to having another. The avocado toast was perfectly executed on fluffy bread with a hint of lemon and sesame seeds on top. It's still rare to find avocado anything in Pittsburgh, so B52 is a breath of fresh air in that regard. With such great food and a host of interesting-sounding coffee drinks and other things to try, I know I'll be back very shortly.",

I was in Pittsburgh visiting and had no clue where to find good vegan/vegetarian food, I looked on yelp and decided B52 is where I should go based on previous reviews...   From the moment I walked in I could tell this place was going to be good. After asking the server what he suggested I figured I'd get the falafel sandwich with the soup of the day, which I was so lucky it was my favorite: LENTIL SOUP... now I've had lentil soup hundreds of times (seriously) the moment I had my first spoonful I was like \"HOLY S*%^\" it was the best lentil soup no the best soup I've ever had in my life period. The falafel sandwich was also soooo delicious!   My favorite part aside from the amazing food would definitely be the customer service, my server was amazing and super helpful, the barista was also awesome and really fun to talk to, but the OWNER-OMAR stopped by my table and had a genuine conversation with me and truly wanted to know what I thought of the food and was just so amazing!   I will be making B52 a regular part of my routine whenever I'm in Pittsburgh and you should to!!",

Breakfast is my favorite; portions are massive! The tofu scramble with the seitan is definitely a crowd favorite-huge portion, amazing flavor, so filling, and zero regret. Do not forget to use their house-made Harissa sauce--perfectly spicy! Also do not pass up on a drink. They make a ton of in-house drinks (truly everything is made in-house, from scratch). I've had the best vanilla lattes from here; made with homemade nut milk and chunks of fresh vanilla bean. Also they rotate different in-house kombucha flavors which are also always delicious. Can't wait to see what other menu items evolve and can't wait until my next visit. Oh don't leave without grabbing a sweet treat to go. Everything is vegan. The owner also owns Allegro Hearth Bakery on Murray Ave in squirrel Hill; if you haven't been yet, get there soon! Traditional, simple, delicious European style bread.",

So, I was excited to try the food, being open to vegan food because of my egg allergy.   We walked right in and were promptly seated by a sweet and casual waitress. They have an espresso bar as well as an impressive list of teas. I elected to try their Americano, and my friend had the mint tea. Both drinks were delicious and the perfect start to a rainy afternoon lunch.  For food, I ordered the sauteed shiitake as well as the hummus. Because I eat gluten free I opted for veggies with the hummus, which was an up charge. The kale and mushrooms were very garlicky and full of flavor, and a nice portion. The hummus was creamy and topped with paprika and olive oil. It was delicious, with the veggies or just by itself! My friend ordered a flatbread and added cashew cheese. She let me taste a bite of the the cheese, and it is very smooth and tasty. If I knew what regular cheese tasted like I could better compare the two, but due to being lactose intolerant I leave the cheese tasting to my husband.  The service was a little spotty at times and the barista actually had to come get our bills for us, but overall it was a lovely experience and I hope to return soon!",

    "text": "I was walking around Lawrenceville with a friend on Easter Sunday and lots of places were closed. The ones that were open, were packed and the wait time was out of this world. So we were strolling around and came across B52, which surprisingly could seat us straight away. The place is quite small and cozy and they have lots of tables for 2.   Our waiter was really nice and fun and explained the menu for us. We then decided to order a couple of things and share them between the two of us. For the drinks I ordered a normal coffee and a freshly squeezed orange juice. And for the food we had thick cut toast with almond spread and raspberry jam, the cashew cheese flat-bread and yogurt with compote.  I do have to say, that charging $3.5 for a kids glass of OJ is a bit outrageous. I get it, it's organic, it's fresh etc, but really. The portion size was also rather on the small side for the price. The taste, however, was amazing and I did enjoy all the items that we have ordered.  All in all, I did enjoy my experience at B52. You can taste, that all the items on the menu are being prepared freshly, which is the reason I can look over the price in the end.  It's definitely \"different\" and fresh, which is the reason I would definitely come back for another brunch/lunch.",

I only had a few sips since it wasn't actually my drink, so I never did figure out where I fell on the citrus-coffee combo!  Great atmosphere, friendly and patient service.

They have these rules about everything which have become seriously annoying.  First it was no espresso coffee drinks after 4 p.m.  They shut down the machine and you can't order anything like a latte, a cappuccino, nothing except for regular coffee.  If you try to order a piece of cake you may only have a small slice and that's it.  It is an expensive slice and you feel ripped off with the size of it.  The third rule that pushed me over the edge is that they don't serve sandwhiches at brunch on Sunday, only salads.  My girlfriend wanted their falafel pita and we went down there to get one, but she couldn't get one because of this stupid arbitrary rule.  I mean, she just wanted a fucking falafel sandwhich, couldn't you just make her one?  She was however aloud to order a falafel salad, WTF?  It is always packed to the gills on the weekend and you have to sit around and wait with 20 other people in a small confined space.  I am done with this place, sorry.",

My husband and I have been vegan for 6 years; and the veggie scene in Pittsburgh is getting so exciting. The first time I came to B52, no one even told me it was vegan. My friend just told me that it was Mediterranean; which was totally cool, because I knew that I could at least get hummus and veggies. But when I saw the menu, I died of sheer joy. I could eat EVERYTHING!!!   To my pleasant surprise, the owner is also the head chef, and runs the kitchen; not just someone who saw a great location and wanted to capitalize on real estate and pander to the demographic. Meaning, the food is MADE with love, care, and attention to detail. Not frozen food simply heated up and assembled.  They make everything IN-HOUSE. Their almond milk, hummus, cashew \"cream\" cheese, and baked goods. At this point, I have tried everything on the menu, and have NEVER been disappointed.  During Sunday Brunch, if you get there right at 9am, you'll get seated right away. However, the place is also a small cafe, so groups larger than 4 may have to wait even longer. The place also fills up quick. BUT - worth the wait for the Sourdough Buckwheat Pancakes, which we always get with Blueberries (or you can add bananas, or both). My husband and I always tend to split the Tofu Scramble as well, to satisfy our savory side. Whatever they do to their scrambled tofu is pure magic. The Latkes are also better than any of our old family recipes (but PLEASE do not tell that to my Aunts and Great-Aunts - they might keel over). Also, even if you just go for a coffee (Cafe Rico - hot - is totally worth a try!!) and Thick Cut Toast, you'll be pleasantly surprised at how full you may be.   For lunch - anything on the menu is totally awesome. But the Falafel or Seitan Schwarma sanwiches (with Fries - TOTALLY get the fries!!!) are tied for my favorites. Ever since Station Street Hot Dogs disappeared, I couldn't find a worthy falafel contender. But this falafel is better than anything I've had anywhere. Again - don't tell my Aunts that.   Dinner starts at 5pm, and you can't go wrong with a Mezze platter, flatbread, or entree. No matter what I have tried - I roll my eyes back into my head and think, \"How do they do it?!\"  Desserts - pick ANY of them. And if you don't say, \"this isn't vegan?!\" then you can call me any dirty name that you want to. Seriously. My favorites are the Cinnamon Roll and Baklava, but the cookies and brownies are worth sharing as they are dense and delicious. I'm not sharing my Cinnamon Roll though. Get you're own.   They also have a quick Grab and Go section at the front to take home any of their great items. We have taken some cashew cheese, hummus, and pitas with us on road trips or for a picnic in the park, and it's the perfect snack to keep us going.  On top of the great food, and friendly staff, B52 always seems to be playing kick ass music as well. My husband and I joke that B52 feeds both our stomachs and our souls, as we are usually SoundHounding what's playing through the speakers. Our favorite find - Os Mutantes \"A Mehia Menina\" - 60's Brazilian Pop Song. Super fun and catchy.  Overall, B52 has replaced the hole in our hearts that Quiet Storm left. Yet, in letting any old things go, you make room for the better.",

Went with a friend for lunch and this place was pretty packed,,,, UHHHHHH now I know why.  The food here is STELLAR !!!!  I have to say again, the Falafel is beyond amazing and I would have eaten a few dozen of them if I wanted to be gluttonous.    The menu is brilliant and I totally recommend getting the 3 tastings of DIP w/warm pita.  OH MY... delicious.  They also have an array of fresh baked goods.  Honestly, I NEED to go back here; there is too much to try to make an informed review.  LOVED IT !!!  DELICIOUS !!  WILL be back.",

It's just such a great environment, I can't help myself!  It's all vegan... And while I'm not vegan myself, it doesn't matter! You don't need meat or dairy to have excellent food in my opinion. Everything I've had has been fantastic. I especially love 5 different \"mezze\" dishes you can pick 1, 3 or all 6 of for a deal. You can go with either hummus, fried cauliflower, baba ghanouj, fried tomatoes, falafel or labneh. I always get the cauli (it comes with this insanely good dipping sauce), baba and fried tomatoes. It also comes with fresh pita bread to dip or just eat plain. Great for sharing or if you want to try a variety of items.   I also love the Falafel salad. While the falafel is good, I also can't get enough of the pickled turnips, which they actually sell sometimes as a grab and go item. You also can't go wrong with any of their homemade sodas or coffee bar drinks. Every time I come I can't just get a plain water. I have to get the featured drink.   I still haven't Trued their brunch, which I'm excited to check out sometime. I have NO doubt it will be sometime soon. Speaking of which, you should also get there soon...",

I ordered the lavender latte with coconut milk, it was delicious. Then I got the falafel salad for lunch which was also delicious and filling. The salad was huge and had 4-5 falafels on it. I was so stuffed by the end of meal, I ended up taking half of the salad home!",

Seitan Shwarma, the thinnest-sliced seitan and crunchy pickled turnips make for a filling and flavorful sandwich. The Cashew Cheese flatbread, a smooth and creamy cruelty-free cheese, and at 7 bucks, a great value. Oh, and of course, the fried cauliflower = amazing. I promise you'll gobble it up like you've never gobbled a veggie before.  Not to mention the full coffee bar (including nitro coffee!) and delicious baked goods. I'm def partial to the Cafe Rico and the brownie as my after-meal follow-up. And the house made sodas? So refreshing.  Thanks, B52, for providing inventive and creative vegan foods options.",

    "text": "I came here for supper but I hope I end up going back sometime earlier in the day. B52 has the standard cafe equipment and high end coffee that certainly are worth returning for. I didn't have any but apparently their floral lattes are a thing. They also stock the good pita, humus, and some other Middle Eastern staples. I wish I had tried more of them.   I ordered moussaka which was loosely interpreted by layering eggplant, a seitan/tomato sauce, eggplant and cashew cheese. Not the square cut from the pan you get a a greek diner but this was far superior. At first I was a little freaked out how closely their seitan approximated a meat sauce. The cashew cheese is really something I feel like I have only ever had like that at this restaurant. Tangy and thick, very similar to a dairy soft cheese. Had I not been traveling without a place to refrigerate it I would have most certainly purchased some to take home with me.   The meal also included broccoli, saffron rice, and beats. I ordered a pot of tea with it and two house made chocolates at the end. I ate my meal at the bar which was a little cramped but there was a larger communal table I could have moved to if it was more of an imposition.   The service was prompt and the price seemed just right given the product and location quality. The meal here made my night.",

    "text": "I think like a lot of meat eaters, I was a bit apprehensive about eating at a vegan restaurant. Not because I don't like vegetables or appreciate vegan cuisine, I just think that lots of restaurants who \"do\" vegan food cop out by putting lots of salads or other raw dishes on the menu and not really cooking quality food. You will not have that problem at the B-52 Cafe.   I started with a turmeric latte, which was tasty on warming on a chilly rainy day. The food is really outstanding. When we were eating our food it was easy to forget that you were in a vegan restaurant, The food is tasty and filling, the Middle Eastern flavors are bold and make you really not miss the protein that many non-vegans might. The baba ghanouj was smoky and flavorful.  I think that this is a dish that is often bitter and not well-made in many restaurants. I'm usually not a big hummus person at all I tend to feel as if it all taste the same way. But this hummus was very delicious. It was smooth and creamy with just the right amount of garlic. We also had a Za'atar Flatbread, topped with an abundance of spices and what I believe was both sesame and olive oil, it left me wanting seconds.   The pita bread is honestly to die for. It is light and fluffy and not at all what comes to mind when you think stereotypical vegan baking.  I've never really tried to find any vegan or vegetarian places in the city of Pittsburgh, but this is a solid recommendation to have in my back pocket for friends who are vegan or vegetarian.",
