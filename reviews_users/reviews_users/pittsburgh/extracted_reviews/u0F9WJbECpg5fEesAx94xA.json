The service is seems intentionally slow to give you space, not out of neglect. The prices are fair, but this place has table service, so my lunch with a soft drink was $16, after tip.",

    "text": "Did you know this is the only Colombian restaurant in OH, PA and WV? Neither did I, but it is! I'm a big fan of central/South American food and wow - did this place deliver! The fresh juices (might I recommended Pineapple/mint - so fresh) and the flavorful dishes are carefully selected and all made fresh in house. The menu isn't huge, which helps narrow down your choices for those who can't make decisions (like myself). My husband and I split an order of empanadas and then a dinner entree, which was a little light - so you may want to make sure you order enough to satiate yourself. The good news is you can always order more. The sweet plantains that come with the entrees are my favorite! Think a mix between a sweet potato and a banana. The rice and beans are delicious - and great big red beans are used. The empanadas are accompanied by your choice of three house made sauces. The house hot sauce isn't too hot but is very fresh and flavorful! The beef empanadas is what I will recommend to go along with this. The only disappointment? The arepas. My past experience with arepas were sweet corn cakes with cheese. These are hominy white corn and very dry. Maybe that's how they are supposed to taste, but they weren't very good according to this westernized palate. :(  I plan on going back soon, so I'll add more next time!",

    "text": "This restaurant is everything! Being from Colombia,, my wife as well, we can guarantee that this food is very authentic. The menu recently expanded from a soft menu to a full wide selection of foods! It's incredible! The service started out kinda rough as they were Sooo busy and understaffed. It's has improved night and day! My favorite is the reina pepiada arepa, arepa burger, and la bandeja paisa! OMG! Sooo good! It's the only colombina restaurant within hundreds of miles! Try it! Embrace the music, the authentic people. Working there, and the decor. For us, it brings us back to our beloved country of colombia . We've been 6 times in less than 2 months! Let's keep this place open for many years!",

The quantities also feel just right - neither too much or too little and good for the pricing.  The place: 4 stars Very nice size, warmly lit, simple attractive decor.  The people: 5 stars Super nice and attentive  Overall service: 2 stars We have been here several times and the overall service has been inconsistent. We haven't had a properly orchestrated experience here yet, and our latest was really off. We received our entrees first, after we were completely done eating, our drinks came out, and then some of our appetizers after that. It feels like they were understaffed and were struggling to keep up, even though the crowd was modest in size. Please fix this before it's too late.",

    "text": "It's great that Pittsburgh has authentic arepas and other Colombian fare to nosh. The cornmeal based arepas can be eaten as-is or stuffed with a variety of savory fillings. And their tostones are larger than life and dangerously delicious -- don't leave without trying these. I opted for the mainstream ropa vieja; while not that appealing to the eye, it's bursting with flavor. Additionally, I'm not a big fan of black bean side dishes, but their version I found surprisingly good. The space is airy and welcoming; the decor while traditional, brightened up the space. Service was relatively fast and efficient, but could use some more polish. All in all, I hope The Colombian Spot makes a good run in the \"Sahside\" as you can never have enough international options when it comes to food in this town!",

    "text": "I love, love, love Colombian food. It's like home to me. Anyway, when I head that a Colombian stand was opening at Pittsburgh Market, I knew I had to try it out.  First off, their menu is slightly limited due to the size of their small kitchen. They mainly offer empanadas (beef, pork, chicken and vegetarian), juices made Colombian style with a variety of tropical fruits (you can mix it up with either water or milk), and stuffed arepas with a variety of protein or a vegetarian option.  Anyway, we came in on the weekend due to their special which was beef sancocho, which is a typically a beef or chicken based soup with plantains, yuca, and potatoes, in addition to some other yummy stuff. My husband opted for the bandeja paisa, which has ground beef, sweet plantains, home made porkrinds, rice, avocado, and an egg on top all accompanied with a side of bean.    After making our order, the soup came right away. We were both ravenous so we ate it not knowing that a side of rice, plantains and avocado came with it (they didn't tell us) and it was brought in about 5 min after the soup.   Then the bandeja paisa came in so we shared that as well. We did notice the beans were missing, but hoped they would bring them as they had premade a lot of the food and were heating it up in the microwave.  We actually had to go up to them to remind them of our beans, and an empanada that we had also ordered.   I will say I loved the food, but the timing was a little off. I wish there was more communication on their part in terms of what goes with the special, before we gobble everything up. I do get the fact that this place had opened 2 weeks ago and they are probably getting used to working out the kinks. Which is why I didn't take off more stars. Timing can be a big deal.   If you haven't checked this place out, do yourself a favor and try it out. It's really tasty!!",

    "text": "Finding this ethnic vendor inside the Public Market was a delight, especially since there aren't really any other Colombian places in the city. Both the menu and seating area are quite small, which is fine since it's not a full restaurant. Their signature dish, the bandeja paisa, is a great one since it has so many different components, allowing you to try different types of food. The sausage was cooked just right and had a lot of flavor, while the egg and shredded meat complemented the rice well. The pork belly and plantains were a bit overdone, but overall still very tasty. We did not get a side arepa, but we did enjoy the soup of red beans on the side. While the dish could have been a bigger portion or a few dollars cheaper, it was good overall.  They also offer juices and drinks, both bottled and freshly made. We ordered a lulo juice, made from a citrus type of fruit. It tasted a bit different from oranges, and was very delicious.",

Even if you don't get mango, you should still get some type of fruit juice.  After hearing the daily special, I ordered it. It was a Colombian version of chicken soup. It came with big hunks of tender white meat chicken, potatoes, and corn. Then they brought you a small plate that had rice, fresh avocado slices, a white sauce, and capers. I dumped it all in. Holy Cow!  This is chicken soup on crack!!  The avocado and white sauce made the broth like velvet. The capers brought some brightness. I would have never thought to put avocados or capers in chicken soup but now I will! I ate every drop of that soup. I was too full for dessert.  I will be heading back soon to try their empanadas!!",

Their empanadas are crispy on the outside and deliciously seasoned on the inside. Really a perfect appetizer or lunch if your heart desires.  Their arepas and plantains are just as good and delicious and worth every bite. I recommend getting a side salad or guac to get some greens in, just because Columbian food is pretty focused on meat and starches- Other than that, worth the time and money for certain.",

My friend and I went down for an early dinner on a Friday night-I try to avoid being in the South Side much later on the weekends! But I didn't need to worry so much. 5 blocks down was insanity. This part of East Carson is relatively quiet in comparison. Our server was very attentive and friendly and explained the parts of each dish that we weren't familiar with very thoroughly. He was happy to sub out a different kind of meat in my friend's dish.  It's BYOB with a corkage fee of $5, so definitely reasonable. We got the Tostones con guacamole and the guac was nice and chunky-just how I like it. At our server's recommendation, we each got variations on the Ropa Vieja- shredded beef stewed in a tomato sauce with beans, rice, and plantains on the side. Delicious! It was so tender and perfectly seasoned, and--this may be my favorite part about the experience--plenty of sauces at varying levels of spice were provided to alter the dish just to your own tastes.   I can't wait to go back and try more authentic Colombian dishes. Very tasty food, good prices, and good service.",

The menu does include some dishes from other Latin American countries, but the Colombian specialties are right on target. You could just fill yourself up with empanadas and call it a meal. My only observation is that I wish they could provide real \"aji\" dressing with them, as opposed to some tabasco based concoction. Another suggestion is that if they were to add the famous \"ajiaco\" soup to the menu, this restaurant would be significantly adding to the quality of life in Pittsburgh especially in the winter! Cinco estrellas (five stars)!",

It's a cute set-up with a casual atmosphere.   I honestly am not too familiar with Columbian food, but you know you can trust this place because the couple who own the spot are both from there. I ordered the Colentado con Carna Asada. It's grilled sirloin with rice, beans and a fried egg on top. The owner told me it's actually a traditional breakfast meal. I'd have this meal any time of the day though!  Everything had so much flavor, I was floored. The extra bonus is the four sauces that are served to compliment the meal. I couldn't tell you what each was, but seriously, each one was incredibly flavorful. The great thing too is 95% of the menu is gluten free!  You need to get here ASAP, no more waiting! Plus, bring your fave bottle of vino because it's BYOB!",

    "text": "We decided to try The Columbian Spot based on the many positive reviews.  Being from South Florida, we've been craving some good traditional Latin food.  We went there for dinner on a Thursday evening.  Upon entering, we noticed it was fairly small.  The sign asked us to seat ourselves, so we chose a table in the center of the restaurant.  After a few minutes, the server came over with menus and took our drink order.  After viewing the menu, I noticed the dishes were sort of a combination of traditional Columbian dishes with some other \"Latin\" dishes mixed in.  The arepas and empanada dishes were all traditional, however, there were other items like Ropa Vieja (Cuban), Pernil (Puerto Rican), and black beans (red beans are traditional Colombian fare).   We decided to try the Tostones con Guacamole as an appetizer.  The flavor was good and the guac was very tasty.  I'm used to getting traditional garlic butter sauce as an accompaniment to the Tostones, so for me, they were a tad on the dry side.  However, the amount of guac was good for the price.  For our entrees, the hubby decided on the Calentado con Carne Asada.  I opted to try their \"Build Your Own Special\" and chose the top sirloin with black beans and rice.  The hubby got a decent sized steak, the fried egg on top was cooked correctly and the rice and beans had good flavor.  My steak, however, was paper thin.  It was literally thinner than a slice of roast beef at the deli counter.  Therefore, the steak was terribly over cooked and tough.  The black beans were good and I enjoyed them with the rice.  They were flavorful and were, for me, by far the best part of my meal.  In the end, the service was prompt and friendly.  The convenient location in the South Side will most likely be a draw for the local South Side crowd.  However, paying over $45 for a meal consisting of underwhelming food does not bode well for us.  We don't feel like this place is worth a second visit, so I'll just continue making my Latin favorites at home.",

    "text": "This place is SO reasonably priced, and the food is of incredible quality! Everything we tried was so fresh, and you can try a variety of things without breaking the bank.  The Sirope WAS good, but my friend's Mint Lemonade was just Divine! Sirope is definitely a must-try though, because it is different than what most places have to offer. It is not sickeningly sweet, but a fantastic balance of sweet and cinnamony. I love cinnamon, and this drink was a big hit as far as I'm concerned. I'll probably alternate between ordering that and the Mint Lemonade in the future.  We tried Chicken, Vegetarian, and Beef Empanadas. I love a good veggie empanada, but theirs is not filled with veggies... instead, it contains rice and beans. Still good, but I'd prefer some vegetables. The chicken was my favorite, the spices were on point, and the filling was so gooey and satisfying.  My favorite dish was an appetizer: Maduros con Tocienta y Queso. It is sweet plantains, covered in bacon and cheese. They are NOT JOKING about the cheese, which I respect deeply (cheese is serious business), and the bacon was decent size pieces, not meager little bacon bits. This is the PERFECT Sunday morning appetizer, seriously!  I have already been back, and will return many times in the future, I'm sure! Empanadas are something I can go for pretty much anytime, and trust me; The Columbian Spot's empanadas are where it's at!",

I was very suspicious towards the end that the waiter was on to me being a yelper but I could have just been paranoid. I only took some pictures!   Anyway, we walked in and got ignored (the restaurant was decently empty). We walked towards the back to talk to the waiters who said we could sit wherever we wanted. The service was slow and I continued to be mostly ignored. The waiter was foreign and confused our order a bit but it turned out okay.   I ordered a mint lemonade which was seriously so delicious. I love mint! Very sweet but not deadly sweet. We ordered veggie empanadas to share. Very hard and crispy exterior. When I stuck my knife in, it flew off the table and onto the floor. The filling was good, but mediocre.  Then, suddenly when we wanted to order our main dishes, our waiter treated us like queens!! He gave suggestions and talked to us for a bit. We ordered Arepa de queso con maduros. It was a very bizarre dish but also quite good! The inside was cheesy and sweet. Surprisingly filling as well. It was served with huuuge plantains on the side which were salted, and that balanced the sweetness of the arepa.   Then our waiter suggested we order the Tres Leches (I will never refuse cake) and it was INCREDIBLE. Best thing I had. It was soft and when you stuck your fork in, the bottom part of the cake would literally melt into the bottom of the plate. Our waiter also gave us two small coffees to go with it; for free! I left the restaurant feeling great. I will come back and try some other things. Or at the very least just to eat that cake!!!",

    "text": "Stopped here for lunch since I never ate here at the Pittsburgh Public market. Their specialties are arepas with different fillings and a Columbian beverage called Sirope. I wasn't sure I was going to like the Sirope since it is made from sugar cane pulp but it wasn't overbearingly sweet. I really liked it.  My waitress helped explain the various items on the menu and was attentive to my needs.  In addition to their specialty juices they  serve soft drinks and Columbian coffee or hot tea. I ordered the chicken arepas with avocado and a side of sweet plantains. The meal was very good and very filling. Prices are reasonable so unless you have a big appetite one arepa would be sufficient. You get a choice of side with it anyway.   Everything is made fresh to order and my waitress brought me condiments to go with it but I thought my arepa was just right without having to add more to it.   The place is very small with a bar in the back. Restrooms are down a flight of stairs. The Columbian decor is very nice and this place is definitely a must return for me. It is located in the 21st block in Southside.",

    "text": "Ordered: Tostones con todo, Picada, Sirope Price: $12.95 + 34.95 + 3.50 (respectively)  Ambiance: The place is tastefully decorated with lots of  Columbian paraphernalia on the walls. The color choices are warm and inviting but the place is a little on the dim side which is why the yelp pics are all dark. Service is friendly though and it's self seating which is nice for spacing yourself out.  Food: I really enjoyed the sirope drink which tastes like a refreshing apple cider; sweet, lightly citrusy, and hint of cinnamon. I'd recommend the Tostones con todo which is basically a 6 tostada sampler topped with ropa vieja (stewed beef), carnitas, or a light non-spicy \"creole\" salsa. The dish gives a very broad sampling of their range and was perfect for sharing with 2 people. The fried plantains are crispy, mild tasting, and fragrant which make it a fun blank slate to pile on other flavors. They are not like the sweet plantains of Jamaican food. We shared the picada which was a huge bowl of salad greens, French fries, fried plantains, and a TON of grilled meats. The chicken was truly excellent being smokey, moist, and perfectly tender. The beef was surprisingly tender as well, only a few pieces were on the medium-well side but otherwise cooked a perfect medium. The \"hotdogs\" were surprisingly the star of the dish. They are not your ballpark variety but are high-quality dogs bursting with beefy flavor and smokey grilled flavor, absolutely delicious. The picada can easily feed 3, likely 4, people as we had a whole second meal with the left overs. The plain arepa on top of the dish was dry, dense, and flavorless so I kind of ignored it.  Overall my wife and I really enjoyed our experience and would gladly come back. Columbian Spot offers unique, high-quality food that is well-cooked, generously portioned, and fairly priced. Would definitely check this place out.",

    "text": "Sometimes, a great restaurant can seem like world travel. If you enjoy adventurous eating, I recommend you head to the new Columbian Spot.  Many of you may remember their booth in the former Public Market, these are the same owners.  Because I visited on the day of the St Patrick's Day Parade, they had a limited menu, but I still got to sample many of their trademark dishes.  First, the empanadas and fantastic. Slightly different that Argentine empanadas, but remarkably delicious.  Then I tried the soup special, which is served with rice, special sauce, and a wedge of avocado.  It reminded me of a traditional Brazilian soup, again very tasty and unusual.  I ended with the Columbian Loaded Hamburger, which is much more exotic and flavorful than or traditional hamburgers.  If you are vegetarian, I highly recommend the Vegan empanadas.  I didn't have space to try the Tres Leches, but I'll be back soon because it's my all time favorite dessert.  To drink I had the Mango con leche, which was whipped light and flavorful.  My server was helpful in guiding me through the menu and was attentive. The music and ambience was authentic Columbian and rather casual and comfortable.  BYOB with a $5 corkage per table.",

    "text": "My son & I decided to grab a bite for lunch between running errands on Sunday. Wanting to try something new and different, we decided to find out what The Columbian Spot had to offer. What a treat! We decided to try two different arepas so that we could sample both. The Arepas, themselves, were per perfectly baked with a wonderful corn flavor.  The Arepa Paisa was filled to overflowing with a combo of red beans, rice, very flavorful chorizo, slow-simmered shredded beef (ropa viejo = \"rags\"), and, the star of the sandwich - crispy and succulent pork belly. The Arepa Mixta, again, abundantly stuffed with more of that wonderful pork belly, shredded beef, and shredded chicken that were seasoned with familiar tastes, but the combinations created new taste sensations. The warm afternoon called for frosty drinks and the coconut lemonades complemented both temperature and the Arepas. On the side, we loved the maduros - fried green plantain, that paired well with an aioli sauce that sits in squeeze bottles on every table. Tasty, well-prepared food served well and fairly priced ( I can well imagine the effort on the shredded beef, alone). My best recommendation is that we plan to return with friends to sample more of what the menu offers.",

Ordered the vegetarian Arepas Rellenas and wasn't too impressed with the actual arepas--the dough seemed a little dry, but maybe that's the way it should be. It was very simple, just stuffed with rice and beans. However my side of the sweet plantains was the highlight of my meal, cooked to perfection, so sweet and a very generous portion as my side. My boyfriend ordered a meat stuffed arepas and thought the same thing about his, however his side of fries were pretty delicious. We started with the guacamole which was great, served with fried green plantains--they were so big, but were just a bit too salty. Would definitely go back and like to try something other than the Arepas Rellenas.",

I ordered the Ensalada Tropical, described as Greens, Avocado, Cucumbers, Tomatoes, Seasonal Fruit, Queso, etc... The good news is, the ingredients were fresh. The bad news is, the seasonal fruit was a few sliced green apples - not what I had in mind for a tropical salad. Granted, this isn't a traditional Columbian dish, but my other two guests were slightly underwhelmed with their very traditional dishes. This does NOT mean I won't go back. The staff is friendly and the menu is unique. But next time I'll try dinner instead of brunch.",

They were absolutely delicious - the best we've ever tasted by far. The sauces they were served with were excellent.  My husband tried one of the native dishes and loved it, while I went for a chicken arepa with avocado and mayo. It was great. So were the green plantains that came on the side.  The one note about the food was that everything needed a little bit of seasoning, but we would rather add more than have too much!   The reason for four stars? The service was slow. Like...really REALLY slow. It was after lunchtime on a Saturday and the restaurant wasn't full. We didn't mind much, but other customers in the restaurant made a point to vocalize their opinions to the staff. It took us about ten minutes just to get menus once we sat down. The waiter was really nice and helpful, just clearly needed some more people working.  That being said, this girl will be back to the Colombian Spot if not just for a few more of those empanadas!",

San Andreas has 4.5 star, right next to the right side of the beach, on the water. Cali, and most places in Colombia rate 3 to 4.5 stars.   Atlanta has 3 to 4 stars and many more dishes. While I would return to this place, that's why I gave it 3 stars. It is very Americanized, and is missing many Colombian dishes.  Of the 3 Colombian restaurants in Atlanta this is a half star behind. They need to improve the Chicharron, and add several more itmes.   I miss my Colombian restaurant's in New York, two 5 star places within two blocks of each other. Better than Colombia places, but sadly no diet apple soda :( only in Colombia do you get great diet apple soda.   I miss Cali :(  Had a laugh at the dish, Colombian hot dog, I never ate a hot dog in Colombia. It is not on any Colombian menu I have ever seen, well except this menu.",

The service was prompt, friendly, and attentive. We ordered the milk based mango drink, which was creamy and sweet. I definitely recommend trying one of their five flavored milk drinks. I ordered the Ropa Vieja arepa with shredded beef in a stewed tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. It was tender, juicy, and flavorful. It didn't even need the vinegar based hot sauce and cilantro aioli that he brought out to us, but the they were too good not to use. The plantains were a good sweet addition to the arepa.  I ordered the side salad to go with my arepa. The dressing was lacking flavor so I slyly squirted some of the free dressing I got from the regatta on it, which made it better. I think the dressing would be fine with some more vinegar. The fries were good though.   I am excited to go back and try some of the other menu items! I recommend picking up a six pack at the Carson st deli since it's a BYOB.",

I ordered the bistec a caballo as my entree. The steak was a little chewy, but mostly tender. The whole meal in itself was delicious, though. The sauce that covered the steak was beautiful, and clearly homemade. The rice had a fried egg on top of it, and it all came together very nicely. The milk based smoothies are really thick and flavorful (I recommend them as a dessert).   I never really crave this type of food because the majority of the dishes are red meat/pork, which I'm not really a fan of, but the steak was still delicious. They have a few vegetarian options I'd be interested to try, but very little chicken dishes on the menu. I think I saw like 5 or 6 tops.

I kinda wish it came with some kind of vegetable or a pickled thing of some kind though since it's lots of meat and fried things.",

I got the Arepa burger with a side salad.   The arepa burger was different from anything I've ever had. It had great flavors and was giant, I only ate maybe half of it. It was a little difficult to eat because it was so big but I left the tinfoil around it which helped to keep it together. I enjoyed the hint of pineapple it had, it gave the burger a nice sweet after taste.   The side salad was surprisingly big! It was a great salad, just simple mixed greens carrots cucumber and tomato but the vegetables were all very fresh and the dressing was delicious. The dressing was sweet and creamy and tasted like mango/pineapple.",

Let's start with the rice, just plain white rice, which was the best rice I've ever eaten. I'm not sure what they do to it but be sure to get extra. This also goes for the beans. They have red and black bean soups that go perfectly with the delicious rice.   I tried the empanadas beef, chicken,  and spinach.  They were a little different than the empanadas I've had before.  More of a fried corn shell than the pastry I'm used to . They were very good and flavorful.   The Ensalada Tropical was a fresh salad with fruit and a great dressing.   I tried the cheese areapa which was fluffy and chewy cheesey greatness.  The star of the show was the Pechuga con Salsa de Champinones Grilled chicken covered in mushroom sauce. It was like a Colombian chicken alfredo. This dish is ridiculously good, lick the plate good, \"are you going to finish that?\" Good!   The staff was very helpful and gave me all of the accompanying sauces to make this a wonderful meal.   I didn't do dessert but they do have a passion fruit flan that looked amazing.   Was everything down with a fresh fruit juice.  I went with the Lulo a tangy, citrus-like fruit juice.   A bright and colorful interior. Great friendly service.",

    "text": "Deep fried food? Check. Melt in your mouth pork belly, carnitas, or chicken? Check. GLUTEN FREE?! Check!   The Colombian Spot has become my weekend lunch hot spot (Visiting 4 times in the last 2 months). When you walk in, you're transported into a tastefully decorated place with \"Colombian\" flags, pictures, and maps. The Latin music that plays puts everyone in a good mood too!   As soon as you sit down, you experience great service, delicious hot food.  All with decent prices!   At the table there are three sauces you can eat with your food, a ketchup mayo sauce, cilantro garlic, and a salsa!   There are a variety of appetizers including tostone chips (Sampler style is my recommendation with carnitas, marinated beef, or tomato-onion creole sauce), sweet plantains with bacon and cheese, or empandas!!! The EMPANDAS are heavenly. I've never experienced gluten free empandas, or seen them as an option. Here, they come in vegetarian, beef or chicken with potato. The vegetarian is mostly rice and beans (it's okay, not my pick), the chicken is filled with shredded chicken and mostly potatoes, and the beef is by far my favorite one.   Entree wise - the arepas are the main attraction here. For those with gluten allergies, this is a great opportunity to have a BIG sandwich. For everyone else, I love eating the meat and saving room for more tostones. The Ropa vieja (stewed/marinated beef) is my favorite. Its a little corn pocket stuffed with beef, cotija cheese and plantains. I've also had the grilled chicken (pounded thin with a LOT of smokey grill flavor) with white mushroom sauce and a side of rice and soup.   Come here with friends or come alone for lunch. It takes comfort food to a new international level. Superb and satisfying!!!!",

Everything tasted fresh and was full of flavor.  They gave this red sauce on the table mixed with onions, tomatoes and I think cilantro and it was a delicious condiment. They also had mayo mixed with garlic and cilantro as well as a mayo and ketchup sauce. The empanadas were lightly fried with a nice crispy outer shell and warm inside of beans and rice. My arepa came in like a pocket pita style wrap covered in foil to keep it warm. It was hot! But a good hot so you know it wasn't sitting around all day. The plantains were were and slightly crispy but more on the chewy side. They get a little tough if you let them sit too long so eat those right away if you order them.   All in this place was wonderful and we really enjoyed everything we had. Also hubby ate the tropical salad with grilled chicken and a pineapple based dressing. Try the Sirobe drink which taste like an Arnold Palmer with extra lime.",

We had a number of the meats, along with the tostones. The tostones were out of this world--crispy, salty, but still had enough body to carry the flavor of the plantains and the many sauce options.  We are so happy to have found this spot! We will definitely be returning again soon (in fact, we grabbed some orders of tostones the next day...), and this will sure to be our new go-to dinner spot.",

    "text": "Really enjoyed my late lunch at the Columbian Spot. It was my first time there, so I tried as many options as possible to get a good idea of what a Columbian restaurant was about.   I knew from walking past it's windows that it's a BYOB restaurant that is popular for empanadas and arepas. I have a Venezuelan friend who had made me homemade arepas before, so I looked forward to trying it here.   Wow. Did I enjoy their menu; so unique in Pittsburgh, I felt a little lost reading thru it- but excited. I was glad to read about their arepa making process on their chalkboard wall and ordered the sirope drink they featured as native to their cuisine.  I tried the beef and chicken empanadas fully expecting to like the beef more, but surprisingly liked the chicken better. I used a lot of their green garlicky sauce and red spicy condiments they had on the table with the salt and pepper. I asked the waitress how to use the condiments as I wasn't sure.   I wanted to try their guacamole-- because I love guacamole. They serve it with fried plantain chips and to be honest, I prefer tortilla chips better. Glad I tried it though. The sirope was good too, not too sweet, very refreshing  with a cinnamon kick.   I could have called it done with just the empanadas but had to try the arepas-- just in case I never go back.   Their arepa menu reads a lot like a Columbian themed sandwich board as they can fill their arepas with pretty much anything.   Because I had the meaty empanadas, I went with their version of a Columbian grilled cheese sandwich- arepa de queso, it was very very good, especially with their red pepper sauce. The arepas are delicious. I ordered the sweet plaintains as my side and could have made a meal out of them alone. So good. I realized after a few bites how filling their corn based empanadas and arepas are and had to throw in the towel.   I would definitely go back to the Columbian spot and do a deeper dive into their menu. I saw a pork belly arepa and a cool dinner menu of native dishes that looked good enough to eat ;))",

The chicken was so so dry, it was very hard to eat.  The flavors and the mushroom sauce were good, but that can't save dry chicken.  My husband ordered the Bandeja Paisa.  The chorizo and plantains were good, but once again, the rest of the meat was so dry it was nearly inedible.   I'd love to comment on the desserts, but after asking for and receiving dessert menus, our server brought us all our checks without actually taking a dessert order. She seemed fairly annoyed with us throughout the evening.  I'm not sure if it was our large party size, or she was just having a bad day.   Also, they had 2 plastic pitchers of waters and plastic cup on the table.  This was not sufficient for 10 people to keep hydrated throughout the evening since the water pitchers were 80% ice.  It was nearly impossible to flag down our server to get more water.   Overall, I thought the food was okay, and the service was acceptable.  I don't really have any desire to go back though.",

    "text": "A small cute stall in the Pittsburgh Public market selling tasty and authentic Colombian food at very reasonable places. I only sampled chicken and beef empanadas here, but I wish I could have tasted some of their other dishes too. I was only exploring the public market and did not have an appetite for a full course meal, but the dishes people were digging into looked really impressive.  The empanadas were $1.50 each and mid-sized but really tasty - the fingerlicking good variety. They also came in a cute little basket. Wait, it gets better...there were 4 wonderful sauces you could help  yourself to. I particularly liked the one called 'pink sauce'.  The only problem I see here is the limited amount of seating. I understand it's part of a public market, but with the great food this place serves, I'd imagine seating could soon become an issue.",

You will be greatly surprised of how much variety and complex flavors this place can develop. It is one of the best dive-ins for colombian flavors. Ask for their specials - bandeja paisas and sancochos are the best. Arepas and Empanadas are made from scratch!!!! This places really takes colombian flavors to a different level. I met the owner-chef while i was there, really really friendly guy and will take care of you for sure!!! I can see this place really taking off in a few years!!!! If you are colombian, you will understand what im talking about, if you are not, then be prepared for one of the best creolle-culinary experiences of the northeast! Enjoy!!!!",

Apps are great too, such as the tostones w/ beans and the empanadas which are on the small side but delish and reasonably priced. Sweet plantains are Cooked to perfection. Their chicken w/ mushroom sauce is packed w/ flavor and a lighter option to the heavy Arepas. They have traditional Columbian drinks that are so refreshing on a sweltering pgh day. Best part, everything I mentioned is Gluten Free, as well as 90 percent of their menu.",

Our waiter was very attentive and gave us suggestions on ordering. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that they surprisingly did not have a side of rice and beans. While they did have Arepas, empanadas and their traditional Bandeja Paisa, I wish they had the option of just chicken, rice and beans, and maybe guacamole? I ordered the Arepa as well and it was delicious! Just wish there was more of selection of simple dishes with a Hispanic twist. The place is also BYOB. While I personally didn't bring anything to drink, there is a beer store across the street and saw other customers with their own drinks. Highly recommend!",
