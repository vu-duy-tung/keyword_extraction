My only complaint is that they were incredibly stingy on the ranch/blue cheese and celery.  I bought 26 wings and got ONE tiny cup and a half a handful of celery for all of them. REALLY?  Why even ask if I wanted any. Regardless, I would go back for more wings (I'll bring my own dip) and would like to try the subs and gyros as long as they use actual tzatziki sauce and not sour cream",

Soo many flavors, which are all tremendous btw. But my personal favorites are the \"Walk\" and \"Talk of Beaver Falls; if you want a milder garlicky version, try their \"Pookie\"! When I moved to the Green tree area, I saw the Carnegie BSBs area opened their doors...yep you can say one happy girl!! Now I'm even MORE impressed with their new location & that they are selling the wings like the other locations! BSBs Carnegie is a must try for sure - especially if you love variety.",

    "text": "This place is close to our house and I've been wanting to try for awhile, so called and ordered an order for pick up. Waited the allotted 45 minutes before stopping in to pick up but the order was still not ready. It was a Sunday during football season so I understand being backed up, but we waited an additional 10 minutes for our order. I ordered an order of 13 wings, 6 wings, and a large fry and the total came to $28 which is pretty pricey for wings in my opinion, but whatever. Got home only to find the fries were not in my bag. I called the restaurant to let them know they forgot my fries and they said I could either come back for them or they could credit my card. Not wanting to go back out again I asked them to just credit my card for the $5 difference for the fries. A few days later I check my statement and the card was not credited, I was charged the whole $28. I'm already annoyed and it's not worth another call and explanation over a $5 charge, but still it's just an annoying experience especially being my first time patronizing the restaurant. The bright spot was that the wings were very good and they have a lot of flavor options, but the mismanagement of order time, correctness of order, and fixing errors to the order soured my first experience and not sure that I will give them another try.   Also parking is difficult, save yourself the trouble and just have it delivered.",

I am always shocked when I get delivery and wings are still crispy. I love the Ace Boogie flavor. If you're going to go here more than once I suggest you take a menu and start crossing flavors off you don't like. I think there are over 50 flavors of wings and they add new ones too.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I really enjoy wings. We are always looking for an excellent go to wing's restaurant.  The restaurant is easy to find. The parking isn't great but it's more of a pick up restaurant than a sit down.   The options of flavors = tremendous! There are so many options to pick from and I want to try them all. We order 19 wings with fries.  We ordered the wings over the fries . I didn't really like that because the fries are soggy to me but my boyfriend lovedddd it. It is definitely worth a try! Don't get me wrong , it's good, just not for me.  The wings were crispy and hot! They were made while we were there. They do take about 20 minutes to make so call ahead and they will be ready!   Over all, we will return. The sauces were great and there was so much over flow to dip them in. But the sauce does not make the wings soggy at all! They are still super crispy and good !",

There was no dressing for the salad and there was barley anything in or on it. The wings where over cooked and cold and the fires ice cold and soggy.",

When we called in, ordered and asked for delivery we were told it would be one hour and a half because they were busy. That's crazy. So I took time away from my guests and went to get them (35 minutes later).  Wings were just okay, a bit on the tough side. The Parmesan ones we ordered had a heavy cream sauce on them that I couldn't identify as Parmesan. Plus no blue cheese comes with your order. We were disappointed overall and will try elsewhere next time.",

Then I get an answer but the man on the phone sounds very irritated as if he hates his job. I got attitude just for ordering food. They can't take credit cards half the time they say they card machine is down. They must not have good help or none at all. The wait time for delivery is horrible. I hope they stay open simply because I do love the selection of wing flavors but they really need to get either more or better staff members.",

The Black and Gold are quite possibly the best wings I've ever not grilled myself - deep fried perfection, dipped in some crazy bbq sauce and rolled in a delicious cayenne mix dry seasoning.  The Napoleon Garlic were too plain for me, but a totally traditional garlic flavor if you're into that.   I wish I could have tried more. 150 flavors is INSANE. The staff was super chill and had great suggestions.   If I ever come back to Pittsburgh, I'm coming here first thing.",

Will give it one more shot, but very disappointed.",

Fries were old and mushy, order was wrong. If you're allergic to something and ask them not to put it on, they will.... It's like they have no care for your allergy. Sandwiches were dry, that's probably why the gallon of mayo they put on it after you ask for lite mayo.. wings were so over fried, almost broke a tooth.....Expensive lesson learned.",

I tried,  probably 10 times over the phone, to explain my order to the cashier.  Two orders of wings and a side of fries.  What I got was one order of wings on a bed of fries.  The worst part of the experience was while I'm waiting for the manager to fix the order, the cashier disappeared to get another customer a cup of mayo.  He then returns with the cup of mayo and mayo all over the side of his mouth!!!  .  This was the second time i was here and the first time was not much better.",

( did a very large order tho) Tried again more recently and got the house special flavor, (Bob's Original?) and they were darn good ! Everything else is also good, nothing outstanding but then what can you do with wings? I've seldom had truly bad wings, just some are better than others.  (I like wings) a general coment.... Wings here in western PA seem a bit expensive and a little on the small side , usually about a buck each + or-  and BOBs prices are about the same as anywhere around,.  Just wings are generally more expensive here than what I am used to,  that's OK tho. . . eating out here is generally less expensive.  especially breakfast. Go Figure!",
