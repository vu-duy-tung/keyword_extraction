My date and I loved our evening at this beautiful, tastefully-decorated, comfortable restaurant.  We were immediately seated in a lovely booth as we requested per our reservation, a vantage point from which we could both see the entire dining room.  Everything we ordered was delicious: my potent martini, my lady's glasses of Chardonnay, my Atria's salad, her chopped salad, her chicken marsala, my chicken parmigiana (three large cutlets layered with cheese and sprinkled with parsley flakes), an artistically-presented slice of Limoncello cake with raspberry sauce drizzled around it that we shared.  The gracious, attentive service from young Andrew did a great deal to enhance our delicious food.  It was truly service with a smile.  He made us feel like king and queen.  Atria's provided us with a memorable evening!",

We weren't too hungry so we both ordered greek salads and soup. He had the cheese soup and I had the lobster bisque soup. The bisque was too salty for me and i tasted very little crab. There was maybe a sliver of real crab meat in the soup. The cheese soup had a milder flavor but was pleasant and not too overpowering.  Our salads were presented very nicely with pita bread circled around the outside of the dish. The salad was not bad except that the dressing for me was too acidic. My cheek started to hurt every time I took a bite. Maybe the salt from the bisque mad my cheeks raw therefore causing the painful reaction.IDK.   I  am willing to give this place another try since I did not try any of there entrees. Hopefully they will be more pleasing to my mouth.",

I've sent back a restaurant item probably twice in the past 10 years.   In this case, a Bloody Mary was ordered by my date and it was way too spicy.   She asked for a glass of chardonnay to replace the drink, and that went just fine.  Before they rang up the bill I added $125 in gift cards/certificates to the order.   When the bill arrived, the $6 Bloody Mary had been replaced by a $14 chardonnay.  In fairness, we did not specify the wine brand, but it feels like a case of the house \"getting even\" for sending back a drink.  My date's meal was only $18 and we certainly would not have ordered a $14 wine.     So...we asked for a replacement drink, but did not specify a brand, and the drink was replaced with a premium brand wine.  Nope, was not going to make a scene, but it left a bad \"taste\"...and $125 in gift cards and certificates.",

My boyfriend got a burger which was good (though greasy), and I got one of the Oktoberfest offerings which was basically an egg sandwich and was ok but a small portion for the price.  The sides were both horrible. Soggy, limp, lukewarm, unseasoned fries. My boyfriend joked that maybe they just reheated them from the night before. The German potato salad that came with mine was basically just a few slices of potato in a ramekin with some liquid in the bottom that I guess was a dressing but looked and tasted bad. There were a few limp onion pieces on the first slice of potato but none to be found underneath. It was honestly gross.   Decor was nice, service was pleasant but a bit slow considering there were only a few tables seated, but we won't be back on account of the food.",

The side of smoked gouda mac 'n cheese was rich, but a little on the runny side for my taste. The pot roast nachos are allegedly \"famous,\" but something was off -- a lackluster attempt of melted cheese, imbalanced proportions, and/or just not my favorite pot roast rendition. However, it's hard to complain when you ask what Dublin coddle is on the St. Patty's Day inspired menu and the server brings out a small bowl to sample (on the house). It definitely lived up to our server's hype...SOUP, there it is! Overall, Atria's delivers consistently good comfort food, but I expect a little more flair at that price point.",

The service was incredible.  The bartender Dan was great. It was happy hour so we got half priced apps and drink specials.  The food was AMAZING. We had the ahi tuna appetizer, Fra Diabla pasta and the BBQ Pork Gorgonzola. Seriously amazing. To top it off the manager gave us a free dessert!  Definitely try this place. We will make this a regular stop!  The wife and I stopped in again for a late lunch. We were yet again really impressed with the service and the quality of the food. They really treat you like family there. We were given free nachos as an appetizer and then ordered the Ahi Tuna Quinoa bowl and the honey orange salmon. The food was just incredible. So far this place is 2 for 2.  It is quickly becoming our go-to place!",

Pretzels with mustard - 5 stars - my husband said that the pretzels were the best-tasting that he has ever eaten. Salmon salad - 3 stars - lettuce, strawberries, cheese, and almonds were fresh, but the salmon could have tasted better. Chicken parmesan - 3 stars - my husband said that it tasted just OK. Service - 3 stars - employees were polite but a little slow.",

    "text": "This restaurant has just come off my list of local places to go. Had lunch there today; their Mediterranean Chicken Quinoa bowl. Started with the chicken and quinoa, saving the broccoli for last. First couple bites were ok, then I felt a grittiness when I chewed. Drank my beverage until the grittiness was gone, then carefully speared a piece of broccoli and chewed. Again, the grittiness, a bit worse this time. When the server came by, I mentioned the problem. She said she would check with the kitchen and offered me new vegetables. I declined. When she returned, the server relayed that the kitchen said they washed the broccoli and I must be mistaking the texture of the quinoa for grit. Huh? I've been cooking for 40 years and eating longer. I know what grit from unwashed food feels like, and it does not feel like cooked quinoa. And when the check came, there was no discount, and no manager came to speak with me. I left nauseated and angry; too many other good choices nearby to ever come here again.",

However, that's where it ends.  1st they promote free draft with Father's Day Weekend Feature.  See attached photo.  But they don't honor it.  They say it's only good on Father's Day.  But there's nothing on the feature menu that says that.   Then they ran out of bread.  I ordered a salad.  All they had was butter.  Apparently there was an event where they ran out of bread.  Really?  Did you just find out about that?  Going down hill.",

They were out of quite a few things, including asparagus and broccoli, which essentially meant there was no vegetable option. That was quite disappointing. They were out of one of the featured dishes, the jagerschnitzel. The potato pancakes came out cold and tough.   The menu was pretty basic, nothing spectacular. The food was okay, but nothing I can't get for less somewhere else.   My husband had the chicken pot pie, and ended up very sick later that night. We'd eaten the same foods throughout the day except for this dinner. We won't be back.",

We got our order in no time flat and I was amazed when I saw those homemade chips! I was told I had ordered the most popular dish on the menu and it didn't disappoint.

I've also been to many private  dinner parties there where a private room is booked and those have been good overall. I enjoy the chicken picatta from the menu and the interesting butter types that come with your complementary bread before your meal.

Today discovered that vegans better beware if you order a salad as it comes loaded with eggs, cheese, bacon and croutons. Its like a club sandwich in a bowl more than a salad. The SO said the bacon was like little pebbles. The fish sandwich was frozen and then flash fried so the crust was very hard, but the inside was mush and flavorless. Note to chef : If you are going to use frozen fish, at least thaw it out before attempting to cook it. It came out plated without garnish, a pickle , nothing, even minus my fries. it looked so lonely! Lol. We  returned it and went up the street to nox's tavern in blawnox for a delicious cod sandwich done right with fabulous onion rings. It put Atrias effort to shame. The bill at atrias was 38 dollars for two iced teas, two pebble 'salads' and one entree. Definitely not worth it. Crowd very small for both recent visits, one friday afternoon lunch only  two tables seated, and tonight, a Thursday, maybe five. No one came in after us at 730.  Waitress diffident and disappeared. On a downhill course and picking up speed. A far cry from its early days.  Needs a new chef and a more inventive menu.",

I never expected to see two sauces poured on a single dish ... this restaurant is an insult to the very cuisine they claim to be an expert in.  Reminds me of the last line of Goodfellas ... \"everything tastes like ketchup\" .. sorry I don't have a picture to show you how gross their signature dish really is.

I could eat the chopped salad (with at least a dozen vegetables in it) daily.  My friend is not adventurous with food.  She likes salmon.  I tried influence her ordering (my favorite miso salmon with vegetables) ... she ordered the salmon salad with strawberries.  She enjoyed the meal and said she would order again.

They have a pretty broad menu, with several entree salads, sandwiches, some pasta, mean, and seafood dishes, plus several starters.  When they have the chili, it's great, with some good meat and lots of flavor.  I usually have one of the entree salads, which are plenty for a meal, but are on the pricey side (about $15).
