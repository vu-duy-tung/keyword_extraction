Never in my life have I seen wood fired pizza burnt on the bottom. How? Did the pizza maker just forget how to do his job yinz pay him for? Then they didn't even cut ether of them . I wanna know who looked at this damn pizza and said , hell ya brother that's a good pie don't even cut it . Hopefully this was a fluke or something but no I don't want a refund and no I don't want a discount or credit next time yinz lost my business. It's sad to see a waste and of course I still ate them I was hungry when I ordered them now I'm just full and mad .",

    "text": "I stopped by for dinner during the Grand Opening event with a friend. We waited in line for over an hour. The staff were friendly and the line moved efficiently.  I ordered a build-your-own pizza with ancient grain dough, red sauce, fresh mozzarella, my favorite toppings, basil, and balsamic glaze. I like the many different choices, and the ingredients all looked very fresh. There really isn't anything like pizza fresh from the oven! My only gripes about the food are that the baking times seem a little inconsistent--my friend's crust was heavenly while mine tasted a little too crispy and burnt--and there were a couple flies buzzing around. I understand that the windows and door were wide open, but it was still a little off-putting to see a fly landing on pizza dough.  There are a few tables inside and several counter seats. There are garage door windows along the storefront, Pitt-themed images, and a TV. A nice, casual atmosphere to hang out with some friends.  Overall, I had a good experience. The pizza was yummy, but it's a little pricey. This is the type of place I'd take my parents, but probably not one I'll frequent regularly. Nevertheless, it's a great addition to Oakland!",

They offer white or wheat pizza dough (also gluten free for $2 extra) and about 5 sauces to pick from. I went with the white pizza dough with red sauce.  Next up you get your choice of  cheese plus 5 toppings including 1 protein. They have pepperoni, chicken, and Italian sausage plus more to pick from. I wanted to do veggie so loaded up on green peppers, pineapple, banana peppers, olives and onions.  I also went with the shredded mozzarella and the pizza was so cheesy! They are generous with the portions and the pizza bakes quickly.  Once the pizza is done you can get it to go or eat there (a nice amount of seating). Don't forget to get any sauces or extras like oregano, basil and many dressings. My pizza was complete with a side of ranch. This all took less than 10 minutes and the cost is $7.99 plus tax.  A great stop for lunch!",

    "text": "I've tried this place twice and, although there are a few kinks to work out, I hope it will be a regular part of my lunch rotation.   The first time I ate here was an evening just a few days after they opened. I customized a bianco pizza and it was delicious--albeit a little light on toppings. The only problem was that the oven wasn't working properly and--the promise of having your pizza cooked in 150 seconds--took more than 15 minutes. Luckily, I wasn't in a hurry. Although, because of the oven issue, they did stop accepting orders and were turning people away at the door after I got my order.  I returned after the lunch rush a week or two later and speed wasn't an issue. However, the person making my same custom white pizza put entirely too much cheese and garlic on the pie. So much that it was incredibly greasy and the crust could not support the weight of the toppings--making it rather difficult to eat. No only that, but there were big clumps of garlic that crunched when biting into a slice. Yet another problem was that the outer edges of crust were burnt to a nearly ash-like consistency. So, needless to say, my second pizza wasn't nearly as good as the first.  I'm optimistic that the opening kinks will get worked out soon and am crossing my fingers that my third visit is a charm with just the right amount of toppings on a properly cooked crust. In the meantime, my opinion is that this place is worth trying. You may just want to have a plan B should the line be too long or the oven not working properly.  As for the price, if the quality issues get worked out, I think it's fairly reasonable. It would be nice though if you could add a small drink and walk out for under $10.",

And I can imagine eating there after I use my second coupon. It seems like a better deal than Piada across the street.   Thanks, Sheila.  My only suggestion is that you start carrying San Pellegrino.

    "text": "I was eager for this pizza place to open up as it didn't look like the typical Oakland food.  Taste-wise, the pizza was great.  I got a Hawaiian pizza which was about par with most Hawaiian pizzas I've had.  However, the staff making the pizza were so quiet, and would not speak up even after asking.  The process of 'build your own pizza' was not well-defined and only made it more difficult that you could not hear the staff.  The woman at the cashier hardly spoke.  She didn't reply to most questions and acknowledged in grunts.  The atmosphere was well decorated.  The line moved pretty quickly.  However, it was about 90 degrees and muggy that day, and the restaurant had the front garage door windows open to the outside.  The air must not have been on as well, so it felt about 90 degrees inside and muggy.  The pizza oven added to the heat as well.  All the staff were visibly sweating on their foreheads which made you wonder if their hands were clean if they were wiping brows.  It was too unbearably hot inside, so I chose to eat somewhere else.  I would gladly go back if the staff attitudes changed and they did something about the temperature.  However, the pizza is priced moderately high, so will not go often if at all.",

Fresh ingredients, clean restaurant, fair prices, friendly staff and good food. I wish they had more beverage selections like slushies instead of only having fountain drinks but it was a rough day so I think vodka was my beverage of choice at the time. I will go back and try other menu items like the salads and building my own pizza when I'm in the area. Parking is a bit of a challenge but I recommend garage parking to ease the pain.

However....whoever took it out of the oven mangled it (and apparently thought it was OK to give to a customer!!). The end line worker (very nice) looked at it and order another one. I looked over and noticed it was mine. Having limited time, I was really upset that this happened (I know; no one is perfect, but...) They made me another one. Yes, I was parked at a meter. I added more time to accommodate the additional wait time. I also had originally had red and spicy red sauce on the pizza. The one I got was only red. The same woman apologized. No manager. No credit to come back. Just more wait time and more money on my meter.   I'll give them the growing pains clause and forgive. The pizza was good-not great. But, I'll try them one more time.

    "text": "Came in with the grand opening crowd, who stood in a line that stretched a good distance down the block an hour from closing time (past the Chipotle). It moved pretty fast though, about a 20 minute wait, so that is probably a good sign for how this place is meant to be fast casual / takeout. The BYO fast-fired pizza type of pipeline seems to be pretty popular nowadays, and the way that Lotsa does is similar to other places--you pick a dough base, sauce, a number of toppings, and then they fire it up for you, ready to be eaten in about a minute or two. There are also suggested combinations, though the BYO is probably what most people will end up doing.   I am tempted to compare this place relative to Blaze Pizza, since that is the chain that I've frequented most and really enjoy. In that sense, Lotsa is more expensive and also more frugal on the toppings. While Blaze gives you unlimited toppings, Lotsa limits you to five and charges you for anything after that. One good thing is that Lotsa has some interesting choices not really found anywhere else, like anchovies. As mentioned though, I would hope that they are more generous with them; my pizza ended up with a rather large and dry crust portion that was devoid of both sauce and toppings, which wasn't entirely pleasant to eat. If I were paying regular price, I'd expect a better tasting pizza.   That said, I'm sure they'll work out some of these kinks after opening day, so I look forward to coming in to try their pizzas again .",

I like the variety--choose your own crust, sauce, cheese, toppings--while also providing the predesigned options. There also gluten-free crust. Basically same concept as V3 but I found this to be tastier and more filling. I got the BBQ chicken pizza and was told I could add additional toppings so I did! It was made quickly. I sat at the opened area that faces outside which was great in the nice weather. I just love the crispy crust!! It didn't *blow me away* but it's a great addition to a college town. Overall, I really enjoyed it..I probably won't do the BBQ again but will go back to try something else!",

I personally don't think the size of the pizza is worth that much money. There are $2 off late nights but even still over $7 is a little much :/  Because of the price I won't come here again anytime soon, which is why I'll rate this place a 3, but the pizza did taste pretty good :)",

I tried the Bianca which was pretty good except for the fact that mine just had a lot of ricotta cheese that kept sliding off. This chain appears to seek out and flourish on college campuses. I thought it was really cool how they dedicated an entire wall to Pitt with photos of the Cathedral and panther. I do agree with other reviewers that $8.99 doesn't really seem worth it for the size of the pie. Nonetheless, seeing as though I live nearby, I'll definitely be back for a late night craving. Not many places are open as late (3 am) which is also a really nice perk of this place. You'd think there would be more late night bites in Oakland. Who knows? Maybe Lotsa will change the game.",

The service is pretty subpar though, it seems to be mostly college students so my pizza was a bit sloppy (might have been because one new employee or something), and she didn't add basil to my margherita pizza so it ended up being all cheese and a few tomatoes... I wanted pesto as a topping and there seemed to be miscommunication about who was going to help me as well. The employee also didn't ask what I wanted while I was making my way down the ingredients - I would add way more toppings next time.",

First, you get a sizable pizza with FIVE toppings included, yes FIVE who honestly needs more than that to create a delicious combination. Second, the lines are long but the service is quite fast, about the pace of a Chipotle, if you will. Third, the pizza is delicious. Now some people are not a fan of a thinner crust but I honestly did not feel the crust was lacking. I can't speak to the taste of their signature pizzas but I built my own with Italian sausage, chicken, bacon, fresh mozzarella, and spinach  with basil and balsamic and my mind was blown. Now I will say the price point is just under $10 for a personal pizza which is not bad, but not great, but outside of that I have little to complain about. There is friendly service and ample seating to top off a solid taste experience. I definitely believe it is worth your time!",

Overall not terrible. But not what I would have expected for a stone fired pizza restaurant.   I also ordered from UBEReats and was not surprised by there crappy service, but a little disappointed that the restaurant didn't send any utensils along with the driver.

Will surely order again, especially when I'm near the actual store... so I can actually tip them.  Tip: one pizza is not gonna feed two people. You should probably pool together at least $20, especially if one or both of you are drunk.",

It's a fair sized pizza at a reasonable price, open VERY late, and totally customizable (and who doesn't love the Chipotle model?) They also offer some pretty unique toppings, like Roasted Garlic and Fresh Basil, as well as the option for wheat or gluten-free crust. We went after a Museum After Dark event, and were glad to have an option other than Subway. I recommend choosing ricotta as the cheese, if you don't mind a less traditional cheese option.",

Yeah so i bought this cookie with toffee and pretzels in it - omg amazing. So i ordered a Bianca plus spinach, and garlic bread. I agree with other reviews that it was all somehow bland, and burnt so it tasted really off. I love pizza. I love dough, usually eat all my crusts. These, i basically ate around the crust. And the garlic bread is a pizza flat maybe with something on it? Just tasted bad burnt, with lots of little cloves of garlic. I would probably sautee the garlic a bit more, make a sauce or oil with some salt.. Maybe better with cheese? Tried with the marinara - WORSE! Ranch - meh- probably all from GFS like the croutons.  So maybe the oven was too hot, i did go at a slower time. Might go back for that cookie - (packaged for resale) Sorry no pics. Ravenous!",

All of us ended up going with the build your own style. I got the classic pizza dough, buffalo sauce, mozzarella, blue cheese, spinach, red onion, olives,bell pepper, and a ranch drizzle.   The pizza was made pretty quickly. I am a fan of their dough, which is nice and light. I was disappointed that their buffalo sauce was very mild. I was expecting more of a kick. The toppings are pretty standard. For $8.99, it is a decent sized pizza. Overall, not a bad place if you want to build your own pizza.

I ordered a BBQ Chicken pizza but while I was in line after putting in my order, the workers were talking to me as if I was building my own pizza so I was confused... and I noticed that the cheddar jack wasn't put on my pizza when it's included on a BBQ chicken pizza... I'm not sure if it's because it was the grand opening and it was really busy so the workers were hectic getting in everyone's orders... but I was disappointed that they couldn't get the specialty pizza order right. It took about 2 minutes for the pizza to cook in the oven which was pretty impressive.   I would say that for the size of the pizza, $8.99 is not worth it. Also, one of my friend's pizza wasn't even cut when she received it.

    "text": "I really enjoyed Lotsa Stone Fired Pizza. I was most impressed with the flavor of the crust-- it was delicious. The sauce could have used a little more salt, but that was my only complaint. Love that they have fresh mozzarella as well!   This will definitely be added to my Oakland rotation!   Street parking available, but can be hard to find.   Service was solid, as everyone was very kind.",

    "text": "Came here for the Grand Opening! The line was crazy long, we waited for probably at least an hour and a half. The special was $3.99 for a \"BYO\" - Build Your Own Pizza. It's a personal pizza with your choice of sauce, cheese, up to 5 toppings (after which are extra), and then a few choices to top your pizza with.  It was pretty good. I got a BBQ sauce pizza with chicken, bacon, red onions, pineapple, and spinach, with BBQ sauce on top. For $3.99; I thought this deal was totally worth it and a total steal. I throughly enjoyed this Grand Opening Event. However, I don't think I'd be willing to spend $8.99 on the same pizza. I understand that they use fresh ingredients and everything is prepared and made right in front of you, so that's more costly. Of course. But on a college student budget, I could use that and get a large carry out pizza from a different chain that will feed me for multiple meals.  Delicious and fresh pizza; but a little too costly for me.",

    "text": "Affordable, generous, and delectable. I was skeptical both trying Lotsa - especially growing up with such easy access to classic New York slices and Sicilian pies, but Lotsa has lots going for them. The portions are personalized, the price is right, the environment if relaxed and friendly, and the pizza itself is 5 star material. If I was never not drunk enough to recall the taste of a Sorrentos slice, I'd say this place is almost just as good!",

    "text": "Such a wonderful establishment. The restaurant and decor are clean and modern. Easy to order with much variety in combinations. Amazing flavors! The dough is delicious! The staff was friendly and inviting. One may have even been the owner as he took extremely good care of us and even chatted with us for 15-20 minutes after our meal as we were trying to learn about the area. I will be back! Probably visit the South Side location at their Grand Opening this upcoming Thursday. Thank you Anthony and Lotsa!",

    "text": "What a disgrace. This is the worst build-your-own pizza joint I have ever visited. First of all, the toppings here are not unlimited, unlike at Blaze or Pieology, so cost-wise, it makes no sense to come here.   In terms of the quality of the food, they use way too much cornmeal, so the pizza crust has a jarring texture. To add, the workers flatten the pizza dough by hand, which does not work when the pizzas are fast-casual because the dough cannot cook evenly in their oven. There were parts of the pizza that were undercooked and doughy that still imparted an unpleasant and rugged texture to the tongue due to the excessive coating of cornmeal.  The topping options here are limited in terms of available offerings as well as cost. They did not appear to be that fresh anyway.  Lotsa is in a prime location in Oakland and while the space is nice (I like the big garage-style windows), yet food is terrible enough to keep me away.",

    "text": "This was my first time here and I came during Oakland Restaurant Week.   It was crowded, as I expected, for lunch. It's on a college campus so I would advise to keep that in mind if you want to avoid lines or order ahead.  I got the margarita pizza. It was the special that day. The crust was crispy. The pizza was preset but I did finish with balsamic glaze. It was tasty. The flavors were as expected.   I have some other places that were a similar concept and honestly preferred them. Here, you can't get unlimited toppings and their finishes are limited. The other places are also less expensive.   For a lunch with coworkers, I'd come back.",
