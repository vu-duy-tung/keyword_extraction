The food is clean and pretty much everything other than the chimichangas can be made in a healthy manner. Mad Mex is conscientious of and caters to all diets and allergies. As a vegetarian, I have always been able to enjoy a healthy, filling, delicious meal. There are numerous options, and they will modify everything to accommodate your dietary needs. The portions are generous, so you can enjoy leftovers the next day. The salsa is made fresh daily, and you can taste the difference. Someone posted negative comments about their sour cream. It is pure sour cream without the chemicals and preservatives you're served elsewhere, so if you don't like it, you probably don't truly like sour cream. If you want fresh, spicy, delicious food, with a fun atmosphere and an alternating array of craft brews, you'll love Mad Mex!",

    "text": "This update is in regards to Mad Mex at the Robinson Township location, specifically going with a larger group of people:  I most frequently visit Mad Mex at this location and being that it is at the crux of roads between where I live and other family lives, I have gone here a few times with a bigger group of guests. After my most recent visit I would not suggest that is a good plan.  The most recent visit with a group was on a mid-weekday night with no special game playing on the screens. However, the place was really packed. Our plans had been completely last minute, so we didn't get to call in a reservation. We were told the wait would be 20-25 minutes; we waited about 50 to an hour to get seated. Service does take longer for big groups but it was so slow about 2 hours passed from when we were seated to when we were able to pay the check and go. The evening included our server who spilled the whole tray of drinks on our table (hey, it happens) and who eventually became either so stressed or annoyed that she didn't tend to our table for long periods of time and when she did so she was not very polite.  Another warning for going with larger groups is in regards to ordering dessert. We had a few kids with our group and so ordered the brownie a la mode and a couple of ice cream burritos. All of the ice cream was melted for all three dishes when it arrived. It was as unappealing as it sounds (think: soupy cream burrito) but we were all so eager to leave that we didn't bother to mention it. Melted ice cream at restaurants usually happens if the plates come straight from the hot wash or--as it appeared in our case being that the plates weren't hot--the server waited too long to pick up the dessert after ordering it through the P.O.S.  I can most accurately describe the entire experience that evening as arduous. Though I enjoyed the guests that I went with--this time being my family--the atmosphere of stress and negativity was set by the service and pacing of the meal. I was quite relieved when we left and was wishing in hindsight that we had gone anywhere else. It will be awhile before I can go back again, but it definitely won't be with a group of more than four.",

The service is always excellent and it has more of a restaurant feel than the other locations that are more bar oriented. The cranberry margarita flavor they've add for November is very good if you like a sweeter margarita. The Fajita Burrita was also great with some added queso inside. The one thing I wouldn't recommend is  nacho appetizer as all the toppings are piled on top with nothing on the chips underneath.",

    "text": "Since I hadn't been to this Mexican chain before, I decided to give it a shot. My girlfriend and I decided to try lunch at Mad Mex since we both love Mexican food and are always open to trying new places. This one however, will not see us again most likely, unless we want to try some drinks. We started with chips and salsa, after seeing another table with the same. What we hadn't seen prior to ordering was the prepared state of the salsa. It looked more like tomato salad, as it had none of the juice of any of the ingredients. The flavor was good, but it was very dry; not what you anticipate when having salsa. From there, we both ordered burritos. The Mad Mex signature for her, and the wing burrito for myself. I had expected a decently sized burrito along with some sort of side, like rice or beans. Instead, I got a plate-sized rectangular burrito, with a questionable sauce topped on, and a small bit of lettuce and more of the salsa (really making it look like salsa salad now). To my surprise, the sides I was expecting were in the burrito. Rice and beans throughout, and, except for the meat (which I might add was added very sparingly), there was nothing else to my burrito. While filling, the burrito held a flavor which did not really kick in, despite asking for the hot wing sauce when ordered. After smothering it in hot sauce from the table, it was better, but only as good as a rice and bean burrito can really be. I have no problem with a vegetarian meal as such, but I would've liked to be told before ordering it. Overall, the food wasn't overpriced and the service was decent, but I also didn't get much of what I wanted either. Maybe we ordered the wrong things, and this place is truly great underneath it all. However, the chances of returning, especially with other great Mexican meals at Taco Bell and Plaza Azteca looming nearby, are very slim to none. Thanks for trying, but I'd rather not try it again, Mad Mex. Adios!",

I met up with my father who was staying close to the airport overnight, and I actually had a bit of trouble finding the place (it's cryptically hidden facing the highway on the first floor of an office building. Once I found the parking lot, though, it was smooth sailing, good company, and good food. One thing I will complain about, which happens at every Mad Mex location, is they put small tables incredibly close to other tables- which means that you're essentially immersed in both of your neighboring tables' conversations (and vise versa). However, the food was really great- I had a taco salad and they allowed me to substitute the beef for tofu (which was above par). The waitress was incredible, not even considering that it was a crazy busy Friday night. I probably won't eat there again because I live closer to the Oakland and Shadyside locations, but I definitely recommend it.",

I love that this location has the same happy hour specials as Oakland (see below), but without the crowds and the long wait times... AND this location is about 4x the size of Oakland... all-in-all, it's just great... 5 stars!!  Specials: Weekdays from 5 - 7 - $7 big azz margaritas (they really are HUGE) - $3 for 12oz margaritas - $5 for 16oz margaritas - Half off all drafts and wings  Everyone night from 10 - midnight - $7 big azz margaritas   p.s. try the blue cornbread!!",

    "text": "We met some friends here on our way into Pittsburgh on a Thursday night and man, we were impressed! None of us had ever eaten here before, but we all want to go back! Only 20 minutes from downtown in the Robinson Towne Center: a welcoming, fun atmosphere.  I don't know if it's the preferred place to bring children because it has more of a loud bar atmosphere, but it's great if you're looking to meet friends and you don't mind the noise level. I noticed it became louder while we were there (6-8pm) and it did cater to a boisterous happy hour crowd. I can see how this place would do very very well near a college campus (several locations are near colleges). It just feels very trendy, a little hipster, and someplace that the bar crowd would feel right at home.  But let's get to the food! I was shocked that chips and salsa didn't come with our meal automatically: this is officially the first American-Mexican restaurant I've ever been to that didn't serve chips and salsa right off the bad. We did order some and they were tasty. The Pennsyltucky fried tofu was delicious and I highly recommend it to start as your appetizer.  So what's your pleasure? Enchiladas, burritos, fajitas, chimichangas: if the patrons at my table were of any authority, then it's all great! It sounds like you can modify just about anything, so talk to your server. Speaking of servers, the customer service was great and that in itself can make or break a dining experience for me.  By the way, I was so excited to find that there is a Mad Mex in Columbus, which is where I live. Excuse me, I have to go there NOW. If it's anything like the Robinson location, then I'll be a regular as much as I can be.",

He got the BBQ flavor and was better and I had the California one that was not good at all. Very odd flavor. Spicy but there was supposed to be some sort of honey hint but you can't taste any sweetness. Also, they are literally a flour taco shell, some lettuce, and a wing on it. No sauce, or slaw, or any other additional flavor level. I only give this place 3 stars because the waffle fries were really good. I would suggest getting anything else if you come here.",

I almost yelped a not so good review last week when we were there, but I didn't thinking they were just having an off day. Tonight was even worse than the last time. Our waitress took an extremely long time to get to us, hardly ever checked in, never brought us napkins (our 5 year old is messy) no straws, the glass that my husband's margarita came in was so disgusting. I'm not OCD about stuff like that but you could clearly see something stuck to many different spots on the inside of the glass.   On a positive note, the food was great as always. I love Mad Mex, but their service makes me not want to go back. :(",

The blend of flavors is divine. The tortillas aren't too flour-y, and the individual flavors meld into one glorious whole. It's not like a standard Mexican place where all the flavors taste separate and you feel like you ate a truck afterwards. They have this thing down. Recommend.",

When I lived in Pittsburgh I ate here at least once a week and the service and food has always been top notch. This location has me very confused. I ordered a salad and asked to omit an ingredient (never has been a problem before) this location refused to accommodate. The waiter was also very argumentative when  I asked questions. I am very sad and needless to say I will not be coming to this location again ...I talked to the manager and he tried to make the situation better so we submitted another order and it came out wrong again .. I think in a nut shell this location has a rude wait staff and a lazy kitchen staff .. Don't let this location sway you from visiting mad Mex my favorite locations are shady side and monroeville :)",

I blame it on my [temporarily] vegetarian diet, and the lack of ingredients in that burrito other than chili. I miss their chicken.  The waitress was unbelievably good.

The decor is a quirky mix of Mexican, with skulls, weirdly designed animals and cacti.  I ordered a cup of tortilla soup and a chicken quesadilla. My spouse ordered a cup of black bean soup and a chicken burrito. My soup was warm and filling. It had chunks of grilled chicken and some shredded cheese on top. It was the perfect texture with just a little kick. My quesadilla was crispy on the outside and filled to the brim with chunks of grilled chicken, onions, green peppers and cheese. The peppers had been roasted which added flavor. The quesadilla comes with salsa and sour cream but I ordered guacamole too. Yum! My husband's black bean soup was a little plain even though it came with a dollop of sour cream. It could have used a bit of spicyness. His burrito had chunks of grilled chicken, rice, and black beans. Unfortunately it was light on the chicken and heavy on the rice and beans. The burrito also comes with salsa.and sour cream but he too, added guacamole.  It was a nice warm meal on a rainy day.",

    "text": "This is by far one of my favorites in the area and it keeps me coming back time and time again. I know it is not authentic Mexican by any means but they have a very interesting spin on Mexican food. My go to is the wing o rito with buffalo sauce. What's not to love when you are mixing buffalo sauce and a burrito together?! With that said there is plenty of other great items on the menu such as a carnitas quesadilla, carnitas burrito, fish tacos, tortilla soup. AND the famous gobblerito that makes an appearance around thanksgiving each year. Personally I wish they had it year round because it's that good. It sounds slightly gross on paper mixing your entire thanksgiving meal up in a burrito but I promise it is good. I will say if you are someone who doesn't like their foods touching then this probably isn't the burrito for you. The salsa is also one of my favorite restaurant salsas. I like that it's not a runny salsa. It is definitely worth paying for in my opinion.  Now on to my favorite item...the margaritas. I'm not sure what they put in these margaritas but let me just say my friends and I don't call them suicide margaritas for no reason. $10 for a big azz margarita may sound like a lot but you will feel good after 1. They also change their specialty flavor each month. They have flavors such as cranberry apple cider, apple cider, watermelon, banana, strawberry banana, and passion fruit just to name a few. At this point I think I've tried them all and they are all amazing. The sangria blur is a personal favorite from the regular menu.   I would also like to comment on the staff that works at this location. Each waiter/waitress that I've had over the years has always been pleasant and very nice. Some of the staff behind the bar have been there for years and you can just tell they love their job. They are always checking on you and asking if you need anything. Lucy and Heath are always being friendly with each of the customers and anytime I go there and don't see them I'm a little bummed. This location is by far my favorite.",

The lunch crowd had emptied just enough for the cool music to float into the room and contribute to a cool vibe. Service was prompt and spot on. The chimi came with a tomato cheese sauce which tasted very similar to vodka sauce. It was a good addition to a plump chimi. My companion said the black beans were tasty, but the rice was too bland. Guacamole was devoured with gusto.  A chopped salad had grilled cauliflower, butternut squash and Brussels sprouts; as well as corn, cherry tomatoes and greens. The ordered skirt steak was done perfectly and was surprisingly tender, given the cut. I would order this again AND again.  My companion was a bit taken back by the tariff, but it seemed on par for this city girl. I would return again and recommend them!",

Let me count the ways: 1. We arrived and we ordered our salsa trio and were given a bowl a broken chips that were so small that it was embarrassing to try to eat them and the salsa. -I had to ask for more chips!!! 2. Then we placed an order... The teenager with me specifically asked if the tacos (fried chicken) where spicy. Numerous times it was asked as well as she asked for no pickles (see below on how that turned out!!) 3. Then somehow our food order got lost... We sat there and waiting for significantly long time probably 30 to 40 minutes... And it was not a busy tonight. Our waitress comes out 30/ 40 minutes later and informs us that somehow our dinner order/ticket had gotten lost and that she was going to have the kitchen quickly remake our food. Our food came out probably another 15/20 minutes later 4. My mahi-mahi fajita was burned to the point it tasted awful (both my friend and the teenager that was with us tasted it and both stated they thought it was burned as well.) 5. In addition the taco (see #2) was spicy and there is pickles on her taco!  I will say kudos that they did take my meal off the ticket... But even when we asked the waitress to split our checks... (As I was going to pay half for the youth and salsa... The waitress even screwed that up! Although the waitress did apologize profusely about our meals being late I have to tell you I was so completely disappointed! I personally feel that after all the mistakes...the meal should have been comped!... I have to say it will be a long time for me  to ever eat at Mad Mex again! Which is truly sad! As I can't tell you how many times I drove from Cleveland to Pittsburgh because we love that restaurant!  Also as an FYI... I knew ahead of time that the menu had changed... And my favorite burrito was no longer on it! And had been to Mad Mex since the menu had changed! So this review was nothing about the menu change but about the food and service! Also as a sidenote the manager never came to our table and apologized!",

I've had very few issues with this restaurant and whatever problems I have had, were fixed immediately. Their menu is great even if you're a vegetarian and they offer a wide variety of food to chose from. I have only ever had one problem with service being subpar, but every other time has been wonderful. They're very attentive despite always being so busy. I would highly recommend Mad Mex if you're looking for a relaxing happy hour spot with good (and reasonably priced) drinks and great food.",

    "text": "I usually never give bad reviews but I had to here. First time ever to a Mad Mex and the food I got was terrible, flavorless and tasted a couple days old. I was hoping to ask for some salt to add to it so I could eat some of it but my waitress was nowhere in site. After a good 20 minutes after bringing us our food she finally comes over asks if I need a box for my untouched plate. By this time I just wanted to pay and leave so I could try and get some dinner somewhere else before it got late so I said no thank you, it wasn't that good and she goes ok and quickly disappears before I could ask for the check, and is gone again for another 20 mins. We had to ask another waitress to find her so we could get our check. She comes back a little upset and asks \"were you guys looking for me?\" We just ask for our check. She leaves without a word, sets it down without a word and doesn't come back so we ended up just having to leave cash and walking out of there.   For me, if service is bad but the food is really good I'll still come back to a place because good tasting food is more important in my opinion. But this all around was a shit show. Maybe I'll try a different location, but I will definitely not be coming back to this one.",

(Protein options for meat-eaters and veg alike, so everyone can find something they like.) The fall vegetable mix (roasted Brussel sprouts, cauliflower, and butternut squash) can be added to most things - salads, burritos, etc. And the butternut squash soup is fantastic. In the spring, they did something with asparagus and snow peas. Portion sizes are huge. The pick-a-dippa appetizer combo is great if you want to try the different heat levels of salsa; the guac is subtle, cooling, so I like it as a balance to the pineapple-habanero salsa, my favorite for clearing the sinuses.   I've found the service to be good 90% of the time. There's always that odd time when you'll get a new server - usually at the beginning of the summer when the college students first start. But year-round, the bar service is friendly and on point. I'm not a big marg drinker, so I can't comment on the subtleties of the margarita options. But the beer menu is large.",

The one thing that bummed me out - the chips and salsa... Ok, they charge for it which I don't like, but whatever. What bugged me was we paid almost $4 for what seemed like the bottom of the barrel of chips. Lots of little corners and crumbs.",

    "text": "I absolutely wish they had a Mad Mex in New Jersey.  This place is pretty much all I look for in a Mexican restaurant.  Apparently, there are about 7 Mad Mex's all in the Pittsburgh area.  The weird thing about this one is that it is located at the bottom of an office building.  Our group started at the bar.  The bar area was actually pretty packed on a Tuesday night - mostly during Happy Hour time.  There was only bartender working and she was completely overwhelmed.  It took a while to get a drink.  They definitely should have had at least one other bartender working.  They had a decent draft selection and everyone said the margaritas were pretty good.  I did not try one.    Our table was seated and I'm pretty sure there were at least 10 of us or so.  The waiter was very good and attentive throughout the meal.  Our table started out with a bunch of different baskets of chips and a number of dips.  1. Guacamole - it was good but it had a little too much lime zest for my taste.  If you're into that, you're going to love this one.  2. Red Salsa - I liked the red salsa but I felt like it could have used a touch more spice.  Not bad, though.  3. Queso Dip - we also had some sort of queso dip that was good.  It was my 2nd favorite - nice and spicy and who doesn't like cheese?  4. Black Bean Dip - typically, I'm not the biggest bean dip fan but this was excellent.  It had some melted cheese and it had just the right amount of spice to it.  I was surprised I liked it so much and I would definitely order it again.  I housed a ton of chips and dip - probably too much but I enjoyed it.  For my meal, I went with the Spicy Mad Mex Burrito and I went with chicken as the filler.  Also, the burritos are ridiculously cheap at less than $10...and they're huge.  It's served American style - this is kind of like my own term - meaning it doesn't come with melted cheese and a side of rice and beans.  It's served in a huge tortilla wrapped up with only a little bit of some sort of chipotle sauce on top.  It also came with a ton of guac, sour cream and salsa on the side.  It's amazing how many places are stingy with those but not Mad Mex.  They totally hook you up.  The burrito was pretty freakin' good.  Nice and spicy and came stuffed with a ton of fillers.  It was also huge - I have to stress that.  Not many people will be able to finish a burrito in one sitting.  It's a huge meal, but the quality of the food was also very good.    This is a really cool place.  I enjoyed everything about my meal.  Service was pretty good and the prices are more than reasonable - dare I say cheap.  I'll easily come out of my way to stop back here again the next time I am in Pittsburgh.  I'm hoping Mad Mex opens up some spots in Jersey by me.",

It's a bit on the expensive side for Mexican food, but you do seem to get a lot for your money, and I've never been disappointed coming here.   I have had the burritos (spicy chicken is good), the chimichanga, and the wings, all were great, and tasted even better after supplementing the food with a delicious IPA or a 'Big-Azz' margarita (strawberry is my go-to). There house salsa is good in my opinion, but not for those with an aversion to cilantro. The 'fire roasted' salsa wasn't so great and tasted like the house salsa with way too much liquid smoke added.   The best time to go is probably for the happy hour and the late night half-off deals. Mad Mex isn't anything outstanding and certainly isn't 'authentic Mexican,' but if you find yourself tired of the same old Chipotle/Qdoba burritos, Mad Mex is a nice, tasty (albeit more expensive) change of pace.   Come for the burritos, stay because you can't legally drive after your Big-Azz margarita.",

After finally locating the place (a bit of an odd location that lacks good visibility) I was promptly seated at a bar-side high top that afforded a good view of the Pirates/Rockies broadcast. The server (B. Starkey) visited me quickly and was friendly/helpful throughout the meal.  I'm getting old and was quickly reminded of that depressing fact as I struggled a bit attempting to read the menu. With nothing unusual or surprising offered I went with the Chicken Fajita ($14). The order arrived in less than 15 minutes. All ingredients were tasty (while the chicken portion seemed a bit stingy)and I found myself eating the nicely seasoned veggies at meal's end.   My only issue was that cleanliness seemed to be a factor. My table was sticky and the restroom needed work (even considering the place was relatively busy). Mad Mex would certainly be a better location with a group but I would visit the next time visiting Pittsburgh. Give it a try...but come with a group and a pocket flashlight!",

Some things need updating such as chip baskets that are frayed and coming apart.  The menu had decent variety but just seemed like standard Mexican fare.  Nothing like the Salsa seemed like it was made fresh.  Just basic fare.  Even the burritos just seemed like they were basic.  No great thought or Wow! factor. It wouldn't hurt to have daily features of some sort to enhance the menu. Just not a place I'd make \"must visit again\" .",

    "text": "I love most of the Mad Mex locations that I've tried.  This one is close to lots of shopping.  I loved their Horny Toad Margarita, which unfortunately is no longer on the menu.  But if you get an old timer, they'll still make it for you.  The closest thing to the Horny Toad is the Ultimate.  If you like a wicked sour margarita, this is the one for you.  I'm not a fan of the big azz margaritas that are popular there, they're  just too sweet for me.  The red sangria rocks!!  There's always and awesome selection of drafts and bottled beers too.  I like this location because it's really small and really dark.  I know that's not a plus for lots of people, but I like it.  I love the Insane San Francisco Wings with Blue Cheese.  We always order them well done.  Insane is the highest on their heat scale, the heat level isn't consistent, but it's usually pretty hot.  The blue cheese is a perfect balance to the garlicy San Francisco sauce.  My husband almost always gets the Chicken Chimichanga, its generously stuffed with tasty chicken, it's always nice and crispy.  I love most of the quesadillas and fajitas... but I think my favorite entree is the Dance Marathon Enchiladas.  I love the garlicy portabello mushrooms and spicy spinach.  The tortilla soup is thick and creamy and so good.  The casa salad is awesome with the Lime Cilantro dressing.  A garlicy spicy creamy pesto-type dressing that is also great to add as a dipping sauce for quesadillas and taquitos.   The salad is a simple combination of leaf lettuce, cherry tomatoes, red onions, blue cheese crumbles, green pepitas... the crunchy pepitas with the salty, tangy blue cheese topped with lime cilantro dressing... YUM!!!!  One of my favorite places to eat.",

GREAT! We were waited on , and the restraunt manager came buy and said that wasn't good, but we could stay...we got some food,but one in our party wanted his steak to go because of the VERY LONG WAIT...soon after, ALL our our food is boxed up and the check is presented!!! What the heck??The waitress said it was a mistake...an what did we wanna do? DUH! I paid, and won't be back...There are plenty of dinner places in this area, FORGET THIS ONE!",

I don't know if there was any alcohol at all in any of them to be honest.  I think that is a rip-off, so you are better off getting beer at this location or making friends with the bartender.   I felt no effect at all from 46oz of margarita?  Really?  i was sitting outside, so couldn't see the bartender make the drinks.  I am a former owner of a bar and years of experience in the industry, so it ins't like I don't know what I am talking about.  Anyway, the food was okay and service was okay.  I just would like to get what I pay for when it comes to drinks.   Maybe next time I will ask for the tequila on the side, so I can actually see if they put any in at all!",

    "text": "Recommendation: A must visit! Delicious and unique food, great presentation, helpful and friendly service. I would definitely return and recommend it.   Food: The food was pretty great! We started off by getting delicious locally-made chips and Pineapple Habanero salsa. The salsa was uniquely sweet and spicy, but the spice wasn't enough to overpower the fruity flavor. I ordered a Spicy Mad Mex Burrito, which is a typical rice/beans/steak burrito with some added spice. It came with sour cream, guacamole, and pico de gallo on the side, all of which were excellent. The pico de gallo was a little on the dry side, but the moisture from the rest of the ingredients was more than enough to counter it. I ended up eating half the burrito and taking the rest (and as many chips as I could) home to eat for a snack later.    Ambience: The decoration was great! Lots of laser-cut metal with tex-mex decoration, the plates were colorful, and the music was hip and modern while not being Top 40 hits. I have to say I seriously enjoyed the menus, which were a leather and wood wrapped affair and were very nice. The food names and descriptions were entertaining while also being extremely easy to interpret.   Service: Our waitress was friendly and helpful without being too imposing. She frequently refilled our water, which was wonderful considering the spicy foods we ate and the fact we sat outside in the heat. She checked on us often, brought out our food quickly, and processed our check rapidly as well. It was great!  Final thoughts: I'd definitely go here again. There were a variety of other items on the menu I'd like to try, the prices were completely reasonable (each dish was about $10) and the ambiance was inviting. Can't wait to go back!",

The queso has a good amount of heat if you like that and the ranch provides a nice savory finish. Our next entree's we're the avocado quesadilla and the flank steak street style tacos. Both dishes had different things we liked about each. The quesadilla was a very safe dish and could be accommodated to fit anybody. The tacos in my opinion we're excellent though.",

The food is always awesome, the servers upbeat and friendly, the atmosphere is fun...I really have never had any complaints. Though we live very close to the Lakeside location, my fiance' and I decided to stop in for a late lunch while running errands in Robinson. While the food and drinks were okay (our food was a little soggy, but that's understandable with wraps and burritos), the service was not!   Our server seemed completely uninterested in us, and acted as if taking our order was a chore. When the food runner brought out our appetizer, one of the salsas was incorrect.  When our sever came to check on us a good 10 minutes later, she noticed (we weren't even going to bother her with it) and stated \"That's the wrong salsa - I'll be back with the right one,\" in an annoyed tone as if it was our fault. The entire time she barely made eye contact and was rude. We asked for boxes as we were in a bit of a time crunch,  and she came back with two tiny containers, despite the fact that there was quite a lot of food left on the table (almost all of my meal). When she returned with our card after we paid, she mumbled a thank you and walked away.   Now, I do get it - there are bad days. I was a server and manager for several years, and I know you can't be 100% on point sometimes, but goodness! At least smile? She acted as if we were not worthy to be dining there We won't be back to this location.",

I don't know if they were short-staffed, but our waitress would disappear for long periods of time before returning to us. We had the dip trio for an appetizer which was good. We chose black bean dip, queso, and guacamole. The black bean dip is so good! We also all had margaritas which were nicely sized for the price. My meal was where it went a little south for me. I ordered a chicken quesadilla, and the peppers and onions were burnt in places but raw in others. It was pretty unpleasant. I think I would want to try other Mexican restaurants before returning here. Especially since it took nearly 2 hours to have a meal on a weekday night.",

My absolute go to when I come is the Carnitas Burrito (Pork slow-roasted in garlic, ancho chili and Dos Equis. Roasted green chilis inside, blue cornbread, pico and sweet-n-sour slaw on the side). The pork is ALWAYS tender and juicy and that slaw just does something to this dish that I can not explain. The cornbread is always welcomed as it is usually warm and fresh. Plus, it's such a big portion that I can usually get about four meals out of it.  For dessert, we usually get the chocolate brownie to share. It is definitely one of those things that you have to share. A huge brownie, four scoops of ice cream and a bunch of whipped cream. Pretty much heaven in a dish. I'm not sure what the deal is with the ice cream, but its definitely better than any vanilla ice cream that I have ever had.   The margaritas are to die for. I can easily finish a few Big Azz margs without even thinking about it (though it really isn't a good idea!)   The service is always exceptional. The staff is always so attentive, even on a very busy night. I definitely would recommend this location if you are in the area.",

Once a Pittsburgh-only, super-local chain, they have expanded as a local chain in surrounding towns. This location is probably my second favorite due to it's convenient location, good service, and fun atmosphere (behind Shadyside which has two floors and a huge open air windows). My favorite thing about Mad Mex is that they have a huge variety of flavorful food - large, fresh salads to burritos and even lots of vegan friendly options. Also the strawberry margarita is almost dessert-like which I find pretty delightful.",

    "text": "I was torn as to how low to rate our experience at Mad Mex. I'd say this place certainly falls somewhere between 2 or 3 stars. Here's why...  Food: The food here is average (at best). We both ordered the \"Mad Mex\" quesadillas. I've had better quesadillas from Chili's. I actually even make a better quesadilla at home. We both agreed that it was just subpar. The real irony here is that you'd expect a menu item named after the actual restaurant to be superior in quality to the other menu options. Correct? The quesadillas here are just blah and as for the guacamole, I've had equally as good from Trader Joe's. They come with no sides, so expect to pay around $2 for about 4oz. of canned black beans.   Service: So we stopped in over the weekend and ordered dinner. We stood at the hostess station for about 5 minutes patiently waiting for a hostess to appear. She never did. We finally walked to the bar and the kind bartender apologized and explained that things were slow, so they'd just sent home the hostess. Okay that's fine, but why not have the servers or someone else lookout for potential customers? Silly error.  We requested to be seated on the patio. It was night time, but boy was it dark! I'm talking parking lot lights to read the menu dark! Here's a tip...Get some light so that customers can actually read the menu at night or just close the patio altogether after dark. I probably would have ordered more if I could have actually seen the menu.  Let there be light.  Our waitress kindly informed us that the kitchen was taking last call on orders and would be closing an hour before close of business. Fine. Restaurant hours are listed for close at 1am and we arrived 11:30. We understand that kitchens typically close early, but we were clearly being rushed to hurry up and pick something. Again, I would have liked to get an appetizer and dessert, but felt pressed for time. Lastly, as if the aforementioned wasn't enough, the waitress was apathetic. Just bad.   Bottom Line: I wouldn't go here again. Food is average (or slightly below) and the service is lacking. There are far too many better restaurants in the area with higher quality standards.",

It is all super health conscious, very fresh, steamed veggies, if not raw veggies. You find chunks of zuchinni, strips of corn off cob in your burrito. I think I found a couple green beans in my burrito. Maybe some cucumber. Why not? Their black beans are steamed.  If you are doing the health conscious, lookin good, diet, go to a Mad Mex. I did see their bar before. If you are a drinker, you will like their bar.  But if you like Tasty Mexican food, pass on Mad Mex. Go to Jose & Tonys or Taco Bell.",

It's 9:00 on a Thursday night and half dead and the waitperson (plus trainee) took ten minutes before they asked if I wanted a drink, and then didn't bring a food menu. After another five minutes I had to ask for a menu and then it was another fifteen minutes before anyone came to take my order. When I pointed out that the wait was unreasonable, the trainer was rude and said \"why didn't you just flag me down?\" Is that my job, as a patron?!? Also, you can't flag someone down who is nowhere to be found. Lame. Post-script; my food just arrived and the server just shoved it in front of me, and said nothing. Literally nothing. Not \"can I get you anything else?\" Not \"sorry for your wait.\" Absolutely nothing. I will never come back to this location and might need to swear off Big Burrito properties more generally. Totally unacceptable.",

    "text": "We had gone here pretty late for dinner, later than I usually eat but I figured we were hungry and I really wanted to check this place out.  We arrived around 10pm after a long day of driving and shopping but I was looking forward to eating here for quite some time.  I knew they were open late and I was pretty hungry and when that happens I get pretty greedy.  Jake was our server this evening and I had told him it was our first time at Mad Mex so I'd have to go through the menu a bit.  There is a lot of choices here, burritos, tacos, enchiladas, fajitas, chili, it just went on and on.  The drinks menu was pretty interesting.  It was sort of confusing as it appeared there were some drinks on both the drink menu and the main menu but I ended up with a Green Flash PA.  I've been drinking a lot of pale ales recently and this one was really good.  A smooth taste and a nice hoppy flavor.  I ended up ordering 2 of these that night.  My wife ordered an apple cidar margarita.  I tasted it and it was really good.  It tasted like an apple pie.  My wife who does not drink anything really besides wine and very little at that drank the whole thing and loved it.     Jake brought a really generous serving of salsa and chips.  The salsa was really good.  Not runny but solid chunks of tomatoes.    I had ordered the large order of San Francisco style wings (honestly I didn't know what that meant) which on the menu said that they were sweet and tangy or something like that.  Jake asked if I wanted them spicy and I basically said middle of the road was fine.  My wife can't really handle hot so I thought it was safe.  The wings were just awesome.  Properly cooked through and through and crispy and saucy at the same time.  Hot and fresh, and as I said, cooked well.  My wife can't eat wings if they aren't cooked well so it passed that test with flying colors.  I loved these wings and for a large order that said something to the effect that were 14 or so it seemed to go on and on.  I didn't count them but it seemed to be more than 14 wings.  They weren't small and skimpy either.  We're talking naked wings (not breaded) but they were meaty and filling.  My wife had ordered the turkey chili and I had ordered mahi mahi tacos.  While my wife had her chili she said it was really good but it was overly spicy for her.  I had tried it and it was really tasty but I had agreed it was rather on the hot spicy side and for her she unfortunately can't handle that level.  Jake said it had chipotle in it.  For me to think it was rather on the hot side, it's hot.  I eat a lot of hot and she had forsaken the chickpea chili because it had jalepeno in it.  She probably would have been better off with that instead.  Still, the chili was a solid chili, just too hot for her.  She had more wings and I gave her a taco and offered her more but she only wanted one.    The mahi mahi tacos were amazing.  They had that grilled taste and the baha sauce had a really nice kick to to it.  The food here was simply great, just a tad hot and I can't believe I'm saying that...   I'd love to go back to Mad Mex and try more of their menu.  I'd love to try their carnitas.",

I liked the interior mucho, ha!  See what I did there? *cheesy grin*  ANYWHO, we ended up ordering the Dance Marathon Enchilada (w/ chicken, spinach, and portabella mushroom) and the Kristy's Big Sister's Red Velvet Quesadilla (chicken, grilled zucchini, spinach, pico de gallo and jack cheese).  Oh, and I say \"we\" because my mom and I always split our food!    Let's start with the good.  The quesadilla was AWESOME!  Pipin' hot and perfectly cooked.  I also LOVED the side of guac that accompanied the dish - probably the best guac I've had in years.  FYI: it was a lunch special ($9.50) so it came with soup - you can also get salad if you wants.  We went with the turkey chili, and it was RIDICULOUSLY tasty - lots of hearty filling with BAMF heat.    Unfortunately, my Enchilada was \"meh\".  I feel bad because it was mad fresh with tons of grilled chicken and veggies, but it was tasteless.  I had a really rough time finishing it.  The beans and rice that came with it were even worse - pretty sure the rice was old because  It was hard and dry.  CONCLUSION: I'd definitely come back for the Quesadilla lunch special!  I'd also be down to try the Fajitas out, but I won't be getting the Enchiladas anytime soon. Also, the happy hour seemed legit!  Might be back to check that out with frands! Who knows...",

    "text": "Best. People. On. The. Planet. Ever.   True. Story.    I don't know where to begin.  My love affair with Mad Mex Robinson is a long & complicated relationship that is difficult to explain in such limited wording. But tonight represents it nicely.  Mr.Toddler & I dined w the grandparents & Uncle.  From the excellent personalized greeting from Dan, who was busy with tending bar, &  to the manager stopping to check on the table despite the rush- the individual people make this location stand out as special.   During the hubbub Mr Toddler had a meltdown because he recognized the kids dessert bowl and one was accidentally brought to the table and almost set down. It was meant for elsewhere. Mad Mex is so nice that when he recognized it, they sent him his own complimentary kids brownie sundae for their mistake but without the ice cream that he doesn't eat the other one had. And trust me.  He enjoyed every single bite of the brownie, fudge, & whipped cream.  He gave it five \"yums\"   But this what really showed that they care about customers. We forgot Mr. Toddlers best friend behind on the floor. His stuffed dog.  When I realized this at bedtime- the hight of business on a Friday night, not only had he been set aside with care but he was brought out to the car so Mr.Toddler wouldn't have to get out of his car seat! That's a team who really gets & cares about their regulars.    So ya, you can choose any Mad Mex in the area. The menus are the same.  The foods a personal presence of you like Cali-MEX. Its certainly not Authentic Mexican food. Don't try to fool yourself into thinking it is. But it's certainly extremely tasty American Mex.  Like, REALLy Really good. Drink the ranch dressing good. In fact, Mr. Toddler pretty much just uses the chips as a vessel to scoop the dressing into his mouth.   We tend to order the same items often. The kids quesadilla, adult chicken fajita, chicken quesadilla, or enchilada.   I love it all.    And when it comes to choosing a location, I think Robinson is hands down hitting way above the highest mark!",

I love their menu, I love their drinks, and I enjoy stopping in to enjoy enormous meals at great prices. This particular location is not the closest Mad Mex to me, but it certainly struck me as the potentially least crowded location I've been too - especially since I visited on a Thursday.  This Mad Mex is the first in the chain where I ordered tacos during my visit (I'm pretty fond of this chain's burritos and quesadillas and usually order one of those). I opted for their special tacos, which were basically veggie tacos with shiitake mushrooms and asparagus. What I got had a unique flavor profile and I really enjoyed it since it wasn't the typical round of taco toppings. And the tacos alone would have been plenty of food, but the order also came with rice and beans. I was more than satisfied with my meal.  The only thing I could negatively comment on about my first visit here was that a friend's tea order was seemingly lost by our waitress. My friend ultimately had to ask for it again when the food arrived. But none of our food orders were wrong, and we each got our water, so for the most part we were all more than satisfied with our service. I would definitely come back again.",

Ah the chips and salsa... the chips seem no different than those found in a Giant Eagle. The salsa is WEAK! It is basically chopped tomatoes with a sneeze of onion, cilantro and peppers... virtually no flavor at all.   Lastly there's the service... what was our waitress doing between visits to our table... smoking? It was a Tuesday night and there was barely anyone there!  This should be a solid pass for all... you'll get better quality and taste from a Qdoba.",

My mom & I both got chicken enchiladas with vegetables and they were delicious- while our order was not vegetarian, they offered many vegetarians options or substitutions.  The music was loud but they moved us to a quieter table without a problem.  I wouldn't have found Mad Mex without Yelp & was even a bit unsure when we pulled up - but I am so glad we went and will highly recommend it (I might also recommend splitting a meal if you won't be able to refrigerate left overs because so much awesome food).   Got more food than I expected for the price of our enchiladas and the flavors & textures were excellent !",

For gluten and dairy sensitive people like me, there is non-dairy cheese and sour cream and corn tortillas. They even have non-dairy ranch for the wings!

You can't go wrong with \"Big Azz\" margaritas and doesn't-make-you-sick, Americanized Mexican food. I frequent the Robinson location regularly, as I both work and also also live nearby. Lunches with co-workers, happy hours, date nights and dinner and drinks with friends have always been hosted at Mad Mex, with delicious drinks, boneless wings, pick-a-dippa, and decent, but not-delicious meals.   Throughout the years, I've seen several families inside the restaurant. A children's' menu, high chairs, and a dark, loud restaurant made Mad Mex our first choice for dining when our friends came into town. (You see, they have a toddler and I have an infant, plus there aren't a whole lot of non-chain restaurants in the area.)   We walked in at 5:20pm on a Saturday evening and asked for a table for 4 with two high chairs; we were seated at a booth and given only one high chair, as policy prohibits flipping the chairs upside down to accommodate an infant carrier (annoying, but....fine...whatever.) We were given 3 adult menus for 4 adults (?) and a children's menu and crayons for the toddler. The high chair was FILTHY! As my friend cleaned it for her toddler, the waitress greeted us and proceeded to tell us that most people don't bring their kids to the restaurant. We instantly felt embarrassed for bringing our families and unwelcome.   Despite our less-than-desirable greeting, we decided to stay. Margaritas, tortilla chips, guacamole and salsa were happily devoured. As usual, the dinners were just okay, boasting uncooked vegetables in the BARErito (think burrito bowl) and fajitas and undercooked blue cornbread, served with the enchiladas.  While the toddler seemed to enjoy her quesadilla, brownie and ice cream from the kids' menu, we will likely not return to Mad Mex, by choice - certainly not as a family - after being made to feel unwelcome.   Oh, and by the way, I counted 8 young children in high chairs on the floor and spotted two families with carriers waiting to be seated. I hope their experience was better than ours.",

She didn't really check in with us after our meals were served otherwise she would have learned that I HATED my food. It's rare that I encounter food I don't like but the chicken mole burrito I had was terrible. They melted the cotija cheese on top which is usually a fresh crumbled cheese. The smell was so off-putting that I couldn't even eat my meal. Maybe it was bad or something!? The waitress could've asked why I didn't eat but she didn't seem to care or maybe she just wasn't paying attention. I took a bite of the hubs carnita tacos. They weren't too bad which is why I gave this place an extra star.   The restaurant wasn't really clean. It smelled like it was wiped down with a dirty rag or something. Right outside the restroom area was a dustpan full of dirt and grimy litter from the floors. Just looking at it made me nauseous. Made me wonder what kind of condition the kitchen was in but I'd rather not think about it.   Won't be back. Spent $50 on apps and food that I didn't touch. Yeah- Bad Mex!",

Now if I wanted canned trans fats died orange, I would have gone to Walmart and opened up a can of goo for about a buck. But I wouldn't do that because I wouldn't even serve this slip to a dog!

    "text": "Mad Mex is exactly how Yelp describes a two-star review: \"Meh. I've experienced better\". A Pennsylvania Mexican restaurant chain famous for its humongous margaritas and Thanksgiving-themed Gobblerito, Mad Mex offers average-tasting food at a price that isn't particularly friendly. Don't get me wrong, the burritos are very large, and you'll most likely have some leftovers, but you probably won't be overly motivated to eat your leftovers the next day.  This restaurant claims to offer a mashup of a variety of cuisines (Mexican, American, Southeast Asian, Spanish), but for the most part, the food is very predictable and the flavors are very simple. Nothing on the menu is bad, but there really isn't anything on the menu worth writing home about either. I will say that their waffle fries are some of the best fries I've ever had, but besides that, I haven't found a dish on their menu that really excites me.  This review would be incomplete if I didn't mention that I bit into a small stone in my take-out burrito when I ordered from this Mad Mex a few months ago. I contacted the restaurant chain, but never heard back.",

They get carrot sticks and celery as an appetizer, get a very nice-sized meal, and an awesome warm brownie with ice cream, and their drink for only $6. I am usually only a fan of Mad Mex at Gobblerito time, but the fam really wanted to go here. I had a seasonal item from the menu- grilled chicken and corn burrito. Unfortunately the burrito was mostly rice, with some chicken and barely any corn- just a few kernels here and there. This is a shame because I love their corn and have to been known to steal spoonfuls from my kids' meals here on occasion.",

Most of the items on the menu aren't your typical Mexican food, I see this place as a Tex mex! We all ordered margaritas & later I ordered a shrimp burrito. The rice was a little dry, but I enjoyed my burrito as my family enjoyed their meals as well. Some got the nachos, quesadillas, tacos, etc & all were pretty satisfied.   The food took very, very long to come out, but our waitress Sarah did a great job keeping us entertained and filled up on our drinks. She's kind, very patient, and diligent with how she serves. I think she did a great job & watching her treat the other tables with upmost respect was a great site to see!

    "text": "As a lover of all things Mexican (although Mad Mex puts it's own twist on Mexican), I can't believe I've waited so long to give Mad Mex a try. My boyfriend and I have adopted more vegan meals into our diet lately, and we were in search of a restaurant that our non-vegan friends would enjoy, too. Mad Mex's family environment and vegan menu items fit the bill for what we were in search of, and it was a great first experience at their Robinson location.  For starters, we got the classic guac and salsa and our friends got the queso. The menu says that Mad Mex's style is \"Cali-Mex,\" which from my own taste buds seems to combine Asian fusion with classic Mexican cuisine. I ordered the tofu tacos that came with beans and rice, but I subbed out the regular sour cream for vegan sour cream. I was SO pumped to see they had vegan sour cream, because no one likes dry, boring tacos! My boyfriend got the tofu and portobello fajitas, and since his meal came with cheese he subbed that out for the vegan Daiya cheese, too.  I wasn't sure what to expect from a tofu taco, but the bean sprouts, sauces, and crispiness of the tofu blew my expectations out of the water. The tofu was marinated in Mad Mex's citrusy-ginger-soy sauce and it was FULL of amazing flavors. Anyone that has worked with tofu knows that the challenge lies in getting the tofu to soak up and retain flavor so it isn't bland, and Mad Mex mastered this skill with their tofu tacos. I would order these 1000 times. The vegan sour cream was just icing on the cake at this point.  While to tofu in my tacos was out of this world, I was a little unimpressed with my boyfriend's fajitas. The tofu looked like it wasn't marinated or flavored, and after ordering the waitress came back and said the fajita sauce isn't vegan. At first there was no substitute offered for the sauce, but my boyfriend just asked for a cup of the sauce that my tofu was in to add some jazz to an otherwise plain dish. I was glad to hear him say the veggies gave it some flavor, because tofu without sauce is definitely not the most exciting thing to eat.  Overall, the menu substitutions made all the difference for us. It's not easy to find a good restaurant that satisfies both plant-based eaters and those with a traditional diet, and Mad Mex made that whole situation a lot less stressful. The food was good, prices were fair, and service was quick. We'll be back again, and next time I'll be sure to indulge in a margarita (or a few!)",

    "text": "While in Pittsburgh we decided to give Mad Mex a try since we had driven by it a few times.   My husband had the Chicken Tacos, my brother had the Mad Mex Burrito, the kids shared the Dino Nuggets and I had the Crabby Corn Quesadilla. The food was pretty good. My husband enjoyed his tacos, but said that the flavor profile changed a bit by the third taco. My brother said that his burrito was good especially considering the price. My crab-corn quesadilla was good, but it was missing a salsa component to it. We had ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer as well, so I ended up using leftover salsa for my quesadilla. It really just needed some spice or something. I tried the Black Cherry frozen margarita, and I thought it was good. It wasn't too strong, and had the right amount of sweetness.   The portions are a good size, so you definitely get a lot of food for what you pay for it. I just can't say much else about the food. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't food that I am going to crave or MUST have. Would I eat there again if it is suggested? Sure, but it isn't on the top of my list. I have had way better Mexican food.   The service wasn't bad either. It wasn't spectacular, but the server was nice and attentive to refills for the most part. The decor was cool, and you could tell that they put a lot of thought into it. I honestly have to say though that this is the first time I really feel ambivalent about a food place. I have no strong feelings either way.",

It took 15 minutes for her to acknowledge me, another 15 to get my order. The food was delicious I will say. She never stopped to ask if we were good or anything. I'm not sure if it was because we were younger and she thought we wouldn't tip, but being in the service industry, we know how it is. Honestly don't think she would have even got my order if I didn't say out loud \"I wonder if she's going to get my order\" as she took the orders of literally EVERY table around me.

    "text": "I dig a Mad Mex (even though they are a chain), but this one was a bit lacking for sure.  Most of the trouble could be attributed to our server, who seemed decidedly uninterested in her job.  She did bring things promptly because she wasn't busy, but it was with a sort of lazy apathy that I couldn't quite get behind.   She didn't really ever make eye contact and didn't go out of her way at all to make us feel welcome.     Where she really got me, though, was the delivery of a beer.  My boyfriend ordered a beer and when she brought it, she dropped it with the following statement:  \"The bartender said this was the last pour of the keg, so it might be a little flat\".   And then walked away.   No apology, no \"would you like something else\", no \"let me know and I'll take care of it\", no nothing.   The beer was indeed a little flat, not that she asked specifically.  When she came by for a random check, he told her it was flat and not great, but that he'd drink it.  She said ok and walked off.   Again, without any further ado.  He would not have demanded or accepted a freebie or even asked for a different beer - but it would have been nice if she'd acted like she cared at least a little.        Food was average for a Mad Mex.  The salsa seemed a little off and my tacos were drowning in excess juice from the black beans, but the service was really the problem.",

We arrived just before 6pm on Weds and were seated immediately, which for a group of 9 people was pretty impressive.   The restaurant is a little drafty and cold. The music was on way too loud, especially when you have a large table of people, its hard enough to hear conversation. But it appeared clean, modern, and not too over-the-top cheesy as some Mexican themed places can be.   The menu is packed with options with fresh ingredients. I tried the steak tacos with grilled street corn. They were delicious, a bit spicy for my taste, but still very good. The portion size was generous. We also ordered some appetizers to try and I loved the guac. It was creamy and flavorful.   Our service was good and our waitress tried hard to keep drinks topped off and used plates cleared.   Overall, it was a good experience and I'd return when in town again!",

You also apparently have to ask / remind about what is supposed to come with kids meal. No carrots and celery.  Our son helped us remember about the dessert.  So he didn't miss that.  This isn't the first time that one of the locations didn't automatically bring or ask about what the kids meal included.  My menu also had food remnants in it.

    "text": "This particular location tends to draw in more families with children than the other locations, so it can get noisy and the acoustics are pretty bad - lots of hard surfaces.  A friend had a wedding reception at this location and the service was great and very accommodating.  This may have been because they were guaranteed a big, BIG tip, but either way I was pleased.  If you're a hardcore fan of authentic Mexican food, this is probably not the place for you.  The enchiladas remind me more of chilaquiles - definitely more layered than rolled.  The burritos are huge but it really drives me crazy how segmented they are.  One bite will be all rice, the next will be all meat.  The tofu tacos are okay, but the bean sprouts seem like a weird addition.  I know, you're probably thinking \"What DOES this girl like about Mad Mex?\"  If you can let go of any previous Mexican food experiences (or if you've never had Mexican food before, as I hadn't when I first went to Mad Mex), some things are ok.  The tofu tacos minus the bean sprouts.  The California grilled salad.  The chickpea chili and black bean soup, the potato taquitos.  Nachos, chips & salsa, and guacamole are all decent.  Their sides are ridiculously huge and the desserts are all ok (except the sopapillas).  Basically, stick to the least authentic stuff and you should be fine.  Additionally, some of their entrees are available with your choice of either chicken, steak, shrimp, portobello mushrooms or tofu.  They have tons of vegetarian options.  They have good happy hour deals and good late night margarita deals.  They have raspberry, strawberry, mango, and kiwi margaritas year round, with one or two seasonal flavors per month, plus a full bar, a bunch of tequilas and a huge, varied beer list that tends to focus on local beers.  So basically: the less you know about Mexican food, the less disappointed you will be.  If you're a fan of authentic Mexican food, either stick to something more basic like a salad, or pick a different restaurant.",

    "text": "i've visited 3 mad mex locations in Pittsburgh (Robinson, Oakland, & Greentree) and have yet to go wrong. on this particular visit, my friend and i took advantage of coupons for free burritos that we'd been sent via email for signing up for the Mad Mex mailing list. They aren't bombing my inbox too frequently except for the things I'd like to know about (like new beer selections available.) The Robinson location is in a corporate looking building but once you're inside, you'd never know it. We visited around lunch time. The music was good. There were tables available inside and outside and we had our pick. Our server was terrific, giving us plenty of time to figure out what we wanted to order. My friend tried the russion stout on nitro tap which was a good time. The food was as great as I've come to expect from Mad Mex. I didn't care for the toritilla soup that came as part of my  meal--but that was on me. There were other selections available that may have better suited my tastes, for sure. I'm used to a more spicy tortilla soup so my expectations weren't met there but that isn't Mad Mex's fault! The carnitas burrito was delicious and the blue cornbread a perfect pairing. I'd visit any of the Max Mex locations I've been to so far again & wouldn't hesitate to explore other locations. The service and food seem consistent so far and when I'm craving sit-down tex-mex, I'd visit Mad Mex again.",

This is a usual happy hour location for my friends and I after work.  Half off drafts and wings.  Pretty good deal! They have a great lunch menu which gives you many dinner options at a lunch price.  You will be stuffed and pleased with the bill.  Also, if you sit at the bar (anytime of the day) you get free chips and salsa.  At dinner the price goes up a little, but still the great food and very filling.  Try the mahi mahi fajita.  It's so amazing I almost cried while eating it.  This is a very vegan friendly restaurant where you can ask for soy sour cream and tofu cheese as substitutes (tastes amazing).   The kids menu at dinner is surprisingly cheap for a lot of food.  They can get a burrito, with sides, and a brownie and ice cream (if I remember this correctly) for like 5 bucks.  That's great, because its hard to rationalize paying big bucks for kids when dinning out.   Also, the staff is very friendly and helpful.  My family loves this place and I highly suggest it, thus the reason I chose to review Mad Mex first as a new Yelp member!",

We still hadn't been seated when we left two hours later. The manager was waving his arms and saying it wasn't his fault, and that there's nothing he can do.   I did give them another chance. I went with a friend on a Monday evening. It was a quiet night and we didn't have any trouble getting seated. The waiter was lethargic, and couldn't answer the simplest questions about the beer or the food menu. The food wasn't anything special, and overpriced for what it was.  My third visit was for drinks in a small group, on a weeknight, perhaps a Wednesday or a Thursday. We were sitting at a table. It was a quiet night, yet we had to keep walking to the bar to tell the staff to find our waiter and send him to our table, over and over again. Even though it was over an hour before closing time, staff kept working with their rags and vacuum cleaners all around us, and making faces like we should consider leaving soon.",

    "text": "I have now been to Mad Mex twice, both with disappointing results.  Mad Mex is about authentic as Taco Bell, that's not a complaint - I just want anyone else reading these reviews should realize this is not True Mexican food. However, they DON'T try to be and are in your face about it which I like. It pisses me off more to fake something and do it poorly than to take parts of it and do it well.  I like the theme and design of the restaurant, the rusted steel plates, cowboy/Inca art motifs, its obviously a fun atmosphere and they have done a great job and spent a lot of money in design. Perhaps they should spend some of that money in training their servers. One of the servers knowledge of the food was pretty bad, I asked three simple questions about menu items and only 1 could be answered. The two she couldn't answer there was no attempt to find out - a simple \"I don't know\" seemed as an acceptable answer. However, the server we had on another visit was much better.  For starters we have tried the pepito hummus - great idea, but salty, very very salty, the other starter I've tired is the chicken tortilla soup - the soup was good even though there was not one piece of chicken in it. It's definitely not a traditional tortilla soup instead you have rustic cream of tomato soup with garlic, cumin and other spices. As I said not traditional - good - very mild flavor, it could have used a little bit more spiciness and of course the chicken the menu proclaimed it had.  I have read and was told that their burritos were very good so the first time I tried Chicken Fajita Burrito. These are knife and fork burritos that come out square. On the side is Pico de Gallo, which in my case was warm, contained the tomato core and was flavorless. My burrito contained bland rice, unseasoned black beans, red and green bell peppers and onions - some burnt, cheese and chicken. I guess the idea was to throw the bell peppers and onions in and viola you have fajita style, unfortunately it had no fajita seasoning so it didn't really work. There was a  nice smoky flavor to the chicken which helped. But overall this burrito needed some serious help - it was bland on the flavors, even the addition of salt would have helped it out. One last comment is the tortilla that was used, a quick trip on the griddle was needed or maybe finish the tortilla in a press but it came out very white, with a doughy almost uncooked flavor.  On the second visit my partner had the Mad Mex burrito with steak and was very disappointed, he thought they had forgot to put the steak in it until the very end he found 4 pieces of meat in the very corner of the square-itto. Until then he was just eathing plain rice and beans - not good.   On the second visit I tried the Dance Marathon enchilada and this resembled and tasted very little like a True enchilada. All they did was put a very small ladle of ancho sauce on the plate, then put on the chicken spinach and mushrooms and top that with tomatillo sauce. Then throw a tortilla on top. Put the required rice and beans on the plate and you have a rather poorly executed and plain tasting dish of food.  Mad Mex looks like a great place to enjoy some drinks, but if what I had was representative of the rest of the  menu offerings I would pass on eating there again - food was very under par and someone should tell them that Mexican foods carry bold flavors - they should at least try to add some of those flavors to what they serve.  Ambiance 5 stars Food 1.5 Stars Service 2.5 Stars  3 Stars and that's only because I really liked the ambiance.",

I really enjoy the food so will continue to eat here, although might be better for carry out if not at a slow time of day and you mind the noise.",

My favorites are the spicy Mad Mex chicken burrito and the spicy black bean dip.  When I first had their salsa I thought it had too much garlic.  But it has really grown on me and I can't eat one of their burritos without slathering on a ton of it.  The service is usually great too.  The only negative is they allow smoking at the bar.",

I thought the decor was dreadfully ugly, tacky and overdone, but my friend (who tells me he has a cast iron stomach but was still internally disturbed by the horrible food here) claims to have liked it.   I am giving this place 2 stars because they had a wide tequila selection (altho they don't seem able to mix a drink to save their lives), and because my friend liked their gaudy art. Service was ok, food was terrible (mostly rice with a tiny scattering of presumably rotten meat), art was questionable.   Bottom line: AVOID, unless you are looking to do shots of top shelf tequila.",

That means big bonus points for me!!  There is no shortage of veggie-friendly menu items, but any time I have made a special request it has been honored without question.    This location seems to have more craft beer on tap than some of the others (namely Oakland).  That's great too!

Good Happy Hours are hard to find these days, Happy Hour there is exactly that - good deals on beer, drinks, and appetizers. We had the trio of dips - the jalepeno pinapple is my new favorite!  On Sunday I picked a friend up from the airport and we wanted to find somewhere we could eat and watch the Superbowl, and this was the perfect spot for that. It wasn't overly crowded like many of the sports bars, and once again our waitress was super friendly. I had a margarita and the shrimp taquitos - both were very good.

My mind is telling me I should of had the burrito ,but I was very hungry and decided to get the chicken and steak fajitas with extra shrimp added on. The portion of food that I got was laughable. I could fill 3 small tortilla shells with everything I got. I paid 23 dollars and definitely was not worth it. My wife got the mahi tacos and had to return them because they were unedable. The fish was so charred and smelled. Our waitress took those off menu for us. ALSO got the chips with 3 dips.. sides were pretty good and chips did not taste too fresh. Drinks were great.  But after spending so much money im not sure if I would return or not,,especially with amazing Mexican restaurants near by.",

Happy hour features half off drafts and wings too so that is probably the best time to visit though. The atmosphere is loud, with televisions around the bar. Service is mediocre at best but the staff is friendly so that balances it out a bit.  If you like hot flavors try the Pineapple Habanero salsa (I find it sweet with a kick). Their guacamole was good at least the couple of times I tried it, and their jersey chips and taquitos make up for my choice of appetizers. If you want to try their wings, the Southwestern and San Francisco are well balanced with spices.   This place will keep you well liquored and pleasantly satiated. Their burritos are ok - I frankly prefer Chipotle or Qdoba burritos, however the Max Mex burritos are humongous and generously packed with a lot of stuffings. The Quesadillas and Fajitas are better choices in my opinion. I liked the hard shell tacos with the grilled steak too, though I found a lack of consistency in the flavor - the meat was well seasoned a couple of times and the other times I found it to be bland.  This is a good place to hang out around the bar, get a few drinks and some appetizers.",

    "text": "Interesting.    My husband and I use this word frequently between us to describe something that we either can't quite grasp the concept of, or as a euphemism for \"this is quite possibly the worst thing we've ever experienced\".  In this case, I think that the use of the word may come to mean both when it comes to Mad Mex.  We had high hopes for this place after reading the Yelp reviews.  Unfortunately, the experience started off on the wrong foot almost immediately - we walked in and were kept waiting for nearly ten minutes while the hostess did - well, I don't know what she was doing.  My husband later said that she was checking for tables, but seeing that the place was half-empty when we walked in, that's kind of hard for me to believe.  To the staff's credit, several people did stop and ask us if we were being helped.  But, still.  We were led to a table and were about to sit down when one of the staff was like, \"No, don't sit down.  It's not clean.\"  And... yeah, no, it wasn't clean.  Spilled drink everywhere.  Not earth-shattering.  But, still....  Finally we're settled in and the server comes up and takes our orders.  She asks us if we want to keep the menus over dinner and I said, sure, we may want something else.  Thing is, she asks us this several times over the course of the night.  Did she forget she'd asked the question or something?  I just found that really odd.  I ordered a Thai Curry burrito, and my husband ordered a Mad Mex Quesadilla plate.  Maybe these were just the wrong things to order, I don't know - but in my case, the Thai ingredients just did NOT fit into the scheme of things.  Peanuts, pineapple and bean sprouts wrapped into a tortilla?  Uh... somehow the taste of this should have been a LOT better, and it sounded a whole hell of a lot better than it actually was.  The sour cream and diced tomatoes that came alongside was just a bizarre addition to what I already considered a bizarre dish.  And the slaw?  Ye Gods, that was just an abomination.  I took one bite of that and left the rest behind, and if I leave any type of cole slaw behind, you KNOW it's bad.    My husband's dish was lacking cheese.  And I mean, it was a SERIOUS lack of cheese.  More veggies than anything else, which is fine, but a good quesadilla has cheese in it, folks.  He did like his food a LOT better than I did mine, though.  Another service misstep - I wasn't asked what kind of filling I wanted in my dish (even though the menu states that there's a choice).  The server came back and asked me almost timidly if chicken was okay - it leads me to believe that the food was already made with chicken in it and she was hoping (or praying) that I wouldn't choose something else.  Luckily for her... I like chicken.   We didn't need those menus after all, because we beat feet out of there.  I knew I wasn't going to want anything else.  I tipped way more than I should have, to be honest, but the quality of the food isn't the server's fault.    I will say that the food choices are... well, interesting.  There are a LOT of vegetarian and vegan options, which I guess for some is a plus - points for the fact that neither dish was overly greasy or even heavy on the stomach, which can be a problem with a lot of Mexican food.  I went in knowing that this wasn't going to be authentic, and I never expected it - but it really shouldn't be THIS \"health-conscious\", and that's the feeling I got when I came in here.  We don't live in the area, so it's highly doubtful that we'll be back, but if we did live here, we most likely wouldn't recommend this place.",

    "text": "Was in Pittsburgh for business and was trying to find something different to eat, something that we didn't have back home in Colorado.   I read the reviews and totally got that this was more Tex-Mex, and I came in with out the expectation of comparing it to the Mexican food I get in Denver, or Pasadena where I lived prior.   At first , being unfamiliar with the area, I couldn't find it.  I almost ended up going to Ditka's ( bldg in this complex) , but as I was pulling around, I saw Mad Mex, in bldg 2 of this complex)- so i gladly made my way over.  I didn't realize this place was in the first floor of an office building.  Good to know :) .  I like the decor and the atmosphere, enjoyed the service, and the queso and chips I ordered.  I ordered enchiladas.  I shouldn't have, because we make enchiladas at home all the time, and it may cloud my judgement.  It came with Colorado 'red' sauce, so I thought I would be ok, and then half green sauce.    The food came out quickly and I did like the green sauce, but didn't care for the Red sauce, it almost reminded me of spaghetti sauce.  So, I ended up scraping it off and trying to smooth out my green sauce.   This isn't going to deter me from coming back and trying something else, it was just a matter of me not being positively overwhelmed with the sauce on this particular item.   I think I would probably like something else, and look forward to updating this review... from good to great :)",

No drink menus and I went back inside the restaurant to get our silverware from behind the host stand.  The queso/cheese dip had that off-color look as if it came from out of a can. I pictured them scraping it out of a can and mixing with their canned rotell tomatoes. And it didn't taste good. They never said it would be fresh though. I had the steak fajitas which were good enough and cooked how I wanted. The drink menu said Dos Equis Special. They should specify if that is that lager or amber. I'll still go to the location in Shadyside for drinks.",

In my experience they have all been consistent in terms of the quality of food and service.    I love me some wing-o-rito (southwestern sauce please) with waffle fries.  I recently discovered you can get a tofu burrito with the same options of wing sauces - score!  The location of this place is interesting - it seems a bit removed but maybe it seems that way because I'm not from the Robinson area.  In any case it wasn't difficult to get to and parking was plentiful on the evenings I've been there.",

Soup definitely made fresh.  Just got my Grilled Mahi Fish Tacos. I'm from the Jersey Shore area where fish tacos at Surf Taco was born... These are amazing!!!  Fresh, not skimpy, abundant and great tasting guacamole has me eating AND typing cause I can't wait to spread the word.  My only complaints are the food came at me too fast and one bartender was crazy although she kept up with managed frenzy.  I am not a big fan of multi-unit, or more so franchises, but I hope Mad Mex comes to NJ! My lunch veggie burrito yesterday and today's dinner were made with consistency and equaled freshness and quality and served pleasantly.  So they got it down so bring it on east please!",

I ordered the barbacoa burrito and ordered double meat for an extra $2.50 and got carnitas meat with it. The burrito was about half rice half meat.

My friend from Columbus was in today to get ready for a job interview tomorrow, he's worked at OSU for years and he wants to teach at CMU. So after he checked in he phoned me and we met at Mad Mex in Robinson.  He gushed about the Mad Mex that recently opened in The Gateway on High St. in Columbus, saying it was one of the hottest restaurants in all of Columbus, and how lucky we are here to have one close to every neighborhood. I ordered the Mission Shipwrecked Double IPA and he had Rogue John John Dead Guy Heller Bock.   Our waitress was so understanding, we decided to enjoy our beers before ordering, and she said \"Sure, enjoy, I'll come back and take your orders when ready.\" So we talked, caught up and enjoyed our libations. Finally I got hungry (and a little buzzed from drinking a double IPA with a specific 12% alcohol listing), I ordered the black bean soup, and Happy Hippy burrito. He had the Mad Mex Burrito with steak and said it was every bit as good, if not better than the Mad Mex in Columbus.  Sure, it's not authentic, it's Cali-Mex, it's fresh, healthy, and I'm sure glad we have the Big Burrito group here in the Burgh!",
