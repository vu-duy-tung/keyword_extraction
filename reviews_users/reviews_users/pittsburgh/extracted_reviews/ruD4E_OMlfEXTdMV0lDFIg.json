We were in town for business and being from the south we were excited to find a southern soul food restaurant but alas there was no southern hospitality to be found and what is with the tea in PA I tell ya what it ain't like mama fixed it.",

My boyfriend and I ordered the fried chicken and blackened pork chop entrees.  The fried chicken was what u get if someone made homemade, nothing more nothing less.  My boyfriend said the blackened chops were good, but I'm not really into the blackened taste.  The mac and cheese was delicious!  We also had smashed potatoes, fried corn, cornbread dressing, cornbread and chicken and dumplings soup.  I'm pretty partial to my moms dressing so this one tasted on the sweeter side to me.  Overall it is good soul food and good people work there.  I'm eager to try it again and get a taste of other things.",

We had the smothered porkchops, fried chicken (dark meat), and catfish as our main dishes.  Each meal comes with a starter so we got salad, chicken' dumplings, and fish stew (a bit spicy).  Also all meals come with two sides and cornbread.  To say the least we were beyond full.  The sides we got were greens, yams, mac'n cheese, dressing (least favorite), smashed potatoes, fried corn (favorite).  Everything we ordered was nothing short of amazing.  I really should give 5 stars, never mind I changed to five stars from four stars.",

I ordered the fried chicken dinner with 2 sides.  I didn't think it was going to be enough food and it wasn't.  You could choose from a single breast, 3 wings or a leg and thigh.  None are quite enough.  I opted for the leg and thigh.  Mine were small to boot.  It was average, not great fried chicken but good.   I loved the greens, they were absolutely spot on great.  I didn't like the choice of sides and ended up with candied yams.  These had too much white sugar in them for me and they were broken all the way down.   It was sugar yam mush and I saved myself and didn't have more than a couple bites.    The staff is warm and friendly.  You are most welcome there and they are very concerned that you love your food and your experience.  They brought us out a free sample of their chicken and dumpling soup.  It was delicious.  Tasted and looked like liquid chicken pot pie in a cup with pieces of dumpling floating in it.  We had a nice time but ended up going to the strip for some tacos after as I was hungry.",

My fiance got chicken and waffles with a side of greens while I went with the smothered chicken with a side of mac n cheese, fried corn, and cornbread. The fried corn wasn't great to me, just a little bland. I added salt and hot sauce and was happy with it. The gravy on my chicken was amazing!!! I would eat that on anything! The only reason Carmi didn't get a 5 star is the service was a tad slow, but we did arrive right after the lunch rush so it's excusable. And though slow, the server was friendly as can be!",

We had made prior reservations which I would totally recommend since it is not a huge location, and gets quite busy. We had incredibly funny and friendly waitress. I ordered the punch which was quite large for the price, and delicious. My better half order the chicken and waffles. I ordered The fried chicken meal with the greens and mac & cheese as my sides. I also opted to try the chicken dumpling soup, because who orders a salad at a soul food restaurant? Our food was absolutely amazing! And they can definitely hold the claim of the best greens you've ever had! So why am I only getting four stars instead of five? We waited about an hour for our food. We were told this by the person who recommended the restaurant, but it's still a little disheartening to show up, smell all that amazing food, and wait an hour. We will definitely be back.",

While the service can be slow the friendly staff and excellent food is always there to make up for it and I have raved about it to my family and the circumstances finally got them there today for their first try.  Today was not the case. The service was extremely slow. Our orders were incorrect and the waiter was awful. There was another waitress who actually took our soup bowls away and refilled our drinks as our water continuously walked passed us without checking in with us. When speaking to the manager - she made it a point after I watched the waiter talk to her to walk beside our table and speak to two people, giving them hugs, asking for their Facebook page \"because I don't do Twitter\" and asking about when their next show was. When I shared how long we had been waiting she returned later and said \"I reviewed the camera you were wrong\" - so even if my perception of our arrival time was off - that still put us at waiting for our food 1 hr and 10 minutes after we had ordered it. Knowing service can be slow, I prepped my family in advance to order immediately since it can be a little while. The poor service was excused by \"he's new\" and \"our food took longer bc of what was ordered.\" - a 4 top behind us came longer after we had arrived and I saw they had also ordered chicken and were finishing heir meals as I as talking to the manager. Aside from the chicken I highly doubt they are baking fresh meatloaf for every single order. There is no reason it should take that long. I very rarely am one to ask to speak to a manager or send food back. This was so disappointing and the managers complete dismissal of our concerns/upset only made it worse and made the experience worse. Sadly I will certainly not be returning after today's experience and worse so- the manager could care less.",

In the hour in a half that we were there no one else even came into the restaurant.   It just breaks my heart that more people aren't dining here.  Yes the restaurant is easy to miss because it's still decorated like the Shamrock Inn and the Shamrock Inn signage still exists on the building.   Wow it just blows my mind that this place isn't more packed.  I have noticed that Carmi now has a people love us on Yelp sticker in their window and that makes me proud.  \\\\  My mom had the fried talipia, fish stew, candied yams and greens I had the blacked talipia and double greens with chicken and dumpling soup.  $35 for lunch the value for your money is the best in Pittsburgh hands down and we still had left overs to take home and banana pudding too.",

The chicken was really good, the mac n cheese.. I'm craving for more, and the stuffing was good but I do prefer mine more savory than sweet.   Only negatives with my visit is that when a friend gave cash for her food, the wait time for the hostess to go back and get change was incredibly long. However, the hostess was very friendly despite not apologizing for the wait. There were also people who left the restaurant because they felt like it took too long to have someone ask for their order and they were not offered water. This is not my experience but I felt that it was important to add in case this is common and I had an above average visit.   Summary: (-): wait (+): food, friendly service Would recommend? YES.",

The hostesses especially, and our waitress were awesome. The vibe was fun and the food was seriously amazing. The chicken and waffles was perfection after all of the other average or below, food we've had here. I'd definitely recommend this establishment to anyone near this area, the food and great staff here are worth it and the prices were good for college students like us. This photo was taken after a few bites, I couldn't resist!",

So the anticipation was very high as were my expectations!   I'll start with the food. The food was very good! Just what I expected from a soul food spot! I had the turkey ribs. I didn't even know turkey had ribs! But they were so good. The greens were good. Sweet. I've never had greens like that before. The green beans were good too! They're greens and green beans are cooked with turkey so that for me is perfect! The Mac and cheese is amazing!   I tried my coworkers shrimp and grits. They were good but had a layer of oil sitting on top of the bowl. I also tried the chicken and waffles! That's what I plan on getting next time!   Be warned that the service is very slow and it will take a while for you to get your food. There were a lot of people just calling in orders and picking them up! Also they charge like 50 cents to use cards. I hate when places do that!!!!!!!!  Other then that this place is great!",

    "text": "What you see is what you get.  The soul food at Carmi's is simple and comforting, and every dish we tried was packed with flavor.  We found this to be an ideal destination for weekend brunch.  At 11:30AM, we were able to sample the lunch menu and some brunchy house specialties.  CHICKEN & WAFFLES: typical fluffy waffle with a huge mound of butter and 2 small piece of fried chicken.  We went with the thigh and leg combination.  Nothing mindblowing, but it hit the spot.  We asked for smothered sauce for the chicken, and they provided it on the side.  SMOKED PORK RIBS: 1 large rib and 2 small came drenched in a sweet barbecue sauce, with tender meat, although the small end piece we received was on the dry side.  Although this was delicious, the smokiness was missing, and we preferred the ribs we tried at Showcase BBQ.  CHICKEN & DUMPLING SOUP: oh so creamy and savory and delicious, this was the highlight of the meal for me.  Tastes as you would expect--like salty chickeny crack.  Only downside was the lack of actual dumplings--the bowl was filled with starchy noodles instead.  Not untasty, but not the same.  I would have preferred more creamy broth.  FISH STEW: this had a nice kick to it.  An intensely flavorful, gloppy concoction studded with okra.  No complaints.  STUFFED CABBAGE AND BEEF SOUP (daily special): tasted like stuffed cabbage in a soup.  What can I say?  It was delicious.  Our mountain of food came out to $30 with tax.  This place is a gem.  Come here with someone you don't mind staring at across a tiny two-person booth.  Sit back and enjoy the comfort food.",

    "text": "I'm always on the lookout for awesome soul food passing through Pitt, I was so excited to try this place due to rave reviews.   There were only a few people when I got there around 2pm. The place was clean and cozy. I was seated right away although the girl at the cashier/counter could've smiled more. Not exactly the welcome I expected from a family place. My server, however, was very hospitable and helpful.   I ordered a dinner plate of fried chicken, with mac and cheese and mixed greens as my sides, with the standard cornbread and chicken and dumpling soup ($16.99). They had hits and misses- I definitely expected more.  1) Chicken and dumplings soup- 4/5 This arrived fairly quickly and it was underwhelming for a much hyped-about dish. There were only a few chicken chunks and the dumplings were overcooked. A+ for taste though.   2) Fried chicken- 5/5  Definitely one of the best-tasting fried chickens I've tried. Not too oily and the coating just adhering to the meat instead of smothering it. It was seasoned perfectly and was very tender, excellent brining job! I would suggest getting another part aside from the breast though, as the inner part can lack in flavor. The breast portion was HUGE. I could only finish half... and they served it with another piece (wing).  3) Cornbread- 2.5/5 Dry. Just had a few bites. Great flavor and huge portion though.  4) Mac and cheese- 2/5 I was so excited for this since people were claiming it to be \"one of the best\" if not THE best mac and cheese they've tried, but I found the taste to by cloying and the pasta very overcooked, making it a very lumpy and unattractive dish.  5) Mixed greens- 2/5 It was weirdly sweet. Nothing to write home about.   The saving grace of my experience here was the service. My server (too bad I didn't catch her name) had an easy smile and very friendly. Kudos to her!",

I haven't really tried their desserts yet so i have no comment on that.  The service there is pretty decent. We were seated after about a five minute wait.

They prepare their food with love, it is worth the time it takes to prepare. Relax and enjoy your company.   You will not leave hungry. The shrimp & grits is a huge portion of savory, cheddary goodness. It is good. But the show stopper is the chicken. Fried chicken, chicken and dumpling soup, greens, and corn bread. That is really all you need to die happy (and stuffed). The chicken is juicy and very flavorful.  (If you get the chicken breast, be warned, it takes quite a long time.) It is just feel good southern food.   A heads up, I hear they are going to be relocating to the South Side. It breaks my heart to lose this neighborhood gem.",

I find the dumplings kind of doughy whereas I prefer something light and fluffy. I have a friend who really likes their stuffed pork chops, but I think they're just okay, not the best thing on the menu. Their mac n' cheese is one of the cheesiest mac n' cheeses I've ever had. I wish their corn bread was more moist but it's still pretty good. Overall, would recommend.",

The server was very kind and brought us a sample of their delicious chicken and dumpling soup. The wait is a little longer than your average restaurant but it's well worth it! Your order is made when you order it NOT way in advance and reheated. Most of us got the chicken and waffles which were both absolutely amazing! The chicken was flavorful, not overcooked, and even for the breast I ordered it wasn't dry! Waffles were fluffy and had a hint of sweetness with an added touch of powdered sugar and butter. We all ordered sides of greens and Mac and cheese. Phenomenal!! The mixed greens were well prepared with a great taste of vinegar and even chunks of pork it was cooked down with. The Mac and cheese was to die for! Cheesy and delicious! We also had the cornbread which was so fluffy and moist it was almost like a cupcake!   Overall a great experience for my last day of work in Pittsburgh. I appreciate the server treating us like regulars and the chef for preparing a wonderful meal for all of us. I know for sure that everyone that was there will be returning and bringing newbies there to get hooked!",

The only thing that unnerved me - just a little - was the waitress asking if I wanted toast; it was breakfast, of course I wanted toast.  It wasn't until I got my bill that I noted the toast was extra.  Granted, it was only a $1, but if bread is gonna be extra - which is not typical - the waitress should usually mention that fact.",

The wings were very good, however the grits were extremely oily. My friend ordered shrimp and grits and her shrimp were inedible due to the amount of salt they were seasoned with. We informed the waitress just to let her know and told her we were not expecting it to be taken off the bill, however she said she would still tell the manager(owner) to come over and talk to us. We saw the waitress tell the owner twice and she just looked at us and never came. She even purposely got up and walked off once she saw we were about to leave out so she wouldn't have to acknowledge us. The only highlight was the very nice bus boy who came and offered to refill drinks and clear our table. Will probably never visit this place again.",

You go in wanting to love this place because its one of the only soul food places in Pittsburgh, but sadly I think thats one of the the things that helps it stay in business because it isn't the food. My food was lukewarm and the stuffed pork shop was bland. And to add insult to injury the restaurant would not honor my groupon the way it list on the website,  so I ended up having to pay even more for the food and the owner was not very pleasant. It's businesses like this that makes me want to stick to more established places as they have a proven track record that speaks to their quality. Next time I am craving soul food i'll just save myself money and disappointment and cook a meal for myself.",

I asked for no onions on the fish. I got the onions. It was pretty much cold. The bun was cheap and dry. I may have had one bad order from them.

Seriously, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. But if you absolutely cannot decide, I say you have to try the fried chicken, whether it's the dinner or the chicken and waffles. They season the chicken to perfection and the batter is crispy, yet light and the meat is oh so moist. The sides are magical, particularly the candied yams and mixed greens (kale and collard). Not to mention the chicken and dumpling soup, which is comfort in a bowl. When you're in need of some good, stick to your ribs, comfort food, you have to come here.   Now, the space isn't fancy but the food makes up for it. As soon as you take a bite of the food, it will transport you to a warm place so you won't even notice the lack of decor here. There is definitely a warm feeling you get when dining here, like you're being taken care of by a loving grandmother. I don't even know how else to describe it.   I absolutely love this place and have not had anything I didn't like!",

Most of the wait staff are young teens and they just haven't been all that great the last few visits.  We were deciding on where to eat and my bf suggested Carmi's. There's no way ever I could say no to that so we left and headed to north side.  We were seated immediately. We looked over menus and decided what we wanted to order. No one greeted us or even offered drinks. After almost 15 minutes and no sign of our server, another server said 'she'll be out shortly' . Meanwhile a group of 4 other servers stood in the back staring at the dining room and even they didn't offer to greet us. How upsetting. I've been a server and understand sometimes someone is behind.. But other servers who clearly have nothing to do normally offer to help.. Atleast EVERYWHERE I've worked.   My boyfriend ordered his normal chicken Entree with mac & green. He chose the chicken and dumpling soup which is still phenomenal omg!  I ordered the shrimp and grits trying to be on the healthy side. I also ordered a side salad. I wouldn't call their shrimp and cheddar grits healthy but they were great as well! I do wish more shrimp was in it though. My drink wasn't always filled through the meal though.   Despite the really crappy service we are still in love with Carmi. I'll give them another chance for sure but I hope the servers can be more attentive and helpful.",

The prices aren't very reasonable either. Honestly, you could get just as good if not better fried chicken from a Giant Eagle\\fast food place for half the price. I do recommend the fish stew however. The fries are bad. Staff is friendly though. Takes a while to get your food too.",

    "text": "Friend and I ordered late lunch, early dinner to go on a Wednesday. We had JUST missed the lunch specials that end at 3pm, so dinner orders it was. I ordered the fried chicken dinner, which came with two sides and a choice of soup or salad. I elected for the chicken dumpling soup option as opposed to the other fish stew, and also the green bean and mac n' cheese sides. Friend order fish n' grits dinner, which also came with two sides. No soup or salad, I think though.  I was so hungry, I started in on the cornbread and soup first while in the car. Cornbread was not great. The top part was dry, but the bottom was alright. We're thinking we didn't get the freshest of cuts from the day. Next, I started in on the chicken n' dumpling soup. Though it was so thick, I don't know how it could be called soup! Don't get me wrong, it was DELICIOUS, but it was super thick and creamy, far more than I expected. There's some word between soup and stew that accurately describes it.  Finally after reaching the house, I started to eat the dinner meal like proper folks should. Green beans were overcooked as typical in most soul food spots I've experienced. Mac n' Cheese was alright, but not best I ever had. The fried chicken was hardly fried. It was kind of a lightly fried baked chicken that retained a lot of the juices. It didn't have much of the crisp and crunch that I was looking for, but it was quite good for what it was. My friend said pretty much the same thing about his meal. Everything tasted light. Take that to mean whatever you'd like.  It's hard to please everyone when it comes to soul food. Certainly this food was aight, and didn't leave my stomach crying in overstuffed pain later. But it was a wee disappointing. Not to mention that they didn't have any desserts for sale when we came in because apparently the baker doesn't get in to get those ready until the the dinner rush. I really REALLY wanted me some good sweet potato pie, and was sad I couldn't try out Carmi's.",

The waitstaff is super friendly and the portions are generous. I never leave here unhappy, and I've made this restaurant my go-to for my birthday dinner because nothing makes me feel better about getting older quite like some chicken and waffles that are so good, you swear your own grandmother is making them for you.  I cannot recommend this place enough. I tell everyone I know to come here. Even friends of mine who are more health conscious have made exceptions to come here and indulge in the fried chicken.

Cooked and flavored just right for me. Definitely good enough for me to go back and eating as is with no sauce(or no waffles). My only regret was not having more of it to eat.  The waffle was also good. Had the right amount of crispy and soft to it for me and the butter and powdered sugar really added to the taste.  Food took a little longer than I would have expected, but they had a note up on their tables explaining that they care about the taste of what they're cooking and aren't going to rush it. I was a little surprised by this because my group came in with only one other group already in the place since we got there very early on a Sunday morning. Definitely able to tell that they put the time into the food and it made the wait well worth it since it tasted perfect.  I consider myself to be a big chicken and waffles fan and I'd come away saying that they either have the best or second best in Pittsburgh.  Service was good and it was nice inside- bigger than I expected from just looking at the outside.  No question I would return again. Maybe not if I was in a hurry, but it's a place I really enjoyed. I would love to come back at a later time and try the dinner menu for sure.",

The wait for our food was longer than we are used to, but there was a sign that says food is cooked when ordered so it may take longer. The wait was completely worth it!!!  I can't even express how much I love the chicken and waffles. It's an unhealthy obsession. The breading on the chicken was light, crispy, and extremely flavorful. The actual chicken was so moist. The waffle.. Omg. Thick, crispy, and sweet. Un-believable! It was the best thing I've ever eaten!  The mac and cheese? Delicious! Super cheesy and homemade - just like it should be!   The prices were incredible for the amount of food you get! The ambiance was diner-ish and dim, but the staff was friendly and on-point. We will definitely be back. And soon!",

The 1st table we went to sit at wasn't cleaned and had hair on it.   We waited and waited... that pretty much sums up the whole experience...  after about an hour our server comes out and says they lost the order ticket. She proceeded to take out order again and assured us it would only 10 more min... it wasn't and just about when we were gathering up our stuff to leave here comes our food. While we were waiting I watched them seat people at the table with hair never wiping it off  or any other table for that matter before seating people. So when our food came I really didn't want it... I ate the mac n cheese .. I was so hungry and it was good... the chicken was tasted boiled and the sauce on it runny.. the yams were too sweet. We asked for the check and I was a bit surprised that they hadn't taken any thing off or even seemed apologetic considering the entire thing was a 2 hour disappointment.",

I got the smother fried chicken and my fiance got the smothered pork chops. Each entree came with two sides so we shared the Mac n cheese, potato salad, greens and green beans.   Oh. My. God. The GRAVY.   As soon as I took a bite of the chicken with the gravy, I asked if I could take a bath in the gravy. Seriously. That good.   The chicken was so moist and my fiance ate all three (yes three) of his pork chops. All of the sides were solid. We hardly had any leftovers.   It was like being at the best family reunion I've ever been too.   We are already planning our next visit for my dad's birthday.",

The waffle was so good - it tasted like fried dough. The Mac and cheese was also really tasty, the grits were good but needed a little bit of salt. I would definitely return - the chicken is killer!",

    "text": "They made my PostMates driver wait 45 minutes for order. When it finally did make it to me, nearly an hour and a half after my order was placed, it was pretty mediocre. Looked like they took one of their crappiest chicken breasts and just threw it on top. The waffle was good, but came with no sauce or anything. And the spicy corn was also nothing special. I took one bite of the way too vinegary corn and tossed it.   If I made somebody wait that long for food, I would have thrown in a freebie, an apology note or something . . . anything.   Maybe the dining experience is better but there's no way I'm going to go out of my way to give them my business. Which is a shame because I PostMate a lot and could have become their regular customer. Ah well.   Yup. Really, really disappointed. But then what should I expect from the crappy food scene in Pittsburgh. So not a foodie city. No matter what the PR machines say.",

Their music choices should be quite a bit more eclectic - not pandering to \"one type\" of crowd... Also, they were out of desert!??! UN AC CEP TABLE!!!!! The Cheesecake Factory is right down the street! If you \"run out\" of desert you better find a popular substitute and make up a \"Reserve Desert Menue\" (albeit limited to 2 or 3 options)! If your creative you can 'dress it up' and \"make it yours\"! My new \"soul food wife\" was a fantastic waitress. She'll anyways get decent tips from me! The shrimp and grits... Need more seasoning or something for the grits but they were still Double Dope!! The sweet potatoes.... Maaannnnn....... I'll \" \"SlapDaMamma\"!!!! They should probably expand the bar give bigger portions of salmon and give me free food and the phone number of my first waitress! If I get one out of four, dat ain't bad  ....hmmm.. Maybe I'll get the \"free food\"",

My boyfriend ordered the Barbeque spare ribs with cornbread fries and macaroni and cheese. I had the chicken and waffles. I have been on the hunt for the best chicken and waffles in the city and I believe I've found them. Boyfriend loved the ribs and said they were tender and meaty. All his sides were delicious as well (I tried all of them) We also shared a bowl of the fish stew. That was a standout of the meal and we couldn't stop eating it ha.  The ingredients were fresh and made to order so it does take a little bit for the food to arrive although we would have waited longer for the delicious meal we received.

Food took forever and my bill was incorrect since I only ordered appetizers the bill wasn't expensive just incorrect.  Some items ordered I never received.  Nice local place where I saw folks leaving unhappy.  Will I return.  Sure if I'm not in a hurry.  My advise. Try it since the food was pretty good.

    "text": "Why was last weekend the first time that I went to this place? I cannot believe that after hearing about Carmi's for so long we finally took the plunge. Now I will say that even though I live in Pittsburgh I am not a football fan. I do not really get into the games or all that that means. So when we got here on a Steeler sunday when they were playing in Pittsburgh I didn't realize that street parking would be an issue. If the Steelers play you cannot park for over an hour on the street in the Northside. It is an $120 fine. I mean.. that seems a little much but I get that they do not want people to park there and then head to the stadium, but what about the people who come there and are going to eat? I don't know, but it seems like there should be a better procedure in place.  What was good is that this ticketing doesn't happen until after 12PM. So we got there around 10 AM for breakfast so we were in the clear. I will say that Carmi's does take time to get your food because they make everything by hand, so while we were ok, we did cut it a little closer than I would have liked. But still totally worth it.   So we got there and picked Carmi's because my cousin wanted chicken and waffles. That is what she was craving and since she was visiting she was going to get what she wanted! We got in and the hostess greeted us warmly right at the door. We got to sit in one of the booths on the side and the waitresses and waiters all checked on us throughout the entire visit. I thought that this was really special. I liked that when they walked past they would just check in. Really a nice way to enjoy breakfast and not have to look for someone if there was something needed for the table.   We decided that we wanted to split breakfast which meant that we each ordered something that looked amazing. She got the chicken and waffles and I got the Carmi omelet. We wanted something sweet, something eggy, and something filling. And boy, with this order did we get it all! Again, if you are in the hurry this place is probably not the place for you. But if you have some time to kill and to enjoy the company you are with this is a great place.   Once our food came it was just silence. We ate so much and did not leave anything on our plates. I mean it was just so good. The chicken was breaded to perfection and just seasoned superbly. I could have just had that chicken for sure, it was just really good. The waffle was crispy and sweet. And everything on that plate was wonderful. My omelet was fluffy and filled with green peppers, onions, and meat. I will say that on my half of the omelet I only got one hunk of cheese but it did not distract from the omelet experience at all. I got to also pick my own toast and that was pre-buttered and crisp. YUM.   I really enjoyed this place a lot. I want to come back again soon! And maybe even for dinner. I would have also liked to be able to stay a little longer but with that sign up saying that I would get a ticket I was slightly on edge to stay longer to get a cup of coffee and chill. I would suggest if you are in the Northside to take the time out of your day to come here. You will not be disappointed.",

The chicken was good. It came with corn bread, gravy, chicken and dumpling soup, mashed potatoes.  Gravy and corn bread were so extremely salty it started to burn my mouth. I also pulled a dark hair out of my potatoes. We were told we had to sit at the bar because the tables were for reservations. We were there an hour and half, there were 4 tables available the entire time.  I was excited to go there but did not feel welcome at all. The staff was unfriendly no smiles,  no kindness shown to us. Food took about 30 minutes to come after ordering. Basically low grade cafeteria food.",

For 10.99  you can get fried chicken, 2 sides, cornbread and a soup! That is a DEAL!   The chicken was perfectly fried and moist inside. Real Deal Holyfield right there. My sides were the yams (delicious!) and collard greens. The collard greens were very tasty, and rapidly becoming a favorite of mine. I will say they were slightly on the salty side however.  Cornbread was also moist and tasty. I ordered the  fish stew to get the full experience out of this, and I have never had something like that before. It had a full flavor, somewhat similar to a gumbo, though like the  greens, a little on the salty side.   Still, for the price, you cant beat it.",

    "text": "At the end of the Thanksgiving weekend most people probably want to take a step back from the table and reassess their diet for the next few weeks prior to Christmas.  Some may refer to them as intelligent, healthy, skinny, etc... I, however, like to call those people \"amateurs.\"  A trip to Carmi's is about one thing... the food.  This is not about the lack of decor, the dim lighting, or the inconspicuous entrance at the darker end of Western Avenue.  It's about finding a place to sit down on a brisk Saturday night and be comforted by a warm soul food blanket.  Although the menu is somewhat limited, the items selected were done well.  I couldn't help but head straight into the deep end and get the chicken and waffles... besides, what's one more dead bird to the population?  The menu options are for a breast, 3 full size wings, or one leg and thigh.  The way I see it, one needs to consume all parts of the bird - most of them, anyways - in order to fully experience the quality of the overall product.  Naturally, I ordered the chicken breast with an additional thigh and leg.  As it did not come with a side, I felt obligated to order myself some mac and cheese.  It's just an unwritten rule in this type of establishment that you try it, no matter what.  The waitress was nice, helpful, and attentive... and also informed us that it would be up to a 20 minute wait for the fried chicken breasts.  I'm willing to wait for [potentially] great things, so this was of no issue.  The fried chicken was a deep golden brown with a crisp skin, generously salted and lightly peppered, just as it should be.  Instead of a heavy floured crust, this was done with a thin batter... just enough to hold on to the meat and provide a great texture contrast while still maintaining the moisture inside.  The waffle was evenly browned with a slight crisp on the exterior, concealing the sweet malty pillow tucked inside.  The hot sauce, which was in the range of Red Devil or Crystal, rounded out the flavor of the chicken while complimenting the heavy drizzle of maple syrup flowing through the waffle's crevices.  The macaroni and cheese is very straightforward and that's what makes it so great.  The technique of making mac and cheese could start a world war, but I don't discriminate.  Baked and dry, not baked and excessively creamy, processed cheese product, mornay base, aged or young shredded... I don't care.  Just give it to me - preferably in mass quantity.  A noticeable texture strata of brown and bubbly to soft and stringy cheese will only earn you more points.  This one in particular is more along the lines of the oven baked variety with a lightly browned top, noodles cooked beyond the point of tender, heaped into a bowl without regard for delicate presentation.  No secrets, no frills, just a great bowl of mac and cheese.  Hell, it didn't even need bacon. *gasp*  While straddling the boundaries of yet another holiday food coma, our waitress was just in time to ask if we wanted dessert.  I didn't know what they had to offer, but I know exactly what I wanted if indeed it were an option, regardless if it could be fully consumed or not.  Sure enough, those words flowed from her mouth: \"We have banana pudding.\"  YES. There would be no turning back.  We sat and waited, unknowing of what was about to hit our table.  She approached with what appeared to be a bowl size comparable to that of a baptismal basin - not the one the old ladies dip their gnarled fingers in - the one that a small child could be dumped in to wash him of his \"sins\", or chicken greased fingers in this case.  A mountain of banana pudding, hints of vanilla, layered with whipped cream and crushed 'Nilla wafers, overflowing with freshly sliced ripe bananas.  I've had some banana pudding in my day... but this was near the top of the list.  Once again it was simplicity at its finest, with ingredients none too spectacular, but handled with enough care to create a dish that transports you straight into grandma's kitchen.  A great first trip for someone who loves and appreciates soul food.  I can only hope everyone else has the same experience.",

    "text": "I would rate the food 5 stars (hands down).....but that's not all that comes with a running a business, UNFORTUNATELY!!! I went with my friend (we are CAUCASIAN) and our three kids (two 3 year olds and a 20 month old). WORST place to be with kids, NOT A FAMILY ORIENTED PLACE AT ALL( IF YOU HAVE KIDS)! Our kids are well disciplined, mind you but we were seated first and it took 20 minutes or so before the waitress even brought over crayons or even acknowledged we had kids and their needs. We came from the Children's Museum so the kids were starving to say the least. I ask the waitress to bring some crackers until the food came and she told me I would have to wait since they were busy (there were  only a few tables occupied mind you). I had to ask three different waitress's for crackers before we even seen our first pack. I asked for extra napkins for the kids and again had to ask the hostess and 3 waitress's for extra napkins, they gave us two napkins for a table of 5 (with three kids mind you)!  We arrived there at 515pm and did not get out of this miserable place until 645pm. When we were seated the waitress did not give us her name but the family that was seated next to us and after us (who were African American mind you) was greeted in a cheerful tone and gave this family her name..lol..we couldn't believe it!!!! In an hour and a half we seen our waitress twice and only had the opportunity to refill our drinks twice (in 1 1/2hrs of waiting)!   I asked to speak with the Manager (Carla) and I expressed our concerns with the kids and the ATTITUDES AND UNFRIENDLYNESS STAFF and all she could care about was the food. This was the ABSOLUTE WORST RESTURAUNT TO BE IN (if you have kids) and by far THE WORST AND I MEAN WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE! Wait, the funny thing about this was as we were waiting on our bill to come (took about 40 minutes or so from the time we were done eating) we heard the families around us complaining about orders being messed up and how long it was taking to get extra things they needed at their tables!!!   I usually do not write reviews, but definitely felt the need to do a review for this place. Again, food was good (a bit pricey) but NOT WORTH ANOTHER VISIT! THERE ARE OTHER GOOD SOUL FOOD REST IN DA BRG that have good food and great customer service!",

    "text": "I had originally heard of Carmi's though a Groupon that I purchased several months ago.  Because it's slightly out of the way of my usual stomping grounds and quite frankly, some parts of the North Side can be rather scary, I had put off going there.  Yesterday as my PIC (Partner In Cuisine) and I found ourselves heading in the direction of the North Side, we decided to finally use the Groupon.  As it turns out, Carmis is on a lovely little street on the far end of a nice park in the heart of urban revitalization.  Not nearly as scary as the news makes the area out to be!  My first impression of the place was that the decor was rather dated and the restaurant itself was completely empty so I was bit nervous about eating there, but I was determined to use that Groupon.  We were greeted and seated at one of the many booths by a very friendly young lady named Margaret, who also happened to be our server.  Both my PIC and I ordered the ribs meal after much deliberation over their extensive menu.  With the meals, we each got a soup or salad, two sides and a VERY generous portion of homemade corn bread.  For my starter, I got the chicken and dumplings soup and my PIC got the salad.  The soup was rich and delicious, but the salad left something to be desired (and only two dressing options).  Our main courses consisted of fries, greens, and candied yams along with three spare ribs.  The greens and yams were both homemade and excellent, but the fries were just typical frozen variety (not bad, not great).  I was a bit worried when the ribs came because there were only three and ribs aren't that meaty, but my worries were proven unfounded as I was unable to finish my last rib.  The sauce on the ribs was sweet and tangy and the meat was cooked to perfections, but the ribs themselves were a bit gristly.  The cornbread was buttery, sweet, and overall full of awesomeness.  Margaret made the entire experience exceptional by providing good conversation and suggestions for what we should order.  As far as the restaurant being empty, by the end of our meal, about six tables ended up filling and more people were coming in as we left.    Ultimately, I'd give Carmis a 4 1/2 out of 5 if Yelp would allow that because while the prices were acceptable and the sides were superb, the salad and meat weren't the best I've had.  After we left, we walked around the area for a bit and as it turns out, Carmi's is extremely close to Heinz Field so if you find yourself in the area for a game, I'd suggest giving it a go...even without a Groupon.",

    "text": "This was my fourth visit to Carmi's and I have to say after the horrible service, wait for our food, and attitude from our waitress I will never go back. Like others have posted on UrbanSpoon, Google reviews, and Facebook, the silverware, cups, and dishes are filthy. When we arrived there were two 2-seat booths filled and one table of two. We placed our order for the fried chicken and the other tables vacated but another 2-person booth was filled behind us and then a larger booth with 4 people both of which ordered them same meals as us. In fact, the 2-person booth behind us order EXACTLY the same as us and we laughed but that laughter stopped when their food came out immediately and they were out the door before our meals even arrived. Our waitress was downright rude to us as well. When our order finally came, only my cousin's chicken dinner arrived and the waitress who brought out our meals (not our original) looked at me like I had two heads when I asked where mine was. So then we had to wait for my meal to come out. We also order ONE dish to go and they gave us TWO of those without the accompanying side dish (we decided it wasn't worth fighting over it to get it taken off and knew that we would just each take our own home instead), anyhow, when I asked about the accompanying side to go with it, our original waitress shot me a dirty look, rolled her eyes and acted like I was inconveniencing HER! Never again. As I saw one reviewer state on a FB review - your customers ARE what will keep you in business but you won't have any if you treat them like they are not welcome",

    "text": "I was highly disappointed in this restaurant. Based on the positive reviews here on Yelp, my wife and I stopped here last Friday for a late lunch (1:20 p.m.). We both had chicken:  me the chicken (breast) and waffles, she the chicken (breast) with 2 sides. We were seated immediately, and the server was very pleasant. After ordering, we waited 35 minutes for our meals (a bit too long, in my opinion, but hey, I'm thinking I'm waiting on SW Pa's best chicken, according to Yelpers, so it'll be worth it). Finally our food arrived. My wife's salad and side (fried corn) were good.  The waffle was good.  I was expecting some type of homemade sauce/gravy with the waffle.  Nope.  The chicken and waffles, as served, consisted of a chicken breast and a Belgian waffle with a sparse sprinkling of powdered sugar.  The pancake syrup is on the table. Speaking of the fried chicken, the 2 fried chicken breasts we were served ranked very high amongst the WORST we have ever had.  Not very much meat on them, and on the dry side.  One would think after waiting 35 minutes, the restaurant would have the decency to serve us a freshly breaded, freshly fried piece of chicken.  I got the impression we were both served chicken left over from the earlier lunch crowd.  A takeout chicken breast from Giant Eagle would put these 2 poor excuses for fried chicken to shame. Next time I want chicken & waffles, I'll stop at the Iggle for a piece of takeout, and eat it at home with a homemade Belgian waffle.",

I'm lucky I live far away from Carmi's, or the south in general, otherwise I'd weigh a million pounds.   Pros: The food is the real deal. Excellent soul food at reasonable prices, made to order. And they're honest about their shortcomings, like telling us there will be about a 20 minute wait for the food to cook, or that there's a 0.25 fee for using cards, which is reasonable.  Cons: Come on, guys. You're getting rave reviews, you're in a cute neighborhood. Put some new booths in there, put some paint on the walls, some new lighting fixtures. Also, the staff is friendly and well-meaning but awkward. That's just something that comes with training and time.",

Now you have to like spicy because these things are major spicy, but oh my, were they delicious.  My husband said the cornbread was great with just the right amount of sweet. It looked great--a huge think chunk of goodness.  My daughter had the \"prince\"--which we called the \"princess\"--it was the perfect amount of food for her.

    "text": "I was looking forward to eating here ever since learning they opened in my neighborhood.  It was possibly the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  We arrived at 7:05 on a Saturday night, fully expecting there to be a wait. I don't mind waiting. This went beyond that.  7:10 Server asked us if we were eating in. We said yes. The dining room was only about 60% full. A lady came from the back to inform us that there was a half hour wait for a table. We were a little confused, since there were sooo many tables open, but said of course we could wait. She looked REALLY put out that we chose to wait, even though it was 2 hours before closing. The server sat us in a booth, and asked us if we would like some water. We asked if we could have a coke? She brought them to us.  7:35 Server took our order. One of our meals was supposed to come with a salad, which is usually served first.  8:05 Server asked to take our order. We told her we had already given it. Still no salad.  8:30 Lady who told us there was a wait asked to take our order. We told her we put it in an hour before and could we just get it to go? She actually grabbed a sign that was facing away from us and showed it to us; it said that it takes a half hour for food to be ready. Then she said, \"and I told you it was a half hour wait to get a table.\" We were shocked. We had already been there nearly an hour and a half, and while definitely put out, we hadn't even complained. We wanted it to go so we could take it home because we had been there long enough and were tired. She said she would pack up our food to go, including salad and desert.  8:45 Our food was brought out. We paid and left. I have to say it was a very degrading experience and we will never go there again. I understand that they may be understaffed, but how is it customer service to behave as we are being unreasonable because we have been waiting an hour and a half and want to take our food to go? The showing us the sign was a huge insult. I know how to tell time. I knew exactly how long we had been there. Good customer service is apologizing for the wait and giving a good excuse for it. The kitchen being a half hour backed up is no excuse for it being 1 hr 45 mins before our food arrived.  We never got the salad. It wasn't in the to-go food. I cannot recommend this restaurant. I'm sure they are very nice when they have under 10 customers, but they do not have the capability to handle a half full dining room on a Saturday night. The food was ok. I'm sure it would have been delicious when fresh.",

The chicken & dumpling soup was easily the best I've had in a while and I'd go back just for their fish stew.  The candied yams and rice & beans were less exciting, however, and the desserts are for sure worth skipping  But man, what a lot of good food you get with a dinner entree.   You definitely can't complain about the food or the pricing, but the room is really ugly and the lighting is a disaster, they have super bright energy saving bulbs in these low hanging lamps over each table that make you feel like you're in an interrogation room, and the service is slowwwww-perfectly friendly but slowww.  I feel like some of the servers just have no idea what is expected of them from the customer stand-point as far as setting the table, checking on drinks and making sure you have been served all the many sides you picked out in the beginning.   Overall not a bad experience, especially since they keep posting groupons for dinners for four for around 30 bucks!

It was also the first time I didn't get the chicken & waffles and a side of cheesy grits (which, by the way, I LOVE. Like, want to marry it love).  So anyway, I really wanted to eat fried chicken, but I had just eaten fried chicken at a less desirable place for lunch (boo), so I decided to give the ribs a try. So, when you get an entree, you get either soup or salad, plus two sides and a big slab of cornbread.  I got the chicken & dumpling soup which was very, very tasty. For the sides, I chose the sweet potato fries and the mac & cheese. Um, the mac and cheese was THE. BOMB. For real. So good. I will say that I did not much like the sweet potato fries, but I felt like maybe it was just an off night for them - there were some in the basket that were really good, but most of them seemed underdone.  The cornbread? DELISH. I love cornbread and usually get it anywhere that it's available and this did not disappoint.  The ribs were also super good. Meaty and falling off the bone delicious.   If you haven't been there. GO. Go for breakfast. Get the chicken and waffles. Eat cheesy grits. GO for lunch or dinner. Get the mac and cheese. Your life will be better for it. Seriously.",

Since the other place also happened to be my favorite restaurant we figured that we would give Carmi's a try.  The entrance to this place is pretty inconspicuous and I am not sure that I would have ever noticed it while walking on the sidewalk if not for the chalkboard stand outside.  Once inside I noticed nothing special about the place with a bunch of booths on each side of the restaurant and tables down the middle.  Whenever we got there at around 1 or so the place was fairly full and it only got more full the longer that we were there.  After looking at the menu I was having a hard deciding between the shrimp and grits and other meals whenever my girlfriend made it easy by also being undecided.  We ultimately decided that we would split a shrimp and grits as well as BBQ Chicken Breast Dinner with sides of macaroni and cheese and the southern mixed greens.  My girlfriends father ordered the Southern Fried Chicken Meal with the breast as his choice and we were told that would take between 20-25 minutes.  Since we were not in a huge hurry that was not a big deal.  I was impressed that all of the entrees were served with 2 sides in addition to a soup or salad.  After a bit of a wait all of our meals arrived.  My shrimp and grits looked awesome except for the amount of grease that seemed to be with it.  As a matter of a fact most of the food was fairly greasy but it still tasted really good.  The shrimp and grits were excellent with the shrimp being cooked nicely and the cheesy grits tasting fantastically.  I also was impressed with the mac n cheese which had some excellent taste and a good amount of cheese.  Finally both the chicken breast and the greens were good as well.   The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  All of the food that we had was really good, now if I could only get it a little less greasy then I would be happy.",

Lucky for us we were among the first few tables in the restaurant, because around noon every single table was filled!  I had the grilled stuffed chicken breast with candied yams. The chicken and yams were great! The stuffing I wasn't crazy about, but it did not ruin the dish. The cornbread was so sweet and terrific, a perfect compliment. The real winner for me was the chicken and dumpling soup.  I love the addition of so many veggies, and the soulful flavors!  I will definitely be back again!",

It's a little pricey but good and the staff is very very nice. I have nothing negative about this place. Only downfall is a chicken takes awhile to cook but you know you getting something fresh on your plate and not sitting under a heat lamp waiting to be served",

I ordered the grilled tilapia with sides of sweet potato fries and mixed greens. My boyfriend got a fried chicken breast with cornbread stuffing and mashed potatoes.   The fish and chicken were cooked well. Tender, well flavored, and a crispy skin on the chicken. I enjoyed my sweet potato fries a lot. They were crispy outside, soft inside, and perfectly seasoned (that is to say, barely seasoned ;) ). However, the greens were too salty for me. I forced myself to eat them because they were the only vegetables I'd have for the meal. My boyfriend's sides were good but not outstanding.   We left the restaurant feeling stuffed (and I'd been pretty hungry beforehand). Overall, a nice lunch. I wouldn't mind going back again, but I'm definitely getting sweet potato fries!",

I gave it several tries just to see if I was catching them on an off day, and each time it was just mediocre.  The wings are pretty tasty though, but the gravy has too much garlic powder, the mac n cheese taste like its made with velveeta and not actual sharp cheddar cheese, and the service is lackluster.  Not to mention you are charged a small fee for paying with a card, whether its credit or debit even though their posted sign sayd credit card.  For the price of the food, that fee should be calculated in their and not on top of your final bill.",

The marketing for Carmi's says \"the best Soulfood in Pittsburgh\" now this is my first time in Pitt, but I'll bet this is the truth!! The food was absolutely mouth watering! I ordered the lunch option of catfish w/a side of sweet potato fries and mixed greens. I asked for the catfish crispy, which was delivered and the fries had a sprinkle of cinnamon which is missing when most folks prepare sweet potato fries (Thanks for the person that indicated this in their review), the greens were mixed with Kale (a bit diff) mustards and collards w/turkey (always a plus). They have a full bar, so I also Indulged in the TN sweet tea! My 4 colleagues enjoyed their meals as well, one was new to soul food and throughly enjoyed her chicken/waffles; the waffles were a bit \"light\" to me; but they enjoyed it!   The wait was a bit; but it was 100%worth it!  If I ever make it back to Pitt, I'll definitely go back to try the shrimp n grits!",

I figured maybe since they were already an established restaurant there may not be too many kinks to work out and decided to go a month after opening (usually I wait a bit after a restaurant opens to give a good review). Our waitress was a sweetheart, and the food was pretty much the same. However in the hour or so I was there I watched MULTIPLE people leave after being told 15-20 mins and seeing empty tables just not be filled. The young girl at the front was so uninviting. Not that she was mean, but just seemed annoyed the whole time. She seemed to just be moving extremely slow, like she just didn't know if she should seat someone or take a takeout order or what. She was very young so I don't want this to come off as rude, it just all seemed confused.   Also, I miss the comfort vibe. There was music playing sporadically but when it would shut off, the place went SILENT.   Our food came in a reasonable amount of time. My chicken was a bit tough compared to what I'm used to from them, but sides were delicious as usual.   I can't abandon my Carmi love, I'll just give it a while before I try again.",

Let me start off by saying that I rarely give a place 5 stars - this was well deserved.   The feel of the restaurant is great - it's super homey and our server made us feel really welcome. The food might take a little while but that's because they make it to order and they note that on their tables. Trust me, it's worth the wait. Also, it's BYOB but they're moving to South Side in a few weeks and stated they would be serving alcohol there.   I decided to get the smothered chicken with fries and mac and cheese - couldn't hold back on the carbs! So glad I didn't. The fries were super fresh and the mac and cheese was the best I've ever had. Trust me, I've tasted a lot of mac in my life but that was the top. The chicken was definitely in my top 5 favorites. The breading wasn't super thick but definitely gave a good crunch and the breast was very juicy.  My friend got the chicken and waffle with mac and cheese and raved about it. We were both so impressed and wish we saved room for dessert because I'm sure they had something awesome to offer. We will have to save room next time!   We definitely plan on visiting the South Side location when it opens and can't wait to see how well it does.",

A bit too close to the door though, every time the door opened I was reminded that we were in Pittsburgh in the winter time LOL. Now on to the food, FANTASTIC! The meal comes with your choice of soul or salad. A friend recommended the chicken and dumplings soup. It was amazing with the perfect amount of creaminess. For my entree I chose the fried catfish, mac and cheese, and fried corn dinner. The mac & cheese was so cheesy and delicious, they definitely got it right. That fried corn was heaven! I made sure not to leave a kernel in the bowl. My fish was fried to my specifications and was perfectly seasoned. The cornbread was delicious as well. The sweet tea I ordered did not taste homemade, I think that would be my only regret. Service was good considering how crowded it was. I definitely recommend Carmi during your travels to Pittsburgh.",

Went here yesterday -- the fried chicken - amazing, the mac n cheese up to par, the grits with cheese - delish, the cat fish yummy.  But the \"piece de resistance\" -- the greens were not Carmi worthy.  I was crushed with that first bite laced with way too much sweet.  I am a believer  that the seasoning of the greens is important -- but the sweetening thereof is the responsibility of the consumer.  I have had their greens before and don't remember them being that sweet.  They looked so inviting, so delicious but they were too sweet.  I am so sorry Carmi for taking away a star ---  but I have to be True to myself.",

However the yams, greens, cornbread and fish soup were pretty good! Many dishes seemed to be on the sweet side.   Our group of 12 ordered many dishes and were generally pleased but def not blown away. Overall a solid choice.",

I ordered the shrimp and grits and my girlfriend got the chicken and waffles.   The food came out in a reasonable amount of time. The shrimp and grits were a little greasy for me. The Cajun seasoning was great! There was a good amount of cheese as well. That being said there was way too much fennel in the dish. That's all I could taste in most bites.   The chicken and waffles is what I'd go back for. The chicken was so crispy and really juicy. The waffle was perfectly golden brown. The two complimented each other so well!   Our waitress was so polite and sweet to us the entire time. I felt like I was at home and I cant wait to go back.   I would have given 4 our of 5 but the staff was so welcoming they deserved 5 out of 5!",

I am not someone who will typically order ribs at a restaurant. Ribs need to fulfill a lot of requirements for me, so I usually don't take the risk. I'm glad I made the choice for the ribs. They were so tender I could cut them with my fork! The meat fell right off of the bone and the BBQ sauce was perfect St. Louis style with just enough tang and sweetness.   If you get the chance, also give the sweet potato fries a try. Thick, fresh-cut and perfectly cooked topped with brown sugar and a dash of cinnamon.   The food here is just like home-cooked and just as comforting. Everything I've had at Carmi's is delicious and it's hard deciding what to order! No matter what you choose, you can't go wrong.   We had fantastic service and everyone was very friendly and welcoming. Carmi's will keep us coming back for sure!  Some of the reviews about the food taking a while bug me. There is a sign in the restaurant that clearly states that everything is made to order and can take up to 30 mintues to prepare.Don't be in a rush and just enjoy!",

We were greeted immediately and seated. Both the hostess and waitress were nice and welcoming.

I've never had chicken and waffles and the first thought of them actually wasn't to appetizing.   The wait for the food was a bit long, but it is cooked to order which I love. Fresh! It was totally worth the wait, because once I took the first bite I was in HEAVEN. How can two opposite foods blend so nicely? I don't even care. I left and my belly was full.

OMG, I sorry that I don't live in Pittsburgh, so that I could eat here more often!  The Yelp reviews were spot on!   The restaurant is very unassuming, had I not seen the reviews, I never would have given this place a second thought.  The exterior and interior decor don't give this place the credit it deserves.  Don't get me wrong, the place was spotless, the decor was just dated and a bit dark as other reviewers have stated, but nevertheless, I would return over and over again.  I ordered the stuffed pork chop entree, which came with soup or salad, (I chose soup), 1 side, I chose greens and also ordered a separate side of the mac n' cheese that all of the reviews raved about.  The chicken dumpling soup was EXCELLENT. It was flavorful, full of noodles, dumplings, chicken and veggies, the underlying soup base was to die for!  There was a bit of a wait for the entree, but not that long, maybe 15 minutes or so.  The wait was well worth it.  My food arrived hot, fresh and oh so delicious.  I received 2 fried pork chops with a generous helping of homemade stuffing in between and covered in delicious gravy.  The pork chops were tender, and seasoned perfectly.  The stuffing was tasty as well, it was a little more sweet than I'm used to, but still delicious.  I'm assuming that the stuffing is made from the same cornbread served on the side of each entree, which was also sweet (and tasty).  The mixed greens were mouthwatering good.  Tender, seasoned and a bit vinegary....just perfect.  I thought that my grandmother, might be in the kitchen!   Last but not least the mac n cheese definitely lived up to the Yelp review, cooked perfectly, with just the right amount of cheesy goodness. Also the sweet tea was a perfect accompaniment to my meal. My server Kesha was prompt, courteous and could not have been any nicer.  The only downside was that there was only 1 option for dessert, banana pudding, which I'm sure would have been tasty, but I'm not a big fan of banana pudding.  I was hoping for some homemade sweet potato pie, pound cake, or peach cobbler.  All in all this was a GREAT meal.  I will definitely return (can't wait!)",

We tried their signature fried chicken and smoked ribs, along with sides of sweet potato fries, greens, fish stew, and candied yams. The chicken is definitely worth trying; I haven't had such juicy chicken in Pittsburgh, and probably in all western PA as they claim. In terms of sides, I thoroughly enjoyed the greens, candied yams, and fish stew. The ribs were so-so (probably better at Showcase), so next time I'll try something else like the tilapia.",

There aren't many places to eat good soul food in our area so this place was a refreshing change, for sure.  To start, I ordered the chicken & dumplings soup which was INSANELY good and a perfect starter before my smothered chicken entree.  The chicken was perfectly fried, covered in super flavorful gravy, and the cornbread made the entire meal!  For sides, I ordered the green beans and macaroni and cheese, which were good but overshadowed a bit by the rest of my meal's tastiness.  Overall, service was good and the server was great about letting us know how long our food would take to prepare, which was well worth the wait!",

    "text": "I'm not sure how long this place has been open, but I did not know about it until I saw a Groupon.  So I took my usual breakfast club for a visit after an overnight of working.  I wasn't sure what to expect when we walked in, and I'm guessing they do mostly dinner business.  (One of my friends commented that it looked like they got their artwork at Family Dollar.)  But the fact that they are open at 7am and offer chicken and waffles is enough for me to give it a try.  Our waitress was very nice, an older woman who we had fun with - and she had that jovial grandma laugh, too, which makes the place feel more cozy.  My friends all ordered the King's Breakfast that pretty much included everything on the breakfast menu (waffle or pancakes, two meats, eggs, potatoes and grits).  I kept it simple with the Chicken and Waffles and a side of bacon.  Oh, and a sweet tea.  The sweet tea was refreshing, with just a hint of lemon.  The bacon was thick and crispy, the way it should be (the menu said 2 strips of bacon were a side, but I got three!).  The waffle was good, nothing over the top, but the chicken, oh the chicken....it was glorious.  I got to select the piece I wanted and I opted for the breast.  It was moist on the inside, crispy on the outside.  And whatever the seasoning is, they got it right.  I couldn't rave about it enough to our waitress.  I asked for hot sauce, and then really didn't feel I needed it.  My friends seemed equally pleased with their meals as well.  I will definitely recommend this place.  The prices weren't too outrageous.  My Chicken and Waffles was $6.99, the side of bacon was $1.99.  The King's Breakfast was $9.99.  The main reason I deducted one star is the wait.  It seemed like our food took a very long time when we were the only ones there.  It could be because we ordered so much food or that we got there shortly after they opened at 7am and the kitchen wasn't quite prepared.  Whatever the reason, I won't hold it against Carmi and I will certainly be back for more of that amazing chicken.",

I went on a Sunday, and luckily for me it wasn't as pack as I thought it was going to be. Then again I went when it first open that morning, and it wasn't during football season. So I can only imagine how this place is during football season. With that being said I got the chicken with collard greens, macaroni and cheese, and yams with cornbread. My wife got the ribs with rice and yams. We enjoyed everything about this place. The food took a while coming out, but other than that I enjoyed my time at this restaurant. I even ordered sole food to go, so I could have some later that night lol.   If you're in town and looking for some soul food; this is definitely the place to go.",

If you're craving good quality soul food, try here. Very generous portions and everything was very tasty. I tried some of my friend's candied yams and they might've been the best I ever had. They were so sweet and full of flavor.   I ordered the shrimp and grits. This was good at first however, I definitely recommend getting an extra serving of shrimp. There was way too much grits left over once I was done eating all the shrimp.   The service was lackluster at best. No one ever came back to refill our water. Once someone finally did refill our waters, the server spilled the whole pitcher on my friend's lap! She only apologized once and no one offered to \"make the wrong.. right\". Sometimes the included sides don't come with your meal either. The first time my friend and I went here, they forgot our cornbread which on the menu said, was included with our dinner entree. We didn't really mind since we were appeased with the generous portions of food we already received. This second time I visited, they also forgot my friend's cornbread.   I used a Groupon here and that caused a little bit of confusion. My friends called ahead to make sure we could use two groupons for a group of four people. The woman that answered the phone said that shouldn't be a problem. There was a lack of communication because once we tried paying for the groupons- the server told us that we could only use one per table. That was a minor annoyance. The real annoyance that comes with this issue is the fact that my served redeemed one Groupon but then the manager had to come up and tell me that my Groupon could not be redeemed because I did not order two entrees. The served told me that they would reverse the redemption so I could use my Groupon another time- they never did so, I lost the equivalent of $12 (amount paid for the Groupon).   I would come here again because the food is decent. However, the customer service is lacking here. I did not feel truly welcome at this establishment.",

My friend had the blackened pork chops with fried corn and cheese grits. That pork chop (he shared with me) was tender and delicious!!! Not a fan of fried corn. The grits were just ok.  The cornbread. Moist. Cake like. Sweet. Went excellent with my greens.  If i return back for work, i will definitely come back. This is a gem on the Southside of Pittsburgh.  Bravo!",

The menu offers a great selection of dishes; it was really hard to choose! I ordered the fried chicken and it did not disappoint. Each dinner comes with the option of soup or salad and two sides. I got the hot sausage soup; which was just alright. To be honest it tasted like elevated chef boyardee but that's not necessarily a bad thing! I picked sweet potato fries and cornbread stuffing as my two sides. The fries were wonderful and complimented the savoriness of the chicken very well. The stuffing on the other hand was a little dry for my taste. If I go again I'd definitely try the Mac and cheese.  The service was a tad slow but very friendly and helpful.  Overall, I would recommend Carmi and I'd definitely go again.",

I mean everyone we interacted with was pleasant even though we were just getting in under the wire.  We even slipped in a chicken and dumpling to go..

My favorite thing about Carmi (besides the great atmosphere) is the Mac & Cheese. If cheese was good for the waistline I would eat this with every dish.   The entree's come with a ton of options including 2 sides (I typically double up on the Mac & Cheese). You will always leave this place full and satisfied. The only knock I'd give is some spotty service. Other than that this place is splendid for high quality soulful cuisine.",

Wait staff is young and whatever they lack in experience they make up for in effort.   I visited on a Sunday during a work trip (when my flight was cancelled *cue uncontrollable eye rol. I was traveling solo so I sat by the bar where I sparked up a conversation with who I found out later was one of the owners. I could sort of tell because I noticed she was the same one on the t-shirts lol. I ordered the carmi punch and the catfish and grits and a side of mixed greens with smoked turkey. Food was exactly what I wanted/needed. Definitely had a lot of soul and southern flair. Cornmeal crust on the catfish was super crispy, the mixed greens had all that smoked turkey flavor and the cheese grits were damn near perfect. I could have done with the yellow cheese on top of the grits tho (but then maybe they wouldnt be cheesy grits).   I could tell based on the conversations that its a place loved by the community. There were a lot of  \"hey Aunties\" and \"long time no sees\", seemed like there are a lot of regulars.   If Im ever in Pittsburgh again Im coming back for seconds.",

The greatest concern for me was knowing that the owner of the establishment was supervising the unprofessionalism and when addressed about the issue was EXTREMELY unprofessional and unpleasant herself!! I felt at that time like I didn't matter. My business was not wanted and I just wanted to be served with my bigger party.    Diving into the details: As a large group of 15. We do understand somethings taking extra time. But the way you handle things as an owner is the most important! I'd recommend better organization and time management as a small BLack business! A standard should be not only upheld but defined!! Based on the non greeting when entering, the unprofessionalism and aggression of management this business has no standard!   The food was subpar. I ordered the catfish brunch with sweet potatoes, grits, and cornbread. However when I got my meal my sides were sweet potatoes and greens. The greens was supposed to be grits. But because it was so long waiting for the food it was an issue and instead of being apologetic, the owner was defensive.   What I was really dissatisfied with was the customer service, the lack of respect for the patrons, and business sense/culture that's echoed throughout this establishment.",

I think it was around 430pm so the restaurant was pretty empty.  We were seated immediately and they came to take our orders fast. We ordered chicken and waffles with collard greens. My boyfriend ordered catfish and grits . The food came out hot and ready to eat. I have to say if you have not come here, you need to. My waffle was big and fluffy . The chicken was juicy and crispy on the outside. It was like my grandma made it. The catfish was crispy and very big. The grits were very good but somewhat oily so be aware of that.  The meal was not overly expensive. It was comparable to what you'll see on the southside. This place is a hidden gem",

From hospitable service to healthy portions, Carmis is everything you could ask for from a soul food joint.  The buzz has been around Carmis for quite some time and it's easy to see why. The menu is extensive with traditional soul food dishes like fried chicken, turkey ribs, fried catfish and cornbread. Even the Soulmosa, a tropical spin on the traditional orange juice and champagne drink, has that southern taste to it. I recommend the Mac n cheese, greens and sweet potatoes as side dishes.   Carmis did not disappoint one bit. We are excited to make plans for next week's brunch at Carmis again!",

A+++  But on a serious note... Every now and then you have a meal that is so good you just can't live without it. Carmi's is that meal for me. There was a point and time I was coming here AT LEAST once a week.   They have the best fried chicken you will ever have. It is perfectly crispy, greasy and flavorful. The chicken stays hot the entire meal, it's simply amazing!   The sides are all incredible as well. The candied yams are a tasty explosion for your taste buds, the cornbread is perfectly moist and fluffy but for me my go to is the baked mac and cheese with hot sauce. Just wow....   I have lived in Pittsburgh for many years and I've eaten chicken and waffles with baked mac and cheese from Carmi at least 100 times easily I kid you not. All the food is cooked fresh and made to order so there is a bit of a wait but it is well worth it! Carmi for the win!!!",

Just two of us for dinner and there were only three other tables seated when we got there, yet from the point of taking our order to actually getting our meal was an hour and fifteen minutes. No exaggeration. The soup came out within a few minutes and then... nothing.     When the food finally came out, one of the sides was no longer available. Waitress asked what we wanted to replace it with, but couldn't tell us what the options were and ultimately we just said forget it.  The table beside us and the table behind us both seemed to have almost identical experiences in terms of ridiculous wait times. The table behind us still hadn't received their food when we were leaving and were complaining to the waitress.  Aside from that, the food we did get was tasty, but I ordered the ribs and have to admit I was really expecting more than just two. They were fall off the bone tender though.  The cornbread, as others have said, was a huge portion and amazing.  The dumpling soup was great. The sweet potato pie was piping hot and crazy delicious... highly recommended.  I'd be willing to try it again, because the food really was good, but maybe just not on a night when I'm drop dead starving.",

Just as another Yelper said, the pieces are tiny.  The sides (mac n cheese and candied yams) were EXCELLENT!  The side salad was fine.   I wouldn't rush to go back unless I had a craving for soul food and didn't feel like making it myself.  They should really consider adding more chicken to their offerings to make it worth the $12 they charge for each meal.  Another recommendation would be for to-go waffle orders, the butter should be put in a separate container so as to not make it soggy when you finally eat it.   I wish Pittsburgh had more soul food options because the one's I've visited are kinda sub-par for the prices they ask.",

I really enjoyed the waffles, they were buttery with powdered sugar on top. The chewy/crisy ratio was perfect. The fried chicken breast was moist and the seasoning was present but not overpowering.   Despite the good food, Carmi's is best enjoyed to go. The atmosphere is just sad, dingy and depressing. I have a hunch that this establishment moved into an old Irish bar and never renovated the space because you can still smell the cigarette smoke from 20 years ago and there is virtually no sunlight. And I get dingy, I've been to my fair share of dives, but kick up the music or something. The sad and gloomy 70s-90s ballads took me to the point where I couldn't overlook the divey/old-school aesthetic. Donny Hathaway's \"Song For You\" in that dreary atmosphere was just too much and made me want my check pronto. Come on, spare me please!",

There is a sign that lets you know that the food is made fresh, and that it may take a while. It was absolutely worth the wait. We got chicken and dumplings, fried chicken, meatloaf, two servings of Mac n cheese, two pieces of cornbread, one serving of mashed potatoes, and one serving of fried corn. What impressed me the most was how well everything was seasoned. Nothing was even remotely bland. They aren't afraid of salt and pepper. I'm not big into cornbread, but I would eat this cornbread any time. Fried chicken was juicy and had a nice crunchy breading, potatoes were awesome, gravy was super smooth, meatloaf was so unique and melted in your mouth, corn was nice and crisp, and the Mac n cheese was just what you would expect... perfect!

    "text": "Fantastic. From start to finish, this was a great meal. The chicken and dumpling soup was out of this world. The flavor was great and it wasn't over or under seasoned, it was just right. Then came the fried chicken. I had the leg and thigh meal which came with two sides and cornbread. I had the Mac n cheese which was every bit as good as others have described and the potato salad.  Back to the chicken itself, great spices and very flavorful. Despite all of the food we had, I didn't feel horrible and sluggish afterwards which can happen sometimes with soul food. I don't know what they did differently, but I liked it!  Overall, great gem on the northside with friendly service and excellent food.",

They were lightly  breaded which I liked. Not heavily seasoned pretty much just tastes like salt and black pepper. They were pretty good I could've eaten more though. The greens were yummy they use turkey meat and I believe vinegar I enjoyed it. The sweet potato fries had sugar on them which I thought was pretty gross but they were good if you cleaned off the sugar.   The sweet tea is not brewed so you could pass on that.  The cornbread is delicious it is made with more finely ground cornmeal tastes like cake.   The Mac and cheese is pretty good. I enjoyed that and repeatedly ate everyone else's.",

Chicken, pork chops, meatloaf, mac and cheese, sweet potatoes, greens, smashed potatoes, fried corn, cabbage, cornbread all completely authentic down home cooking. Try the chicken or pork chops cooked in any preparation fried, smothered, blackened or bbq and you will not be sorry. My favorite is the smothered chicken or chops, that gravy is so good. The atmosphere is clean and a little outdated but endearing with old school r&b and gospel playing. Great, friendly and fast service. You must try the fish stew. It is beautiful and spicy. Really good grits too. It is BYOB 3.00 corking. It's also a great place to bring kids and my 14 year olds favorite place. Go for breakfast and it a great place for Sunday brunch. If you keep an eye out you can find it on groupon and amazon local. If you have family coming in from the south this is a great representation of Pittsburgh soul food.",

    "text": "I came here after visiting the Mattress Factory.  Given that I'm a huge fan of Southern/soul food, this place was high on my to-try list.  It certainly did not disappoint--nay, it exceeded my expectations!  I ordered the fried chicken, and it was truly wonderful--the best I've tasted in PGH to date!  The combination of crispiness on the outside and moistness on the inside, and the delicious flavor, was incredible.  For sides, I ordered the mashed potatoes and, of course, the macaroni and cheese.  This place has the best mac and cheese I've tasted in the city so far (rating: 9.5/10); it's just bursting with cheesiness, and it has a wonderfully creamy texture.  I took half home and it was just as good the next day.  The cornbread that came with the meal was moist and dense--just the way I like it.  In addition to all this, the meal came with a chicken and dumpling soup that was just as delicious as the rest of it.  Our servers were also nice and attentive, though the atmosphere could use some improvement (lighten up the place!)  I look forward to returning to try the chicken and waffles, since this is one of my favorite dishes.  Given the quality of the food, I'll be back soon--once I'm off my diet!",

Starting with the tangy, succulent fall off the bone ribs, with mac and cheese, the best corn bread above the Mason Dixon line!! The pork chops were nicely seasoned and tender. Then we come to the fried chicken and waffles!!! Bite into the crispy, crunchy coating, and you now have a party in your mouth! The fried chicken is exceptional, just delicious. Accompanied by a tasty waffle drenched with maple syrup, you've now reached your Utopia!! Great comfort food!! End your meal with some really good Banana pudding, go home happy and full!!!",

Mac and cheese was very good as was the corn bread. Not to wild about the greens but they weren't over cooked. Just didn't like the flavor. But give it a try if you like greens. 4+ stars  Overall - very good. I would give it 4.5 stars but I can't do that on yelp. Good comfort food and I'm still full 8 hours later.",

    "text": "The inside of this restaurant looks like a grandma's dining room, complete with linoleum tables.   The bathroom is very old school and not wheel-chair accessible. There are a ton of fruit flies that must dig the air fresheners.  I'll break this review down into two areas: the service and the food.  The Service: It took 15 minutes to receive my first glass of water, and 45 minutes after that for a refill. They tell you up front that the food will take a long time to come out, but that doesn't excuse the poor service. The wait staff avoided eye contact and spent the majority of the 3 hours hovering by the kitchen.  After our food arrived, the waitress didn't ask if we had all we needed, so we had to flag her down for basic condiments.  Once we received the check, it took 25 minutes for the waitress to pick up the payment. My 92 year old grandfather ran out of patience.  The Food: The fried chicken was excellent. Crispy and flavorful, without excess grease.  The macaroni and cheese, yams, corn bread, and French fries were great! The pork chop tasted like fried flour. If you order shrimp and grits, make sure you bring your own shrimp. The bowl was large, with tasty presentation, but just 6 shrimp in a sea of grits won't fill you up.  The waffle was heavy and bland. The combination is nothing like Roscoe's.   Decent food, ruined by the saltiness of the service.",

We were finally seated and it took forever for a waitress to come and take a drink order, it was as if there was some confusion as to who would waitress our table.  Our waitress came over and finally brought us drinks and she was pleasant and took our food order. FAST FORWARD AN HOUR LATER and we have not received our food and our initial drinks have not been refilled. The waitress finally realizes that our food hasn't arrived and she goes and checks on it but it was still another 15 minutes before we actually received our plates.  The food was not piping hot like food that you've waited an hour and 15 minutes for should be. It was tasty though, I will give them that. I am not pressed to go back because the food was tasty but not tasty enough to counteract the poor service.",

While it was a bit of a wait it was well worth it, the chicken was well seasoned and the waffle made just right my daughter enjoyed it.  I don't even know where to begin on the shrimp & grits the grits had an explosion of flavor their is a lot of cheese and shrimp along with different spices, you get a large helping of shrimp and grits and a piece of cornbread on the side, there was so much I couldn't even finish it I had to take half of it home.  The chicken and waffles was around $8.95 and the shrimp & grits was around $9.85.  The shrimp & grits did have quite a bit of extra butter in it, but once you stir it up it's not bad.  Our waitress was friendly and made sure we had everything we needed and we will definitely be back to try some of the other things on the menu.",

We had a party of six and needed to accommodate an electric wheelchair so our wait was going to be long and that is totally fine.Though there wasn't a lot of space for us upfront I asked to use the restroom and on my way I asked if it would be OK if I sat at the bar while we wait for our table the wait staff said yes. We sat at the bar and the wait staff came and went ringing in their orders and making their customers that were seated at the table streaks no one acknowledged our presence at the bar and almost seemed as if they thought as being there was a bit funny. Finally I asked a woman that was ringing in an order \" is it a usual occurrence for people to sit at the bar no one acknowledged them\" the guy beside me started to laugh. By this time I'm livid and I didn't find anything funny- I asked him what's so funny and he said oh I'm sorry I'm the usual bartender but I'm done and my replacement is in here so the bar is closed. NO ONE who was in the clock told us that! A waiter came back behind the bar to make his table a drink and I asked while your back there could you pour me a drink he turned around and said \"absolutely not! \"I thought it was a joke until he turned around and walked away. I had to take a walk and ended up going next-door to a restaurant and having a drink to calm myself down I came back gather the rest of my party and we walked across the street to have dinner only after I let the manager know how horrible I felt that we were treated and her answer was .... Oh OK. Please do not waste your time in an establishment who doesn't know that they should treat their customers like guests!",

    "text": "So... since I was 11 years old and first saw the movie \"Little Nicky\" featuring Adam Sandler I have dreamt of the day I would eat chicken and waffles. In the last 13 years I have come across many an establishment that offered this enticing option, but none of them ever felt like the \"right\" place. The other night I walk into a True institution of culinary excellence known as \"Carmi Soul Food.\" After taking a seat my friend turns to me and says \"chicken and waffles is on the menu.\" I look intently around the restaurant and no one was eating the chicken and waffles, but I think to myself \"this is the place... and tonight... is the night.\" I am offered the option of 3 wings, a breast, or a leg and a thigh. I am recommended the 3 wings and with pure joy in my heart, place my first ever order... of chicken and waffles. Time passes and 3 beautiful reddish brown chicken wings are delicately places next to golden waffles pre-buttered and dusted with powdered sugar. I carefully cut the first quarter of the waffles and touch my fork to the chicken which falls like rain from the bone. I take the first bite and nothing, not even the table continues to exist as eat. I am interrupted part way through intently but politely telling my friends \"do not speak to me.\"   I stand here a forever a changed man and am humbled to be able to recommend this establishment",

I have to say, despite the dark interior, and outside appearance, I was quite happy with our experience.    I teetered on what to get but finally chose the Fried chicken (I got the breast) which came with 2 sides and a soup or salad. I got the greens and cornbread dressing.  My soup was the chicken and biscuit.  Everything was good.  My favorite part was the greens though.    Service was polite and with a smile.  We will definitely be back sometime soon for some homemade Soul food!",

There were four seats open that we could see right in front of us but we were told we had to wait for the band to pack up. An hour went by and we didn't leave because at this point we are invested on eating. They move us right to the seat we were looking at empty for an hour. Haven't been back since. Disappointed because i love supporting my minority families but i don't know when I'll be back.",

I had not one complaint! My next adventure will be to actually travel to this restaurant and try something different on the menu. But now you know, they cater ;)",

I asked to see the upstairs just in case we want to have a private party and she wouldn't even let me up there just to take a look \"are you freaking kidding me\". They must be hiding something up there. I wanted to express my honest opinion of Carmi's restaurant and none of my family and friends will ever go there again. BTW my Aunt still paid full price for her food but I would've told them to keep that food and would not have paid a dime.",

There was an abundance of staff members interacting with with each other, not at all eager to help the customers. After waiting to be seated, we continued to wait over 10 minutes while said staff goofed around but failed to acknowledge us, therefore we left.

Upon entering we were greeting by Gospel Music playing and were all pleasantly surprised by the updated decor. The walls are now two different shades of brown and a dark red. The ceiling is chocolate brown and there are new table coverings, lighting and even new menus with the husband and wife team on the cover. Keionna was our waitress and she took good care of us.  We started out with Sweet Tea for our drinks. My wife and I both went with the Fried Chicken dinner which comes with soup or salad, two sides and cornbread. For sides I had fried corn and mac & cheese and she had mac & cheese and greens. Our daughter got the chicken and waffles.  I went with the chicken and dumpling soap and the wife got a salad. The soap was simply delicious. The last time I got it, it was way too peppery. This time it was perfect.  Now let me tell you about that chicken. I don't know what they changed but it was better than ever! The skin was nice and crispy and the chicken was hot and tender. The mac & cheese was also better then I remembered. My only complaint was that the fried corn could have been fried for a few more minutes. It wasn't cooked quite long enough for my liking. My wife loved her chicken, greens and mac & cheese as well.   And of course our daughter was pleased with her meal as she tried to save half of her food for later but, just couldn't resist finishing it off. My wife and I could only finish half of our food and took the rest home.  All and all our food was very, very good and better than ever. I won't wait so long  before we return. I must say after this visit I can honestly say that Carmi Family Restaurant is THE BEST SOUL FOOD RESTAURANT IN PITTSBURGH!!!",

    "text": "My soul was VERY happy after my visit to Carmi.  Okay, so the inside is nothing to write home about...a little dark and cafeteria-esque, but when you're slinging food as delicious as they are, ambiance really doesn't matter to me. Heck, I'd gladly eat some of their fried chicken and mac and cheese inside of a dumpster.   Speaking of the food...almost everything we ate was a slam dunk. I ordered the BBQ chicken breasts, which came with two sides (I got mac and cheese and sweet potato fries), cornbread, and soup (I opted for chicken and dumpling).  Since I also wanted to try the fried chicken, I forced hubby to get that (thanks hubby!), and he chose sides of candied yams, potato salad, and fish stew for the soup.  The chicken and dumpling soup came out first, and I could've ended my meal there and been completely satisfied. The soup was thick, hearty, creamy, and stew-like...almost a meal in and of itself! It tasted like the filling of a well-made chicken pot pie.  My BBQ chicken meal consisted of two small chicken breast medallions smothered in tons of sauce. I must admit that the chicken wasn't my favorite. It was fairly overcooked -- quite dry and a bit tough. Their BBQ sauce, however, was stellar -- sweet with a slight hint of smoke and spice.   However, the True hero on my plate was the mac and cheese. This is the mac and cheese to end all mac and cheeses. The noodles were cooked a perfect al dente. The sauce was rich and packed to the gills with ooey-gooey cheesiness. This is the kind of creamy, decadent mac and cheese that you can just  FEEL travelling directly from your esophagus into your arteries, but you don't care because you've been put into a temporary mac and cheese-induced euphoric state...mmm...  Where was I? Oh yes, the food. So, needless to say, I highly recommend the mac and cheese. The sweet potato fries were interesting, although not necessarily my cup of tea. They were lightly tossed in butter and then sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. I prefer my sweet potato fries on the savory as opposed to the sweet side, but Carmi's take on them was definitely interesting. I really enjoyed the cornbread. It was dense, moist, flavorful, and sweet (but not too sweet).  As for my husband's food, it earned rave reviews as well. I stole several bites of his fried chicken and it was to die for!  It was *perfectly* cooked, with a light, crisp, peppery coating encasing deliciously juicy meat. His sides were also tasty -- the candied yams were the perfect texture (not too firm, not too mushy) with a warmly-spiced sauce, and the potato salad was well-balanced and flavorful.  Obviously since each meal comes with meat + 2 sides + cornbread + soup, this is a TON of food. I had to tap out before I could finish. So it's a great value. At the time we were there, the prices on their menu were slightly higher than what's currently posted on their website. Also, they charge a small $.25 fee to use credit cards ($.50 for Discover or Amex).  Service was friendly and efficient. All food is cooked to order, so they have signs at the table that prime you to expect that your food may take longer to come out than you might be used to. However, I don't think the wait for our food was unreasonable at all (maybe 20 minutes?)  Overall, the chicken and dumpling soup, the mac and cheese and the fried chicken will have me coming back to Carmi as soon as I can. And next time I'm definitely going to wear expandable pants.",

So I knew not to expect anything short of an hour when we went last night.   My grandma had the Chicken and Dumpling Soup she said it was amazing! It looked really good she ate it so fast I couldn't steal a spoonful. My salad was fresh and crisp. I prefer a lot of dressing so the mini cup of ranch it came with was a teaser. For my entree I had the Turkey Ribs (3 big bones) usually turkey ribs are really small I was surprised they were a nice size and full of meat. All of the side I had were good and big in portion! Nothing is worse than getting small portion sides. That is not a problem here. If you like Greens then I highly suggest them. Top 3 Greens I've ever had. Mac and cheese was really good and not everyone can do good Mac so kudos to that. The yams were perfect I stole half of my daughters order lol my Uncle loved the Chicken and Waffles. The waitress made sure to make us aware that the chicken was going to take 22 mins to cook.   We ordered our food when we order our drinks. Took about 20 mins for 5 drinks and about another 10 for the soup/salad app. Our food was delivered after about an hour. You almost forget what you are there for it takes so long. I had to ask for a refill 2 times and watch the waitress stand around for a few minutes before she decided to bring it. We sat by the door so I heard people complaining behind me because they couldn't get anyone to take their to go order. They have about 15-20 tables not all were full and like 4 servers being an ex server I expected the service to be stellar like the food.",

I never been a fan of cornbread but after eating this good size portion, I must admit that this has to be the best in the city. Can't say enough good about this restaurant. Friendly staff, great atmosphere and a beautiful setting. The best thing is it is just up-street from where I live.",

I came for Brunch--had the Queen's Breakfast (check the website for the menu <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FCarmi.com&s=e936f078f3d9134da6655c1939c4d0b08760621cdc053051e7cc875c5eb7d6d0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carmi.com</a>) and added two fried chicken wings. I didn't finish half of my waffle (that was fantastic!) or eat any of my wings, so I have something for tonight!  I will be back...maybe tomorrow! Can you say delightful nostalgia?! Felt like I was back home with my Grannie!   Oh! And the service was great and felt more like family interactions than being served.   Diverse patrons.   Love it! Perfect!",

Stuffed pork chop with corn bread stuffing and gravy was a great comfort food. If they have the chicken and dumplings soup. I highly recommend it. The staff was friendly The atmosphere was relaxing.",

Portion size was awesome as well, come hungry and you won't be disappointed! Future trips to Pittsburgh will revolve around Carmi's hours, can't wait to try the fried chicken and waffles.",
