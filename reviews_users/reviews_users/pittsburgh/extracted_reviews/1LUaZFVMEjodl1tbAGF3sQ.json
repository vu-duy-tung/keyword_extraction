    "text": "Andy the Sushi Guy.   Fast, entertaining, friendly and did I say fast?  No worries about standing in line and taking a few minutes of your busy day to watch Andy work his magic.  After all, it's not often one can find a fresh fish market with the freshest sushi ingredients. And you can bet Andy the Sushi Guy won't skimp on ingredients.   We stopped by on Saturday about lunchtime when Wholey's is packed with its Saturday shoppers, which is it's usual crowded busy-ness.  Andy's Special for the day:  Tuna & Kiwi  or  Salmon & Avocado FAT Rolls.  Yes, the special of the day is usually a FUTO maki extraordinaire.   We ordered the Tuna & Kiwi and Andy's Sushi Combo.   Tuna & Kiwi began with crispy dried nori (seaweed) topped with an ample amount of fluffy sushi rice.  Smeared on is Tobiko (flying fish eggs) with its bright orange color. Just as you're admiring his steadfastness, POP goes the rice ladened seaweed as  Andy flips the seaweed to create a reverse sushi roll.  Folks, I'd have to disagree with another Yelper when they say that nori goes on the outside. What's not to like about creativity? And personally, what's not to like about more ingredients that you can stick on the outside of a sushi roll?  Like Tobiko or sesame seeds? hhmm...????  Continuing with the innerds of the Tuna & Kiwi roll, more Tobiko, asparagus, seared tuna with a light breading, red leafed lettuce, fresh tuna and kiwi...a la Andy's Special of the day.  Roll up all of these and keeping it in tact so when the slicing begins, all of the innerds remain in tact. Whoosh!  Did you see how he picked up the whole futomaki (fat roll) and placed it in the clear togo container, fan it out, add an ample handful of shyoga (thinly sliced pickled ginger) and a hunk of wasabi (no explanation needed) with soy sauce in a mini condiment cup. Sushi a la Andy the Sushi Guy at Wholey's~~It's what's for dinner! If Andy didn't cut the roll, it would take two hands to pick it up and eat it like a ginormous fat burrito, kinda like you'd get in one of them hole in the wall Tex-Mex joints down close to the border (the US Border, that is).  But it is cut into yummy 8 slices and is done quickly without smushing down the circular form. Instead, admire the sliced sushi serving as you lay it flat and be amazed at the color and textures of the ingredients. Not only does it have fresh fish, but some veggies to add to your daily vitamin intake.   The only 'drawback' and I think that is what some of the sushi connoisseurs are quick to point out, is that the sushi rice is not seasoned.  Yes, folks, traditional sushi rice is seasoned with a slight glaze and a very subtle sweetness.  Now, if Andy seasoned the sushi rice as sushi rice should be seasoned, then I'd have to give the guy at least a 4.5 star rating (fresh ingredients, ample servings, creativity, appearance or presentation and seasoned sushi rice on top of all of that).  I think I'm going to have to defend Sushi a la Andy against the folks looking for 'traditional sushi' in a sit down sushi bar.  You ain't gonna find it here.  And if that's the limit on your sushi palate, then you're certainly coming to the wrong place!  For if you're looking for fast, fresh and ample, this is it.  The bonus:  Andy treats you with friendly hospitality and part of the Wholey's family.",

    "text": "My fiance and I always have a fun time when we stop by Andy's to get ourselves some sushi. I usually head down to the Strip when the weather's bad to try to avoid crowds, so we've never had to deal with too much of a line. Last time we visited we even got to sample a spring roll Andy whipped up while waiting for customers.  The rolls are definitely larger than anything else you'll find when looking for take out sushi. I've had one from him where a given piece of a roll was 2-3 bites.   I also usually stick to his specials, which for me always combine flavors atypical to your average sushi place. I'd never had basil in sushi before, but it really made the flavor of the roll.  Andy's is a great place to stop if you're out and about and want some cheap sushi to-go. Everything I've had there has been great, but he definitely has a few oddballs thrown in the mix, so if you're a stickler for traditional sushi, this might not be the place for you.",

No pre-made sushi at Andy's, he make everything fresh, right in front of your eyes.    Andy himself is a funny guy, chatting up customers while whipping out some of the best sushi I've had in my life.  (I travel a lot and have sushi eaten in many cities and countries around the globe.)  My first time in he brazenly told me that one I ate his sushi, I wouldn't be able to eat anywhere else.  He was almost right - I haven't gone anywhere else in Pittsburgh since but must admit to trying to fulfill my sushi fix in other cities.    Lastly, Andy's is a friendly place.  He often gives samples to customers waiting to order.  And his customers are good, loyal, Midwesterners, willing to strike up a conversation with anybody standing next to them in line.  A good thing if you have to wait 10-20 minutes at lunch to get your order.  The friendly vibe almost makes you forget you've been waiting.  Andy is doing the 'Burgh proud.  He has big selection of nagiri, maki and sashimi - all at great prices.  You can take his food upstairs in Wholey's to eat or take it back to your office/house/shade tree to enjoy.  Too bad he closes shop at 5PM.",

Next the place is in Wholey Fish Market, Wholey gets fresh fish daily, so you know his sushi is going to be some of the freshest in Pittsburgh. Finally, the price, load up on Andy's rolls and sashimi for the fairest price in the city.  Try Andy's roll and the Eel sashimi.  Go see Andy for some great sushi and sashimi.",

Not to mention I was given a third 1 at no additional cost)  The presentation itself leaves something to be desired, not the most skilled with a knife, but the guy has to pump them out fast enough to keep the line moving. - and lets be honest, you're not going to a stand in wholeys for presentation. His special sauce is tasty, some sort of sirracha-esq conccoction, but make sure you make note of it if you don't want this on your fish. Uses a bit too much rice for my liking on the nigiri pieces, I think he could use about half as much. Though I understand he is located next to a primantis, and this is pittsburgh.  Fantastic value, great guy. Will return.  oh, and I really mean he's a great guy beyond the generosity with the fish. Today he temporarily stopped service to help a little girl find her mother.",

I know this is a difficult one to rate, since he runs a stand within another establishment (Wholeys) but I am giving 5 glowing stars nontheless for the amazing sushi he makes (right in front of you) and his stellar personality. I have never met a person with blood flowing in their veins that didn't get a total kick out of Andy.  When I worked in the Strip, I ate here almost daily. After only two visits, he remembered exactly what I ordered and would start making it as soon as he saw me: spicy yellowtail with avocado. Or just yellowtail with avocado. Maybe some cucumber. Have I mentioned that I am obsessed with yellowtail? Ahhhh, the buttery-ness, the texture, the slight taste of the sea....oh wait, this isn't a review on a singular fish, i got a little carried away (even though Andy serves up some damn fine YT)!   Sometimes he gets creative and mashes different flavor concepts together for you to sample as you wait. He once came up with a maki roll made of salmon, basil, cucumber and mango....brilliant!!  Wholeys is such a fantastic people watching spot anyway and it's always amusing to see random people of all ages/genders/sizes walk in and yell \"ANDY\"!",

Andy's Sushi Bar ain't in the same galaxy.  However, I must say, Andy is the man. How can you go wrong with a take-out only sushi restaurant inside the largest fresh fish market in town (Wholey's)? Especially in a town like Pittsburgh which doesn't come to mind when you think fresh sushi.  I've had my fair share of nasty fish around town. Even in some nice places that looked like the fish should have tasted better (and fresher) than it was. Then I found Andy. No frills, no bar, but hey, the fish is as fresh as you're gonna get in these parts of the USA.  People seem to line-up for his endless list of rolls - and there are plenty. I never got why someone would order a Fried Chicken Roll. Personally, I prefer the lunch special which includes 8 pieces of nigiri sushi (whatever is fresh that day....usually yellowtail, tuna, salmon and eel), as well as eight pieces of some roll Andy throws together in front of you - like a spicy California Roll or Salmon and Cucumber Roll. You get what he thinks is the freshest catch of the day. Total is around $14.00 for this particular order.  And one other word of caution, especially around holidays and on Fridays, Wholey's can be jammed with people - I mean packed - so if you don't like crowds, or if you don't like standing in line to order your food and watch Andy make it fresh - then CALL AHEAD and place your order for pick-up.   There is also a decent sized dining room upstairs (paper covered tables) that you can eat in if you don't want to take the food to go.",

    "text": "I've been in Pittsburgh for a long time, and if you read through my reviews, you'll see that I love eating in Pittsburgh. I'm from NYC, so it's not that my palate is easy to satisfy. I just really think that Pittsburgh has great restaurants with authentic, and tasty foods. I am a serious advocate of dining in Pittsburgh, and I take pride in knowing the good places to eat. There, those are my self-proclaimed credentials.   So take this to heart: Andy's Sushi Bar (located in Wholey's) is probably the #1 place to get sushi/rolls in Pittsburgh. Now, a few caveats: it is NOT a restaurant, it is a stand inside Wholey's supermarket that does take-out orders ONLY. You will NOT get a dining experience, so for those of you who want to go to a nice japanese restaurant for dinner, you are not in luck. This sushi stand is only open for lunch, and typically closes at about 4pm on a weekday. You could be waiting about 15-30 minutes depending on the time/day you go because there is just one guy who makes the orders. He's fast, but his line can get long.   Take it for what it is: Andy uses fresh and tasty fish. He cuts you big pieces for both his a la carte pieces and his rolls. He will make you any custom order you'd like provided he has the ingredients. He does have a limited selection of Sushi/Sashimi platters. He has a good spider roll and after going a few times, definitely ask for the \"Chef's Special\" -- he just loads up a roll for you. You won't be disappointed.  And, as for prices, it's the best bang for your buck for sushi. what more could you ask for.",

    "text": "Fantastic! I've been here on many separate occasions and must say, going around closing time is typically the best time. Because Andy's sushi is merely a stand inside Wholey's fish market, lines can be intimidating and sort of messy. Additionally, Andy does not communicate as much as a result of the crowd, hence making the end of the day the best time to go.   Watching Andy make the rolls very quickly is a rather fun experience to be completely honest, I definitely recommend it!  Overall, the rolls are very delicious and unique. Each time you order a roll, Andy throws in artistic freedom which in my opinion is a huge plus! The rolls are loose and large, which while may be offsetting to some, works perfectly for me! Additionally, Andy is very good with off menu items, so go ahead and ask whatever you would like  As many others said, the interaction with Andy really makes it!",

It's... just... not that good.    It all snapped into place for me one day recently.  The sushi rolls he makes are massive, but the taste just isn't there.  He's rushing to make them so fast that as soon as you put your chopsticks around them they completely fall apart.  And the most important part, the fish, doesn't seem all that fresh.  Definitely not as fresh as Penn Ave., which is weird considering he \"lives\" in a fresh fish mecca.  But the thing I think I've really grown to hate that weird brown sauce he puts on everything.  Yuck!  I just can't stand it!  I know I can ask to have it off, but as soon as I seem to remember, it's on there in a flash.  I know it may be cheap and it may be fast, but to me it's just not worth it.  Penn Ave IS right down the street...and I PROMISE you'll love their fresh and delicious sushi!",

Let me just say that having a chance to chat with Andy is also a part of your luncheon experience.    I went with the Sushi lunch special which gives you a nice mix of salmon, tuna, and shrimp. The portion is great, fresh fish is a dream and the presentation is a plus.  Plus Andy is not shy about handing out free sushi while he prepares plates. He loads up the hot sauces an makes it fun. I recommend this the next time you visit the strip.",

There is no dine in option, only sushi to-go and prices are very very reasonable compared to the sushi restaurant down the street. Andy is very friendly, pleasant with good energy. I normally don't make small talk, but he was fun to joke around with. I was looking for a sushi place in the strip district and was lucky to have found this place. It's located inside Wholey's seafood market and right there as soon as you enter the doors. There was no line for me - lucky me! But right when he was finishing my order there were at least four groups in line for sushi. People don't seem to mind the wait. I ordered several nigiri pieces, my usual. The texture of the nigiri pieces felt fresh to me and the rice was not overpowering and actually tasted good - rice wasn't too sticky, hard or soggy. Eel nigiri is always good because of the sauce, but I was just reminded how good it was after trying it at Andy's - it was a pretty meaty eel nigiri piece too! It was also my first time trying toro (fatty tuna) - which looked seared on the outside and raw on the inside - it tasted good and I would order it again if I come back to Pittsburgh. Most places don't serve toro seared.  He also packed his special spicy sauce along with the order - I think there's sirarcha in it, but not sure what else - it was my first time trying it and I definitely would prefer it more than regular soy sauce.",

Its quite big for a roll and he likes to incorporate a lot of non traditional flavors, like mango, various fried things, and several types of sauces.   Does the sushi sometimes fall apart.. yes but the taste is pretty good for the price.  Where it kind of falls apart for me is everything else.  First his stall is located right next to the door so if any sort of line forms you are constantly being bumped into by people walking in or asked to move by workers restocking the crab... Also its in a fish market so there is an overpowering smell of fish at all times  The next downfall is the overall cleanliness.  I would imagine that a lot of kitchens look a bit dirty, but they are usually hidden.  If you have a stall where you can see every inch, keeping it pristine should be a priority.   The last issue I had maybe just me being miserable at work.  That being said sometimes I just wanted to get sushi without the Andy show, chit-chat, and questions.  I get it, its part of the \"experience\" and most people that have been there once or twice will likely disagree, but sometimes its just a bit much, especially if u went as much as i did and realized its the same skit over and over again.  Would I mind if i was having a leisurely stroll, no, but if ur coming on your lunch break sometimes silence is golden.  Overall though I would recommend it!",

Last Sunday, as I walked by Andy's in Wholey's for the hundredth time, I finally decided to stop - and my expectations were definitely met!  Andy is charismatic, charming, and funny. He made light conversation and playfully poked fun at us, while smoothly maneuvering around his compact work space. While we waited for our two rolls, he offered us each tastes of a spring roll, which was delicious.  While Andy's had two very creative options as specials, I ordered a spicy california roll, which is my go-to, and a roll I usually order when I want to try a new place. This roll was f r e s h - delicious, crunchy cucumber and creamy avocado really made it special.  My partner ordered the special - a spicy tuna roll with kiwi. I've never considered kiwi a sushi ingredient, but it added a great bite to the roll, and was really delicious.  tl;dr - Andy's is delicious, priced right, and with its location in Wholey's and Andy's charisma, it's truly a \"Pittsburgh\" experience.",

I get to order, (I'm in the medical field) already like why is this guy touching all this dirty cash and then touching food? Ok I'm going to move pass this because the rest is worse. Even though that's already disgusting.  I don't want hepatitis A or shigella.  I order Andy's special roll, I leave.  I start eating it and it's so dry and unpalatable.  I look at it after I ate two bites and realize this isn't what I ordered.  Went back, he literally gives me so much guff. Then argues it's the right roll.  I'm like it has no avocado or \"caviar\" as stated on the menu !!!! PS green masago is not caviar !!!!  He then said well I am only giving you half a roll since you are two pieces. Okay whatever dude, just make it the right roll.  So what's he do, gives me literally the toughest parts of the salmon closest to the skin.  Petty.  And obviously can't eat it anyways.  See my pictures.  Did I mention the sushi rice is just regular white rice? Like is this guy really pawning off this unsanitary horrible tasting rice roll as sushi?  So break it down... 1.) Can dept of health come see this guy? 2.) Petty rude awful customer service, god forbid he makes an error because you will pay. 3.) Rice is not sushi rice.  Just plain ol rice. 4.) Look at that piece of salmon... disgusting.",

It is a fantastic fit for Wholey's and Andy's !!  I didn't think to take a picture, but I will the next trip. I do love Wholey's Cod Sandwiches, but Andy's is become more a favorite.   A must is the Philly Roll, I like the Pittsburgh, but the Philly is my favorite. I like the Rainbow the fishes; tuna and salmon with the red snapper make it for me. I have yet to try the Andy's Special Roll. I do love caviar !   I like that you can watch him make the rolls in front of you. I can see the fresh fish and ingredients  The prices are comparable to other places in the area. Good Food at a great price.   Highly Recommend !!",

It's been over a year since I started going to Andy to fulfill my undying need for sushi and sashimi and each visit is just as pleasant as the next.  The Philly roll is always a go-to for me, and then I usually choose some other roll to complete my order. Andy always has specials of some sort going on. The sushi is made right in front of you and the ingredients have never been anything less than fresh. One other noteworthy quality of Andy's Sushi Bar is the atmosphere he creates. He makes everyone feel like his friend and is incredibly welcoming and fun. You never know what to expect, but it's always great!",

I figured sushi shops inside markets would be subpar because there are so many examples of that (Whole Foods, HEB, Wegmans).  This spot is different for many reasons:  1) fresh fish from Wholey 2) no pre-packaged sushi 3) high energy sushi chef Andy 4) fair priced and delicious sushi  We got 4 rolls for lunch and that was way plenty of food.  I really liked the spicy tuna kiwi roll (special).  It's a mouthful but the kiwi is balanced out by the shiso leaf very well.  I also like that he added two types of tuna in the roll (regular and albacore).  My boyfriend liked the salmon mango roll but I thought the sauce was too sweet and overwhelming.  The dynamic roll was good, full of fresh raw fish.  I also asked Andy to make a squid roll with shiso leaf (my new obsession) but he forgot the shiso!  Wholey has an upstairs with plenty of seating.  But when the weather is nice, I wouldn't mind getting it to go and head down to point state park for some sushi picnic.  I'm really impressed with the amount of fish Andy gives in each roll.  He's upbeat, friendly, and a good chef to be around!",

The food is takeout-only. He moves quick, and so does his line.   Andy's sushi rolls seem to be the specialty, but he does nigiri, sashimi, hand rolls, and spring rolls as well.  Do not be discouraged if you see his stand closed. Andy goes on long vacations. He always comes back.   You will too.",

The space is quite small with jut enough room for him to stand in but the flavors and love this man has in his food couldn't be bigger! Andy made me several kinds of sushi and I was blown away by it all. Andy said he has been making sushi for over 30 years and you can believe it.

First, let me say that I can be a bit of a hand washing freak, but for good reason. I've seen the bacteria that grows from door knobs, cash and elevator buttons and would prefer not to consume any of that. Anyone handling cash and preparing food needs to wash their hands between EVERY transaction which is something Andy did not do. I know he gets busy and he's a sweet guy but even he needs to follow one of the basic rules of food prep.   Now, to the sushi...I went for a basic salmon roll and chose a shrimp roll as my second selection. The fish was just okay. I mean I guess I expected to really be wowed since I was in Robert Wholey's \"house\" but I wasn't. The rice was mushy, not sticky, and it didn't hold together. I like my rolls tight! I want the flavors to explode in my mouth like POW...yeah, that's it...that's how I like it.

It's also fun to tell him to make you a surprise roll and see what you get if you're in the mood for something new and different... just don't be surprised when you see the total! I make it a point to bring all of my friends that have never tried his sushi down there because it is simply that good. Around lunch time, between 12 and 130, expect to have a little bit of a wait, but after, it's quick with how he makes everything if you're short on time.",
