When we ate at Mt Nebo in July 2017, we noticed the dishes were significantly spicier than the same ones we had previously. We happen to like spicy so it was great for us, but we were happy we took the server's advice and chose lower numbers for spice levels. The outside atmosphere is great at both places. We will return.",

We had pork buns that came out first, a delicious salad that came out shortly after the buns and then our entrees arrived as we finished the salad.  We had 2 of the specials and another dish from the regular menu....everything was very well prepared and delicious.  A few times while we were eating, a young woman came around to ask how everything was...it was a little odd in that she didn't seem very interested in what our reaction was but it was a nice attempt to make sure everything was OK.  Our waiter was attentive and helpful.  We had ordered takeout from Nicky's shortly after they opened and it was somewhat of a disaster. It took quite a long time for the food to come out and although it was very good, the wait was a little too much so we have waited a while to try it again.  This time it couldn't have been much better...we will return!",

Wasn't starving so ordered the Tom Kha soup and their crispy chicken wings with basil. Friends order other dishes. The other reviewers complained about the service, but we NEVER had any problems. We were seated immediately and were served by no less than 3 people, including the very pleasant waitress who was from their downtown location. Everything came fresh and hot, and the water glasses were kept filled. The only small issues I have were with the large cabbage leaves in the Tom Kha - have never seen this ingredient in this soup before, and it seemed a little off-putting - and the Crispy Thai Chicken Wings could have been crispier. But the flavor of everything else was delicious and, all-in-all, would not hesitate to go back.",

I've only eaten in 4 times there but usually get take out. My girlfriend usually can break her Pad Thai down into 3 meals and bring for lunch.

It took her quite a while to come back for our order as she was working the outside patio too.  Our food was excellent though some dinners were not very hot.  I did ask our server for a glass of ice and she never brought it.  She also didn't come back to check to see if everything was ok with our dinners until we had eaten almost half of them.  Lucky for us the food was good.  Major complaint was the NOISE!  It is extremely loud and noisy there.  If you want to sit and talk with your companions, this is not the place.  I felt like I was at a rock concert after being in there for a while.  My ears were still ringing when we left!  They need to put carpet on the floor to absorb the noise better.",

Everyone at the table ordered appetizers, I started with crab rangoon. I was very disappointed when everyone at my table's appetizers came, I had to wait about 5 more minutes for mine. Ok, mistakes can be made. The crab rangoon was just ok, very creamy, very sweet, absolutely no crab or even crab flavor. I had just barely finished my appetizer when everyone's dinner entrees arrived. Well, everyone's but mine. Had to wait about 10 minutes for the entree. Now I'm pretty upset, as are the rest of my dinner companions. No one ever came over to explain why my meal was the only one that hadn't arrived, nor did anyone come over to ask if everything was ok. When it finally did arrive, the spice level was underwhelming. I normally order a 4 out of 10, but Nicky's scale only goes to 5, so I ordered 2 (simple math, right?) Wrong! had hardly any spice whatsoever. I really wanted to love this place and was VERY DISAPPOINTED, especially since the food was a little better than average. I will stick with other Thai places. I would not recommend this place. Food was ok, service was subpar, prices were high.",

Three meals ran about $45. Which is a bit on the pricey end and is no big deal if the quality is there. Two orders of pad Thai and an order or kao soy. Everything ordered at heat levels 2 & 3 (out of 5) Nothing was spicy. The flavor of the pad Thai was ok. The chicken was very poor quality. Lots of gristle and very dry. The kao soy had good flavor, there just wasn't a lot of it. Small portion at full price. The noodles that come on the top are supposed to be crispy. Other places will package this part separately for a take out-out order, they did not do this. This dish, as with all the others, seemed to be lacking the chicken we ordered them to be made with... very little chicken. This certainly wasn't the best Thai I have ever had.

The lunch includes the entree and either a soup or salad mostly priced under $10. They typically have chicken noodle soup which is like no other chicken noodle I have ever tasted. There is a hint of ginger and other flavors to the soup which makes it delicious. I have tired the pad thai along with various curries. They are all delicious but my personal favorites are the pineapple curry and the massaman curry. When we first started going (about a year ago) I would get a spice level of 1 but have built up to a 3. I am not usually one to like spicy food but the mix of the spiciness and the sweetness of the curry is amazing. My husband loves the garlic chicken and the ginger chicken. They always include a crab rangoon with each entree. This is a nice touch and they are delicious. The decor is very pretty and they have a beautiful outdoor eating area for nicer weather. The staff there is wonderful. There is one particularly sweet waitress who remembers us each time we come in.",

The Tom Ka soup is great!!!!  Very flavorful and full of vegetables!!  I have place some large take out orders to really try some of the dishes (still afraid to get shrimp though LOL!)  All good.  I will say they are very inconsistent with spice level.  One chef makes a 3 like a level 5 and the next time a 3 is like a 1 (reason for the 4 stars).  I will return to get my Thai fix.",

This is Pittsburgh, not brooklyn. I come from Los Angeles and I lived in Thai Town, and I would try every single place that would open there, and I would say Nicky's in on par with some of them for being a little bit fusion inspired but never have I ever paid this much for thai food. The only way to feel good about it is dining inside for their lunch specials I've learned. My days of take out are over. Their pad thai is definitely on the fish side of taste too, which I'm not such a fan of. I asked for extra peanut on my pad thai once and they charged me extra without mentioning it.",

    "text": "I was very disappointed with our dining experience at this location. I walked up to the hostess desk and tried to make eye contact with one of the two working there. Neither one of them acknowledged me standing there for a couple of minutes. They were busy, but a simple \"I'll be right with you\" would have been nice. It was a nice evening, so we decided to sit on the patio, which was really pretty! We sat there for 20 minutes with no one approaching or acknowledging us. Two waiters walked past us several times and both even looked right at me, but neither one stopped or even said a word. Finally, after 20 minutes, I went to find a manager. I found him serving tables inside. Not sure if he is a server who is also a manager, in which case would explain the lack of supervision on the dining floor, or if he was just helping out as they seemed short staffed and under trained. I explained that we had been sitting there for 20 minutes without so much as a \"hello,\" or \"I'll be right with you\" (this makes all the difference!)  As I was talking to him, we were interrupted by a man who told the manager, \"this is the worse dining experience I have ever had!\" I left hose two to talk. Even after my short conversation with the manager, it still took several more minutes for someone to come take our order. The table next to us made a comment about how inattentive the wait staff was. While we were eating our dinner, (at this point we had been there for over an hour) a couple walked past us and the man said, \"I had to give the manager a piece of my mind!\"  There was no apology from the server or management. No offer to remove the one glass of wine off our bill. No offer of a dessert for the three of us to split. Nothing. Not even a \"thank you for coming!\" These small gestures make all the difference in pleasing dissatisfied customers. Get it together Nicky's! People are talking!",

    "text": "As a long-time fan of the downtown Nicky's, I was so excited to see that a location was opening up literally down the hill from my parents' house. The suburbanites NEED access to delicious non-chain restaurants, and without much or any Thai in the area, I thought this would be perfect.  But it was.... well, one of the most mixed-bags of all the mixed-bags I've ever experienced.  The terrific:  ~ The ambiance. It is BEAUTIFULLY decorated, very ornate and yet somehow cozy. The restroom smells of earthy incense that takes me back to my college dorm room. Even the wood on the tables is pleasant: smooth but rustic and just very calming in general. They have a lovely outdoor seating area that is fitted with those tall heat lamp thingies, so you can enjoy your meal outside even when it's chilly.  ~ The food. And let's be honest, this is the number one reason you're going to visit Nicky's. We had the Thai toast, which was that lovely mix of crispy and gooey and hearty. The Tiger Cry Beef was fantastic and not as spicy as the name might imply. And the entrees were a good size, where I didn't feel overwhelmed after a round of small plates, but I also had enough leftover to wrap up for lunch the next day. The soup portions are GIGANTIC, and you can certainly make a meal of small plates and appetizers and be very content.  The okay: ~ The alcohol situation. It is both BYOB and full-service bar. Because of this, the corkage fee is $10 per wine bottle, instead of $5, like their Northside location. And as far as we could tell (at least on the night we recently visited), there was not a dedicated bartender, but servers running back and forth to the bar to grab drinks. It was just strange and a little confusing and not the fastest situation.  And now for, The really not cool: ~ The service. And it's not why you think!! Our server was as pleasant and friendly and accommodating as could be. However, service was..... slow. Painfully slow. First, they lost our reservation. They fixed that up reasonably quickly, but then no one even came to our table to open our wine bottles or bring water for 25 minutes. I think we just got lost in the shuffle, so we didn't 'belong' to any server. I don't think the server we eventually had was 'supposed to' be ours. When we were there, it just seemed chaotic, like no one was dedicated to running the bar, greeting customers at the door, or waiting tables.  Everyone was SO DANG NICE but they all seemed panicked and disorganized and stressed well beyond their limits. I wanted to be like, 'hey, while we are waiting, show me what I can do to help, give me some plates to deliver.'   ~ The parking. YIKES. I know it's a hot and popular spot right now, but husband had to circle the lot 4-5 times to get a space. They do a lot of takeout business here as well (which was contributing to the staffing confusion it seemed), so the parking lot is full of way more cars than seem to match the capacity of humans inside the building.  I know they are a new restaurant, and I really think that's all it is. They are working out the kinks, getting adjusted to how one deals with a sudden swarm of business. The truth is, they are one of only like 3 sit-down restaurants in the immediate area, and the only one serving Thai food, so I think everyone is rushing in to check it out, and perhaps the management didn't plan for quite such a huge turnout.  The food is excellent, and the servers are sweet as can be, but I think the workflow needs some improvement for this to keep up with the high standard of the other Nicky's. I'm sure we will be back, but I think we will give it a few months for them to get more settled into the flow of traffic. But if you're in the North Hills and not spoiled by having restaurant options all over the place like we cityfolk are, set aside a long block of time and bring a couple of bottles of wine and come on down.",

We ordered a bunch of food and split it all so we could figure out what is hit or miss. The Massaman Curry and Tom Khai Ga were two of the best versions I've ever had and I try every Tom Khai that I can find. The crab rangoon and Pad Thai were both also fantastic. However, the crab fried rice, chicken satay, Thai style dumplings were all just okay. The service was fantastic and our server was incredibly helpful in suggesting and explaining dishes to my mom, who had never had Thai before.   We got here right at 5pm and I would suggest doing the same or dining at off hours. Looking through the reviews for this place, most of the complaints seem to be around wait time and service. By the time we left at 6:15 the place was packed and there were 10 or so people waiting at the front. They seemed understaffed so I can see where these complaints are valid.",

Not one of them stopped at our table. Not one of them would even look at us. After sitting there for 20 minutes being blatantly ignored, we walked out.

The wall decorations, tableware, serving bowls are all gold. The vast menu is pure Thai, with all of the standard items you expect plus a number of others, and a long list of specials. It might be a little too much choice for those of us who are indecisive. It's also a lot to expect from the kitchen. Our dinners were pretty good - pad Thai and cashew shrimp with the samosa appetizer- pretty standard stuff. Spice levels were as expected but be advised that they use a 5 point scale not the more typical 10 point version. There is a pretty good wine list with adequate choice and fair prices. Service, which many reviewers criticized, was good, if a little unusual. The restaurant was nearly empty, so the servers were not stressed. We were served by at least 5 different people. Overall Nicky's is a pretty good weekday dinner choice. I would avoid the weekends until the service issues are completely resolved.",

    "text": "Yikes.... some harsh reviews for a location that JUST opened!!!  Hopefully people will give them a second chance, because Nicky's in Mount Nebo could be good - especially with how well their other locations do!  I have no idea what this building used to be before they remodeled, but Nicky's newest location is still so fresh, you can still smell the reconstruction of it when you walk in!  It is clean and beautifully decorated with gem tone & gold decor and has a really pretty outdoor patio.  I came here last Monday with my dad for lunch - it is conveniently located to our office, just 10 minutes away.  There were only a few other tables occupied, but I noticed during our lunch that a few people came in to place takeout orders with the hostess.  Maybe because the phones are not yet working, as other reviews might suggest.  I ordered the Phad See Eaw with veggies at a spice level 3.  My dad ordered [cant remember the name but it was] the one under  the Phad See Eaw with thin noodles in a garlic sauce at a spice level 3.  Lunch comes with either soup or salad.  I chose the soup (chicken rice) and Dad had the salad.  Both were good.  Our food was good. Mine better than his.  His had zero spice. Mine was making me sweat.  Slightly inconsistent. Large portions for the lunch price.  I like their Pad Thai so I would probably order that next time.  Both meals came with one of their amazing crab rangoon.  Our service wasn't bad, our waiter was pretty dry and monotonous, but he took care of us.  Two things, though: the lights - not sure if they had a short - but were flickering on and off the entire time and also....the music.  It needs to be turned down or the selection needs changed because both of our heads were banging by the time we left!  I'd like to come back once they have a few kinks figured out because i think this location has great potential - plus I'd love to sit on the patio next time!",

    "text": "My wife and I came to Nicky's on a whim.  She had lunch from this location in the past.  We arrived around 6:15PM.  We were greeted and sat quickly.  That's when the wait(s) began.  About 15 minutes after being seated, the waitress came and asked if we had been helped.  We weren't alone in the back of the restaurant. We were seated in the main aisle way.  We ordered our food, my wife, a noodle curry dish, ($13.50) and myself, the \"Jalapeno,\" with shrimp ($15.50) The shrimp was an upcharge.  We also ordered a house salad to split, as my wife raves about it.($7.95)  Our salad came after an additional 10 minute wait.  We finished it and our waitress stopped and made small talk about the dressing.  It was delicious.  An iceberg lettuce with mango, pineapple, carrots, and crushed peanuts and a house made dressing that was like a looser duck sauce.  Our salad plates were taken, and again, the wait.  After 30 minutes another member of the wait staff said our food should be out shortly.  It came about 8 minutes later.  My wife's dish was well played in a decorative bowl, with a ladle and spoon.  The sauce / food ratio was excellent.    Mine was served in a large soup bowl, with a very small portion of rice on the side. There was a lot more food / sauce than rice. The most disappointing observance at this point were the five (5) shrimp in the dish.  They were small shrimp that had not been tailed.   The food was delicious.  I asked for a 3 out of 5 for spiciness, and the dish was dead on.  After scooping two spoons of rice, my serving bowl was empty.    We had not seen a waiter or waitress for some time, our water glasses were empty.  I finally flagged down our waitress and asked for some additional rice.  She said it was an extra $2.95.  I declined.  Our water glasses remained empty.  We finished our meal and requested the check.  Another wait.  Finally we were cashed out and paid.  Sorry Nicky's.  The food was delicious, but the small portions, up-charges, and poor service will keep me from returning.   Try the Silk Elephant or Noodlehead if you're looking for Thai in Pittsburgh.",

Skeptical of suburban spots with weaker spice, I ordered a 4/5 and I got a mighty pleasant punch of spice in my dish. Vegetables were bountiful and cooked perfectly in my opinion. There was slightly less squid than I would have hoped but the pieces I got were delicious. If you're not willing to deal with downtown parking and traffic the Mt. Nebo location will deliver the freshness and spice you desire.",

Don't expect to blow through either. This is a sit down, relax and enjoy your meal.  If you want fast this is not the place for you. But if you want a nice experience with authentic Thai food you will be pleased.  The staff is pleasant and the food is awesome.  Try anything, it's all good. I particularly enjoy the green curry.  On a scale of 1 to 5, 3 is spicy. 4 will make you sweat, but wash it down with their traditional ice tea. Don't scrimp on desert. The Mango with sticky rice and ice cream is refreshing.  It is best to make reservations, especially for parties of 5 or more.",

    "text": "Fellow Yelp friends got us hooked on Nicky's so we were very excited to hear that they opened up a location closer to us.  We stopped in for lunch on a Monday.  They place had a nice little lunch crowd when we got there and it grew as our meal continued.    They have a large indoor seating area for dinner, with a small bar area.  They also have a small outside seating area.  The service here is fast, efficient and prompt.    We ordered the crispy egg rolls and steamed dumplings for appetizers.  Both came out quickly and tasted really good.  Our meal also came with a small house salad which was decent.  When you order your entrees you can get them on a spice level of 1-5, with 5 being the hottest.  I ordered spicy peanut with beef on a level 3.  The spice level was decent, not as hot as I would have liked, but I know better for the next time.  The better half had the pad phet with shrimp at a level 4.  Definitely had a nice little kick to it, but she too wanted more spice.  We are into spicy foods so take our recommendations with a grain of salt, the level 3 did have some heat as did the level 4.  Both dishes tasted great.  Overall this was a good place for lunch and I would imagine dinner as well. I find that I liked the atmosphere at the Nicky's on the North Side to be better, but this place still delivers.  I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I must say that I find the few reviews for Nicky's new location to be harsh, so I hope others that have had a good experience like me take to Yelp and post about it, although I think Nicky's is doing just fine by word of mouth with its business. I visited as a party of 5 at around 1pm on a Friday, and the dining room was filled with about 10-12 other parties besides us. The location is great, IMO, because the restaurant options in the immediate area are rather slim. My parents live a short drive from here, so we decided to go here for lunch after my parents enjoyed a previous lunch experience here.   The building used to be Recipes Remembered, and then it was a potential Chinese restaurant that was never finished. The building had been vacant for a few years and then, one day, Nicky's opened pretty quickly. This was my first time at any of the (now) three locations in Pittsburgh. The patio is beautifully decorated and would be an ideal dining spot on any non-rainy day. The inside, where we sat, is ornately decorated with lots of gold, glittering tapestries, and colorful paintings. There is a room in the back paneled in wood with a bar and a TV. While there was a hostess, we were seated by a friendly woman who ended up being our server.   A friendly young man brought us waters while we perused the menu. Our server was extremely helpful in assisting my mother with ordering since, due to her shellfish allergy, she cannot have anything with shellfish or products like oyster sauce, which is actually found in more dishes than you would think. She was also helpful when my dad asked for suggestions under the \"chef's special\" section, pointing out the spicier dishes. Soon after she took our orders, everything started to arrive.   My mom and dad ordered Thai iced teas and really enjoyed them. All of the lunch meals are served with either salad or soup. The soup of the day on this visit was chicken rice. It was flavorful and spicy with plentiful amounts of rice and chicken. It came out hot which was perfect on this cooler day. The salad had a pineapple dressing with crushed peanuts and included tomatoes, cucumbers, mango, pineapple, carrots, and onions. I really enjoyed the sweet dressing and the added crunch/saltiness of the peanuts.  For entrees our table ordered: 1. Wild curry with chicken- this was my meal and I loved it! I ordered a 4 (out of 5) and found it to have a very nice spice to it (cleared my sinuses!) but was not so spicy I ever felt uncomfortable. The dish included a variety of veggies: bamboo shoots, mushrooms, snap peas, red and green peppers, corn, eggplant, green beans, basil leaves, and many herbed spices that provided a delectable flavor profile overall. The chicken was plentiful, and I was more than pleased with the lunch sized portion.  2. Pad thai with chicken- my mom and fiance both ordered this dish, and my mom's was made without oyster sauce and not garnished with the crab rangoon.  My mom ordered at a 3 and she found it to be quite flavorful, the chicken was tender, and she still had leftovers to take home with her. My fiance ordered his at a 4, and thought it was perfect with a kick but not overpowering. He felt the dish was a bit heavy on the purple cabbage in the dish.   3. Sriracha spicy noodles with chicken-My brother ordered this at a 4 and thought it was flavorful but really spicy, which is what he wanted. He said if anyone orders this be prepared for heavy spice.  4. Pad phet combo-My dad ordered this and it had chicken, beef, pork, and shrimp with wide noodles and a spicy sauce. He ordered a 3 and said it was flavorful and very tasty.  While the food was excellent, the service added to make this a 5 star dining experience! Our server was attentive, friendly, and efficient throughout our meal. The atmosphere here is really nice and we were never rushed even though we had finished eating but were still conversing. The plate presentations are also beautiful, and I loved the little crab rangoon garnish atop the rice (on my plate) or the carrot garnish (on the other plates). I have no complaints about the noise as there was not much of any during our visit even though the dining room was crowded. I did find the lights that were flickering to be slightly distracting, as another reviewer noted. Also, I found it interesting all of the servers and the hostess were wearing phones, presumably because they are all responsible for answering it. While neither of these two things led to a bad experience, they are just something to note. I'd definitely recommend dining in here for the full experience, and I will definitely return upon my subsequent visits to the Burgh.",

    "text": "Nicky's downtown location is amazing, great atmosphere and food; so I thought this location would be the same. It was not the same food standard. The place is absolutely beautiful I love the ambiance. The service was okay kind of slow, but it was packed and busy on a Saturday night. The menu is plentiful and diverse, full of delicious choices. I enjoyed the spring rolls. They have a unique unexpected Indian spice to them, similar to Samosas. My green curry with shrimp was not up to par. The shrimp was completely overcooked tough and rubbery. It also was NOT fully deveined?! The curry was flavorful but seemed to be low on vegetables. My friend and I were also only given one side of rice between us even though we both ordered curries and should have each had our own. I was so excited for this new location to open, but was sadly disappointed with my visit. I might give the place another try in a few months. More likely to return to the downtown location.  *update I did return & had a much better experience. I stuck to chicken though!",

The curry was dense, so it was definitely better eaten as a dip, than as a sip.   Their pineapple margarita was also good, compared to other places. For $8, it was pretty worth it.   They have really nice outdoor seating in this location. It's a great spot to have lunch/dinner at their outside seating on a nice day.   Their service was pretty good. The girl serving us was nice but rushed everything every time she came to us. Otherwise, every other server was very attentive and helpful, constantly refilling our water.   Overall, decent place!",

Both the appetizer and the margarita were awesome. I loved getting a taste of a couple different vegetarian appetizers, all of which were delicious.   Next, I ordered tofu with peanut sauce and steamed vegetables. It was good, but nothing special compared to other Thai restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. My friend ordered a curry dish that I cannot remember or find the name of, but that was the best entree. My other friend ordered the Noodle Sriracha, which was good.   Overall, the food was good, but the prices are relatively high compared to other Thai restaurants. My bill ended up substantially higher than what I would pay at most of the other Thai restaurants I have been to for food that was not any different, and if anything the portion sizes were smaller than other places. Most entrees run from about $14-$16 compared to the $12-14 I am used to, which ends up making a pretty big difference.",

Both items were very good. I think you would be hard pressed to find better thai food in Pittsburgh.    If you're in the mood for Thai food. You should definitely check this place out.   I would like to make one suggestion to the owners. The cash register at the bar makes this crazy loud beep every time it prints a receipt.  It gets really annoying when you're sitting at the bar.",

    "text": "On Sunday, was craving Thai and had having visited Nicky's in the Northside a while back, I remember how delicious the food was.   We got there a little after 5pm, and found out that from 5-7 they had a free appetizer, eggrolls or crab rangoon, as well as $5 Cosmos. The atmosphere was nice, it wasn't crowded and the patio looked like it would be great to enjoy in the summer.  We started off with the egg rolls and ordered the Garlic entree with pork (comes with white rice) and the Spicy Noodles with chicken. I also ordered a Chai Iced Tea. Out of their spice level 1-5, we both had a 3 which we asked and found out was similar to a Jalapeno. It was good, but we like spicy so we probably should've gone higher.  The staff was very friendly and overall everything was great. I would definitely recommend Nicky's and will be back for sure.",

    "text": "First I would strongly recommend making a reservation if you plan on going for dinner! They have an extensive menu and if you've never had Thai before, don't worry you'll find something to eat. I started with the won ton soup. You get a big bowl with 4-5 won tons. Very tasty but you have to like cilantro. The weird thing is they give you a small spoon, not a soup spoon.  It filled me up. Next we ordered the sample appetizer. Has 5 different items, good size choice if you're not sure what to order next time.  My friend ordered the fried rice gluten free and it was enough for 2 meals.  Everything came out hot.  They explained what the sauces were and which item they were to be paired with.  It was a little loud but not too bad. This isn't a quick in and meal.... they do take some time to serve your food.  Will be back to try other things.",
