I have been going there since I was in highschool and all in all it's solid food nothing exciting but you get what you paid for.   This resturant has a lot of sentimental value for me. In this resturant  my boyfriend first said he loved me. So Golden Palace Buffet will always have a special place in my heart.    The food is okay I especially like their combination lo-mien I have never had any of their speciality menu selections.  I enjoy their hot and sour soup and orange chicken is tasty hunan shrimp and beef and brocoli.   For Chinese food downtown it's pretty okay",

However, it has really good authentic Chinese dishes and lunch boxes, if you order from the menu. You get a lot of food for the money you pay, and some of them are cooked in a healthy and light way. I'd recommend the soy sauce chicken and roasted duck. They have bigger portion for takeout or appetizer and smaller portion for lunch boxes. They usually put broccoli in the lunch box, but you can ask them to change it to something else if they have.",

Maybe even a little extra depending on the service. 15% if you truly sucked. (To Blunt?) That's my philopshy, you get what you work for. Long story short, he leaves amazing tips, and ranted and raved about this place, leading us to this review. He always says leave an amazing tip, they will remember you every time, and you'll get amazing service every time. Well don't ya know? This old Asian women lights up when he comes in. He hasn't been there in over a year. We order our food, he ordered the dumplings, and general tso's. I ordered the roasted duck and the egg rolls. Now I wish I would of gotten what he had, their dumplings, yes were a little greasy as were the egg rolls, but what do you expect? It's a chinese buffet. His general tso's on the other hand amazing as were the dumplings, which reminded me more of pot stickers but any-hoo. My roasted duck, was a little bit of a disappointment. I don't mind a few bones, but there was bone after bone, it was very hard to eat. Talk about rustic chinese food. I'd go back but I wouldn't order the duck, dry and no sauce.",

I've never ordered from the buffet (it doesn't look too good), but they make an a-ok congee (no donuts, unfortunately), reasonably good roast duck & pork, and the fish maw soup is also very nice.  It's near my work and I like coming here for a late lunch when it's not crowded. The interior is kind of beat (drop-ceiling, battered furniture, etc), but I really like the laid-back atmosphere.   This is my favorite place for a secret 90-minute leisurely lunch on a weekday with friends and sharing a few dishes. Just arrive after 1pm!",

The fried tofu is good and is coated in a fairly unique batter. The other dishes are less notable but fairly tasty. Preparation and presentation is a kinda coarse. My friends and I usually ordered from a small subset of the menu: fried tofu, salt and pepper pork chops, salt and pepper squid, some pig intestine dish I forget the name of, char siu pork, 8 treasure clay pot.  Tip: If you're picky, ask the waitress when the char siu was made. Being Pittsburgh, it may take a few days before the old batch is finished and the new batch is prepared.  The Golden Palace in downtown has the same food and owners.",

First it's only a one row buffet with like 10 things on it and no dessert for children.  The food was cold when they brought hot food they just put it with the cold food without removing it.  Than in the corner is a ton of dirty dishes stacked from the floor all the way up to someone's average shoulder.  The food was horrible and either extra salty... Cold... Or fried in son disgusting batter I've never tasted before. I literally did the unthinkable when I spit out my food in front of children bc I just couldn't get it down.  I love Chinese but damn.  If you have to suffer through the buffet please go to the rice and the general tso which I'm not a huge fan of but it was the best thing since the wonton soup was even overcooked noodles.  On the buffet is salty asparagus,  hot and sour soup,  wonton soup, broccoli and chicken,  some type of disgusting pork chops, rice,  lo mein chow mein,  fruit, some super fried mushrooms,  and those sugar don't things with salt on top as well.  That is all... And I am now sick from this food so I hope u run from this place.",

Rather, the conversation was \"I cannot believe you have worked in Oakland for 6 years and have never gone here.  We went here every Friday!\"  and when venturing out to lunch today without a plan, I suggested this place.  Worth a shot I guess.  My first impression was the cantaloupe - it was good and in season.  But ok...getting to the actual Chinese food...      I had the chicken and broccoli, the general tso's, an egg roll, some of their fried mushrooms with sweet and sour sauce, some vegetable lo mien, a 'biscuit', and some fried dumpling with a creamy filling that tasted somewhat like onions.    Overall very good.  The lo mien and the mushrooms were the best.  The 'biscuit' is the 'Chinese donut' type - spongy with sugar. It was typical.  The general tso's was surprisingly good.  To me, general tso's is often too gooped up in sweet and sour sauce with rubbery chicken that tastes like it was microwaved.  No, this was pretty good.  The egg roll...yeah that's the only thing I wasn't a huge fan of, but overall, $6.26 for a full buffet and a drink.  You can't beat that, AND now I've found a Chinese buffet that actually has decent food.   Yay.  For reference, there were a bunch of Asian people eating there - I tend to use that as a marker for how authentic/edible the food is.   I like to think I'd be a pretty good judge of pizza or hamburgers in China if the tables were turned.",

There is nothing fancy about the place; this is not one of the huge, sparkling clean, modern Chinese buffets which offer hundreds of choices and the restaurant does not attract an elite clientele for the most part, but its 20 or so dishes, including soups, are awfully good with a touch of uniqueness!   I love the chow fun wide noodles, sweet tofu in sauce, chicken with broccoli, mixed vegetables, egg roll, breaded chicken, and breaded mushrooms.  For the bargain lunch price of $8.00 including tax, one can enjoy a feast, and credit cards are now accepted!  I also appreciated the pleasant and welcoming demeanor of the middle aged lady who worked the front register.  I wish I had more of an opportunity to dine here!",

As others comments have mentioned, more greasy and oily than expected. Do not get too much meat and try to have veges to \"neutralize.\" Rice noodle is a great choice if you have too much meat like me.  Anyway, you cannot criticize a $7 buffet that is as good as this one.",

However, there are other places that are better for Chinese food. Save your money.",

    "text": "I just returned to the Golden Palace after TEN YEARS.  I went to Pitt and lived in South Oakland from 2005-2009.  Golden Palace was a staple to my friends and I.  I personally had lunch or dinner there at least once a week, and never had a bad or mediocre experience.    On the day of my unexpected return, I had to make a run to the Amazon lockers to grab a hard drive for work. I passed the old restaurant on the bus and thought I would circle back and have a trip down memory lane on the kind of food I was craving anyway.    Sure enough, the food at Golden Palace is still as spectacular as I remember!  I frequent buffets and to this day haven't found a General Tso's that is this right.  And the green beans and lo mein were made me feel like I was 19 again.    Do not let the appearance of the place fool you.  The food is wonderful.  The buffet is not gigantic, like a large, flashy buffet.  This is because they focus on making the dishes they do offer extra good.  I saw the same smiling faces and hard workers there that I remember from back in the day.  Hard working immigrants are what make this country so great.    Golden Palace still has it, a decade later.  They continue to offer the Oakland student and worker population with a reliable, consistent, and delicious Chinese cuisine at a great price.",

The price for dinner is a very reasonable 9.50. The cashier was extremely friendly. Then we all sat down and then immediately started into the buffet. The selection was ok for me not great. I would have liked to of seen more of a selection especially vegetable dishes. Al in all I do have to say that the Golden Palace is defiantly worth the 9.50 for dinner. I would go again and I would recommend The Golden Palace Buffet to anyone who wants and inexpensive descent chines food dinner.",

Everything was okay and edible and I had a little bit of everything. Their selection is smaller than most but they have the big stuff: General Tso's chicken, chicken with broccoli, lo mein, etc. I did not like their hot and sour soup at all and the fruit looked a little off so I didn't have any of it.  Everything is self serve, which I did not mind at all. The lady working the register was super super super nice and she made me feel very welcome and was very friendly (which I think is very rare!). I probably would just opt for take out at a different restaurant next time because they're the same price comparatively, but if I was in the mood for a cheap buffet, for $8.50, this is not really the worst option available. It's a convenient location on campus and it's usually pretty quiet so yeah...",

    "text": "This is my first review since I moved to Pittsburgh a couple weeks ago. (Portland to Pittsburgh) So, of course I had to give my first to someplace worthy. My mom asked if I wanted to go eat at her favorite Chinese buffet.  I was a little skeptical at first, because we all know buffets could be hit or miss.  But when she said it was only $9.12 for dinner, I said why not, let's try it out. Upon entering we were warmly greeted.  You pay right when you walk in and pick any seats that are available.  And then, you DIG In.  They have a large selection of all the common American Chinese foods.  Lo mein, chicken + broccoli, egg drop soup etc.  My personal favorites (I have been there a couple times now, and get multiple plates) are the General tso's chicken, the garlic green beans, and the wonton soup, which is chicken based btw!  All flavorful and delicious.  But really the green beans are addicting- perfectly cooked, slightly crunchy and full of flavor. I could eat a whole plate of just green beans.  If something is running low and you want more, just ask. They make everything in house and are happy to stock you up.  Drinks are included. They have a soda fountain and hot tea.  The last time I went I had two big plates of food.  And because everyone is always skeptical of buffets.  No, I did not have any stomach issues after any of the times I went. All good!  The last time we went I was so full but the friendly lady who works there was like are you going to get dessert, I will make fresh donuts. I said I couldn't possibly eat anymore but low and behold she made a whole pan of fresh donuts for everyone who was eating. They were going quick, college kids left and right grabbing two at a time, so of course I changed my mind and grabbed one.  For sure worth it.  Fresh hot pipping donuts, definitely enough to fulfill a sweet tooth without being overly sweet.  So next time if she asks if I want donuts, the answer will be yes!!!  My mother and I vowed to now come here for some cheap eats a couple times a month.  We love it, and I hope you will too.",

They call them biscuits I call them yum There is something very comforting about this place from the gals working there ...coming from the kitchen wearing an apron and holding a pot of nice fresh food to add to the buffet. This food is fresh and homemade. Having grown up with a Grandma that lived just a few block from the real China Town of Manhattan this is the real deal ol fashion classic Chinese and now I am so hungry for their egg rolls I need to eat there again soon.

It's a good place for college students to pig out of greasy Chinese food.  There's a pretty limited selection for a buffet, so if you're looking for something specific this might not be the place for you.   I think there were just two people running the whole place.  One was cooking, the other was running the register, seating people and bussing tables after people left.  I actually see this as a good thing, sometimes it annoying being interrupted every few minutes by the waiter asking if you need anything, or refilling a drink.  I thought it was nice that they just leave everyone alone.  This was my first time there, but it sort of had a coffee shop feel in the sense that there were several people sitting alone studying.  It was also very quiet compared to other restaurants.",

The buffet food is pretty much the same as it was all this time, but it's still an okay deal considering the selection. I still think most of it is of questionable quality, stir-fried with lots of grease and sodium, but that's what you'd expect. The everyday items are nothing to write home about (General Tso, Hunan pork/chicken, beef broccoli, etc.), but they usually have a couple items that are more \"authentic\" and rotate daily. These vary from fried fish to soft scrambled eggs to Cantonese bbq pork or soy sauce chicken. Again, not the best you'll find anywhere, but decent considering the lack of Cantonese food in Pittsburgh.  We've also experimented ordering from the regular menu, with mixed results. Many of their items are surprisingly Cantonese and affordable. Things like wonton noodle soup (Chinese wonton, which is quite different from the Americanized version), beef brisket, and bbq meat noodle and rice plates are all offered. The wonton noodles were surprisingly good, with the skin quite thin and the stuffing very savory--might it even be homemade? The beef brisket noodles were mediocre at best; savory broth, but very tough meat. So there'll probably be more experimenting to do in future visits.",

    "text": "I can't believe I'm saying this - I actually really enjoyed the food here! I've talked a lot of smack on GPB over the years, but I have to admit, their buffet was legit. Sure, the selection was very small, but what they did have tasted great. This is the ONLY buffet in all of Pittsburgh that has tofu (and it's general tso's tofu! my favorite!). That was enough to impress me. The noodles was flavorful without being too greasy, and the fried rice was delicious (and it's not that weird neon yellow rice either). The buffet also features 2 vegetable sides - mixed veggies and green beans - so vegetarians have a good amount of items to select from. Everyone out there with a sweet tooth will be disappointed because their dessert selection is non-existent.   The service is the reason I'm knocking off a star. The lady was simply rude and not a single plate was cleared the entire time we were there. The buffet is set up so that it can be 100% self-service. You get your own silverware, your own food, and your own drinks. This is actually sort of nice because you get free soft drinks and you can refill whenever you want without awkwardly trying to flag down a waitress from across the room. My boyfriend and I usually like to dine without much disturbance, so we actually preferred being ignored by the staff.   Golden Palace really impressed me today! Great vegetarian selections, unbeatable price, mehh on the service, but overall, I had a very enjoyable meal!",

Mostly four tops but they had at least on large table for groups. There's a soda station in the back as well as hot tea included.",
