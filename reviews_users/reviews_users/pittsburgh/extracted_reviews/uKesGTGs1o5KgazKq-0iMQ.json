    "text": "In sum, I very much enjoy this place. Hence the 4 stars. I probably order out from here 3-4 times a month. It is my 2nd most favorite Pho in Pittsburgh. I don't stray from my favorites dishes below, so I can't speak beyond what I will post.   For an appetizer, I order the Crispy Shrimp Rolls. Oh my! What little pieces of crispy, shrimp heaven. They are smaller shrimps, but the price is affordable so I don't mind. In my opinion what really drives this dish to excellence is the Vietnamese dipping sauce (nuoc cham). From what I learned about nuoc cham, every Vietnamese family has their own twist on it. The ingredients in nuoc cham are generally the same, but the proportions vary based on personal tastes and regions in Vietnam. According to Vietnamese cookbook author, Andrea Nguyen, \"as you move south the sauce gets sweeter, hotter, and more garlicky.\" YUMMY!  I thoroughly enjoy the Pho Meatball entree. I LOVE fresh herbs and spices. Pho rice noddles served along side crunchy and light bean sprouts. Fresh cilantro and basil. I consider myself a Pho Meatball amateur connoisseur of sorts. I only order this dish, no matter where I eat Pho at. I like the way they slice the meatballs at this establishment unlike other places. It makes it easier to grab with the chopsticks =) Also they have less grisley pieces in this meatball Pho. I've never dissected them, but assume it is part tripe. The flavor is moderate with the slightest hint of kick. Also the lemongrass in the soup broth is so amazing. It is the epitome of Vietnamese comfort foods in my opinion. Coupled with the addition of Sriracha chile sauce and Hoisin sauce they include on the side is amazing.   The staff are polite and quick. One never waits long for your food. It is a little disappointing that they open for dinner so late. It would be nice to grab something right when I get off work versus waiting for 5pm to roll around. However, I cannot deny that it is most definitely worth the wait! Oh and like others have said, they are NOT OPEN on TUESDAYS. Odd, I know.  There are two things to be mindful of 1. If you are dining in- your portion size of Pho will be larger. This is not just at this Vietnamese place it is pretty much the norm for the other Vietnamese places around the PGH area. 2. Cash only. This last one is a major pain to me. I am not the cash and carry type of person.",

    "text": "I, straight up, love Pho Minh. This is one of those places that I would go to every day if I could. I love Vietnamese food, and have tried it in a fair number of cities. This was by far better than the best Vietnamese in Boston (Xinh Xinh) and a close second to the best Vietnamese in Seattle (Pho Bac).   I found Pho Minh, sort of on accident, my first trip to Pittsburgh. The owners were very kind and attentive. The food was delicious, fresh, everything was clean. The pho broth was the best I've ever had, delicately spiced and flavorful. They don't pre-cook the beef, which is excellent, so it doesn't become too chewy (it cooks in the broth). The second time we went to Pho Minh was the first night we got to Pittsburgh when we moved (this should tell you how excited we were). Coming from Boston, it didn't occur to us that it might be closing at 9pm. We got there at 9:15pm and they kindly asked if we wanted them to make us up some food to go. Even that was good.  We kept hearing, over and over again, that Tram's was freaking fantastic and we should go there instead. So we did. It was a mistake. I have no idea what everyone is talking about. The ambiance? What ambiance? It smelled like urine. Seriously.   Needless to say, Pho Minh for life.",

The staff is very friendly and eager to please. Pho Minh isn't fancy by any stretch, but it's cozy, inexpensive, and delicious.   I don't stray from the pho menu. I've tried the beef and also the pork with rice and egg noodles and they are all fantastic! Pho is all about the condiments and with your pho you get a good portion of fresh basil, lime wedges, and fresh sprouts. The tables are also decked out with soy sauce, fish sauce, red chili paste, sriracha, and a sweet teriyaki-type sauce.  I'm still a bit flabbergasted at the people walking in Tram's door instead of this one. Oh well, less crowds for me to deal with!",

    "text": "I absolutely LOVE noodle soups.  From cold winter nights to a late night snack in the summer, a big bowl of pho always hits the spot (as does ramen or beef noodle soup, but that'll be for other reviews).  Pho Minh serves up pho with debatably the most fragrant beef broth in Pittsburgh.  Their pho also always comes with sliced rare beef, which is sometimes cooked well done at other pho places (COUGH TRAM's KITCHEN COUGH).  Also, they do some of the \"unique\" parts such as tripe, which I am a fan of.  Service is reasonably fast, the atmosphere is reasonably dingy in a comforting homey way, and the food is tasty.  Yes, if I want some fresh spring rolls (Gi cun), I'll probably head to Tram's, but when I want pho, I want no nonsense pho, and Pho Minh is the place to be.  On a sidenote; their other dishes are pretty good too, but for me I'm heading to Pho Minh for their pho.",

The woman who takes your order is quick and abrupt, but she is very friendly once you get to know her. I love the little old man who seats you when you come in the door, and serves you tea. You have to ask for water if you want it. I love the tofu in lemongrass curry as an appetizer. The sauce is so good I wish I could put it on everything. I usually get pho with chicken or the special Spicy soup. The ingredients are always so fresh and just taste so healthy. The food is very flavorful and perfect after a weekend of riding my snowboard.

Small hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese place that from the outside doesn't look very impressive, but actually provides very good and cheap eats. Needless to say, their pho is quite impressive, and I enjoyed their lemongrass tofu appetizer as well. Their rice plate, at least the pork chop anyway, wasn't too impressive, so I'd probably say just stick with pho. It's pretty neat that they have more than just two or three options of each type of food--I think they do have a better selection than Tram's. Oh and their hot tea is very fragrant!",

I especially like the fried shrimp spring roll. The wrapping is crisp and light, and the filling is delicious. I'm not a fan of the fried pork spring roll though; the meat was dry and lacked any strong flavor. The restaurant itself is small and intimate; I like eating in because it's pretty quiet and the service is attentive and nice. I've also ordered pick-up a few times without any issues. Overall, I definitely recommend giving this place a try. FYI, it's cash only.",

    "text": "We traversed the Pittsburgh snowglobe post yoga for Pho. Generally Tram's has been the pho destination. I was curious to try another spot.  Restaurant is cash only. Smaller and less \"warm\" than Trams, but with the same familiar atmosphere. The menu is more extensive than Trams, and seems to have a greater variety of rice and vermicelli dishes.   The spring rolls were okay - gummy thick wrapper - the tofu was a bit too soft.   Green papaya salad with shrimp and nuts - refreshing however I personally resent when restaurants use frozen \"supermarket\" grade shrimp and charge premium. With several fish resources in the Strip I really expect better quality shrimp.  Pho was much lighter than what I have become accustomed to - and in contrast to another reviewer - I thought it was much less saltier than what I have had at Trams. The beef at Pho Minh was a better quality or cooked longer because I didnt experience the tendony gristle I sometimes find in the pho at the other place, It was soft and well flavored =).   I would come back here for Pho again or to try something else off the menu. I think they can improve on the quality of some of the ingredients, but I appreciate the much less filling, and less bloating Pho..",

    "text": "Pho Minh is this cool little family-run noodle shop that is great for both sit-down eating and take-out.  The food isn't the best I've ever had, but its quality is consistently good, particularly for PIttsburgh.  This place would probably still get three stars in a town with a larger Vietnamese populatrion, and in the Burgh it deserves four.  It usually has a mixed crowd of Vietnamese patrons and non-Vietnamese.  This is the place I used to regularly turn to on non-Tuesday nights (they're closed) in mid-Feburary.  Until about three years ago, the broth was a little erratic.  Some days, it was quite flavorful and others watery.  Then, the in-laws showed up (I'm assuming from Vietnam), and the consistency and quality of the soup broth shot up.  The pho is significantly more flavorful than nearby (and only) competitor Tram's, and the family that runs it is much friendlier.  Food highlights -     The pho is above average, particularly if you order it with beef raw (aka \"rare\") on the side.     The green papaya salad with dried beef (#12) is spicy and fabulous.     The fried spring rolls, both with shrimp and vegetarian, are excellent.     The shrimp and BBQ pork dish (#43) is one of my wife's favorites.  Food cons -     The chicken pho is a bit meh.    The fresh spring rolls tend to have wrappers that are a bit too gummy and thick.  All I end up tasting is the roll, rather than the basil-sprout-crunch inside.    They always have omitted hot pepper slices from their tray of pho fixings, something I tend to enjoy.  Notes - If you tend to like the raw beef in your pho, it's often kept in the freezer (for Dept. of Public Health concerns).  Then, it's often best to order the pho to go, heat it up to near-boiling on your stove, then serve it so that the broth is at a temperature high enough to cook it in your bowl, giving the broth a nice beefy cloud, as well.",

This place is comparable to Tram's, but being that I live in Houston which has plenty of amazing Vietnamese food to choose from and I end up always going back to Vietnam's Pho when I'm in Pittsburgh.   If I rank the places I've been to in Pittsburgh , it would be as follows starting from the best: Vietnam's Pho, Pho Van, Tan Lac Vien, Pho Minh, then Tram's Kitchen.   I know this isn't consistent with the Yelp reviews, but you can't go by the number of stars a place has all the time.

    "text": "Why did I ignore this place for so long?  I keep hearing off comments about this place.  \"It's ok.\"  \"It's decent but other places are better\" \"It's not as good as what you're use to (I'm from California)\" etc etc.  So I was never interested in coming here.  Today, I was working nearby and decided to stop in for the first time.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  I decided to give the pho dac biet and spring rolls a try.  I was happy to see a pot of jasmine tea waiting for me when I put down the menu.  Spring rolls were good and was satisfying.  The pho has a nice light broth.  I like light broth.  Didn't feel too overly heavy and I can I feel I can enjoy it perfectly without hoisin sauce.  Portions were great and huge. The beef was good, it had chicken in it which I thought was good, and I am happy to say they use the good meatballs.  Other pho places I go to don't use the correct meatballs.  I finished my entire bowl.    The place is small.  Restrooms are basically closets.  I get hit by the door every time I go into the restroom.  But hey, I found it to be clean.    The decor was nothing special and they had Vietnamese music playing in the background.   They have the recognizable chairs that you see in most Vietnamese restaurants.  Everything about this place reminded me of home back in San Diego.  I felt the food was good and satisfying.  The people there were nice, checked up on us, and they were conversating with other guests even with their broken English.  I thought that was cute.  Prices here are a tad cheaper than other places.  Cash Only probably has to do with that.   Overall, I found my experience here pleasant.  I liked the pho and I will definitely be back to give the other dishes a try.",

    "text": "Had dinner at Pho Minh again last night, after having had a wonderful time meeting some of the Pittsburgh Yelp gang and Rachel, our new local Yelp ambassador. I didn't say much about the food in my previous review, so thought I'd rectify that.   I'm a big fan of Vietnamese bun, which is a dish made with rice noodles and some kind of grilled meat, usually served in a big bowl with sprouts, cukes, scallions, peanuts, cilantro, lettuce and carrots. What I'm looking for when I order this is meat (I usually get chicken) that has been well marinated, as this lends alot of the flavor to this dish. Pho Minh marinates theirs in hoisin and maybe other things, and it's delicious. They add a little of this sauce to the noodles and garnish with the salad, then serve it with their wonderful fish sauce. This is a dish I crave. Their veggies are really fresh, the meat is succulent, and all of the flavors complement eachother so well. I like a deep fried spring roll with my bun, so I always order one, and they slice it and serve it right in the bowl. These are great here...really meaty little rolls. They use pork, and it's almost like a pork meatball filling. When you order these as an appetizer you get 2 of them and a side of their molasses/fish sauce combo. Doug had the Hu tieu xao, which is chicken, shrimp and veggies stir fried with rice noodles. This dish has some funky Vietnamese flavors, and has fish sauce as a base for the stir fry sauce, so you have to like that, but if you do, this dish rocks. Like all of their food, it was very well prepared and delicious. The woman who waits tables here always offers us their traditional mung bean pudding dessert, and we always say yes. This is a sweet and starchy treat served hot with a lacing of coconut milk. I love it. Tea comes to the table automatically and is free, and they offer some nice hot and iced beverages in addition. We didn't have the pho on this visit, but I will reiterate that it's great. I think this is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Pittsburgh.  This is a family owned and operated restaurant, so you will see the same friendly faces when you become a regular. Early on we learned to say hello/good afternoon in Vietnamese ( xin chao, pronounced shin chow) and we always get a big smile from the older gentleman who owns the place. Cash only, closed on Tuesdays.",

    "text": "I'll start with the \"bad\" stuff - the place is a small hole-in-the-wall, in an area that, at some times of day, may make you double-check that you locked your car. The restaurant is not the cleanest, nor is the menu the most extensive. HOWEVER...having traveled to Vietnam, and having been to a wide variety of Vietnamese restaurants around the US, this is certainly one of the most authentic. In fact, it reminds me of being in Vietnam. Are the spices on point? Yes! Delicious bowls of soup that should leave you with enough to bring home? Check! A couple cobwebs in the corner? Most definitely! An experience, to be sure. The place was about deserted on a Monday at lunch time, which was great for us - we got a window seat!  We started our meal with tea - this was your basic tea, nothing to write home about. We added on the spring roll with shrimp - and it was obviously freshly handmade to our order. Great appetizer to begin with - it's my barometer of a Vietnamese restaurant. This was a good one, not the best I've ever had, but quite tasty. I followed this up with a green papaya salad - heavy on the fish sauce (yum!) and covered in shrimp and peanuts. Very refreshing and light. My friend ordered the chicken curry with yam, which was creamy, freshly made (the veggies were not overcooked, as you find most places that premake lots of food) and not too spicy. I ordered the spicy vegetable soup with mushrooms. I'm not your average diner, and I like my spicy foods VERY spicy. This was maybe a 1-2/10. Pretty disappointing to me, but luckily the table was equipped with homemade Sriracha-like sauce and the ubiquitous chili-in-oil sauce found in cafes all over Vietnam. This solved the problem. The soup was fresh and filling. I will certainly be back again. There were tons of menu items I am dying to try!",

    "text": "I'm from socal. LA is pretty much my second home. I'm very familiar with all types of Asian food. This Viet place is actually not as bad as I thought it would be, considering it's in Pittsburgh.  I ordered #17 noodles in beef broth with rare steak and tripe $7.50.  It's not as loaded so the soup is a little more plain but it's good. I drank most of it and I don't feel like I'm going to have a heart attack. There's literally like no meat though. All together, the meat pieces if placed side by side on my hand MAYBE would have covered my palm ._. As for tripe, all the pieces laid in a line, were probably two finger lengths ._. It was sad how stingy they were. The bowl was barely 3/4 full and had a handful of noodles (I know because I took another order to go).  They give you the normal sides with the leaves, beans and one lime (forgot what it's called my bad). It's a decent portion I suppose.  They also give tea for free and it's pretty good.   Service: there's an older lady doesn't give good service. She just walks back and forth, not acknowledging anyone.  The entire hour that I was there, there were 3 other doubles and single customers.   Cleanliness: the table wasn't sticky. The condiments weren't either. Floor was clear. Chairs weren't too beat up. I didn't have a chance to check out the bathrooms.  Once I paid, she didn't give me the right amount back.. she gave me a dollar and some change less than owed. But I didn't say anything. So I just left a dollar less on the table as tip.   Basically: this place is very stingy with everything and nowhere near as good when compared to little Saigon IN LA and the usual place that I go to, in San Diego. But this is the first place I've tried in Pittsburgh and it's OK- it satisfies my cravings at least.   Remember: Cash only!",

    "text": "I love this place. This is the third Vietnamese places in Pittsburgh that I've tried and so far (Tan Lac Vien and Tram's Kitchen), I think this is the best one. I pretty much always get the vermicelli at Vietnamese places- here, I usually get their roasted pork vermicelli and the pork is great- nice and tender with a bit of chew, pretty much no \"weird\" bits of gristle to bite into. I do wish there was a bit more of that wonderful Vietnamese brightness from lime/mint/rice vinegar/etc, at least in the vermacelli.  Be sure to get the lemongrass tofu- I usually get it to share with others as an appetizer, but could easily eat two plates of it myself.    It's certainly not the fanciest place in Pittsburgh, but it is charming.  The owners are very polite and attentive and don't rush you out the door the second you're done. It's a BYOB, so a great place to have a no-frills lazy dinner with friends. I get the sense a lot of the people there are regulars and seem to know the owners pretty well. I wish they were open a bit later, but I suppose this is Pittsburgh after all.",

The amount of food you got for the price was awesome, the sauce on the side was delicious, and all of the flavors came together in a way that made the meal worthy of more than five stars. The waitress was sweet and helpful, the complementary hot tea was a nice touch, and the food left me feeling satisfied yet not overly full.

There were not many customers on Sunday during lunch so we were able to seat wherever we wanted. The waitress was really nice and friendly. They bring you hot tea before you order.  We ordered spring rolls, thai tea, bun boe hue and pho. Everything was okay, nothing extraordinary. However, I was amazed that the broth for the pho tasted that good!! I did enjoy the broth, however, there was barely any pieces of meat. The meat was cut too thick and small in which they were supposed to cut it long and thin so that the soup can cook it with the heat. I also did not see much tripe in my soup.   It's definitely a good place to get pho but don't expect much protein in your soup. I would definitely try it again next time that I'm craving for pho.",

SPRING ROLLS: Mostly filler noodles and lettuce.  1 shrimp, halved, in each, where most places give you 2 or 3 whole ones.  The 2 short strips of pork pate were gamey and unappetizing.  No Thai basil or mint included at all.  And the dipping sauce, usually like crack for me, was the most disappointing part.  Super artificial tasting, it was reminiscent neither of peanut butter nor hoisin.  A True mystery.  BO BUN HUE: I hate to say this, but this was probably the worst rendition of this dish I've ever had.  It came super spicy, the way I requested it, but had no flavor otherwise.  Not even seasoned with enough salt.  I have nothing else to say about this.  It made me sad.  I hate to write a negative review of a local, family-run restaurant, but the food here was simply not very good.  A very disappointing last meal in Pittsburgh. :(",

Clearly she doesn't know most credit cards cannot be used at an atm. So I then told her nevermind we'll be leaving now. Since I am Vietnamese i understood what she was saying and she knew I was too. As we left she shouted to her coworker \"nevermind don't make it, they don't have money\". This experience was very unpleasant and unprofessional of the business employees. I will not be returning nor recommending.",

    "text": "Okay real talk. I've been here now 3 times in the past two weeks and I'm hooked. This is probably one of my favorite places to get pho but I rarely venture all the way out there due to parking and the cash-only policy. It's not an excuse at all but that's my excuse. But whenever I do remember how much I love this place I then go overboard eating here. It's like I'm enchanted and I can't stop. I usually go for the pho with beef and tripe. The broth is delicious and the bowls are so big that I usually take some for lunch the next day. I like to order the appetizers of either the fried spring rolls with shrimp or the fried spring rolls with pork. Personally I like the fried spring rolls with shrimp the best but my partner likes the pork so sometimes I take one for the team and let him order what he likes. I know I'm just a good person like that. So I usually go with the pho which is amazing. There's usually a ton of tripe and beef so I don't feel like I'm just eating broth and noodles. The broth is so well done it's not salty at all which is my main concern with most broth-based items. I like that you get a cup and a kettle of tea when you get in there. Nothing says welcome like some fresh-brewed tea to sit while you're waiting for your spring rolls. The other day though I did try just some of their noodles instead of the pho. It just didn't hit me like the pho does. I'm going to keep with my favorite item on the menu and maybe venture out only if I'm really feeling it. That soup is too good to waste a trip up there and not get it. Maybe I should start thinking about ordering two meals just to be able to get my fix of Pho and to try other things. I can't wait for my next trip up there.",

Good quality, fresh, not too salty, economical. Always had good experiences.  Tea is provided with the meal. Service is super quick and thoughtful. Clean and simple decor and place. Gets full with locals around lunch/dinner hours.  The music is 70s? 80s? French-influenced Vietnamese music, same track every time I've been here. Don't touch that bead curtain!

Pho Minh was the second restaurant I tried and I was only slightly disappointed because they did not have tendon nor shrimp wrapped with sugar cane   But, the shrimp wrapped with beef was definitely a great substitute.  The broth was flavorful and I appreciate the large amount of jalapenos and basil, the last place I went gave us 4 leaves, no kidding.  Back to my pho, the rare beef was good; wish I had more and the tripe was chewy and plentiful.  Next time I'll order extra beef, I mean it's only $4.   The price, oh the price made the bowl that much sweeter. It's a comforting bowl of soup, it should range between 7-8.50, not 12-15 (without extras).  I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "We like to eat Pho on New Year's Eve so we found this place on Yelp and gave it a try.  Parking was easy because it was after 6 and street parking was free.  We walked in and it was three quarters full.  Not a huge place.  We saw a worker towards the back so we walked towards her and she just asked \"two\"?  We said yes and she sat us down at a 4 seater next to the wall.  She was the hostess/waitress and she waited on the whole room.  She wasn't too friendly. She wasn't mean but she wasn't real approachable.  We had to ask for water a few times and she only gave us one glass.  You really didn't want to ask her for anything eventually.  I don't know if that's just how she is or she had a problem with us but I think it was more how she was and it could be the norm here.  I don't know.   We started off with Fresh spring rolls with shrimp and pork in them.  We received two and it was good.  We both thought that it was poorly wrapped but I thought it tasted good to start out our meal.  I ordered the Pho ga (Chicken) and my wife got beef pho.     It didn't take too long for our food to come out.  We got a plate of basil, bean sprouts, and limes to put in our pho.  I didn't put anything in mine besides lime but my wife used most of it.  I thought the pho was really good.  The broth was tasty and I ate it all.  The chicken came in strips and I had no problem eating it.  The bowl wasn't as big as we have had pho in other restaurants but it was plenty.  We were really full afterwards    I thought overall the food was good so like a 6 or 7 out of 10.  We just didn't feel real welcomed and our waitress wasn't too helpful so it brought the experience down.",

The basil, bean-sprouts, and limes were very fresh and served on a separate  plate, so you could add as much or as little as you wanted.  I felt that the service needed some improvement, as the server seemed pretty curt with us, and she a little slow to bring us our check even after she saw that we were finished.  Otherwise, I thought it was A-OK.  Update: Several hours later, I started getting a headache, and I am not exactly sure of the cause, but one of my migraine triggers is MSG.  I woke up in the middle of the night with a full-blown migraine, so I cannot say for sure, but it might be that there was MSG in the pho.  Sadly, I didn't even think to ask when I ordered for no MSG, as I thought most places stopped using it these days.   Again, can't say for sure, but I would caution you to ask if you decide to go, and are allergic to MSG.",

    "text": "We came here on New Year's eve to have one of our favorite dishes pho.  Having never eaten here I was excited for what hailed to be a tasty meal per many reviewers.  The place was fairly busy but there were still tables available.  It's a small front, not very clean looking but sort of what I have come to expect in these old school establishments so it certainly wasn't turning me off.  No that didn't happen until later.  We were \"greeted\" by a lady who was a one man band.  By greeted I mean confirmed we were people of two and we indeed wanted to sit down.  We were pointed to a four top and given menus.  Our Hostess, server, and cashier was very curt.  This could be for many reasons.  Perhaps she was having a bad day, or was overwhelmed with the 34 full dining room, or flat out hates her job.  Maybe it was us.  I can't be certain, all I can say is I felt completely ignored and unwelcomed from the time we were seated until we left.   As usual when eating Asian we opted for some fresh summer rolls.  I also ordered the Pho Dac Biet.  I made sure to ask that I receive the traditional add ins of bean sprouts, lime, basil, mint, jalapeno ECT.   She brazenly took our order and I asked for 2 waters.  She didn't much acknowledge me and left to return with hot tea, which we noticed everyone had so it was complimentary.  Ok that's nice and all but I wanted water.  We wait a while and our summer rolls come out, and no water.  I said again can I please get two waters.  She again doesn't acknowledge me and returns with one lukewarm water with a lowly ice cube floating on top. She also slaps down one serving of Pho add in's though two Pho dishes were ordered.  I guess here they expect you to share everything?  To make matters worse the toppings were sitting in a small pool of water and were simply bean sprouts two wedges of lime, and some basil.  I was disappointed that it didn't include additional toppings that many other Vietnamese restaurants offer with their pho, but I also knew saying anything was of no use and could make matters worse.  Onto the food.  The rolls were poorly wrapped and lacked herbs for my taste though my husband was satisfied.  The peanut sauce was a joke and looked like an afterthought.  Full size peanuts floating on top of a thick overly sweet sauce.  For the pho.  It was a good ratio of noodles to broth which is appreciated.  I thought in the world of pho's this one ranked about middle of the pack.  The price wasn't bad but it really could have had a little more flavor.  The broth was somewhat bland and I added hoisin and sriracha from the overly sticky condiment containers left at the table to help it out.  It was doable, but mostly I just wanted to leave.  My husband always asks for a fork with his pho since he is chopstick challenged but with the less than stellar service he opted to struggle with the chops to avoid approaching the unapproachable server.  No sooner did we finish that she dropped the check off and said Happy New Year and walked away.  Most definitely the nicest and most scripted thing she said the whole visit.  Too bad the pho couldn't bring this review up a star or two.  Sadly it wasn't and there will be no repeat visit from us in the new year and years to come.",

The pork was dry as well, and the dried bean sprouts just made the overall taste seem very dry.   Cash only is another downside and the place isn't the most clean.

Also, I'm from Cleveland which has many great pho places in Chinatown. Due to this, I am extremely particular when it comes to Vietnamese and other Asian food. Pho Minh is the 2nd vietnamese restaurant in Pittsburgh that I've been to (The first one was Tram's Kitchen, and I honestly don't know why it has such good reviews because the food was so very bad when my family tried it. Maybe they were having an off day?)  Anyways, Pho Minh is the closest to my mom's high quality vietnamese food I'll probably get in the burgh. Prices are very affordable (most dishes are under $10) and portion sizes are generous.  So far, I've gotten the pho dac biet and bun bo hue. Both were great, but the pho was better in my opinion. Pho Minh is an authentic place, so I urge everyone to check them out! Lastly, they're cash only!",

The bowl was half full of chicken breast to \"fill\" it up. Noodle texture was gummy and broth was watery and bland. I wouldn't come here again. For better pho go to pho van - at 12$ a bowl it's overpriced (don't even get me started on two sisters) but will at least be more authentic.",

One of the few silver linings of Pittsburgh winters and cold weather is how well it pairs with the delicious pho at Pho Minh. Nestled on bustling Penn Ave, it's easy to walk right by and not notice its existence, but that would be a profound mistake on your part! I always get the Pho Minh soup (combo of rare beef, chicken, tripe, and meatballs) and add tons of bean sprouts, mint, and lime that comes on the side! Super filling and less than $10 - what more could you want?!",

    "text": "So I seem to have a strange handicap.  My first pho experience was at Lulu's Noodles in Oakland...  and it has set the bar.  Yeah, the noodles aren't quite right, and the broth is not quite right, either...  but...  the chicken is GREAT.  It's nice and tender.    Since then I had some pho in California and the broth is better...  the noodles are better...  but the chicken is weirdly dry and tough.  I don't know how chicken cooked in soup can be dry and tough, but it is.    In that respect...  the pho at Pho Minh seemed quite authentic.  Noodles were good, broth was good - but chicken dry and tough.  Why does Lulu's have the market cornered on tender chicken in their pho???    My son had the beef pho and the broth was SO much tastier than the chicken - the chicken was OK but it's the beef broth that is awesome.    My biggest problem was I thought the portions seemed kinda small, for what you paid.  I guess they are adequate, but not super-satiating, for a pho crazed adult.  My plan was to share mine with my two toddlers, we tend to be light eaters, and it was kind of tense.  I expect a bowl of pho to be giant, based on my CA experiences.  I guess if we go again, the girls are going to have to get their own bowl to split.    I guess it is a credit to this place that my two picky toddlers liked it so much!  Decent pho, portions kinda small, service REALLY slow.  (I think we were in there 1 1/2 hours!  For a family of 5, not a huge group)  Will probably go back, but we want to check out Tram's first.",

The broth is actually good, very light yet flavorful.  But the noodles are a disgrace.  They are lumpy, smooshy and not at all chewy...they just kind of dissolve once you put it in your mouth, and they take up none of the broth's flavor.  I also ordered some fresh shrimp spring rolls that were halfway falling apart when I got them, and barely any shrimp.  All in all, I'll come back if im desperate for Pho on a Monday, but otherwise...nay",

Pho broth takes like nine hours to make.  The broth at Pho Minh is bland and almost clear in color.  Good broth should be dark and pungent, not like watered down chicken broth.  I had the combination beef with tripe pho, and there was literally about five small pieces of beef in there.  I guess since there is not much competition here for Vietnamese food, the $8 price tag is valid, even though that's much more than what I normally pay for good pho elsewhere.  We also ordered the deep fried spring rolls, and that was a disappointment too.  Mine was also still cold in the center, so I can only guess that they are frozen beforehand.",

Both times , the food was perfect. We started with the spring rolls, served cold with a nutty fish sauce - deelish. We then ordered the rice pancakes, which were loaded with shrimp and tofu. Lettuce cilantro and basil on the side, all fresh and graciously served. I tried spicy beef over lemongrass. The spice and citrus were a perfect combination. The portions are plentiful and all the entrees were priced under 9$. Highly recommended. One tip-they only take cash. Love this place and hope to add it to the regular rotation of Pgh dining!",

Family is usually present and it's nice to see the kids hang out and help in the restaurant from time to time.    Meal starts with free tea served as you are seated. Food is slow to some out but they make it to order and it is a small staff so it's to be expected. It is definitely not a place to go if you need to get in and get out fast. This is a sit down and chat kind of place.   This is another of my \" I'm sick and need a spicy soup\" strongholds. I suggest the vermicelli soup. I used to stop in here just to buy a few fresh rolls and know I am among several others who do this.  Pho Minh won't blow you away it's just a good place to get some Vietnamese food and meet with friends- which is reason enough for me to return.",

Normally I just order a bowl of pho because I know it'll come out quickly but since I was starving today I decided to try out one of their pork+shrimp spring rolls too. In hindsight, that was a bad choice. Although they were supposed to be cold, it had a tingle of the ingredients inside being undercooked and the pork was actually just the same type of ham you would find in a salad bar. It wasn't what I expected.  I got the #19 (beef and tripe pho) and my friend got the #20 beef balls and it came out smelling pretty nicely and in an extra large bowl. The traditional uncooked bean curd and basil leaves accommodated it but as I started to eat more and more of it, I feel that the taste began to taste marginally...blander. Regardless, for $7.50 for the #19 and $7.25 for the #20, it was a pretty good value and I personally prefer this over its rival down the street, Tram's kitchen.  Just remember that this place is CASH ONLY",

I spent a semester in Vietnam eating Pho on an almost-daily basis, and now it is my comfort food, what I want when I am sick, tired, or sad. That said, I can recommend the Pho Tai without hesitation. Out of the 3 Vietnamese restaurants I have been to in Pittsburgh (this, Vietnam's Pho, and My Ngoc), this has the best pho. The broth is quite good; fragrant and savory.  I both eaten in here and gotten take-out. Eating in is a pleasant experience. The dining room is tiny but spotless and bright, and the free pots of tea are a nice touch. The take-out pho is packaged very thoroughly and intelligently. In a plastic tub goes the broth, beef and onions. The noodles are packaged separately in a little plastic bag so they don't get soggy before you have a chance to eat. All the fixings, including copious amounts of basil and bean sprouts, are there, including little tubs of hoisin and chili sauce. Delicious, authentic pho prepared by a friendly family. The only downside is the cash-only, which is a huge PITA.",

    "text": "Craving for some more authentic Vietnamese pho. Yelped and found this place in Pittsburgh. Drive 80 miles from Morgantown, WV and found the pho is good. when I first walked in, I was a little bit skepical because everyone else was white! Lesson I learned before was that this could be a sign that this restaurant would be tailoring to american taste. But since I drove 80 miles already I decided to give it a try. the menu was pretty small comparing to mecca of Asian food (Southern California). Ordered the Pho dac bet. When the pho came out, i thought it would be like the Southern California size as the bowl was decent size. But the pho and soup were sitting at the bottom of the bowl, about 1/3 full. I was a bit disappointed. I loaded up my bean sprouts into the hot soup and did a quick stir to cook the raw thinly slice steak. The pho was actually pretty decent. The soup was flavorful and the pho was well cooked. Just wish the amount of pho and the ingredients could be more. I ended up having a roast beef sandwich at Nadine's afterward.",

It's not the classiest joint by quite a stretch, but it took me back to sitting in Pho restaurants or street vendors in Saigon.  Man, I bet I ate at least four bowls of the stuff a day.  Take that for what you will, and I'm sure it's not for everybody.  For those peeps, there is a PF Changs at the Waterfront for you.  There are a few other Vietnamese places that I've tried and really enjoyed, but this place will always be close to my heart.",
