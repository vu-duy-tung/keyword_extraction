    "text": "Pros: -Fast delivery within Squirrel Hill -Moderate prices -Fairly diverse menu (does not have regular omissions typical to Squirrel Hill Pizza shops) -Several healthier options available on menu -Discounts and coupons galore -Online ordering is quick and easy Cons: -Drinks forgotten on order (very common for delivery orders) -Pizza is alright but not \"good' -Hoagies/subs are pretty bad (cheap bread, very little cheese & rubberized meat) -Deserts come frozen with the wax paper included -Fries very tasty but pretty soggy as well. -Foreign delivery driver may have difficulty with delivery instructions. While this is still a new establishment, given the amount of direct competition in the immediate area I would have expected better. The delivery time for my order was truly excellent but in their haste they disregarded my drink order. The Driver did return however within several minutes after being chased down, but the drink he returned with was still a variation on my drink order. I would say that the quality of the food is OK, not incredibly good but certainly not the worse pizza in town. Also, their personal pizza options and late night delivery option make it an attractive choice for delivery. On my order the desert arrived mostly frozen and still wrapped in it's original freezer wax paper. Also the fries were placed in Styrofoam which makes them soggy. There are 3 types of Pizza Shops in Squirrel Hill: -Specialty (Mineo's, Aiello's, Napoli's, Lucci's) -Big Chain (Vocelli, Domino's, Pizza Hut) -Budget (Amier, Rialto, Italian Village, Bellino) Pizza Bellino definitely belongs to the later category. For me, when judging a Squirrel Hill budget pizza shop, I always use Pizza Amier as a comparison standard (since their prices are the lowest in the neighborhood). Are they more or less expensive then Pizza Amier? Does their product taste better than Amier? Does the taste justify the cost? While they do offer a tasty product and some more diverse menu options than Amier, I do not feel that the taste justifies the cost in this instance. I would not recommend this Pizza Shop. However, if had no other option I wouldn't consider it out of the question either.",

Their specialty pizza's aren't so great and aren't worth the price.  The problem I have with this place is the drivers (one specifically) who found it necessary to comment while checking out my girlfriend.  I don't care for any sexist pigs to deliver my pizza, so you can be sure I'll never order from this place again.  Lucci's has just as good of prices with just as good of pizza and faster delivery time.  Mineo's is still the best in the area.  Just based on principle, you should avoid this place.  Unless you like being oogled and have sexist remarks made to you when you're trying to simply order a pizza.",

    "text": "For our first pizza since moving to Pittsburgh, we wanted something simple and inexpensive.  We'll try the Aiello's and Mineo's later I'm sure, but we were just looking for something standard to curb the pizza craving.  Found a coupon in the mail for a $15.99 combo at Pizza Bellino - a large pizza and 12 wings.  Sold.  I called to place the order, and whoever answered the phone was a bit disorganized.  When he asked to put me \"on hold,\" he clearly just put the receiver down on the counter because I could still hear him yelling at someone and then taking an order from an in-person customer.  I felt like a moron because I kept thinking he was talking to me!  Also, after I ordered, he did not take my name or any personal information.  I know it was pick-up, not delivery, but um - shouldn't you get my name?  I tried to ask if he wanted my name but he'd already hung up.  Stellar first impression!  Not.  (haha. I said \"Not.\"  I'm eight years old.)  SO we mosey down the street 20 minutes later for our pizza.  Seeing as he didn't have my name, the dude tried to give me a pepperoni pizza with wings, and then we had a brief and confusing verbal exchange where I said I didn't order pepperoni, but I'd take it if they made it by mistake - as long as I didn't have to pay more than the coupon price.  The guy did not seem keen on that idea, but then suddenly he had an epiphany - perhaps there was another pizza in the back - the one I'd actually ordered!  Revelation!  And that was what happened.  At home, we opened up our boxes, ready to chow down.  The pizza was utterly, totally \"fine.\"  It was okay.  It was standard.  It was pizza.  Cheese wasn't oozingly melty, there wasn't a luscious smear of homemade sauce, and the crust didn't have those hand-tossed bumps and crevices.  It was college student pizza.  Totally standard, totally satisfying.  The wings were actually a step above - lots of meat on them, and the sauce was pretty hot!  Lips and tongue definitely tingling for the rest of the evening.  And of course, cheap (with a coupon at least!)  I'd get pizza here again - especially if I was ordering for a crowd or a sporting event and didn't want any really gourmet or expensive pizza.  It's probably good drunk pizza too.  The wings I'd definitely order again as well.  It's totally fine pizza, as long as you know what you're getting into.  If you want something above average, look elsewhere.  If you just want crust, cheese, and sauce - this will satisfy your cravings.",

    "text": "This is the best pizza in Squirrel Hill, IMO. Good crust, quality ingredients, nice sauce (not too much, not too thick, not too sweet), well spiced. It is not quite New York style, but it is a thin crust pizza. I particularly like the Bellino Pie - which also has a good amount of smoky bacon on it. Another wonderful pizza, if you like white pizza, is the Mediterranean pie. It has feta, black olives, artichokes, tomatoes - with a nice light grilled, fresh and flavorful taste. If you don't care for the super cheesy Mineo's, and want something more flavorful than Aiello's, Pizza Bellino's is the place to go in Squirrel Hill. Very good, fresh salads, as well, and I would also recommend trying their specialty pastas",

Pizza Bellino was a surprise for us.  It's new and right by the library, neither of us had ever been inside before.  Turns out, it's got some of the best overall pizza in squirrel hill!  While it didn't especially stand out in any one area, everything about it was good and nothing about it was weak, Good sauce, cheese, pepperoni, cheap, fast, and they put extra cheese on top of the pepperoni which no other pizzeria did.  Nice touch, and very tasty slice overall!",

It came with a ton of spring mix greens (a la Costco), a handful of fried chicken bits, a bunch of soggy fries (Pittsburgh style, I guess) and a giganto glob of fried cheese on top.  The cheese was so all encompassing that I had to basically remove it and throw it out.  The fries were good but a little too greasy.  Not much else to the salad besides a couple of tomatoes and peppers.  A pretty unsatisfying salad but guess that's what I get for ordering salad from a pizza place!",

    "text": "I'm surprised by the reviews for here because I've never had a problem with them. As Duchess you probably can guess I'm here a lot and much more than the times I'd remembered to check in. First of all, you have to give them some credit for being the newest pizza joint in a area that already has 6 others. I mean really at that point you know they're either naive or they can offer something better.  So all the reviews from what I can tell are about their pizza. Well they  also have good wraps, awesome calzones, crisp cheese sticks (not soggy like eatnparks) and huge delicious salads! They have a pizza special 2 cheese slices and a drink for $4 which I dare you to compare to Italian Village Pizza just up the street where they have the same deal but thin cardboard pizza slices. If you go for one of Bellino's specialty pizzas, go ahead an compare it to Lucci's which is overpriced \"gourmet\" pizza that doesn't deliver. When it comes to Mineo's pizza and Aiello's pizza, you've got to know they have been around so long that they have a rivalry between the two, you like one or the other, but it's also completely unfair fight if you try to compare it to Bellino.  The have a clean area with tables to dine in if you choose and the food is served to you quickly. I've only had it slightly burnt once when I went in on a Friday night which is was obvious they were swamped with orders and deliveries to be done. Also when it comes to the phone service, it's always one guy helping you and the customers at the counter. They don't have fancy hold music, he asks you to hold then helps the customer there and then helps you as quickly as he can and in the order you came. He's the same guy there every day except Sunday working his hardest. It's obvious the difference of the pizza on Sundays is lower quality because he's the one that keeps the employees on their toes. I'm giving them 5 stars because for what they offer I think they deserve it. In Pittsburgh, pizza isn't just the same everywhere, you have to pick your pizza place depending on what you want out of it, remember that!!",

    "text": "New Years Day and this was the only pizza spot in Squirrel Hill open late. I decided to take a chance on this place... The service was horrible. Then to add insult to injury the pizza was beyond unappetizing. The toppings were dry and over cooked  on the Bellino Pie not to mention the fact that there was barely any cheese or sauce.... Just dry over cooked toppings. We also ordered the chef Bellino pie.... It clearly stated white garlic sauce... There was no sauce at all. Actually, there was dry basil and Plopped Ricotta cheese carelessly placed on this pie. When we tried to call the restaurant to return this $42 monstrosity of an order, they were disgustingly rude and had no intention of making this right. When you pay $42 dollars for 2 lack luster disgusting pies.... A review this size is warranted. If I could give negative 5 stars I would!!!!!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I am a New Yorker (before Pittsburgh, I lived in Manhattan for 8 years and Long Island before that), and we can be very picky about our pizza. The dough should be thin enough where it's crunchy, but not so thin that when you pick up the pizza, it flaps down. The sauce should be just a bit acidic, but no so much that it tastes like vinegar. And the cheese should be plentiful enough to give pizza that characteristic flavor, but not so plentiful that you get a glob of fat in your mouth.  Well, after trying a whole host of pizza joints in the 'burgh, I'm happy to say that Pizza Bellino is my favorite. Now, this isn't going to be authentic NY pizza, but it will pretty close. Every time I crave a slice, this is the first place that comes to mind. In fact, but for their $11 minimum order for delivery, I would have some on the way right now!   If you want a classic pizza without any frills, Pizza Belino will do the job.  (and stay away from those terrible \"Pittsburgh Pizzas\" at Aiello's and Mineo's ...bleh)",

Delivery is always made within a reasonable amount of time, and pizza's consistently delicious. Not too expensive either.   Also ordered gyros and spaghetti w/ meatballs from Bellino's before. HUGE portions!! and tasty too!   Next time you crave some pizza, skip Domino's or Vocelli's check out Bellino's. It may surprise you!",

There's a good balance between the crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings, with none of them being overwhelming and all of them having the same high quality. It's been a consistently great pizza over the years, and none of the other pizza joints we've tried around here have been able to better it. The pick-up service is good and it's a nice little place without many frills. Highly recommended if you like a well-balanced pizza with a good mix of toppings.",

In my opinion it is over priced and some of the food tasted 'out of a box' not freshly made. My wife ordered a small pizza and it left much to be desired. It tasted more like cardboard than pizza. My sons chicken tenders where okay. I mean how can you ruin chicken tenders. The cheese sticks went fast. My boyZ collapsed on them. So that's a good sign. While the service was okay, and the establishment clean , there just seemed to be something missing. The tables had no condiments, salt pepper etcetera.  No napkins and or silverware. Finally they do not offer fountain drinks. We (a family of four) were forced to by one two liter soda as opposed to each person getting what they wanted to drink with dinner. To sum this up, I like to vote with my money and my feet. So my feet will not be taking me back to Bellino, and my money will not be spent there. Understand that I like trying new experiences, and I am not against spending money. I just expect to get what I pay for. Good luck Bellino, you may need it.",

SUCKED! BAD!  Small personal pizza- omg... it's beyond my vocabulary to describe... simply sucked. My food rarely goes into the trash but this time, it did.  Baked Ziti- again, basically the same tomato sauce and cheese as the pizza. Result in, SUCKED!  French fries- not the type I liked. Skinned and mush. I prefer crispy ones.

Keep in mind this is a very casual pizza place - you order at the counter.  We had five adults and six kids so they would have had a nice order. There was only one couple in the restaurant, seated by the window. They did not seem to mind that there were families in what should have been a family restaurant.  However, when we went to order, and our kids were seated but yes, being kids excited to be with friends, they were laughing and having fun, the owner told us that our kids could not disturb the customers (again two people who were not looking over and likely had the impression that kids were welcome). We were stunned. Kids were not obnoxious (which bugs me even w/ my own kids but whatever if you're at a very casual place). So we left and went to Jimmy Johns and owner lost $100 of business for very silly reason.",

Pizza Bellino is one of the closer pizza places to my apartment, but I just made it here recently.  I stopped in because I was starving, and they sell single slices for $2.  I got a great slice of cheese pizza!  One slice was enough for a small meal, and the sauce is very nicely spiced.  The cheese quality is good too.  The service is pretty fast when you eat in, unlike Aiello's and Mineo's.  I have always had good customer service here as well.  There are crazy good lunch specials, and they always have deals in the Squirrel Hill Pennysaver.  As one of the only places that delivers in Squirrel Hill, I can imagine it can be pretty slow and tense.  I would stick to eat-in.  Good for a quick slice of pizza!",

The chicken tasted like the shrimp, so they clearly use the same oil (ew). The cheesesteaks were nothing more than the steak-ums you buy at the grocery store. No flavor, very little cheese and browning lettuce. The pizza is subpar at best; and with Mineo's and Aiello's just up the road you'd think they'd want to at least try and compete. It's a cheap knock off of a real pizza place. I know the other two don't deliver, and maybe that's what keeps this place afloat (or the drunks who order delivery because they can't drive and therefor can't taste the food either), but I'd rather drive and attempt to find parking on Murray Ave before I ever give this place another dollar. I'd give zero stars if I could...",

While hungry on this particular lunchtime, my coworkers and I decided to try something a little different than what they usually get (thank heavens for that).  After riffling through the menus they had stashed at work, they came upon Bellino's menu.  After looking it over, and tired from pizza and hoagies, I decided to go with a salad.  Not a bad choice to make.    Unlike your typical pizza place salad, this one actually made me feel full.  Maybe it was because of instead of using iceberg lettuce, they went with the mixed greens as the base.  And unlike other pizza places, they actually gave you some good toppings.  cucumbers, green peppers, grape tomatoes, and carrots.  I would have been satisfied if I would have just gotten a regular salad with those toppings.  However I did opt for the popcorn chicken salad which basically voided my healthy eating for the day.  With all the good for you toppings, they added the popcorn chicken, a ton of cheese and french fries (hey, they are still a vegetable ;)).  Overall, I liked it.  It hit the spot and I wasn't craving anything by the end of my shift at work.  I would definitely give Pizza Bellino a spot in my folder for their menu.",

I really don't get these bad reviews...this has been me and my workplaces fav for a while now...just stick with any of the pizzas (the broccoli one isn't amazing...get bbq chicken if u want specialty!) and gyros!!

When it never came, I called the restaurant just to see how much longer it would be until the driver arrived. The guy who answered the phone (I'm assuming the manager) immediately started yelling at me and telling me it was my fault. When I tried to tell him I wasn't mad he was late, I just wanted to know how much longer it would be, he began berating me and telling me that I need to learn how to answer a phone. I tried to tell him I had my phone on me and that I had been sitting outside but he wouldn't even let me get three words out. He was screaming so loudly that I couldn't even understand half of what he was saying. He then said \"he'll get there when he gets there\" and hung up.  When the pizza finally arrived (I was honestly surprised that it did) it was horrible. It was cold and tasted like it had been sitting outside for hours. Plus, it was very rubbery and hard to chew.   PS just a shoutout to GrubHub.. I called about the issue and they're taking care of it.",

I thought they did a good job with their crust.  I'd prefer a bit more crust myself, but the rest of the group liked it.  The Italian hoagie was nicely balanced between meat, cheese, and bread and toasted nicely.  It was a vinegar and oil based Italian dressing, not the creamy Italian that some places use for some reason.",

Some of the supposed \"better\" pizza places in the area we live are not open on Sunday afternoons leaving us few options either A) for delivery or B) just to eat!    We got wings and a chicken parm hoagie... both were good, but nothing spectacular or over the top.  They get brownie points for being fast and efficient though.  The food was actually fresh and hot when it got here... the hoagie was not soggy like they can often be when too much time elapses before it gets to you.  I would definitely order from here again... good basics with good service in a timely fashion makes it worth trying.",

The best thing about Bellino is they have amazing crust and breads. A personal pan pizza is cheap and very filling. They don't do anything particular with their sauce or cheese, so it stays mild and consistent. But their crust is always amazing! Their breadsticks are always amazing!! They make their own dough, and it shows. The breadsticks are puffed perfectly, and chewy, covered with parm and garlic sauce. People usually get really excited about olive garden breadsticks, but I am here to say that these are 10 times better.   They have a vast menu, and the owner is always there. I do sometimes wish they would switch out their flourescent bulbs in the dining area. But definitely give Pizza Bellino a try, I think it will happily surprise you!",

To start, when approaching the cash register the employee did not say hello or even what would you like. It was literally a staring session for a few seconds with no dialogue when he approached the register.     I broke the ice and this is how the convo went.  Me: I would like two Pepperoni slices please Him: With drink? Me: No thank you Him: *Sticks hand out for my credit card* Me: Well what's the total? Him: with no drink, $5.

The slices get topped with toppings and then into the oven so they come out really crispy and delish!  The staff is always nice and very welcoming and the location is great. There are very few good delivery options in squirrel hill besides Chinese/Asian so I call Pizza Bellino when I don't want to go out.  The delivery is super super quick and always shows up piping hot.

I placed my order online and, while browsing the menu, I saw an option for a white pizza with spinach, ricotta, tomato, and mushrooms OR a traditional white pizza (with no ingredients or description listed.)  I thought perhaps the traditional white pizza came with spinach and ricotta (as some white pizzas at other restaurants do) but I was disappointed to find that it was just a regular cheese pizza sans sauce.  I expressed my disappointment to the man working and he was unhelpful- he merely informed me that i had ordered incorrectly and didn't offer any solutions, so i left with my pizza.  It was pretty bland and greasy but it was ok.. I mean, even bad pizza is still good.. right??",

My friend ordered food from them through grubhub wile we were hanging out - popcorn chicken and buffalo fries- but upon arrival,  my friend received chicken tenders instead. No big deal, but the hot food came in Styrofoam containers, and because they were stacked, the packed heat melted the containers into/onto the food. They tried a bite of the chicken and it tasted distinctly like Styrofoam. They proceeded to be violently ill for the rest of the evening. When i came back after class, we tried calling,  but the man who answered was HORRENDOUS. We politely asked for a full refund of the food we didn't eat,and were told that we had not ordered from them at all. We had to repeat ourselves several times to establish the fact that yes, we did order this food, we had the order in front of us.  He then said that the containers don't melt. Well, this picture of the container I have says otherwise.  He continously interrupted us over the phone, berated us for yelling at him (which we didn't do, we simply asked for a refund and stated why), and when he was fed up told us that it was grubhub's problem instead and refused to accept any responsibility. Honestly, if he would have just been polite and directed us to grub hub in the first place,  this wouldn't be an issue,  but because of his behavior,  we will no longer be ordering from this establishment again. On top of that, it would probably even be cheaper and more environmentally friendly if they'd just  switched to cardboard containers. Not to mention, no one would get sick.  Tldr; melted Styrofoam made my friend sick, worst customer service we've had in years.",

I told him that I ordered through Eat Street and the soup I ordered was an option on the menu. He then said that both Eat Street and I are \"stupid idiots\" and me getting the wrong soup is my and Eat Streets fault and I got what I'm getting that's it. I asked him why he was treating a customer so rudely and he cussed at me. I then asked him if I couldn't have the potato soup then why was it on the receipt and why would they just automatically send me wedding soup? And why is it my job to call them if they don't have the soup I ordered, why wouldn't they call me and ask? He screamed at me that am a spoiled, worthless American and should ___ __! He then hung up on me. I called Eat Street and told them what happened and they were so appalled that they refunded my money and sent me a coupon for my next order through Eat Street. Thank goodness Eat Street knows how to treat their customers. I only called this man to get the correct soup, if he just said \"We're sorry, we don't have it.\" this would have all been over and I would've been fine but he was so terribly ignorant and rude to me, that they lost a very good cutomer today and possibly lost their membership to Eat Street. Do yourself a favor and don't ever order from here, it turned my great day into a headache.",
