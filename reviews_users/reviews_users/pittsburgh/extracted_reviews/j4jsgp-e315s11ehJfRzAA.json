    "text": "After reading the numerous positive reviews and being a short walk from the hotel I canceled a reservation at another restaurant and the family headed on over. The clientele  was a bit eclectic...mostly older establishment types, but intermixed with everything from young bachelorette party-goers to aging Saturday Night Fever aficionados. The mixed clientele was a harbinger of the meals to come with  tantalizing appetizers and desserts, but major disappointments with the main courses.  When the appetizers arrived, we knew we made the right call. The briny muscles with loads of garlic, tomatoes, capers, olives in a savory wine sauce were divine. The lobster gnocchi was loaded with crab and lobster...very rich and satisfying. The Caprese salad was made with the freshest tomatoes and mozzarella...all top shelf.    Then the dinners arrived...a Mahi-Mahi filet served over Spanish rice look disheveled on the plate. The mahi-mahi was grilled adequately, but the Spanish rice tasted like something my mother made from a box. Overly spicy and completely obliterating the fish. Next were the recommended scallops. They looked like they had been sitting under the lights for hours. They appeared pallid on the plate...just sitting their lifeless surrounding a pile of wilting greens. Finally the chicken dish was simply bland...inadequately seasoned and completely forgettable.   We needed something to cleanse our palates from the dinner, so took a chance on dessert and were pleasantly surprised. The rich and hot chocolate chip cookie covered with creamy vanilla ice cream were a hit.   It's hard to figure how a place that does appetizers so well could completely miss on its main courses...not one, but all of them. Maybe the kitchen just had an off night, but for a restaurant in this price range the batting average needs to be a lot higher. My recommendation is to stick to the appetizers and a nice glass of wine.",

Pleasantly surprised that it was over 75% full on a cold Saturday evening (730 reservation) with a varied clientele:  I honestly expected to be among the youngest  there..  Our server, Anthony, was cordial, informed and did a great job.  Great wine list...okay cocktail (bourbon Manhattan).  Total bill was lower than expected, with 3 glasses of wine & a cocktail.  The Carlton salad was great:  we both had one.  She had scallops (very good) and I had the barramundi (excellent).  Hot fudge brownie sundae for desert, which was on the house since it was my wife's birthday.  Great experience....would recommend it......good for special occasions.",

You have reservations, you show up and the hostess walks you to a table that is maybe 15 inches wide sitting awkwardly in a walkway.   Guess it's not going to be relaxing. Whatever...I can get past it, although it's my number one pet peeve. OH! and number 2: chairs so high and tables so low I can't fit my hand in between the table and my leg. I'm not Kareem Abdul Jabbar, this shouldn't happen....it did here too.   I pick up my napkin and to large pieces of old lettuce fall out of it!! The waiter goes...oops, let me get those out of your way.  No offer for a new napkin. We decided to get just an appetizer bc we couldn't face pittsburgh traffic without something in our stomach. We ordered a meatball. It was dry and forgetful. At this point my problem is with yelp for not offering a zero star option.",

The tuna was good with an interesting take on it with an Asian tea broth and my wife's mahi-mahi special was spiced just right. Her mule drink had some kick and my bellini was nice and sweet. They validate parking, whisk you to the theater in a complimentary limo or private car (make sure you tip!) that gets you in your seat before the show starts (even if you leave at five minutes before like we did). Not to mention the drinks are nice and firm-to-strong and the menu has something for everyone's taste. All-around good time.",

She usually gets this appetizer as her entree but tonight we shared it.  We each started with the Carlton salad.  A staple.  Nice amount and very tasty. I got the pork chop special with chorizo sausage, cheddar whipped potatoes and asparagus wrapped in filo.  Everything was excellent!  My wife got the sea scallops which were ok, but I definitely out ordered her tonight.    With a few drinks our bill was about $100.  Very inexpensive for this quality of restaurant.   Plus, they are in the entertainment book or, in the case of this evening, we were sent a $25 gift certificate for my wife's birthday.  Love this place.  Very old school.  Good strong drinks, great service, and excellent food.  One minor complaint.....what's up with the elevator musak?",

The food and wait staff are always top notched.  What is unusual, is that there doesn't seem to be much turnover in staff, especially the hostess, that is atypical in the restaurant industry. I had used a discount card which was inadvertently left on the table.  I received a call  first thing on the following business day from the owner advising they had it and would send it to me, which I received the following day.  My only disappointment is that they don't regularly have one of their old but delicious seafood specialties on the menu. They will, however, always make it if requested at the time our reservations are made.  That, is EXCEPTIONAL customer service!!!",

And when we said we were too full for dessert, he offered a half portion banana cream pie... \"on me\". I know, it sounds like something you'd order in a diner, but believe me, it was really stellar. One of the best desserts I've ever had.  Bobbie even got us a cab to our next destination. This is how it's done, folks!",

    "text": "Legendary Pittsburgh restaurant/nightspot, past its prime.  Interior was last updated during the era of Drakkar Noir and mousse, is now threadbare and chintzy, in a style that a few years from now will be considered edgy, cool and retro.  Restaurant itself is located in the upper lobby of a glass and steel building housing Mellon Bank and the local offices of Jones Day; would've been a hot prom date destination for a rich kid in a John Hughes movie. Service is inattentive and lackadaisical. I ordered a glass of wine that was tantalizingly described as 'unknown' on the menu. Wine by the glass is frequently a burn, since you never know how long ago the bottle was opened, but at a place which boasts of its carefully curated wine list, it's an enticing dare. Unfortunately, it turned out to be limp and shy, something which my waiter should've warned me off of. Plate came out hot, meaning my order had been sitting around as forgotten as my meal is now.  A chicken something, nothing memorable.  It's too bad, because this place obviously has an interesting past and still has genuine character, and the staff all seem to have been around a while.  It seems like a place you could warm to (and vice versa) if you lived in town and were a regular, and if you're just visiting it's definitely worth a look if you're into local history, or a serious cosplaying late 80s fetishist. But if you're not any of those things, you'll probably be happier eating elsewhere.",

I had the sea bass bites for the entree, however, I feel that the honey mustard sauce somewhat over powered the sea bass. Service was spotty as well. Desert was microwaved bread budding.

Chef Simon has an incredible talent for blending flavors, making every bite a welcoming surprise. His Laughing Bird Blue Tilapia is a meal experience you cannot pass up.  If you are concerned about eating fish because of all the factory farming taking place, you can rest assured you are getting a clean fish when you eat Laughing Bird Blue Tilapia. It is never treated with hormones, bleach, antibiotics or chemicals. This is fish as nature intended.   The first, and most obvious, part of the meal is the fresh tilapia fillet. This fresh meat is not farmed in the traditional sense, and the taste reflects that fact. The meat is firm, juicy, and bursting with sweet fish flavor without the muddy after taste that occurs in earth pond raised fish.  The fish by itself would be a suitable meal, but Chef Simon brings it to the next level with these additions.

    "text": "My husband and I were so overly disappointed in our experience on New Years Eve at The Carlton that I will never return or recommend this restaurant to anyone.  While this was my first time dining here, my husband had gone in the past and very excited to take me for a special dinner on NYE.  He, and others, had such great things to say about past experiences that I was very excited to give it a shot - even though I had read some of the mediocre reviews before going.  We made our 8 PM reservation for NYE on December 8th.  When we booked through an online site, it appeared as though we had secured one of the few remaining reservations.  We showed up right on time and were told to go sit in the bar by the hostess.  I looked at her confused and she told me that they were running about 30 minutes behind and hopefully would catch up.  Being that it was New Years Eve, we understood and found a seat at the bar for a before dinner drink.  The only good part of our experience at the restaurant was with the gentleman who was tending bar.  He was friendly and responsive allowing us to get served quickly.  After about 40 minutes and into our 2nd drink, my husband and I started to get curious about when we would ever get seated so he checked in with the hostess.  When he came back and was telling me that there were still 2 parties ahead of us, the couple next to us started up a conversation with us about the long wait.  This is when we came to find out the other couple had just made their reservations on the 30th.  We couldn't believe how over booked they were.  After a few minutes, the couple who booked at the last minute were seen to their table and my husband and I sat around until almost 9 PM waiting for our table.  The bartender tried to make it up to us by comping a glass of wine for me and offering my husband a fresh pour on his scotch.  The hostess walked us to our table - and right past the coat check - without allowing us to stop and check our coats.  Mind you, most people were able to check them as they arrived but we were not given this offer.  The hostess finally offered to check them for us once we carried them all the way to our table.  At this point, it's nearly an hour after the time of our reservation and we sat at the table for well over 5 minutes before our waiter stopped by to simply say hi.  We had no menus, no water, no offer to get a drink - NADA!  After waiting another 5 minutes and watching our waiter clean off tables, put on linens, etc. I stopped a passing hostess to ask for menus.  The waiter overheard and made it seem like we were being impatient but finally brought them to us.  Keep in mind - it's now 9:10 and our reservation was for 8 PM.  He said, \"Oh you are in luck, usually at this time of night we don't have everything on the menu but tonight we do.\"  Disgusted with the experience thus far, my husband and I opted to skip appetizers to save time as it was NYE and we did have plans after dinner.  We ordered the surf and turf ($37) and a 14 oz. prime rib ($36).  This was certainly the straw that broke the camels back.  About 20 minutes later, we were presented with 2 underwhelming and barely lukewarm dishes.  On the surf and turf, I had a very petite lobster tail (maybe 4-6 oz) and the meat was cooked in a way that most of it stuck to the shell.  The turf part of the meal was the ends that typically get cut off of a prime rib and discarded.  The Carlton called them prime rib caps - wish I would have inquired on that one!  I have 2 \"puffs\" of some type of whipped potato that were cold to the touch and a few small pieces of limpy asparagus.  My husbands 14 oz prime rib was 8 ox at best and was served with a small lump of mashed potato that you could tell were cold by looking at them.  He also mentioned that it was so salty he could barely eat it.  Starving, we began to eat.  Torn on sending the food back and possibly waiting another 30+ minutes for something else or just sucking it up and eating what we could stomach of our plates, we opted to just suck it up.  The manager stopped by at one point to ask us about our food and we were honest in what was wrong with it.  The problem was, he wanted to know what else he could do for us and we honestly didn't want to be there any longer or have to eat any more of the food.  A bit later our waiter returned to clear our plates and set a dessert menu out in front of us saying the manager would comp us anything we wanted for dessert.  My husband and I looked at each other in disgust and declined the offer.  This is the real kicker - at this point, the waiter, who we never saw while eating, started to put the blame on us for not liking our food.  He said we should have spoken up to him - we were very clear with the manager, so there was obviously a barrier in what was relayed back.  After waiting yet another 10 minutes for our bill, the waiter brought it back and gave us 50% off and to be honest - we should have only paid for the bottle of wine we got!",

    "text": "In fine dining, there is a line between good service and overbearing. Our evening at the Carlton was more than overbearing. The waiter kept referring to us as his \"friends\" (maybe some people like this but we found it weird as they were doing us a service and this would not happen in a professional setting), they talked about the menu for a solid 7 minutes and we had someone checking on us every 2 minutes, we couldn't have a conversation as we were constantly interrupted. Our food and all silverware were cleared before we could even object that we were not finished and it was extremely overpriced for the food we received. While tasty and high quality, there were three dinners (no additional sides) and two drinks that came close to $200 after tip and the service was hawk-like and creepy. We do not plan on returning.",

    "text": "I've read many reviews for this restaurant and, frankly, the mixed bag has kept me from trying this long time Burgh institution.  We decided to give it a try and made reservations through open table.  We entered and were quickly and pleasantly greeted by the hostess who sat us promptly.  The waiter Bobby presented us with menus, a cocktail menu and the wine list.  First, the wine list is extensive and fantastic; in fact it's one of the best wine lists I have ever come across in a fine dining restaurant.  We ordered a wonderful bottle of Malbec and the presentation by our waiter was first class.  I started with the seafood chowder, in a word, out-freakin-standing!!  Excellent flavor, delicate yet full of flavor.  I ordered the bronzino (Mediterranean Sea bass) it arrived, beautifully presented.  The fish was cooked perfectly, the skin was crispy and the fish was light and flaky.  It was sauteed with lemon, capers and butter and served with whipped potatoes, sauteed French beans and micro herbs.  I'm not sure I could have had a better seafood experience if the ocean was right in front of the place.  This truly was a great meal, I enjoyed every bite.  I am so disappointed we waited so long to try this place.  Based on the meal, service, wine list and dessert I would never, ever hesitate to recommend this place to anyone.  I hope you enjoy as much as I did.  Kudos to The Carlton and its staff...TOP NOTCH!!  Just a side note $167.00 for meal, dessert and wine for 2.",

The place is huge with plenty of seating although the seats are pretty packed together.  They have a very extensive wine list and you can get 3 different size glasses of wine. I went with beer and ordered the Full Pint White Lightening.  The bread they brought out was pretty basic and I went with the tossed salad to start with minus the mushrooms and dressing on the side.  I wasn't the biggest fan of the dressing which was like some sort of thousand island.  My date went with the crab cake-it was an extremely small portion but he enjoyed it.  For my entree I went with the steak filet and you had your pick of a few sauces and toppings. I went with a blue cheese crumble with steak sauce. The steak was cooked just to my liking and came with a veggie assortment ( I asked for just carrots) and whipped potatoes. All very delicious although the steak was priced at Morton's or Hyde Park prices but did not compare in quality. Also it is just an extra on the menu not sure why a pricey steak would be hidden on the menu. For dessert we went with the Tollhouse cookie with vanilla ice cream which was scrumptious.  Our waitress was great and made the dining experience exceptional.",

Coming from Florida my expectations in regards to seafood is quite high. Two of us had the crab lobster gnocchi and the other had the halibut. All of which were huge portions. There was no skimping on the buttery lobster which by the way was cooked to perfection. Oh and if you have a taste for cocktails they are heavy on the poor so the Carlton is worth every penny spent. If I every return to this area I will be sure to come back. Thank you Russell for taking care of me and making sure I had extra juice as I struggled through trying my first gimlet.

    "text": "Five of us had dinner at The Carlton last night and it was a wonderful dining experience.   For appetizers we had: 1 jumbo lump crab cake, 1 beet salad, 1 lobster and crab gnocchi, and 2 house salads. The Jumbo Lump Crab Cake which I ordered, was meaty with crab and was very rich sitting atop of Julianne vegetables. The Dijon Cream and fresh herb sauce it came with was just delicious. The gnocchi was tender and mild which allowed the lobster and crab to predominate the flavor profile. It was served in a Spinach, Caramelized Onions and Tomato-Ketel One Cream base. Very tasty indeed. Salad eaters, house and beet, all said they were great as well. These were all very good size appetizers so you might save some for taking home if you plan on heavy entrees and tend to fill-up fast.  With the appetizers we also finished off two lemon cream martinis, one sour apple martini and one Grey Goose on the rocks with a twist, and one Arnold Palmer (AP refills aplenty). All drinks were made well. The had a nice martini list, a pretty good wine by the glass list and a full wine list which comes out on an iPad. Pretty cool approach. I am not counting but they say they have over 500 wines on the list. Enough to match any taste or meal. Later for dinner we wanted some rich, creamy full mouth Chardonnay so the proprietor suggested Sonoma-Cutrer for us. This was delicious and great match with our food.  Dinner entrees were hard to choose from the extensive menu which includes some great daily specials which they say usually change every day. Sticking with a theme, I went the seafood route all night and choose the Florida Grouper which was prepared oven roasted and was fresh Parmesan crusted and served with Lobster Pierogies, Spring Vegetables and Roast Garlic Butter. Oh my was this meal ever rich and tender. The Grouper was completely melt in your mouth fresh and tender, and I exaggerate not one bit. The Pierogies were moist, tender and full of lobster stuffing and it went so well with the Grouper. Boy this was a satisfying choice.   Three people, were enticed by the 14 oz. medium to medium rare Prime Rib. They all came out looking absolutely beautiful. Jody who is the real Prime Rib  connoisseur said that his ranked up with the best of them. Jody has traveled and lived or visited may cities for extended stays.  He has lived in Las Vegas so he had the opportunity to eat a Lawry's Prime Rib several times. To which I can say when I ate there with him a time or two, and I thought it was the best I ever had. So that puts The Carlton up with the best prime rib places in our judgment. Linda went for the Ahi Tuna entree, which she said was extremely fresh and tender with the fabulous Tuna flavor one seeks in the best sushi. But it doesn't come naked. It's preparation is fresh Wasabi-Panko crusted with the Ahi Tuna seared rare and served with Curry-Coconut Orzo, Asian Greens, Hearts of Palm-Julienne Carrots and Yuzu Butter. This was a beautiful and tasteful preparation. Had enough to bring home and it served as a special breakfast this morning.  I have to say that everything was really outstanding at The Carlton. Topping it off with some personal service, Kevin Joyce, the owner stopped at our table to see if we were enjoying or meals.  Have to hand it to Kevin, his professional staff, and especially Executive Chef Mark Swomley who has been there for 16 years. The Carlton itself has been around for 27 years which I think is a real testament to its enduring quality and service. You can not go wrong here.",

I came during restaurant week with a group which was a perfect opportunity for me to try multiple things here.  I honestly don't remember what the entree I ordered tasted like, but my crab salad appetizer was a great start to the meal. Pleasantly, the crab to salad ratio was higher on the crab end. It was dressed with a vinaigrette giving the whole salad a very crisp and fresh flavor.  The best part of the meal was the dessert. That probably made me forget what the entree tasted like. Since I came with a group I was able to try their Chocolate Mousse Tart and Capuccunio Torte. Both were rich, chocolaty, and addicting. The Torte also came with this delicious oreo-cookie like crust.   One plus for this restaurant is you can get your parking garage ticket waived. Free parking in Pittsburgh is a win.",

    "text": "I first came to Pittsburgh nearly three years ago and was taken here.  I consider myself a food snob and did not expect to be impressed by any restaurant in Pittsburgh, but I was.  I was in Pittsburgh again this past weekend and had a chance to visit The Carlton.  It did not disappoint and is the best dining I have found thus far in Pittsburgh.   For apps this past weekend, we ordered the portabella mushroom, gnocchi, and stuffed meatball.  I can't decide whether I preferred the mushroom or gnocchi, which is surprising since the portabella mushroom app wasn't even on my radar, but was so pleasant and light in its flavors.  The stuffed meatball was tasty, but disappointing to the extent that I couldn't detect any cheese.    For entrees, we ordered the duck ragu (WOW), the bolognese (the ragu was way better), one of the fish, and the wellington.  All were delicious, but the duck ragu was such a star and so surprising in its combination of flavors.  The duck was cooked perfectly!    For dessert, we shared some chocolate cake that I thought was lackluster, but I also wasn't  hungry and we were 3 bottles of wine in.    The Carlton is on the list of definite recommends and staples for when I'm visiting the Burgh.",

    "text": "Highlight of the meal was dessert.  Cappuccino Torte was outstanding.  Tollhouse sunday was also very good.  Prime rib and filet were good but it's pretty hard to screw those up.  House salad was bland.  Nothing special.  All romaine lettuce with some tomato, bacon bits, shredded hard boiled egg, and a slice of mushroom.  It wasn't warm or wilted but not exactly cold and crisp either.  A restaurant in this price range should always serve a salad on a chilled plate and have mixed greens IMO.  The crab cakes were awful.  There was some jumbo lump in there but a ton of filler and it was breaded and deep fried.  Deep fried, pan fried, or pan sauteed are the preferred methods of cooking a crab cake but don't bread it.    The worst part was that I actually pulled out a large piece of snow crab meat.  Yes, they mixed in snow crab meat with the jumbo lump and didn't even bother to chop it up.  I also encountered a piece of red shell from the snow crab.  I've had a lot of bad crab cakes in my time but at least they've always been lump or backfin.  The service was good.  Server was pleasant and friendly.  Attentive but didn't hover and didn't rush the courses.  A little slow on refills.",

I had the veal and it was out of this world.  One of the best pieces of meat that I've ever had.  I seriously enjoyed every bite of it.  My girlfriend had the Mahi Mahi and didn't enjoy it as much as I enjoyed my dinner.  The fish must have got done before my veal since it came out at a less than desirable temperature.  I tried the fish and thought that it had good taste but it wasn't as warm as you would expect.  It was also sitting in a mushy bowl of something that I'm still not sure what it was.    Service was very good and even the owner came to the table at one point to make sure that everything was OK.  We will come back but will not get the Mahi Mahi.",

What's great is how versatile the place is if you want an excellent meal.  Power lunch?  Check.  Lunch with friends?  Check.  Celebration dinner? Check?  Casual dinner before a hockey game?  Check.  The menu is constantly changing,  but the concentration is on fresh seafood and meats, elegantly prepared and oresented.  The serving staff is among the top I have seen - attentive but not intrusive, honest in their assessments, friendly but not cloying.     The Carlton is consistently among the top restaurants in Pittsburgh for a reason.  You will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "Despite working next door in the US Steel tower for three years, I had no idea The Carlton was located in BNY Mellon until just this past week when I was taken there for a work holiday lunch. I think that with all of the trendy new restaurants and buzz in the cultural district, these \"old school\" places sometimes get overlooked.  I found the experience to be pleasant overall. Everything about this place is traditional, from the very classic decor and coat check at the entrance, to the perfectly set table with white linens.   Even though it was a safe choice, I was in the mood for chicken parmesan. It was on par with the chicken parm I've had at other places; it's hard dish to mess up, after all. What drew me in was the fact that it was served over mushroom risotto instead of the usual spaghetti. The risotto was very flavorful and cooked perfectly. I really enjoyed this pairing and will probably copy the idea at home. The dish was accompanied by a side of green beans.  I had the creme brulee for dessert and was not disappointed. The hard, caramelized top was uniform and the custard underneath was silky and delicious. My coworkers tried some of the cake options and had nothing but good things to say.  It's old-fashioned, but not in a bad way. Definitely a good option for a business lunch downtown, and I can imagine it's a great spot for dinner on a special occasion as well.",

    "text": "I had high expectations based upon reviews and location of the restaurant, but was also hoping the mediocre reviews would be wrong.  I don't think this place knows what it's doing.  There is a strange air of refined elegance that's not backed up by the food whatsoever.  The service was fine, and we were there for an early dinner on a Friday night.  The restaurant was empty, but our server kept telling us that he would be back shortly with the evening's specials.  Then it all made sense.  They insert the specials into their menus directly.. but then he continued to go over each one, pretty much reading the description verbatim.  I found that to be awkward.  Husband and I started out with the lobster and crab gnocchi.  It had plenty of seafood, but the gnocchi was overcooked and the sauce was too heavy and creamy for the dish.  It lacked salt and seasoning.   We were both in the mood for red meat, so we ended up ordering the NY Strip & Lamb Chops.  The NY Strip is typically topped with blue cheese, but my husband asked for it to be done without. The steak came without the blue cheese - and without any seasoning.  It was one of the blandest steaks we'd ever had, comparable to a steak cooked on the flat top at an Outback Steakhouse.  The steak had no grill marks and came with over-blanched and unseasoned asparagus and very buttery red mashed potatoes. The potatoes should not be the star of the dish.  This is not a $40 dish.  And you can't depend on blue cheese for flavor.  My 3 lamb chops were big, and I asked for the herb butter sauce to come on the side.  Again, no seasoning and no grill marks.  More bland asparagus, and more buttery mashed potatoes.  This is also not a $40 dish.  Huge portions don't make up for the poor quality.  We didn't look at the dessert menu.  At that point, we had a clear idea of what it would be like.  The restaurant advertises itself as an expert in fine dining.  This was a JOKE.  I could also be pretty mean and biased, as this type of fine dining compares to nothing like the fine dining I've had in Philly.  Thoroughly and disappointingly disappointed.   I should have just went to the Spaghetti Warehouse.",

Our waiter was attentive but it always seemed like he was flustered and in a hurry even though the restaurant was half full.   We started out with the salmon ravioli and chicken bruschetta. Both were decent but nothing incredible. For our entree my husband got the filet and I got the grouper. His filet was delicious, perfectly cooked. My grouper was a bit bland but went well with the tomato asparagus accompaniment. We both had the bread pudding for dessert and weren't impressed-definitely not your New Orleans bread pudding!   Overall, we had a nice night and didn't leave feeling overly full like you can in other restaurants. We were both satisfied but not blown away to the point where we feel like we have to go back.",

I had specifically asked for a  booth when I made the reservations. we got 1 of those compact booths made for 2 small people, but at least we couldn't smell the bathrooms! our waiter moved with lightning speed, unfortunately he never did much while he whizzed around. when he did surface, we had to have our answers ready for his questions, pronto, but barely gave us a chance to ask our questions. he was upset because we asked for a wine list-whizz he was gone. like every other time we went for restaurant week, we ended up ordering off the menu! I don't why, but we always do! so we ordered the calamari for an app. it was perfectly cooked, but there was a pile of tomato sauce on top of it. we had to pull the calamari out so it stayed crunchy. maybe put the sauce on the side next time guys! we went with the regular menu because they had prime rib, only thing better than a beautiful piece of filet! we love the tasty rub of herbs on the outside of the prime rib. it came, not as rare as possible as we had asked for. it was a dull lifeless gray with NO herbs for flavor at all! it cut perfectly, it was tender, just no taste. typical splat of gluey mashed potatoes & veg on the side. we decided to not have dessert for so many reasons! but, it took us, it seemed, forever to wrangle the waiter for the check. LET US OUT OF HERE!!! we ate there once before & liked the place. we expected the same this time. boy, were we wrong! maybe if they weren't so busy.....",

    "text": "Note #1: Make a reservation. Do not drop in unplanned.   Note #2: The dress code is somewhere between dressy and casual. We saw enough people wearing jeans to confirm this. Just use your best judgement.   Note #3: Their online menu deviates somewhat from the actual in-house menu and changes regularly.   My memoir of Friday night's masterpiece of a meal is as good a review as any to serve as #900.   Kay's mother was celebrating her 50th birthday, so Kay and her chef brother, who was visiting from New York, decided to grant her the ultimate treat: Dinner at The Carlton.  The 6:30PM reservation meant a change of clothes at work and much deodorant and cologne as I simply had no time to head home and shower. As it turns out, my worries were unfounded; I was one of the more formally dressed people there.   The interiors were as elegant as one would expect for such a high-end urban restaurant. A wall full of wine bottles could be seen catacorner from where I sat. White tablecloths dressed dark, brown, wooden, olden tables and chairs. Fay, our accomplished server, handed the 6 of us (Kay, myself, her parents, her brother, and his girlfriend) menus, opened properly, and read aloud the specials in a professional manner. It all felt ceremonial, as if something grand and unforgettable was about to occur, and of course a spectacle of gastronomy ensued.  I was privileged enough to be allowed to choose an appetizer since my dining companions had trouble deciding, so I placed my finger randomly on the Braised Short Ribs. Smothered in a sort of blue cheese risotto that had the consistency of cottage cheese, the pork withered exquisitely in the mouth, taking on the penicillum's pungency. Dried tomatoes puncuated the proceedings with a sweet/tart blend that shocked my palate into full alertness.    The Original Carlton House Salad came next for me. On a bed of Romaine lettuce laid tomatoes, mushrooms, bacon bits, and hard boiled egg pieces. The affair's \"Louie\" dressing came off as a criminally smooth and flavorsome Thousand Island, making it the apex of Cobb salads. And that's what you get a The Carlton: The apex of tradition. Illustrating this further were the baked potatoes I caught sight of being served to other guests and thus coveted. Each one had a lattice fin of fried potato as a garnish, causing them to look as ornately monstrous as dread Fafnir...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.marvunapp.com%2FAppendix5%2Ffafnir_nastrond.htm&s=27fb7653bfb5f7dfbfc2c357eccbb37d9bd9849c025f81f8e4feaec74d364975\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">marvunapp.com/Appendix5/...</a>  Ordering the main course was a challenging decision. Kay went with a pasta dish that celebrated seafood as well as housemade strands of al dente dough. Fortunately, I needed to finish it for her, so I can testify to its saltwater majesty. RJ also gave me a bit of his Lamb Gnocchi, which offered the most for one's money being that it was the least expensive and most generously portioned dish on the menu that night. Its grilled, mildly cauterized chunks of protein crashed gently into the pillowy dumplings like the Dave Matthews song, begging to be eaten together in singular bites, all of it wallowing in a mysterious sauce.   Eventually, I chose a fish I've never before eaten in The Grouper. From  the shores of tropical Florida came a creature with flesh as light in mouthfeel as a poached egg but coated with a Parmesan crust to give it punch and crunch and butter of roasted garlic to make it as wealthy in fat as an oversized scallop. A medley of stringy vegetables became a buttery, makeshift linguini, and hiding underneath it all were pierogies stuffed with nothing less than lobster.   Dinner had been such a ride, we could have ended it all then and there with no regrets, but...there was a dessert menu...  Fay brought out twin Tollhouse Cookie Sundaes for Kay's parents, and of course, when they could not finish, the rest of us banded together. The dance between chill and warmth, salt and sugar, crisp and cream is why this type of sundae is a perennial favorite of mine, and Carlton's may have the definitive version on their (his?) hands.   A tornado of more confections followed, each of us sampling and moving on to the next. The Coconut Cream Pie with its toasted, nutty embellishments, was again another zenith put forth by The Carlton. A Raspberry Creamsicle Cake added a touch of childhood whimsy to our finale, its buttercream filling being the cake's centerpoint. To extinguish all such innocence came...the Chocolate Grand Marnier cake...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DG3IUt83-DTo&s=5b47414735368d44b31c4d663f857440b0b5f684225397e5a6f29711e86c3654\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=G3IU...</a>  Darker and more destructive than a black hole, the layers of richness from crust to mousse-ish packing threatened to consume us all with Hellborne perversions of a cocoa nature. Lurid, murky, deathfully mighty, it towered over the plate like a castle of confectionery doom, but our collective will and righteousness rendered it to rubble in the end.   And with that, a classic feast had ended. That's fine dining, kids.",

    "text": "We decided to take advantage of the Bonus Days of Pittsburgh Restaurant Week and booked a reservation at the Carlton.  We had high hopes, but we're severely let down by the food, service, and whole experience.    Perhaps we were \"too young\" to dine in there.  Like a kid sitting at the adult table, we were essentially ignored by the waitstaff and, when ordering from the Restaurant Week menu, I felt like we were written off right there.  We had to request silverware from our server and received either badly tarnished or dirty spoons... so much that we had to ask for new ones.  Also my husband didn't receive a napkin and had to ask for one as well.   The almond chicken salad arrived and it looked pretty.  The tomatoes were fresh and colorful.  The chicken had zero seasoning and the salad had way too much dressing.  It was supposed to have cheese, but it was missing from my plate.  I simply couldn't eat this salad.  I picked at it and attempted to salvage a few bites, but it was not enjoyable.  Hubs ordered the seafood cioppino.  I found it to be salty tomato soup... it wasn't something to write home about.  My entree was the bronzino and it left me baffled. Why on earth would you put the crispy skin of the bronzino in a broth?  It becomes completely saturated and uncrispy.  It needed to be seasoned and the red cabbage and mushrooms were just drenched in a sweet and sour broth which was... just not good.    Hubs enjoyed the pork chop.  The barbecue sauce made the chop, but again it just wasn't that great.  Finally dessert - the waiter forgot that we ordered dessert and handed hubs the menu.  We reminded him that we already placed our orders and he seemed confused before he went back to the kitchen and put in a rush order for our desserts.    My husband ordered the raspberry cheesecake and he didn't save me a bite... I'll take that as a \"I liked it.\"  I ordered the banana bread pudding.  I strongly believe someone mixed up the salt and sugar when making the caramel sauce.  I mean it was SALTY. The ice cream was tasty and the banana bread pudding was just okay.  The caramel sauce ruined it for me.  I would like to give kudos to the bus boy.  He was the only prompt and attentive employee we encountered.  Would I return?  I don't think so.  I see other reviews and feel like we went to a completely different restaurant.  Our experience was just poor and I wouldn't recommend it.",

The food was good, properly cooked as the menu described; service was ok, but very slow(they weren't busy at all). water refill was super slow, get it after we were out of water for a while. Had to ask for drink refill too. Over all it was a good experience but there are definitely some improvement can be made for their service.",

We also ordered bread, and we had to ask for it a second time. The bread finally came out after 35 minutes. The waiter also forgot to bring our side dish of asparagus, so we had to ask for it again. The waiter mostly looked at and spoke to my husband, although the reservation was in my name. We repeatedly overheard the manager yell at the hostess from across the restaurant. Because it was my birthday, the restaurant gave me a free chocolate chip cookie with ice cream, and it tasted very good.",

After waiting another 15 min the sliders were returned with the bread burned and the lamb was still undercooked! She mentioned to the waiter that it looked like the whole slider bun and all had been thrown in the broiler he replied with a curt 'no'.  A manager then came over and offered her another entree but by this time we had already waited more than 50 minutes for our orders.  They did not charge her for the meal...but they were also not very apologetic about the bad service and food.   We will not be returning. This is not the first time in the past few years that the food has not been up to par.  The menu has changed and not for the better. The Carlton was our go to place for a good lunch but after today's experience.......not anymore.",

I was headed to a show and someone made a reservation and  The Carlton did not disappoint at all.   I love my dinner so much it was gone before I remember to take a picture.  I ordered the short ribs with whipped potatoes and broccoli.  It was an amazing comfort food dish that took me back to my mothers cooking.  On a cold winters evening it was the perfect dish.  To end the evening I had the creme brulee and well. How can that not be amazing.   I will definitely return!",

We stopped in for the Restaurant Week lunch, which was generously priced for a restaurant of this caliber (similar to The Capital Grille). We made a reservation, although it seemed like it was unnecessary. Service was pretty standard from checking in all through our meal. We started with a crab bisque for the first course, which was very tasty and contained surprisingly many pieces of seafood. It went well with the bread as well.  The main course was an amazingly tender and flavorful piece of prime rib cap, along with some asparagus, tomato, and buttered rice. The prime rib was unbelievably tender---it came apart easily and also had great texture. And it was done perfectly (I got medium rare). The sides were fine, though the rice was probably a bit too rich. The desserts were standard options of a bread pudding or a chocolate espresso cake, both of which were quite good.   Great move by The Carlton to offer this option for Restaurant Week!",

I've been here many times over the past few years and have been impressed with each meal and each overall experience. Their menu changes often, but they have a few standard menu items that have stuck.   A few of my favorite apps include the Calamari (not usually a fan but they prepare it VERY well so it is not super chewy) and the Lobster & Crab Gnocchi. As far as the entrees, you can't go wrong with a steak here. I've done this multiple times...I typically go with the filet- medium rare, and it's always cooked to perfection. Other favorites of mine include the Duck Pasta or Scallops.   When I was here recently, our server was Russell and he was absolutely wonderful. Friendly, funny, attentive and truly enhanced our meal overall. He made some great wine recommendations as well!  If you are planning a night out downtown or just want to treat yourself, I highly recommend The Carlton!",

The place was overbooked with big holiday party tables and Pens fans. Our server was overwhelmed. I begged several times for a wine list but never actually got one. Remember, this is supposed to be a wine-focused restaurant. It was a disappointing but understandable circumstance. We'll go back, even for Pens pregame dinners, because the parking situation is about as good as it gets - free (with the purchase of a dinner, that is) and close.",

Pretty much everything was great, from the greeting, to the seating, to the service, to the timeliness of our apps and entrees (we were going to a concert and needed to not linger). Kudos to the kitchen, the Branzino special was cooked perfectly, nice crispy skin, tender delicious fish, all the garnish was delicious. His veal chop was  gorgeous, well-prepared, and very tasty. No time for dessert, but coffee was dynamite, as good as the coffee at the Duquesne Club, and that's not easy to do. The busboy was kind enough to check with the kitchen to see what herbs were in the delicious butter that came with the bread plate. I am not a huge fan of the dark wood decor and I think it could use an update, but with quality food and a great staff this is a solid 4.5 star restaurant! The Carlton has been a class act in Pittsburgh for a LONG time, many other places have come and gone and it is still drawing crowds. Kudos!",

    "text": "Unlike some of the reviewers that debated going to the Carlton due to mixed reviews, we had been there a few times before and had very good experiences. The other couple in our party however had not been there before so we were excited to see how they enjoyed the restaurant. The other members in our party arrived earlier than our reservation time and were seated promptly. They had a glass of wine and asked for a menu to order an appetizer while waiting for us. The server left the menu and when we arrived at the reservation time,15 minutes later, the server had not returned to take their appetizer order. We were approached about drinks and I ordered wine and my husband ordered a soda. Of course I received the wine but  he never brought the soda so we had to ask again.   We were rushed into placing our dinner order and I can never remember in my life, especially in a restaurant of this caliber, not being asked about appetizer, soup salad etc to go with meal. He basically asked about our entree and went on his way. I'm sure we could have pushed the point but I think we were all looking at each other like \" what just happened?\" Other tables had baskets of bread which we did not receive. When the entrees arrived, only three came out and at this point my brother in law left the table and went to see the manager. What upscale restaurant would allow that?  So we all stared at our food getting cold while waiting for the final entree to arrive. The manager apologized, offering free dessert which at this point none of us were interested in. We just wanted to finish our food and leave.  Our issues were definitely service related. Food was average. Filet cooked as requested. Branzino was good. The risotto on which is sat was like paste. I did not eat that nor the tasteless side veggies. Sea bass was good, 4 green beans on the side. Really? Prime rib looked ok. Cooked appropriately.  Price of entrees was reasonable. We ended up getting out of there and went to another restaurant for drinks and appetizers as the men in our party were still hungry when we left.  Sad part is this used to be a favorite restaurant of ours, we liked  the old school feel of the restaurant. Our Initial plan was to go to Hyde Park but due to steeler game no valet available there and didn't want the parking hassle so we opted for the Carlton. Will not come back and will go to Eddie Merlot,  Hyde Park or Ruths Chris in the future where service is exemplary.",

The service is a total stand out. Our waiter was very skilled in making recommendations, handling the table, and keeping our lunch moving along perfectly, as it was a business affair. He handled everything from prompting orders to delivering the check and taking payment with perfect tact.   I was also so pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. The bread and seasoned butter was FANTASTIC. I had some type of cheesy sourdough. If it wasn't a business meeting I probably would have had three slices.   I had the southwest salad. Wow! It was a huge portion and everything was so fresh. The dressing was really tasty and the lettuce was perfectly cut so I didn't have a hard time eating it politely. Everyone in our party had a different salad and they all looked delicious.It was also very reasonable for a place I would typically think of as extravagant! Our bill came to just over $100 for 5 people before tip.  Before this meal, I never would have thought of coming to the Carlton for something other than business. Now, I would welcome the opportunity.",

    "text": "My boyfriend found The Carlton from searching online for restaurants to go to for an early Valentine's Day dinner on Friday night. I had no idea where we were going and was a little thrown off when we walked into the BNY Mellon Center. As soon as we walked into The Carlton I had a feeling I would like it due to the amount of wine they had lining the walls! The atmosphere was dark and cozy, and it was an older crowd inside. I think I might have been the youngest person in there! We had 7:30 reservations and it was busy until we left around 10.   To start, we ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir. They had just about any price range of wine from $16-$160. Chris and I aren't huge wine connoisseurs so we went with a mid price range bottle. We also got the shishito peppers for an appetizer. These were served with a corn and sausage dipping sauce. It was pretty good but I wish it was a little spicier. After chatting, eating, and finishing bottle of wine #1 we ordered a second bottle and our entrees. I was feeling adventurous and ordered the Barramundi entree. I've never even heard of this fish but she said it was a white fish similar to Sea bass. It was served with shrimp too! The side was a tomato and basil Risotto and some kind of leafy vegetable (can't remember).  The fish was seasoned with Cajun flavors and was super flavorful, I also loved the risotto! Chris ordered the pork chop that was was served with a sausage hash and had a BBQ glaze on top. We both agreed it was kind of a random concoction but it worked.   Our waitress was also very nice and the perfect amount of attentive. She knew we were looking for a nice night out to enjoy each others company so she never tried to rush us which I am always appreciative of. The Carlton is a nice old school restaurant, as Chris said he wasn't in the mood for anything \"hipster & trendy\" so he hit the nail on the head with The Carlton!",

However, the setup, decor, and prices of the place all would indicate the place is on the level with places like Capital Grille, McCormick & Schmick's, etc., however the food quality is just not there.  I have had several different things here.  Twice I have had the burger.  Once I had crab cakes and another time I had sued & turf.  The crab cakes were the best out of the things I have had, and paired really well with the dijon cream sauce that came with it.  Overall though it was nothing special and did not contain nearly enough crab meat.  The surf and turf was tiny and over cooked.  The burger, which I had heard great things about, tasted more like meatloaf than a burger.  On top of that, both times I have ordered the burger it has been closer to well done than my requested medium rare.  The flavor of the beef and toppings were still enough to make for a good burger, but like I said you expect more from a place that presents itself the way the Carlton does.",

From the moment we walked into the establishment there was a sense of welcoming and warm. The hostess made sure the seating, parking, and coat check were taken care of. The waitress also did a great job throughout the night. She even brought a little candle to the table upon request.   The meal courses/ wine pairings were equally as good. The flavor profiles of all the food all worked well together. I highly recommend the Braised Beef Tips. Great menu for restaurant week.",

If you're looking for a fancier white table cloth dinner in downtown Pittsburgh, this is your place.   One of the great perks offered is a limo service to any of the local shows and free parking so its very convenient. The wine list is probably the most extensive I've seen and the wine is fairly priced.  However, the reason it isn't my favorite is I think the food is safe. While safe means is good and means it is consistently that way, there was nothing that wowed me. Additionally a big area of improvement, and maybe this is because I'm a gen Z'er, would be adding music to the restaurant. I think the atmosphere would be drastically improved just with some tunes.   Definitely a quality place overall though and you can't beat the free parking and limo service.",

It has its own parking garage, and parking is comped for restaurant guests! Score! We chose The Carlton for restaurant week specially because the $35 menu was surf AND turf! We both had the tomato crab bisque as our first choice and it was to die for!! As someone who loves tomato bisque and crab bisque, it was truly the best combo! For the surf options, my husband had the tomato pesto salmon and I had the grouper with lobster remoulade. The salmon was absolutely delicious, but the grouper was an absolute let down! The \"lobster remoulade\" was really one small bite of lobster in what tasted like sour cream. And my fish was SO small. Honestly 3 bites max.  However, we both got the prime rib and it was excellent. That was definitely the best part of the meal. When I made the reservation on Open Table, I made a note that our anniversary was coming up. I totally forgot that I did that, but the waitress brought out a fully size cookie sundae with a candle and \"happy anniversary\" written on. She also boxed up our desserts from the pre fixed menu to go. I thought that was a really nice gesture. The service was fantastic. Our water glasses were never empty (always a huge bonus) and the staff were all incredibly nice.  I gave 4 stars for 2 main reasons: the food was great, but the portions were small. My fish was so tiny and it was served with about 3 bites of potatoes. Second, all the food was served room temp. The fact that my prime rib wasn't hot meant that it was cooking while sitting and I hate that!  All in all, I would return to The Carlton and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice evening out!",

But if you're looking for helpful & friendly service, an extensive & fairly priced wine list, and classic food, then this is a good place.  It won't be the most memorable meal of your life, but I don't think you'll regret it either.  Their menu changes a little each day.  My favorite is the NY Strip with the Jack Daniels glaze and blue cheese crumbles.  Don't be confused this isn't the TGI Fridays Jack Daniels glaze.  It's always available, even if you can't find it on the menu, just ask.  Other popular items are the sole and Beef Wellington.  This is also a great place to eat before a Penguins game.  Though it's a place that would usually draw a dressy crowd, they don't mind the Penguins jerseys on game nights.  They'll get you in and out before the drop of the puck and you won't feel rushed.  They also will validate your parking at the garage in the basement of the building, so hand your ticket to the hostess.",

Although you are not going to find a lot of trendy items in the entree selection, the lack of such items keeps the Carlton True to form as a classic American upscale restaurant. I have eaten dinner and lunch about 45 times at the Carlton and never had a bad meal or poor service. The wine list is quite deep and the selections are excellent. (You can find some deals on the wine list with modest markup despite the PA state store monopoly) For regulars, this is the kind of place that will remember your name, what you drink and who your friends are and how they've been. You don't get that at even more expensive places or private clubs anymore. Get the filet mignon rare with asparagus and the garlic mash and ask for the bernaise sauce on the side. (You have to ask for the fillet it is not in the big list of entrees) Let the server pick you a full bodied red by the glass to go with it and you will be on a whole new level of epic. Finish the meal off with their signature whisky bread pudding paired with a single malt scotch or decent port and you will never feel better legally.",

One positive thing I can say is the waiter was thorough and very helpful with suggestions, etc.  I started off with gnocchi appetizer which was his suggestion, not bad.  I would rate it a B average.  I was torn between the prime rib and the lamb chops, he suggested the prime rib.  I got the prime rib cooked to the chef's suggestion, came out about med-rare but WAS NOT HOT.  To say it was warm might have been pushing it.  Lack of flavor with the beef is an understatement.  I wasn't impressed at all. The mashed potatoes weren't hot either.  I was pretty disappointed to say the least.    A few friends recommended the prime rib and when I told them about my experience they were shocked.  I wouldn't waste the money to go back thats for sure!.  If another birthday or event got scheduled there I would most likely attend but it's not a place I would suggest.    For the price the food wasn't impressive AT ALL.  The best part of the evening was the 8.00 coffee i had at the end of the night.  The other plus about this place is if you park in the BNY Mellon garage they validate your parking ticket at the hostess stand.",

Staff was excellent but the menu was limited in scope with regards to both seafood and steak. Two basic choices for fish and two for meat with none of the traditional steak cuts. Was hoping for a better dining experience as this is touted as a local landmark but was disappointed. Can't say I would go out of my way when next in town.",

Tonight was a bit of a different experience. I think the waitress may have exchanged 25 words with us in 1.5 hours. The service was fine but I felt like I was at Olive Garden. I am normally a 20% or more tipper no matter what. But I showed her... 15% is all she got! She did not even deserve that!",

    "text": "I feel a bit bad about this 2 stars. But really unless you like conservative, bland to my taste, 80s style, steak house food. Maybe the steak is good but we didn't try it. Recommended for Grandparents with conservative palates and sentiment for the 80s.  Service - the bright note here, very nice.  Atmosphere - think 80s clubby steakhouse style. The bathrooms were stinky and not updated.  Food - we ordered 3 appetizers and a salad:  Okay iceberg with blue cheese dressing salad;  very bland dry crostini with \"roasted vegetables\" with almost no taste, maybe no salt, possibly no oil and dry - yes dry - mesclun mix like you might buy at Costco;  bbq shrimp had a slightly red sauce that had a gravy taste (some kind of stock?) and virtually no flavor and 5 shrimp - not even jumbo - with more dry mesclun for I think $11;  a good value gnocchi with plenty of chunks not shards of lobster and crab - would have been very very good if served on the sauce instead of drenched in the creamy rich cheesy sauce and with a dose of some flavor - still good. Bread from Breadworks - good of course.  Price - 3 appetizers, 1 salad, 1 glass of wine, 1 soda plus tax and tip = $75.",

    "text": "Excellent food served excellently. The decor is definitely old-school steakhouse, but that doesn't matter when you have one of the dishes placed before you. The crabcake appetizer is creamy and nicely sauced, the gnocchi and lobster appetizer is heaven. I've had nearly all of the entrees there over the years, and I've never been disappointed. The consistency in the food is also admirable.  The Carlton is known for its great wines (and the servers are well-versed in them). All in all, it's a very nice special-occasion restaurant.",

    "text": "We went early (about 5:00) on a Saturday. The food was reasonable, although the quality was a bit poor given the price. For example, the scallops were nickel-sized on a $30 entre. The main issue was that after we paid, but still had desert and drinks in front of us, the waiter began not-so-subtly urging us to leave. We were still finishing our drinks the second time he bugged us to move on, and that isn't really appreciated, no matter how much you're paying for a meal. We won't go back.",

    "text": "The Carlton is a staple in the city of Pittsburgh.  The restaurant is in located in one BNY Mellon Center.  Nationally recognized, the Carlton is the only eatery and recipient of the Distinguished Restaurant of North America Award.  Kevin Joyce, the owner and proprietor, is quite proud of this fact.  If you choose to dine at the Carlton, you will see Mr. Joyce on a regular basis; he likes to be in the thick of things.  Kevin also is actively involved in local politics- it's been rumored that he will one day run for Mayor.  The Carlton has an extensive wine list, with over 550 selections; the wine is very reasonably priced, significantly below that of his competitors.  If you're looking for a great place to relax and unwind after work, you can't go wrong at the bar. The walls are decorated with caricatures of regulars and other famous people that have eaten at the restaurant.  The bar is stocked with top shelf liquor; aged scotch, bourbon, and of course, wine any of the more 550 wine selections!  If you need to vent, the bartenders are always friendly, and happy to lend an ear.  The food at the Carlton is top shelf as well.  You can get almost anything you want from Chilean Sea Bass, to a piece of Rib Roast- which I highly recommend.  We opted for the Calamari for a starter.  It was crisp and fresh, nicely seasoned and served with a tomato-basil sauce; excellent.  The crab cakes were also good, with julienne vegetables and a Dijon-cream sauce.  The dinner salad was comprised of field greens, tomatoes with lemon-honey vinaigrette.  For my entree, I chose the grilled Atlantic salmon.  The salmon was seasoned, and cooked to a perfect medium, also very good.  My guests had the Rack of Lamb ($33.95) and the Herb Grilled Chicken ($27.95).  The lamb was tender and juicy, and the chicken was quite good too, with hints of rosemary, garlic and spicy olive oil.  Our waiter was attentive, but didn't bother us too much- a good combination.  Other entrees on the menu include: Ahi Tuna ($27.95), Grouper ($30.95), and Sea Scallops ($32.95).  If there's something you want that's not on the menu, just ask, and Chef Mark Swomley will prepare it for you.  The menus are seasonal, so you can always count on a wide variety of selections during the year.  In addition to the regular menu, The Carlton also offers wine dinners.  The special meals include several courses of meticulously prepared food with some of the finest wines of the region; a rare and special treat.       My favorite part of eating at the Carlton- the desserts; they're all made in-house by the pastry chef.  Try the creme brulee, or the chocolate cake.  There are many different kinds of deliciousness too choose from, just make sure to try something!  If you're looking for the best birthday cakes in the city, order one from Eadie's on the first floor, also owned by Mr. Joyce.  If you haven't sampled the food at the Carlton, make a reservation soon. The Carlton Restaurant 500 Grant Street Pittsburgh, PA 15219-2502 (412) 391-4099",

    "text": "This is a good place to take your parents or to have a business event.  The location is right in the city (mellon center).  The bar is relatively small with most seating in old leather chairs and some table tops.  The decor is definitely old school with the wallpaper being golfers in traditional garb in a picturesque (sp?), 1920's scene with girls golfing in dresses.  The rest of the restaurant is dark wood, leather, and white tops.  The servers are dressed in tuxes or suits and in my experience are True professionals.  I have a couple business dinner parties here a year and have always been extremely pleased.  I've never come here on a date and I suggest if you are under 50 there are much better date spots to take your partner.  However, for all its old school charm the menu can be occassionally surprisingly nuanced and fresh.  My favorite is to have the wine dinners here.  The chef truly is talented and always comes up with something surprising and delicious.  Also, props need to be paid to Kevin Joyce for fighting this damn county drink tax.  He also serves some of the best, reasonably priced wine in the city and has been for decades.  I didn't do the wine tasting dinner last night, but instead went a more traditional route offering multiple entree choices.  The dinner starts with either a carlton salad or soup of the day.  The carlton salad looked awesome, romaine, tomatoes, mushrooms, bacon, hard boiled egg and creamy dressing (definitely not for the dieter).  The soup I had last night was the three food groups, those being cheese, bacon, and potatoes.  The soup was obviously heavy, but I found way too salty and in general not a good choice for me.  It sat in my stomach like a sock full of nickels.  Many ordered the seafood wellington, which I've had before and it's another non-dieter dish comprising of pastry, sole, lobster, crab and cheese.  This dish is definitely rich and tasty.  I tried the prime rib, which was about an average tasting non- \"prime\" prime rib with plenty of marbeling and cooked well enough.  However, I've had just as good prime rib if not better at Outback.  The most delicious presentation goes to the veal portabello which is sauteed veal with capers adn mushrooms, whipped potatoes and a nice tomato beurre blanc.  Sadly, I didn't get a chance to try this.  I was told it was delicious.  The desserts were all good and most likely prepared in house.  I tried the award winning chocolate cheesecake which was very good.  I only wish they had some lighter dessert options like berries.  All in all a great restaurant for the older crowd or business events.  The servers, especially Faye are awesome.  Last night Faye literally chased me down the parking garage to give me my leftovers.  The food deserves 3 stars, the servers 4 stars, and the wine prices and Kevins anti tax efforts 5 stars.  This is a True Pittsburgh institution.",
