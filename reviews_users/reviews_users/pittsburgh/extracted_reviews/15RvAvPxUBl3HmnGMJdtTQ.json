They are always very nice to my daughter when we come in and they will give her little treats sometimes. The sushi is very good and unlike some Sushi places they do not skimp on the wasabi or ginger. The portion sizes are huge. When I order something it feeds me dinner and then lunch the next day. Therefore, the prices are worth it. Also, when you call to place an order they actually don't rush you on the phone, and they will answer your questions. One of the most impressive things about them is when they say your food will be ready in 15 minutes IT IS.  I highly recommend this place, Osaka is great.",

There's one waitress who is not as attentive but the others are exemplary. Owners are friendly, too. I moved to Beaver County for a while -- when I returned two years later and dined here again, the waitress named my favorite dishes and asked if that's what I'd be ordering!   The scallion pancakes are fab. Get them! Also, get a house salad. It's your typical mundane iceberg and carrot kind of medley but the dressing -- they make a unique ginger salad dressing that is heaven in your mouth. You'll be cleaning it from your plate. I recommend the scallion pancakes for that, or anything, really -- I'd eat a handful of foam packing peanuts if they had this salad dressing on it.  Like other reviewers have said, try the tea smoked duck. It's wonderful with hoisin (as they serve it with) or cold at 2am in the lurid glow of your fridge light.",

The reason is probably because they serve sushi and sashimi here.    Otherwise this place seems like it's pretty much your typical Americanized Chinese food restaurant with your typical lunch menu.  There's a difference though.  The food here is really really good!  In fact they charge a couple of bucks more than most places for their lunch menu but it's worth it.  I went for my usual Chicken & Broccoli, however the chicken was very tender and juicy and the broccoli was crisp and fresh.  The spring roll was very light and melted in my mouth.  Someone else said this place is possibly second only to Chinatown Inn for this type of chow.  Hmmm--I'd say first Chinatown Inn, then Sesame Inn & Osaka in a tie for second.",

After catering an event we hosted and knowing the owner for years, we've grown quite close to this restaurant since it first opened.   Onto a review. Decor is pretty simple, very   Nice and clean, but not too formal. Kids are welcome, the servers are nice. The food is delicious, and I always come here as it is a quick local stop. When I don't want to go out, takeout works perfectly. This is my favorite restaurant in my area.   Onto dishes I recommend. The orange beef or chicken is great. If you don't like your chicken fried or would like to eat a bit healthier, they are fine with a different way to cook it if you ask. Also, the sesame beef and fried rice are great. We always order the string beans too. Every appetizer I've had was great, and I only recall one not-so-great meal there a few years ago with the beef with broccoli because the sauce was bland. The owner will also often come out and talk to the diners, when he's there. Not always though, because he may cook at times or the restaurant is packed (it's busy when we go.)  Go. It is a great experience, much better than what the other people say. Try it!",

I had a two color roll, it was pretty standard, yet still flavorful.  I also had the eel, which I really couldnt not tell you what kind as I let the waiter surprise me.  I was a cube of rice topped with a piece of cooked eel that had been braised in a very tasty sauce.  I actually really liked the eel and wished I would have ordered more and not had the roll.

First, the staff is so kind and when you're a regular, they remember you and it creates a great sense of community the way they pay attention to their customers.   One of my favorite things about this place is the free \"appetizer\" of fried wonton \"chips\" I believe they're called that they give to every table with dipping sauces. Who doesn't love a bowl of fried dough? It's like eating the best part of the eggroll (which, by the way, their egg rolls are also top knotch. I've only ever preferred Mark Pi's China Gate eggrolls more but they are closed now). I also love their house salad with the ginger dressing. Their dressing is creamier than most but is so good you could drink it like soup.  Their sushi is of amazing quality. I've had just about every roll there, and I have never had questionable fish quality and consistently good flavor. I've been to decent places that sometimes haven't thawed the fish out entirely or on the salmon sashimi there's some graying of the fish - never at Osaka. 100% perfect every time. The sushi boats are great for groups as well.   Their non-sushi dishes are delicious as well, reasonable portions that leave you full with maybe some leftovers but don't intimidate you either.   I always get a pot of their hot black tea or a Sapporo beer.",

The rice and hunan sauce was so delicious too. They weren't stingy with the shrimp either which were cooked to perfection! They cooked with the jumbo shrimp! The food came quick and the service was great!",

The main draw for me was that they delivery from open to close, which is really rare in the area.  Most only do dinner.  The food: nothing special, but not bad either. It's standard americanized Chinese fare, especially in the context of Pittsburgh. I think there has been a price hike recently, but the lunch special is still a good deal.   Word of caution: cold sesame noodles are extra peanuty here.   I forgot that I actually had sushi here a long time - the rolls I'd eaten before had been good - fresh fish, reasonable portions for the price. The sashimi lunch special - very generous portions consisting of 12 large cut pieces of fish and puts it at ~$1 per piece,  but the quality of the fish is mediocre. Quality vs quantity.... Personally, I started to feel a little sick. but if you're not the type to care, definitely go for it.  3.5 stars. The food does the job. more importantly, it gets it to me when i need it. I'll probably keep coming here when I'm in town.",

    "text": "To celebrate Kay's new job, I whisked her over to Osaka in Greentree in the middle of last week for an extraordinary dinner. Located in a secret shopping center in the clouds, its eclectic coterie of neighbors includes Tamarind, Il Burloni, and Mad Mex.   Osaka serves a mix of both Japanese and Chinese dishes, but since we've grown weary of sushi and sashimi, we opted for hot dishes in lieu of cold.   Thankfully, we eschewed appetizers and went right for the mammoth entrees, both of which we narrowly finished.   I chose the Sizzling Red Snapper with Vegetables, a dish that lived up to its name in nearly  pyrotechnic fashion. Fried in an aurelian tempura-battered snapper and surrounded by the freshest of broccoli, infant corn cobs, and carrot slats, the fish was splashed with a salty, sticky, nebulous sauce (soy sauce?) upon service while on a hot plate, making for a steaming spectacle that caused much rubbernecking. The fish itself was as flaky, fragile, and savory as that which comes in newspaper cones from the UK, the vegetables acting as a grassy, earthy complement.   Kay's Tea Smoked Duck carried with it an esoteric essence that permeated the lardy, lusty flesh of the dismembered bird.   With no desserts of interest to us, our low-keyed and decidedly competent server brought to us a slew of orange wedges at the conclusion of our dinner. A swell, uncomplicated touch of hospitality and gratitude it was, and we appreciated it immensely.   Don't let the lack of hype dissuade you from journeying to the southern suburbs for Osaka's tiptop Asian fare. There is no teppanyaki nightclub flash to be found here, only serene ambience, pearly, elegantly elementary decor, and superb Oriental pabulum prepared with honor and great skill.",

Have tried a number of selections, in place of my favorite Pad Thai, and each has proven fairly tasteless.  Overall this restaurant is not bad as far as run of the mill restaurants go. Fairly priced (lunch), reasonably clean, half decent service, ample portions and good variety of choices. However, if the food has no taste what is the point of dining at Osaka? Going to give it one more try and if the same thing happens it will be time to move on. Would be curious to know if other patrons share my observation.",

Bear in mind, earlier that day I had left over pierogies and tres leches cake, sweetened bubble tea, thai coffee, and some strange chocolate peanut butter seaweed bar that I got in the strip district. That said, I really wasn't feeling any food. Turns out that those noodles and the chicken were exactly what I needed to make me feel nourished and replenished. Typically I would get a box since I can never finish restaurant sized portions, until today. While this place is by no means an exotic or high end gourmet establishment, it happened to be exactly what the doctor ordered. To me, little comes close to the satisfaction one feels after devouring your entire plate, and the fact that I did is proof positive that I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. The noodles were the perfect texture as was the chicken and the taste was just right. Heck I paid more for that gourmet chocolate seaweed bar than I did for this meal, which was far more satisfying. To add, the young lady serving us was extremely nice and caring. She would come by to check on us often asking how we were doing and if we needed more water or wonton strips. Her demeanor was extremely pleasant and sincere. You simply can't beat that for $11.77. I need to take my friend's recommendations more often.",

I've been coming to Osaka for a little over a year and a half now, and I've never been disappointed. Typically my experiences here have mostly been getting take-out, but I've had a couple dine-in experiences as well. From what I recall dining in was as pleasant as can be, no complaints there. On cold, rainy, days, however, there aren't many things I enjoy more than getting some good takeout to enjoy while wearing sweats in the comfort of my own home. Osaka has been a part of countless takeout nights between my boyfriend and I, and this is usually where I order takeout from when my brother is visiting, too.  My favorite roll has always been the Philly roll, and Osaka makes a mean one! This past weekend I got a Fantasy roll (Tobiko, tuna, and avocado), and a shrimp tempura roll. The pieces of fish were all rather generous and all of the ingredients seemed fresh as can be. I'm always a happy camper when I get some good sushi. Some of my other favorite rolls I've had here are the sunshine roll (tuna and white tuna), rock & roll (toasted salmon, eel, avocado, cucumber, and tobiko), and nearly any other roll I've tried. Usually I don't go all out with the super-complex rolls, but once in a while you have to treat yourself!  On to the dinner foods. My boyfriend has recently been ordering lamb every time we go out for Asian food, and he seemed to be pretty impressed with the portion size and quality of the lamb and scallions he ordered this past Saturday. During past visits I've ordered orange chicken, honey chicken, and General Tso's (basic, I know), and they were all amazing. They usually put takeout in a brown paper bag and even 1 person's order looks like enough to feed a small family. Pricing is comparable to other similar restaurants, but I've never complained about the price for as much food as you get here.  Overall there is nothing bad I can really say about Osaka off the top of my head. If anything, a pointer I have for newcomers is to not trust your GPS because it won't take you to the correct turn to get into Scott Towne Center. This was confusing at first, but it was so worth it once I made it to the restaurant!",

    "text": "We went to this restaurant a few days ago. The waitress named Tina who took the order was extremely rude. We took like 5 minutes to check the menu and she just can't wait. She just sat on the chair and played her cellphone seemed like she's the customer. They should have other good waiters in the restaurant but this one is definitely rude and has no respect for the guests at all. As the result, feeling really bad the whole night with just average food. I don't think I'm the first person complaint about her. Not recommended at all.",

    "text": "Big sushi craving tonight and ordered way too much, so I guess I'm having sushi again for breakfast or lunch tomorrow. Everything I ordered was good. Sushi - ikura, eel, and salmon. Especially generous cuts of salmon. Maki - salmon roll, avocado roll, caterpillar roll and dragon roll. Next time I'll get out a sharp knife and cut each piece of the salmon roll and avocado roll in half for twelve bite size pieces instead of six too-big pieces. It turns out the caterpillar roll and dragon roll are exactly the same except the caterpillar roll is made with shrimp tempura and the dragon roll is made with eel. I preferred the caterpillar roll. There are still so many other things I want to try, so I'll be ordering again, but maybe half as much, twice as often!",

    "text": "I wish I could give this restaurant a higher rating but it just doesn't deserve it. For food I would give it a 4 but for service a 3 at best. First time trying this restaurant we found just accidentally driving up in the Greentree plaza. The Italian restaurant next door Il Burnio was packed with no room but Osaka was completely open, looked very clean and new, and my husband was starving so we decided to give it a try. Even though there were only 2 other diners in the restaurant, our waiter was not friendly and did the bare minimum. He almost seemed agitated. The food was very good - we ordered Thai Chicken and Basil Beef. The Basil Beef was supposed to come on a hot plate (which it did) but when aj asked if I could have some spice added to it the waiter said no it could not come on a hot plate (?). Meal ended nicely with orange slices and fortune cookies. Ambiance, meh. Too bright lighting. Guessing this place is new and hoping they can improve. I wouldn't dine in again - would opt for takeout.",

    "text": "Stopped in for lunch with a work colleague as this was close to his office. We split a yellow tail-jalapeno appetizer which for $10 came with only six pieces. It was nice that the jalapenos were spicy for once but it was a rather small appetizer compared to what I have had before.  I also had a miso soup, which was a bit on the sweet side, and a seaweed salad which was larger than normal.  I also had a yellow tail/scallion roll and a Inferno roll. Both had a bit too much rice but were fresh. The Inferno roll was quite good since it was also spicy.  Service was a bit spotty since our waitress did not speak very good English and brought out items at different times then we requested.",

They have always contacted me when there was an issue.  I typically have the philly roll, salmon roll and spicy California roll.  Very good.  The steamed dumplings are also a favorite of mine.  Everything always arrives hot and neat.",
