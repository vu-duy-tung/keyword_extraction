    "text": "Came here yesterday with family after a long day moving in to my apartment, starving in need of a good meal and better beer and we weren't disappointed. The place is a sit yourself, sports style bar that wasn't packed even though it was 6pm on a Saturday. With that said, I have to say I am honestly suprised it wasn't out the door busy. Regarding the menu, the beer selection is especially huge and fairly priced and features everything from stouts to fruit beers and everything between. It's food selection is slightly more limited comparatively as it's more bar food oriented but was still delicious. I myself ordered the Cuban while other members of my family ordered pulled pork sandwiches or the various burgers. As I said before, the food was delicious but the portions, oh my were they filling, my sister couldn't even finish her sandwich. After receiving the check we were even more shocked due to how cheap it was. A family of four getting full meals and 5 beers between them in most other places would usually run up to $80 or $90 anywhere else, but not here. All in all, I would definitely tell anyone to come to this place, it's great food, great beer, and great pricing.",

I finally had to stop another server and ask if she knew who our server was. A girl and someone she was training finally came over and said \"sorry we thought someone was already helping you\" well....is this your section or not? because if it is, then that person would be YOU! long story short.....We were constantly waiting for her to come back and we did not see her helping any other tables so it's not like she was crazy busy and not coming back--she simply was not coming back to check on us. My drink sat empty for the last 20 minutes we were there.   The wings were good but not worth waiting for if the service is going to be like that. My friend got nachos and they just didn't taste right.   overall i will probably never go back to this place...especially if the service is like that. and she should never train someone again. ever.",

They clearly train there staff well b/c they can tell you most anything you would like to know about a new tap. The food is good but it's typical bar food.  Nothing that is so stellar I would need to call it out, but if you're going to drink some delicious brews you will have your pick of delicious munchies. This place does get packed for games, so if you're planning on catching one arrive early!  They are happy to accommodate groups.  We had my bf's last birthday party there, and the waitress was very helpful with concealing the cake in the back until it was time. :) I would not bring kids here.  It's too bar in my humble opinion. My one complaint about Hough's is the parking. It's street only, so if they're busy you're going to be driving around the neighborhood trying to find something.",

I haven't had the chance to try their food yet, but I am sure that I will some time if I return to their trivia.   I went to a very packed house for trivia and could barely get a seat, but the waitress managed to find two seats to accommodate my husband and I with our group. During trivia the service was not overwhelmingly impressive, but I totally understand due to just how many people were at this place. On previous occasions, the waitress was on top of it the whole time. In every occasion, the waitresses were quite knowledgeable on the beer selection and were able to recommend a few new things for hubby and I to try.   In terms of trivia, I did not care for their format. There did not appear to be an MC, the questions would pop on the TV screen and were given 5 questions of a given category and had a certain amount of time to answer them. There were 5 rounds. The one thing that I did like was that they had an answer runner, so if this person came to your table you knew your time was up. But honestly I like the format where you are given a question of any category and have the length of a song to answer it, that way you can fit more categories. Having 5-7 questions on state mottos is just a little nuts, but whatever.   Anyway besides their trivia format, I like this place and would love to come back for a few more brews.",

    "text": "I've been putting off writing this review because I go there so often and love the selection of beers, but the food has more often than not been worthy of only 3 stars. So why the 4 star review?  Houghs pays attention.   I'd been hearing about a new menu debut from servers for a long while, and finally saw the changes over the past few months. Many of the items that I wasn't so fond of in the past were off the menu (someone, somewhere is keeping track of the unpopular items which is great). They added multiple new wing flavors, a larger selection of smoked items, and a few other new sandwiches and salads. They've also given the people more of what they want - brunch! Previously served only on Sunday's, they've now added on a Saturday brunch as well. Now, for the remainder of my review...  The bright side: - insane beer selection. Insane. The Brewery of the Month idea? Genius. I've tried a number of hard-to-find brews from some of my favorite breweries as a result. They also have numerous events each month related to the brewery - usually trivia night winner swag, special brunches, etc. I have even taken friends who don't like beer and they still find something to fit their taste (usually a fruitier brew). This is what keeps me coming back and keeps others curious. - Certain menu items are consistent and tasty (fried chicken sandwich, veggie chorizo sandwich) - The environment (for the most part) is welcoming, noisy without being too loud, and fun. And if that isn't the most GD gorgeous wooden bar top, then I dunno what is. - Great Bloody Mary bar during brunch AND they serve you a Miller High Life pony bottle alongside. That's just fun and fantastic. (Luckily, I live within walking distance haha)  My gripes: - Someone behind the concept of Hough's is head-over-heels in love with beer, but it is not the people serving me my beer. Don't get me wrong, the service is always friendly and I've never had a problem. It is just odd that such a beer centric place doesn't have waitstaff that are singing the praises of the brews - the place needs a hostess/host. I know it's \"sit wherever\" style and I like that relaxed feel and it works great for non-busy hours. But dinner time on a Friday night? A hostess is necessary. I think it is a turn-off for older people or newcomers when they enter a crowded place with nobody to direct them - The place all but shuts down once the kitchen closes. It is off-putting if you are sitting at the bar enjoying beers when all the tables around the bar have the seats overturned and ready for close. I'm sure that is part of the closing duties for the servers, but I wish there was a way around it. This is the kind of place where people SHOULD be welcome to drink until close, even if the kitchen is closed.",

Hough's has been serving the community of Greenfield since 2008 and the upper level most definitely resembles a neighborhood dive. That's cool with me; I love dive bars. It's comfortable, but also clean and inviting which can be a hard balance to strike. Down a small stair you get to a heavily wooded area. Big wood wall with about 65 taps, woot tables and a wood bar. Very reminiscent of a German beer hall. The smell of malted cereal grains from next door's Copper Kettle Brewing pervades the space.   The beer selection is well above par. Too many to choose from. On top of that they are all poured in correct glassware. They also feature a cocktail menu worthy of a downtown mixology bar.   The food here is decent too. We opted just for appetizers but we loved them. The menu is mostly bar food, but at least it's well done bar food. We had the wings in a honey chipotle sauce and pulled pork nachos. The wings were great but the nachos, while good, said they had beer cheese on them. Not so. I have been to a lot of ball parks and I know canned nacho cheese when I see it. Thats why they lose a star for me.   All in all I like Hough's. It's a great neighborhood bar that has a great beer selection in a relaxed unpretentious atmosphere. I will most certainly be back.",

It was some kind of boxed pasta in an ok-ish broth with a slab of pork fat. I was told that it usually comes with a fried egg, but they ran out.  Thanks.   I could (and probably will) go home and have some nong shim spicy ramen that is eminently more satisfying.   Total waste of time and I won't be back.",

    "text": "Of all the neighborhood bars I've had living in seven different locations in Pittsburgh over the past 12 years, Hough's is by far my favorite.  Here's why it's awesome: 1.) Excellent beer selection.  I admit it, I'm a bit of a beer novice.  I stick to what I know - lagers, pilsners, and the occasional brown ale.  However, for real beer lovers, this is a great place.  I believe they have something in the range of 50-60 beers on TAP at any given time.  Not to mention the bottle selection.  Growlers to go if you're interested. 2.) WANGZ.  Wednesday is wing night.  It's packed.  Why?  Because these wings are big, juicy, freshly made (you'll wait 10-15 min per order... warning clearly stated on the menu), and the sauces & dry dubs are A-MAH-ZING (that's for you, MH). 3.) Buttered, toasted buns on all the sandwiches/burgers.  May seem like a trivial thing, but I tell you, when you chomp into a Chicken Cheese Steak and you get a burst of buttery toasted goodness, you'll know what I'm talkin' 'bout.  One downside (which I won't even factor into my overall rating) is that they are closed on Sunday's (except Steeler Sundays, of course... they aren't uncivilized).  I feel like Hough's could really corner the Sunday afternoon breezy beer drinking occasion.  Eh, I guess bartenders can have days off too.  PS - The chili also rocks.  Try it on their house-made chips. PPS - This review makes me want to run a few miles and eat a salad.",

The food is fine, and your beer will make it taste better, but is nothing to write home about, though I've noticed that it is improving (adding a good chicken and waffle sandwich has that effect). Having said that, the pretzels with beer cheese are good, and actually, you should just ask them to put the beer cheese on any and everything you order. The beer selection is fantastic, the screens are always carrying Pittsburgh sports, and the people are friendly and True. I've since moved across town, but Hough's is still my favorite place to meet friends. Parking can be tricky as this is the middle of a residential neighborhood, and now there's a popular escape room across the street (by the way, go there--it's great--and then go over to Hough's to talk about how fun it was), but I've never been more than a block or two away. You should go here, if you haven't already.",

    "text": "First off, let me say that I love Hough's as a beer bar. Best in the city I've found in two years of living here. However, they recently changed their food menu when they hired a chef and while the food was average to good with big portions before, it is now completely unimpressive with smaller portions for the same price. I had the mesquite chicken sandwich and it was supposed to be smoked but actually only tasted like grilled chicken with barbecue sauce and cole slaw on it. I can make it better at home. My girlfriend had the Reuben. This used to be one of their best. Tons of nice pieces of corned beef on huge rye bread. Now it comes on a sickly pumpernickel roll with a quarter of the meat. I've also had the nachos which are a quarter of the size as before for the same price and the new black bean dip which is not worth the 8 dollars.  The saving grace food wise at Hough's are the wings. They are still quite good. Wednesday is wing night for 50 cents a wing but the special is eat in only. No taking dinner home for a nice price. Hough's needs to get back to it's roots and be a great neighborhood bar with good pub grub. The menu had been getting stale but the change they made was too extreme.   My rating is for the beer and the awesome bartenders only. Food is one star now. I can't give a higher rating until they change the food menu back our into something different. The new chef did the classic Food Network revamp of a kitchen and screwed it up bad. Please change Hough's, I've noticed less people in the bar the two times I was there this week. I hope this doesn't ruin what was a good thing.",

My friends and I used to go there every Tuesday for trivia! The games are fun, and the girls who usually run it are very nice. Sometimes it gets really loud and it's hard to hear, but sometimes different breweries will come and give out prizes and offer tastings. It's pretty fun.  The beer selection is insane, way better than any other bar I've been to in the area. They offer a couple of different sizes, so you can order small little taster sizes if you want to try a few different kinds. I'm not much of an adventurous spirit when it comes to beer, but I do appreciate the variety of ciders they have included! :) I haven't found anything on the food menu though that has impressed me. Nothing I've had has tasted bad or anything, but it's pretty bland and generic and nothing to write home about.  Hough's is a nice place to go and watch a game. I'ts pretty big for Pittsburgh standards, and there are plenty of tables and TVs available.   Just go seat yourself. Sometimes it takes a server awhile to get to you for some reason, but on the up side, that just gives you more time to look over the expansive beer menu.",

    "text": "It's been a few years since I've been here, but friends who live in the neighborhood always talk about how it's a great neighborhood pub and family-friendly, etc., so I stopped by with my kids after some time at the playground on a Friday afternoon, for an early dinner.  It wasn't busy, so that was great. There were several other families there with small kids.   We were there around 5pm, and I was pleasantly surprised that it was happy hour (4pm-6pm), so there were food and beer specials. Our server was very friendly and helpful, but we had some miscommunication about the menu.  It's hard to read a menu with 2 toddlers in tow, so I was trying to make selections quickly. Since I've been told it's so family-friendly, I assumed they had some kind of kids menu, or, at least, smaller versions of things on their menu that can act as children's portions. I asked if there were smaller portions for kids and our server told us there was a kids menu - (but there was nothing to look at, apparently) - the \"kids menu\" is a single-patty cheeseburger and some fries or tots or 4 pierogies instead of 6.  The 5-yr-old wanted mac 'n cheese, but like most 5-yr-olds, he didn't want the bacon or tomatoes that come in it. We found out that's $11, regardless. I'm guessing they just picked the bacon out of it, because it definitely had a bacon taste (so vegetarians, beware.) My youngest wanted a cheeseburger and fries (fries were enough to split with the other kid) - that ended up being $6.  Our server had made a point of saying it was happy hour when we got there and pointed to the top left of the menu, where it said \"$5 Burgers\" so I asked about the $5 burgers, which is what I wanted, and said \"what does this mean? What are the 'burgers?'\" and she directed me to the last page of the menu, under \"Classics\" which listed one burger - a Classic Cheeseburger for $12, so I thought - OK, that's a good deal for $5, and ordered a cheeseburger, which apparently came with fries.  Then, when the bill came with my burger listed at full price, I asked why I wasn't charged the happy hour price and the waitress said - \"You said you wanted the classic cheeseburger\" and I clarified, saying \"No, I was asking about the $5 burger - that's what I wanted.\" I found out after the fact that the happy hour burger is a single patty and the regular burger on the menu is 2 patties.  How was I supposed to know that? So, they compromised and charged me $5 for my burger and $3 for my tots, so I saved $4. Fine. I'm sure it was an oversight, but, please, try to listen to your customers. If it had been very busy there, I could totally understand things getting mixed up.  Also, who doesn't know that old trick of bars making their food extra salty so that people will buy more drinks? Seriously - please lay off the rub on the burgers!  Everything was WAY too salty.  Let people add their own salt to the fries and burgers if that's the way they like it.  My poor toddler was gulping down water all night long when we got home!  Also, if you are really a family-friendly neighborhood joint, at least come up with a kids menu that has 3-4 smaller-portion items on it. It seems that they are being careful to not get a new identity as a \"family\" restaurant, but with the number of families with toddlers I saw there, I was wondering what those kids were eating, because I'm sure they weren't all eating $12 entrees. I did feel bad for our server because she seemed like she was taking on a disproportionate number of tables for a time that wasn't very busy.  Overall, I think this is a nice place, but it needs some tweaks to the menu to better accommodate kids and not just tolerate them. Keep the families with kids happy and the parents will return on other occasions without their kids.",

The environment is casual and laid-back, the bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable, and so are all the Houghs!  They have tons of TVs and are usually more than happy to take requests for games that might not be on by default.  It's a great place to watch Steelers/Pirates/Penguins games, though it's very crowded on Steeler days, and generally an awesome place for groups.  There are two bars, one on the main level (when you first enter) which is a kind of U shaped and usually a bit more crowded, and one on a lower level.  I usually go to the one on the lower level because it's a little less crowded and more intimate.  My experience with the bartenders there have been great -- they know a ton about the beers and are happy to talk to you about them.  The food is your average pub fare.  If you're interested in brewing your own beer and want a convenient way to start, be sure to check out the Copper Kettle Brewing Co (part of Hough's and located next door to the bar)!",

The food is OK. It's your typical bar food. I ordered their regular burger and was underwhelmed. I thought it tasted bland even with toppings and sauce. I ordered the egg on the burger and it was SUPER over-easy; almost to the point where it seemed like it was barely done. However, if you order the bacon with it, you get the really thick pieces of bacon and not the thin crispy pieces that seem on the cusp of being burnt. If you want a lot of choices for good beer, Hough's is the place to go. I plan on going back as much as possible.",

Parking is always easy and seating never too hard to find (though be warned, Hough's gets quite busy on Friday and Saturday nights).   My personal favorite is to get a taster size of a fruit beer or cider. Best appetizer is the soft pretzel appetizer (fried pretzels with generous salt and cheese/mustard side sauces). My favorite vegetarian entree is the Veggie Chorizo sandiwch, it is just the right amount of spicy and so much food I always take the other half home.  The super spicy burger is not to be trifled with (got it as a veggie burger, you can get any of their burgers veggie). If you get a super spicy habenero pepper bite, your dinner has ended and you will be hollering for a glass of milk (like me). So be warned.  Only reason 4 stars is because sometimes their on tap beer can be stale (because then have so many options open), though I personally haven't had this happen.

When the food finally arrived the potatoes were burned and the \"over easy\" eggs were actually \"over very hard\".  Whatever.",

    "text": "I used to think Sephora was my \"Happy Place,\" but that was until I went to Hough's.  Hough's is my happy place, and also you can't drink a beer at Sephora.  So.Many.Beers!  At reasonable prices!!!  Every time I leave the Sharp Edge I feel like I've left the bulk of my personal wealth there.  Not at Hough's!  It's everything that's good about the Sharp Edge, and you're not going to go broke.  I also really liked that the beer list was seperated by brewery, bc I am a beer snob.  Not a fan of Dogfish, but I do love my Troeg's.  I also really liked that on the back of the beer menu they offer descriptions of each of the different beers so you can sound like you know what the hell you are talking about when discussing the random beer you've just ordered.  \"I like the fruity finish of this Kolsch.  I believe this brewery is from a small basement in a small upstate NewYork town you've never heard of!\"  Pro tip:  It's winter.  Order a black IPA or a Winter Warmer, don't order a Kolsch.  Ever.  They are just not good.  My current favorite beer at Hough's is 21st Ammendment Fireside Chat.  Try it.  You'll love it.  Beer is my \"thing\" and I know what's up.  You'll like it, trust me.    I had a lot of beers.  They were good.  The waitress was knowledgeable, and according to my friend (a guy), she was also hot.  He appreciated that.  The only thing I didn't like was the cold beer cheese dip.  There are certain foods I call, \"Guy Foods.\"  Stuff guys love and chicks are grossed out by.  This was one of them, bc my friend ate the whole thing while I poked at it and said, \"Is this just a block of cream cheese with shredded cheese mixed in?\"  I'm pretty sure it was.  But my friend loved it.  I'll def be back, and you should go there too!",

The server was friendly and it feels like a classic neighborhood bar. People hanging out with friends and watching the Pirates game.   The drink selection is excellent. I love ciders and they had like 10 kinds. I tried a delicious pear and blueberry cider. One of my friends even got a 32 oz draft to go. They let you choose what you want on draft and then they can it up for you. The reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because the food was terrible. We got buffalo chicken dip and chips and the chips were stale. The dip was a bowl of nondescript orange slop. The cheese sliders were ok, but looked more like grilled cheese sandwiches. The nachos were not very good. I guess I'd give this place 4 stars if you're getting drinks but would not recommend for food.",

I just had their chicken and waffle sandwich, and I'm declaring it to be the \"Second best thing I've ever had in my mouth!\" Their \"Create-your-own Bloody Mary\" bar is both original and of the highest quality. I recommend the bacon infused vodka or the tomato basil infused. Mimosas blended just perfectly, and they have some interesting features such as beer yoga and create your own 32oz can. Next time I go back I want to book one of their create your own beer sessions, in which you get to brew your own beer, and go back three weeks later to create your own label and bottle it yourself. This bar is one of the many reasons Pittsburgh is consistently rated the best city to visit and live in, in the U.S. The Hough family are trendsetters and this is a new standard.

When I sat down, I was pretty disappointed.....I'm a beer snob and the taps at the bar were ALL (Seriously, like 20 or something) from Ithaca Brewing. Ithaca's fine, but not something I really want to drink....so I joked with the bartender about their draft list saying it would be nice if certain ones were still on. Turns out, they were. They have ANOTHER draft system down a little flight of stairs that still had a ton of great beer on! I don't know how many taps they have all together, but if you can't find something you want, it's not on their selection. Anyway, disaster averted, drinking happily.   We got the buffalo chicken dip appetizer, which was really good and not greasy, too spicy or too chunky. The only thing I would change is that I would serve it with those awesome tater tots. Still drinking happily, beer is cold and served in clean glassware. I had the Cuban for my meal....which I took most of it home. It was the first Cuban I had with bacon on it, and it really overpowered the sandwich, but not in a bad way. Still drinking happily, they have a great selection of \"normal\" beer, and an even better selection of limited beers. Everyone there seemed to be having a good time and the portions were big. It was a good experience, I will be back, drinking happily.",

    "text": "I stopped by Hough's last week to check out the bevy of beer I've been hearing about. And boy is it a bevy. It rivals Sharp Edge in quantity and quality selections but has a slight edge because it's next door to its own brewery. Copper Kettle Brewing Company churns out local suds and also allows patrons to brew their own batches. Please and thank you. That post is for another day though.  I was pleasantly surprised by Hough's when I first saw it. I had it pegged for a dark, dank, Pittsburgh-style Yinzer bar but was greeted with a bright and large space full of a diverse crowd. The bar itself was also quite large which is always convenient for the single diner/drinker. And stashed in one corner was a shuffle board! Can you feel the excitement!  Hough's had a feature beer menu and a regular beer menu. The menu is broken down by brand rather than style which can be slightly overwhelming for a beer novice like myself. The great part about the beer menu is that it offers a sample size so you can taste a beer before committing to a full pint. This proved to be a lifesaver. Or a life ruiner. Hard to say.  After I got my beer order out of the way, I got down to the really important part: food. I heard the menu had changed but not for the better. It was standard bar food selections with a few gems one of which was a Sloppy Joe. And I didn't pass that up. My dining partner wanted hummus to start with and I obliged.  The hummus arrived and was quite possibly the saddest appetizer I've ever seen. For being \"homemade,\" it sure tasted like it came out of a plastic tub. It lacked any real flavor and had the texture of wet paste. My Sloppy Joe came out soon after. It came on a semi-hard bakery-style bun that held up well to the sloppy but the meat/sauce had no tang. No zip. No personality which is the real highlight of a sloppy joe for me otherwise it's really just a hamburger with too much ketchup. And the cole slaw... so sad. It may have looked like delicious cole slaw from Chick-fil-a (blagh) but it was partially frozen and again had no flavor.  My brother joined the party a bit after we finished dinner and had the Mac-n-Cheese. It had a rich, cheesy flavor but the portion looked to be a side rather than an entree. And at the price point it's offered at was quite a disappointment.  Overall, I was a tad disappointed by the food but the beer and atmosphere made up for it.",

When the game ends, grab a few bucks and play some music on their jukebox (every band and genre you can imagine). This place gets really busy, but it's a great crowd.

The food menu was smaller in size, this is how you know they mean beer business.    Also I expected it to be a lot smaller inside - but it was huge.  And it was done up real sleek inside - not ultra modern, more like casual modern but you can tell it's gotten a face lift recently.  When I had initially gotten there on a Friday around 6 PM it wasn't that crowded but fast forward to about 8 PM and every seat was filled (bar and tables).    I had the Benko Burger and I'd have to give it 2-3 stars.  I wasn't that impressed b/c although the accessories (aka toppings) were delish the burger meat itself was gritty and chewy so I didn't finish it.  I will say that the food is very affordable - I think the burger was $7.00 and it came with fries.  But if, no when I go back, I'll probably stay away from the burgers.  I had a nut brown ale and a wheat beer and although I can't remember the breweries they were great.  I think I had the Franziskaner Wheat.  In any case, I think you really can't go wrong since they have so much of a selection.  If you truly are a beer fan you should definitely check out Hough's.",

    "text": "Greenfield doesn't have a lot, but what it does have is a little gem called Hough's.  As other reviewers have said, the beer list does not disappoint. The specials are fairly good and the staff is quite knowledgeable about the brews. The burgers are the best of their food fare and don't get me wrong they are quite delicious, however the rest of the food is standard and unimpressive. If you're going to Hough's, you're usually going for the atmosphere and the brews, not so much to have fantastic food.  On the outside, Hough's doesn't look impressive, but inside it is quite spacious, clean, and has a nice atmosphere. This is one of my favorite bars in the city to watch Penguins games. Added bonus: this bar has a kickin' dartboard machine AND shuffleboard.",

    "text": "This place is great!  Every time I'm in town, I go here for a few beers and a good time.  It's basically the Cheers of Pittsburgh...  This place used to be a really run-down, shady bar that was well-known for the rough characters that would frequent it.  It was shut down by the city (or maybe the previous owners left, who knows) and a new family - The Hough's - opened it back up after major renovations and improvements.  I cannot say enough about the family who runs the place (Barb is amazing, so nice and a great smile!) and the bartenders (Kevin is the man!)  The beer selection is incredible...microbrews, Belgian ales, imports, seasonals, PA craft beers.  Likewise, the specials run every day but Sunday and are great.  They just recently changed their food menu so make sure to take a look at that.  The most I have ever ordered was the grilled cheese sandwich (AMAZING!) which comes with fries, but I have seen more complex dishes that looked rather good for a bar.  Better yet, the prices for food and drinks are all very reasonable, the bathrooms are clean and the place is very comfortable - no more hot, humid bars for me (one of the things I hate the most)!  If you're looking for a friendly, inexpensive and comfortable place to grab a few beers or maybe a bite to eat - this is definitely the place to go!  They even have a board where they post pictures of all the regulars - I mean, how much better can you get?  PS - If you want to play darts, its super cheap, check them out too!",

On the outside Hough's looks like any of the other bars in Greenfield, but as they say don't judge a place by its exterior.   Hough's has 61 beers on tap and about another 100 in bottle selection. Pretty much you can find any type of beer to please any palate. And the beer was pretty cheap, most drafts were below $5! They also serve food. I didn't try any, but from what I saw it looked like decent bar food.  I was surprised by how many people were there on a Monday night. No joke, Hough's was packed. It was tough to find an open bar stool so it makes me wonder how raging the place must be on a weekend. The only downside of the place is how bright the lighting is, I prefer bars to be a little darker, but then again I probably am just being picky. Being a new Greenfield resident I think I am going to spend a lot of time here.",

    "text": "I visited Hough's with two friends for dinner this Sat. at around 7pm.  When they wanted to get together for dinner, I looked through my pack of City Dining Cards, and Hough's stood out for having solid reviews and being close to their place.  I suggested it, and they were game, so we decided to check it out, since none of us had visited previously.  As others have mentioned, they have a legitimately huge beer menu with something for everyone--including non-beer drinkers.  Each of us decided to go with a cider, with two of us trying the Mackenzie black cherry, and the other trying the Magners pear.  I originally wanted to try the Thistly Cross blackberry-pear, but they were out of it, so I tried the black cherry.  It didn't disappoint--it had a deep, rich flavor, and was on the sweeter side, but not overly so (like Woodchuck, etc.).  The price, at $5/bottle, seemed reasonable as well.  For food, two of us ordered the chicken and waffles sandwich ($11), and the other ordered the monte cristo ($11).  The chicken and waffles sandwich is a unique take on this classic brunch dish, and is available at any time at Hough's.  It was extremely filling, but was a bit bland without the syrup.  However, the addition of the syrup solved the blandness issue in short order.  My friend who had the monte cristo said that while it was decent, it was a bit too homogeneously rich and fatty in taste.  Although the menu stated that it had horseradish mayo, which would have cut the richness, she told me she couldn't taste it.  Each of our sandwiches came with a side (we ordered fries, tater tots, and a salad), as well.  Service was a bit on the slow side, but was friendly nonetheless.  At the time of our visit, there were only one or two other tables full, as well as some people at the bar.  Unlike other \"trendier\" bars, there was no loud music, so between that and the sparse crowd, the atmosphere was very conducive to carrying on a conversation, which I appreciated.  Overall, we enjoyed our dinner at Hough's, and would recommend it if you're looking for a low-key bar environment with a great selection of beer and decent food.",

I feel bad for Hough's, I consider them being located in an underappreciated neighborhood that doesn't seem to get much love from the rest of the city.  However we not need worry about Hough's they know how to hold their own, that is for sure.  When you walk in you are greeted by a wide open space that doesn't necessarily feel like a bar.  You do see a great big bar, but that is not all you see.  There are tables throughout the place that lets you know that you don't have to be seated at the bar in order to get service here.  But if you choose to do so, it is a much better experience.  The bartenders are friendly and charismatic.  They greet you with a smile and ask how you are doing before going into their routine of telling you the specials.  They don't mind taking a moment and sit around and chat with you, that is when they aren't busy pouring orders which never seem to stop coming for them.  I only came here to take advantage of the atmosphere and the multitude of beers they have on tap.  I can't talk to the food since I didn't order any type of bites to eat.  But I can guarantee that I will return to try a few of the items on the menu.",

After positioning myself at the end of the bar I could lock in some eye contact with one of them. Ordered drinks and soon snagged up some vacant bar seats to order some food. We asked for the clam dip, but we they were out so we settled for BCD. The chicken was shredded thoroughly and the sauce was creamy. They gave a healthy portion and we asked for more chips.  I had a lagunitas cappuccino stout and then some other stout that I liked way better. (Too bad I'm clumsy and I knocked it over the bar). Was the staff pissed? -yes. Did they say anything rude to me? -no. I leaned over the bar to check out where I spilled and it was the ice chest, left open. My bad.  I plan on going back to try their waffle sandwich and tots. (A type of sandwich I've been enjoying for years) I also want to drink more beer they had! I'll have to plan for a longer visit next time.  Note: At 8:30 I noticed they dim the lights and change the music a bit.",

My husband and I lived in Pittsburgh for 7 years, until last May, and we ate here at least twice a  month, if not once a week, sometimes. We lived within walking distance so that was very nice. The service was always awesome, even when they were slammed. I suggest you sit at the bar if KEVIN is working. He's the best! The wood bar is beautiful and the ambience of the place is fun and hip for many different ages, but not for people looking to have a \"nice, quiet meal.\"   The HUGE beer selection is what really turned us on to this place, we found many new loves here, and you can also get DRAFT beer to go!!   Not just that, we really enjoyed the food, too. The menu changed many times over the years, sadly losing my favorite peanut chicken on lemongrass skewers with an awesome purple cabbage and jicama cole slaw. SO GOOD! At that point in time, they also had a couple different cole slaws you could choose between, I always wished they had a slaw sampler platter as an appetizer. LOL! My hubby was also saddened when they got rid of the build your own hot dog, but hey... They are doing what is best for the establishment and I find it refreshing that they change the menu when they find it necessary.   Anyway, we love the Ruben and the Cuban hoagie. Not to mention the pulled pork nachos and the soup of the day! BRUNCH is also AMAZING! I love the Chicken and waffle sandwich, my hubby loves Hough's Big breakfast, but the Loaded breakfast bowl is also another favorite.   So excited to see that they added some new smoked items like the brisket choices and the seasonal smoked board with assorted meats and cheeses. Can't wait to visit Pittsburgh, this will be the first stop on our list!",

We got the Chicken and Waffles Sandwich and the Roasted Reuben, two things I would highly recommend and get again.  The Reuben meat wasn't shaved but cured and pulled, something I've never experienced on a Reuben and wish they were always like that!  The Chicken and Waffles sandwich was solid also and the spicy syrup dip set it off.  TVs from every angle made sure no matter where I was I had a good view of the game.    For all the highlights I just gave you, they all pale in comparison to the eclectic vast collection of beer.  Ghost Pepper beer, stouts, IPAs, light, heavy you name it they got it.  You can get a 3 beer sampler they offer and try to fit in as many tastes as you can before you inevitably would need carried out.  Some beers boast a whopping 14% alcohol content so the buzz hits quick.    They are supposed to have a different themed nights every night of the week and from what I hear trivia is a must go night, I just might have to.    They had a really cool second bar that I didn't get to sit at and some beers and food I still really wanna try making this place a for sure revisit until I've had my fill.   If you're in the Greenfield area of Pittsburgh I highly recommend this place for dinner and a drink.

The story of that brunch and why we didn't end up actually eating is a long one, but the moral of the story is we arrived at Hough's annoyed, tired and starving.  Being one of the few people in the place we were tended to very quickly by an exceptionally friendly server. He presented mumsie with a glass of champagne in honor of Mother's Day. We ordered corned beef hash and orange zest pancakes, which I swear arrived mere moments after we placed the order.  The food was a solid \"good,\" though nothing insanely amazing.  It was the service that really did it for us.  We were served and outta there well in time for our date at The Escape Room next door.

A lot of people have talked up Hough's, so I was very excited to finally try this establishment.  Since I had already had too many drinks while hanging out at First Friday, I decided to skip the beer and just ordered some appetizers. Our waitress was nice, and made sure to let us know that the kitchen would be closing shortly. We quickly ordered Beer Cheese Nachos with Pulled Pork, Fries, and Cheesecake. When all the food arrived, we immediately dug into the nachos. I took a couple bites and thought, what is that odd flavor? My husband quickly assessed that the chef had not wanted to take the time to properly heat our nachos, and instead melted the cheddar cheese with a butane torch. The cheese had a strong... mmm... gasoline flavor. Disgusting! We mentioned the issue to our waitress, who took 50% off the price of the nachos. In retrospect, we should have demanded the appetizer to be completely removed.  Obviously, the nachos were one of the worse things I've ever eaten. Sadly, the other items did not redeem the nachos either. The fries were limp and cold, while the cheesecake was nice but was obviously not prepared at Hough's.  Outside of the nacho debacle, the beer selection seemed extensive, and I liked the bar's environment. I would be willing to come back... but will never be ordering those nachos again.",

An Actually Amazing Beer Selection-  Most people in Pittsburgh go on about the great selection of beers at bars.  This tends to mean they have Yuengling AND Miller Lite.  I'm not impressed.  But Hough's... OH MAN.  It's a fantastic selection of beers from all over, and they have a nice variety of sizes as well.  So you can get shooter sizes of a variety of beers to sample more than a few!  Awesome.  No smoking- THANK YOU.  Since smelling like an ash tray is such an attractive attribute.  Go Hough's.  Clean-  Yeah.  Bathrooms were clean, floor was clean.  Plates were clean.  Christmas miracle.  Atmosphere- Friendly!  People were ready to chat and have a good time!  I wasn't as impressed with the food as everything else.  I got some kind of beer mac and cheese that was just ok.  Nothing special.  So Hough's can't satisfy my bar food cravings.

    "text": "I could have sworn I wrote a reveiw for Hough's over two years ago, but I guess not. Its probably a good thing because I had been asked to leave once or twice around 8pm (or earlier) because \"it was slow and they were closing early\" and was a little bitter for a while. Good thing I live like a mile away and have been to Hough's maybe 25+ times since then.   Besides the amazing beer selection (200+ bottles and so many on draft), I like Hough's food. Someone who joined me for brunch this morning pointed out \"how nice it is that they have so many vegetarian options for being a bar.\" They have so many good breakfast dishes, most you can sub veggie sausage for, and two breakfast dishes come with VEGETARIAN GRAVY. Holy moly have I missed gravy since giving up most meat, and I am so grateful that Hough's was able to give gravy back to me (meat free). They also have a create your own bloody mary bar with multiple choices of infused vodka to start with. The only time I've been disappointed at breakfast was when I got an eggs benedict type dish and the eggs were cooked all of the way through. They replaced the entree and ended up giving us a discount.  I also recommend their burgers (veggie or otherwise), tater tots, and pretzels.  Hough's is usually a great place to get a beer and some good food, no matter what time of day you head in. The service is generally really good and the place is really bright and clean.",

And then do there darn tootin best to serve you the beer you choose in a glass tumbler bearing the name of said beer.  It's the little things that make places special.

If you can handle the heat, get their spicy burger with a side of tater tots to cool off! The staff always seems to be knowledgeable about the beer/breweries being served to help you find something new to try!

    "text": "Hough's is a family run bar and restaurant with some of the most creative extras in all of Pittsburgh.  For the beer drinker, they have 100s of bottled beers and on the order of 50 on tap at any one time.  They are one of the few bars in the U.S. to have an annex where customers can pay to brew their own recipes.  If you are not a beer drinker, they also have a nice selection of wines and spirits and for people like myself soft drinks.  Free refills on diet cokes  The staff is friendly and caring and take joy in making their establishment a haven for fun events.  Brunch before Steelers games, trivia nights, beer tastings, etc.  add to the attractions here.  With many big screen TVs this is the place to watch a Steelers, Penguins, or Pirates game.   On a sports quiet evening, there is a jukebox for music.  In the warm months Hough's sponsors some outside events which attract many locals and their families. Hough's has an upstairs and downstairs bar with two of the most beautiful wood bar surfaces in Pittsburgh.  The bar decor is eclectic including sports decor, a CMU buggy,  and from time to time books from local authors. The crowd attracted tend to be graduate students, professionals from the universities,  participants in the Pittsburgh Sports League, locals, etc.  They have an excellent bar menu which changes periodically to add variety.  They are not afraid to experiment.  It is therefore fun to come back from a hiatus to see what has evolved.  This is a happening place full of friendly people and trend-setting ideas.  It is a Pittsburgh icon and a must visit.  They get SRO crowds for Pens games and Steelers Sunday's.  Why not become a regular and make some great friends.   My highest recommendation for Hough's.",

    "text": "When we have a group, or at least a picky one (other than me) in the group, we come to Hough's (\"Huff's\", yaknow).  Recently moving to Greenfield, it is literally the only actual place to eat in our little hilltop community. And the crowd is Greenfield--empty nesters, graduate students, young couples--never too crowded unless it's trivia night. And Tuesday trivia night is serious.   I am admittedly not a beer drinker, but I'm serious on some cider. Hough's absolutely has one of the largest bottled cider lists I've seen in the city. McKenzie's cherry is one I haven't been typically able to order in a bar elsewhere, and it is my favorite(!!!!). Obviously the beer lists are even more impressive. The only odd thing from most places I like is the lack of cocktails. That's just not what they do here; it's a neighborhood bar. There was a tiny laminated drink list at one point but I was told it was rubbish, and they didn't have anything that was listed in the drinks. Yikes.  If you have time for food (sometimes it can be a little slow), definitely give it a chance.  Tots! A side of tots is my jam. It's inexpensive, casual, great for weekend lunch. It's a lowkey sports bar without the obnoxiousness. The only downside (other than people bringing their children here), would be the hours. 4 until midnight for a bar/restaurant here is tough. Weekend hours are normal, but scuttling out at 11:30 the rest of the week is a bit annoying.  If you make it to Greenfield for some reason (took the wrong exit off 376?), Hough's is a super casual neighborhood spot worth the stop.",

    "text": "Hough's and I go wayyyy back. I was a Hough's regular when they first opened in 2009 and the facade was a mere random wooden door facing Greenfield Ave...no awning, no indication of any business....just a strange hidden gem full of friendly staff, good food, and more beer options than one can imagine.  Unfortunately, this hidden gem didn't stay hidden forever. The awning went up. People started noticing the little bar on the corner. Suddenly, my usual table on Friday nights was constantly occupied by strangers. Over time, service became unfriendly and inattentive.The food quality worsened. It didn't feel like my homey neighborhood bar anymore. Sadly, Hough's and I broke up.  However, I recently saw my old friend Hough's for the first time in 3 years. While some things have changed (no more shuffleboard?!), I am pleased to report that I had a great experience once again. They've completely revamped their menu and the food was delicious! In particular, the buffalo chicken dip was killer...super sharp, flavorful, and just the right amount of spice. Their smoked chicken wings were pretty fantastic as well. And of course, they still have that gargantuan selection of beers. Most importantly, the service was back to being friendly and welcoming. I also see that they're doing all kinds of cool things now like themed brunches, trivia, etc. My little Hough's is all grown up!  Welcome back to my life, Hough's. I've missed you and I'll definitely be back again!",

Besides having TONS of different drafts, they have a great variety of bottles as well. Their menu is broken up by different categories of beer so it's easy to find what you want. They offer flights and different sized pours so you can sample many different types of beers. They also have great $3 bottle specials. When I was there they had bottles of Flying Dog Bloodline for $3! Great deal!  The food was comparable to most typical bar food. I had a Cajun Burger that was OK.

Browsing the menu, there are burgers, nachos OR Tot-chos  (tots with nacho toppings), even Mac n cheese.  Talk about comfort food!  When my eyes caught the chicken and waffle sandwich, there was no turning back... I was in heaven.  Soft and fluffy waffles embracing the juicy chicken with spicy sauce (perhaps mayo?) with maple syrup on the side to drizzle or dunk you sandwich at your leisure.  Yes, I dunked.  Yes, I wore my maple syrup proudly!  Did I mention this dish came with a side?  When you have chicken and waffles, who needs a side?!  Though I could have selected fries or tots, I opted for the side salad so my full stomach wouldn't inhibit my beer selection.   After cashing out, we went to the Drunkin Pumpkin even.  If you enjoy pumpkin or fall type beers, you must attend this event at least once.  There are 35 beers to sample or just drink your favorites, like Pumking.  At the stroke of midnight (or last call) you will turn into a pumpkin... and you'll be perfectly okay with that.   Thank you Hough's for a great night out with my girls.  I will return soon for more chicken and waffles!  ...what? Don't judge me ;)",

    "text": "My boyfriend took me to brunch last week, refusing to tell me where we were going. The surprise was hough's :). We loved the environment immediately as we walked in! Spacious, tons of TVs and a huge draft list! We went on a Sunday around noon and it wasn't that crowded. We were told to pick any table we wanted, so my boyfriend chose a table with a view of the penguins game, haha.   I knew nothing about this place so I decided to check yelp to see what drink I should order/ what food I should get! I saw that a lot of people raved about their mimosas, so I decided to order one! It was awesome! Blended perfectly, sweet and refreshing flavor and it paired wonderfully with my meal.  The brunch menu is awesome- really unique items like honey nut Cheerios crusted French toast and a chicken and waffle sandwich. They had a separate brunch menu that offered meals and beer pairings! If you order one of those meals, you could keep the mug, pretty cool!   For my main course, I noticed a lot of people raved on yelp about their chicken and waffles. Since I never tried chicken and waffles before, I figured I just had to! Oh.. My.. Goodness! It was insanely good! The chicken and waffles were presented as a sandwich- two fluffy waffles with amazing crispy fried chicken in between. A sweet and spicy sauce was also on the sandwich and syrup to dip! What an awesome sandwich idea for brunch! I was super full after enjoying that! My boyfriend ordered a burger and tots on the side and loved everything , too!   Our server was very friendly and attentive to us throughout our meal. The food came out in a timely manner too :)   We love this place and can't wait to come back to drink some beers and try more of their menu!",

First of all they feature a breakfast flight of select stouts and porters with a coffee for $12. The beers, from Terrapin Brewery's \"Wake & Bake\" collection were delicious!   The bar boasts a large selection of draught craft beer and monthly will rotate a dedicated set of taps to one brewery. They also have numerous TV's and ample seating. The staff was friendly and courteous.   The food was very good. I had a egg sausage and cheese bagel sandwich and the wife had the huevos ranchero. Everything was fresh, warm and delectable.  They also have featured food items such as homemade doughnuts on the brunch menu.  Overall this is a fantastic place just the city. Grab an uber from the downtown district to Greenfield for approx $9-12.",

There are a lot of TVs, so that you can see from any angle-they also had a large projector against one wall, but unfortunately the picture was a bit blurry.    I was really surprised at how large the beer selection was--it was actually a bit overwhelming. They have 2 different bars and the one on the lower level has 3 or 4 rows of taps. The atmosphere is pretty much your typical sports bar, maybe a little bit nicer.  It actually seemed like a big Pittsburgh Sports League hangout by the clientele.",

It's loud, crowded, the waitstaff have pitiful customer service and the food was just sad.   Our order consisted of a plate of nachos with cheese, pico de gallo and green onions and an order of apple pie pierogies with a side of ice cream.  They were out of apple pie pierogies, and the waitress didn't ask if I wanted  something else, before leaving.  The nachos arrived, the cheese was like cheese sauce, but cold. The \"pico de gallo\" was basically diced tomatoes and a couple of chives.  It was dry, bland and boring.    Hough's, you've done better.  You've been going downhill for a long time, and this is the last time my fanny will grace one of your seats.  We've tried and tried to give you a chance to redeem yourselves, and we keep getting disappointed.",

Their food is tremendous and there is so many different kinds of craft beer it will make your head spin! My guess is there is about 70 beers on draft and another 100-150 bottles to choose from. The food is out of this world. I have eaten here four times and it has never let me down. My wife and I ordered the nachos as an appetizer, the Rachel sandwich, and garlic Parmesan wings. Everything was delicious. This is my favorite place in Allegheny County by far! I can't wait to go back.",

It feels like it was a bar once, then they crammed tables in everywhere so that you're going up stairs, down stairs, around other tables, and watch out for dead ends. I was only here 2 weeks ago and it took awhile staring at the menu to remember what I even had. It was chicken and waffles. They were actually quite good, although whatever syrup they give you to pour over it is not maple or even fake maple. It tasted like sugar. Cane syrup? Couldn't complain about the chicken at all, and the waffle held up to it. There were plenty of fries, to where I'm glad I didn't try the poutine appetizer. That would have been overload and likely disappointment - good poutine is found only in Canada or the Canadian parts of NY/New England. You tell me, other reviewers? Wish I could remember the beer I ordered also, since they don't list their tap rotation on the website. I remember it being a little short on the darker beers (though it was summer to be fair), but I found something I liked in the end. Service was good but I think one person's dish took awhile to come out compared to the rest of us. May have even been mine. Verdict: A neighborhood bar that outgrew itself without finding more space. 3.5 stars, rounding up for not remembering enough negatives to take a deduction.",

The last couple times we've gone I've come away less likely to return. After this last visit I think we're done.   Saturday night around 6pm and an empty restaurant when it was once bustling at this time is probably a sign others feel the same way. We were brought a pitcher of water that had a strong taste of soap. Food took over a half hour and when it came out my grilled chicken was half the size of my bun.  The manager/owner walked by numerous times. Never said a word, no apology.   Overall the place could use some tlc. It's disappointing seeing it fall off after 10 years of dining here.",

They usually have a good selection of beers on tap and bottled.  They also run some great beer specials at times.  On my most recent trip they had a pumpkin ipa on special for $3 which is something you don't see at other places.  Onto the food.  Hough's menu used to consist of several different burgers, all of which were delicious.  However they have recently overhauled their menu, making it significantly more limited.  There is only one burger on the menu now.  I have not had it yet so I cannot speak to that.  On my last trip to Hough's my group all had different types of wings with sides of fries.  First, both the fries and the wings came out almost cold.  Second, they forgot several orders of fries.  The tastes of the various wings were very average, as was their ranch.  On my previous trip I had their pierogies.  These are by far the best option currently on the menu.  I had the bacon jalapeno pierogies and they were delicious.    I will definitely be back to Hough's, but I wish they would step up their overall food game to where it used to be.",

    "text": "Stopped by here today for my friend's 22nd birthday and it was a blast! We came during happy hour and there were a ton of drafts for $4. I mean a ton! There are so many options and they were so delicious. Personally, I stuck with the Rhinegeist Moose and I loved it a lot.  They also have a $5 cheeseburger special during happy hour apparently so a few of us at our table got that too. A basket of fries was an extra $3 but it was a decent amount of fries. It's just a regular plain cheeseburger with onion, lettuce, and tomatoes. It was tasty, small, but tasty.  Service was really nice and friendly. Our waitress was really accommodating and happily grabbed us a lighter for our birthday candles and even offered to bring us extra plates (but I had brought the plates and utensils). I would love to come here again and try some of the other food on their menu because they sounded delicious! I really enjoyed my time here and the atmosphere was super chill and fun.",

The waiter explained that this special of the night  has lettuce, cheese, boneless chicken wings, covered with buffalo chicken dip, all in a waffle bowl. When the appetizer was brought to us, we realized the boneless chicken wings were basically breaded chicken nuggets with no sauce of any type on them, there was a small amount of buffalo chicken dip on top, and the bowl was pretty small for an item that was meant to be shared. The flavor of the dish was good, but didn't wow me as I hoped. A few of our other friends ordered the jumbo wings and they were great, and the dish was definitely large enough to share. Their beer selection was awesome and had a nice variety. Service here was also very nice and accommodating to our large group.",

The meal I remember the most here was the msot recent and my favorite, the totchos. These are exactly what you'd think they are, similar to nachos, but with tator tots instead. We added pulled pork onto these, and they were outstanding. Perfect food to start us off for a night of drinking. They carry a solid beer list, always having a good variety of craft brews. Not just a craft beer bar, as there are usually good deals on domestics. When we were here it was $2 for a 20oz Molson, can't beat a deal like that. This is a pretty standard sports bar/pub, but you will not be disappointed. Typical bar food, but way better than your local corner bar. Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area.",

BUT, and this is the reason I will go elsewhere next time...the overpriced food sucks and at least some of the waitstaff/management is sub-par.  I went early Sat. evening and got wings--garlic parm, greasy and tasteless.  Comes with 2--yes 2 celery pieces, and if u comment on that you will get 2 more pieces, ungraciously handed to you by a surly waiter who looked like he wanted to be anywhere but taking care of customers.  I don't think he smiled once the whole time I was there.  THEN....my meatball sub comes..3 tiny meatballs on a HALF of a hot dog--yes, not hoagie roll but a hot dog bun!  It looked like a kids meal!  Seriously, Subway's $5 footlong is a great deal compared to this!   At least I've never had bad service at Subway!  The manager( ?) came over and said, \"I'm sorry you're not having a good time.\"  Well, to be honest, I was having a fine time, just terrible food!   When I pointed out the measly meatball sub, adding that the beer is great, but the food is less than, she said something like, \"well yeah we are known for our beers, the kitchen is kinda secondary.\"  Ok then maybe you should charge alot less for your kinda secondary food!   Better yet, give it away! To add insult to injury, the bill comes, and instead of comping the sub, like a normal place would do (I took one bite!) they took 1/2 off.  I mean come on...do you want your 3.50 or do you want a satisfied customer who will come back and tell others how the management took good care of you?  So again I called the manager over, again she states (extremely passive aggressive, this one!), \"I'm sorry you're not having a good time.\"  AGAIN, I'm not NOT having a good time, but this is ridiculous.  I didn't eat the sub, what I tasted was terrible, and it's obvious the food is not important here.   She ungraciously agreed to take off the 3.50 and she hopes we will try Hough's again.  Uh, I don't think so, not unless it's JUST for the beer.  But there are plenty of other places in Pittsburgh for great beer and bar food, and nice staff.  It's a shame, because I like to see local places make it, but I don't think you can do that with the kind of food and service I experienced.   Maybe it was an off night, but they were't too busy, it was about 6pm when we got there.  AND this is the second time I've been there, was actually giving it a second try after the first visit a couple of months ago where the small portions of appetizers were greasy and tasteless.  SO..there won't be a third strike!   If they make it on their beers, great, but I won't be supporting them anymore.  Shame.",

    "text": "I went here last Friday night as bunch of my friends wanted to hang out and partake in their special of the evening: $3 seasonal beers!  Their selection of beer is outstanding, their website says they have over 220 bottled beers and boy I believe it; the list was 4 pages long.  I also just learned from their website that they have on draft Miller Lite, Yuengling and Guinness along with 5 other seasonal brews.  They also serve cocktails, but I didn't have one so I can't comment on them.  When my husband and I arrived we each thought that we had interrupted a private party but we found our friends in the back corner and quickly joined them.  We didn't have enough seats for everyone and one of the servers was kind enough to bring us an extra chair.    We decided to order some food and I got the \"Traditional Burger\" for 4.99 and my husband got the \"Benko Burger\" for I think was 6.99,  each came with a side of fries or chips.   Our burgers were super dry (read: WELL done) but he couldn't really tell because his burger was covered in cheese and special chipotle sauce.  The chips where thick, hot, oily and salty and the fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Service was slow but hey, it was a busy Friday night.  The entire time we were there I couldn't relax because the lights were so bright!  I like my bars to have lighting so low if I drop something on the ground I won't be able to find.  Here, however, I was able to see everything in stark detail: the pristine wood floors, the shiny new bar, a noticeable lack of windows--which I normally wouldn't care about because I wouldn't be able to *see* them--and it gave me the feeling that I was in someone's bonus rooms.  You know, the room middle-aged men with too much money get to add onto their houses and pretend they have a bar by putting up neons, a projector with \"the game\" on, and a shuffle board off to the side.  I recommend this place if you want to have access to a large selection of beers and don't care about ambiance and have already eaten dinner.  Oh, and they just started having brunch on Sunday's 10am-2pm.  Mimosas will be served.",

    "text": "Wonderful place! Bright, clean, and friendly atmosphere with televisions for sports. The two bartenders serving my husband and me this past Saturday were extremely friendly and very knowledgable about both beer and food. I loved that each beer had a sample size so you could try a variety without getting stuck with any beer you already know you dislike. I found a few beers I will definitely order in the future and am looking forward to sampling another 5 the next time I'm in. The bartender recommended getting anything with the pulled pork and I have to agree it was outstanding! My husband and I ordered the nachos with pork as an appetizer and ended up making it our meal after we saw its size. We even left some chips/cheese/tomatoes on the plate but every single scrap of the pork was gobbled up. There is a pulled pork sandwich on the menu too and I may try it next time. This place is a real gem. Go check it out!",

    "text": "We ventured here on a Saturday night as I was given a gift card from a friend. I warned my boyfriend that the drinks are great but the food may not be as good. Boy was I wrong. I had not been to Hough's in over 4 years and they changed their menu since my last visit. Not a ton of options but the design of the menu looks great. I went with a burger which came with blue cheese, onions and bacon plus a choice of a side. You could choose from fries, tater tots, or a salad. I went with a salad with honey mustard. Everything tasted delicious and the burger was cooked to perfection with lots of toppings. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles with tater tots. He loved it and it did look tasty. Of course the beer is the best part as they have tons of draft and bottle beer. What I love best is that you can get 4.7 oz pours which is perfect for me who likes to try a number of different beers. I got 4 samples all ranging from $2-$3 including a delicious sour beer. It was darker than the normal sour beers that I have tried before but I still really liked it. Also liked the Shiner Strawberry I sampled. Overall we had a fun date night, fine service and I want to go back to sample more beer!",

    "text": "Great selection of beer. That's a good start, although they were out of Flower Power IPA but found a nice surprise in a Copper Kettle dark IPA made right in their own brewery.  It was fifty cent wing night and good friend of Joe, Ross, was eagerly waiting to order his garlic wings. I looked over the menu and saw a build your own burger menu. Two vegan options, portobello mushrooms and a veggie patty. They also had beef, bison and another offering that I can't remember. All build your own burgers start at 7 bucks except the bison which is 9. Add ons are extra, cheese is 75 cents or a buck, veggies are 50 cents each, sauces are 50 cents, I'm sure it adds up and your burger could be 14 bucks if you go overboard. I decided on the hummus.   I got a huge bowl, complete with carrot sticks, celery, and pita, not baked though, soft and fresh. Unfortunately, the hummus was rather unremarkable, bland, and could have been made better with some garlic, some herbs, or even a bit of salt and pepper. I looked on the bar for salt shakers, or a bottle of tabasco, but none were to be found. Which is a shame, with all the cooking shows on TV that the cooks here can't properly season a dish.  Next time i'll build a burger and see what happens. Ross loved the six wings and devoured them with a Sam Adams Oktoberfest.   Hough's seems more like an Elk's lodge or Eagle's club. There's room for improvement, and I hope the cook finds the salt shaker.",

I've been there on various game days when it was inexplicably empty. Lots of wood-panelling and you're never unable to see the many flat screens mounted around the restaurant. Patrons do get nice and loud when the Steelers are playing.  Hough's calling-card is their huge selection of beer. Lots of beers on tap and you can get small samples to see which you like better. The food is standard American bar food - chicken fingers, fries, nachos, etc. The service is friendly and if anything gets messed up (hey, no one's perfect), they're quick to try to correct the mistake.",

Most recently I was asked to move my seat after my food order came. I obiliged thinking that I was doing something nice for a fellow patron but came to realize that I was being relocated so that servers who were off for the day could sit there. If there isn't a seat at the bar then sit your ass down at one of the many empty tables and don't bother your customers. I don't know what happened to all the nice guys that used to tend bar but I'm done with the surly attitude from the ladies that have been working there the last few months. Two stars because they still have a killer beer selection and I'm not a monster.",

The food there is basic pub fare and not great.  We tried the roasted Brussels sprouts app which was pretty terrible.  A great idea but poor execution at best.  The nachos were ok nachos.  Stick to the simple pub stuff if you eat here.    If you came to drink the beer you are at the right place!  Very wide selection of brews for all palates and pretty extensive draft list.

    "text": "Hough's is a salvation for anyone living in the lovely, but otherwise bar-devoid neighborhood of Greenfield. Lots and lots of beer, both in bottles and draft form. The beer list reads like a novel, with brewery, beer genre, standard price, growler price, and last but not least ABV conveniently listed for every option. The food is generally fantastic bar food. I particularly recommend any of the burgers or wings. You will order your wings, and then you might find yourself grumbling about why it hasn't come out yet. SETTLE DOWN, GRUMPYPANTS. It is taking a little longer because they're making them FRESH, and the extra care shows after they hit your lips.   During the week the place is almost exclusively populated by PSL athletes coming from their games at nearby Magee Field. On the weekends you have a fun-loving crowd ranging from 21 to 99. Shuffleboard. Closed on Sunday unless the Steelers are playing.  Only grievance is that the TV's aren't wonderfully situated for obsessive sports watching. On either side of the bar, the TV's are on the opposite walls, at a very low angle so often times you're watching the bartenders instead of the game. Best solution is to come with a group of friends, get a table, and passively watch the game on the projection in the corner.",

It's close to where I live, and is generally a quite fun place (lots of events, including trivia night, drunkin pumpkins and such). We love to invite our friends and hang out, and the bartenders are generally decent.  All I have to say  is be weary of their specials.The first time I figured it was a mistake and let it slide. However the second time I found a mistake by them it  annoyed me enough that I wanted to create a yelp account to post about it. Twice now I've been burned by their 4 dollar happy hour. I've got a couple drinks, and then when I get my bill I notice some of them are full price. Upon letting the bartender know this last time about it the response I got was, \"oh yeah some high alcohol beers aren't subject to happy hour prices, I did notice one beer is 1/2 off that shouldn't be.. how about I just look the other way for that?\". Um what? I looked at the menu and there was no indication of any special pricing, nor did the bartenders ever say anything.   Lame. For advertising themselves as a neighborhood bar, they sure are seeming less and less friendly.",

So there is something good that came out of this Snowmageddon of 2010, at least for me ;)  I was impressed by the huge beer selection they have, there are a few taps (5 or 6) and 3 huge fridges with bottled stuff at the end of the bar. Unlike some other places I've been to, here they print all the bottled beers in a menu; so it's easy to see what they have and made your pick. I've also tried an appetizer here, fried pirogies with sour cream, they were tasty but that's as far as I made it into the food menu (they do offer lunch, dunner and even brunch now)  They also have darts and shuffleboard, and a big TV to watch Lakers games on. And if that's not enough, Fridays are $4 margaritas and they are huge. This Saturday they had a 21A beer tasting, Rogue tasting earlier this year. All in all, pretty amazing for a bar so close to home and the prices are obviously lower than Southside (and the crowd a ton more bearable)",

Several TV's and a giant wall projector PLUS they turn the sound on for the game! Woot! Maybe it was just because we were playing the Flyers, but everyone in Hough's was cheering and into the game which made the atmosphere awesome.  On to the important things...  Ridiculously awesome beer selection -- 50-60 on tap and hundreds of bottles which was, at first, quite overwhelming (oh the decision making!!) but I'm certainly not complaining.  I think this was just a fluke, but the taps weren't working on the first 2 beers my boyfriend ordered and on one of the beers our friend ordered. With so many choices it wasn't really a problem, but certainly worth noting.    Apps:: We started with Buffalo Chicken Dip which was A-mazing but I do wish the quality of the tortilla chips were a bit better... Seriously, not a big deal though. The dip more than made up for it.  We also ordered the Mac 'n Cheese Bites. They were okay...   Entree:: I had the Chicken Cheesesteak with coleslaw as a side. Awesome, super delicious. I may have wolfed it in down in like 3 minutes... it happens. The chicken was sliced thin and all the cheese was nice and melted to perfection. Boyfriend had Benko Burger which he really enjoyed. The quality of the meat was great, very juicy and cooked just how he liked. The toppings were great as well. Fries were standard but yummy. Chipotle wings received a really good review as did another burger... I cannot remember for the life of me what specific type of burger our friend ordered but I do recall him saying it was really good.   Overall, we will certainly be back to watch some Playoff Hockey and indulged in delicious food and beers very soon!",

Never have I been disappointed by the variety at Hough's.  This is a bar first, and a restaurant second. They keep the taps clean, and as a result nowhere does beer taste this good. The food is still fantastic though. A few highlights are the reuben, pulled pork, and tatchos, though many others have not disappointed me.   Without a doubt I recommend Hough's to anyone that passes through Greenfield. With a welcoming, knowledgeable staff, and a beer selection to rival all (difficult to do even in Pittsburgh) Hough's manages to have the atmosphere of a neighborhood bar where a beer connoisseur feels welcome.",

I had the grilled cheese with apple sauce (although she brought me coleslaw instead but then righted this almost immediately), good, but not great.  We had the zucchini planks (good), Chicken tenders (decent) with BBQ sauce (NOT GOOD at all), homemade chips (too well done/hard for how thick they were cut), and I am not certain of what my husband had... think a chicken sandwich.  If it was anything great, I would remember it.    This is a great place to go watch a game, have a few drinks with friends... but not the best.",

My wife wrote all about it in her review so I won't go into great detail but we got a bad plate of nachos that were pretty much inedible.   Other than the disappointment over the Nachos the Beer select was awesome and they seems to have a nice well rounded selection. I settled in with a Left Hand Milk Stout which is always a good choice. They also have table top shuffle board which I didn't get a chance to play when I visited but I'm sure is also fun.   If you are in the Neighborhood and find yourself craving a Beer give this place a go. Maybe pass on the Cheese Nachos, especially if it's close to kitchen closing time.",

Most of the bartenders have a genuine passion for craft beer and, thus, have a deep knowledge on the subject. They are clutch when you are indecisive on what beer to pick (just one look at the beer menu and you will see how easy that is).  I love the beer, staff, and atmosphere; however, i withheld a star becuase of food.  The burgers, wings, and other items are solid, but the menu items overall will never have you raving about them. I have also gone to their sunday brunch a few times, which everything tasted great and was very reasonably priced. I would recommend going to try the brunch at least once.  Take your growlers on monday and get 5 bucks off your refill!",

Then, one day, you throw caution to the wind, and walk in. As a serious, collegiate beer drinker, you immediately fall in love. All you've wanted in a bar is here. A single tear falls to the floor.    How could I list all the things I love? I will pare it down to 10.  First of all, it's family run, and they family is full of nice people. I mean, who wants to frequent an establishment run by a family full of jerks? Not me. They always swing by to chat me and hubby up, by name. Secondly, there is a wall of taps. Third, they have great prices, and there's always a special going on. Fourth, no smoke! Fifth, a wall of taps, Sixth, they have TVs with sports, but I wouldn't call it a \"sports bar.\" Seventh, the interior is nice, and not at all cheap or worn-down. Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth (drum roll) wall o' taps!!",

I had the soft pretzel sticks, which were very moist and flavorful, and the Reuben. Other menu items include haluski, a pittsburgh classic, and all kinds of burgers.

Unfortunately, we forgot it was game 7 for the Pens Stanley Cup playoffs so the place was packed. We stood at the door waiting to get seated. Since we had never been there before we did not know the routine. There were no signs saying please wait to be seated or please seat yourself. So we waited a bit in the meantime two or three servers both male and female both walked passed us never saying a word or acknowledging our presence . My fiance attempted to get the attention of one of the waiters but she brushed on by like he didn't exist. I thought my fiance was going to explode so we left.   I am willing to give the place the benefit of the doubt. Frankly, it was a busy evening. We will attempt to go back on a night there is no game or event. I have heard great things about the beer selection at this place. I hope next time it doesn't disappoint!!!",

    "text": "We love Hough's.  Huge beer selection, with frequent specials (although sometimes I find myself surprised that they can have such a huge selection with so few beers that I would call \"really good\").  The food is pretty good, with a tasty veggie burger on the menu.  The prices aren't great but they aren't too exorbitant.  Tuesday night bar trivia is a lot of fun if you get a good group together.  Also?  Non-smoking, which I love.  It shouldn't be a bonus to get to leave a bar not stinking like a chimney, but sadly in PGH it is.  Probably the best thing about this place is its general neighborhood feeling - like everyone is a regular.  The worst thing, though, is the neighborhood it's in!  Not that we don't like Greenfield, it's just that it's so far away from everything.  Getting home via bus usually means either a very long walk followed by a very long ride that winds all over the city, or else leaving by 9 or 9:30 to catch the better routes.  We have a car, but generally don't want to go to a bar and then drive home.  So I guess that could be consTrued as either a complaint about location, or a complaint about the Allegheny County Port Authority routes!  Either way, we do try to come back, but we don't get there as often as we'd like.",

The servers were attentive and made a nice first impression.  There is at least one TV if not two on every wall, so Hough's is def. a place to catch a sporting event.  Do I recommend making a special trip to Hough's for beer?  No, but if you happen to be in Greenfield or want to chill out somewhere enjoying a wide selection of beers while watching a game, def. stop by for a few brews.",

I'm lucky that my kickball nights line up with flight nights.    Hough's is also part of a small brewery (Copper Kettle Pgh), offering burghers some amazing local offerings.  My favorite is the Cuckoo Clock IPA.  It's a perfect balance of hoppy bitterness, malt, and has a high abv kick to finish. I wish they offered it all year round! (Ahem... wink wink nudge nudge, Copper Kettle PGH!)    After a game, my team typically gets a few appetizers with our beers, and Hough's has a large amount of decently priced apps to accommodate. Their buffalo chicken dip is one of the best (although I've had better spinach dips elsewhere), and their large nachos with chicken can feed a few of our hungry players post-win.    Boyfriend and I have also gone to Hough's for a few weekday dinners, taking advantage of their 4-6pm happy hour.  Drafts are half off, and apps/well drinks are a dollar off. Not bad!    If you look at their online or in-house chalkboard calendar, there is always something going on.  Trivia, flight nights, gameday specials, you name it.    I would happily give Hough's a five-star review if it weren't for ONE thing... their burgers.  And by that I mean the beef, as the crab cake and Portobello \"burgers\" have always been just fine.  The beef that they use is very low quality... it reminds me of the cheap patties they served at lunch in high school.  I'm sorry, but at around ~$10 including toppings, they really need to kick up the quality of their meat.   But that's really the only problem I have with this otherwise fantastic place!",
