    "text": "UPDATE:  I was not able to log in to YELP so I had to create a new account.  Here is my candid, honest UPDATED Casa Nayarit review:  The most accurate way to describe Casa Nayarit is a somewhat authentic Mexican restaurant which takes many liberties with the Pittsburgh palate.  Judging from their True Mexican dishes Casa Nayarit deserves at least 3 stars, however, the noticeably compromised menu with many mild, bland dishes drops their authenticity and limits their overall rating in my mind.    The legitimate authenticity in part:  decor, price point, their salsas (tomatillo is roasted and very, very good though their roja is way too mild - catering to the area), dishes such as bistec a la mexicana, tampiquena, molcajete, camerones diablo, carnitas verde, carnitas ranchero, carne asada, enchiladas verde, tacos de pescada, huevos a la mexicana, & the friendly native language Spanish employees and more.  The standard Americanized liberties:  flour tortillas as the default option, giant burritos (burritos are not a True Mexican dish but places like Juarez will serve a version due to the blurring Tex Mex lines in Northern Mexico), hard shell tacos, no lime wedges, lettuce and cheese as taco toppings (that is a BIG no-no, they should at least give customers a Mexican option with cilantro, onion and radish), no Jarritos, cheese smothered over a lot of their food,  tortillas with melted cheese dip, as well as some other things on their menu.    All in all, Casa Nayarit is a mid-Atlantic Mexican restaurant who must make financial ends meet hence the mostly understandable decisions to cater to all clientele.  They USED to do a very good job, mostly, in using fresh, quality ingredients while trying to balance some of their root cuisine with a heavy Tex-Mex influence and food American palates are accustom to eating. HOWEVER, as of late their food has been substandard taking MANY short cuts.  Also, their food's flavors are firmly on the mild side.  I have been a customer around 30 times and ordered a large part of their menu. I USED to leave pleased with taste of their dishes much more often than not though they are much, much more hit and miss (mostly miss) now. I still wish they would add more spice to some of their traditional, genuine Mexican dishes. Having written that, they do have more than their share of the Hispanic community who eat in their restaurant.  That community seems to order a Molcajete.  It is an amazingly tasty, super flavorful, unique dish made in their own certain way served in a traditional molcajete.  Its almost a cross between Texas fajitas and Mexico City's tampiquena.  For the most part, if you want AUTHENTIC, KNOW what you are ordering, and are very specific you may be pleased. If you think you know authentic and order chips with cheese or a fajita burrito you will still be happy because the quality for that kind of palate is generally pretty good. If you just want Americanized Mexican they have a BIG place on the menu for you too. This is a nice, semi authentic restaurant (but please add soft corn tortillas as standard) on the verge of taking too many Tex Mex chances which distance themselves from their True Mexican roots.  Food comparable to:  El Campesino but somehow with a more home style yet less authentic feel. Recommended but YMMV.",

    "text": "Small unpretentious restaurants always seem to deliver - and Casa Nayarit did!!  We munched heartily on the crisp hearty chips and the smooth flavorful salsa while looking over their very diverse menu. There's fajitas, seafood, carne asada, carnitas, and combination plates galore. I had the carne asada with a side of chili rellenos!!! LOVED the chili rellenos!!! So good that I ordered 3 to go!!! The carne asada was good - but just wasn't as flavorful as others I've enjoyed- and missing grill marks too. The guacamole was good as were the beef tacos and enchiladas. We brought with us our own margaritas and really enjoyed our meal!! Service was great and very attentive. Loved the typical low key atmosphere with serapes and sombreros on the wall- delighted too with a large picture window in the back letting in natural light. The bench seats were very comfortable and not worn out as many are. I was delighted when I got home and in my bag with my chili rellenos was a bag of chips, a small container of salsa and extra sauce for my rellenos!!! The extra sauce seemed spicier than what was on the one I had with dinner - a great surprise!! We'll be back!! Just wish it were closer to us!!!",

    "text": "The most accurate way to describe Casa Nayarit is a somewhat authentic Mexican restaurant which takes many liberties with the Pittsburgh palate.  Judging from their True Mexican dishes Casa Nayarit deserves more than 3 stars, however, the compromised menu drops their authenticity and limits their overall rating in my mind.    Here is my candid review:    The legitimate authenticity in part:  decor, price point, their salsas (tomatillo is roasted and amazing though their roja is way too mild - catering to the area), dishes such as bistec a la mexicana, ttampiquena, molcajete, camerones diablo, carnitas verde, carnitas ranchero, carne asada, enchiladas verde, tacos de pescada, huevos a la mexicana, & the friendly native language Spanish employees and more. I wonder why they do not serve mole other than perhaps the chefs are not from Oaxaca (hence the Nayarit name) and they don't want to sell the amazing sauce short of its True glory.   The standard Americanized liberties:  flour tortillas as the default option, giant burritos (burritos are not a True Mexican dish but places like Juarez and Sinoloa will serve a version due to the blurring Tex Mex lines in Northern Mexico), hard shell tacos, having to ask for lime wedges, lettuce and cheese as taco toppings (that is a BIG no-no, they should at least give customers a Mexican option with cilantro, onion and tomatillo sauce), no Jarritos, cheese smothered refried beans rather than True black or pinto beans, tortillas with melted cheese dip, as well as some other things on their menu.    All in all, Casa Nayarit is a mid-Atlantic Mexican restaurant who must make financial ends meet hence the mostly understandable decisions to cater to all clientele.  They do a very good job, mostly, in using fresh, quality ingredients while trying to balance some of their root cuisine with a heavy Tex-Mex influence and food American palates are accustom to eating.  Their quality of food has always been excellent even when some of the flavors have been on the mild side.  I have been a customer around 30 times and ordered a large part of their menu. I have left pleased with taste of their dishes much more often than not. I wish they would add more spice to some of their traditional, authentic, genuine Mexican dishes, though. Having written that, they do have more than their share of the Hispanic community who eat in their restaurant.  That community seems to order a Molcajete.  It is an amazingly tasty, super flavorful, unique dish made in their own certain way served in a traditional molcajete.  For the most part, if you want AUTHENTIC, KNOW what you are ordering, and are very specific you can be very pleased. If you think you know authentic and order chips with cheese or a fajita burrito you will still be happy because the quality will be good. If you just want Americanized Mexican they have a place on the menu for you too. This is a nice, semi authentic restaurant (but please add soft corn tortillas as standard) on the verge of taking too many Tex Mex chances which distance themselves from their True Mexican roots.   Food comparable to:  El Campesino with a more home style but less authentic feel. Recommended but YMMV.",

My wife ordered take out from here the other night, which included her normal vegetarian burrito.  We picked the meal up, got home, and were ready to eat...only her burrito was not vegetarian.  She called Casa Nayarit to inform them of the mistake and ensure the right order was ready when she returned.  The person who answered the phone's response was that my wife was wrong and she did not order a vegetarian burrito.  My wife has been a vegetarian for over 25 years, she does not accidentally order meat...which she explained...the person on the phone responded that she was lying and if she wanted a vegetarian burrito, she would have to pay for it...again.  It's a shame, because this place was pretty good when they first opened and we enjoyed eating there, never again.  In short, terrible service, will never eat here again.",

    "text": "Five stars HAPPY!!!!!   Having just returned from the State of Nayarit, Mexico, I was delighted when a friend here in Pittsburgh told me of Casa Nayarit.  I couldn't wait to give it a try. In three words, I loved it. I walked in and asked the waiter in Spanish if he was from Tepic, capital of Nayarit state. He smiled and said he was from near there. I sat down, satisfied that Nayarit  was not just a named picked out of the air.   The ambience felt very authentic, with Mexican channels showing futbol (soccer) on two flat screen TV's (in separate sections of the rather small restaurant.) Mexican prints are on the wall. Lots of Mexican restaurants look like a movie set of what Mexico is thought to look like. Casa Nayarit looks like a restaurant in Mexico that caters to locals.   Started with chips and salsa. The homemade corn chips were excellent,  (as were the tortillas with my main course, which I suspect were also homemade, though I forgot to ask.)  The sauce was not great but there were bottles of two different hot sauces on the table which took care of the situation just fine.   For a main course I ordered shrimp with onion and green pepper. The shrimp were cooked to perfection. The vegetables were al dente and tasty. The dish came with rice and beans that were also delicious. I was reminded of the lunch I thoroughly enjoyed in Tepic, Nayarit, on May 1. I had no room for dessert so I can't help you there. I left totally happy and will return soon.  Please note that the only signage faces the side street from which there is no access to the restaurant. If you approach on South Park Road, it's the red building set back from a parking lot. ALSO NOTE THAT THE RESTAURANT IS CLOSED ON MONDAY, something I found out the hard way. As other reviewers have noted, it's BYOB, no license at least for now.   I get the sense that every dish will be as great as the shrimp dish I had, and I can't wait to go back.",

It's our thing. So of course I have been searching a place close by that we can check out. Lo and behold, we found one of Bethel Parks hidden gems, Casa Nayarit.  Casa Nayarit lies tucked away on South Park Road in an inconspicuous little building which I'm pretty sure used to be some sort of rec center. As someone who has enjoyed Mexican cuisine so authentic it was literally in Mexico, this is authentic and absolutely delicious. I got chile rellenos, beans and rice. If you don't know what a chile relleno is, its basically a baked pepper stuffed with queso and smothered in sauce. They were so good! The only negative thing about this place is that they don't have their liquor license yet (soon!), but it is BYOB! I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Mexican food.",

    "text": "I badly wanted to love it here. Bethel park doesn't have a single good restaurant, let alone Mexican food.  Pros: I ordered the special texas. The chimichanga was good. But the quesadilla was sitting in a pool of watery green liquid that completely ruined it, and turned the tortilla into a mass of goo. Blah! Otherwise, it would've been pretty decent.   The chips and salsa were standard, nothing special.   Someone ordered fatitas. They give an enormous skillet of meat. Easily enough for 3 (or two very large appetite portions).   The kids menu is the best bargain. $3.99 gets you a taco, quesadilla, and fries. Not bad. The 3 year old ate more than I did.   The prices are decent. 6 adults and a child for around $90.00.   Cons: they're not set up to handle more than one party bigger than 4. It's almost all 4 person booths.  The mess under our booth was...disturbing. I won't post the picture, but trust me when I tell you to keep your eyes above the table. I'm still not sure what I saw...but I'm hoping it was a piece of beef, and not what it looked like...  3 people out of 6 were not feeling well in the middle of the night.  It'll be quite a while before I crave Mexican food again.  :(",

    "text": "Oh how the mighty have fallen!  We've been coming here since the place opened a year and half or so ago.  Maybe it's been a little longer.    We went this evening, May 4, 2016 and were happy to see a mostly full restaurant.  We ordered our usual queso dip and \"Fajitas Valarta\" for 2.  The first sign something was a little off was the queso.   I commented that it was runny.  Ok, maybe it's just the way the batch was made, move on, right?  Next the fajitas for 2 came out sizzling just like it always does.  This time however, the plate featured LOTS of peppers and onions sizzling and little else.  There were 5 or so shrimp, like always, but very little in the way of beef or chicken.  Very little.    I actually called the waiter over and asked if this is how the dish is made now.  He said that they have cut the portions but it did seem small.  He took it to the kitchen and was quickly turned around.  He apologized and said that this is how the dish is now served.  We said ok and just stared at it - stuck in that moment where you decide if you're going to take one for the team and eat or roll.  We decided we'd eat and just not return, lesson learned.  However, as I sat there for another minute or two I was so disgusted that I decided to portion out the chicken and beef.  In doing so we determined we had about 2oz of chicken and maybe 2 oz of beef to go with our 5 shrimp.  This is for a \"fajitas for 2\" combo, mind you.  I should have taken a picture of the beef and chicken separated out but the waiter took it back before I thought to do it.  He again apologized and we politely told him we wouldn't be back if this is the new reality.  I'm thinking that without the revenue a liquor license would generate that the Casa can't make the margins they need to survive.  It's a pity because it was previously a nice place considering the quality of the food and portions.  Take that away though and you have just another restaurant operator trying to pull the wool over your eyes.  Hasta La Vista, Casa Nayarit.",

I had the Pollo Adobe which is a thin but large chicken breast under a wonderful mixture of spinach, green bell pepper, mushrooms, tomatos, and probably other good veggies.  It also comes with rice (very good!) and beans. On another plate you get three hot flour tortillas wrapped in foil.  Now, I am not sure if I should eat the tortillas fajita-style by putting my dinner into the tortilla or eat the tortilla separately the way you would eat garlic bread with spaghetti.  So I did both! (As a kid in So Cal, we would eat the hot tortillas with butter before the meal came, the way we have chips and salsa before the meal nowadays.)  Regardless of how I should eat it, it tasted great and I left nothing on my plate. Looking forward to next time!!  One thing to note: this place is byob.",

    "text": "The hubs and I were in the area to see about a tire pressure issue with the Mini. We were going to go to two nearby Consignment furniture stores afterwards but I started feeling a rumbling in my tummy and knew I needed to eat before checking out the furniture stores. We went on YELP and this restaurant came up. It was literally 2 minutes from where we were.  We saw the sign but then saw the building. The sign said OPEN but it didn't look like it. My husband tried the door and it opened so he went in. There was a second set of doors. You still are feeling a little iffy but once you open the second door you see the signs of a Mexican restaurant-sombreros.  We were seated quickly. The place was about half full. The menu offered over 20 Lunch options. While we were checking out the menu our server brought us complimentary chips and salsa. You know how sometimes a little thing can make a big difference?? Well they don't bring you a bowl of salsa. They bring a small carafe of salsa and an empty bowl to pour it into. I love this idea because you don't waste salsa. I hate  when people waste food. A lot of times people will barely touch their bowl of salsa and it just gets pitched. This small gesture eliminates waste. (Hopping off my soapbox now). I had ordered a chicken burrito topped with cheese sauce. It came with sour cream, pico, and a guacamole dip. The chicken was shredded. It had been marinated and it was moist. There was also a side of rice. Sometimes rice can be served a little hard but this was cooked just right. I left a \"happy plate\" (meaning I cleaned my plate). I tried my husband's food-a chicken enchilada and a cheese enchilada. I really liked the enchilada sauce. I would definitely order enchiladas the next time I go in.  We really enjoyed our lunch and we already know that we'll go back soon.",

We loved the BYOB and that they didn't charge a \"cork\" fee or give us any problems about it, especially when one mom brought a bag of supplies to make a specialty drink.   The only reason I did 4 stars instead of 5 was that our server didn't really come over much to check on us.  I had a diet coke and was always waiting a long time for refills. Overall we appreciated that they accommodated our group so well.  The parking lot is a little tight, but that wasn't a huge problem.",

They offer many lunch specials, and my wife and I have never found anything on their menu that wasn't the best prepared, presented and most tasty Mexican food we have ever eaten.     We have often stopped in to get a pint or two of their salsa to go when we are having a party or tailgate, and everyone always comments on how great the salsa is and asks where we got it. They don't sell it bottled, you get it in a styrofoam container and it is half the price you would pay for some name brand bottled commercially produced salsa. I cannot recommend it enough.  They don't have a liquor license, so it is BYOB. Can't wait till they get a license so that we can enjoy a Margarita with our meal.   We truly love this restaurant and stop in there every chance we get. IT IS THAT GOOD!",

Think Chipotle burrito but made fresh  (and tasted way better) and toped with guacamole, salsa, cheese, and sour creamThe beef inside tastes like it was a slow cooked barbecue of the highest quality. It had just enough if a tang to to be satisfying but not quite spicy. My dad enjoyed two hot sauces at the table, one hot and one EXTREMELY hot.  Service was friendly and helpful in understanding the HUGE menu. Being unused to many Mexican food terms the glossary in the back was helpful (But I have a feeling anything you order here is going to be amazing)  They don't have a liquor license yet, but it's BYOB!

While chatting and enjoying some chips and salsa I noticed how welcoming the environment Is. The staff were all in an upbeat mood which can really add more to a dining experience. Several people had come in with their own alcohol and were having a good time. You can tell this is a favorite spot in the area. The parking lot was starting to fill up quickly. Our food was very flavorful. I hate going to locations where everything tastes the same and bland. I got the fajita burrito which was huge and delicious. Forgot to snap a picture before devouring most of it. Also sampled the Chile Verde (my fave) Chile Relleno and Azteca Burrito. The Chili Verde was not spicy to me but the flavors were on point. The menu has many options which is great for vegetarians or others who are picky eaters. Also note to be cautious getting in and out of the parking lot.

The place was crowded and surprisingly enough there were quite a few spanish-speakers, so it was a great sign that this place was worth a try.  The menu is quite extensive with favorites like chile colorado, chilaquiles, flan, carnitas, etc.  (No mole, though)  The salsa was good, and the chips were thick and warm, and the waiters were overloaded but quite nice. I got the chile verde and my honey got the carnitas.  Mine was quite good and nicely spicy and his was not as good (we were expecting small char-grilled chunks instead of big simmered pieces) BUT with all the options on the menu we were quite delighted and excited about coming back.  That said, we felt completely MSG \"snowed\" afterward, and so will try it a couple more times to see if choosing something else will help.  But YES, I'd definitely recommend it as a really good option if you're tired of the bland places that serve french fries with their fajitas.  (You know who you are)",

In my latest attempt to order takeout I arrived and looked around to see why no one answers the phone. I learned that the phone is in a cubby around the corner by the front door. Odd for a restaurant that likely gets a ton of phone calls for takeout. Who knows how many takeout orders they've lost because they can't get their act together.

    "text": "I've eaten at Casa Nayarit several times before. It's less than 3 minutes from my house, and my whole family has loved the food, especially my kids who are picky eaters. I struggle to write a negative review because of how positive our experiences have been to date, but unfortunately I have to let others know of our recent experience because it seems to be something that will be the case in the future.  I called ahead to order for pickup, as I always do, and I ordered a combination number one with beans instead of rice. The person put me on hold, then about 2 minutes later a younger-sounding person came on the line and told me that there were no substitutions. I always use the menu on their website when ordering and it clearly states that there are no substitutions aside from rice and beans, which I was ordering. When I told her that I've ordered this many times before and it states it on the website, her response was (verbatim) \"Yeah we didn't design the website and we've got new staff now so there's no substitutions no matter what.\" She was incredibly rude about it, which caught me so off guard that I just told them I would order elsewhere, and that seemed to be of no concern.  I ended up driving 25 minutes to get food from El Campesino in McMurray, who was fine with all my substitutions and it was a great experience. I hate to say that I won't be going back to Casa Nayarit, but sometimes customer service is more important than the proximity of the location or the taste of the food. I'd like to think this was just a one-off occurrence, but based on what she told me, it looks like they've officially put customer service in the back seat unfortunately, at least for the foreseeable future.",

We liked it so much we took some to go lol I got the enchilada Jalisco with beans and rice for dinner. The chicken was seasoned just right and it was shredded instead of diced which I love. The beans and rice were also quite tasty! My boyfriend was a little disappointed with his choice of dinner because the tacos were made with ground beef. We took advantage of the byob and literally brought a cooler with us into the restaurant. Warning this place looks a little shady on the outside but it's definitely worth giving it a try.",

The restaurant is tucked away off South Park Drive and is on the smaller side, but the food is delicious.   We had a table for 8. My choice was the Pollo con Crema and rice. The portions were generous but not too huge and everything was delicious. Service was lovely too. I think they rock the salsa world - I could eat the salsa and chips nonstop if left to my own devices. So very yummy!",

It's not the best Mexican I've had in my life, and they are serving the tacos with sour cream which made me wonder if the food was the real deal, but the quality of everything I ate was solid.  I was glad that the corn tortillas served with the beef tacos asada (you can get chicken if you prefer it) were not greasy as they sometimes can be at Mexican taquerias. I loved the salsa and warm chips. The meal wasn't heavy but it hit the spot. I wish they had radishes, cilantro, lime, and other standard toppings to add to the tacos though.  I'd prefer that to sour cream. The portion size was good and so was the price. This place is much better than commercialized Mexican restaurants that serve $20 guacamole made at your table and substandard food to unsuspecting customers.  Give it a try!",

They don't overload it with too much rice and beans as filler. The pico is good and the orders come with chips and salsa.   I saw that the website hints at online ordering is coming soon which would alleviate any of the headache that is calling in a takeout order. Frankly, wherever they are answering the phone is just super loud and as a result, it's always hard to hear on both ends of the phone. It has caused a delay or mix up of orders in the past, but that hasn't deterred me as of yet. It is a quality, local, non-chain restaurant nearby that I am happy to support.",
