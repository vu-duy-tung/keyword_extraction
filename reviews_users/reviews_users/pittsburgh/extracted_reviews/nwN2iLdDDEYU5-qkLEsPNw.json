Thanks to Yelp we found this little gem in a small strip mall behind Dunkin and Denny's and still in walking distance to our hotel. We were there for breakfast shortly before 9 on a Sunday morning.  I had the French toast with strawberries and it was really tasty. My husband had a western omelet and really enjoyed it. The staff was friendly and welcoming and we had very little wait time for anything. Bypass the chain places and go just a short step off the main road to get a delicious start to your day.",

The sausage was definitely microwave sausage. The \"banana\" pancakes were nothing more than the over cooked flavorless pancakes with a sliced banana on top.  My wife had the bacon and corn pancakes. The menu leads you to believe this dish is going to be some sort of griddle cake with corn in the batter. Nope. Just some canned corn dumped on top of three pancakes with microwave bacon and cheese in them. Was one of the most bizarre food presentations I've seen. Sadly, this restaurant makes the chain restaurants nearby look like Michelin star rated restaurants.",

It came with 4 small pancakes that would shame the cities most popular spots (light crispy outside texture across the whole pancake and super fluffy inside!  Yep, perfection!!!  I can't wait to go back and try ALL of their other dishes!  Finally, I'm a True coffee snob and their coffee was again excellent!  This place is a must do, it's worth the drive and it is awesome!

I believe that word is spreading about how special this \"petit \" cafe is.  Ask for orange juice and receive freshly squeezed topped with a strawberry. In fact everything is fresh and made to order.  Today we had the vegetable omelet which was served with pancakes. You could get toast instead but those pancakes are melt in your mouth delicious. Also had the banana pancakes with a side of ham. The crepes are wonderful too, served with a salad. The proprietors are French with Turkish heritage. So welcoming and accomadating!  The decor is lovely with a French theme throughout.  The coffee is strong reflecting a European brew .  Lots of coffee drinks available too.",

That's ridiculous and so wasteful! This is the reason why sea animals are choking on plastic, Petite Dejeuner!  The workers got the order wrong numerous times and when we asked to have our coffee in a to-go cup, the lady snarled and stomped into the kitchen. WHILE she played a game on her phone. If you even talk to the waitress, she acts like you're in convincing her. The sandwiches were mediocre and everything was SO overpriced. No one was washing dishes which explains why everything was on styrofoam plates! Apparently, they don't feel like washing anything! Not even a cup or a plate!

The omelet I ordered was massive... the egg was cooked perfect ... not burned or over cooked anywhere:.. the bread... oh the bread! Soft ... lightly toasted.. warm... best toast I've ever had ... no doubt it was home made bread... because no store made bread would taste this good... thick slices... and they served my omelet with a salad which was a perfect accent to the breakfast...   It is sad that I cannot finish the omelet... it was huge and every bite better than the last... I am in this area for one more day and you better believe I will be here tomorrow and, if I ever get the chance to return to the area, I will be here each and every day for breakfast!!  Yelp: one suggestion - allow me to leave 10 stars instead of 5 cause this place deserves every star I can give it and more that I cannot!",

They open early and have easy sides of fruit, etc that come out fast and in the right portions for kids.

Definitely worth the trip and easy/free parking never hurts.",

    "text": "So my first impressions on this place were very wrong. In the Gino Brothers name sake I thought of great anyway they can make more money which isn't a bad thing but I've had equally mixed experiences with Gino Bros. First time we were here it was a very busy Saturday morning. We got in and got table immediately but by 20 minutes later it was standing room only. I thought it was crazy cause the prices aren't cheap. Then our food arrived. Looked really good. By far the best omelette I've had in a really long time. Eggs light and yet cooked to perfection. Packed with cheese. Delicious!!! The four little pancakes that say are 2 as a side choice are fantastic. Pancakes cooked that are thicker yet not doughy or lumpy. Just perfect. Really fantastic offering. My wife got the ham and mozzarella crepe with side fresh greens and said it was fantastic and to die for. She really liked it. Everything is so fresh and cooked impeccably well. They have a unique community table in the middle of the restaurant with 4 long benches which I find different yet inviting to bring people together. The decor is really nice and very clean yet trendy. The bathrooms are the nicest cleanest bathrooms I've seen in I think ever. The coffee/espresso machine is pretty cool looking too! Lol. I highly recommend coming here. It's kind of a hidden gem in my honest opinion. Fantastic! Also and how could I forget the service is friendly and welcoming and very attentive! Bravo!",
