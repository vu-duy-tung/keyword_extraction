Unlike Hofbrauhaus, you won't find live accordion music or dancing on the tables here, but what you will find is a quality German meal.  I say leave places like the Hofbrauhaus to the tourists, I want a real German meal.  I went for lunch this past weekend and had a kielbasa sandwich with sauerkraut on it.  It was very good, exactly what I wanted from a German restaurant and the service was good too.  The food was served with rolls and a side.  I substituted a spinach salad with hot bacon dressing for a side.  I've been to Max's a few times and have been very pleased with both the food and service. I recommend trying the spinach salad with hot bacon dressing, potato pancakes, and the pretzels.",

The corned beef and cabbage sandwich was great and definitely one of my favorites. We also did the sampler platter, consisting of wiener schnitzel, Jagerschnitzel, and sauerbraten. Everything overall is really good and pretty authentic. Our server was on her shit too! Great pre bus and we never had an empty glass. We came here because a friend came just yesterday for the first time and raved about it, I'm glad we came, and we will definitely be back!",

My favorite item is the potato pancake turkey reuben sandwich, which is prepared with turkey and cole slaw. However, during this visit, the potato pancakes were overcooked and the accompanying German potato salad was served at room temperature. The fish sandwich was large, hot, and delicious. It was accompanied by sweet & sour red cabbage, which tasted great. The server was quite pleasant and efficient, which is normally the case. I will definitely return to this restaurant, because the atmosphere is welcoming and the food is very good.",

It's a long-time North Side staple, and the atmosphere has a \"well worn\" appeal with old pictures of the local Germanic community and of the area.  This place has it's own personality!  As for the food... well, you can't find much better German food than this and at this price!  Both of my parents favor the peasant platter.  Me, I love the stuffed pretzel appetizer, all the different sausages (the weisswurst is amazing!), and their kasespatzle (thick, doughy egg noodles with butter and cheese).  I will always associate Max's with the best, most flavorful German food at an affordable price!",

Max's is cozy in a neighborhood hangout kind of way, with a menu that will hit the spot if \"nouvelle\" is not your favorite cuisine.  They do have a vegetarian sandwich, but we went for the potato pancake reubens (turkey and regular) with onion rings and apple sauce and were very pleased.  The pancake batter is on the floury side, so they are more pancake than latke, but they were good nonetheless.    If I lived a little closer, I'd be here all the time - local North Side brews, and a menu I'm looking forward to exploring from top to bottom. They even have my favorite dessert from when I was little, Black Forest cake, so you know I'll be back for that.",

    "text": "Max's is a great place for German food.  I've had several sandwiches, most of the appetizers and even the Sunday brunch (which has a good spread but can be hit or miss) -  though not all in one visit.  I most recently took my Mom out for dinner using a Living Social deal I had.  Somehow, even though we have both been to Max's quite a few times before neither of us had ever seen the sampler platter option on their menu.  For just a bit more than the cost of the regular entrees, you can choose three entrees and two sides.  Obviously the portions of each selection are smaller than the individual meals, but the size is still generous and there were only a couple things not available for the sampler platter.  Between the two of us we selected six different items and four different sides to try and shared everything - and still had enough left for a full meal each the next day.  I can't even decide on my favorite of all the items we tried.  If you aren't sure about some of the entrees, this is a great way to see what you like.  I personally loved everything so much that I think my new go-to menu item from now on will be the sampler platter.  Not being forced to choose just one item is what living in America is all about.  All together I think our bill was around $35 (no alcoholic beverages consumed).  Some might consider this a tad pricey but the food is so good I usually don't mind the slightly higher cost.  Service has never been a problem for me in fact they've always been helpful when I have questions about the menu.  Full bar with numerous good beers on tap.  If you want German food in Pittsburgh, Max's is definitely the place to start.",

After that, though, things definitely improved. I loved the slightly shabby, old-world vibe. The old photos on the wall were interesting, and the menu slash old newspaper was a pretty cute presentation.   We got appetizers for dinner, and my favorite by miles was the potato pocket with grilled onions on top. (Basically a pierogi.) So good. So, so good. I actually wasn't as excited about the potato pancakes as I expected - maybe because I was expecting more of a latke style flavor profile? Not sure. We also got the stuffed pretzels - total heart attack on a plate - in a good way! I loved that everything we got came with dipping sauces. So fun.   Overall a positive experience. I'd go back.",

From bar menus which are sticky, beer sampler holder which is sticky, and food menus with cup rings on them to food which is literally inedible.  I ordered the Schnitzel Lichtenstein (my go-to) and it was greasy, fatty, oddly colored meat.  The Brussel Sprout in a Bacon Sauce served soggy sprouts and didn't have any of the bacon sauce on it.  The Spatzle was luke warm.  This would be a great place for one of those \"Kitchen Nightmare\" shows.  So sad to see Max's Allegheny Tavern has gone downhill.",

I'm honestly not a die-hard fan of German food, although I guess that wouldn't have mattered: a peak at the menu beforehand revealed that this place's menu is mostly Americanized - proof of this is the fact that my salad was topped with French fries (only in Pittsburgh...). Trust me, even if you don't really like German food, there'll at least be a sandwich you'll like here.  Thinking about my usual \"overall\" summary, I have to say this place wasn't bad and served as a reasonable place to meet - the beer menu looked nice from what I saw and the atmosphere was pretty cozy and even nostalgic and homely - but man, the dining options really weren't that extraordinary. I'm still torn as to how to feel about its menu, because on the one hand obviously it being Americanized meant even I could find something to enjoy, but on the other I feel bad for the people who do like German food and may not be getting what they hope for.   It wasn't bad enough that I'd say don't try it and see - just understand it may not be exactly what you expect.",

I love the German beer flights (i.e., beer sampler) and the atmosphere is funny - a bit like your grandmother's parlor. The bread that comes with entrees is delicious (pumperknickel + others), and their cherry sauer kraut is delicious as well.  The food is good, but you must be careful with certain dishes. One of the schnitzels that comes with carrots/peas is clearly bedecked in carrots & peas that were recently frozen. German food isn't exactly known for its vegetables, so I let it slide but I always remember not to order that dish when I'm there.",

    "text": "New German food (non-pork sausage, interpretive sauerkraut, over-engineered potato salad) is on the rise even as Old German (sauerbraten, potato pancakes, leberkese) dries up.  Max's offers some of the best Old German, in one of the coziest old-time settings, in Pittsburgh or anywhere else.    Not every dish is a home run, but the sheer range of the menu is amazing, and the sampler platter is a Deutschophile's dream.  The spatzle were not hand-pulled, but neither were they dried.  The sauerbraten was too thin and under-marinated, but where else can you even find such a dish?  The weisswurst was thin and flecked with parsley, which technically makes it a bockwurst(?), but again, who else even does veal sausage?  Potato pancakes, smoked pork chop, sauerkraut, and red cabbage were all excellent.    I love the apple butter in the bread basket, and the slice of baked apple on the entree plate.  Sure, it's artificially colored, but that's how they did it in the old days.  Black forest cake was pretty weak, but German chocolate cake looks good in other reviews.  The beer selection was an excellent combination of German and domestic, and the mysterious \"Dutch Club dark\" (made in-house?) was uncommonly smooth and delicious.    If you can't deal with anything that's not hip or trendy, stay away.  If you're open to a trip back in time, come!",

I had a hot pastrami sandwich and my wife had a turkey ruben. The meat on both sandwiches was scarce and my pastrami was so over cooked it was crunchy. Not a good look for pastrami. My wife, who thinks Subway has too much meat on there sandwiches, said more that half of her bread was without meat. Needless to say we will not be going back.",

Everything from multiple varieties of schnitzels, sausages, chickens and a sampler platter that lets you choose a combination of all of the above.  All of the items we tried were full of flavor and served at the perfect temperature.  Speaking of being full, the food is very rich so you will leave with a full stomach.    They have a good selection of beers and even offer a sampler option.  The dessert selection looked delicious, but we were beyond stuffed so will have to savor them on a future visit.

Over the years we have had so many family dinners here including my sisters rehearsal dinner, that it's almost become like eating at a relatives house.  But now that relative has gone senile and needs to go to a nursing home, and they can't cook anymore.  For the past two years, every time we come here we say, \"This just isn't as good as I remember.\"  For starters, the food is always served cold.  Don't believe me?  I hope you enjoy tepid knackwurst and cold mashed potatoes.  BTW, to whoever makes their mashed potatoes, you have to boil the potatoes before you mash them.  Yesterday they were undercooked, gritty, and gross.  In fact, all of the food is becoming gross.  My friend got the roasted beef and what came out looked like a cold cut covered with a congealed beef gravy that had bits of carrots in it.  wtf was that????  I'm done.  This place has gone down hill.  You need a new chef, immediately.  Max's is a North Side institution but there are so many new, better restaurants opening up that they really need to up their game.

A quick look at the menu let us know that prices were very fair.  We tried the sausage and cheese sampler appetizer and it was simplicity at it's finest - fresh, delicious sausage, rich cheeses, and an excellent mustard for dipping. I was really impressed with how such a simple appetizer could convey the quality of their food so well. Delicious!  The entrees were equally as tasty. I tried a turkey reuben which came on a potato pancake. Obviously, this particular entree was not the most traditional German faire, but, once you took a bite, there was no going back. A variety of sides were available; I tried the spaetzle - also very simple, but delicious.  Overall, this is a great place - cozy vibe, excellent German food (both traditional and more adventurous), and quick, friendly service. My only regret is not having room to try their tempting desserts. We don't get to the Deutschtown neighborhood often, but we will have to make it a point to go back for Max's Allegheny Tavern.",

    "text": "I have been coming to Max Allegheny Tavern since I was still in my mother's womb.  But seriously.  This place has been an institution for my family, and I really love it here.  I feel like this is some of the only German food in Pittsburgh, and I think it represents fairly well.  My thoughts:  Brunch Buffet- I love the Sunday brunch buffet more than life.  Omelette station, German and American breakfast and lunch foods, and lots and lots of beautiful, delicious, and decadent desserts.  It's heaven on Earth.  There is usually a decent selection of meats, and the potato pancakes are almost always featured.  They've changed it a bit over the years, but I still love this buffet.  Appetizers- My family loves the soft pretzels.  They are so yummy and buttery, but a bit heavy if you are going to eat your entire meal.  So make sure to share.  Meals-  I, personally, have never had a bad meal here.  The sauasages of all varieties have been great.  The weinerschnitzel also great.  Sandwiches all good as well.  I really like the cheesy spaetzle dish that is just like macaroni and cheese but with spaetzle noodles!  I don't get too crazy and order anything complicated, though.  Sides-  I love love love their sides.  I could live on the spaetzle and potato pancakes.  Don't pass the sides up!  Dessert:  Also love their desserts.  There is a chocolate chocolate cake that they heat up with homemade whipped cream that is TO DIE FOR.  Not so shockingly, the apple strudel is wonderful as well.  Besides the food, the servers are always very friendly and efficient.  There is also ample street parking, which is really nice.  Definitley check this place out if you have not yet.",

We got the sausage platter, Bavarian stuffed pretzel, and the Max's sampler platter. I'm still drooling over their stuffed pretzels.    I think what won me over as the basket full of bread. Not only was there a surplus of meat but also bread?? Free? Indescribable happiness.",

We also ordered Max's famous Reuben, nothing famous about it. Extremely light on the corn beef. Nothing special at all. Will NEVER go back.",

We arrived at 5:30 on a Saturday and the place was already packed, with only one booth available in the bar area. Everything was delicious, reasonably priced and arrived quickly after ordering. There is something for everyone both food and drink wise. The bratwurst and spatzle with caramelized onions was some of the best I've had, and the spinach salad with hot bacon dressing is one to not be missed. Portions are decent without being gluttonous. For 2 couples along with a couple rounds of craft beers, our bill was $100. If you're looking for authentic German food with an old school Pittsburgh atmosphere, Max's is the place to go!",

Fried provolone, potato pockets, wings, deep fried pretzels, sausage and cheese plate... all are AMAZING.   2. Sunday brunch buffet, under $14 and better than Grand Concourse. Every week there are omelettes, potato pancakes, waffles, sausage, bacon, pastries, and German farmer's breakfast (eggs, German potato salad, and assorted sliced German sausage all mixed together, so basically the best thing on earth). There are rotating entrees, also. As long as they are vaguely German/American, they are great.   3. The goulash, which is under $10 and comes with a salad (HOT BACON DRESSING) plus assorted rolls with apple butter and sweet/sour cabbage.  4. Free popcorn at the bar.  5. The best waitresses. Ever.",

The spatzles were also very good in a cheesy sauce.  There was some to take home also.  We also got some potato pancakes which were pretty close to the ones my mother used to make.  At the end of our dinner, we split a piece of banana cake which was the highlight of the meal.  It was a two layer cake covered with a not too sweet icing and bananas.  It was just enough for all four of us to split.  I will definitely go back for the exact same meal.  And this time, I will be bringing a spinach salad home for the next day for me.

    "text": "After feeling \"crowded out\" by the throngs of people converging upon Downtown and the North Shore for the Three Rivers Arts Festival this past Sunday we decided to venture a bit deeper into the North Side and give Max's Allegheny Tavern a whirl. My partner has been in the basement before for various work-related functions, but I had never been there, despite driving by on numerous occasions.       We easily found on-street parking and entered the restaurant. I immediately loved the decor in the entry room/bar area, and those pleasant furnishings continued into the more intimate rear room where we were seated. We enjoyed the beautiful wall tapestries, and I thought the old newspaper-like menus were pretty cool! I was surprised (in a good way) at the old-fashioned urinals in the men's room. In a city that has struggled to nourish and revitalize its history over the years I was already a fan of how unique Max's was in the regard of feeling \"authentic\" in an era of predictable chains.       We were initially enticed by the prospect of ordering fried soft pretzels stuffed with cheese as a shared appetizer only to find out they were not available. We settled for the non-cheese-stuffed version, which were \"melt in your mouth\" good and were handsomely complemented by tangy honey mustard. We were a bit dehydrated after walking miles around the city, yet our waitress was very attentive in consistently replenishing our water glasses as soon as they were half-empty. I was craving a burger but was tempted instead by the fried fish sandwich, which I ordered with a side of potato pancakes and applesauce. My partner ordered a fried chicken sandwich with the same side I did.       Our food arrived surprisingly promptly. My fish sandwich was HUGE! I had enough to take home and enjoy for a post-work meal the following evening. The fish tasted fresh, although I wasn't a fan of having to pick small bones out of my mouth in exchange for enjoying that freshness. The bread it was served upon was tasty as well. The potato pancakes were thick, fresh, and were delicious when enjoyed with the chunky applesauce. My partner also thoroughly enjoyed his own sandwich.       As if this wasn't good enough our check was only $22! We will definitely be back soon, at which point I look forward to trying a burger!",

It had lots of sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, and sauce with the meat piled high. It is one of the best Reubens I have ever had. The chips were thinly sliced and very crispy. There was no need for a dipping sauce, the chips were very good just plain. They had 3 or 4 desserts that looked good but I chose the German Chocolate cake. It's one of my very favorite desserts. There were 3 layers of chocolate cake. In between the layers of cake there is coconut, chocolate, and pecans. The outside of the cake is frosted with a chocolate whipped frosting. It was really good.

I liked the fact that the sampler plate let me try 3 different entrees and 2 sides, but the food was just OK.   Now for the real stuff:   We will probably never be back here. My boyfriend got the wiener schnitzel with a side of the potato salad. He said \"the schnitzel had potential.\" It was clearly deep fried, which is not how it should be prepared (pan fried), and when he cut into it, a flood of grease streamed out. German food is often heavy, but this was just oily and greasy. The meat was good though, and mostly cut to the right thickness. The potato salad, on the other hand, was really gross. It tasted like potatoes from a mall Chinese restaurant. They were sweet and sloppy and just... totally inedible.   The potato pancakes came out looking exactly like regular pancakes, not traditional potato pancakes. The texture was a little funny, almost like not all of the potatoes were fully cooked.   Of my sampler platter, I'd say that the sauerbraten (kind of a pot roast) was the highlight. I did not like the pork and I had the same thoughts about the mini schnitzel.   Also, I think the waitress may have been a little dim. When ordering, I requested that the bread basket omit the apple butter because I am ALLERGIC to apples. 10 seconds later, I ordered the potato pancakes as one of my sides and she asked if I wanted the applesauce with them. No. I didn't.",

The potato pancakes were dull...I don't think there was any salt in them. The cheese-stuffed pretzels were very good!  The following day was the 2nd annual Deutschtown Music Festival.

    "text": "Max's is so very Pittsburgh.  The bottomless Sunday brunch is more gut-busting American continental than authentic German, with sauerkraut served next to the Polish kielbasas and a chafing dish of mac and cheese next to the red cabbage.  It's a good deal if you're sitting at the bar all day to watch a game or can put down assorted meats like you own the food chain.  Some lighter fare included a bowl of fruit salad and a lox platter, but the rest of the buffet was dominated by sausage, bacon, chicken, and other land animal fare galore.  Vegetarians can indulge in a omelet cooked to order on one of two portable butane burners--major props to the employee one-manning this show who clearly flips one-handed omelettes in his sleep by now.  Vegans not welcome.    I'll try the menu in hopes of something closer to German food if I ever come back.  Otherwise, it's a bit pricey for the quality of food served, especially with coffee and tea disappointingly not included.  Don't come here for style and glamor--do come to fill a post-marathon-sized void of butchered-animal desire.  What you see is what you get.",

I recently spent a few weeks in Germany and after being there, I feel I can vouch that Max's is the real deal when it comes to German cuisine. The interior has the look and feel of what comes to mind when thinking of a European pub. The staff is warm and courteous and the service is top notch. I got waited on promptly and lunch was in front of me within ten minutes of my ordering it.    My meal today consisted of one of the items on the \"February Specials\" list. It was breaded veal on a plate smothered in a brown mushroom gravy (think Jager Schnitzel and substitute veal for pork) with Hot German Potato Salad, Sauerkraut and some homemade rolls. Delicious!   My only disappointment was that I came here for lunch on a work day and couldn't include one of the German imports thas was on tap.  They have (notably) Hacker-Pschorr Weisse, Hacker-Pschorr Munich Gold, Kostritzer Schwarzbier, Warsteiner Pils. There's also Yuengling Lager and Iron City products available on tap, but common, drinking a domestic while enjoying schnitzel or wurst simply makes no sense to me.   We're lucky to have such a fine German establishment in our city. Genieen Sie das Essen!",

I don't eat rabbit- not knowingly anyway.  The ambience is very cool. One of my favorite things about Pittsburgh is little historical places like this.   I had spatzle and cheese. It was just okay. I mean, it's hard to mess up anything you melt cheese over. I also ordered the flight of German beers- and this I would recommend.  Service was decent. Our waitress was kind and helpful, but we were seated at a table that was too small to accommodate our selections. I had to give away most of my salad when my meal arrived because there was just not room for it on the table.   The area is sketchy and probably not safe to linger around at night. Admittedly I am not in that area often, but it's a shame because it's got a lot of culture.",

This was the way to go. Also had a lighter beer that I can't remember the name of. And to top it off had a piece of the banana cream cake that was amazing! Will be back to Max's for sure.

We waited more than 20 minutes to put in a drink order. The order of one beer took almost 15 minutes. The whole meal took about 1 hour and 45 minutes. The place is comfortable and we had the time but normally, that is unacceptable. The spaetzle was bland, the potato pancakes were rubbery, and the wurst along with everything else was warm not hot. The schnitzel was nothing special either. When the reviews are consistently good, we will go back. Between the extremely slow service and the not so great food, it will be a while until we return. It is a shame Max's deteriorated. The highlight was outstanding German beer. I would go back for that but nothing else.",

The grilled pulled pork sandwich looked like something you could buy in the freezer section at Walmart that had been sitting under a heat lamp for a couple days. I got the turkey Reuben on potato pancakes- that was hands down the worst thing I've ever gotten. The potato pancakes were dense and had a both bland and bad taste. The turkey tasted like it was from a banquet frozen dinner. Needless to say I didn't finish it. The only edible item we received was the Bavarian nachos.   So in short, don't be fooled by the reviews or the need for reservations. If you don't want your night to revolve around the running joke of \"ew who picked that place?\"  then you should not eat here. Very, very disappointing.",

Coming in late on a weeknight, there were barely any other customers, but they graciously took us in and provided us with great service the entire time. The menu is cute with a historical newspaper replication on the outside, which was great for learning about this place and its origins.  The menu is quite large, but thankfully there are sampler options which allow for trying multiple options at once. Seeing as most also come with two sides, this made for a very big meal. The sausages were fantastic and flavorful, as were the schnitzels, which were perfectly seasoned and very tender. The one topped with the runny egg and anchovies was especially memorable and is convincing enough to just get that by itself next time. Some favorite sides included the spatzle, which was soft and chewy, and of course the potato pancakes. Definitely would return to try more again next time.",

We ordered the soft pretzel appetizer and the sausage and cheese plate, and both were very tasty! The mustard dipping sauce is phenomenal! I couldn't get enough of it. I wish I had left room for dessert because everything sounded spectacular.   The restaurant itself, which I heard used to be an old hotel, was quaint and cozy.

Would love the sweet & sour relish in a side size portion it is so delicious. The red dining room is nicely decorated and love the cuckoo clock that is reminiscent of my grandmother's.

If you are a hard core gotta go go go American, this is not the place for you.  The food reminds me of sitting in Staufen Germany at a little Bed and Breakfast's cafe that we stayed at.  Nice friendly feel but they just let you be and check on you occasionally.  I like it and recommend it.  Have taken many friends and family there and they agree.  So if you go, prepare to just relax and spend time with your family.  If you are an entitled American that feels wait staff must wipe your hind quarters and as soon as your drink is half way empty be on it....get a life as the world doesn't revolve around you.",

    "text": "How can there be no reviews of Max's Allegheny? This north side German food institution in Pittsburgh has been around for years and years and has menus that tell you so. They also tell you the story of the north side of Pittsburgh, which I also found interesting. The place itself has a lot of character and looks like it's seen a lot of years there. It's a little weathered, but definitely homey and sturdy.  Randy S. and I headed there post Tazza D'Oro on a Sunday for brunch. It happened to be the same very Sunday the Pens were playing the Flyers in game 7, so all the waitresses were wearing Pens paraphernalia, which definitely added to the experience. On Sunday morning it has a brunch buffet with all the standards, plus a healthy dose of Germanic add ons like German farmers breakfast (eggs, sausage and gravy-ed potatoes), red cabbage, pork chops, sauerkraut and potato pancakes.   The brunch buffet is in a room with a giant tapestry of Neuschwanstein behind the guys at the omelet bar. If that's not rad, I don't know what is. We told the waitress we were going in, went and got back and sat down to find our two ice teas on the table in mason jars (always dope).   The food was just what you would expect in Pittsburgh: gut busting. It wasn't artisinal or fancy, healthy or particularly remarkable, but it was pretty fonking good and to eat that food in that restaurant really made me feel like I was in Pittsburgh. I can imagine all the food there would be of the 'hot and brown' category, in a positive way. And the waitress was probably the nicest on our drive from Dallas to CT.   A really fun place, if showing it's age (though remorselessly).",

We sat at the bar and had a drink and in what must have been only ten minutes we were asked if we would mind eating at a booth in the bar area rather than wait for the dinning room.  We were thrilled, because we were considering eating at the bar.  The booth worked out just fine.  It wasn't too noisy and  we got served quickly.  Even though there were several specials that tempted us, we both ordered the best thing on the menu - their Jager Schnitzel, with sides of hot German potato salad and sweet and sour cabbage.  I had a German black lager and my wife a glass of wine.  The basket of assorted rolls comes with delicious apple butter and sauerkraut relish, both very tasty.  The schnitzel is quite large, and we only made it about halfway thru when we asked for a to-go box.  We're looking forward to finishing it here at home.  Maybe next time we'll try something different....but probably not! Pros: inexpensive, very tasty schnitzels Cons: no reservations for parties under 5",

    "text": "I like this restaurant so much I had my wedding rehearsal dinner here.  (Both the families liked the food very much.)  Max's is the best German food in Pittsburgh -- actually, it's the best German food I've had outside of Germany, and I've definitely had worse meals in Germany as well.  Max's is in a restored hotel, and the decor is very much in the Victorian style of the original hotel building.  The exception is the bar area that's good for happy hour or watching a game, or just having a beer -- that has a lot of neon and a jukebox.  But the bar area is also tasteful and pleasant to be in.  Max's has a full bar, but their real specialty is their excellent selection of German beers, both in bottles and on tap.  I haven't met a wurst I didn't like, and they're pretty much all offered here.  The Braunschweiger sandwich is pretty delicious and unique in my experience, and the schnitzels are very delicious as well.  Another specialty is the kase spatzle (Spatzle noodles with smoked Gouda cheese -- a twist on mac and cheese that ensures that even a picky child will have something to enjoy here), but my two favorite menu picks here are the hassenpfeffer and the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing.  For sides, the red cabbage salad is my favorite, although the sauerkraut is also very good.  I don't care for the German potato salad, however -- I like the kind that has caraway seeds and vinegar, and is served cold, but Max's offers the kind that has an unidentifiable sauce and is served warm.  Some people like that style of potato salad though, and from what I can tell, Max's does a decent rendition of it.  If you're looking to reserve a room here for a banquet, you have a lot of options.  The basement \"Rathskellar\" is more bar-like in its atmosphere.  It would be a good place for some guys to have a birthday party or something.  For a rehearsal dinner or other formal event, one of the upstairs banquet rooms would be better.  Depending on the size of your group, you can arrange to have a buffet-style dinner, or individuals in the group can order directly off the regular dinner menu.",

Ate and received the check in less than an hour... now that's how I like it...   Can't wait to go back.. Thanks Max's Allegheny Tavern ...",

The hosts and servers looked like they've worked there for years, and were genuinely knowledgeable about the cuisine.  Even the prices were what I'd consider competitive 20 years ago, as a family of six only ran up a bill of $100.  The only complaint I have is the food itself, which was largely hit and miss.  The German potato salad was awful, and the kielbasa was undercooked.  The rest of the meal was fine, but nothing mind blowing.  Give it a try if you're really into German food and like a fun atmosphere.",

We sat in the bar and enjoyed a flight of beer to figure out which ones we liked best.  Max's has a variety plate where you can assemble a plate with the items you want.  We got Weiner schnitzel, bratwurst, smoked pork loin, spaezle, and red cabbage.  And more beer, of course.  Everything was very tasty and we finished everything except the red cabbage.  It was fine but we were full.  Really, the food was just terrific.    Oh, yeah - the service was good, too.  Fast and very friendly.  Nice female server who was very helpful with the beer order.

Aside from the ethereal wings, the waiting staff was friendly and helpful, the atmosphere in general was fantastic, and they regularly have local bands playing.

    "text": "We really enjoyed our dinner at Max's Allegheny Tavern this past weekend.  While out enjoying different breweries' celebrations for Oktoberfest we really wanted to have some tasty home cooked German food to soak up our beverages.  We arrived around dinnertime and they were busy, but we were able to snag a couple of seats at the bar.  I am a bar kind of gal so I never mind eating at one.    To start we got a German Beer flight.   For $10.00, I totally recommend ordering this.  It allows you to taste four German style beers that are not easily accessible in other establishments.  They were all very good, but I believe my favorite was the Warsteiner.  We placed our order with Patrick, the bar keep, and sat back and enjoyed our flight.  Max's atmosphere is rather dark and dated but that adds to the charm of the old world ambiance.  For our dinners we decided we on the Bavarian Peasant Platter * 15.95 \"Bauern Platte\". A heaping mound of our famous sauerkraut, surrounded by a grilled bratwurst, knackwurst and a smoked loin pork chop.\" This came with two sides, which were potato pancakes and Spatzle.  We also ordered a Max's Sausage Platter * 13.95 Wunderbar! A sampling of our finest wursts. . . knackwurst, bratwurst and weisswurst, with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies.  The food was ample!  It might have been too much if we were not so hungry.  I loved all the sausages and the spicy mustard they pass around the bar.  The pork chop was juicy and cooked nicely.  The potato pancakes were ok, they certainly could have had a little more flavor. However, the spatzel was really underwhelming.  It had no taste and the texture was doughy.  I would not recommend that.  The \"heaping mound\" of sauerkraut was not heaping.  It really should have been a much bigger portion to enjoy with all the sausages.  It is the cheapest thing on the plate so why be stingy.  However, the flavor of the kraut was phenomenal!   Max's will definitely get our repeat business when we're in the mood for some German cuisine.  Heben Sie Ihre Glaser, Prost!",

The service was respectable, as our server was attentive and told us the prep times of various appetizers so that food and appetizers wouldn't come out at the same time.  The food was another story.  Everything was incredibly bland.  The sauces had no flavor.  The vegetables had no seasoning, and tasted freezer-burned.  The spaetzle wasn't cooked with any butter, parsley, pepper, cheese, or anything.  They were just tiny lumps of flour noodle.  Nothing we ate was particularly interesting or tasty.  It was just kind of there on the plate.  If this were $9 at a diner, it would be fine.  But $18 is absurd to charge for these dishes.",

Made a reservation and asked for a nice table for a special occasion. Was stuffed in the very small room in the back like a sardine, by the door - unbelievably uncomfortable, table too small for the group and would be bumped by people coming through, into the room. I asked the waitress if this was the only table she had and she said yeah and ran off. I looked around saw other tables available and had to go back out and ask the hostess for another table and her attitude and distain was apparent. Then we get the worst waitress...she kept saying take your time and took forever to take our order and serve our food. Then find out one of the dishes ordered is not available and it took at least 20 minutes to tell us. We see another waitress at a table beside us explain the beers available and the specials for the day...we are like wow wish we would have received that service. Food was good, which is the only reason I am giving a 3. The place was a little dirty too...food under our table that looks like had been there all week. They need to get rid of those unattractive plants in the windows and wash their windows and door with windows.",

When I say scratch, I mean the sauerkraut she served was made with the cabbage she raised in her garden and me and my little brother helped to shred and can. Since she passed I have spent a long time trying to find a restaurant that could even hold a candle to her cooking and today I think I finally have. Everything I ate here tonight made me think of my nana. The potato pancakes were perfect, the sauerkraut was so good that I ordered seconds. The apple butter had just the right amount of cinnamon. The cabbage relish was excellent on the pumpernickel bread.  If you haven't figured it out by now I would suggest if you want German food in Pittsburgh you need to go to this place and go hungry. Our waitress was also perfect. We were so full we couldn't eat dessert so she boxed it up so we could eat it later at the hotel.",

In the past, I've found that about 70% of the time, the food is great, but the other 30% is in a range from \"meh\" to awful. Unfortunately, yesterday was the worst dinner ever, foodwise.  The hostess was gracious and friendly, the waitress was competent and attentive, but the food was a huge disappointment this time. Two of us ordered the Einlauf soup that I usually love, and the jagerschnitzel, which is my favorite German dish. The soup was barely lukewarm, a weak broth with no flavor at all, and the gobs of dumplings were just barely cooked doughballs. Good dumplings are always lighter than they look, but these couldn't be lightened up if you tied them to helium balloons. I ordered my schnitzel with spaetzle and applesauce, and one of the other diners had it with spaetzle and red cabbage. Not only were the entrees served almost cold, but the schnitzels were flavorless, gristly, and chewy - probably the worst I've ever had anywhere. I couldn't finish half of mine because it was inedible. The spaetzle was like cold, uncooked gnocchi. The only parts of my meal that had flavor were the applesauce and the mushroom gravy - and the gravy was right out of a can, gloppy and oversalted. On other occasions when I've ordered exactly the same meal, my food was fresh, delicious, homemade (or seemed to be) and of excellent quality.  Please don't accept a standard of poor quality, Max's! We have so few German restaurants here, and you were always the best by far.",

The portions are huge--entrees come with your choice of two sides.  I always get the potato pancakes and the spatzle.  The pancakes come with a side of chunky applesauce (it tastes homemade and not overly sweet) as well as sour cream.  The spatzle comes with gravy (I believe it is pork gravy) and are always perfectly cooked.  Other sides that are good is the German-style potato salad and the slaw (v. tangy in a vinegar sauce).  Their saurbraten is good and my friend swears by the rabbit dishes, but I almost always get the sausage sampler.  The sausages are always fresh, perfectly cooked and Max's carries a nice spicy/brown mustard that's a perfect accompaniment.  I have yet to get dessert there, because I obviously cannot exercise any control and gooble up everything on my plate (an assortment of breads and rolls also come with the dinner, and the apple butter is very good).  However, they do have a nice selection of desserts, ranging from cake to strudel.    Their non-German options are also very good:  vegetarian sandwich and omelettes are good and available for lunch.  And they're usually in the Entertainment/Enjoy book-great to save some jingle money.  Even without a discount, for the quality and quantity of food, it's an excellent value.",

    "text": "Greatest place in Pittsburgh for German food!!  My favorite dinner here is Max's Goulash.  Its a great beef stew with spaetzle and you can get potato pancakes on the side.  The potato pancakes are, without a doubt, the best in Pittsburgh!!  While the food is fantastic, the staff and customer service is what keeps this place from being really excellent.  Its a very \"come as you are\" sort of place and rightfully so as it's a tavern/restaurant but the staff may take the casual nature of the restaurant a little too seriously.  One evening about a year ago, I went in for dinner.  I originally thought to sit at a wooden booth in the bar and there was only 1 open, the last towards the back.  I sat down and the seat completely collapsed on me!  I'm far from what you'd call \"fat\" \"heavy set\" or even a \"big girl\" and the staff just sort of stared at me as though it were my fault that their booth just fell apart, the bartender even laughed at me while I tried to get up.  No one asked if I was ok, no one asked if I needed help and I was generally ignored as I tried to pull myself to my feet.  *I* had to approach the hostess, tell her that the booth had just collapsed and ask to be reseated.  She rolled her eyes at me and told me the dining room was full so I'd have to wait.    Ok, understandable... could you offer a drink or a manager or something while I waited considering the fact that your booth just broke apart?  The entire incident was either completely ignored by staff, like it never happened or I was looked at like it was my fault.  I didn't even get so much as an apology!  I've been back a couple of times since then because the food is always good but I always sit in the dining room now which is sort of a shame because I actually like the bar atmosphere better.    Luckily for me though, their menu is online and they offer take out.  Unfortunately, they have the hostess answering those phone calls and since she's not a server, she doesn't have a lot of knowledge about the menu.  When I asked for a total, I was put on hold for a couple of minutes.  She finally came back and I asked how long and was put on hold again so she could go ask the kitchen.  She was quite rude about it, like I was bothering her.  Bottom line: Max's *is* the best place for German food in Pittsburgh, hands down.  But, the food is the only thing you're going for.  The staff could use some help on customer service.",

Her profanity-laden discussion with her dining partners was so bad that for the first time in my life, I turned around and asked a fellow restaurant patron to take the volume down a few notches.

So imagine my dismay when we tried brunch there today, and they gave me a botulism-filled bottle of ketchup that exploded black crud all over my shirt.  Then, they didn't even do anything to make it up to me.  The brunch was also very sub-standard; everything was cold.  Not even the potato pancakes tasted good.  I've had better meals at the complimentary continental buffet at the Holiday Inn.  But perhaps part of the meal was also tainted by the fact that I couldn't get the thought of their negligence for food contamination out of my head.

    "text": "Despite living in PIttsburgh for most of my life, I've somehow managed to never eat at Max's Allegheny Tavern until recently.    My initial impression of the restaurant was positive - the place had an old neighborhood feel to it, a small crowd was drinking at the end of the antique hardwood bar, and the German murals on the walls made me crave an icy-cold German lager with a stout head of foam.  I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.  And I waited...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn't quite accurate.  Two employees came around - one to the end of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one greeted me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a \"what's going on here\" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.  Finally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great, I thought to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.  My first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: \"Uh-oh\".  The menu is huge with a number of \"slow-food\" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.  I ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.    Sadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.  My sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The \"bacon\" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, \"meat\".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.    Max's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, \"The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service\".  That's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.  If you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.    I'll never return.",

Max's Allegheny Tavern has been a shining star and a \"must\" for my Pittsburgh rotation of places to visit.  Years ago, when I worked on the Northside for Heinz, I spent many a rowdy Friday night here in the basement with factory workers.    What's there to say?  It's a Northside institution and always has a mixed crowd that is super cool and friendly.  The bartenders are friendly and manage to remember my name and drink choice even though I'm here only a few times a year.  My Friday nights here must have made quite an impression!  I love the decor here, dark wood paneling with lots of stained glass, and the downstairs bar is where the naughty people hang.  Jukebox and room for dancing.  The food is very homey and very reasonably priced.  The German nachos are always worth ordering, and they are smothered with Gouda cheese.  The spatzle is also a creamy indulgent treat.  And for those seeking the real Deutsch culinary experience, they have a large variety of sausages and schnitzels.  So it's a sausage factory in more ways than one.",

We tried it again for dinner just in case brunch wasn't their strong suit and it was even worse.

The food ranged from ok (soft pretzels, braised red cabbage, kielbasa) to frozen ok (Mrs T's fried Pierogies that they call potato pockets) to actually bad (German potato salad that seemed half rotten and resembled no German potato salad I've ever had and spatzle that was tasted like doughy flour).

Other cuisines from Europe, yes, but when it came to German cuisine I didn't think I would enjoy it as much as others.  Was I ever wrong and so glad I gave in.  I have been exploring more places in the city to enjoy a good meal.  Going on a bit of a worldly journey if you will.  Who knew the North Side had so much to offer?  Walking into Max's is like walking into two distinct establishes.  When you first walk in you are entering what feels like a pub.  High back booths and ample bar seating.  Most people seem to gravitate to the bar in this area and have a good time.  Then there is the seating area for the restaurant feel.  When you walk back here you feel as if you are walking into somebody's home.  A warm wallpaper lines the wall and unique pieces of furniture accent the walls.  Tables are crammed into every nook and cranny that affords some unique seating.  Once seated you area handed what looks like a newspaper but is in fact the menu.  This menu covers everything you would find in a German eatery.  It took me a while to go over it.  In the mean time we placed a drink order and scanned the menu.  Everything sounded great to try, but I honestly kept going back to one item: spatzle.  When I read the description of the Kase Spatzle, I was sold.  To me, basically, it's German mac n cheese.  I also got a salad with this.  The salad was simple yet a nice way to start this meal.  Nothing really special about it, but all the vegetables in it were fresh and crisp.  Now let's talk about that spatzle.  I had never had spatzle before and I have to ask myself why did I not have it until now.  I was in heaven.  Spatzle noodles are the bomb.  These noodles were amazing and swimming in a mixture of chicken broth and Gouda cheese.  They then top them with some buttered breadcrumbs and fresh parsley.  Every bite made my taste buds dance.  I can honestly say that there was nothing left on that plate when I finished.  And it hit the spot.  I can also honestly say that I do not remember what my better half got because I was too focused on my food.  So shame on me for not finding this place sooner.  I take full responsibility for that.",

Walking into Max's you get the old-time feel with the mid century architecture of the building and all the decor. The menus are fashioned after old newspaper articles from around the turn of the century and are not over-cluttered.   The food and the atmosphere are great for a group of people or even just yourself and your spouse. The food is authentic as you can get and comes out piping hot. You are greeted at your table with a basket of assorted breads, butter, pickled sauerkraut, and apple butter. The meals are always fabolous and service is very warm and friendly.   One of my favorite dishes to get is the Schnitzel Lichtenstein with potato pancakes and sauerkraut.   Overall great place with amazing food. If you are visiting Pittsburgh, definitely a place to go!",

    "text": "If you love authentic German food, you'll want to discover this hidden treasure in the North Side Deutschtown neighborhood. This is a real yinzer favorite (for the uninitiated I will translate from Pittsburghese- a yinzer is a Pittsburgh native).  It is a historic tavern and restaurant that has been here seemingly forever with the best German food in town. Come hungry and you'll leave stuffed. The generous portions are very reasonably priced and delicious. You may want to skip the appetizer because they will bring you a bread basket of fresh rolls with apple butter spread and sauerkraut. That's right, sauerkraut. Put in on your roll and enjoy. (Don't judge unless you try it.). The draft beer selection is good, with a nice variety of German or American specialty beers. I started with Kostrizter Swabler, a smooth deep dark caramel colored lager - delicious. I struggled with what entree to order, so the waitress suggested the sampler platter. Good call! You can pick one item from each of 3 columns along with 2 sides. I selected the Jager schnitzel, Schnitzel ALA Holstein, and Schnitzel Liechtenstein. (See my menu photos for descriptions). I was most intrigued by the ALA Holstein, veal  cutlet covered with a fried egg, anchovies and capers. This is a taste sensation that is not for the faint of heart. While it was excellent I'm glad I didn't get a full size portion, the sampler was sufficient. I would recommend it.  Next I moved on to the Liechtenstein. Veal cutlet, ham, cheese, and green olives. A very nice combination, delicious.  Finally, the Jager. This was my least favorite- thin sliced veal covered in mushroom sauce. The veal was rather dry, and the mustard sauce was okay but I think was sauerbraten sauce- sour.  For sides I got the red cabbage (delicious) and spatzel with sauce (there's that sauerbraten sauce again). Next time I'll skip the sauce and just go with the butter. There are several other sides to chose from too.  Ii didn't really save room for desert, but elected to get a nice strudel to take home. A scoop of vanilla ice cream topping wasn't going to travel well for the 1/2 hour ride home, so the waitress was kind enough to bring me a dish to eat it there.  So if you love German food, or want to try it, it doesn't get any better than Max's. Enjoy!",

Last time I was there I got the Peasant Platter; it's couple of different wursts, German potato salad and spatzle.  Everything was really good, and the price is right. I would recommend it this place to anyone, and make sure you get the German potato salad as aside.     Oh it's worth mentioning that the price is right on just about every item there. You won't spend a fortune on a good dinner here.",

    "text": "We Visited Max's Allegheny Tavern while in Pittsburgh with friends a couple of weeks ago. It's a lively, friendly neighborhood spot.  Before sitting down in the one of the homey dining rooms we hung out in the bar area to check out the beer offerings and partake of free and abundant popcorn.  I also got a chance to observe the steady flow of regulars stopping by to chat and drink in a spot that was clearly almost a second home to many of them.  The bartender was a real pro, and by the time we moved on to our table I felt like I'd known him for years.  Dinner was the way dinner with a group of friends is supposed to be -- fun and unhurried.  We ordered a round of appetizers and were able to spend time chatting without being rushed to order.  The food was classic American German fare, and I have to say I liked it a lot, even if things seemed to be a bit heavy on the salt (does anyone go to a German spot looking for low sodium offerings?).  The consensus was that the entrees were good but not great, with some not as warm as they should have been. Serving sizes were generous: by the time we finished the entrees no one around the table had enough capacity left to sample a dessert.  My verdict: Probably not the place to go if you're looking for gourmet cuisine.  But if you are in downtown Pittsburgh and seeking a place to have a good meal and a few beers with friends in a friendly spot, this is the place to go.",

I enjoy the area it is in even if it's not the greatest part of town. Parking on street was fairly easy to find right around the corner.   The inside was rather neat having that rustic/historic look to it. The menu has a history of the building written inside which is fascinating to read about. The food itself was OK. I loved the red cabbage as it had a healthy amount of sweetness to it. I also enjoyed the make your own omelet bar as that is one of my favorite brunch items! The other food ended up just being average at best. There were some pasta and sausage combinations as well as bacon and fruit. The fruit didn't look too great and I avoided that and the baked goods which sounded underwhelming.  Overall a neat experience to dine here. I wouldn't be opposed to coming back and trying out a regular weeknight dinner menu. I like the history part of the building and I think the historical decoration concept inside is neat.",

Its a bit pricey (~$15/person), but the quality and quantity is superb.  The service is pretty good.  The atmosphere has a nice feel to it, perhaps its the antiquity.. I love the cuckoo clock and tapestries they have.  Now, to the food: The bread they give you... with apple butter!! ... is very fresh and tasty.  Try not to fill up on it while waiting on your huge main course.. The Bavarian soft pretzels were warm and soft when we ordered them.  Also delicious.  The sampler platter is a great deal if you don't know yet what you like.  You get 3 entrees and the typical sides for ~$16.  My favorite, though, is the schnitzel liechtenstein, with sauerkraut and potato pancakes.  Fresh and delicious everytime.

It was Kay's pick, and she surprisingly threw the dart at Max's, a place I've forgotten exists.   Pickled herring is something I've had before; my Polish grandmother introduced it to me as a lad. Before we even arrived, I sleuthed the menu online and instantly knew that I wanted The Herring In Sour Cream as our appetizer.   The sour cream is just a blob laid on top of the pile of herring and serves to temper the herring's sugary flavor. The herring itself was so thick yet so delicate and exquisitely candied it had me...*ulp*...  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D0-vm1s5644o&s=4a28f6859792ceb69d30792c3da2fd1ab9d6445e05cb36c290c0c3ca49ec9e3b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=0-vm...</a>  A cornucopian assortment of somewhat stale rolls were included with apple butter and a sauerkraut relish, both of which would have tasted even better on hot dogs.   Also making for a fine frank fixin' was the Sweet and Sour Cabbage, a colorful take on the sauerkraut we all know and love. I had that along with their German Potato Salad (you get 2 sides with an entree). Max's potato salad tastes more like potatoes au gratin that anything you'd find in a deli, but it made for an errr...Acceptable accompaniment.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGkiuJg5HhtM&s=9dc341244a0fafec623c8c04df47eac8681b7f3fe1d517a33d21005f716bed40\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=Gkiu...</a>  And yes, the potatoes played the role that \"Ein Heller und ein Batzen\" does in the above song.

Wiener Schnitzel (the prime, naked Schnitzel), Schnitzel ala Holstein, and Schnitzel Royale would make up my trio. Each of them tasted like the thinnest and best boneless pork chops I've never had, despite the use of veal. Schnitzel ala Holstein is named after a count and is served with Gouda and a tomato slice. Schnitzel Royale comes topped with capers, anchovies, and a perfectly executed fried egg. The Holstein was the richest, the Royale the most pungently memorable. All of them came off as tender, crispy breakfast fare I had been missing out on for too long, but I can finally say beyond a doubt that Schnitzel is pure, risen splendour...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DUojVLi1x4ak&s=c68dbe681023ab62878edcab2be67b441ae78adecdd6702804bea44045200b95\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=UojV...</a>  For dessert it was Apple Strudel. Layered, flaky dough and a thermal filling involving the freshest of apples collaborated to create a pastry that succeeded with simple elegance.   P.S. Our server was brusque to a degree but warmed up to us once  we sang praises of the food.   P.P.S. The power went out for about five minutes as we dined. Uh-oh...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DXtBXcCsfytA&s=97fcb2a1106d4c416a694da1abedcbbeda1686c7c06a2e4059d57207c5c8097a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=XtBX...</a>",

As many schnitzels on the menu as you can imagine (my co-worker had schnitzel with an egg, anchovy and capers on top, if you can imagine).

I ordered a special, which apparently changes at weekly or monthly. The name slips my mind but I will describe it thus: homemade mac and cheese (not the processed powder stuff!) with mini shell pasta. Crumbled crackers topped this concoction that tastes eerily like my grandmother's. She is Italian by the way. The mac and cheese has a variety of 3 different sausages sliced: knackwurst, bratwurst, and Weisswurst. The portion was large! I had to take home about 1/3 of my meal. Maybe the breads and side salad filled me up. :) In my opinion, it was good but doesn't do well as a leftover.   My dessert consisted of German chocolate cake. I know, I know...how original. BUT I LOVE GERMAN CHOCOLATE CAKE!!!! And yes, I do know that German chocolate was created in America by a man with the last name of German...STILL LOVE IT!!!   I NEED to go back soon so I can try more of their food. One visit isn't enough. I had my sample and I want more!",

    "text": "Came here with a large group of friends for dinner. They were great about the reservation we made for 12 and had a nice table in its own little room waiting for us when we arrived. I had the Hefeweizen style beer, which was good but had a strange taste and aftertaste to it, but it wasn't so bad as I ordered a second one. For apps we had the  Bavarian nachos (not great by any means and actually very odd...and cold), the stuffed fried pretzel and the red cabbage with sausages. The red cabbage here is amazing, and the pretzel was fairly good with a honey mustard dipping sauce...but I guess its kind of hard to mess up something thrown into a deep fryer and stuffed with cheese. For our entrees I had their \"famous\" potato pancake Reuben with sides of red cabbage (couldn't get enough!) and their house German potato salad - also very tasty. Fiance had potato pancakes, spatzel with cheese sauce and sausages. The spatzel was not in as a creamy a cheese sauce as I would have hoped - it was a bit oliy, not so much creamy. We were both a little underwhelmed sans the cabbage with the entire meal. I hate to say it - but I have had better authentic German style food at church potlucks and even Hofbrahaus (in a comparison to the beers at Hofbrahaus - these did just not stack up for me). I would give MAT another go round to try some of their other offerings - their schnitzels looked pretty good!",

    "text": "We (my fiance and I) went out for a pseudo-couples' date with our good friends, Sara and Thom, to Max's to introduce them to some of the most authentic German food in da Burgh. Where most people associate Hofbrauhaus with the ultimate German beer-hall experience, I prefer Max's for the quieter, less raucous environs. (At least when it's not Oktoberfest)  We'd been there once before and immediately fell in love with the place. I (still) keep raving about the Sausage and Cheese platter. They've got some good Gouda. The Potato Pockets (pierogies) were OK -- I'd take some Pierogies Plus or Forgotten Taste over Max's, but that's just me.  The spaetzel was to die for, however. It's like a German Mac n' Cheese. And boy, do I love me some Mac n' Cheese. It literally melts in your mouth with its' ooey-gooey-ness.  Drink-wise, I tried their German lager and Thom tried the sampler. Thom is a beer enthusiast. For around eight bucks, you get a GOOD amount of beers to try -- they are not some dinky little shot glass samples, either. Thom had some trouble near the end finishing it...it was so much beer. Bob had a Captain and ginger-ale...in a king-size goblet. Goblets are the ONLY way to serve adult bevvies.  For dinner, I had the pork loin over an apple-raisin gravy/bread concoction. The pork loin was flavorful and tender, and quite delicious. Sara had the sauerbraten and seemed to enjoy it. Bob's burger was ginormous and looked extra tasty.  We finished it off with the Apple Fritters. Now, these fritters aren't for the faint of heart. And they aren't your average dinky small sized portions, either. You get two huge deep fried apple fritters, covered in vanilla ice cream. One person CANNOT eat the whole serving. You must, I repeat MUST share them. If you attempt to eat the whole plate yourself, you will have flavor explosion, followed by severe heartburn. But damn, are they GOOD.  Our visit ended up totaling 2 hours. One thing, though...please fix your outdoor sign. Usually it shines out like a red and blue beacon in the night for people to find their way there, but on Wednesday, it was out. Driving there, I got confused on where it exactly was (but I had a general idea, as I had been there before.).",

Most of the mains can be recommended without reservation....last night I had roasted pork with dressing and gravy.  It was deliscious!    As for sides....I ALWAYS have potato pancakes and sweet and sour cabbage.  (Because of my eastern european background I am partial to both cabbage and potatoes.   Do not be afraid of the cabbage unless you dislike sour!   We didn't have dessert, but did have beer and drinks.   They have a nice selection.  My only complaint was that the food was slow to come out.   It was a busy Friday night and I wasn't going anywhere so I had anover beer.   No big problem.

All appetizers are  $2.99 during happy hour so we went with the Potato pockets which were perogies in my book. They were crispy and creamy, and topped with fried onions. They also had a side of french onion sour cream. Pretty tasty stuff! Plus they gave you so many I could have filled up just on the app. I ordered the Bell's Oberon while my dining partner ordered the sampler. I have to say that she wasn't that impressed with the brew. \"Dirty pipes\" and I quote. I had the same taste from my order so I focused on the food.  We both ended up ordering Max's Goulash that was suggested by another Yelper! You can't go wrong when you have that recommendation. This is not our small town neighborhood goulash made from egg noodles and a mix with ground beef. The noodles in this feast were homemade and chunky, piled high with a peppery meaty sauce infused with fall off the fork beef, carrots, peas, and tiny pearl onions. If you remember yesterday was a cold, rainy, gloomy day. This was real comfort and I had to take it to go. Rain is still in the forecast so leftovers will be grand!",

Cold kielbasi and sauerkraut is a turn off even though it would be great if it was warmer.  The chef that makes the eggs and omelets to order is really good and the sausage is the best. The bacon and the chicken needs to be cooked a little longer as they are always half raw. So much of what they have would be good if it was kept at least warm. Since they have it in chaffing dishes, I've found that the food comes out cold from the kitchen. Makes you wonder just how safe the kitchen is.",

I had Max's Goulash, which said it came with spaetzle, but it is piled in the bottom of the bowl and not on the side, which was okay. The goulash was too vinegary for my tastes, but it was okay.

Combined, the diner, whether they are visitors or not, feel like they've experienced a staple of Pittsburgh locals. Thus with this wurst and beer combo, arguably, one of the most famous Pittsburgh dishes is now at your fingertips. Furthermore, if you want to take the next step in your Pittsburgh eating experience, Max's again has you covered with the Hasenpfeffer, or rabbit dish. An ode to the deep German roots of Pittsburgh's North Side, this traditionally rural, hunter's dish is served at Max's breaded and with gravy on top and with two sides: this reviewer recommends potato pancakes, spatzle, or substitute the einlauf soup, which goes well with the dark pumpernickel bread served table side. While the meat is thick and tender, the breading conceals the possibility of herbs and spices, which if they do exist, cannot be detected. Additionally, the Hasenpfeffer is a little pricey since you pay for the uniqueness; it is often only a dinner item as well. Finally, an Iron City Beer may be the best way to cap off a Pittsburgh North Side German dining experience at Max's bar: a place where many a long hard day has been passed knocking back a cold one. Cheers and enjoy!",

    "text": "Why you should trust my review: I am German. I've been to Germany. I LOVE German food. And German beer.   The bar is awesome. Wish we had more time just to chill and drink. But our waitress was awesome, attentive and knowledgeable! Order a REAL beer. Something on tap from Germany. (If not, I'll give you dirty looks from behind my coffee cup.)  What you should order: The Sampler Platter. Pick three amazing entrees, two awesome sides. Brilliant for $16.95... best deal on the menu. And if they have a meatball appetizer you want this. You do.   So which entrees:   - Schnitzel. Whichever one you're drooling over. Personally Jager Schnitzel is always best because God blessed the world when he made mushrooms, and man praised God by making mushroom sauce.  - Leberkase. Wow. This was fantastic. It's like a cross between liverwurst (but NOT made with liver) and a meatloaf. Fantastisch.  - Weisswurst. It was good. I've had better and yes I know its a German faux pas to have weisswurst at any other time of day than a midmorning snack... however. it was still yummy and I happily moaned with each bite i consumed with mustard.  So which sides:   - Spaetzle! Buttery goodness. Never had it or heard of it? Think little dumplings. In butter. Es ist wunderbar.  - Sauerkraut... they make theirs with sausage. what?! Ja... mmmmm.  - Potato Pancakes. You order these with applesauce. you hear me? applesauce.  What to avoid... that's pretty harsh but they lost a star for a reason:  - German Potato Salad was too sweet and soupy. My great grandma's recipe puts this to shame.  - IF you don't like mustard (weirdo) the Sauerbraten has a mustard sauce. I like it, but others don't. You've been warned.  We walked here from the ballpark... took about 15 minutes. Worth the walk both ways and they treated us well despite me wearing a Cardinals shirt in a foreign land.  Danke!",

The omelet station is standard (no egg whites for you health-nuts) and heavenly pastries will always await you along with potato pancakes.  I'm not in love with their potato pancakes, but being that Max's specializes in German food, you've got to try at least one with their homemade applesauce.  Some of my rotating favorites on the buffet include red cabbage, Eggs Benedict, and the Farmer's Breakfast.  You can order off the menu during brunch if you aren't in mood to gorge yourself on the buffet.  No drinks included with the buffet :( but you can order them, of course.  I love the decor at Max's - it's an old house, and much of the furniture looks like it was in this house and just remained when it converted to a restaurant.  Max's location in Old Deutschtown on the North Side fits it perfectly.  They even offer a shuttle to Heinz Field on Steeler game days (small fee applies).",

We ordered the potato skins app. And tho it took a little too long to get to the table it was worth the wait. We were enjoying the ambiance and decor of this great old building. The skins were perfect. Gouda cheese with nice crisp bacon and chives. So delicious!  We like to order so that we can share with each other. My husband loves potato pancakes so he got the PP Reuben. The Pot. Cakes were bland but a little S&P fixed that up. Tender corned beef and the slaw was a perfect side.  I chose the Bavarian Club. Never before tasted braunsweiger. It was so delicious I didn't want to share...but I did.  I had to try the sauerkraut for a side. And it was fantastic with chunks of pork mixed in!  I can't believe we managed to eat everything even the potato skins. But it was all so delicious we couldn't stop.  Can't wait to go back. I have to try the spatzle and the goulash!!",

We had a party of 6 going for a 7:30 dinner on a Thursday.   Bigger parties tend to chat a little more and take longer in my experience. I felt like they were sort of rushing us out. That might be because they closed the dining room door and started vacuuming the front bar room while we were still finishing up our dinner. I'm not sure if anyone was eating out there but I'm very happy we weren't because it seems really gross to me to vacuum around food. This was around 9:15 and I'm pretty sure they serve until 10.   Besides that, our service was good and so was the food. We all split the stuffed pretzels and potato skins as an appetizer. The pretzels are delicious, I could have eaten them all myself! Deep-fried and stuffed with cheese, yummy!   I ordered the Chicken Viennese and was pleased with my meal. It came with a choice of two sides and I went with a delicious sweet potato casserole and my favorite thing of the night: POTATO PANCAKES. I prefer sour cream, but you can also get applesauce. Yum yum yum get lots of potato pancakes! The chicken was delicious and was served over spaetzel, which was just ok. I've had the kase spaetzel there before which is served in a cheese sauce and much better than the regular.   There was a variety of entrees ordered from sausage platters to wiener schnitzel and everyone seemed pleased with their meals. You get a lot for your money and I'll never turn down a chance to eat potato pancakes!",

The kase spaetzle however was noteworthy and delicious. It was smothered in gouda cheese sauce and I love me some gouda! I ate it all and I would have licked the plate if it were socially acceptable.   As for the environment, the restaurant is housed in what looks like what might of used to be a house back in the day. It had lots of little dining rooms. The decor was kind of outdated, but I think that's what you'd expect and it's part of the charm. The tables were spaced a little too close for my liking, but it was tolerable.   Overall, I'd go back if invited, but I don't know if I'd go again on my own.",

Homemade honey mustard, gouda, Swiss, and the best kielbasa we've ever had the pleasure to bite into. Just as we're polishing off our plate and rubbing our full stomachs, our entrees came.   The schnitzel was to die for, as was the rabbit, both smothered in homemade mushroom gravy. The sauerkraut was a perfect combination of savory and acidic.

The inside is pretty cool, it's all original, has a nice tile floor. The hostess who greeted us was very nice, hooray for that. The Business supposedly started in 1890? There is still a lot of the original Decour in the building. The menu is huge, a very lot to choose from. My husband got the German beer sampler, I loved all four. I ordered a glass of red wine, not much to choose from, The choices were pretty bad. Although a bottle of wine, they had more of a nicer selection. They have Foxhorn wine on their wine menu. Yuck. I got the pot roast sandwich, my choice of side was coleslaw. My husband got the sauerbraten and his choices of sides were warm German potato salad and spatzle.  I really like the flavor of the sauce on his entree. All was OK, our server was polite. The prices were very reasonable. Cocktails and desserts were very low-priced. I had the German chocolate cake for dessert, the picture looks amazing, the cake was not so amazing. Perhaps they do not make it there, it kind of tasted like a frozen product. My husband had the Apple strudel, I liked it a lot, although he was disappointed that it was microwaved and not baked in the oven to warm it up. I would go back to try more food from their menu, I saw loaded potato skins at the table next to us, definitely would order those as a meal. My husband says to give the restaurant four stars, he has spent time in Germany and thought that the food was pretty good.",

    "text": "We used Max's to cater a company event, and couldn't be happier! The staff was personable and patient with me as I worked to pick out an appropriate menu, and went so far as to make recommendations. What a relief, after dealing with so many pushy and aloof companies!   Despite the snowstorm that was taking place, a friendly staff member helped us load our food up to be taken to the event, taking extra care that nothing would move around once we started driving.   Oh, and of course the food was great (and very reasonably priced). We had kielbasa, kraut, wings, spaetzl, and potato pancakes - all of it was great. Would recommend to anyone looking for take out catering.",

I had the Roasted Loin of Pork Stubenkuchen Style with German Style Potato Salad, and Sauerkraut. Everything was really good. The Pork was delicious and that mushroom gravy that they put on it was nothing short of amazing. I want a whole bucket of the stuff to put on everything. The Sauerkraut was interesting featuring shredded pork mixed in. The german potato salad was good but was pretty much what I expected.   Their draft  beer Selection left a little bit to be desired but featured 5-8 beers many of them popular german style beers.   I got a good idea what this place is all about and I have to say that I will be back for more.",

Rather they just serve really good authentic German food, with a small selection of imported German beer. Wunderbar!",

    "text": "I really thought I'd never be back.  The goulash I had was so so gross.  But then,  was roped in by some friends who were doing a Sunday brunch book club.  Of course I couldn't miss out on tantalizing conversation... so I obliged.    I really had no clue what they offered for brunch options, but quickly learned they have a a pretty decent size brunch buffet.  I'm not below buffets at all, it's the fat kid in me!  Most things still looked a little questionable to me, but I went for the big ticket items.  Make your own omelets, potato pancakes and dessert.  I'd hit up the buffet again, but still be hasty to check out the regular menu again.    The omelet was made right in front of you, so I added cheese, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes and onions.  I was super excited about it because it was the size of a football.  Sadly, it was pretty tasteless.  I don't think they added any salt or pepper to the egg mix, so it came out really bland, despite loading up on ingredients.    But the potato pancakes... I could survive on them forever.  They were amazeballs!  Add some sour cream and I was in potato patch heaven!  I had to keep myself from getting more because of the other thing I loaded up on... dessert.    The desserts looked unassuming, but they were also awesome.  I had a smattering of delectable bites.  The scones were so moist and tasty.  I had to stop myself from taking more than 20.  I also had some carrot cake, brownies, cookies among other things I inhaled and didn't pay attention too.  Should I be embarrassed?  Probably.  But I don't care because it was darn good!",

The Thunderbolt is considered one of the best rollercoasters in the country.  It's not the fastest, it's old, it doesn't have the biggest drops or flip you upside-down.  And yet it's great.  It's classic.  This is Max's Allegheny Tavern.  I'm sure there's better German food with cuter waitresses somewhere out there that doesn't have the decor aesthetics of your grandma's living room.  But who cares.  This place is just right.  Final note, I can't speak for the brunch buffet.  I went in there for the buffet once and decided that my money would be better spent on the menu.",

    "text": "After hearing Hofbrauhaus-haters say that Max's Allegheny Tavern is the only place to go in Pittsburgh for German food, my husband and I decided to finally try the restaurant this afternoon.  We were seated in little booths right next to the bar. They were cozy, but the seats reminded me of old fashioned church pews. Our waitress soon brought us a little basket of four rolls with butter, sauerkraut relish, and apple butter. Though I liked the different varieties of bread, it was nothing special. The relish and apple butter were a nice touch though.  Our waitress was busy with both waiting tables and tending the bar, but she managed to check on us pretty frequently. Our food also came out relatively promptly. I order the Wiener Schnitzel with Potato Pancakes and Spatzle on the side. The Wiener Schnitzel was amazing -- by far the best I've ever had! The veal was tender and the fried surface was perfectly crispy. However, the sides sadly did not match this main dish. The Potato Pancakes were oddly bitter, and I did not enjoy them with either the sour cream or applesauce. I only ate two or three bites and completely stopped eating them. (I must add that Hofbrauhaus's potato pancakes are delicious and something that I order every time that I go there.) I also did not enjoy the Spatzle, but I am accustomed to eating cheese Spatzle.... So I may be reviewing this harshly since I'm just not used to plain Spatzle, but in my opinion, it was terribly bland and watery.  Overall, Max's Allegheny Tavern served one incredible item (Wiener Schnitzel), but everything else was merely mediocre. Because of this, I really don't plan on returning to the restaurant again any time soon. I'll be sticking with the fun environment and overall good food at Hofbrauhaus, actually.",
