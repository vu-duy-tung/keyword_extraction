There must be 9 or 10, maybe more, types of wings with cajun, bbg, honey bbq, Hey Mon jamaican, and more.  Was with a friend who likes the wraps and jamaican wings.  Tried the hot bbq wings...they were good.  Also had some fries, that look to be fresh cut on the premises.   They do delivery to the area.",

This need a remodel for the inside of he building also it's embarrassing.

The Portions are huge and I am always stuffed. The Prices are very reasonable as well.  BUT - if you are going to take the wings to go, make sure you have somewhere to dispose of everything afterwards, otherwise your place will reek of the smell.  Also they are not too flexible on the menu, I wanted a couple of flavors - and I wasn't ordering a small portion and was told I could only have one flavor, but it is their place, so play by their rules or there is other options.  If you want to support a local family owned business you can't go wrong.",

I had the lemon pepper chicken wings and the Mr. had mild buffalo then we ordered the ranch and cheese fries and an order of the funnel fries.  The portions are huge!  One side of fries could easily be split four ways. They put way too much seasoning on the fries and my lemon pepper wings. To the point they weren't even edible.  So disappointed!  They also forgot our cheese for the fries.  The mild wings and blue cheese were right on point though!  The funnel fries with Hershey's chocolate for dipping were delicious as well!

    "text": "I have been hearing about Wiggy's salads for a while at work and I finally decided to try it last night, my first time. I placed my order for a steak salad over the phone with a young man who was very nice. When I picked up my salad, it was around 8:30pm and people were still coming in to pick up their orders. I hadn't eaten all day and I had a long drive ahead of me so I decided to at least eat the french fries on my salad.. who likes cold french fries? I sat down and tasted the fries, which were cut fresh and tasted great. The homemade ranch dressing was very good as well. I noticed that the steak had black ash falling off if it so I tasted a piece and all I could taste was the burn. I was bummed because I didnt want my first experience at Wiggy's to be this bad. I took my salad up to the counter and the young man asked me what was wrong. I told him the steak was burned and he looked extremely annoyed and did not apologize or say anything other than \"Guess I'll make you another one\" then he stomped off. He was so rude that it was off-putting. But, I figured he had a bad day. I took a few dollars out of my purse to tip them for remaking my salad. I got up and threw the cup of ranch dressing away. I ate half of it with my fries and the rest had gotten warm while I was waiting for them to re-make my steak. I sat there another 15 minutes waiting. While I was waiting, I heard one of the other guys who was working there arguing with the rude cook about having to re-make the steak that he burnt to a crisp. He was complaining about it and I think the nice guy who took my order was telling him to suck it up. Anyway, thankfully, the rude cook did not bring out the salad. It was someone else. Unfortunately, all he re-made was the steak. So, I was staring at a steak thrown on top of lettuce without the fries or the cheese. I already threw the dressing out .. at this point, I felt like I was in a Seinfeld episode. I was looking at steak and lettuce, minus everything else. I guess I was expected to eat what was left . It was really bad. If anyone was reviewing this incident, I think they would be horrified. If you burn the steak in a steak salad, you re-make the entire salad for the customer. You would think that's common sense, but apparently not?",

The food comes out pretty quickly and the prices are reasonable.  The place itself, isn't anything fancy or nice. Just a seat and a table. Don't expect any atmosphere, which is no big deal.  What I don't like about Wiggies is the lack of ventilation. YOU WILL SMELL LIKE WINGS! If that doesn't bother you, you'll be fine. But unfortunately, I only go there if I know I don't have to be anywhere important. I avoid this place for lunch because I simply don't like smelling like a grease pit in my work clothes.

Wiggys... is not the best... but if somone asked me to pick one place to eat wings regularly it is wiggys every time.   The price, variety,  and consistency wins me over.  There are better wings... but when it is 2 dollars a wing, you can keep it.  There are wing places that are the same price, but your choices are bbq and mild and thats it.  I could eat here everyday for a month and get a different flavor each time.  This is what they do and they do it well.  If you dont like wings... they have a whole menu to provide you without losing the spacial designation of \"wing place\".  Sweet asian chili wings and buffalo chips... tears of joy.",

The problem I had with this place is that they don't have a very accommodating menu and are not very accomodating themselves.  For instance, I like to order wings and would love to have fries with it.  But an order of fries there is for a group of 2 or more and like $4.  I asked them if I could just have a single order of fries and they said no.  Another example is they have a wing day ($.40 wings, eat in only).  I called to order wings because sometimes it can take a while to get your food, expecially if there is a line.  Even though I am a regular there, they wouldn't take my order ahead of time.  Refused.   So, their food gets a 5, their ownership gets a 1, overall they get a 3.",

This has become one of our top two wing places, ever. The wings are great size and crispy with any of the sauces or seasonings being well covered! Great pricing for the quality and over food experience. My only suggestion would be to change to a new location or vamp the current one; it'd be nice to feel comfortable staying and eating. The current venue feels too...cafeteria like and leaves a lot to be desired. There's a fine balance between laid back and cool verse cheap; this walks slightly on the cheap side, underselling it's great food!! We've tried various other items, none has disappointed!",

There is no limit on the number of wings or number of sauces you choose (basically you could order one of every flavor if you'd like---- but dont lol) The wings arent jumbo but the number of sauces that they offer and the freedom of choosing your amount makes up for it. Their fries are fresh cut so that is also a plus.  Last night my bf ordered 5 buffalo garlic parm & 5 honey bbq. Since i wasnt sure if id finish them (& you cant take them with you) i only ordered 3 teriaki w/ sesame seeds which was actually the perfect amount.  We ordered a large fry (4 potatoes) and couldnt finish them! The ranch was awesome and they gave you a large amount for 75cents.  Deff worth a wing night experience. The workers are super kind.",

It was cooked fine. The tomato paste out of the can taste was just too much to bear though.  Had plenty of fresh cut fries with it.  Those were better than most fries.",

I love their Buffalo Mild and Buffalo Cajun wings, but that doesn't touch the tip of how many choices they have.  Their portions are huge when it comes to fries and salads.  The wings are hot and juicy and have plenty of sauce.  You can ask them to make any flavor you want, but they have most of the bases covered.  They have excellent ranch by the way.  Check out their wing nights on Wednesdays and Saturdays!  Keep up the great work!",

The meat is a slab of grilled sirloin! No mystery meat here. It's so good. Probably my favorite steak hoagie in Pittsburgh. It's pretty big and comes with above average fries. The ranch dressing is delicious too. I've always had good interactions with the staff and typically call my orders in for pickup without any issue. Their buffalo chicken wraps are pretty fantastic too. So if you're there and want to try something other than wings, you'll leave with a full belly of deliciousness.",

I agree with another poster, the wings are the best in town! They are big and crispy!!!!! People there are always very nice. Kind of a dingy old looking place that kind of makes you feel like you are in the 80's with a lot of their old school Pittsburgh photo's but I think that gives it a lot of it's charm. If you are in the Ingram, Crafton, Greentree, and Carnegie area and want a quick bite, this place is a must! GREAT FOOD!",

Nothing fancy but a great wing place. Very clean and neat.  Very busy.... Seems like a lot of take out since they don't serve beer and only have a small TV.  We tried 5 flavors today. My favorite was the Buffalo Garlic Parm..... Delicious!!! Also had; Mild & Hot Buffalo, Teriyaki, and Supersonic (my son's favorite. I would also recommend Cajun French Fries..... Good stuff. Save room for funnel cake French Fries with chocolate dipping sauce..... Amazing!!! Overall a must stop if you  are in the Pittsburgh area.",

I preferred the Sweet Chili, as it had a small kick that went along with the sweetness. Chipotle BBQ would have been better if it had some spiciness in the sauce, as the name implied. The wings are all a very nice size and have a lot of meat on the bones. Skin is crispy, but the sauce is kind of just poured on top and doesn't really stick. So you have to dip the wing into the extra sauce to cover the whole thing. Seating is limited too, so if you're dining in, be prepared to have to wait for a seat. Overall, a popular place for wings and you get pretty great quality wings for a cheaper price. Also the location is perfect to walk over to the bowling alley for an after dinner activity.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I randomly went to Wiggy's last night while we were out. We had no intentions of going out to eat but we got sort of hungry and it happened to be close by. We've walked by a handful of time while stopping in the wine and spirits next door but never really think to try it.  I'm not a huge wing person so I lucked out when I saw they had boneless wings. They have about 30-40 wing flavors if I had to estimate. All of which sounded delicious. Being that it was our first time we wanted to go somewhat basic just to scope it out. I've had terrible buffalo sauces so believe it or not that alone can give me all the information I need to know about a place. We got one order of buffalo mild and one of the honey bbq.   Our wings came out covered in sauce which was already a great sign. I hate food that isn't saucy enough. Sauce gives food flavor so let's not be stingy. We absolutely loved the buffalo wings. I will say for a mild buffalo it had some heat so depending on you heat tolerance be mindful of that. The bbq however wasn't my favorite. It was very bland in my opinion and the sauce was thick. Almost \"goopy\" if that's even a word.   In addition to the wings we got a order of Mac n cheese bites and spicy fried pickles. The Mac n cheese bites were every bit as amazing as I expected. The fried pickles however were not. Far too much breading on them and they weren't spicy at all. All the breading took away from the taste of the pickle.  All in all I would recommend Wiggy's to someone who enjoys wings. The actual wings looked a lot better than the boneless. Even if you aren't a wings person they have plenty of appetizers, salads, and sandwiches as well. We will definitely be back to try some of the other wing flavors!",

I was surprised to see how packed it was on a Wednesday night, I had to wait around 10 mins to get a seat.

That wasn't their fault because it was busy. We finally got a table and my friend pointed out that a table of boys who came in only about 20 or so minutes ago got their food and we still had yet to get ours. Keep in mind we ordered 18 wings all together, one flavor each. After another table got their food I went up and asked about the wait, telling the owner that it's been 40 minutes which wasn't True, it had been a lot longer at that point. She proceeded to tell me our food was coming and that they don't even start your food until you're seated. Even though there were no seats available and nobody bothered to explain this to us. We just decided to ask for our money back. The woman that was serving the food asked if I was serious and proceeded to say \"Are you fucking kidding me.\" I explained it had been a whole hour since we arrived and placed our order. The owner asked me if I seen how busy they were which would have been understandable if other people that had come in a whole 40 minutes after us hadn't received their food. Who I'm assuming was the cook told the owner to give us our money back. Afterwards he told us not to come back. I told him he was guaranteed that we wouldn't be coming back.  I can't help but to feel it was a case of discrimination for the fact that all the tables with black women were serviced after everyone else. There were women that had been there before my friend and I even came, they sat down before us and somehow received their food later than a table full of white boys and a father and his white son. These tables didn't place a small order either.  This was my first time actually ordering there on a wing night and even though I've had pleasant service in the past, you guys have lost a customer. It's disgusting how we were treated. Get better staff and better communication skills and some manners. If I could give a zero, I would.",

    "text": "I was actually really surprised that this place had such variety of wings!! They had a lot of flavors to choose from and the prices were pretty reasonable. We got take out for 32 wings in which you were allowed to pick two flavors. We got the Jamaican Jerk and the sweet chili. We also got an order of cajon fries. The wings smelled so delicious that it filled the scent in my car for a week! I really did like both flavors and also the cajun fries which had a generous portion. The Jamaican jerk was a dry rub which I liked and the sweet chili tasted like duck sauce with flakes of chili peppers. The wings are not that big but just a decent size. The fries were really good as they had just made them. The only downside to take out was that the food was so hot that it had burned through the foam container.   The place itself is clean and there are plenty of sitting area. While waiting, they even had arcade games in which you can play. I would definitely go back for wings! My order actually didn't take too long. We waited for probably 15 minutes or so which wasn't too bad.   NOTE: $0.50 wings on Wednesday and Saturday for dine in only.",

The fries were excellent, and a HUGE portion!  Service was good, price was reasonable as well. We'll probably be back, just ordering a different sandwich next time :)",
