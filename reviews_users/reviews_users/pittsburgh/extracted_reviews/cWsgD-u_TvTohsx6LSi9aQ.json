It had been about a year and I thought maybe they cleaned up their act. My mistake. I ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza and took it to go, I opened my box and took a couple bites then  noticed something moving underneath the parchment paper in the box. There was a small roach in the box with my pizza!   I took the box back and respectfully approached a waitress not near any other customers so that I didn't make a scene. I asked for my money back and let them know there was a roach still alive in my pizza box. I got no apology! It was almost as if I inconvenienced them by bringing it back.   DO NOT EAT HERE !!!!",

    "text": "Bar review here since \"Bar\" isn't listed.  This is the bar attached to the pizza joint.   I LOVE \"dive\" bars so I wanted to love this place, but I wasn't feeling everything.  AMAZING prices for the city. $6 for a double jack and coke?  Yes,  please! And they are strong.     Service is hit and miss.  Staff seems acquainted to a smaller amount of people so a full bar makes them nervous. We got most drinks at the bar but the bartender came around once to our table. And then she left the bar for like 10 minutes...that seemed a bit strange. Perhaps a bar waitress would be beneficial. We probably would have ordered food if someone asked us if we'd like to order.   Since we couldn't order food, I have no comments on that. :(  Location is down an alley way. A bit foreboding but I guess that's what you get at an inner-city dive bar. Seems to be a hangout for locals and after-work types. Pretty small area but lots of tables. Get there early to snag one because you won't have any available if you wait til 5:15 PM on a Friday. Bathrooms are down a set of stairs in the pizza joint. Felt like descending a mountain but maybe that was the booze. Also, the stalls are on a platform which made my 6'0\" frame have to stoop to get in. Bathroom = shady.   While I would go back, my husband stated he wouldn't. I didn't get the vibe he did but he usually can read places pretty well so I'll probably listen to his opinion on this one. But if you want a cheap drink, this is your spot in the city.",

I usually get a slice of pizza and today I added in a side of meatballs. I do want to add you won't be paying a fortune at this place.

    "text": "So I started a new job downtown (I moved from NYC during the summer), and some coworkers took me here just last week for lunch.  Since the move from NY, I'd been really craving some quality, New York-style pizza, and hadn't had a ton of luck finding any (although the search introduced me to some excellent \"Pittsburgh-style\" pizza joints, so I'm not complaining.)    Villa Reale really came through.  I loved that you could order a slice with basically whatever toppings you wanted (I'm used to being at the mercy of whatever \"slice\" pie has been languishing under a heat lamp for 3 hours).  I ordered a pepperoni and sausage slice, and the small feast that was presented to me did not disappoint.  The slice was huge, the pepperoni crispy, the sauce really balanced (not too sweet, not too garlicy), the cheese fresh and delicious and the crust...oh man...thin and crisp on the outside, pillowy soft on the inside.  One slice was perfect to fill me up for lunch, too.    Full disclosure: while the wait staff is so friendly, they do get overwhelmingly busy at lunch.  We went to the place at 11:00 so we could sit at a table (if you want to dine-in and order a slice during lunch, you can only sit at the counter, not a table, after 11:30) and by 11:30 the place was standing room only.  My coworkers informed me that somehow, their pizzas are even better when ordered by the pie (hard for me to fathom) and also that their hoagies are delicious, so I'm sure I'll be trying one of those next time.    It's not the most inexpensive pizza joint downtown (I think my slice ended up being $4-$4.50) but if you're a recovering Noo Yawker like me looking to fulfill some culinary nostalgia, this is your place.",

Also if u just want a slice or two they put exactly that in the oven. They don't make whole pies and slice them up for individual slice orders. Which makes the wait even longer. Also the girls working the register are also the waitresses, so there's often no one at the register to take your order. Also I watched the only guy who does the pizzas burn 2 pies because he was too busy running his mouth. Once u get your food, assuming it's correct, it's good, but good luck with that",

While our tastes may vary as we age, ultimately we are on a quest to recapture that first great pizza taste.   Villa Reale is the place of my first great pizza memory (groan if you may but it's True). Growing up in Latrobe I had become accustomed to mediocre, chain pizza. Not until I was about 12 did I get my first taste of super thin, floppy, extra cheesy, greasier than normal pizza. This was the stuff I dreamed of. My dad took me here prior to my first ever Pens game. The Villa holds a soft spot in his heart as well due to the many many post work nights he spent here slugging beers and eating pizza with friends.   Fast forward 13 years and now I am the one working downtown, slugging beers and eating post work pizza. Unfortunately though, Villa Reale has become so expensive that treating it as a weekly stop is a bit unreasonable. While the pizza is still super thin, floppy, extra cheesy, greasier than normal, I have trouble paying $15 for a slice of pepperoni, a coke, and a side salad. On another occasion my dad requested to come here as his payment for helping me move. A medium calzone, a slice of pepperoni, and two cokes ran me $35.   Villa Reale, please come to your senses and adjust your prices. While you played a significant role in my childhood, you are pricing yourself out of my adulthood.",

    "text": "I was really impressed with this place! I found out about it through the Ritual app and I ordered 2 slices. I am PICKY when it comes to pizza having come from the eastern side of the state where we're spoiled with NY style. So when I say this pizza is good, it says something.   The slices were HUGE and everything was perfect. The sauce was delicious and they weren't shy about the amount they put on. The cheese was also the perfect amount. Too much cheese on a pizza (I might be alone with this statement) is overwhelming.  Their fries were iffy. Tasted like they haven't changed the oil in a while or something. However, I don't expect top notch fries from a pizza place.   I'll def be back!",

It did not disappoint,  my husband and I split an antipasto salad which was large and delicious. We both had a slice of pizza and it was delicious- very large slices and very delicious. We both would recommend this little spot! Service was excellent too.",

So if you go there from 11:30-2:00 for slices and the 6-8 seats at the bar are taken and you sit at a table, they won't serve you slices. It's completely ridiculous. They're always packed at lunch so don't expect to get slices unless it's to go or you show up at 11.",

No offer to remove/discount it. NOTHING.  When going to pay at the counter, we once again said something - and she completely overlooked it.

I think there were a ton of people in the back room area however the dining room was pretty empty and quiet. No one greeted us, despite making eye contact with us, and we had to awkwardly seat ourselves before a woman came to our table with silverware and menus. She was nice and polite but the service was rather slow even though we were practically the only customers there. It was nice because it was quiet and had pretty lighting, but the dining area definitely wasn't very clean.  I ordered an Italian hoagie, which was good, but not anything spectacular or out of the ordinary. Prices weren't bad for the hoagies but the pizza slices were kinda pricey. So overall, the food was good but the service and cleanliness definitely could use some improvement.",

Was spoken to in a rude tone all night by the one server who was working. Food was ordered and sat in the cooking window for several minutes before having to ask if we could have our food. All vegetables on pizza were canned and watered down the pizza. Garlic bread was very burnt and when asked to remake was told \"it was not that bad\". Several issues with etiquette as we were constantly wondering if she was being serious. Personally enjoyed my salad and ravioli as portions are moderately large here. Calzone was huge and would feed 2 people well, although asked for a box and was never give one. Sounds like an average place for lunch, just be ready for a wait.",
