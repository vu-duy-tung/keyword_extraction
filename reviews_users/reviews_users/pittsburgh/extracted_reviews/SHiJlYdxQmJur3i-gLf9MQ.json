Diverse menu with salads, wraps, burgers, tons of appetizers, and vegetarian friendly items.  CONS: This place can get extremely packed for a Pens pre-game session leaving you to feel absolutely ignored by the bar staff who are overwhelmed with the volume of patrons. Service during non-game times is also a bit inconsistent.",

We got our drinks with no glasses. We asked for glasses and we got the after our drinks were done. My vodka tonic had no vodka, and we has asked for a slice of orange with her blue moon. We never got it after asking twice. Also we never got any plates so I had to put the wings into the same bowl they came out in. Also asked for more napkins they came when the dinner came out. Dinner was ok the steak sandwich was hot, but nothing spectacular. We ordered a second round of drinks and they came out when we were ready to leave. I was surprised how bad it was because I have been there before for penguin games last year. I will not be back .",

It was pretty empty when we went during the week at lunch time, which made it a nice setting for a business meeting. Our server was very attentive, which was great especially considering we were there for close to 2 hours.  I was eyeing the mac and cheese (and had also heard about how good it was) but opted to be a bit healthier and tried their southwest veggie wrap. I had low expectations (often times veggie wraps at restaurants are pretty lackluster) but this once was great! I loved the southwestern twist. It was plenty filling and I would definitely order it again.  If I go back, I'd love to try the mac and cheese. It was nice that they had multiple vegetarian options - often times restaurants marketed as \"grilles\" don't have much for me to choose from. It's also a great location, close to Duquesne and PPG Arena.",

My boyfriend didn't enjoy his burger a whole lot. The meat was fairly dry and the condiments and spices didn't add a whole lot of flavor. However, those were the only complaints we could walk away with. The chips and dipping sauce were a great side & my burger was amazing! Everything went together very well and the sauce made the burger not as dry (we both asked for medium well but received more of a well done patty) But I cant leave out the amazing wings!! We went on wing night and will most likely be returning for many many more. They weren't like home but still amazing. The wings were big and there was plenty of meat and the outside was crunchy and flavorful. I got the honey siracha and he got the peach habanero. Both were fairly spicy but just 6 wings each were plenty to fill us both! We're excited to try all the different flavors in the future. All this being said, in summary, the burgers were ok but nothing to write home about. The wings however will be what calls us back! Great place to escape from campus for an hour.",

I usually get the Turkey burger with the onion/cucumber slaw. The slaw on this burger is TO DIE FOR. When I know I'm going to be going there for a meeting, I dream about the turkey burger in advance. They also have a good selection of homemade mac and cheese.   Happy Hour is pretty good with some discount cocktails and drafts and a reduced price menu.

The burger was fine. Could have used a little more flavor, but not terribly bland. I really liked the coleslaw, which was vinegar based. They gave you a hardy helping too!  I like that they have some local brews on tap, but I believe there were only about six draft choices. Am I spoiled by the craft brew bars that have like 40 beers on tap? Probably.  Not a bad pre-game option. But like I said, they might have to step it up a bit if more restaurants start popping up around here.",

It's by far the closest bar and restaurant from campus, within a five- or 10-minute walk from most buildings. It's also a prime location for Consol Energy Center folk, only steps away.  I understand where the term red ring comes from, since Duquesne has a distinctive class ring with a red jewel. However, the name instantly makes me think of a ringworm symptom. Kinda icky from the get go, especially considering it's a restaurant and all.  The food here is incredibly average, but what was a really big turn off for me is they were essentially serving dressed up campus food. At least before Aramark lost their contract, students looking to get a break from what they have in their meal plan would likely be disappointed because the food was from the same supplier. The same thing might apply now, but can't be sure because I haven't eaten campus food since then.  Also, the hours there can be really unusual and inconsistent, especially during the summer months.  Biggest perk? They serve beer. But even that's kinda overpriced. College kids and Consol Energy Center visitors alike would probably have a better time at Milano's. Or anywhere else.",

We had Duquesne on draft.  5.00 for a 23 ounce draft during happy hour seemed a little much.  We each had a sandwich.  I had the pulled pork which had a nice taste, and my wife had an Italian sandwich which she enjoyed.  Sandwiches were priced fairly (around 9.00 each),  Overall there are quite a few bars around Consol with more bars to come.  Red Ring doesn't set itself apart to make it stand out in the crowd.  I would definitely look elsewhere during my visits to Consol for a drink and meal.",

    "text": "Right on Duquesne's campus and a perfect place to go before a concert or Pens game at the Consol Energy Center.  It can get crowded before games/concerts so make sure to leave plenty of time. The bar is also fun to hang out at as they have great game day drink specials.  I ordered the 2nd Shift pale ale for the $3 special-the bartenders said it tasted just like Yuengling which it did.  For dinner I went with the cobb wrap which was a cobb salad (egg, cheese, chicken, tomatoes, lettuce, bacon) in a wrap. The hot bacon dressing was delicious. My date ordered the turkey club with homemade chips which he too enjoyed. My only complaint is that I ordered mashed potatoes as my side instead of fries and they charged me $1.99 extra.",

    "text": "This unfortunately named restaurant conjures up two images for me.  The first is the death of a fairly expensive gaming system, and the second is too childish for me to admit to, but when this place is suggested for lunch, I flash back to the time I did the triple atomic wings challenge at Quaker Steak.  For that I apologize sincerely, but I can't control my brain, yo.  The point of that thought train is that subconsciously, I think this place already had a few marks going against it.  My friend and I have been for lunch a few times since it's so close to his office, and really the biggest surprise is that nothing is good, but nothing is really bad either...it's as bland as a dry wedding.  The worst offense being the \"signature\" chicken fingers, which tasted like neither chicken, nor fingers.  It reminded me of that flavorless feast from \"A Wrinkle in Time\".  L'Engled!  The wrap I had was alright, but this restaurant sets the bar pretty low.  I'm assuming this is a chain since it looks like an amalgam of every chain restaurant I have ever been to.  Little bit o' Fridays, mixed with a dose of Applebees, with just a hint of Damons thrown in.  It's menu and appearance are just super dull, and really, with a thousand cool restaurants so close, this seems like a terrible misstep.  My suggestion to the Red Ring marketing department: just embrace the fact that you've named your restaurant after an inflamed butthole and make your menu all about incredibly hot food challenges.  You've just been given a Christmas miracle, my friends.",

    "text": "I was quite happy when this restaurant first opened because there was finally an option for grabbing dinner before a Pen's game that wasn't the Souper Bowl (dirty, crowded, nasty food) or the Steelhead Grille (very,very expensive).  The decor is nice and upscale, and the food was consistently good, but the servers were hit-or-miss.   And the place was always packed before the games so we had to arrive early to get seated and enjoy our dinner.  Because of the NHL strike and other factors, we hadn't been to a game in 10 months.  Something very bad happened at Red Ring in those months. The meal portions have decreased and the entrees we ordered just weren't as good as they used to be.  And, really, the meals are served in red plastic baskets with a lovely checked piece of paper underneath?  Are we at the beach ordering fried seafood?  Their presentation used to be quite good, now it's... plastic baskets.  And our server was one of the worst we have had in our 3(?) years of eating meals there.  We noticed as we were leaving that there are no longer lines of people to be seated, and it made sense.  Many of their former customers are going elsewhere-- but WHERE?   We will probably not be back unless our only option is the Souper Bowl...",

We arrived inside and stood at the hostess stand. No one was there to greet us and that was fine, there never is. Usually, a waiter or waitress multitasks and comes over to greet and seat us right away. However, today we stood there for a good 5 minutes and waited for an employee to come over.   Finally, a waiter comes up and seats this group of 2 people that arrived right before us. He then proceeded to tend to other tables by getting their orders or refilling beverages, etc. Then, another waitress appears and she makes eye contact with us and sees we have been waiting. Clearly, we are annoyed, however she decides to clean some tables even though there are about 15 other clean tables available for us to sit at.   Both the waiter and waitress continued to look up at us, as we aimlessly stood at the hostess stand, but still no one came over! Finally, after about 10 minutes, we all actually started to laugh at how ridiculous the situation was and left.   Seriously! Either hire a hostess, get more employees, or tell the staff that they should want to seat guests for lunch. Unfortunately, every time I think of that place, I'm going to think of that terrible experience.",

We get there and are told that happy hour does not apply to PPG event days, which was not listed online or even on the menu or the happy hour menu.

    "text": "Another great option for lunch down near the Arena just down from Duquesne. I wasn't sure what to expect walking in but this place was setup pretty nice and looks to be a bit higher class than I thought it would be being this close to campus. They had a lot of good lunch options including burgers, sandwiches and salads. Most come with an option of fries or homemade chips which I highly recommend. The chips come with a great French onion dip.  We ordered the Nachos and Soft Pretzels as appetizers and these both came out quickly. Both were excellent! The Pretzels were well made and super soft with a good cheese sauce while the Nachos came with chicken, baked on cheese along with fresh veggies including fresh chunks of avocado and raw jalapeno.  There was plenty to share and a table of five didn't finish them all.  For my entree I went with the Cheesesteak which didn't disappoint!  The horseradish/A1 combo was simply fantastic!  It was a large portion and had to be cut in half to easily eat. I already mentioned the chips/dip but it's worth saying again so make sure to try them.  The service was fine. Nothing over the top. She seemed friendly enough but didn't really go out of her way even though we were one of two tables at the time.  We did all have a laugh and point out that I was the only one not to receive a refill. I'm also the only one who got water. If you are paying for your drink, I guess it's a one time only deal haha!    I'd like to come make and check out their dinner and night life. There bar looked pretty stocked and they had a decent amount of TVs for games and such. Curious if they do any music nights or anything.  Definitely check it out when in the area.",

Although it was packed, I think we got there late enough where some people were leaving for the show because we got seated right away. They were selling Metallica's \"Enter Night\" pilsner, which was cool, but they sold out really quickly.   We ordered some nachos, buffalo chicken dip and a couple of drinks. Everything came out really quick, but also tasted that way. The food was \"meh\", really nothing special. Not much flavor. My friend got one of the drink specials with Tuaca and she said it was super sweet. I just got a simple Jameson and water, so mine was as expected.  Our waitress was really nice (even with the busy atmosphere) and took our order really quick, but when it came time for the check, we sat around for a while scanning the room looking for her.  Overall, everything was pretty average. I wouldn't tell you not to go there, but just keep it simple and don't go expecting an awesome meal.",

    "text": "I can't believe I'd never reviewed the Red Ring. I used to LOVE this restaurant. It's close to the arena, the service is always very friendly, the food is decent, etc.  THEN, the female manager started interacting with us and I just haven't liked the place since. The service is still friendly and food is still okay, but the rude manager really makes an impact - especially since she encourages bad seating processes.  Once, we were going to have a party of 3 and were seated at a table for 6, though the restaurant was mostly empty and there were PLENTY of tables that seated 4 (our friend had to cancel, so we moved to a table of 4 knowing there would be only 2 of us and the table was used for a party of 5 later).  MANY times, we've been there with parties of 4 when they wouldn't seat us at a table for 6, since they think there may be a bigger party coming in later - they'd have tons of people waiting for tables and lots of available tables, but be unwilling to sit parties together (as they do in some busy bars that have poor table layouts) or sit a smaller party at a larger table. They do the same thing when there are 2 people and a bunch of tables that seat 4. We've been seated and gotten through our whole meal while couples waited to be seated, though there were empty tables. Kinda crazy that they would rather LOSE MONEY than seat people.  I've seen other reviews mentioning this female manager, which doesn't surprise me, since she has been rude 100% of the time we've dealt with her and we used to go to the Red Ring a lot more. We've gotten more and more annoyed with the management and tend to choose other restaurants so we don't have to deal with her.  The mac & cheese is cold 99.99% of the time when you first get it (one time it was warm - I almost passed out from shock). I'm not sure how they prepare it, but whatever they do, it'll sometimes have steam coming off, but it's always cold. Knowing this, I touch a noodle with a finger as soon as I get it and send it back to be warmed up. Usually, this is not an issue. The waiter/waitress or male manager takes it back to be heated, apologizes, etc. A couple times, our food has been delivered by the female manager. On those occasions, she has actually argued with me (though she SAW me touch the noodles with my finger to see if it was warm or not). Even if I had no feeling in that finger and I happened to be incorrect (not the case), I see no reason for a manager to argue with me over my food. We keep hoping he'll move on to another restaurant and give the Red Ring a try again occasionally. I read a review that said they're managed by Aramark, which surprised me, since Aramark tends to be a smart company and it doesn't seem like they'd want a manager who's always rude and chooses empty tables over tables with people at them so often.   I've tried to find out how to contact the district manager (or even store manager if it's not the rude female manager), but I've had no luck. I've asked to speak with the male manager about the issues with the rude manager a couple times, but he's normally been too busy helping out, since we only go there before Penguins games. (I've had a good interaction with him over other issues earlier in our history with the Red Ring and think talking to him might be useful.)  If you decide to go there, get there well before any event, so you can be seated without issues. If you have any issues, try to get the male manager, since the only female manager we've seen there will NOT care at all and will probably just upset you more.   The food is still decent and all the wait staff we've ever dealt with has been very friendly. If you don't have to deal with the female manager at all, I think the Red Ring is decent (I'd rate it a 4). If you do, I'd rate it a 1 at best. Good luck!",

With all of the on-campus options shut down for the holidays, this place was convenient as it was across Forbes Ave. from the University grounds.  There were four in our party. We walked in at half past noon and had no trouble getting seated right away. Our server attended to us quickly and did a commendable job taking care of us. It was a typical pub setting. We were talking business over lunch and, while this place was not exactly quiet, it was not over the top as the atmosphere was more than adequate in allowing us to carry on discussions.  They offered several lunch-size meals for reasonable prices. I opted for the smoked pork tacos with homemade kettle chips. I was quite happy with the taste and the portion of this unusual choice.  I will likely give this place a try on a future visit to Duquesne. It is a convenient off-campus option offering decent quality fare.",

However, when there isn't a home game the place seems pretty lifeless. It can be the perfect choice when you don't feel like waiting for a table anywhere else around town.  The menu is simple and traditional and it is certainly a great option when you don't want to  spend money on high priced food and drinks at Consol.

They have 4 different kinds of Mac and cheese, mine however came out luke warm when we went for lunch time. They were not too busy but busy enough it seems. Nice little set up right across the street from Duquesne University. Will have to try again",

    "text": "Stopped by after parking for a penguin game. Was surprisingly not very crowded and we were able to be seated within a couple minutes. The menu contains typical bar and grille food including pretzel, spinach artichoke dip, loaded nachos... also had salads, sandwiches and burgers. They appeared adequately staffed for the number of tables but the service was pretty slow. I ordered chicken tenders and fries. I thought the tenders would come in the wing sauce I chose but the sauce was on the side. The \"tenders\" had a very thin breading that was bone dry. I'm not convinced they weren't sliced breasts with breading. The fries were ok. We ordered a farmer burger which was well cooked and very good. Overall, the visit satisfied our need for quick food without being too expensive. May consider going back before a game if the crowd is low but would not wait long before considering somewhere else.",

We also understand it's a game night, but for those of us who like to drink craft beer, we don't like to drink it out of a plastic cup. It really does affect the flavor. Most of the restaurants we have been to around the arena serve their craft beer in glasses.",

They're honey Cajun wings are to die for. I can't Speak for any of the other food because I ALWAYS order wings and fries. The wait sometimes is annoying but that's expected considering it's location.",

    "text": "The atmosphere here is nice. We came on a weekday for lunch so it wasn't crazy busy, but I've heard it can get pretty intense before a Pens game and on the weekends.  The services was ok. Seems like they needed more staff for the lunch rush as one waiter was pretty much taking care of every table there.   Half of their menu is different combos of mac and cheese which I'm not a huge fan of, but they have plenty of other options as well. I went with the fish sandwich special and was pretty disappointed. The fish was so thin and skinny, it was essentially 95% breading. However, the french fries that it came with were fresh cut and delicious.  What I don't really understand with this place is the fact that they have both fresh cut french fries and home made potato chips with home made french onion dip BUT they only offer them as sides. If you have both of these things, which isn't typical of every bar, why not utilize them and create some unique appetizer options? Loaded fresh cut fries, nachos supreme but with home made chips instead of tortilla chips. Instead some of their options include soft pretzels and crunchy pot stickers which both clearly come frozen.   I'm not saying I wouldn't give this place another shot, but there is definitely plenty of room to grow.",
