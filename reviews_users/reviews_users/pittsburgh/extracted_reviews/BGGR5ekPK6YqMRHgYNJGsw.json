I haven't been to MexiCasa since 2005, and I was hoping to take my husband there this weekend, but I am not so sure now.. lol   The last time I was there, the portions were huge, the guacamole homemade right in front of us (we sat at the bar area)  Seems a lot has changed since 2005.  :(   If any of you \"Authentic\" Mexican food lovers want a meal that is worth raving about, please, please visit El Campesino in Monroeville!!  Their food is awesome... authentic, and the prices are so good, you feel like you are stealing from them, seriously!  I can't speak for any of the other El Camps in the area, but the one in Monroeville is a complete staple for me and my  honey, we had our first date there, got engaged there, and continue to go there for a wonderful meal every chance we get!  :)  Plan on visiting them soon!!",

Ordered steak fajitas ... asked for my steak more rare... wish the server told me it was mystery meat - like steak-ums. Awful. Asked for shrimp instead - and got a bunch of bland bay shrimp. Really??  Food served in plastic baskets and nothing was really appetizing. I hardly ate anything as everything we ordered, including a burrito, seemed like it was worse than taco bell.  Never ever will go back. They're featured on Groupon alot... no wonder.  They need to get serious. Mexican food isn't expensive nor hard to prepare.  Quality ingredients and a knowledgeable staff who will properly advise their cliental will win over customers.",

    "text": "Theo, you amazing glorious bastard, you! Theo owns the place. Good little balding Greek boy turns our Mexican inspired cuisine that's as good as my mama's home-made pierogis... which I know none of you have had, but trust me they're good.  I've been going to Mexi-Casa with my wife, teacher friends, and family since near when he opened. What got me hooked wasn't the food but the fact that he and a couple of friends did ALL the work on building the interior. I got to sit on one side and shove mongo con queso shrimp burritos down my gullet while watching him toil away on building the bar from scratch. And since he finished the bar, my wife and I have found ourselves staggering out of the place on a large number of \"holy crap my students are going to turn out to be serial killers, I just know it\" Fridays.   The food is not traditional Mexican or even traditional tex-mex. But that doesn't mean it's not good. Consider for a moment the simple yet inspired chicken and rice bowl, which its verdant hues composed of a blending of fresh cilantro and parsley into a heady, otherworldly green sauce. The chili has lots of meat chunks and is pretty damned hot, warming you down to your toes. Thank God they have lots of good beer with which to wash it down. Frito pie... chili with Frito's and a piece of jalapeno corn bread... yummy. And the burritos, especially with the con queso sauce made with Rolling Rock beer. Get them mongo (double meat) and pick one of the hotter hot sauces from the hot sauce bar (like the always popular \"So hot your man junk will fall off\" sauce), and be prepared to feel like you're on the winning end of a Man v. Food episode: bloated, carb high, and happy.   You are a god among men, Theo.",

I mentioned that to the waitress, and she did not offer to change but said sorry about that.   I ordered tuna fish taco. they gave three of them but fist felt very dry and rubbery. My son ordered a rack of ribs, they were also not very good. I would not go there next time. The only good thing was the beer! Nothing special though.",

    "text": "I tried. I really, really tried.  Did this place go under new management or something? The last time I went here was about 3-4 years ago and I remember it being pretty good. That was definitely not the case when I made not one, but two, trips in the past 4 weeks.  My first trip was in early March. I had a craving for some Mexican and realized I hadn't been to Mexi-Casa in years and ventured up. The service was a little slow (but the server was very nice, so it made up for it), but the food. Oh my. I ordered a steak quesadilla and it was awful. I typically do not complain about food unless there is really a reason to do so and in this case, something has to be said. The reviews above that mention the poor quality of the steak are 100% accurate. My quesadilla was nothing but flavor-less, fatty, old steak-um \"meat\" smothered in an over abundance of cheese and a soggy tortilla. The second I picked it up, cheese was over flowing out and the tortilla was falling apart.   I couldn't believe how terrible it was so I went back again yesterday (4/30/14) in hopes my awful trip in March was a fluke. Unfortunately, it was not a fluke. This time, I sat in the bar area with my friend where the food is cooked. My experience this time was even worse and just put the nail in the coffin in regards to me never coming back again. SLOW and RUDE service kicked off the entire experience. The waitress behind the bar (short-ish brown hair, petite) was rude and forgetful from the start. Our food took forever to arrive (as we watched the cook make plates for people who ordered after us), our drinks even longer and zero server etiquette. When we needed something, we always had to flag her down. She never once asked if the food was okay or if we needed anything. No thank you. Nothing. I don't ask much and I understand that people have a bad day or two. But you cannot even check in to see if I am enjoying my food or need a napkin? And I was not the only patron who felt this way. Same deal with the food as last time as well. Soggy tortilla, ridiculous amount of cheese and zero flavor.  Also, a little note to the cook: don't use the same tongs you use to flip chicken and rips to touch a vegetarian's food. Basic culinary rule, there...  I've just given them more than enough chances to be a half-decent place and they just aren't. Maybe I will stop by for a Margarita some time, but never again for the food. I don't think this place is going to last much longer if they continue to not correct their issues. It's a shame because this place used to be great. Anyone know what may have happened?",

    "text": "I recently bought a house in Dormont and I was so excited to see that Mexi Casa had reopened. I've never been more disappointed in my food somewhere. I am really not picky and I wasn't expecting the best Mexican out of a Pittsburgh bar. But Mexi Casa used to be half decent and I enjoyed going there on dates or with friends. I have eaten there twice since they reopened just to make sure it wasn't a fluke or a bad day for the cook. Everything my fiance and I got was completely tasteless, no spice, and overpriced. The chicken and vegetables in the burritos appeared to be from frozen veggies or cans. The rice was dry. There was no sauce or seasoning. The wings didn't even have sauce or spices. The tacos were flavorless beef with a couple pieces of iceberg lettuce. Most appalling was that the guacamole was TEN dollars, and it was basically just smashed avocado with nothing else in it. I have never paid that much for guacamole, even for the best or large quantities of fresh made guacamole on the Tex-Mex border. It was honestly baffling. Most Pittsburgh bars have cheap food. And the nicer restaurants have good overpriced food. This was horrible food horribly overpriced. Someone needs to consult with them. Hire a chef, I don't know who's cooking now but I made better food as a teenager after school... And price your food according to your demographic. You are not an upscale restaurant in San Francisco. Your guacamole should be 5 dollars. The drinks are also overpriced and not strong at all. This is the harshest review I've ever written, but I do it because I want so badly for it to be good. It's so sad it's so close to me and inedible! They are currently repainting the building, but I wish they would put that money into making real food.",

The guac and salsa were good, but I would eat the queso with a spoon if it were socially acceptable. They have a good draft beer selection but I've never been able to resist the margaritas. We were there for $3 Cuervo margaritas and they didn't skimp on the tequila--two was enough for me. I love that they offer tofu (or vegetables) so I can eat vegetarian without having to do any special requests or modifications. Also I can always find close street parking, which is a plus of Dormont over some of the more crowded city neighborhoods. I usually go on weeknights and have no trouble getting a table for two or a couple of seats at the bar. The bar area is lively but not out of control, and the bartenders were friendly and attentive. Overall a very welcoming, fun place to hang out and get some good food and a few drinks.",

    "text": "So, I feel the need to preface this by saying I am originally from southern California. I've been to a ton of \"authentic\" Mexican restaurants. I'm talking full on Mariachi band, goat burritos, and hand written menus. Mexi-Casa has got to be the \"Whitest\" Mexican restaurant I've ever been to.  Typically Mexican joints that aren't run by people of Mexican Heritage are surfer food, big fat burritos stuffed with everything but the kitchen sink. Unfortunately Mexi-casa does not fall into either categories.  I decided to get a burrito, I figure a Mexican restaurant that can't get this staple of Mexican cuisine right is NOT a Mexican restaurant at all. It's hard to describe the flavor of this \"burrito\" as it's honestly like nothing I have ever tasted before. If I had to describe it to someone, I would say they took a stir-fry, shoved it in a tortilla, poured on some hot sauce and called it a burrito. It's really the strangest combination of flavors I've ever digested at a Mexican place.  So, between the soggy overpriced food, slow service, no corn tortillas, and room temperature beer, I don't think I'll be coming here again.  Note to the Chef: At the very least, melt the freakin' cheese on the burrito before you send it out, mine was still cold from the fridge.",

You have the option of grabbing a seat at the regular bar, or posting up at the dining room bar, where you can literally watch your food be prepared in front of you.  My dream of a burrito at this unethical cantina is the Theo Burrito: grilled steak, con queso sauce (melted, spicy cheese),  and grilled onions and peppers all wrapped up in a tortilla. It's pure bliss.  ***Make sure you ask for the Cholula, which is a MUST if you like hot sauce.  Definitely go on Wednesdays when they have $2 import bottles, including my go-to Mexican beers : Negra modelo, Sol, Corona, and Pacifico.   Warning: this place is NOT a Bar. They close around 10:30 pm and won't be afraid to make you and your buddies feel extremely awkward by being the only people there. So do avoid going to Mexi Casa if your thinking about staying out late, because they practically throw you out of the place when they feel it's time to close.",

They also have awesome daily specials on drinks and it is just an all-around chill place to hang out with friends. I love this place!",

    "text": "I went to Mexi-Casa last week. Let me tell you how excited I was to go to my local Mexican restaurant in good ole Dormont. I had come when they first opened and wasn't happy with the service and couldn't eat much because I am allergic to flour and there were no corn tortillas. I figured time had passed and it takes time for restaurants to get into a rhythm. I optimistically thought they must have just been out of the tortillas.  Wrong. I was shocked by how little had changed as well as a number of other things. One, THERE ARE NO CORN TORTILLAS IN A MEXICAN FREAKING RESTAURANT. This bothers me on a number of levels. One, IT IS A MEXICAN RESTAURANT. It makes me wonder if the owner has ever been to Mexico or even to a taco truck in Miami. Two, I am allergic to flour. I love Mexican restaurants because it is USUALLY so easy for me to order. Three, I like corn tortillas. You don't have to be authentic to just have the tortillas frozen somewhere for that person who like Mexican food to be a little more like Mexican food. I am cool with Tex/Pit- Mex, but seriously, this is ridiculous.   So, we got the nachos. Which was a bunch of American cheese literally dumped on the nachos, black olives from a can, and some pretty good shredded chicken. There wasn't any salsa, jalapenos, sour cream, nothing. Then, the kicker is that she charged us a dollar for the ridiculously small helping of salsa we requested. This crappy nacho order cost ten dollars. WOW.  Oh, did I mention that we were given STYROFOAM PLATES. I mean, do they even make that shit anymore????  I love Dormont. I am trying really hard to support its businesses, but Mexi-Casa is making it really hard.",

The shrimp tacos were okay, but the taco shells were stale.  They came with a cup of black bean and corn salad which I just ended up mixing with the slaw and shrimp and ate it like a salad.  My husbands burrito was okay.  It gets soggy so be careful cutting into it as you'll end up eating the paper at the bottom of the plastic basket they serve it in.  The drinks.....for $8 where was the alcohol?  Seriously they should be ashamed to serve $8 drinks with no alcohol in them.  I mean, I don't need a flammable level of booze, but the booze in a mixed drink is part of the flavor.  My Mule tasted weird, like a sweet flat something on ice.  It took me a awhile to figure out it tasted like flat ginger ale. A mule contains ginger beer, not ginger ale!  It definitely makes a difference.  On a positive, the servers and staff were nice, and they play a good mix of music from the bar on the other side.  The chicken soup and jalapeno cornbread were excellent!   Unfortunately, this meal was $46 before tip.   We won't head back as I'm not cool with paying tourist level prices for food this mediocre.",

Prices are inflated and do not reflect the small, lacking in ingredients options, that are all served with plastic utensils and in plastic baskets. After 10 the place pretty much turns into a bar, with a very limited food selection and the dining area closed off. And it doesn't morph into a very good one either; it becomes a small, crowded room lacking music or anything resembling entertainment, for that matter. I gave it 2 stars because my hip server was efficient and friendly, and because their Margarita selection is unique and enticing.",

    "text": "A return stop to Mexi-Casa was beyond overdue, especially considering the bundle of poor reviews that were written since my last visit, so here I came for a to-go meal.   In all fairness, I am tempted to knock off a single star for the underseasoned ground beef that filled the tacos (Dear old Dad felt the same way), but with such a refreshing, effulgently red, cilantro-blessed salsa at hand, who really needs salt, pepper, or spices? Loaded with a blend of shredded cheeses and wrapped in velvety tortillas that could lovingly blanket infants, Mexi-Casa's tacos are as satiating as they are gratifying.   The Acapulco Burrito is obscenely humongous and therefore requires no appetizers or sides. This burrito is rough trade, hefty as a rhino, and is almost overglutted with pulled pork, rice, lettuce, cheese, and even two cuts of grilled pineapple. The gob of pulled pork was juicy, full-bodied, and was complimented by the caramelized rings of yellow citrus. The fellow manning the grill seemingly labored to fold the burrito into a neat parcel, smiling at me as he packed that soft tortilla to its limits, silently assuring me that I was in for a generous culinary treat.   It was so massive, it eventually burst! Rice and pork were scattered about the styrofoam container, but at this point, the burrito was close to a memory, and I finished the remnants eagerly with a fork.   Mom's Steak Quesadilla was another smooth, meaty, cheesy triumph. Strands of dairy product formed as I pulled each triangle away from my teeth, salsa and sour cream topping each pleasureable cut.   I genuinely (and we all know that genuineness is out of vogue in the Yelpiverse) enjoyed Mexi-Casa's food this clammy evening as much as I did the first time around, and the place was doing brisk, brisk business. What they offer is as good as any of the better Mexican restaurants in the city that I have been to, and that includes places that are unmistakably owned/operated by people of Latin descent.   Now to address some of the dumber, meaner, cheaper, more misrepresentative reviews.  I did not find the place to be \"dirty\" or \"cramped\" at all, and the decor was as offbeat, colorful, and tasteful as I recalled it to be.    They close at midnight, not 10:30.   It is a bar AND restaurant. A business can be both at once.   I don't see how Taco Bell is better than Mexi-Casa. Then again, I don't hold a grudge against the current owners and did not know the original proprietors personally.   Mexi-Casa itself states on their website that they do not make authentic Mexican food, whatever that entails. Move to Mexico if you cannot deal with that.    Not every Mexican restaurant can or has to serve corn tortillas. I do not know how that rule originated.   None of the diners I saw were eating from styrofoam plates.   *sigh*",

My friend has spicy chicken tacos and I had beef tacos. It's about the equivalent of something you could make at home. We also got the three dip special. Guacamole and salsa were great, but avoid the queso. It's the same bright yellow cheese dip that comes from a large can. Mexi-Casa is convenient for drinks; I could take or leave the food.",

For the burrito it was $9 probably $10 with tax, and I have to say I like the steak burrito from Chipotle better.

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place.  We were driving through Dormont, saw all of the neon lights and turned around to check it out.  There was a \"Victory\" sign, which is a sign of excellent Pennsylvania beer, and after living in Southern California for eight years, I became quite the Mexican food junkie.  About a mile up the road is the place where I got my first sampling of Mexican Food in the 70s, Jose and Tony's, which has lost its luster under the new ownership, so Mexi-Casa sounded like our new hope in my old stomping ground.  Well, they did have good beer on tap - ONE good beer.  Victory Hop Devil is an old favorite, and I buy it often.  There was something not quite right about the 22-ounce Hop Devil that I was served. (Besides the whopping $7.25 purchase price...)  It didn't taste right, and I know what it's supposed to taste like.  The menu got my hopes up.  It was quite extensive, and I quickly decided on the \"Soon-To-Be-Famous\" steak burrito, because nobody can resist advertising like that.  My partner got a trio of tacos - grilled chicken, taco meat, and steak.  While we were waiting for our food to be prepared, we munched a basket of tortilla chips and salsa, which I immediately identified as being produced by Reyna Foods in the Strip District.  Yay!  Reyna makes the best chips and salsa in the city.  SCORE!  We loved the chips and salsa and didn't mind paying $5.50.  My partner's margarita was pretty good, but the bartender looked at us with a blank stare on her face when I asked if she could get us a BLUE margarita, my favorite drink up the street at Jose and Tony's.  Nope.  When the food arrived, I admired the presentation, but was quickly disappointed, because despite the fact that my burrito was quite a handful, it was absolutely the most bland tasting burrito I had ever had.  All I could taste was virtually unseasoned rice and a very large amount of refried beans.  The steak inside had zero flavor, and I had to pile on large amounts of the Reyna salsa to get any flavor at all.  Unseasoned meat piled up with rice and beans in a large flour tortilla does NOT a burrito make...  My partner's tacos were three different meats, but were virtually indistinguishable.  The ingredients had virtually no seasoning whatsoever.  In fact, we shared quite a snicker when we looked inside the \"steak\" taco, which was highlighted by little strips of sliced up \"Steak-Ums,\" totally unseasoned, overcooked, cardboard pieces of \"meat.\"  Well, the people working there were very nice, and they had a pretty good crowd when we walked in.  I decided that I will give this place another chance and try something else on the menu next time, but it is my sincere hope that in the meantime, someone will bring the blandness factor to the owner's attention.  Even if my bill had been half of what it was, I would have walked out thoroughly dissatisfied, because the place is actually pretty nice, and the servers are very nice, and it's in one of my favorite parts of town.  It really deserves one-and-a-half stars for tonight, anyway...  I would have given this dining experience a SINGLE star had it not been for the fact that the people working there were so friendly.",

For $16 you get 4 tortillas, boiled beef, lettuce, flavorless cheese, peppers, onions, 1/2 lb. sour cream and NO SALSA OF ANY KIND, NO RICE, NO BEANS. If you want salsa, you have to order it as a side! My husband, who's not a picky eater, could not finish them. The burritos are bland as well. When you order black beans you get exactly that... black beans straight from a can. I can't even believe they dare to serve that and call it a side. The only thing that is decent is the Southwest Platter, but that doesn't make up for the rest. Terrible, overpriced \"Mexican\" food. If you're in the area, go to Mad Mex instead. Heck, even Chipotle is better than this place.",

Penny, the other server I had before, is very similar.   Aside from outstanding service, the hard shell tacos were so crunchy-good, stuffed to the hilt with fresh lettuce, ground beef, shredded cheese and tomatoes, that I was happy to overlook the iceberg they use (I mean, seriously, who's going to trot out the Arugula for a taco?).  On Tuesdays, hard shell tacos are $1/ea. The softshells are$1.50/ea. Granted, I was hungry, but ate 3 hard shells (1 more than usual), leaving absolutely no room for fried icecream (3 flavors), or the Caramel Apple Cheesecake. So bummed, but the really, really good Margarita took the edge off my disappointment.  The fact that for outstanding service, 3 big tacos and a Margarita, my bill was only $10.70  was the cherry on top. (oh, gosh, too stuffed to mention food...)",

Their prices are higher than you'd expect for Mexican food especially at lunch time. We ordered the fajita quesadilla with steak and meat chili that doesn't contain beans (? but they added them for us) and spicy cornbread. The cornbread was perfect - moist with a little heat. The chili was lukewarm, and I like my chili hot. I did not ask for them to heat it up in their microwave bc we never use microwaves and certainly don't expect use of microwave when dining out. The quesadilla came with small chips and salsa, otherwise you have to order chips and salsa for around $6 which is steep, since most Mexican restaurants complimentary chips and salsa is a given staple! Also no rice included. Despite the friendly staff, I would not come back here.",

    "text": "This place...good grief. I have lived in Dormont for 5 years. So I had eaten at Mexi Casa when it was under original ownership. It really wasn't bad for American style Mexican food. The food was a little inconsistent but I was never expecting top notch Tex Mex. When I had heard it reopened I was excited to see what improvements were made. Unfortunately, somehow this mediocre place became awful. My roommate and I were a little late but we're really craving a Bloody Mary. What we got was no more than tomato juice with pepper in it. I didn't taste any vodka at all. For $8, I would at least expect some celery salt or horseradish. If the bartender didn't have the ingredients to make the drinks we would have been happier picking something else.  Our food made the drinks seem impressive. I ordered the \"wanna iguana\" burrito. The description says that it has spicy chicken, queso, rice and beans. I opted out of the beans just because sometimes I feel that they tend to take over the burrito. The burrito was disgusting. The queso was too thin and just saturated everything. The chicken was also texturally similar to that from a can. There was not an ounce of spice to it either. The oddest part about the burrito is that the rice had corn and peas in it. PEAS. Weird. I have been to actual Mexican restaurants where they use several vegetables that one would not expect. My great grandmother put potatoes in her beef enchiladas. But this is not a place where creative cooking is expected so it just seemed more like the rice was a mix with dehydrated corn and peas in it. Overall I am saddened by this place.",

    "text": "I've lived in Dormont for 3 years and have never hit this place up. Why? Well, there's absolutely no good reason! I love Mexican food too, so this means there's been a lot of missed opportunities to eat tacos.   While I feel like there's always a great debate about what's \"authentic\" Mexican food, I always feel like I can't chime in. I know that there are taco's I like, and taco's I don't like. A lot of it for me has to do with flavor. So my knowledge isn't on what's \"authentic\" but what is tasty to me.   I had the taco platter where you're able to choose from a plethora of different meats. Sadly, this did not include the \"new\" fish tacos, which I was bummed about. I went with the spicy chicken, pulled pork and portobello mushroom. They come dressed with lettuce, cheese and onion, in a flour tortilla (you can also get a hardshell).   While the mushroom was a little blah, the spicy chicken and pulled pork were awesome. What made them awesome was the meats, of course. They were seasoned fantastically and cooked perfectly. I kept saying over and over how good they were.   I also had a side of guacamole and salsa. The salsa is more of a pico de gallo, but I dig that kind. I also thought the gauc was very good. Plus, they have a whole wall FULL of hot sauces you can choose from. I'm literally in sauce heaven here!  Their beer list is small, but they have some good drafts, like the Pumpking. I mean, there's nothing like a taco and Pumpking... I kid, I kid. I also kept going back to the drink menu and looking at this Apple Pie cocktail made with moonshine. You're only allowed to order 2 per person, assumably so you don't run down the street naked or something. I threw caution to the wind and ordered one. It was delicious and not once did I taste any kind of alcohol. You definitely could end up in the danger zone. Glad I stuck to one.   The service was incredibly friendly and I'm excited to make this my new go to Mexican joint in Dormont!",

    "text": "The good:   I had a spicy chicken burrito and added sour cream and guac.  The burrito was delicious, the price wasn't bad, and the place seemed clean.  The bad:    I asked for chips and salsa without checking the price.  (My mistake)  Prior to their arrival I looked and it was almost $6.  I was a little bummed at that point, but it got worse.  The chips were not the restaurant quality type that you would expect, especially since they were not complimentary with the meal.  So they were extra salty, a little thick, and more crunchy than crispy.  They were definitely room temperature.  The salsa was truly shameful to anyone who's had real salsa, or at least salsa made by someone who cared a little.  Most salsas sold in jars have way more flavor.  This pairing should definitely have been free.  I'd be embarrassed to charge for it.  Rant over.",

    "text": "The food here is pretty decent. Definitely great for a local bite without breaking the bank. We particularly enjoy their taco Tuesdays and Wing Wednesdays. The best thing about mexi-casa has to be the server by the name of Ashley. We've had her serve us a number of times now and she is always fantastic! She has such an upbeat personality, has yet to mess up an order, and is very attentive and thoughtful. My husband and I agree she is the best server we've had in years, anywhere. If you want good food and great service I recommend this spot.",
