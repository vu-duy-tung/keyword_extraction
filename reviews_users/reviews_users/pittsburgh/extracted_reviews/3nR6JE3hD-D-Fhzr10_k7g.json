It's nothing like Red Lobster though--way nicer/fancier interior, and staff who are all knowledgeable about the menu and actually care about their customers. Even when my mum and I popped in one late night before they were closing, they still accommodated us! Trout and salmon are both very fresh and tasty, especially with almonds or other nuts crusted on them. Lobster bisque is 5 out of 5 stars, and the desserts are to die for! Never a long wait either, I love this place and I love the interior.",

    "text": "I went here on a recent business trip, and there aren't many decent options in West Homestead, so I decided to splurge on the company's dollar and  ordered take-out.     I was highly disappointed in the service, and I only ordered take out.    Upon going to the bar to announce that I was there for take out, there were 3 other people at the bar.   The bartender had her back to me and it wasn't until a few minutes had passed that another guest told her that she should wait on me.      After announcing the reason for my visit, she checks on my order (not ready yet) and helps other tables.  No offer of water, or a drink.  Another gentleman working the bar asked the bartender if she had offered me a drink, she stated to him my order would be right up.   He then asked if she offered me a water, to which she replied, her order is going to be right up.    He placed a glass of water in front of me.  Then I hear my name and order announced by the kitchen staff.   3 staff members yelled. .  .\"it's TAKEOUT\"  so back it went into the kitchen to be packed up.  Gentelman bartender asks female bartender if she has rung me up yet (she had not)  After more time had passed (how long does it take to put food into a takeout container?)   it finally is put down in front of me.  She then rings me up.   I don't expect take out to be piping hot, but at this point i wondered if it was even going to be room.  When i go to eat my meal, utensils were not included.  I now had to go find something to eat my lukewarm food with.   VERY DISAPPOINTING experience.   Will not be returning.",

This last Friday I walked in, and I was able to be seated immediately without a reservation. It was about 6:30 when we went in, and at about 8pm when we left, it was pretty packed. The seafood has always been good and fresh, and this was the first time in my life that I had swordfish and it was moist and tasty. They have a signature way of steaming their fish (if you ask for it this way) with ginger, sesame seeds and soy sauce over spinach and rice. It is excellent. They have a full bar, with a few good drafts (Guiness and Dogfish 60). Definitely pricey among the Waterfront restaurants, but to me it is worth it.",

All good but too much sauce on scallops.  Husband had surf n turf special. Snow crab legs tasty but smaller portion than I expected. Glad they had raw oysters,  but no idea where they were from.  For $2.50 each you'd think they'd say.  Waitstaff friendly but inexperienced when it came to wine.  We taught two of them how to open a champagne bottle.  Nice time out,  but two gripes... #1 Used my phones flashlight to see if there was an outlet on the floor.  Felt like an archaeologist finding old remains of dinners gone by.  Crumbs,  napkins wedged between booth and wall,  gum,  dirt.  For the price I would expect a cleaner place. #2 our waiter kept saying Thank you. After every single sentence,  even when it wasn't appropriate.  Silly gripe,  right?  But it was way over the top and felt more like,  Can I have a tip?  Can I have a tip?",

The steamed mussels, an appetizer, was fresh and the sauce complemented their delicate flavor nicely. For entree, we got the Blacken Chilean Steelbass and the House Special Cedar Smoked Salmon.  Biting into the blackened steelbass was, well, fun, but the taste isnt' anything revolutionary and it was a bit dry.  The Salmon had potential for innovative dish, but it was overly sweet and vinegary, which gave it a generic cast.For dessert, we got the mini creme brulee, a highlight of the meal. It had a particularly rich creamy body with a thin layer of caramel. The whip cream that came with it was outstanding and not merely decorative.   For a seafood place, the price was very reasonable.",

    "text": "I am posting my review again as it was not deemed important enough to keep.  Funny within days I was contacted by customer service of Landry's asking for my contact information. I gave it twice and no one bothered to contact me.  Stay far away from this place.  Extremely high priced for below average food.  What a disappointing Easter dinner.  We had eaten here twice last year and the service was impeccable, food delicious, piping hot.  I did not realize that Ruth's Chris had sold to Landry's, the change is not a good one.  We made reservations for five and were seated promptly, drinks were brought.  A very good crab dip and salads were enjoyed by all.  Then the main courses arrived.  First let me say that something occurred because the table seated after us of the same size were served first. Finally four of our five meals were brought.  The hush puppies and fries were cold, the seafood was ok, the coleslaw was warm as if it had all sat under a warming light.  The planked salmon was good but not hot.  Five minutes later the $32 Easter special came out. One tiny lobster tail with some salty stuffing. No discernible seafood in the stuffing.  4 small very dry over cooked shrimp with a blob of salty stuffing, a large blob of cold dry hard mashed redskins.  We were all shocked.  Our waitress, who was actually wonderful felt terrible and knew something had gone wrong when she saw the other table served before us and then us short a plate.  She spoke to her manager several times and asked him to talk to us.  When he finally did he told me he was sorry and that I should have told him sooner so he could fix it???  He was very rude to us.  Offered us a free dessert. I told him he couldn't possibly think I was going to pay for inedible food. He begrudgingly took  the price of 2 of the less expensive entrees off the bill.  I had been looking forward to this holiday meal for weeks.  His poor management skills and rude behavior ruined our holiday.  I will never go back.  manager of Mitchells in Homestead, you should be ashamed of how you treated us.  Landry's needs to look into this restaurant if they expect people to keep coming.  Those prices are only acceptable for fantastic food and service.",

My fiance had the New Orleans Seafood Gumbo which I had a taste of it and it was good, but I liked my soup better...very rich and creamy but full of flavor with a fair amount of lobster bits mixed in. The bread they served with the apps was fresh baked (I believe sourdough) and it was quite tasty along with the whipped butter. Our entrees came with house salads - had great elements, but I felt I couldn't enjoy mine because the dressing given was a poppyseed vinagrette and I can't handle too much acidity in my food these days. My fiance however cleaned his salad plate (not a sentence I utter often). ENTREES: I had one of the specials, Grilled Shrimp and Scallops with roasted summer vegetables and tomato vinagrette (which I asked for on the side). The seafood part was great - the vegetables were so-so. My fiance had the special of Cod stuffed with Lobster (and some other seafood) with asparagus and a lemony sauce - I had a taste of his and it was really yummy, I'll def order that next time! We both finished our plates, which wasn't too challenging b/c the portions were moderate (I got 3  srhimp and 3 scallops for example) but still filling. DESSERT: Didn't order any SERVICE: Friendly, though a little sparse. After we finished our meals we felt like we were waiting around for awhile before we could ask for our check. But our server was overall friendly and we didn't feel neglected or anything. DEALS/DISCOUNTS: None OVERALL: We liked the variety and freshness of seafood. Def a place we'd consider going to again, which is the main mark of a very good experience!",

I was not in the mood for seafood so I had the bacon cheeseburger. You can't go wrong with a burger right? Well, let me tell you, that was one of the best burgers that I've had and I frequent restaurants who specialize in them. It had a beautiful char flavor to it. I did not need any condiments. The broccoli I had was wonderful as well and I especially enjoyed the seasoning.  The only thing that slightly sullied it for me is that it was too dark.

She was extremely friendly and polite.. and patient, and knowledgeable, and personable, and attentive.. seriously, she was wonderful.

    "text": "What a horrible experience we just had at this restaurant!! Food was cold and not the same we have been used to in past years. Apparently they have just been bought out and everyone in the restaurant has been quitting. Parking lot was completely empty. Manager did not even come over to apologize for our food being mediocre. In the end our $300 bill with a party of 8 was not even comped one bit! We never saw the manager and waitress apologized because no one working there seems to care anymore. This place will be closed soon. It's a shame because it was one of our favorites. I guess nothing lasts forever. Stay away from this place! Overpriced, food went downhill and what used to be a very busy vibrant restaurant now seems like a cold morgue!! My husband's birthday celebration was a complete disaster!!",

Fortunately they brought out the kids' meals before our entrees, but our entrees also took forever to arrive. Our empty appetizer and entree dishes sat for a long time before anyone removed them. Then after we finished eating we were left forgotten for at least 15 minutes before I got the chance to ask for the check (to save time I just handed over my card instead of checking over the tab first.) Our entire meal lasted two hours, which is very slow for lunch service. Our server did apologize for the long waits.  But it wasn't like only one part of the meal was like that, but the entire meal. The food was decent but the slow service put a damper on our experience and I have qualms about coming back.",

We all concluded that though the food was good, they were served luke warm at best. Portions we also very small. Bottom line is that it wasn't bad for an average restaurant but for what you are going to pay it is NOT worth it at all. I was so disappointed. We will never be back.

Appetizers: had the crab dip and calamari. Both were good. Servers brought extra chips with the dip as they were needed. I'm always surprised that more chips are not just added to the original dish at this point. Dip was good. Calamari was done well. Preferred the shrimp cocktail Sauce with it versus the Asian type soy sauce that is served with it.   Wedge salad with bleu cheese. Waaaaaay too much cheese and I like bleu cheese.   I had the blackened tuna with mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies. Carrots were carrot sticks hardly cooked and dry! Green beans overdone and broccoli had seen better days. Simple green beans would have been more appetizing.  Tuna had blackening spices but needed a better sear on it. Was not over cooked. Potatoes as expected.  Other dishes seen--fisherman's platter. Looked a little greasy, but that's expected from me in a full fried dish. Would be nice if this was offered broiled as well. Crab cakes and filet looked okay.   Overall I'm always underwhelmed and overcharged here. I guess with chain places you get that, but I want more from a place that charges me 25 bucks for sub-seared tuna.",

My wife and I arrived at 7 on the dot and were immediately seated.  We were there 20 seconds when our waitress rushes over and apologizes for making us wait.  20 seconds?  We ordered drinks, which came quickly, then we ordered appetizers and the main course.  My wife had calamari, which was to die for, and I had oysters on the half (great choice).  We both ordered surf and turf and the steak and the lobster was done to perfection.  A little free dessert for my birthday and a round of applause from the fellow dinners capped it off. Service was excellent, food was really good and the atmosphere was comfortable.  Plus, since I'm from NYC the prices were reasonable for what we had. Would we dine here again?

Ordered the tuna medium and came out rare.  They redid it but this time was way overcooked.  Ate it anyway.

We had cocktails for about an hour before sitting down for dinner.  Our waiter, Robert, was MIA. Glasses went empty, dishes piled up, one of our party after waiting for awhile went to the bar for water. The bartender apologized and brought us all water. We ordered appetizers, fried calamari and shrimp cocktail. The calamari was luke warm and had a soy based dressing. I requested cocktail sauce which took around 10 minutes. The shrimp were tender and had good flavor. We ordered a Caesar salad to split. My wife enjoyed her portion very much. For me, I didn't think the dressing had much flavor nor enough Parmesan cheese. We ordered stuffed flounder, cedar plank salmon, blackened tuna and the market trio. The flounder and salmon arrived at our table and both were enjoyed. Unfortunately the other two dinners had disappeared. After several minutes the rest of the meals arrived and they were only warm. I had ordered my tuna medium rare. It came rare, Luke  warm and grey in color. I sent it back be warmed up and the manager had the kitchen retire my dinner. Unfortunately it came back pretty much looking the same. I tried it but I really didn't like the look or the flavor. The tuna seemed like it had been frozen. The manager was apologetic and took the tuna and salmon off of the bill. Over all very disappointed. I",

After eating in Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana I finally thought hey, PA has gotta have some good food! Please!!!! Um no. Took my bf here to celebrate his 40th birthday and no one even asked if we were celebrating anything, obviously because no one cares... anyhow, why should y'all? The oysters were good but what a waste of money on the Chilean sea bass and the market trio platter. The sea bass was way salty and the rice was mush along with the cold spinach. The salmon and crab cake were dry, cold and just awful. Good thing I had my wine to wash down the salty fish!  When we finally thought we'd have a decent meal on our vacation....nope. Huge let down. I apologized to my bf for such a crappy birthday dinner. We probably would've been better off eating at Wendy's. After spending over $1,500 on meals only half way through our vacation I'm starting to think fast food would be better!!!! Server was nice but nothing to be wowed about. I still tipped her $18 anyway. Not her fault our food was crap and we didn't tell her. Figured it was towards closing time and should've known we were not gonna get anything good. Blah!",

We were cold because it was 60 degrees and it had rained all day so we wanted to eat in a warm place instead of eating at the festival. I'm so glad we pulled into this place. I think they were short staffed because the waitress apologized for our wait (although it wasn't very long) and it gave use time to look over the menu. We decided to start with the calamari which was outrageously delicious. Light batter coating, fried to perfection, so good. We had both decided to get the Fish and chips.I switched out my chips for their \"smashed potatoes\" and my friend asked for extra coleslaw instead of french fries and we were both glad we did. The smashed potatoes were the best I have ever eaten, they were red potatoes,skin on, gently smashed that were creamy with just amount of lumpiness to have great texture and seasoned perfectly. The coleslaw was the creamy type with good favor and texture. The fried cod was in a light batter and cooked perfectly. Crunchy batter with perfectly cooked and moist on the insides. We were stuffed but the waitress told us the deserts, I had lemon sorbet, and she had the key lime pie. My friend told me that it was better than any key lime pie that she ever had in the Florida  Keys and my lemon sorbet, just delicious with tiny bits of lemon pulp in it.I just couldn't find anything to complain about except the tartar sauce was a bit drab. It was more of a dill mayo than tartar  sauce.",

They do take reservations, but doubtful you need one on a weekday during lunch.  It wasn't busy when I was there on a Tuesday at noon.  Mitchell's has a cool layout - large full bar in the middle, private large rooms for large parties, smaller areas for business lunches, full dining room seating with tables and booths, and an excellent outdoor patio where you can watch people ride by on the bike trail.    This is a seafood restaurant with lots of good options for fresh in season fish.  You can choose from a number of different fish to have prepared for salads, sandwiches, or just as they are.  I had the chopped salad and added scallops to it.  Delicious!    The price range is reasonable and you can plan on spending around $15 with your lunch and a soda/iced tea.  For that price, you really can't complain.  I drop almost that much at Panera on a half sandwich and cup of soup with an iced tea.    I'm sure it's much busier for dinner but I find Mitchell's to be an excellent place for a business lunch or just meeting friends.  I've been here for brunch as well and had an excellent Bloody Mary and eggs benedict with crab.",

    "text": "I want to like this place more than I do. Its definitely at least decent. It's a family style seafood restaurant that has a bit of class to it. Pretty nice visually, and service is good as well, especially at the front desk. I've taken a couple of people there for birthdays and they do a nice job with that without being obnoxious with the ceremony. If you make a birthday reservation you can actually get \"Happy Birthday Bob!\" or whatever printed on your menus for the evening. Nice touch.   Food is just solid, that's why I don't give them more stars. I've had a few things here and there's nothing special about their flavors, although their presentations are nice. I've been a couple of times and haven't had anything I'd be excited about. Basically a safe, family style, classier mid-scale seafood choice.",

I originally ordered the Mahi Mahi but alas, the ran out upon my ordering, in which case the manager promptly came to ask me for another upgraded selection at no additional charge. Hence, the tuna.  Now the tuna was amazing. Seared almost perfectly, with the rare flavor still intact.  I would most definitely come back again and if I lived in the area, this would be one of my top spots.",

The entire meal was a running commentary on where she was and why we didn't even get water refills until dinner came. She had to be specifically asked three times for water before we got our one and only refill.  2) Spilled mussel butter on my jacket and although she did apologize no manager ever came over to see if we were okay. When I did complain they offered a $25 gift card which didn't even cover the cost of said jacket, thanks but no thanks.  3) When asked specifically if a dessert was served warm the waitress said \"yes, of course\" but spoiler alert it wasn't. Party involved said it was fine and asked me not to say something.  4) When asked if they had a very specific after dessert drink the waitress replied in the affirmative only to substitute Irish coffee instead. If you are out of something just own up to it, don't try to pull one over on someone.  Long story short - decent if overpriced food, nonexistent management and the worst service I have experienced in a long while. As a server myself I am pretty forgiving but the (non)service ruined a $150 meal and Mitchell's management couldn't care less.",

Like I get the atmosphere you're trying to go for but I want to be able to see. I got the seafood stew and it was so good. The scallops were perfectly cooked and the flavor of the broth was fantastic. My shrimp were over cooked though, thus the four star review. They got everything right but that one thing kinda tainted it. I had the banana bread pudding for dessert and that was also very good. I've had a lot of bread pudding and this was one of the best. It was light but also dense and the flavor of the banana came through very clearly. Overall I had a very good experience! It would have been very great if it weren't for the over cooked shrimp. I'd definitely go back, but it is pretty pricey.",

    "text": "Every once in a while it's important to indulge in some high-calorie fare.  A few co-workers and I decided that it was time to have some lobsters, so we headed to Mitchell's Fish Market at the Waterfront.   I was excited because it had been years since I had had delicious lobster.  We sat at a table neat the window, and began to look over the menu.  We started with a few Caesar salads (extra anchovies on the side please!), voodoo shrimp, and crab, artichoke and spinach dip.  Our salads arrived first.  The romaine was crisp and sweet, with just enough dressing on the leaves.  I counted two croutons on my salad (seriously?), and there was a small bullet with my furry anchovies.  The salads were topped with parmesan cheese, which added some much needed salt.  Overall, the salads were a great start.  Starters  We decided on spinach, crab and artichoke dip, as well as voodoo shrimp as our appetizers.   15 minutes after ordering, our starters arrived.  I dug into the spinach-crab dip first.  The mixture was creamy, rich, and full of lump crab meat, and tasty chunks of artichoke hearts.  The gooey appetizer was topped with plump, olive oil soaked sun-dried tomatoes; one of my all-time favorite foods. The dip was served in a ceramic crock with a plate, and thin corn style chips for dipping.  I really loved the flavor, but the dip was barely room-temperature; a little more heat and the dish would have been a home run.  The voodoo shrimp were next.  They prawns were plump, and cooked perfectly.  The voodoo-barbecue sauce was much more spicy than anticipated (mas agua por favor!), and was almost too hot for one of our party to eat.  The white rice was a nice accompaniment, and an effective tool for cutting some of the spice.  \"May I clear your dishes please?\"  As we waited for our entrees, I slowly began to calculate how many calories I had ingested thus far.  Wait, probably not a good idea; I can do that after I'm done eating.  Before our lobsters arrived, a server approached our table with three sets of mini-sternos; small metal containers designed to keep our drawn butter warm.  Perfect.  As I watched my butter bubble, all I could do was picture it coursing through my veins... maybe I'll stop for an angioplasty on the way home.  Our lobsters were placed in front of us, and we quickly cracked away.  As I tore the claws off Larry (someone at the table had already named my lobster) I could smell the sweet salty scent of the ocean; it brought back fond memories.  I speared a thick chunk of claw meat, and immersed it in the hot butter.  The tender meat was flavorful and soft... more please!  Everyone at our table was fully engrossed in their meals; it had been a while since they had enjoyed fresh crustaceans as well.    Loaded baked potatoes and grilled asparagus were served with our meals.  Plenty of butter and sour cream slathered our spuds; yum. Only shells remained on our table- a feast fit for kings was had, and we did an excellent job of completing the task at hand.  Our stomachs were full, and we were happily satiated.  \"Would you like to see a dessert menu?\"  Of course we would!  Creme brulee, chocolate cake, 7-layer carrot cake, and shark-fin pie, were among some of the choices.    Since we were all ice cream fans, we decided to try the shark-fin pie. \"This is a big dessert,\" our server warned us, \"It's meant to be shared...\"  He wasn't kidding.  This colossal dessert surprised us all.  It was at least eight inches tall, (no exaggeration) and beautifully presented.  Layers of ice cream, peanut butter, roasted peanuts, peanut butter, ice cream and fresh whipped cream adorned the plate.  We quickly grabbed our spoons from server's hand, and dug in.  The ice cream was thick and delicious.  Large ribbons of frozen peanut butter were layered throughout the pie, and we quickly excavated them like miners digging for precious gold.    It's important to indulge yourself every once in a while.  Although my body is still recovering from the calorie-dense meal, it was well worth it.  Remember, life is short (something I've been becoming more and more aware of lately), and it's important to enjoy yourself once in a while.",

Upon our arrival (party of 2), I asked to see a menu. 20 minutes later we had still not been acknowledged. 4 other groups came came and we're seated as we stood there, looking toward the hostesses expectantly. After quite some time the hostess stared at me, I suppose waiting for me to greet myself. No 'Hello' no 'may I help you?' Finally a curt 'have you been helped?' to which we responded 'no'. The hostess brusquely grabbed two menus, didn't ask whether we were expecting more people, didn't ask whether we wanted a booth or a table (every other patron was offered their preference) and stated FOLLOW ME. She literally threw our menus down on a booth passing by, didn't stop to await us take our seats, didn't introduce or even mention our server or anything. Simply threw our menus down on the table and left, not a word spoken. We didn't remain there long enough to meet our server, which is unfortunate because I was really hoping to have a nice meal there. I will not return.",

    "text": "Mitchell's Fish Market is a very nice place to eat...for a chain restaurant.  And actually, if it wasn't a chain, it wouldn't be too bad either.  The atmosphere was surprisingly pleasant - the room was warm and intimate, perfect for a date.  It wasn't too noisy or too crowded, and we were seated right away on a Friday around 7:30 pm.  Our server was friendly, and happy to give recommendations.  I started with a house salad, which I told the server I would split with my boyfriend.  She brought it to us on two separate plates, which I thought was a nice touch, and more than what I expected.  Poppy seed dressing was okay, it's pretty thick and creamy as I remember, but tasty.  I ordered from the special menu, since they had a bit of a lobster promotion going on.  My entree was a combo: lobster tail, and \"lobster pot pie.\"  Now, lobster is a beautiful thing, but I have to say....it wasn't beautiful here.  It wasn't awful, but it didn't taste as fresh as I like (I'm guessing that's because the meat was frozen originally).  It's just a shame.  Dipping the lobster in butter was a pleasant experience, but it's supposed to be an ecstatic one.  The lobster pot pie was totes not what I imagined.  I pictured a flaky, golden crust, a delicious creamy lobstery gravy, and big hunks of lobster and vegetables.  Instead....I got what sort of resembled a small bread bowl made of a biscuit.  There was a lot of sauce, which was surprisingly orange in color and very rich, with some lobster chunks and vegetables that appeared to come from a bag of frozen veg (I'd recognize those tiny square-shaped carrot chunks anywhere)!  Whaaaaaaaat?  It wasn't bad or anything, but not what I imagined.  I was a little bummed out.    So everything we ate was just fine, and nice when you're craving seafood....but I think in future I'd rather just head to the Strip, get a lobster, and cook the sucker up myself.  I didn't try their fresh preparations, so I can't say how those were.  I'd say in the Waterfront though, it's probably one of your better options.  Healthier and fresher than most of the other choices.  And the atmosphere is great, including the service.",

The server was very kind and attentive, I really like the service. The window view was wonderful and the price is fair for the quality of the food.",

The selection seemed nice, but when the food came, it was only okay. I had the lobster and shrimp stuffed cod. The only spice that I could discern was salt. Hubby also  was not happy given he'd overpaid for fish and chips. Decent bottled beer selection, though. Service was minimal, so it bothered me to have to pay 20% on a $65 bill. The service was fine, nothing exceptional or bad, but because the bill was so high, it just annoyed my I had to pay $13 in tip.",

The room was a tad chilly upon arrival but the waiter had the temp adjusted to correct it quickly. We had a guest arrive a little late, their was no one at the front to escort them back and they kind of walked around lost for a little.      After some internal debate, I settled on the millionaire margarita to drink, didn't love it, but didn't hate it. I ordered the Sam Adams Battered Fish and Chips which came with coleslaw, hush puppies, and french fries. Everything came out really well and on time.       My girlfriends water glass never got refilled.       Overall though, I just wasn't impressed with the atmosphere, for a restaurant that is more pricey than elsewhere, I shouldn't have any gripes. I personally would not come back here if it was my choice.",

Waitstaff is typically pretty good. But they just don't have the wow factor.  It's seafood that's better than Red Lobster, but it doesn't have much character. Like most seafood establishments in Pittsburgh, they do have a good Happy Hour but I'm never in the area that time of day.  The cod with lobster Oscar topping is a prime example. The bernaise sauce is not very good, and neither is the potato hash, but he fish itself is cooked well. Decent appetizers and a good wedge salad, so at a future visit I might stick to finger food.",

Our server was really nice as she kept checking on when we were ready to order. We were excited and had not checked the menu due to the chatter. A couple of ordered the crab cakes with corn and broccoli. The crab cake was hot and delicious with not much filler. The corn tasted as if it was fire roasted. Yum.  One had the salmon and the other had a lobster. Everyone enjoyed their meals. The checks were out promptly and a manager out front actually spent time to take several pictures of our group. Great job.. We will return.",

If the kitchen had a manager, it was certainly not evident as the place was not even half full and we waited well over an hour for our food. Part of the wait was due them running out of entrees and the server coming out suggesting substitutions.   I ordered the chicken which wasn't even made yet when the rest of the party was nearly done eating. The server offered to box it up but at that point I was no longer interested.   While kitchen screw ups on such a light night is difficult to explain, how it was handled by the restaurant manager was even more inexplicable.   It was good that my wife's meal was comped and I didn't need to pay for my coffee and the gumbo That came with the food I didn't get, but it is the  managers responsibility to come out to address issues like this with the customer. Doing so would have motivated me to come back another time , but instead the server was thrown under the bus to address and apologize for issues that were not her fault but that of  the kitchen. The manager never showed his or her face.   Making this very point was that on the receipt under refund was \"server error\" when it was the kitchen screwing everything up. I brought this up to the server and assured her none that of what happened was her fault and gave her a ten for her troubles.   The manager taking 5 minutes to come out and explain things and at least shaking our hands would have redeemed this evening but instead he or she hid in the back. It's a pity because now they lost customers over being discourteous.",

The patio area is great when the weather is nice and I've historically loved the fish preparations.   This last trip, though, was a pretty steep slide downhill.    First, I went to the bar and ordered a glass of the house pinot grigio...a generous poor from a bottle that was definitely a couple days past its prime.   You should know better.     Then onto the table.  I'm pretty sure the hostess double sat the server who was supposed to take care of me, because she expressed her frustration right in the middle of the patio area.  I waiting a few minutes and then someone else ended up taking care of me.   The service was fine, but I was a little put off by the start.  What really got me though was the menu.  Mitchell's used to have a great menu and I've always been thrilled with my selections.  I don't know what changed, but it was something.  I ordered the crispy ginger salmon with stir fried vegetables.   The portion was ample, but the fish was sort of mushy and the crispy ginger topping wasn't crispy at all.  The veges were half overcooked and half undercooked.    If I didn't include this last visit, I'd have given it 4.5 stars.  This last visit brought it down.   Here's hoping that whatever changed, changes back.",

This place seems different to me.  The food quality and care seems to be very high.    The staff is always well trained.  I like the decor and ambiance.  The menu offers many options.  I don't really like the fish preparation options very much and the portions can be small in some of the dishes but overall I am a fan.  I do really appreciate being able to buy fresh fish here.  I like to buy the trout and prepare it at home.    We were here for a Thanksgiving meet-up event with 69 other people.  The room was a little small and it ended up being too loud too but the staff really pulled it off overall.  It's a tough thing to do.

    "text": "Going to make this quick. 2 stars only because the waitress was the only good part. Waited 45+ min to get our table we had reservations for, waited over an hour to get our food which then was missing a dinner because they ran out of \"steak\".  In that time, no one came to us to tell us they ran out of something and that someone wouldn't have a dinner when everyone was finally presented their dinners. (Mother's Day by the way) The people that got the filets were presented with a pitty poor excuse for a steak that should have cost $15 max. However, Our waitress was very polite and professional and luckily the manager decided to comp the bill. But whoever is running the kitchen an is in charge of orders, needs fired. This place has gone down hill SO much it's not even funny. Way too many major errors an I think it's time for an evaluation of staff. Used to love this place, but we won't be back. I'd go into the quality of the food, but at this point it's not even necessary. Get it together",

    "text": "We went to Mitchell's last weekend to celebrate my BFF's birthday.  She has been to Mitchells several times and speaks highly about it.  I have been there before but is has been several years and really didn't recall much.  But like my friend I love seafood so there was no objections there.  The menu isn't too big, which is good, and they allow you to choose sides vs giving you what they deem you should have with your meal.  Our waitress was very nice. We arrived a little after my friend, but waited about 15 minutes for her other friend and date to show.  Once settled in we all placed our orders.  I decided on a yellowfin tuna, prepared medium rare, and for the sides I requested a double order of asparagus.  We didn't wait too long for our 6 meals to arrive.  However, 3 out of 6 of those contained mistakes.  My BFF asked for coleslaw.  Not there.  Easy fix they brought it out.  My husband wanted fries, he got potatoes.  Ok so now he gets both for same price, so I guess another easy fix.  And then there was me.  They just straight up brought me someone else's food.  The waitress quickly grabbed it up after I said to the guy this isn't what I ordered.  There was rice on the plate, and I don't know what fish since it only sat in front of me for a few seconds before being snatched away.  I only waited a few minutes and she brought me my correct meal.  The yellowfin looked amazing.  Nice thick portion, and once I cut into it, it was beautifully cooked and seasoned well.  However, my \"double\" order of asparagus was FIVE spears.  Before the waitress left after bringing the correct order I said something to her about it.  That to which she said, \"That is a double\".  Hmmm.  So a single order is 2 and  1/2 pieces of asparagus right?  That's bunk.  My fellow diners felt sorry for me and offered up some of their veggies, very sweet of them.  Weird thing was, my friend's other friends date ordered asparagus as one of his sides and got 4 pieces.  So was it just me or maybe they need some help executing in the kitchen and in service.  Not to mention the meal was $32.00, and I just bought a bundle of asparagus for 1.88 at the Giant Eagle!    So other than the mix-ups and the asparagus situation of 2016, I really enjoyed my meal and time at Mitchells.  The fish was as noted very tasty, but the price is reflective of a special occasion dinner option.",

Our visit started with the hostess arguing with another member of the staff, they tried to keep it down but unsuccessfully. The food  menu is a one sided piece of paper with the drink menu on the back. My wife and I both wanted surf and turf, but that did not exist on their menu. We found something that sounded good and hoped for the best. The salmon lacked any flavor at all, the crab cakes had too much of whatever spice was in it and the asparagus was either undercooked or  old. The mashed potatoes were the only good food we ate of appetizers, salad, and main course. The only other pluyI can think of was our server. Next time I will spend way less and get more food that tastes good.",

    "text": "After doing some chores at The Waterfront, we were hungry and decided to try Mitchell's for dinner. We were seated at a comfortable red booth. The clam chowder was perfect; definitely get it. The mussels were delicious--not as firm as mussels usually are (but in a good way) and bigger than normal. The spicy crispy shrimp surprised me; I didn't think it would be good, but it was. Boyfriend said his lobster bisque was \"funky\" and I agreed that it tasted weird, but it was still edible.   The calamari, however, was unseasoned. Maybe they forgot to season it that night? I feel like the way it was served to us is not the way they usually serve it. Also, I was disappointed with the small portion of the calamari. For $12, we should be getting way more than we did.   Our server was attentive and noticed that we liked a lot of their appetizers, so she informed us about their happy hour (Monday through Friday 4:30-6:30pm) where their appetizers are at most $7 each! Tempting, especially after our pleasant dinner experience.  Taste | 4 Atmosphere | 4 Presentation | 3.5 Service | 4 OVERALL | 4",

We paid $14 for five pieces of overcooked shrimp in the cocktail, and $11 for a musty tasting mussel Provencal with quite a few dead and utterly inedible mussels.  The fisherman's platter entree was at least edible, though the fries were generic (Think Ore Ida's).  The King Crab legs were cold, old, and skimpy for a $33 entree.  They were also bizarrely cut down the middle, perhaps as part of a nefarious ploy to fill the plate with more mediocrity.  All in all the seafood was consistently disappointing and only a few shades away from being actually poisonous.  The only saving grace is the excellent service and gorgeous patio which at least meant we could enjoy our loathsome meal in a pleasant atmosphere.  Maybe there's a reason millennials are letting places like this die.    Side note: the hush puppies and smashed potatoes were actually quite nice which only makes the rest of the meal all the more pathetic in contrast.",

I won't write poorly about the wait staff only because they know how bad this place is and they're just doing their job. The food is old and not fresh. I had the cup of clam chowder and it was fair, as was the sourdough bread, but honestly these items I'm sure were premade elsewhere. I had fresh oysters 3 of which I regret eating, thinking well the next one will be better. They ran the brine from them and were not cut properly from the shell. I had the beer battered (Sam Adam's) shrimp, same thing, the next one will be better, I ate 2. (This was the Long John Silver's I was referring to) and if anybody knows that experience it comes back around on you. So gross, wasn't even remotely sea worthy tasting. Such regret.  My husband had french fries and although those managed to be tasty, his stir fried vegetables were edible however tasteless. He is a vegetarian and there were not many options and he got burned and I feel bad I dragged my family there. My poor son just ordered a caesar salad, how can they screw up a salad? well they managed it. Sadly strewn about a dinner plate looking more like a garnish for a Christmas Ham, sliding off the plate with every fork stabbing attempt, mushy crouton mixed with hard over toasted ones.   Just a sad day at Mitchell's, years ago it was a favorite.  Despite the manager comping the check, I let him know that we will never come back to this establishment again. Its simply overpriced delivering less than fast food quality. Honestly I'd rather eat at McDonald's. Close the doors you are not worthy of people's hard earned money.",

    "text": "So, my sister Luch and I received gift cards to this restaurant for Christmas.  We decided that we would go on a quiet Sunday afternoon and wrap ourselves up in a seafood cocoon.  The decor of the place is your basic upscale \"seafood shanty\" style.  Brass accents and hardwood floors, you know this type of place.  Since we had reservations, we were seated quickly.  My sister had never been to the restaurant before and I haven't been there in quite some time.  Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and very helpful in assisting us with making our selections.  When it comes to seafood, I'll eat almost anything and I wanted something yummy.  My sister, on the other hand is extremely picky.  Since we were starving, we both decided to order appetizers.  My sister ordered the \"Spicy Crispy Shrimp\" (Shrimp with creamy chili glaze, sticky rice and pickled cucumbers) and I ordered the \"Maryland Style Crab Cake\" served with roasted corn, tabasco mash remoulade and traditional tartar\".  We also received a warm loaf of sourdough bread and butter.  Ahhhh, I love warm bread and butter. (I hate the fact that a lot of restaurants charge extra for this accompaniment, but I'm still a sucker for warm bread.)  The Spicy Crispy Shrimp were a gentler version of another restaurant's \"Bang-Bang Shrimp\" dish.  The sauce leaned more creamy than spicy and the tempura batter was a little thicker that I like, but it was a decent dish.  The Maryland Style Crab Cake on the other hand was entirely too salty.  I like crab cakes that are composed mainly of crab meat with just enough of a binder to hold the thing together.  The crab cake passed that test but failed on the seasoning test.  It was so salty that it actually distracted from the rest of my meal. Bleh!  For our entrees, my sister ordered Chili Glazed Salmon with asparagus and I ordered the dinner Prix Fixe meal with Lobster Bisque, Triple Shrimp and Banana Bread Pudding as my dessert. (I know that I ordered a lot of food, but didn't I say from the start that we were starving?)  My sister's salmon was perfectly cooked as well as the asparagus.  The tempura shrimp that were a part of my Triple Shrimp entree, were light and not greasy. (That's why I don't usually order tempura shrimp)  Additionally, the bacon wrapped shrimp portion was also tasty.  My Triple Shrimp was served with a side of jambalaya rice and veggies.  Both were okay. (I'm a little spoiled when it comes to rice.  I like to see individual grains, but the dish had a good flavor.)  Overall, we were pleased with our meals (except the crabcake).  And if you order one of the Prix Fixe meals, you definitely can't go wrong.",

    "text": "Came here because the menu had a lot of promise. I decided to eat at the bar. I ordered the Cabernet and ahi tuna from the happy hour special. While delicious, I thought the ahi tuna was small (super thin slices), even for a reduced price of $10. The Cabernet was a very excellent choice at $6. My biggest complaint (besides the price/portion) was the service. I felt like there was no attention made to me after I ordered my food. A prime example was that I had to ask for a water refill, after having it be empty for several minutes. And when I asked for the check, the bartender was a little snotty telling me it was already folded up in a glass near where I sat. I don't think I'll come back, even though the menu did seem to have good variety.",

I work in customer service and would love to have an employee like her. Their menu seemed promising with great options and prices. When ordering, some of the happy hour food options were no longer offered. The food was sub par when we finally received it (we ordered several items). Our initial bartender Tay was obviously new (it took him a very long time to make drinks off the menu) but had a great personality and a great attitude. When our initial bartender left we had Kaley. She seemed to lack the social skills most bartenders have. Kaley was not engaging to the bar patrons without being engaged. We probably won't be returning to Mitchell's anytime soon",

We got the lobster Mac n cheese as a side but I was too full and Brought it to my mom instead. She said it was delicious! I ordered banana bread pudding for dessert because I can't resist banana and it was a cute little single serving dessert that was yummy.

Started out with a half dozen raw oysters. They were disgusting and flavorless. Bacon wrapped bbq shrimp was a little better not much. The entrees were terrible as well my son had salmon. He said it was flavorless. But the kicker was $44 for the smallest portion ever of Alaskan King Crab Legs. They can't even serve with proper drawn butter. I ordered hollandaise for the asparagus and it was cold. Despite this we ordered dessert. We had the Sharkfin pie. It would have been good except it was freezer burned and the bottom layer was hard as a rock. This place is so awful.  Service was ok. I guess there were guests at the booth in front of us that the staff knew so they were constantly hovering around that table with the hostess even sitting down with the guests during her shift. Even the manager was hovering around the table. That was pretty annoying. Red Lobster is better and cheaper. And when you have top notch options in the city like like Luke Wholeys, Merchant Oyster Co, and Muddy Waters no reason to waste money on this garbage.",

I really like the food here, which keeps us coming back again and again.  I think that management needs improved in some areas, but that doesn't keep me from enjoying the food.   On several occasions we have had new servers that really needed to have the senior server follow them until they are comfortable with service. The new servers get distracted or confused and it is not a good dining experience when you have to explain or worry about what the server has forgotten or will not deliver. Okay that's the negative, on to the good stuff.  We return because we love seafood, and the quality here is good. We belong to the resultant group and rewards program. I also receive points by making the reservation on Open Table. The gift cards and points from the restaurant group help absorb some of the cost.  Mitchell's is a wonderful restaurant for special occasions as well as date night with a movie.We have come as a family or as a couple.   Despite what some have commented on, the price is comparable to other seafood restaurants of this quality. Walking through the door of a restaurant like this, you should expect the higher price for the quality of what you receive.   I like dining here and Highly Recommend.  I love the Salmon !",

The food perse has gone down hill since it first opened but  tonight  we could have gone out to the Mon and caught it faster and cooked it ourselves for what happened on UNHAPPY hour.  The restaurant was not busy.  The bar was not busy.   Our server took orders for part of the table, delayed in returning to take other orders,  then came back and took a few more.  Four of the 13 had their food, the others did not.  Two of my guests got up and left because it took so long, another cancelled her order again, it never came out, and I had one lady that after we had all eaten - still had not gotten her sandwich.  The waitress seemed to think this was ok, however, she never got to come back and get additional drinks, we had to go to the bar ourself and get waited on.  We could not even exit - each of us had to go to the bar and ask the bartender to check us out.  I actually asked to see the manager because I wanted a face to face communication and perhaps the server needed more training, or at least give the manager the opportunity to make it right.......I sat an additional 20 minutes waiting for a manager, and no one ever came over to offer an explaination, to apologize for the poor service....nada.  zip.    The sad thing is this group has been there at least 3 other occasions and we spend money and tip well.  not tonight.  not ever again.  I would not recommend this restaurant for any reason.  Poor service, poor management.",

I frequent this area for business travel, and you can't do much better without heading downtown.  The seafood is excellent, with a daily menu crammed full of fresh fish specials, a raw bar, and a list of chef's specialties.  The house salad is sweet and delicious, and the 'shanghai' seafood preparation is delicious, healthy, and unique.  Try it with the scallops or a white-fleshed fish.  There is a nice selection of regional beers on tap, a decent selections of wines, and creative drinks (think elderflower and pear martinis).  The deserts are adequate, though not a highlight.

The food is fantastic and the service cannot be beat, at least not when it's coming from the Governor or Kennedy. Best servers in the 'burgh!! I took my Dad there last weekend for his 70th birthday, didn't tell anyone that it was a special night out, but they treated us with such attention, accommodating our needs to a T. Kennedy adjusted meals to fit our taste, suggested things based on what we were looking for, took at least 10 minutes with us going over the menu...I could go on, but needless to say, it was just a fabulous meal and was worth every penny. We got the king crab and bacon wrapped shrimp to start, lobster bisque soup, cedar plank salmon, Chilean sea bass, and a fish medley made to order. We also always get the 7 layer carrot cake, which to me is the best cake anywhere in town.  A must go for anyone looking for an amazing meal and excellent service.

Others had the clam chowder, which was yummy. For dinner we enjoyed the Seafood Sampler Shang Hai style and Cedar-Plank Salmon.  My 1.5-year-old son loved the broiled cod and green beans from the children's menu, which had a great selection. I was happy to see the children's menu had an option that wasn't fried and wasn't mac and cheese! My son also really liked the coloring/activity booklet they provided along with a packet of triangle-shaped crayons! I was impressed at how prepared this restaurant was for little diners.

    "text": "I need to say right away that I am not a seafood guy. Unfortunately, I come from a seafood-obsessed family, so I often end up getting dragged off to restaurants that serve nothing but that--thus, one afternoon I came to eat at the Fish Market @ the Waterfront.   From the outside, the Market doesn't seem like anything special, but the interior of the place was quite nice. We had reserved the private back room, and it was very spacious and tastefully decorated.   Anti-fish as I am, I wasn't really expecting to be wowed at this place. But I was wrong. For an appetizer, we ordered a plate of hushpuppies....I would like to graphically describe to you our reaction to them, but this is a G rated site I think, so I won't. Anyway, they were delicious! and we ordered about 2394293 more plates of them after the initial one was devoured.   Luckily, there was a solitary non-seafood item on the menu--filet mignon. I am not crazy about steaks either, but it's better than fish, so that's what I ordered. It was the best filet that I've ever had, and I've been to Morton's, Ruth Chris', Ditka's, etc. It was just absolutely bursting with flavor. Omg.   Lastly, we got some dessert...which I can't even remember, because the steak and the hushpuppies were so great. I think I got some sort of apple tart thing....but who can say. I bet it was good though.  The sole drawback to my experience was our server....apparently, we drew the lotto and struck out by getting an absolutely crazy server that day. I felt sorry for her, actually, because she seemed like she was just super stressed out and on the verge of a meltdown....but still. She took a loooooooong time to bring us our food, and I vividly recall her returning after we had already eaten, and asking us what appetizers we would like 0.0; clearly, she wasn't on planet earth that day.  Anyways, the place was good and normally the service probably is too, so I highly recommend it.",

We were both eating lite since a) I was dieting and b) my family was having dinner at my mother's house and she was slaving over lasagna all day, so if anyone knows anything about Italian mother's, you better arrive hungry. Back to mitchell's, I had the iceberg wedge with bacon, egg, tomatoes and a delicious home made blue cheese dressing. I also ordered a bowl of seafood gumbo which was the best gumbo I ever tasted. It wasn't overly packed with rice, as a matter of fact, there wasn't much rice at all. It was mostly shredded crab, scallops, and shrimp with a very delicate broth that wasn't too thick and the heat snuck up on you after swallowing. It wasn't a lot of heat, just enough to make it exciting. As for the iceberg wedge salad, every once in awhile I need a piece of iceberg instead of a bowl of spring mix (ie: tender weeds). The star of this salad was the chef made blue cheese dressing. It was not overly thick, very tasty and savory. It complimented the bacon and egg on the wedge. The cousin ordered the carrot cake for dessert and it was easily a pound slice. I tasted a little bite and must say it's the best carrot cake I've ever tasted. The cream cheese frosting was more buttery than \"cheesy\", it was a great surprise when you're expecting the normal cream cheese frosting. There were whole walnuts throughout the cake and many raisins, which I love. Also this recipe seems to rely on more cinnamon than I've tasted in the past. I highly recommend it. It was a wonderful lunch and I'm sure she had carrot cake to take on the plane ride back to Riverside.",

We love coming to this restaurant. Don't forget a reservation on weekends. You will not get a table and will probably wait an hour or two if you don't have one. We never get to the dessert. Always too full to eat dessert.   Forgot to take pictures.",

The quality is completely gone, portions are smaller, prices higher. From what I read it's a company change, but how could this make a place go from wonderful to horrible so quickly? The server even tried pushing a diners club program on us!!! Who would pay for a dining program to this place!?!? That's right, I said pay! The company wants you to pay for a membership! Why should a loyal customer pay to be rewarded for being LOYAL??? Why would anyone even pay for such lousy food? The place is not even kept up anymore. The atmosphere has become dingy and even the dish my $30 + meal came out on felt grimy!!! My silver was even wrapped in torn linens! Where is the management? How can they allow such expensive meals to go out on dirty dishes? Where has my wonderful night out gone? I use to look forward all week to when having a night out here. Now I don't even want to drive past! Even the staff is miserable anymore. Everyone use to be so pleasant and welcoming, and now they seem run down and well, miserable. I've come back now 3 times hoping my experiences were flukes, unfortunately this place is just not what it use to be! I'm sad knowing my favorite restaurant is now gone!Do yourself a favor and don't waste your hard earned money here. You will be nickeled and dimed for everything only to receive nasty frozen sea food on dirty dishes with ratty linens, from miserable workers.",

The interior is a classic, clean, modern seafood restaurant-- dark wood, glass, etc... The menu has really great seafood selections and is printed daily.  But here's what's great about this place: after 4pm you can get \"small plates\" at the bar for $3 each, and these ain't no Costco fish sticks! Two of these small plates would make a sufficient meal (along with the sourdough French bread they bring out). Finally, while the drinks aren't cheap, they're creative, tasty and fresh. All in all, I had a great experience, and I think this place would be perfect for a date or a happy hour with the girls from the typing pool.",

    "text": "This is one of the few restaurants I frequent in the Waterfront. Why would you come to Mitchell's if not for the fish/seafood? You probably wouldn't. But you can swim in the Great Lakes beer on tap here and have some nice oysters while enjoying river view. Not many places in Pittsburgh offer these types of views while dining (and that's a Pittsburgh mystery to me). The restaurant is never to crowded and you won't get packed in like sardines in a tin can. So you can enjoy a fairly romantic dinner with your loved one(s).   The food is very good but you may have to shell out a few clams of your own ($$$). If you have deep ocean like pockets put your hook into the  sea bass which is always moist and scrumptious at around $29.99. They will cook your food one of several ways. I like my fish broiled, their signature is too salty for my liking. Bread is mmmgood and hot (free). Staff is very  accommodating ie you can request to sample a soup and the servers are pleased to do so. I recommend you try their soups like the seafood gumbo. A bowl of this creamy delight goes a long way...bonus they toss in those little hexagonal oyster crackers as  reminds me of my youth on Long Island's south shore (but that's another story). Salads a bit skimpy and somewhat pricey (approx. $7.95 for basic house salad). Bottom line is Mitchell's at the Waterfront is well worth taking the splash for if you really like a nice seafood dinner.",

We parked our bikes and were seated promptly at the patio. The waitress even filled our water bottles for us! The interior of the restaurant is very nice, sea-themed, and clean. The decor is really tasteful and classy. The outside was perfect. It was Sunday afternoon and the weather was gorgeous. Looking out to a serene part of the river is fabulous as well. Our waiter was professional, knowledgeable and friendly. We decided just on a few drinks and an app. The two drinks my bf ordered were AMAZING. The first, muddled basil, grapefruit juice and vodka (I forget the name). SO refreshing! the basil was flavorful and tasted awesome with the grapefruit juice. The second he got was a frothy pineapple-vodka with a huge fresh chunk of pineapple inside. Both were winners. I stuck with a fairly priced white wine but got to test his fun drinks :) The app we got was the Hawaiian Seared Ahi Tuna and it was delicious as well. It was a pretty decent size to split, and came with sushi rice, a red onion/cucumber relish, ginger and wasabi. I believe the tuna was also drizzled with ponzu. It was so good - definitely recommend! My bf couldn't help himself so he also ordered a cup of lobster bisque, which I don't eat, but he said it was very good. He also polished off some of the warm bread loaf that accompanied our meal. This place definitely earns the stars and I had no idea it was even a chain. The waiter said they were expanding, so hopefully the quality and service don't go down. I also checked out the rest of the menu and they use quality ingredients and the prices really aren't bad (it was the lunch menu - I'm sure the dinner menu is pricier.) I felt like I was on vacation and I'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "First time in Pittsburgh on biz and staying in the Waterfront District. Nice selection of better than average chain restaurants on the area. Spotted Mitchell's Seafood and since I never heard of ot before, decided to make it my evening dinner choice - in fact, looked forward all day to a nice shellfish dinner ala Bonefish Grill. They have a nice al fresco patio overlooking the River that I wish I say at.  Place was pretty empty at 8 pm on a Monday night, but that's to be expected. I ordered the Seafood Americana which was supposed to have sauteed shrimp and scallops in a light butter sauce. What I got in return was a plate of small shrimp in a brown gravy with NO scallops whatsoever. I immediately returned the dish and the young and nice manager came over to make it right, so I reordered a different steamed shrimp and scallops dish which was much better- 5 larger shrimp and 5 sea scallops over spinach and veggies with a soy sauce on the side - very nice but wish they had drained the ingredients better so they didn't end up on a soupy broth.  Having waited tables in a high end seafood restaurant through graduate school I am tempted to attributing this experience to Monday night, late dinner, inexperienced cooks, and lack of kitchen or server oversight. I hope your experience is better than mine. Too many other good choices nearby to give them a second chance - sorry.  Disappointed.",

I was looking for a fish place in town again, and figured, after reading positive reviews that it had improved. Yikes. Bad decision.   The staff seemed put out that anyone was here at all, and were seemingly puzzled by the menu. I watched two bartenders trying to figure out how to make a strawberry daiquiri for 5 minutes, which was admittedly entertaining.   I ordered the chowder and the crab cakes. The chowder was basically flour stew with potatoes. I'm guessing that there may have been a clam or two in there somewhere, but you couldn't taste it if there was through the flour.   The crab cakes were definitely frozen, and not made from blue crab. If you're going to offer Chesapeake crab cakes, they had damn well better be the real deal. Zero flavor and dry as hell. Stringy, Asian crab that was definitely pre-made. Terrible.   I don't like to rip a spot, but this was a seriously weak restaurant. Don't know why I expected western PA to offer up the goods, but if Chicago can do it well, why not Pittsburgh. Best analogy- the Olive Garden of seafood",

We had remembered Mitchell's Fish Market as excellent for seafood, as well as (surprisingly) steak. Wow, were we disappointed!!!!!  The near-empty parking lot at 8:00 PM on a Friday was the first clue. The misunderstandings about the reservation and being treated accusingly by the front greeters who were arguing with each other was the second clue.  The lack of availability of the first 3 choices we made from the menu was the third clue.  The shoe really dropped when the food came.  Both my blackened cod, the steamed vegetables with it and the side of asparagus in hollandaise were ALL cold, dry and hard.  The cod portion was tiny.  MY partner's fillet of beef ordered \"medium rare to medium well with some pink\" was black on the outside, dry, cold and very well done.  Others in our party of six had similar experiences with just plain tough batter-dipped and greasy fried fish for one and cold, dry, small portion of \"fresh\" fish for another.  We were told that this place had changed management in the past 5 years.  In light of its poor quality of food at upscale prices, Mitchell's Fish Market deserves to fail and close.",

Here's a rundown of the evening:  Pros: - super friendly waitress, Stephanie, who maintained her professionalism and friendliness throughout  - yummy elderflower and pear beverage - lobster bisque was nice and lobster-y - hot delicious bread  Cons: - oysters were sketch. And I don't feel good about that. Stephanie brought us an order of East Coast oysters to replace the West Coast ones that we sent back. - fresh grated horseradish had NO flavor or heat- what's up with that? - scallops were meh- came with weird veggies, unevenly seared, and no real flavor. And at a whopping $25 a plate, I expect some nummers!  I doubt we'll go back- for those prices, I would prefer McCormick's or Ruth's Chris.",

I wish we had selected to seat outside the view was wonderful, but maybe next time. Mitchells is a little bit pricey, but I think its worth it. I had the mussels as my appetizer they were delicious just wish there was a little more of them. Since I did not feel the appetizer was enough I ordered a lobster bisque soup. The soup was ok, but I have had way better lobster bisque before. Then I ordered shrimp and Andouille jambalaya it was pretty good. Finally for desert I ordered creme Brule it was fantastic. I ordered a pineapple coconut mojito as well it was good, but not nearly as good as the mojitos in south beach :(. I would recommend though. :)",

Of the 4 types of reviews I give (awesome, OK, bad where they get slammed and bad where I hope they improve) here I am giving the heartfelt \"bad where I hope they improve.\"  Our waitress was very friendly and did a good job.  I mentioned the gritty redskins of the mashed potato.  We went with appetizers she recommended.  Not good.    Seared ahi tuna: horrible flavors mixed with the rub, the prep, the tuna wasn't cool inside, the chips were not good, there was no soy sauce but there was wasabi.  NOT good.  With heartfelt advice, compare this against Outback's ahi tuna appetizer and it's no contest.  The chef should do so.  (He's a nice guy like me I hope.)    BBQ shrimp: go try Redstone's (Philly) buffalo shrimp appetizer.  It is chilled, very delicious.  This appetizer was recommended and was garbage.  The barbecue sauce was horrible, overwhelmed and left an unsavory aftertaste in both my and my clients' palate.  Gordon Food Service or Sysco BBQ sauce.  A real \"must-miss\".    Cod entree was OK.  The skillet beans were too firm, too mature, they need petite green beans.  Potato skin had grit in the mashed.  Why 1 star?  The price was close to Capital Grille, but far from the cuisine.  I hope they spruce it up.  The place is nice.",

Oh, and if you get the carrot cake....one is enough for everyone! It was huge, and it was soooo goood! I don't know how they can make something taste that good and cook it in such large volumes. Really was an excellent experience, my only reason for not giving it a five star review was that there was too much time in between our courses. There was probably a good 40 minutes that passed between our salads and our entrees. That's a little long for me when I'm at a brunch. Usually I don't eat a breakfast if I'm going to something like that, so 40 minutes was too long for me.",

We were seated in a picture perfect spot by the window as requested. Our waiter initially greeted us warmly but the service went south quickly and I trying to wrap my head around - Why?   What was wrong with the service you wondered. Well..... *We had to wait a long time for our drinks  *appetizers ordered but not received. * Requested bread several times waiter was oblivious to the request  * Dinner took for ever it felt like a century later  It was good thing we was on vacation so we had time to waste.  We observed the other waiters and waitress was busy attending to their patrons.  On the plus side the food was divinely delicious!  Salmon, scallops- Super fresh and melted in my mouth.  My husband's dish ordered the Shrimp and Crab Cakes and he hummed  yum to every bite he ate.  Unfortunately service and excellent service should go hand and hand.  If only the head manager who was consistently walking around to various tables talking to patrons would have stop at our table we could have given him the scoop about our lack of service.  On well.",

    "text": "This is a really hard review for me to write, simply because I cannot for the life of me find the words to explain the food. Lackluster, no, not really...Mediocre...no....Pedestrian/average/common...huh uh. Just 'eh.' It wasn't awful, terrible or even bad, and it wasn't great, good or even fine. It was just....edible, I guess.   We started with shrimp dumplings from the happy hour menu and the BF got seafood gumbo. I thought the gumbo was decent; he said 'eh', however we both agreed the dumplings were 'eh'.  I got something called the market trio, which came with creole style rice, corn, a crab cake, a hunk of salmon and 5 shrimp. It wasn't terrible, inedible food, it was just....not good. And for $28 I wish I would have just gotten a bowl of the gumbo. The only thing that seemed to have any flavor was the rice. The BF got a crab and lobster stuffed cod, which again, was not bad just not good. It had a lemony-buttery sauce, that didn't taste quite lemony or buttery somehow.  I know this is a stupid thing to gripe about, but I hatehatehate when restaurants charge necessarily high prices for pop. Soda, cola, pop, call it what you want, but it should never be more than $2.50. I usually just drink water with lemon, but I had a headache, so I ordered a coke. $325!! And having a BF who works for a restaurant, I know that pop costs them pennies! I see $2-2.50; some people drink glass after glass of the stuff, but $3.25 is simply ridiculous. Especially when the food kinda sucks. And I read other reviews and the decor is not classy. It's like it's trying to be classy, but real classy restaurants know its' not classy. It was a little like an over-priced, under-flavored Red Lobster without the kickass cheese biscuits. But when your food sucks at Red Lobster, you can always fill up on the delicious biscuits.",

My friend has a shell food allergy and is catholic.  He could choose only one thing - the salmon which was acceptable. I too was limited with my allergies.  My husband asked to have the special for one and they \"couldn't accomodate.\" The 2 salads they offered were a caesar and a boring house salad, which was all ice berg lettuce.  (On other nights, they have really good salads) Why not offer those for Valentine's Day? The food tasted OK. Mashed potatoes were awesome. My husband asked for no asparagus but roasted veggies.  He received the asparagus and a side of steamed veggies. Desserts were fine except due to my allergies I could only get the boring creme brulee.  I am so sick of Creme Brulee at restaurants as my only choice that I usually do not have dessert.  Service was slow and inconsistent. we were not the only table with issues.  The table beside us a child ordered pasta with alfreaedo sauce.  He received his pasta plain! YUCH!  This restaurant previously was one we would go to when at the Waterfront but after the last 2 trips, I see why they are not busy.  I am rethinking booking this restaurant for Christmas Eve.",

Upon entering the restaurant was extremely busy, with a good bit of people in the waiting area. We arrived at 6:25 and immediately checked in. 6:30 came, same amount of people still in waiting area. 6:45, the 6:30 reservations were still waiting to be seated. We spoke to hostess at 6:55 and promised us we were 2nd in line. 3 tables were seated before us. The hostess looked flustered, confused, and not interested in helping to rectify situation. At 7:05 we were finally sat.  Our server was excellent. Came by often to refill waters and take new drink orders. Helped us with our menu questions and gave suggestions. Our appetizer came out quickly with enough of a gap between our entrees which is always a plus! I got the Shanghai Chilean SeaBass. Cooked perfectly!!

The $27 for six small scallops (quarter sized) which were halved and skewered for some reason (too small to flip and the attempt to look like a larger portion epic fall l). Taste was good size ridiculously small for the price.  My entree was the fish shrimp and chips.  Normally I get everything broiled. This time I went with the fried. Well. The fish. 4 small strips of cod. Was oily/greasy. The grease dominated everything. I couldn't even bare to eat more than 1 shrimp.  They were soaked in grease and were mushy.   Service was below average.  When the Waitress asked how the food was I told her it was of by no means good. The amount of grease and the lack of flavor. Her reply sorry and ran away.  Never.

I knew something was wrong when there were 10 cars in the lot, on a beautiful Friday night at 7pm. I should have followed my instincts.   Drinks (12.50 each) were fine so were the bartenders. But the food and prices were ridiculous ! 2 entrees, sea bass and blackened scallops. 4 drinks and 1 appetizer. $151.00 + tip. Trust me, go to Applebees and you will get better food and I hate chain restaurants.    Sea Bass.. tasteless with bland rice and nasty spinach. Blackened Scallops.. not blackened and tiny with 3 spears of asparagus.  I usually would never go to a chain, but we did for convenience.  I can eat at some of the Burghs best restaurants for Mitchell's prices and walk away saying WOW.    This place needs a serious face lift and needs a new head chef. OR... price your food like it should be. These entrees were worth about $12.00, instead of $35.00.  I have never been to Eat and Park, but I am sure you will get better food there.  This is my first Yelp review. I had to create a profile just to write about this place.  I know food is a crap shoot, but the managers and owners of Mitchell's should be ashamed of what they serve and charge.   Close the doors or just get a clown for a mascot and price your food like a below average restaurant.",

    "text": "I love eating in the beautiful river setting (though it is right by where the bloody Homestead Steel Strike took place in 1892).  I would have given this place a higher rating based on past visits.  But my most recent experience was not quite as good.  The waitress spoke too fast, and gave me misinformation about what sides came with the plank of fish.  She did offer to fix the mistake, but I let it go and traded sides with another person who was with me. I think broiled is better than the plank.  I still will eat at Mitchell's at least once each time I visit Pittsburgh.  The food is healthy, and I enjoy being there.",

The sourdough bread they serve is always hot and fresh. The Chilean sea bass just melts in your mouth, it was awesome. The Cod stuffed with shrimp and lobster was also very good. I had the carrot cake for dessert, it is big enough for 3 people. It was so delicious. My friend had the creme  brulee, which she said was very good. I was here 3 times this summer and every meal was excellent.",

    "text": "I've had good meals here in the past but not this evening. Ordered the Chilean sea bass which is approximately $37. It was a surprisingly small piece for that price and not very thick. The portions of the sides were extremely skimpy as well. Despite a long row of empty tables except one, the rather cold hostess put us at a table right by the kitchen's in and out doors and the large open window facing into the kitchen. Staff constantly came and went within a foot of us and the kitchen staff talked and screamed out food order pick ups needed. It was a poor meal, high cost and bad atmosphere. Refuse a seating in that area, and avoid the higher priced entrees as they might not be worth the price. Better yet, go to Longhorn nearby for a great steak that's fairly priced and consistent quality, ample portions of sides. Leave full not hungry!",

Then I asked a friend if they had ever heard of it and they had, and liked it.  I was pleasantly surprised by how nice the ambiance was inside.  Very cozy.  Much more upscale than I had thought it would be.  The service was terrific.  Lots of things to choose from on the menu.  A bit pricier than I had imagined.  Most entrees were anywhere from $17 to $30.  But this is Pittsburgh and this is seafood.  That said, they started us off with really delicious sour dough bread.  Butter was soft which I like.  Our entrees came pretty quickly.  I had a seafood assortment of blackened talapia, grilled sea scallops and salmon cooked on a plank.  The scallops were just done, I like them cooked a little more.  Everything else was pretty good. My beloved had the crab cakes and really enjoyed them.  We'll probably be back, but will order something different.   We liked it.",
