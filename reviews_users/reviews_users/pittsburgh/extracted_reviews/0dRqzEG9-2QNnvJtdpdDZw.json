The quality of the food is still good, the staff are nice, but I did notice that the restaurant is not as kept as the location in Oakland. There were dirty and disheveled tables, overflowing trashcans, and the floor was littered with food crumbs and napkins. They should have at least one employee designated for the upkeep of the dining area, as with the Oakland branch. I stopped in around 3:30 in the afternoon at a very unbusy time, so there was no reason why the dining area wouldn't look its best. Nevertheless, I would still stop in again sometime.",

Their Fuji Apple Chicken Salad is better than most other Panera locations... their baked goods, however, leave something to be desired. Why would you put chocolate sprinkles on a chocolate croissant?

Most of the employees & managers know my favorite Fuji Apple Salad, no chx, sub avocado.  As a non-Pitt & non-CMU Student, this is my favorite location to do school work because the majority of the students are hogging the Oakland Panera Bread wifi.  If you are an online student as well, this is a less crowded Panera and you sure will find an open outlet without any hassle.  I highly recommend the Fuji Apple Chx Salad, No chx, substitute Avocado along with Panera's fresh brewed hazelnut coffee.  -Amberlee",

Once you reassemble the mess it tastes pretty good and they have good ice tea but its north worth the hassle and nasty attitudes of the employees there.  BTW, the internet was out that day and when I asked about it the response was \"It's working fine, you are probably not doing something right.\" Yup me and everyone else in the joint, back at our table I made a comment about the help and the person next to us agreed they also told me they have a constant problem with the internet in that store.

I had the chicken Caesar salad and it was good, but kind of lacking of chicken meat and Caesar dressing.  Most of the bakery products I've had at panera are excellent.    P.s.

My husband and I love that we can order online for a quick lunch/dinner, and we love that our infant's car seat fits perfectly in the booth for days we need to get out! My husbands job also requires him to bring breakfast/lunch to peoples offices so he is there VERY often for large orders. I would say 40% of the time this Panera messes up our orders, but we're not too picky and still eat what they give us... However, the reason I'm writing this review is because we went there tonight for dinner. Granted it was towards close so we knew we didn't have much time to eat. There were approximately 12 people still sitting eating their meals, when we heard the employees not 1 time....not 2 times....but 3 times how \"people need to leave so they can clean the tables\", \"people need to leave because I have somewhere to go\", \"do people not know we're closing in a couple of minutes?!?!?\"  We also watched the manager lock the front door and scream out to someone that they're closed. This lead my husband to get up and scream, \"can I please finish my meal in peace! Is that ok!?!?!\" The employee responded yes and didn't say another word. Just simply awful.",

    "text": "This is a decent Panera store, and I come here regularly because it is close to where I work.  I typically do rapid order pickup but on occasion go in to order, and typically the service is a bit slow, hence why I order ahead using their app. The staff are generally pleasant enough but yes, they could be friendlier, but I've never experienced anyone be rude to me.  I find the store and bathrooms to be neat and tidy and have never thought that the store was unclean, but again I rarely eat in, so maybe I'm not there long enough to witness this. The food is decent quality even if it is a bit expensive, but I'd choose Panera over fast food any day.  They offer a lot of healthier options than other quick take out places, and they do their best to use natural ingredients and provide nutritional information/calories for each of their items, so that makes eating their convenient and easy if you are tracking your daily intake.  Overall I think they are as good as any other Panera that I've been to, so I plan to keep going back.  Be sure to sign up for Panera's Rewards program - even if you only eat there once or twice a month, you typically can get freebies every couple of months.  Also try the Rapid Pickup order by using their app to place your order ahead of time - this is really convenient and makes getting in and out a breeze!",

It was the only option I had since I was limited to the plug on the wall. A guy at the table next to me even offered me a napkin so I didn't have to put my laptop on the gross table.  Across from me sat a man, asleep, hand in a bag of chips that weren't from Panera, and water bottle full of who knows what on his table. He would occasionally wake up, disturb the people all around him by yelling gibberish, eat a chip and fall asleep while chewing. He even got up, filled his water bottle with a fountain drink, shook it up and yelled \"pop\" across the restaurant as the top of his water bottle goes flying and pop comes spewing out.   What gets me is... the employee working came over and had a conversation with him. Never once asked him to leave or anything. Just a BS conversation.  Panera! Raise your standards! Your customers were annoyed by this dude and the fountain drink machine is... eww.

    "text": "I've been going to Panera for their salads pretty much since they opened and I've been to Panera's all over the country, however I had a unique experience last night which was the first time I've ever been to this Panera.  I ordered the Southwest Chile Lime Ranch Salad with Chicken except when I got it home I discovered it had no chicken.  There was romaine lettuce- lots of romaine, no arugula, no corn blend, no quinoa.  There was some tomato.  Not certain the cilantro was in there but there was quite a bit of feta-and no avocado.  It tasted good, but 3 ingredients-really?  At Panera?  Is this some kind of a joke?  I'm going to give them one more chance and eat the salad there rather than take out and if basically the majority of the salad is missing I'd like to know why and will ask for my money to be returned.  I would have given it 1 star but I liked the dressing and I was really hungry.   Buyer beware.",

    "text": "I've struggled a lot with the slowness of service and attitude of the workers here. Sometimes the line to make your order runs all the way to the entrance, and with only one register open it sometimes takes a really long time to place your order. Then, when you get to the register to place the order, the employee will give you attitude and impatience. However, I have been here several times and I know there are some friendly employees as well. While this Panera does leave a lot to be desired with the service, it does have some positive aspects that brings me back to this location. I personally love that it doesn't really ever fill up so I can bring my work here and get things done. Also, there are always spots with outlets available, which is definitely a plus.  Don't expect 5 star service when coming here and the food is pretty typical for any Panera, but this is a great place to come to get some work done or meet up with some friends to have a quick lunch.",

I go to the on on Centre Avenue in Bloomfield/Shadyside because it is directly across the street from the church that I attend.  Also I live a few blocks up the street from this location.  So for tonight's visit, five stars are not even enough to cover the beyond excellent service that I received from Eric   From all of my many visits through my many locations this visit was beyond exceptional!!!  The cashier Eric was so friendly professional, personable, kind, sweet etc.  I noticed that he gave all of the customers one on one, attention.  He treated everybody like he would his family or best friend.  I am a very very very picky eater.  There are only about ten foods that I like.  Eric made sure that my order was to my liking.  Thank you so much Eric.  Keep up the prossional and one on one friendly communications.  Eric definitely rocks!!!  Five stars plus!!!",

The steak and arugula sandwich is something I typically quite enjoy.  This version was thick with gloppy mayo (and not the usual horseradish tangy sauce) and had possibly 2 wilted leaves of arugula and zero of the pickled red onions.  And, then, to top things off, the area where customers are supposed to clear their plates was kinda gross.  The trash bin open and overflowing.  Tables weren't wiped down and the bathroom?  Eeewww.",

Ordered a Roast Beef Panini, yet received a Cuban Sandwich (which was pathetic looking even if I liked them). Called the store and spoke with the Manager Jennifer who said she would send the sandwich asap.  1:25pm rolls around and still no sandwich, my lunch break now long being over so I call and ask to speak to the manager. Jennifer answers and proceeds to tell me that they tried to deliver it but we didn't answer the phone when they called. I ask her for the number they dialed and she says ext 2882..... the ext is 2282. She tells us that it's our fault bc we provided her with the wrong info. I explain to her that they had the right # bc they called us the first time to say they were here the first time they delivered? So how did we give her the wrong number? Records show right number was provided and they screwed up.  I ask the Mgr to just refund the Sandwich, which she does..... unfortunately for me, it's been over 2hrs since we ordered and now I have no lunch and my break is over.  I would highly recommend steering clear of this location. Dine at your own peril.",

Overall the food is the same quality you would expect from other franchise locations but the service was inconsistent. There is also a small parking lot.   The first experience I had was terrible when it came to ordering. The cashier seemed untrained and there was only one other person in line but the employee seemed frustrated as though there were a major crowd. My order came out wrong and luckily the food prep staff quickly remade my food.   The second time my cashier was able to correctly and quickly take my order. And my food came out as expected. I'm a fan of the you pick two and the seasonal strawberry poppyseed salad is great this time of year.   The cleanliness of the tables both times wasn't the best despite a no more than half full restaurant. The location might need to spend a little more time cleaning off tables during peak hours. Overall I'll be back out of the convenience of this location only.",

Jayla - was phenomenal. She worked the order out to even save us a couple bucks!  (every penny counts!)  We worked it out that I would pick it up at 7:30am.  This morning - I went in to pick it up at 7:30a.  The catering coordinator came, I paid, and then she was great enough to help me carry the order to my car.  I made sure to tell her how much I appreciated Jayla.    I will go back to this panera - for personal and catering items.  I was in and out in under 5 minutes.  I know there will be times the wait will be longer - but that's ok.  Thank you for making my residents happy!",

And I can see why so many fellow Pittsburgh Yelpers really do not like this place.  I showed up here because I had some time to kill before I headed to work and I wasn't in the mood for fast food.  When I entered I was hit by a noise wall that was extremely loud.  So loud that when it came to ordering I was basically shouting my order to the employee behind the register.  After ordering I proceeded to the pick up area and just waited, I'd rather do that when I am dining alone.  Once the order was placed on the counter and my name was called I became disappointed.  When I was yelling my order to the register girl I had said that I wanted the pick two combo, half tomato mozzarella Panini and mac n cheese.  When I picked up my plate what I got was my Panini and half a ham and cheese.  o_O  Mac n cheese does not equal ham and cheese.  And I ended up with a piece of baguette even though I said I did not want it.  Who wants that much bread on one plate?  The only thing I got right in this order was the lemonade.  I didn't even argue because I know that I wouldn't have been heard anyway.  When I got to the table, or should I said crumb top table, I was disgusted.  I really didn't even want to eat my food.  I know you are busy, but have one of the twenty or so employees prepping food come out and wipe down the tables that are recently emptied.  In fact, I really didn't eat my food, I more like picked at it.  One bite of the Panini and I was done, especially when I came across a nut that I'm pretty sure didn't belong in there.  I attempted there sad interpretation of a bathroom and left feeling even more dirty that I had when I stepped in there.  If I want Panera, I'll head to a different location, never this one again.  It is obviously the worst in this city.",

I had to stop somewhere else to buy a couple of paper plates so it wouldn't look too bad at the meeting.
