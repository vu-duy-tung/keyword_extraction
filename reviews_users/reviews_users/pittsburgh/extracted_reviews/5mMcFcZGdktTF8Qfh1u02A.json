It had thinly sliced prime steak, done rare to medium rare, and served cold.  It was awesome.  And, truffle fries to boot!  Both the steak and the truffle oil set the flavor of this salad served over fresh mixed greens.  No head lettuce here!  I will definitely be back for this salad!  Oh, and the beer special was a $3 Miller Lite draft.  Aaah.",

    "text": "The only reason I'm giving it a 2 star instead of 1 is because the bartender was fabulous and we really enjoyed the guys from Sing Sing, but the rest explains why there was about 10 people in the whole bar.  With so few people there I have no idea why they have valet parking.  The food and table service where we sat to eat were terrible.  The waitress spilled water all over our beer menu while refilling and just left it, didn't bother to replace it even though we were still ordering.  It took well over an hour to get our food.  When the food came I said that's not the side salad I ordered, she just said nope it's the craft salad and walked away.  She came back to ask how the food was and never really gave us a chance to answer - my friends had flatbread and I had the chicken thighs.  All of it was burnt to a crisp.  Neither of my friends at even half of their flatbread.  She asked if we wanted boxes and when everyone said no she didn't even question if everything was ok with the food considering it wasn't touched.  Instead of asking if we needed anything else she just took the beer menu away and brought our checks.  When I pointed out I didn't eat my salad because it wasn't what I ordered and it wasn't good she actually argued with me about what I ordered and just said FINE I'll take care of it and walked away.  We moved to the bar where we had more drinks and thankfully finally had good service and entertainment.   I would return for the entertainment, but we would meet elsewhere to eat.",

The food is sufficient, nothing to write home about, but it's above average for \"bar food.\" However the bartenders don't seem to care too much. There has been numerous occasions where I sat for 15 plus minutes with an empty drink. I was even politely yelling for the bartender and was ignored, mind you the bar was really slow at this point and I was far from drunk, so if I was intentionally ignored I would like to know why. I do recommend giving this place a try though. It's a lot of fun regardless of the sub par bartending.",

They told us that they had a limited menu which seemed odd considering this was the grand opening. We all ordered hamburgers and asked that they be cooked well done and we also all ordered the fresh cut french fries. Once the food arrived, it was served on a metal lunch tray which was reminiscent of a prison tray. I assume they don't have plates. The presentation of the meal was terrible as everything was just thrown on the metal tray. As I looked at my burger, I noticed there was blood all over the bottom bun. I cut that part off and cut into my burger which wasn't anywhere near well done let alone anywhere near medium. The bun was also cold and must've just been taken out of a bag. My friend sent her meal back because her cheese burger was so pink inside. The waitress was courteous and brought out another cheese burger however this one was half the size of the original burger and was burnt like a charcoal brick. The cook also just threw two pieces of cold cheese on this burger. They at least melted the cheese on the original but this one was presented with two slices of cheese just thrown on top. As far as the \"fresh cut\" french fries go, they were simply frozen french fries that they just threw in a deep fryer. The burgers had no flavor and neither did the fries. The food was extremely plain and poorly made. Each burger was $13 and definitely not worth the price. I won't be going back to this place.",

And keep in mind this DJ is controlling the music before the band comes on as well as during the breaks- it's horrible!

More or less the same offering you get at every craft beer bar. But I have to put a special mention to our waitress Jessica last night. She took over for Maya who, one her second day, did a good job. She introduced Jessica to us when she was finished. We ordered a drink and told her we were there to see the band. In the 1+ hour that we sat at our table after the initial introduction, we saw Jessica ZERO TIMES!!!  She never asked how we were doing and if we needed anything to drink, which was obvious because of all the empty glasses around us. Finally we went to the bar to get served, and we had great service at the bar. After sitting at the bar for about 45 minutes someone tapped on my shoulder. It was Jessica handing me the bill for the one drink we had when she was supposed to be waiting on us. Never an apology for not checking on us. Nothing but \"Here's your tab.\"  We frequent crafthouse a lot. We'll be sure to steer away from Jessica in the future.",

    "text": "Crafthouse is the perfect example of when a business can't stick with one idea and seems to fail everywhere else.  Upon arriving I noticed the valet, which seemed very out of place. I really disliked this; not only is the idea of a valet silly in a place where parking is a breeze but it feels cheap.   The restaurant itself was very nice and new, unfortunately smelled like wet paint--not so appetizing. There was a live band the evening of my visit but the restaurant was just about half way full, perhaps they should section parts off? It just seemed sad to have a good band playing to a dead room.   I ordered the buffalo chicken salad; it was nothing more than chicken fingers on a bed of ice burg lettuce, not the bed of mixed greens as advertised. It wasn't awful but absolutely not worth the $14/15 it cost. Those I was with agreed that the food was bland and very overpriced.  Our service wasn't bad and the drinks were good but ultimately over priced and in need of better direction by management.",

They had folding chairs set up near the stage, and they were completely full or covered in coats and bags from people saving them for others. There were no tables or seats at the bar. I asked a waitress where we were supposed to sit and she said everything was first come, first serve. I'm not sure what having a ticket did for us. They had the couches \"reserved\" as others have posted. Cold Hard Cash was amazing, but we couldn't stay for the show because we were so uncomfortable from standing for 2 and a half hours. Not one waitress or bar tender offered us anything. We won't ever go back.",

The seared ahi tuna tacos are gone, replaced with Thai shrimp tacos with \"Asian mushroom slaw\", which sounded good but tasted like it was out of a can, watery and metallic-tasting.  The truffle fries are still on the menu, but the fries they have made them with have changed.  They used to be ultra-crispy, almost like they were breaded.  Now they are \"hand-cut\", which is harder to pull off.  The result was limp and greasy, albeit truffley and cheesy.  Also, the food took forever to arrive.  Still, my hubby's Creole pasta was tasty, and the beer selection was still top notch, so he was happy.  But the establishment's shiny first experience has certainly dimmed a bit.  What will our third visit hold for us?",

We got there early on a Friday night as they have a great happy hour special.  Select draft beers were 1/2 off  and they have a very nice selection. I went with a Vermont beer that was a pineapple shandy. It was a little flat so for my next beer I went with the McKenzie's Black Cherry cider which never disappoints.  Select appetizers (only about 4) were 1/2 off and we went with the boneless buffalo wings. They have many sauces to choose from and we stuck with the traditional buffalo sauce served with blue cheese. I was extremely impressed as the wings were not fried and great quality chicken.  I ordered the buffalo chicken flatbread as my entree=-it was a 1/2 price appetizer and to be honest not very good. There was too much cheese and the flatbread was very doughy.  I blame myself for ordering the wrong thing and I should have stuck with ordering a salad or burger.  My fiance got the chicken gyro wrap with fries. He was extremely happy with his choice and the fries are fresh cut and top notch.  Our waitress  was fantastic and I would go back and order something different next time.  A band was playing later that night but we got in before it got crowded and the cover charge started.",

I pushed the thought aside but guess where it was parked?  Directly behind my friend right up against the bumper sideways on that hill!

The staff is really nice and professional. No matter how busy they got the bartenders never ignored me and even took the time to let me try a couple of pours I'd never had before.

Same goes for parking, they do offer valet services but that's not my style, I like to park my own vehicle. Early is key if you're coming on the night of a fairly popular act. The food isn't bad but the choices are limited to only a few selections, prices are higher than they should be and service is slow because I think they are understaffed.

Our other two friends arrived at 6:57 and they charged them for some odd reason. I would have questioned it but they didn't seem to mind. The band did not start playing until 9 and it seems to get pretty crowded around 8. Our waitress was very nice and attentive even on a busy night. We ordered drinks and I asked for a mojito. My mojito tasted like pure water and mint. Luckily she was nice enough to take it off the tab and get me a different drink which was very well made the next time. I ordered the chicken wrap with aioli and truffle fries. I thought everything tasted amazing! Loved the food! Our whole table loved their food as well! The food did take a long time to come out though. Staff throughout the venue was very friendly. I can say some things on the menu and drinks can be pricy. They do have weekly happy hour and weekly specials so that is nice. We had fun gathering with friends and it's nice that they have decent musical guests come here often. We would probably come back when there are more specials going on to save a few bucks.",

When I received my bar bill at the end of the night I was in for a shocking unpleasant surprise. They charge me $7.50 for a pint of Guiness(U.S. Pint not Imperial) and $7 for a pint of Bluepoint Toasted Lager. If this restaurant was in downtown New York or Boston then I would expect those prices, but it's located on a back street in a middle class neighborhood, attached to a bowling alley about 15 miles south of downtown Pittsburgh. No where on the menu or beer list to they list the prices. Typical downtown Pittsburgh beer prices is $5 a pint. I also ordered food. I ordered a beef brisket sandwich and fries for $12. Thought the brisket was very tasty they skimped on the portion. One layer of brisket which did not make it to the edges of the bun, but the crispy onion rings did. So that's what you mostly taste. On a positive note ... I sat at the bar and the service was excellent. Plus .... It is an excellent place to see live music. The sound system was crystal clear and didn't blow out my eardrums. And the sightlines from any where in the bar is good. Overall ... Bar and Food 1 star Music Venue 4 stars",

I ordered the craft house shrimp salad $16.95 for some lettuce and 5 pieces of shrimp. BEST PART: on the bill it was $18.95. My bf ordered shrimp tacos $10.95, got chicken $9.95... no big deal until we see on the bill it's $11.95 plus $5.95 for a side salad. Basically there was an up charge of $2 on everything (even our drinks) which the manager said was because they didn't print updated menus for the event. We just let it go and told each other we will never be back. We dine out a lot and NEVER were the prices on the menu higher on the bill. Whatever is printed on the menu should be what you pay or you should be warned before you order that prices will be higher. This is extremely deceptive and absolute horrible business practice. I thought this place was cute and that I wanted to come back with friends but I will never come back after how we were treated by management. The server was good until we asked for the menu after we got our bill and she sent the manager over and then took forever to give us change, etc. Apparently it's offensive when you question why EVERYTHING you ordered was $2  more. I've never experienced anything like this before.",

    "text": "I came here for the Thursday night line dancing. I was visiting my parents from Southern California, where I go line dancing regularly, and was having a very difficult time finding anywhere in Pittsburgh that offered line dancing. After a difficult search, I found the Crafthouse. Given that this is the one of the only places in town that offers line dancing, I'm surprised that it isn't more heavily advertised.   Anyways, they offer lessons the first and third Thursday of the month. There is a DJ, but no live bands the 2 nights I went. They also play mostly line dances and very few partner/couple dances.  The Crafthouse is nice, but smaller than the country bars I'm used to. There are definitely regulars that know all the dances, and they were all very friendly! I will be returning when I come to visit my parents next time :)",

You have to upgrade your fries to the truffle parmesan fries.   The service was also great! The music and line dancing was... interesting but it is definitely a place to try out!",

Once inside, we found no one at the hostess station, but there was a group of people there for an event, I assume. They were dressed like wedding guests and were getting drinks from the bar.  We stood around for a few minutes and no one greeted us. So we left with a terrible first impression.",

Did not know about valet because I turned into the first parking lot on the site. Will probably go back eventually, but will Uber. Once bitten twice shy...",

    "text": "Just a confusing place. Nobody home to answer phones the day of a concert even an hour before doors open. It's a bar with happy hour (but not on the nights they have music), they also have bowling (not open on music nights either, possibly?). The whole operations is problematic if you don't know and you drive there. Further, they have an 'event' food menu which increases the already expensive food prices another 20%. $18 for a salad with chicken, $19 for a big pretzel? Its just stressful for concerts because you want to take a table (there's a small GA floor up front too), but then you get asked about food/drink all night. Much easier to go to just about any other venue for music I'd say. Oh and my beer was very rough. They told me it was the end of the keg and I suspect it's been the same keg for a WHILE. Also, it's disingenuous to not list beer prices on the menu only to find out they're inflated beyond the already high prices posted online.  As far as the sound, good god is it too loud. I bought high quality ear plugs because I go to lots of concerts, usually Metal. And I'd say even with them in it's too loud. It's just insulting to people in the crowd. People's hearing is important and I can't begin to understand what would motivate them to mix shows this way.  Sorry for being harsh, I love going to concerts and the whole logistical nightmare and price gouging is just a bit too much to swallow.",

I was third in line waiting at the door and only to find that band members had saved 12 seats in the front row. This is a terrible practice. Keep in mind I'm a paying customer who purchased tickets and has dropped $150 before the band has not even started.   Crafthouse please change your practices.",
