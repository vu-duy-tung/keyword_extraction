The chicken on the tostada was better than the jerk chicken but still tasted slightly off, probably due to the fact it was shredded chicken. The rest of the tapas we tried were okay but, as I said, not worth the price.",

    "text": "Pressed filet... I say that first just in case this review is too long and you do not read on, that is the must have sandwich. Our waitress said it was her favorite and she wasn't just overselling it was fantastic!! We also tried the brocolli rabe sandwich which was good, especially the bread but still couldn't compare to the pressed filet. The sandwiches won't disappoint, and neither will the desserts (be sure to ask for a dessert menu) both the cheesecake and the grilled banana bread and panna cotta were delicious, particularly the grilled banana bread, what a concept. The only thing that disappointed were the appetizers, we tried the tostada and the yakitori trio. The tostada simply wasn't very good but was shareable, unlike the yakitori trio which has three meat skewers that are hardly enough for one, but tasty. Overall, the place is midway on the price range, apps $7-$10, sandwiches $11-$13 and desserts $3-$7, you'll be tempted to try several items so if you have to skip something pass on the apps, because the service is plenty fast enough to wait, another plus. Absolutely worth a visit!",

I'd previously researched the restaurant and was interested in their street food concept. The atmosphere was unique with the Southside street signs posted around the restaurant. I ordered the Roast Pork Broccoli Rabe and my wife ordered the jerk chicken skewers. The roast pork was fantastic. It was perfectly seasoned along with the broccoli and it paired well with its crusty roll. My wife also enjoyed her jerk chicken along with her rice and peas. She agreed that it was quite comparable to authentic Jamaican food. We'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "Streets on Carson has an interesting and ambitious menu of small plates, sandwiches and desserts. Our table of five started with a varied selection of starters. Overall the prices are somewhat less than might be paid at a more formal restaurant. My top vote goes to the cheese plate with interesting accompaniments. The raspberries & blackberries were very sweet, the Pinot Grigio gel yummy, the candied walnuts welcome. The seeded crackers were perfect. While the honey was a good choice, the menu mentioned honeycomb and a small piece on the plate would have been nice. The bone marrow for $7 is a steal. The wings were fall-off-the-bone tender but a little heavy on the lime juie. Other dishes we had were the steamed buns, the rice balls (small plate of 3 which looks small but gave each of us a couple fork fills), and the pork egg roll. The pork with broccoli rabe sandwich was right on. The fries that accompanied were home made. My daughter enjoyed the Cuban. The only disappointment was the pastrami sandwich which was ordered by both of the gentlemen in our party. For $13, it was a far cry from a real deli sandwich. The soft rye was flavorless, and while the pastrami was smoky & tasty, it was a teeny layer of meat that didn't evencover the whole piece of bread. The mustard dressing was good. This one should be re- thought. We were so stuffed we couldn't indulge in dessert. If your Fido likes bones, be sure to ask for a container to take your marrow bone home. A nice touch was chilled waters placed on table in pretty wine and alcohol bottles, to serve yourself.  A good place to go if you have a group with varied tastes.",

I strongly recommend the confit wings...they fall right off the bone and then melt in your mouth. We also had the spring rolls, arancini, and lobster crepe. Seriously, everything was truly distinctive and delectable. Last but not least, I think the prices are fair for the quality of the food you get. I can't wait to get back here!",

When I came in, it was pretty early and there weren't very many people there. My girlfriend was late so I ordered a cocktail and made some conversation with the bartender. She was super cool and the drinks were good.When my friend came, we decided to just eat at the bar. We split several appetizers, all of which were pretty spot on! The pork belly steamed buns were my favorite but I also enjoyed the arancini. My one comment would be in regards to the poutine. I really enjoy cheese/gravy/potatoes and salt. You really have to be insane to not love those things (sorry my vegan friends but y'all are kooked) but there was just way too much salt on the fries and it was intense. Overall a great experience, I might not get the poutine when I go back but I will definitely go back.",

While most of the \"little guys\" are indeed little, such as the chicken samoas from India or the arancini from Sicily, the Duck Fat Fried Poutine from Quebec is anything but. It's large and rather addictive! Even though all of the sammies come with a side o' fries, there's reason to believe they aren't duck fat fried! And the Taiwanese steamed buns are also worth checking out. The only mains are sammies, but there is obviously quite a variety to choose from. The roast pork + broccoli rabe doesn't quite rival Philly's own DiNic's, but it's a valiant effort. Wash it all down from a decent list of local drafts and unique cocktails. The small, intimate (yet casual) space allows for friendly, attentive service. And there's plenty on the menu to give this place another go -- with this killer concept, the sky's the limit.",

    "text": "VERDICT: This spot beats out Smallman Galley, Whitfield, and Morcilla for best new restaurant in Pittsburgh.  FOOD: Inventive cocktails, and global bar food with a decidedly upscale French flair. We sampled the burger, the pork belly, the confit chicken wings, and the duck fat fried poutine. All excellent, both in quality of ingredients and in the attention paid to preparation. I've traveled through much of Canada, and this is still the best poutine I've had. We were too stuffed for dessert, but availed ourselves of the innovative \"kitchen coffee\" option, wherein the customers get to buy a round of beers for the kitchen staff - we were taken upstairs to deliver the glasses in person and briefly chat with the chef and staff to express our appreciation.  SERVICE: Despite being a Friday night in Southside, the service was on point. Our server, Sophia was delightfully enthusiastic, the manager, Lauren was gracious, and some of our food was personally delivered by the chef, Matt. Everyone seemed to be really committed to making this a success. Lauren was also kind enough to recover a lost item for us and hold on to it for a week until I made it back.   AMBIENCE: the decor is dominated by a graffiti-esque mural in the corner, and accented by other local artwork, giving it a streetlike feel. The newness of the space leaves it feeling a bit stark right now, but as time goes by, it'll develop a patina that will enhance the gritty urban feel they're going for.  BOTTOM LINE: Get to Streets on Carson asap before it becomes the next Meat and Potatoes and weekend reservations become well nigh impossible.",

I had the \"Turkey\" dish which was a piece of whitefish that was cooked to perfection. It wasn't the most interesting thing on the menu but I was on a special diet and needed something light/healthy and it fit the bill. My companion had the pulled pork sandwich which was the best tasting thing I've tried in awhile. The bread they used was phenomenal as was the other toppings and they also had really good, crispy french fries which is very rare.  Prices were spot on to the quality/portion of the food. It got a bit loud after the place started to fill up but seems like that is the norm of these one room establishments and there isn't much that can be done.

Even the rice and beans on the plate were done right. I often feel that chicken is dry and over cooked, more often than not. Not here, the sauce that it came with was a great addition. My friend had the filet tip sandwich. Tender, juicy steak. I even liked the fries, which rarely happens. Finally a restaurant in the southside I will look forward to going to.",

We popped in on a cold afternoon, so the joint wasn't too busy. The atmosphere is very modern and has a great Pittsburgh vibe with the tables sporting local street names. The staff was attentive and friendly and the beer and cocktail selections are impressive. My husband ordered a delicious stout, and I stuck with water due to my current 9 month commitment to sobriety.  The menu is fun, offering different small plates and sandwiches from different geographic regions. We settled on the poutine and the Korean BBQ bao buns. The buns...on point. The poutine, while very tasty, was a little too salty for us (we're salty enough). The sand which selections looked fantastic with a filet / cheese selection representing pittsburgh that I feel I definitely have to try. We'll be back!",

My group not late night, are party people ( but the place has but does  seem to have many fans, after work crowd!)  For a lunch or a Sunday brunch I would suggest you go & enjoy.  Food good, well prepared & good service. Bottom line: good service, food well done, prices are great. This place  a silly, super restaurant that celebrates and supports the Pittsburgh spirit.",

    "text": "When I found out that another French restaurant had opened in Pittsburgh, I was pretty excited. Cafe du Jour still ranks as one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh so I was indeed looking forward to the opportunity to see what this place had to offer. I came in and was immediately greeted enthusiastically by the owner of the restaurant. Telling her that it was my first time in, she immediately asked and made a number of recommendations to accommodate my preferences. This has played out every time I've come in to try something new. In general, the menu is subject to time to time depending on freshness of ingredients and what's available. I'm glad the place hasn't gotten rid of my favorite sandwich here, which is probably the Roast Pork Broccoli Rabe. There's something just so wonderful about the roast pork and how it's prepared here. Incredibly juicy, fresh, and full of flavor. Oh and did I mention that all the sandwiches here come with fresh fries that also taste great to boot? The Pressed Fillet is a great second option, but really you can't go wrong with any choice you make. They have a wide selection of appetizers and sandwiches to fit basically any taste and I also really like how they tailor menu items to different cuisines that people might like. In general, this has always been a great place to go eat. Great food, friendly and enthusiastic owners/staff, and at reasonable prices. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area!",

We sat at the bar and the bartender greeted us promptly with menus.   My friend got the pepito and I got the confit wings. The pepito's bread-to-meat ratio was way off, it was mostly just bread.  The duck fat poutine fries were sooo underwhelming. Probably the worst part of the meal. They were cold, soggy and all of the ingredients that made them \"poutine\" were at the bottom of the bowl. Definitely not worth the upcharge (that we weren't informed of). The wings had a decent flavor but were falling apart. I get the appeal there in theory (\"the meat was so tender it fell off the bone!\"), but I don't want a wing to fall apart when I take a bite.   Overall, an OK experience, but I probably wouldn't go back.",

On Sunday morning we were looking for a new brunch spot & chose Streets on Carson!   When we arrived there were only 2 other people eating at the bar who left shortly after we arrived. We were the only people in there for about 1 1/2 hours which was surprising to me. We were quickly greeted by our waitress who was super nice and attentive. The atmosphere inside is also super cool. They have graffiti on the walls and all of the tables are named after different South Side streets- super cute idea! I was getting ready for Sunday Funday- so started off with a mimosa and Chris ordered the spicy bloody mary. Both were great drinks!   My issue with brunch is I can never decide if I want the \"br\" or \"unch\" part of it. Lucky for me, Chris couldn't decide either so we chose to get both and split! Immediately, the Chiliquiles caught me eyes. The best way to describe this dish is breakfast nachos. It had homemade tortilla chips, scrambled eggs, chorizo, salsa, peppers & queso. It was delicious! We also split the All American Classic-merica burger. It had caramelized onions and bacon on it and was served with fries. This burger was pretty good but I have had better. After looking through Yelp reviews & pictures, I can't wait to come back for dinner and try their dinner options.",

Normally I don't really care about outstanding quality of service unless it is noticeably bad but this guy really did a great job, and it made the experience memorable in a fun way. He fit the atmosphere perfectly.   We decided to share a few of the small plates and a sandwich. We had the arancini, duck fat poutine and the jerk chicken. All three were honestly amazing. The yogurt sauce that came with the jerk chicken was to die for and the rice and beans were perfectly flavored and moist -- I hate dried out rice! The chicken itself was perfectly zesty and a tad bit charred. The arancini was awesome. Prosciutto was noticeable but no big chunks. I dipped every bite in the creamy sauce. So good. The poutine was also amazing. Crispy fries, flavorful gravy and cheese curd that was just melted enough. We cleaned the bowl.   For the sandwich we shared the pork and broccoli rabe. It was awesome. The flavor of the pork almost reminded me of wedding soup..in a delicious way. It was also a HUGE portion.   We ALMOST didn't get dessert but I am so glad we did. Our waiter recommended the cinnamon panna cotta and grilled banana bread. It was honestly one of the best desserts I've ever had in my life. I literally want to go back and get it again tonight. GET THIS DESSERT!!!  I will 100% be back.",

Our waitress was really great and the chef accommodated my nut allergy really well, often coming out to ask me if certain foods and items were ok for me. J and I split the cheese plate which was good. The honey was amazing! J had a coke and the all American burger, and I had a sprite with the pepita sandwich. Everything was really good!

The menu is fairly eclectic and focused on mostly small plates, fresh soup (new type daily), and sandwiches that serve as entrees. I ordered two small plates - pork spring rolls (think shredded pork, aioli, and vegetables) and jerk chicken skewers with coconut rice. The spring rolls were excellent and very big. Honestly it's way more filling than one would expect. The jerk chicken was surprisingly good as well. Good level of spice (about a 3 on a scale of 5), very tender, however less filling than the spring rolls. The coconut rice was less impressive. It was mushy and didn't really stand out. Then again, I'm not much of a coconut rice fan anyway. I would definitely return. I imagine the ambiance, particularly during a happy hour or weekend night is probably pretty cool.",

You could go to one of the stereotypical, yuppie establishments and pay $10 for buffalo chicken dip or $14 for a burrito or you could come here and pay that, if not less, for delicious and unique food!  When I came here my boyfriend got the special (a Cuban) and it was so flavorful. I ordered the Tapioca, inspired by the Laranieiras Market in Rio de Janeiro. It's basically like a taco but not with mexican flavor profile at all. You can pick what's in it. But that's the best way to describe the way it is served. The shell is made of tapioca flour so it's soft and slightly chewy. A very unique and welcome textural food experience. I ordered the one filled with duck confit, caramelized leeks, caramelized shallots, roasted garlic, smoked Gouda and drizzled with balsamic glaze. Wow. It was great.   We also split the bone marrow. I have only ever had it once in a very fancy restaurant. This tasted almost exactly the same and was only $7!!!!! and we paid an extra $1 for more toast. But honestly, it was so good we couldn't believe we only spent $8.   And the drinks and cocktails are on par as well.   All around a very, very, very welcome place for the Southside. I recommend it to everyone, especially those who are more adventurous eaters looking for something unique and fun that won't hurt your wallet.   We also found out that the restaurant is owned by a young couple who had this great idea for a food-truck concept that turned into an actual restaurant thanks to the opportunity of this location. Knowing it's a local, family-owned restaurant makes it all the better.   Take a break from the places in Southside all owned by the same group and give this place a shot. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Streets on Carson is such a cute concept. The space is amazing, and it's filled with a ton of graffiti like art, depicting South Side.  I'm a fan of the menu (especially the Brick Chicken Chlebicek, which is an open faced chicken sandwich with liver mousse on top), and I think that the concept of foods around the world is really amazing and a good way for people to try food without actually having to leave the zipcode.  The staff is always super friendly, and the drinks are always super strong. The wait can be a bit long, so make sure to call ahead for reservations!",

    "text": "Been here two times in the past two weeks and I'm already wondering when I can go back. Both times I had the same thing because they were so good the first time I couldn't part from them. I started with the lobster crepe (split with a friend). The texture of the crepe is not traditional french, but it's quite soft and almost has a sweet taste to it that lets the lobster stuffing melt in your mouth along with the crepe itself. The sauce they put on it.... I would be interested if the chef would allow me to buy it by the gallon... amazing. I then had the veggie version of the Philadelphia cheesesteak... I actually had to have my friend try it because I didn't believe it wasn't real meat. So delicious and juicy. As a vegetarian for almost 10 years I have tried my fair share of \"faux meat\" attempts in upscale restaurants. This is the best I've had. Drink prices are a little high for carson street but the cocktails are unique and DELICIOUS! Happy hour prices are great too. Do not miss dessert no matter how full you are. I hope I get the wherewithal to try a few more menu items next time I go back but I don't think i can part with my faves. Not to forget - excellent atmosphere and impeccable/consistent service both times. Can't get better.",

    "text": "One of the unique attributes of Streets is that they list the location (read: street) that inspired a particular menu item. Perhaps vague in some cases, the street that resonated with me was North 12 Street in Philadelphia. For those unfamiliar with Philly, North 12th is the street that historic Reading Terminal Station is located. In this amazing urban market you'll find a dynamite roast pork sandwich, among many other things, so I had to try Streets' rendition for comparative purposes and was very impressed!  The sandwich was well seasoned, the pork was tender and juicy and the rabe was cooked perfectly (not too bitter). The fries were also delicious. My wife had the brick chicken sandwich which was also a great choice.  The service here were excellent as well, with the bartender taking the award for most conscientious and affable I'd encountered in a long while. I would definitely recommend this place, especially during happy hour where the value for the quality is tough to beat.",

    "text": "We stopped in today because I heard they had a good happy hour. To be honest I found the HH disappointing (for south side standards) . it seems that their entire HH policy and pricing changed just within the last month. The review of the great HH brought me in, & we left disappointed.  They have a happy hour drink menu which included a few signature drinks (maybe 5-6) that were $6. Our server informed us that they had no HH specials on food. While the menu had some interesting things, I was disappointed no specials were offered.... Mostly because recent reviews state both a  HH food menu & $5  cocktail list.  We ended up ordering two drinks (a drink each). Bobby ordered the Communist which was gin, orange juice & cherry brandy. The drink was actually delicious, although too sweet for him. I ordered another drink.. Can't remember the name. It had gin, vermouth & something else. Both drinks were strong, but very small. We left after one drink to find somewhere to eat.   In all honesty there are much better happy hours in the burgh and especially in south side. I intend on coming back to try the menu, but not for happy hour. Our server was nice. Kinda felt bad leaving after one drink.",

A combination of great service, beautiful restaurant, casual atmosphere, unique affordable menu = winner winner.   Love the concept: street food around the world, most you have never heard of, but they will be more than patient with all your inevitable questions lol. Although the dishes may seem small, they are deceptively filling. A combination of any 2 choices will satisfy even the hungriest of stomachs. Always great to see a menu with multiple items under $10  Talk about cool decor; The interior is modern meets urban, with hanging street lights and graffiti to drive home the point!   On to the food, for lunch I had   1) duck confit tapioca from Rio de Janeiro (leeks, shallots, Gouda, balsamic glaze)  2) pork spring rolls from Shanghai (cabbage, carrot, scallions, cilantro, sriracha aioli) 3)side of fries  Honestly it was alllll good, and way more than I should have ordered. This is not your America hot dog stand we're talking here, as these are some complex dishes executed very well.   Note to owner/manager: don't make too many changes! You have a great concept here.",

The owner showed me the artist motif around the restaurant which is very catchy. Even the tables have the names of various streets on them.  My waitress came and reviewed the menu with me. She told me that most of the dishes are small plates but if I wanted more then order a sandwich. I settled with the brick chicken  chlebicek (aka open faced) sandwich. It comes with fries coated with cheese.  I had to wait about 15 minutes for my meal but my waitress was attentive and made sure I had enough to drink during that time. The chicken comes with the skin on It is topped with a chicken liver mousse spread along with pickled onion and radish. It is served on a thick baguette. The chicken was mouthwatering good. Only difficulty I had was cutting it through the whole piece. Would have been easier with a sharp knife but my waitress suggested I just eat it by hand which I did.  The fries were good too and with the cheese added on top, absolutely filling. She then showed me a dessert menu but I was way too stuffed to try any of it. Will save that for next visit. I learned they had just opened after St Patrick's day so they are relatively new to the area. Prices are reasonable too for a descent size lunch.  Just remember that good things come to those who wait. So be patient. Good food coming your way!",

The food selection was fantastic - a great representation of global street cuisine. We had several things that we shared. The lobster crepe with sherry cream sauce was my favorite. It melted in my mouth & the flavor was out of this world. Huarache was good. Didn't know it would come on something similar to flatbread. The barbacoa on it was very good. My husband loved his slow roasted pork sandwich with broccoli rabe. He said it was one of the best pork sandwiches he's had and he's obsessed with pork. My mom had the Murica filet mignon burger & loved it. Next time I'd try the duck fat poutine. Will definitely return and highly recommend it.",

The restaurant and bar were fairly deserted, but this may just be because they are new.  I am completely a cocktail girl so I was so happy to see a nice list of $5 cocktails to choose from during Happy Hour!  Quite a few of the options looked good, but I settled on something grapefruit... I think it was vodka.  I am not always great at remembering what I order over a week later by name, but I really enjoyed the drink.  It was refreshing and perfect for a warm day.  Laura and I went halfsies on the HH small plates menu, and items were $4 or $5 from this menu.  We decided on the arancini balls and the poutine to share.  I love arancini more than most things, and this was one of my favorite versions.  The balls were quite large, and the small plate came with three.  There was a great amount of cheese inside, and the dipping sauce was perfectly delectable.  The poutine was decent but not something I would order again.  The portion was large, but it was super salty and the fries were a bit inconsistent in being overcooked or mushy.  I liked the vibe of this place, as it was casual and modern but still interesting.  This will quickly become one of the top Happy Hours so get here soon before the secret is out.",

    "text": "I visited Streets on Carson last Fri. at 6pm for HH with fellow Yelper Amanda J.  I arrived first and grabbed a seat at the bar, and I was immediately greeted by the friendly bartender, Alec, with a handshake.  He provided me with a HH drink and food menu and told me to let him know if I had any questions.  Always a sucker for cocktails, my eyes immediately gravitated to the infused spirits on the HH menu ($5 each).  Per the recommendation of the woman sitting next to me, I decided to try the tarragon rum.  It wasn't overly sweet, and the flavor of tarragon was quite distinct but not overwhelming.  Though it packed a punch, it went down *real smooth.*  Next, I ordered the lemon gin.  I wasn't as much of a fan of this one.  To my surprise, it had a deep pink color, and the lemon flavor wasn't as distinct as I expected--even with my eyes closed, I'm not sure that I could have readily identified it as lemon.  For food, we ordered from the HH small plates menu, which contains miniature versions of several of their regular menu items ($4-$5 each).  We ordered the arancini balls and the poutine to share.  Though this was my first time trying arancini, I can call myself a fan.  They had a creamy interior and a crisp exterior, and the sauce accompanying them complemented them nicely.  The poutine impressed me less, though it wasn't bad.  Like many poutines, I found it on the salty side, but the flavor and consistency of the gravy was nice.  The cheese curds weren't as plentiful or large as those of some other poutines I've tried around town, but the heat of the gravy caused them to partially melt, creating the stringiness characteristic of a good poutine.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the decor of Streets is quite artistic and interesting, evoking a playful urban vibe.  In particular, I was a fan of the traffic lights in the front windows, and I thought the idea of naming the tables after PGH streets was creative and interesting.  I also really like the thematic concept of Streets, which is to serve street food from around the world.  Their HH was a great value, and I enjoyed the food and drinks, so I'd definitely return.",

    "text": "I always want to tread delicately with reviews that are lower in the star rating. My intent is that hopefully the business will just get better and better, and I hope the same for Streets on Carson. Especially considering my fellow Elites had such stellar experiences.  The vibe is super cool, with graffiti art and street signs all around. It almost made me sad I wasn't enjoying a cocktail at the bar... but a lunch meeting called for just iced tea. The servers were both incredibly nice and explained the menu to us. Apparently most of the items are intended as small plates, but there are sandwiches in the mix.   I thought the menu was a little hard to read. I get that they're listing where things are locally sourced, but I think having a breakdown between categories like starters/small plates, sandwiches, larger dishes would have been helpful. Sandwiches were lumped in between small and larger plates and my eyes were darting all over the place trying to figure out what to order.   I ordered the Balik Ekmek, which was grilled white fish, salata, fresh lemon juice, on a roll, served with fresh cut fries. The fries seemed fresh cut and were good. The sandwich however was bland. There were no sauces on the sandwich, but it wouldn't have been needed if the fish was seasoned more.  Plus, it was toped by a non-ripe tomato and shredded lettuce. The roll was really good and might have been some sort of croissant type? It was a bummer the sandwich didn't turn out better.   I'd totally be down to check out the bar side and cocktails for another go-round. Maybe even a snack, but I'd definitely try something different next time.",

I read Rachel C's review and I totally agree with her about the menu. The concept of it is neat (dishes from all around the world), however you don't know what are snacks and what are large plates. I was very hungry, so I wanted to make sure I got something with some substance. I chose the special of the day (forgive me, I forget the name of it), but it was a sandwich stuffed with ahi tuna, pickled carrots and radishes, cucumber, jalepenos, cilantro, and some kind of sauce. It came with fresh cut fries. The portion was good, I left feeling full. I would come back to this place again to try out the drinks and small plates next time. For only being open for 4 months, I think Streets on Carson is on the right track!",

I ordered the roasted pork sandwich with broccoli rabe. It came with a side of fries. There was so much meat that it was falling off the sandwich. I was only going to eat half but it was too good to save for later. The pork had been cooked slowly and with lots of seasonings. It was tender and moist. The bead was fluffy but held its own with the pork. The sharp provolone was a perfect match to this sandwich.  My husband ordered the grilled fish sandwich. The bread was too much for the fish so my husband put the bun to the side and just ate the fish. The fish was tender and flaky. It had a nice grilled flavor.  We definitely want to go back and try more dishes. This really is a place you want to check out.",

I understand they may have prespecified quantities but for a tapas restaurant it is not nice to serve quantities that are not divisible by the number of guests. Dessert is not their forte. Probably the best tapa we tried was the lobster crepe",

While most of the items served are still somewhat bar food to an extent, having different cultural influences does give it a lot of variety that you can't find anywhere else. While I wouldn't call everything on the menu \"street food\" (particularly the two that we got, as they were huge), one can see that they are carefully designed and made. I am guessing that the prices inform the portion that you would expect to get.  For the roast pork, it came with a ton of seasoned meat on a flavorful and cheesy roll, with several pieces of perfectly grilled broccoli rabe. What was surprising was how well seasoned everything was, particularly with the herbs and spices embedded into the pork. and bread. Same story with the brick chicken, in which the chicken breast meat was actually quite tender, with a very flavorful layer of liver smeared on the roll underneath. The fries for both were also really well seasoned with herbs and topped with cheese pieces.   Environment is nice and casual with background music but not too loud. There's a bar area but it's definitely meant as more of a bar/restaurant hybrid. The wait for the food was a bit long but totally worth it.",

    "text": "Can I give a restaurant more than 5 stars?  Because Streets on Carson deserves it the world over.  I had heard stellar things about this place for entirely too long, so the SO and I decided to give it a shot one evening.  The space is super cool: decorated with grafitti and each table bears the name of one of the Southside's renowned streets. We just so happened to randomly sit at the Carey Way table, which is where I lived for nearly 7 years!  Once I got over the Carey Way nostalgia, we decided to peruse the menu.  We settled on (and shared) the following:  Sgagliozze (fried polenta sticks, Italy) - 5/5 - These were outstanding. I plan to wear stretchy pants next time so I can consume more than one order without batting an eye.    Aloo Tikki (potato pancakes, Pakistan) - 2.5/5 - These arrived at our table lukewarm at best, but the flavor profile was still solid. I was too hungry to worry about sending them back to be reheated.  Not sure if I'd personally order them again, but they did pique my interest and make me wonder what other tasty Pakistani treats I'm missing out on.  Dakgangjeong (Korean popcorn chicken, South Korea) - 10/5 - Imagine if someone captured heaven, fried it to a perfect golden brown, and stuffed it inside a takeout container.  These were so good that we had an intense discussion over who should get the last piece. I absolutely would order two of these and call it a meal.  So freaking good.  Ahi Tuna Bahn Mi (Vietnam) - 4/5 - I love seared ahi tuna and had never had a bahn mi, so this seemed like an obvious choice.  I was left wanting more tuna or veggies to balance out the bun, but overall this was a solid choice and exactly what I hoped it would taste like.  I really loved our dining experience here, and this has become my go-to recommendation when someone's looking for \"something different.\"  I really enjoyed being able to sample a bunch of different dishes from all over the world in one place!  Our service was excellent too, which only rounded out an already superb experience.",

Mozzarella Tapioca have disappointed me (considering I'm from Brazil, this is not authentic from my point of view. Too much balsamic vinegar and pesto. Maybe it's a different type that I have never tried before.) Anyway I don't recommend it, especially if you know the real Brazilian tapioca.  There's only one restroom for women and not neutral gender restroom. Somebody was taking forever to get outside and I was almost pee on my pants - lol!!!",

I ordered the top three most popular dishes, the pulled pork sandwich, egg rolls, and chicken jerk skewered. The Pulled pork was great but not amazing, and just as an FYI they use the same meat on both the pulled pork and the egg rolls. The egg rolls packed a powerful punch with a lot of flavors in combinations with the sauce that comes with. The Chicken skewer was bland and lacked flavor, however the coconut rice and bean was decent.  Overall this place is just OK but not worth the rave others make it out to be.

I was not drunk when eating here. I'd imagine that the food would taste better if I was intoxicated--like many other establishments in the Southside. The presentation of all the foods here were nice I'd say, above average.   From best to worse tasting out of everything I ordered, I would rank the dishes: steamed buns, egg rolls, chicken wings, jerk chicken and the Aloo Tikki.   The steamed buns were tasty but, nothing out of the ordinary. The pork belly was very fatty but cooked decently.   The egg rolls were full of life. There was so much going on with it and the sauce that drizzled the rolls really made the dish. The dough that surrounded the egg rolls were buttery and flaky.   The chicken wings also tasted average however, the meat fell of the bones which really impressed me. I never had chicken wings that were cooked so perfectly before.   The jerk chicken was ok. I was expecting a little sweetness from the advertised coconut rice however, I did not taste coconut at all.  The chicken was also bland.   The Aloo Tikki had a lot of flavor. It had a mashed potato consistency. For some reason though, it was just really boring to eat. I wish there was  more sauce or some other component to go with it.",

We were impressed with everything, and we'll have to make the restaurant a regular visit since they change the menu and they have so many incredible dishes to offer!",

I was dreadfully going to be on the South Side, and wanted to make the most of it. Streets on Carson made sure my evening was just that. Me and a friend ended up trying almost everything on the menu. Ok, that's a slight exaggeration, but we did get four apps (Bone Marrow, Polenta, Morrocan meatballs and soft bun pork) all of which was phenomenal. She got Turkey Devonshire and I got the Ahi Tuna. By the time we got those, we were not longer hungry, but I did take a few bites and loved it, boxing up the rest to go home.  I hate doing the South Side, but I will venture down there again for this place. It was absolutely the best.  Next visit we plan on getting the other apps we didn't try.  The service was spot on, the atmosphere was awesome and I don't know who trained the server, but his timing on food was impeccable.  Hightly reccomment.",

    "text": "Elevated Street Food from around the world is the idea, and Streets surely delivers on that premise. Nestled in the middle of East Carson Street's 1100 block, this spot is easy to miss with a modest sign and so many other things nearby to grab your attention. But I suggest you give Streets a try. Urban wall art is likely the first thing you'll notice stepping into the joint. Tables adorned with local street signs is probably the second. A rotating menu with light fare, cocktails, and sandwiches is hopefully the third. I was instantly set on ordering Arancini when I looked at the menu. This Italian concoction of rice and cheese isn't offered very many places in Pittsburgh, which is a shame... It's DELICIOUS. We ordered Sgagliozzi (Polenta Sticks) to share, which came with a Gruyere Dipping sauce that my boyfriend shamelessly drank once we'd finished off the sticks. Friends ordered Confit Chicken Wings and Steamed Buns, which we all shared. The Buns weren't the BEST I've had, but they were tasty. The wings were stellar. The cocktails all were pun-ny names, and decent tasting (not the best in the city, but not a waste of money since they were fairly strong). I think I'll stick to the beer menu next time. All in all, the concept is unique, unlike anything else in the city. Next time you want tk sample a variety of cuisines, head to Streets.",

(fun fact, they name all the tables after Southside streets... how fun is that?)  There is a great selection of wine and local beers, with happy hour options. The menu is diverse and I've enjoyed everything I've tried. The main dish that will keep me coming back: arancini balls. They are so tasty and the sauce is delicious. The order can be shared, but why bother... order two for the table and have your own!",

The service was fast and friendly. The burger I ordered was huge so I cut it in half to take it home unfortunately I forgot my to go box when we made a pit stop at jacks and because the burger was so good I'm still sad about forgetting it at jacks but I'll just have to come back soon and try some more amazing food.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I visited Streets on Carson for dinner on a Saturday night. The restaurant wasn't very crowded, but the atmosphere was still pretty loud. The menu consists of sandwiches and small plates that originate from all over the world.  We ordered a few small plates to share, and it was fun to pick from vastly different cuisines. We went with the artisan cheese plate, duck fat fried poutine, jerk chicken with rice and peas, and arancini. Each dish was tasty and well prepared. Our favorite out of the four was the arancini. While only three were provided on the dish, they were delicious and served atop a nice blush sauce. The jerk chicken was also excellent, and the accompanying green goddess sauce was awesome. The prices and portions seemed fair for the most part, and we definitely had enough to eat, however the cheese plate was not only fairly small, but also the most expensive of the four dishes.  Overall though, the food was great and decently priced. The service was fast and friendly, and our waitress was very accommodating to food allergies. I would definitely return.",

    "text": "Based on all the great reviews, I've been wanting to try out this place for quite some time now. I finally stopped in on a Thursday night and I'm sad to say I was extremely disappointed with both my food and my service. Maybe I came here on an off night?  My first impression was that the place looked really cool. Each table is given a South Side street name, hence the \"Streets on Carson\" and they have a decent selection of beers and cocktails. The food menu also looked really awesome with dishes from \"all around the world\" such as muffuletta sandwich from New Orleans or ahi tuna banh mi from Vietnam. I think the concept is great.   However, execution was lacking the night of my visit. I ordered the shrimp po boy while my friends ordered pastor tacos and a Cuban sandwich. Of the three meals, only one was decent, which was the Cuban. My shrimp po boy was served on thick, cold, Italian bread. It was drenched in their remoulade and get this, my shrimp wasn't even cooked all the way. Really, it was like eating a mayo sandwich with cold chewy shrimp. Really appetizing, right? My friend's pastor tacos lacked flavor where even a sprinkling of salt didn't help.   Service also wasn't that great. Our waitress never once smiled at anyone and just altogether looked and acted miserable. We just didn't feel very welcomed here.   I don't think I will ever come back and if I do, I will just stick to drinks.",

We could have kept popping those in our mouths all day! I ordered a drink (forget the name - something with an L) made with tequila. I could have drank 10, so good. As our meals, we ordered the Pan con Chicharron (so tastey and served on such a soft roll) and the duck conflict tapioca (like nothing I've ever had before and I want to eat it again and again!).

Their sandwich choices are ethnically  diverse, great experiences.  Last time I was there with my wife and two sons, I ordered the Beef on Weck, a roast top round beef sandwich that was absolutely sublime. One son got the Cuban sandwich, which he loved. I've had it in the past, and it was very authentic. My other son ordered the papas rellenas, which is a Cuban version of mashed potatoes stuffed with ground beef and spices and then deep-fried. He loved it!. We shared the duck fat French fries, and we all loved them. My first time, I had the roast pork sandwich topped with broccoli rabe and provolone, and that might be my favorite!

They had these confit chicken wings that I was super excited about but ended up being citrus flavored which was disappointing; had a sandwich that was ok, and something else not especially remarkable that I can't remember. Atmosphere was meh... there were a lot of bikers in the area flexing their motorcycles and periodically stopping in and being almost as loud with their yelling and obnoxious jokes. So, all in all not a good experience and probably won't go back.",

We ate a delicious Tapioca dish (not the pudding) that contained confit duck along with other delicious things and a Seitan Cheesesteake with hand-cut fries. Matt gave us vegetarian Arancini and these were delicious also. We went there because of the sincerity and passion of Matt and also the Yelp reviews. It was a delicious experience at the end of Carson Street, where the good stuff lives. We will return soon. A really good neighborhood place for adults on the South Side!",

    "text": "This is an interesting and welcome addition to South Side's restaurants. It's small and casual and serves up some amazing food all around the concept of offering various street food from around the world. The best and most delicious surprise were the chicken confit wings, which were the best I've ever had. They're not Buffalo wings and they're not messy. They are big and tender, with the meat practically falling off the bone and a delicious taste that still has me craving them days later. The small plates all sound so good that we opted to share several rather than fill up on a sandwich and fries. The sandwiches sounded great as well and I'll surely be back to try some out -- as well as more small plates. I do wish that the sandwiches didn't come with fries so that more small plates could be devoured instead. We also tried the chicken samosas (delicious with their dill sauce), the lobster crepe (succulent!) and the tostada with lime chicken and avocados (the least impressive dish that we tried, but delicious nonetheless). Another standout starter was the artisan cheese, which paired three interesting cheeses that were all quite different from one another along with some other goodies including unique pinot grigio gellee cubes. The service is attentive yet appropriately casual. The decor and furnishings are somewhat minimalist yet comfortable. There is a table in each of two windows facing Carson Street, a bar on one side and tables on the other. In a bit of whimsy given the name and concept of the restaurant, the side of each table bears a street sign with the name of one of the neighborhood's streets, which have their own awesome backstory. My only gripe is that the wine and beer list could stand to be a bit more robust. I can understand keeping the wine options down with open bottles (for by-the-glass), but given the worldly nature of the food, more bottled beer options would be in order.",

The menu offers street food from all over the globe (yes it took me 2 trips here to figure out what the streets theme was referring to.) You can go with either small plates or sandwiches, which r huge and come with fries. This time my husband and I split the bolinho, the chorizo tapioca, and the pork and broccoli rabe sandwich. The bolinho were little fried dough balls stuffed with black beans, pork and veggies and spices. I thought they had a great flavor - very smoky. The tapioca is a lot like a quesadilla but made with tapioca instead of tortilla. Also very good with the chorizo.    Finally the sandwich was pretty fabulous, the pork was super tender and very well seasoned. It was also H U G E and the fries were delicious - they come with fresh herbs and cheese. We went on a Tuesday so it wasn't very crowded. The service was great, our server was very attentive and responsive. This place is really fun and I'm excited it's opened up on Carson.",
