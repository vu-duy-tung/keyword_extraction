If you're an authentic BBQ fan you have to try this place. They also have a place in Murrysville.",

Unlike the routes to almost every other destination in Pittsburgh, the highways/roads to PBC involve no dead end streets, detours, construction zones or unnamed gravel paths. I guess that helped start off the trip out to PBC on the right foot. The food took care of the next part all on its own. Hands down, best BBQ I've had, and I have had some of the best in Tennessee, Texas, and Kansas City. YEE HAAAW BITCHEZ!!",

You will be sorry if you do because they're absolutely wonderful, made with like 8 different kinds of beans in a sweet/spicy sauce. Chicken is good and competent but it's not exceptional, and one time I ordered a half chicken but instead they gave me two breast sections which some people might enjoy but I'm a dark meat fan and I felt cheated. Ok the location is lousy and sometimes when I go there I end up on the wrong road. It's not a restaurant, it's a shack and you will most likely want to take the food home and heat it up. If you're cool with all that, you can't go wrong.",

I had always driven up and down Banksville Road and had been intrigued by the wonderful BBQ aroma wafting from the smaller cabin looking building.  I finally made the trip there to pick up some dinner and was not disappointed.  I had to try a lot once I made it in there and went with the pulled pork, tried a couple different flavors of ribs, the mac n' cheese, and the baked beans.  They each may have been the best I've ever had.  The pulled pork had an amazing vinegar sauce that made my night and the meat from the ribs just fell off the bone while it was difficult to decide which flavor I liked more.  The mac n' cheese was so good that my girlfriend stole half of mine after having her own serving. The baked beans with multiple types of beans, caramelized onions, and bacon was a great addition.  On top of that we received great service from a friendly guy named John who treated us like regulars and was extremely helpful.  I'll definitely be heading back again soon, I can't wait to try the brisket and maybe a baked apple knowing how good everything else already is.",

It's tricky to get to if you don't know what you're doing, so make sure you know how ot get there before you go!  But once you're there, these guys will treat you like their favorite neighbor.  They even gave me a bite of brisket for my dogs waitingin the car!  Stop in, bring a big appetite, and enjoy the food and the guys behind the counter!",

The location on Banksville Road is a tiny little shack behind the Days Inn (There are other locations that are more restaurant like) and is carry-out only, unless you feel like a picnic table in the summer.  I always get the beef brisket. It has just the right amount of lean meat and spice. I can't handle spice very easy, and though this isn't exactly mild (not hot but won't disappoint the bbq faithful for being weak) I suffer through because it is just. so. good.  And the cornbread! I could write a sonnet on the cornbread! I am not picky about my conbread. I will make the just add water and oil box variety at home-slap some butter on it and I'm pretty pleased. But this cornbread! So moist ( a word I've only utilized to describe a really good brownie) but not leaden and it has actual corn kernels in it. Yumm!",

Don't worry about me though, I get my fix from Morningstar Farms Ribletts. Sorry ....that's another review.  The Pittsburgh BBQ company is hidden behind Banksville Rd, you can smell it before seeing it. And that smell is amazing, more amazing as you get closer.    I used to order the brisket sandwich, it was tender, juicy, and loaded with smoky flavor from slow and low smoking. The slaw and beans rounded out this dish that no steak can ever wish to top. The chicken was good too, as are the ribs. But to me BBQ means brisket.  I still get the beans though, pretty damn good and they really fill that void for BBQ!  Hurry this place will be shutting down for the winter, usually they shut the doors for the winter in November and reopen in the spring.",

Guests raved about the brisket, but I was most impressed with the pulled pork - excellent eastern North Carolina style vinegar sauce! The bottles of hot sauce they provided were also very very good (on everything).   Art took care of organizing everything for us and he was great to work with. He prefers phone to email but once I figured that out he was very responsive and he got all the details right.   The women who came out do set up / clean up were also very good.

Since it was closed for winter months, I had to wait until March to stop by...and then kept putting it off for awhile simply because of the location-I take a different way home than I take in the morning to get to work.  Well let me tell you...I should have stopped on opening day. This place is great! It's hidden off from Banksville Road and you see always see the steady stream of smoke coming from the fresh barbeque. It's just a little place...with grills outside and just an ordering counter inside. (there is also a sign on the menu...encouraging you to Yelp about your experience!)  We ordered pulled pork and mac n cheese. I'll start with the mac n cheese...it was not good. I'm sorry...I am digging this place, but the mac n cheese had so little cheese on it that it looked and kind of tasted like buttered macaroni. It was cooked all day in a giant soup pot-sort of like you see in a cafeteria or in Giant Eagle in the prepared foods section. I'm wondering if perhaps the cheese almost cooks off when it's been sitting there all day...whatever the case, pass on the mac.  The pulled pork was a TOTALLY different story. It was succulent and juicy. Full of flavor. And it came with a side of the great house bbq sauce. Seriously delicious. It tasted like summertime.   The other meats looked great too...the chicken looked and smelled so yummy, and I can't wait to try the ribs and the brisket. The sides simply don't fit my taste...I could so go for some grilled corn on the cob...or a fire roasted corn dish of some sort. mm mm mm. For now, I'll stick to ordering the meat there and preparing some easy sides at home.  Due to the nature of the business this place is seasonal...don't put it off...go today!",

And while Pittsburgh doesn't rank on that scale yet, if the meat coma I got from the ribs at Pittsburgh Barbecue Company is any indication then they are definitely on their way.\r \r And even though the ribs are flavorful and juicy enough, thanks to an incredible rub, that they don't even need sauce on them you should still get the sauce because its vinegary/peppery taste has enough spice to enhance the meat, but not overpower it.",

    "text": "I have been here a couple of times, most recently a couple of Sundays ago with my fiance for dinner.  Getting to their location isn't too terrible but the problem is that it is difficult to see from Banksville road.  The inside of the shop is nice and clean and you can see all the meats that they have in a giant display case.  If you happen to order some ribs or brisket they cut it right then and there in front of you.  The workers here are also very friendly and have talked to us quite a bit each time that I have been there.  For dinner on this night my fiance and I decided to share a number of different meats and so went with the pulled pork, smoked chicken and brisket with sides of cornbread and macaroni and cheese.  We were also asked what kind of sauce we would like: spicy, regular or a combination.  We choose the combination which got us two of each which was more than enough for all of food we had ordered.  The spicy one had a nice little burn to it that seemed to grow as you ate more or it yet wasn't too spicy while the sweet one also had a flavor that I enjoyed.  One thing that was nice about all of the meats here is that you could easily taste the smoke on all of them.  My favorite of the meats that we ordered happened to be the brisket which was seasoned nicely.  The smoked chicken was my second favorite which surprised me since I am not much of a chicken on the bone type of guy.  It was moist and had a great smoky flavor that didn't overpower the chicken flavor.  Finally the pulled pork was also pretty good although not nearly as good as the other two.  As for our sides, I am not a huge cornbread fan and so only took a small nibble of it and it tasted fine.  The mac and cheese ended up being decent but it seemed to be more like something I could make out of a box than a really good mac and cheese.  Of course I should probably remember that this was a side dish at a BBQ place and not a gourmet mac and cheese at which point it was fine.  The bottom line for me is that I will be back here again in the future.  I have enjoyed all of the meats that I have had here and really enjoy their BBQ sauce as well.",

We found the smoked brisket to be better than some Pittsburgh beef bbq (Double Wide Grill) but not nearly as good as the smoked brisket at Smoq.",

All our guests loved everything - especially the cornbread. I should note that we, our families, & a good number of our friends are originally from the Carolinas, so we are pretty discerning when it comes to good BBQ... this definitely got two thumbs up all around.  They were great to work with - the servers & bartender we hired through them were fabulous & hard-working.  If I had anything negative to say at all, it would be that sometimes my email interactions with Judee were not as easy as I wanted them to be. However, she was always available via phone, and was super nice & helpful, so I'm chalking that one up to the fact that not everyone loves email as much as I do. It definitely doesn't change my rave review at all & I wouldn't hesitate to work with her/them in the future.  In fact, we're already contemplating throwing a pig roast party catered by them in the near future...  Bottom line: Delicious food, fantastic value, great people. Go here, eat here.",

I have been here many times and eaten many things - chicken, ribs, sides (mac and cheese and cornbread are to die for), but nothing, I tell you nothing, compares to the catering that can be done.  When my husband and I had our wedding party at our home, we wanted something special and unique.  So I called up Pittsburgh BBQ and ordered up a whole pig to be delivered to our Brookline home on a truck to display for all the world to see.  The whole pig arrived, was on display for about an hour and then was chopped into pulled pork deliciousness.  We also got tons of sides and had mounds of leftovers for a completely reasonable amount of money.   Have a party, get a pig, be infamous!",

    "text": "Tucked away on the way towards regions unknown lies a nice lil barbecue joint.  Though not much for seating, this is definitely a nice spot to check out if you can squeeze over here during lunch for some takeout, or want to bring home a worthy ready-to-go picnic.  PROS:  1.) Excellent Service 2.) Tasty BBQ  3.) Fair prices 4.) Amazzzzin' cornbread  CONS:  1.) Some of the sides are underwhelming 2.) Wish there was more variety of barbecue sauces 3.) Not cooked/finished to order  I'd have to say this place, as a whole, is definitely a gem. The (owner I think) gave us literally one of everything on the menu because my friend was here from the UK. He tossed us extra sides, and gave us a huge bargain. Now, onto the good bits..the actual food.  The brisket was akin to grown-up beef jerky. A tiny bit dry, but that didn't really affect my overall perception. The burnt bits surrounding the meat was a meat icing on my carnivorous cake.  The pulled chicken was interesting; I was less of a fan of it on a bun (not overly seasoned) but by itself it was far more delightful.  Pulled pork was choice. I don't think I can pick out much of a complaint here  Spare ribs/full rubs:  I much preferred the full, fattier beef ribs to the trimmed ones. Fat = awesome and I think it's a selling point to why ribs are so tasty.  Mac and cheese: Though it had promise, I am eternally against storing pasta with the sauce. This ruins the texture as the pasta absorbs the sauce. It was decent though.  Macaroni Salad: Ah, this let me down a bit too. There just wasn't much to talk about here.  Simmered Apples: Though it's not winning a complexity contest, I was completely fine with these hanging out on their own accord  Cornbread: Yea. Get the cornbread. Trust me.  Overall this ruled. My point about wanting food to order should be clarified; I think having some fresh grill marks and temperature would have been greatly appreciated, but I understand that this establishment is a little more fast service. The food is served from chafing dishes. Interestingly enough I think this is a catch 22 as smoked meats are generally prone to overdrying, and I think there would be a confict of fast service if all the food was cooked on the spot. Oh well.  Go here please. AND TELL EM BRIAN SENT YA  (please don't tell them I sent you.)",

I have to say though that this is some of the best bbq I have ever had. Like others have said, the sauce is really good without overpowering the meat. I had the ribs and the pulled pork. Both had very well balanced smoke and meat flavor.  Not only is the BBQ top rate, but the sides are outstanding. The beans had 3 kinds of beans in them, were smoky, spicy and had nice big pieces of bacon. The cornbread had big kernels of corn and was dense and moist. My favorite were the baked apples. Think of the most tasty baked apples you have ever had and you are close to what these are - amazing.  If you are within 50 miles of PIttsburgh and like BBQ, I would recommend making sure to stop here next time you are in the area. It is tucked behind a Days Inn, so keep your eyes out for the sign. Yelp gave the hours as 11-7 but it is 11-8 everyday!",

Everything is good, but these two really stand out. *Good quality - in both meat and ingredients  Negative *Horrendous location - tough to get to, weird spot. Especially if you do not live to the West of the city. Some have said it is close to downtown, which is True, but you have to go through the Fort Pitt tunnel to get there, which is usually a humongous pain to deal with.  Overall, the food is very good, great if you have a craving for BBQ, and you get a whole lot of it. Definitely the best I have found in Pittsburgh.",

Their standard grilled ribs were still good, but not as tender, do not deprive yourself of the magic that their smoker works on whatever is lovingly placed in it!  I consider myself a discerning authority on BBQ and soul food and they have some of the best smoked ribs, pulled pork and hands down the best corn bread I've ever had in my life.  The corn bread is so sweet and flaky it melts on your tongue, and it has sweet corn in it that explodes on your tongue like flavor crystals.  Conveniently located near Murrysville and Downtown Pittsburgh this is a great place to pick up food before a game or for takeout for a party.  They have picnic tables available if you want to eat there, but they are primarily geared for takeout.  They also offer signature catering including pig roasts, a fairly unique offering which I fully intend to take advantage of for my next massive party.  If you're in the area and you appreciate bbq, take advantages of PGH BBQ's massive smoker and treat yourself to some of the best soul food in Pittsburgh!",

The bark was excellent, the rub came through nicely and there was a good smoky taste.  The pulled pork was tasty as well, still moist and smoky.  The ribs were good as well, though I would have preferred some of the brisket rub on them for an extra kick.  We also tried the beans, coleslaw, and baked apples.  All were very goof representatives, and the baked apples may now be my favorite BBQ dessert. even over other traditional BBQ deserts like sweet potato pie and banana pudding.

We agreed with the decision ( can't pass on BBQ). We ordered a little of everything, meat wise.  Enough of the back story on to the BBQ. We got ribs, brisket, chicken, and pulled pork. The pulled pork totally stole the show. It was so tender with such awesome BBQ flavor. The sauce is a little on the loose side but sweet with just a little twang. Delightful! The brisket, not good for me. A little too tough in my opinion, eh. The ribs were very good as well. The meat was so tender it fell right off the bone. The hubby said the chicken was tender and tasted smokey. He liked the chicken.  And the fact that it travels well, awesome! They packaged everything up so nice and tidy.

    "text": "Best barbecue in pittsburgh! Ribs are great and moist, choice of regular and the leaner St. Louis style. You can't go wrong with either. We love the chicken here, first time I've tasted vinegar soaked roast chicken and apparently how it's made in some places in upstate new york.  Occasionally there might be a bit of a miss with us occasionally getting chicken or ribs more charred but the taste is always there so no big deal. Cornbread is the same thing, sometimes good other times just okay. All are still good when reheating at home. They give out dinner rolls which is just okay... But hey we're here for the meat not the free bread.  Their meat is so tasty and flavorful we rarely even use the sauce (there's a spicy option). There are like 3 tables outside but not a good place to eat with constructions going on across. This is mainly a takeout place, not even a bathroom for customers. Still, we will travel just to get takeout their amazing ribs and chicken.",

So why in the world would the rating be so high? Well because I was given no other choice.   After circling the area for an extra 5 min thanks to GPS we arrived at the pearly gates of BBQ heaven. Walking in Vince introduced himself to one of the very nice guys who seamed to be the manager. He came over introduced himself and even gave my boy some dabs. Once I found the menu on the right wall and had the girl at the register explain it a bit we went with 1/2 pound each of pulled pork, brisket and a ribs. The sides we chose were baked beans and corn bread. Once we had paid the girl at the counter remembered my sons name and said bye Vincent. I was very impressed.   There is a single little bench outside that was open so we took a seat. Once we started to open stuff up we realized the girl that was next to us in line got our order and we get hers. It was an honest mistake. We ended up with a pound each of pulled pork and pulled chicken. She took the bag closest to her. So Bry went in told them what happened and reappeared 5 min later with a bit of everything they had.   The pulled pork was my favorite. It was so tender and the flavor was perfect. The chicken tasted like it had been marinated in vinegar so it wasn't quite my thing. However it was cooked to perfection. The ribs were fall off the bone good even though they left the membrane on. One of the guys even told Bry there butcher takes the membrane off. So maybe they need to talk to the butcher. I have to agree the Mac and cheese isn't anything to rave about. It wasn't very creamy but My son likes it. The cornbread is amazing!!! The sauce is a vinegar sauce but it's not overpowering like so many places I have tried. I actually really liked the spicy sauce. The vinegar cut the spice nicely.   The service hear is amazing and they go out of there way to make sure you are happy and understand that it's not just about the food it's about the entire experience. I will have no issue coming back here for a yummy pulled pork sandwich with some spicy vinegar based BBQ sauce.",

So they had only been open for 2 days. The food was good but the meat was pretty dry. Being from Texas, I grew up loving brisket and I don't slather on a lot of BBQ sauce. Therefore, on to what we ordered. We got a pound each of the brisket and the pulled pork. When you order a half or full pound of meat, the Pgh BBQ Co includes bread in round buns or long rolls. My husband used the round buns with his pulled pork and I used the long rolls for my sliced brisket. So, we each ate BBQ sandwiches and I had to put mayonnaise on my brisket sandwich since I didn't care so much for their BBQ sauce and don't like to cover the BBQ flavor of the brisket meat. My husband also go potato salad which was creamy but could have used more flavoring and seasoning. I also got the stewed apples which was good, but I was hoping they would be sweeter like the kind you would find in an apple pie. There are no tables at this restaurant except a table outside, and it is still too chilly to sit outside to eat during mid-March. So, the best bet is to buy it to take home.",

I honestly really believed for the longest time that the only way you could enter in is if you were coming from town! I just realized you can turn at the hotel and make your way along the gravel drive. Not the most convenient, but if you want BBQ, you find a way to get it!  Since passing them day after day I was eager to try and I will say they did not disappoint. I like the idea that you can get a combo meal. So one meat and two sides, plus a drink. And it's a lot of food! I ate for two days after! I ordered up the brisket, which was tender. The baked beans, which had a mixture of beans in a tangy sauce and the cornbread. It was the gooood cornbread too. You know, the kind that's made with bits of corn in it. Plus, they gave me a bun for the brisket to make a sammie. I liked the sauce too, it tasted strong of vinegar and wasn't very thick.   My hubby, on the other hand, was not a fan of his meal at all. Weird since mine was so good! I can't speak for the ribs, because I didn't try them, but I took a bite of his mac n' cheese and it was AWFUL! It tasted very weird. I was really surprised considering BBQ places usually do it up big with the mac. Bummer.  I'd for sure go back, but maybe avoid the mac.",

    "text": "Homina, homina, homina....  I rolled up on a Friday afternoon for a couple sandwiches before they close for the season.  The smell is amazing.  The menu here is modest, which is good.  I don't need to many options when it comes to BBQ.  I decided on the pulled pork and chicken as well as a side of cole slaw.  The gentleman filling my order asked me if I'd like the meat packaged separately instead of him assembling the sandwiches since this was a to-go order.  I thanked him for his wonderful idea.  My order was filled quickly and I was on my way, drooling from the enticing aroma.    I'll get the bad news out of the way first.  The cole slaw was dry and did not seem fresh.  I'm guessing they make a batch for the whole week on Wednesday and by Friday it's not so good.  But I can forgive the dry cole slaw only because the pulled pork was a thing of beauty.  When I opened the container, I was overjoyed to see the seasoned and burnt ends carelessly mingling with the pink colored smoke ring and some other bits and pieces.  Often pulled pork does not include the ends so it looks pretty and more presentable.  I prefer this messy hodge podge that contains all the flavor.  The sauce was good, but honesty, I didn't even think that the pulled pork needed it.  The pulled chicken was presented much the same way but I did add some sauce to it.  Should I talk about the portions?  I had enough for 3 sandwiches from each container.  Had it been assembled for eating there I'm not sure I would have received as much...or my sandwich would have been overflowing with meaty goodness.    I should thank Darren W for his info but also update it.  Yes, Pittsburgh Barbecue Company is on Banksville Avenue.  The Days Inn is a good landmark to watch for as PBC is just behind it.  If you are on Banksville Road heading into town, the left turn for Banksville Avenue is just before the Days Inn (and if you pay attention you will see a small sign that directs you to BBQ).  There is no median to block the way now and there is a turning lane.  If you are on Banksville Road heading away from town, you will be making a right turn on to Banksville Avenue just after passing the Days Inn.  There is also a street sign that you may not notice coming the other way.  It should also be noted that they have restricted hours.  They are only open Wednesday through Sunday and are closed from November until March.  They also have an outdoor tent with picnic chairs in case you just can't wait to get home.    I know it's almost time for PBC to close up shop, but making it over for another round before November is definitely on my to-do list.",

Where they totally get it wrong is with the sides. Complete fail on everything I've had. The potato salad is completely flavorless, I added a little salt & pepper at home which helped but.... and the same thing with the coleslaw. It wasn't sweet or tangy or vinegary, or anything really. Just some cabbage that tasted not quite fresh. The corn bread was greasy! It was literally DRIPPING oil when I unwrapped it. I've never seen a wet-looking cornbread before, maybe it's supposed to be like that? Idk dude. The biggest disappointment tho by far was the mac n cheese. It's soggy noodles that are barely holding together. I did not even taste any cheese, like at all. They keep it in a crock pot/ soup warmer so maybe that's why it's so over cooked and ratchet.

    "text": "Note #1: Pittsburgh Barbecue Company is actually on Banksville AVENUE, not Banksville Road. Look for the Days Inn motel; PBC is right next door.   Note #2: PBC is strictly carry-out, and there is no need to call ahead. You just walk in, tell the folks behind the counter what you want, they ring you out, and your meal's boxed up for you to take away. Everything's ready to eat immediately.   On a secret, gravel-studded street off of Banksville Road sits a house of stained wooden slats. Spectral vapors can be seen floating into the air from a tin chimney only to vanish into a powder blue sky that serves as a backdrop for an early Spring evening. A campfire aroma will comfort your nostrils as vehicles race up and down the highway--you will briefly forget that you're in a major Northeastern city.   The other day, I treated my family to another bring-it-home banquet, finally getting down to trying PBC after years of procrastination.  What we found were St. Louis Ribs that were fat with luscious pork that almost pulled itself from the bone and blushed when torn into.   Speaking of which, the pulled pork sandwich was tall with protein, crisp skin, and sweet, blackened debris.   A runny, vinegary sauce with just enough bite to it dressed the smoked animal flesh.  Whatever fires that burned in our traps were extinguished by a fresh, vibrant, crunchy cole slaw.   A lackluster macaroni and cheese was kicked out for loitering while a serving of baked apples arrived fashionably late, stealing the spotlight with its wealthy, fruity, pie-filling lava.   If barbecue is a science, PBC should at least be nominated for a Nobel Prize.   I only wish they'd add potato salad to their menu.  My personal food obsessions notwithstanding, fly down to Banksville and take home some sapid, smoldering Southern fast food for you and yours. You'll win hearts and minds.",

Our guests spent most of their time debating which protein was the best. We've been eating the leftovers for days.  It's also worth mentioning that we had them provide two servers and a bartender. They were all wonderfully nice and extremely helpful.  I wouldn't hesitate for a heartbeat to use Pittsburgh BBQ again for a future event.",

    "text": "These guys catered the Memorial Day event at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall in Oakland.   My wife and I got a pulled pork sandwich with the Mac and cheese and baked beans to share.  The Mac and cheese was pretty good and I enjoyed that there was a hint of pepper to it. The baked beans have a variety of beans which makes it a little more fun that your regular baked bean varieties.   The pulled pork was quite good! There was a generous portion provided and it was still nice and moist. The homemade bbq sauce was just the cherry on top.   I don't know if I would consider it $10.00 dollars good, but I'd probably come back :)",

The staff was incredibly professional, efficient, knowledgeable and friendly.  One of the servers actually found me tucked away in a side room while my mother was hopelessly trying to bustle my dress to ensure that I got some of the appetizer mini pierogies.  Our bartender was equally wonderful.  She set up our bar perfectly, warned us before we ran out of ice and stayed late to help us break things down.  Of course a huge thank you goes to the owner, Art Cohen.  He was actually there at our wedding making sure everything ran perfectly.  He called me several times in the weeks proceeding our wedding to see if I needed anything and he took charge.  I have never worked with a better catering company and I will definitely be looking to hire his company again.  Thank you Art and thank you to your incredible staff!  You all made our wedding absolutely perfect!! Love, Mia and Brian",

We grabbed food yesterday to take to a family gathering. Pulled, pork, chicken, brisket, mac and cheese, greens and cole slaw. They provided the fresh rolls, spicy and mild barbecue sauce and even offered plates and flatware. All this for food for a large group for under $100! And, best part, leftovers!!

The location is near a local hotel. I had the beef brisket with two sides and drink. I wish they had sweet southern tea. The portions were great and the food was hot. The brisket was tender and BBQ sauce on the side was good too. The potato salad was decent and the Mac/Cheese was fine (doesn't beat my mothers though)!  I plan on going back to try the pulled pork and ribs next time plus some different sides.  Only drawback was they need more covered seating.",

The sides were plentiful. The potato salad not to be missed. Ordered the collard greens on the pretense of a healthy side and would give that a pass next time. But I wouldn't think twice about ordering anything else. And of course get a cookie. They are made specially for the restaurant. Highly recommend.",

Fantastic on both counts. Also, the mac and cheese was delicious. The coleslaw wasn't really my cup of tea, but the brisket and mac and cheese was more than enough. If I go again, I'll only get one meat and one side, it was definitely enough to keep me full for a while. Also, their sauces were really good.

There is plenty of parking, so it's easy to swing by and carry out.  The pulled-pork is just right.  It has a slightly sweet, smokey flavor, and is very moist.  They mix the pork well, so you'll get some stringy inside bits and some slightly charred \"bark\" outer bits, too, which I like.  Their sides are excellent as well:  The baked beans have a mix of bean types, and a bit of hot \"bite\" in the mix.  The beans are not over cooked to mush like some BBQ places do.  The corn-bread is very good, too.  It is NOT sweet corn-bread (some BBQ places do sweet corn-bread that's more like a corn muffin).  It is dense and heavy, but just tastes great.  Finally, I find this place to offer a great value.  I get a pound of pulled pork, some fresh buns (wrapped in foil, thank you), and a couple of sides and it feeds my family of five, sometimes with left-overs.",

I asked them to cut it a bit thicker but it was extremely tough and needed more time on the smoker. The ribs were over cooked and gummy. The silver skin (thin membrane on the underside of the rib) hasn't been removed so that made it hard to eat.   They didn't even finish cooking the corn bread. It was almost raw dough.

That said, if your expectation is BBQ from a part of the country that's famous for it, then you're going to be disappointed - not just here though, but everywhere in Pittsburgh.  Otherwise, this is really solid BBQ. I've enjoyed all of their meats that I've tried (brisket, pulled pork, ribs). Very good value/prices, too.  Their cornbread is one of my favorites I've ever had - it's dense, cake-like, and a little sweet.  The only miss here is the Mac n Cheese. It's really not very good: flavorless and even a little soggy.",
