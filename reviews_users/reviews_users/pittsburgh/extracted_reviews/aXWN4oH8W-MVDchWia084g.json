    "text": "Incredible experience!  My boyfriend and I went to Nine On Nine for dinner as we had received a gift certificate to this restaurant, which was a great excuse for us to venture downtown. It was confusing at first as when we had entered the restaurant we were in the bar room, thriving with activity and no one had greeted us, though soon realized we needed to walk through into the next room (such newbs!). The atmosphere was cozy with dim lighting and modern decor. You just wanted to snuggle up with somebody in a corner.  We looked at the menu and were having issues deciding between dishes until seeing that they were both on the tasting menu. At that moment we had decided to go big and try the eight 'small' course tasting which from there our culinary adventure began. Looking back on what and how much we ate I wish I had not done the rookie mistake of eating the bread. Every bite was delicious and each course was better than the last until we got to desert. I am not a big chocolate eater but will try it anyway if it is in front of me. I just didn't get it but was so full by then I was okay on not finishing. That aside we were both really impressed by caliber of the tasting and while it isn't an everyday thing for us we would hands down go back and do it again. The waiter was awesome - paced the courses well, checked on us periodically and answered our questions on the food. If you can splurge the dollars on a meal I would do it on the tasting menu at Nine On Nine.",

    "text": "A-OK.  Great internal ambience, wide selection of interesting food, terrific portions that are larger than expected without being too big.  I had the Moroccan Tuna, which was impressively plated, and had the most wonderful flavor to it, but just didn't have much going on as a whole; it needed a side dish or second course served simultaneously to not get bored with the same taste over and over again.  The tuna itself was good enough to eat raw, but probably was destined to be sliced thinner; the butterknife I had wasn't quite enough to go cross-grain.  The other person I ate with had the venison, which was the exact opposite of my dish; at least five distinct flavors on the plate, almost too much going on, but pretty darn awesome nonetheless.  This seemed to be the winner on the menu, from what we could tell.  Was told we were getting bread, and had to ask for it from another waiter after the first course because it'd been forgotten.  They forgot a steak knife with the venison.  Overall, service was slowish, although never so slow that it was a problem.  The \"French 75\" at the bar was probably the best I've had.    For $75ish a person (three courses, one drink) plus another $12 on a drink at the bar waiting for our reservation, it just didn't feel worth going back anytime soon; at that price range, I'm looking for amazing, outstanding, perfect, superb... not just A-OK.  I might head back for lunch sooner, as that seems to be reviewed well.",

We appreciated that the hostess was accomodating- our table was originally near the door and when we requested to be moved it was no problem.  Our waitress, while overall pretty good, was very slow in coming to the table to greet us and take drink orders. I ordered a cosmo and it was made Perfectly- I only wish the glass had been filled instead of the short pour I got.    The food is very good. I had the special lamb chops and, while a little more fatty than I prefer, were tasty and cooked to my specifications.",

We were stuck with a fixed menu on valentine's day without warning when made reservations.  We should have gotten up and left when initially seated like others next to us did.  All the food was served with cream or cheese (forget healthy options at this establishment).  I wish I could comment on the full menu, but they didn't give us the option!  The decor seemed out of style, loud, and very smokey from the kitchen.  Creme Brulee was way too sweet and un-edible.  Stick with Eleven or other options downtown.",

The waitstaff were prompt and attentive throughout and able to answer all of our questions regarding ingredients and preparations. The varied assortment of breads that were served once seated was delicious. We were off to a good start. The menu included many seasonal choices. We had the 9on9 salad and steak tartare to start. The portions were very generous and the flavors of everything on the plate were varied and creative. I was skeptical about the white chocolate and red peppercorn but it was actually delicious with the tartare and not as sweet as I would have thought and I made sure to use it all! We had the salmon and duck entrees. Both were prepared perfectly according to our preferences and again, all the accompaniments were creative and delicious. I was amazed by the preparation of the popcorn risotto. I had never heard of this before but loved it and will try it myself at home (good luck to me!) We had a lovely evening and a wonderful dinner and I would go back in a minute! Can't wait 'til the next time.",

    "text": "I'd been to this restaurant before for a weekday lunch.  After a good experience and some very tasty chicken, I decided to return with some out-of-town friends for dinner.  We started off by ordering some appetizers and a bottle of wine.  It seemed to take a while for the appetizers to come out, but when they arrived they were very tasty:  asparagus salad, mussels, soft shell crab.  However, this was when all went downhill.  After waiting nearly an hour after our appetizers for our entrees, we noticed that all of the wait staff had disappeared into the kitchen, and that NO ONE in the restaurant had any food at their table.  Through a window into the kitchen, I could see the manager was also in the kitchen holding a child, which I did not find appropriate at a fine dining restaurant.   There was one frenzied girl scurrying about refilling everyone's water - we asked her to check on our entrees, only for her to never return to our table.  When our waiter finally reappeared, my husband couldn't get out more than \"Excuse me -\" before the waiter cut him off by snipping at us \"It's coming!\" and running away.  At this point we noticed other patrons getting up and leaving the restaurant, and were literally getting up from our chairs when suddenly everyone's entrees appeared from the kitchen at once.  At this point we asked to speak with the manager.  When we told him about our disatisfaction with the slow service, he first tried to tell us that their dinner service is intentionally that slow, but later admitted that the service was \"a little slower than usual\" and that he \"didn't know why\".  In addition to slow service, our entrees were not up to the standard of the appetizers we had - extremely salty and overcooked squab, raw scallops, cold risotto.  After our complaints, the manager offered to pay for desserts, but we told him we'd rather not stay.  He then offered a gift certificate for us to return, but we all agreed we had no desire to return.  In the end, the restaurant did pick up our entire tab.  I give them credit for this, but I feel that given the poor service, the denial, and continuous lack of apologies, it was deserved.  Thankfully, there is a good selection of other fine restaurants in Pittsburgh, so I will not have to return to Nine on Nine.",

    "text": "Good for you \"Nine on NIne\".  I'm really happy I have a reason to update my review and add another star. It's fitting that I wrote the first review for this joint almost a year ago and 12 short months later there is marked improvement in food qualilty for price.  The space remains beautiful and the staff has gotten even better with the addition of Angel who last worked at \"Dish\" in the southside.  She's a True pro and knows how to make a good dirty martini.  My review really pertains mostly to \"Bar NIne\" which is off of the main dining room and has a smaller bar menu.  I'm also going to focus this review mainly on the food since I noted ambiance and servie prior.  I'm not familiar with the current chef (Rick DeShantz), but I know he's not the chef who prepared my food the last time I was here and they may have had a few chefs the past couple of years including a brief stint of talented chef (Kevin D'Sousa) which I think has had a few stints including red room and a few weeks at this place.  I was here at about 730 on Tuesday after spending some time at the new downtown office site.  Gus, Tom and I found plenty of open seating at the bar.  They stuck mostly with beer (pretty good selection of micros/imports) and I had a stiff dirty martini and a glass of great shiraz (two hands I think?), a little pricey at $15 a glass, but this really isn't the kind of place you should go on a budget.  We started with a nice generous selection of three or four cheeses.  I don't recall the exact types, but they were great quality cheeses, served room temperature with a little fruit.  The price of $15 was also pretty good for what we got.  I was at mio in aspinwall a few weeks ago and got a similiar cheese plate with less quantitiy for $25.  Next we tried the \"Kobe\" sliders which were really amazing.  The meat was extremely flavorful cooked medium rare and served with braised short rib (very rich and tender).  They also had some crispy shallots (their version of onion rings I guess).  The only thing missing is that Gus asked for one without the blue cheese and unfortunately they didn't serve any with cheese.  We also tried the pate which was very rich and a good sized portion of rich flavorful well seasoned chicken liver some pickled vegetables and roasted toast points.  We had to ask for a few more toast points, but not a big deal and no extra cost.  Next we moved on to the \"salmon pizza\".  This was great quality smoked salmon on a crispy pita/tortilla type thing served with an aioi (mayo) with a lemon/caper flavor.  They also scattered some jalepeno and micro greens on top.  We also tried their version of ahi tuna.  It was totally \"deconstructed\" and it looks like the chef has some fun toys in the back because it was one of the few \"molecular gastronomy\" dishes I've tried that I really liked.  He did something where he took like the essence of olives (puree) and somehow formed it into a gentle ball that spilled the essence out when punctured (like a soft boiled egg).  He also turned the tomatoe into some type of jelly.  And of course the tuna was cooked perfectly.  Finally, we had the calamari which was perfectly tender grilled octupus with a nice light sauce.  The calamari was stuffed with some type of sausage and was also another hit.  We may have sampled something else I'm forgetting, but this chef didn't miss a beat all night long.  I am very happy I'll be downtown and will most certainly become a regular at bar nine.  A few other things to note.  For some reason they have a relatively extensive sake menu.  This is a \"foodie\" (hate that term) place.  Lots of interesting items cooked in unique ways.  I took my girlfriend home a dessert of carrot cake.  This was also deconstructed and looked beautiful with the nuts, and other sauces drizzled on the side of the cake.  She would have probably preferred just chocolate cake, but nothing on this menu is ordinary.",

The interior is what you would expect from a fine dining establishment, white table cloth and classic decor which was nicely lit.  Since it was during our lunch hour, we each ordered only an entree.  My dining companion had the Pappadella while I had the Steak and Frites.  The pappeadella was fantastic with a ton of flavor.  Not to be outdone, the Steak was also very good and I could not stop eating the Frites which had truffle salt. Everything from the Steak and pappardale to the fries were served at the perfect temperature .  The service was also excellent.  The bottom line for me is that this was the best lunch that I have eaten downtown this year.  The service, the food and even the price (less than $30 pretip) all created a perfect storm and I look forward to trying a dinner here in the future.",

We actually were graced with a history lesson on each item (sides included) I actually had to stop him and tell him we were already set to order. It was an emotional rollercoaster for him after that. I have never felt so uncomfortable by the wait staff in my life. I realize that all of this makes me sound pretentious but truly the food didn't make up for the bothersome and intrusive service. I hope that they find the balance because I was really rooting for this east abolishment and the location is perfect. Cheers to being hopeful!",

    "text": "I'm going to be all over the place with this review.  That will pretty much match the experience I had here.    First drink, PERFECTION!  I chose the White Grapefruit Cosmopolitan with Absolut Ruby Red, white cranberry juice and lime.  Second drink, not so much.  Way too much white cranberry juice and not enough Absolut.  No one likes a weak drink, lame!  Since it was my first time here, I didn't realize that if you sit outside, you're only allowed to order off the bar menu.  I like that and I don't.  The \"cheap\" side of me likes it because, well, I'm cheap.  Cheap here equals $16 compared to $32 for a full menu item.  The other part of me thinks if it's a nice night out, why wouldn't I want to dine outside with a full menu.  Whatevs, no biggie.  My eyes zeroed in on the Lobster Mac-N-Cheese, of course!  And for $16 it better be darn good!  Totally worth it.  The cheese was nice and creamy with big pieces of lobster and bread crumbs on the top.  I'd give that 4 stars!  We also ordered a mix between a meat, cheese and Charcuterie Platter.  So the cheese, solid (how do you mess cheese up?).  Sweet pickles, best part of the platter.  The meat....straight outta the Giant Eagle deli section.  It was a poor mans excuse for prosciutto and bologne.  Gross.  Don't order!  Factor in pretty inconsistent service between our server being there ALL the time to totally disappearing at the end of the meal when we wanted the check and you've got a iffy experience.  I'm not throwing in the towel, I would come back and try out the full menu in the dining room.  All I would ask for is a complete package...that's not too much to ask for, is it?!",

    "text": "Food 4 Service 4 Decor 4 Atmosphere 4  My boyfriend visited me at Pittsburgh and took me to this place. He had made a reservation, and our table was ready when we arrived. So we got seated immediately. Our server came shortly to greet us, and offer us water. We knew exactly what we wanted, the taster menu, so we went ahead and put our order in. The service was pretty good, our server described every course that was served and check up on us to see if everything was good in the middle of every course. However, some courses were served by the another server, who explained the meal to us, and our server would come by and do it again. So it was a tad bit disorganized.   The decor of this place was similar to any nice fine dining place. We were seated next to the full pane windows, so we could see Pittsburgh outside, so that was nice. The atmosphere was nice and intimate, so its nice for a date setting. We had a table next to us, who was a group of 5. They had a few to drink, so they got a little loud towards the end of the night.   Finally the food. The meal started off very well. The bread served was delicious. We had the rosemary bread, chocolate bread and current bread with delicious whipped almond butter. The chocolate bread and rosemary bread was delicious. We asked for seconds. Our server warned us not to eat too much or we might not finish the meal (which was good for him to do), but he served it to us, and we happily nibbled away.   The first course of the taster menu was a pumpkin bisque with cinnamon marshmallow. This was delicious, rich and creamy. The drops of vinaigrette, which balanced the sweetness of the marshmallow and pumpkin. This left us licking our spoons by the end of the dish and eagerly anticipating for the next.   Next was the bone marrow with foie and toasted rye bread. This was absolutely divine. The bone marrow was silky and creamy and melted in your mouth along with the foie. The rustic flavor of the foie combined with the richness of the bone marrow was a burst of flavor in the mouth. More over, the play with texture, with the crunch of the crispy bread and the silkiness of the bone marrow and the foie melting in our mouths. We were scraping the edges of the plate for more.   Next was the truffle risotto. This had good flavor. The risotto was a good consistency. It could have been more aldente in my perspective, but my boyfriend liked it, so it is a matter of preference. Nonetheless, still a great dish.   Next was the scallop with sriracha foam, candied carrots and capers. We were exited to hear about the srirach foam, however, the flavor did not quite come out. The scallops were perfectly cooked though, with a seared crusty layer on the outside, and the tenderness of the meat when you bite into the scallop.   Next was the foie gras with seasonal preparation, which was mainly berries and candied hazelnuts. I like the crunch the nuts added to the dish. The sweet and sourness of the berries also gave the foie gras a nice touch, cutting through the fattiness. My boyfirend thought the berries overpowered the foie gras, he prefers the traditional apply or pear paring, but I thought it was good.   Next was our pallet cleanser. Mojito sorbet. This was when the meal, for me, started to plato, or maybe even gradually decline (The food was not bad, it was just not great, and did not compare with the previous courses). We were excited to hear that we got mojito sorbet, but when we tried it, the sorbet was simply too sweet, especially for a pallet cleanser. It also did not have the citrusy lime taste and minty taste of mojitos, but rather had a more sugary taste.   Next we had the hanger steak with carrot and smoked potatoes. Maybe cause I am not a potato fan, or I was just really full, but there was nothing special about the potatoes to make me want to eat them after all those previous courses. The hanger steak was a little too well done and chewy for me, which was a let down from the previous courses. The steak was well seasoned though. However, it did not leave me wanting more.   Finally, dessert...we had switched our dessert from the original three chocolate option on the menu to a kulfi like dessert with toaster merengue on top. This was a decent dessert. To be honest thought, it looked better than it tasted -- considering they it on fire and everything in front of us. For dessert, I usually judge how good it is by if I want to finish it even if I am really full (which I usually am). This was a dessert where you, poke at a few times, but is not so heavenly that you will devour the whole thing after a full meal.   All in all, the beginning of the meal was amazing, but then started to go on a gradual decline towards the end. The dishes at the end were not bad, they just set our expectations very high in the beginning, and could not live up to them. I would recommend going here for a date, or a nice intimate meal.",

    "text": "Some of my work friends and I ordered takeout from the lunch menu. Because it was restaurant week, we just decided to order the restaurant week menu: soup, salad, and 1/2 a sandwich. It was nice of them to accomodate us with our takeout request, so that was much appreciated.  I had 1/2 of a turkey club (with real applewood smoked bacon and real, oven roasted turkey on toasty bread), a small garden salad, and the soup of the day, which happened to be cream of mushroom. The salad was on the small side, as in there were only about five pieces of lettuce and two small grape tomatoes, but the dressing was nice and light, and for lunch, this was plenty of food.  The sandwich was delicious, even without the mayo. Win! The bread was fresh and lightly toasted, and the sandwich was large for being just 1/2 of a sandwich. My favorite item was the mushroom soup. Super creamy, yet there was enough tang from the mushrooms to cut through the cream. Really delicious.   Needless to say, I just had a small sampling of the lunch menu, so I look forward to reviewing the dinner menu soon!",

    "text": "Last Friday I felt like the ultimate party crasher yet, judging by the sandwich board signage, I thought I was invited.   My boyfriend and I were excited to celebrate Friday  happy hour and, instead of the usual spot, I convinced him to go to Bar Nine at Nine on Nine. Why try and convince him? Because the last two experiences within the year were not so good.  Let me start by saying it is definitely NOT the food. After we literally had to send a \"Bat\" signal to get the attention of the unmotivated bartenders and snarky host, we had the opportunity to order from the bar menu. The truffle fries didn't last long...so good ...and I love  the presentation in wax paper cone. The Kobe Beef sliders were delicious, flavorful, meaty. And, last but not least, the Lobster Mac'n Cheese. It was the perfect amount of cheese, lobster, and seasonings.  Also, the wine list and happy hour specials are a VERY good deal. (SUGGESTION: Combine with tapas or other bar menu specials to compete with the other restaurants Downtown.)  So why can't the staff be nicer! We came in with smiles. Even \"God Blessed\" the bartender who had the sniffles! What is with the ATTITUDE! THREE TIMES WITHIN THE YEAR.   Here's an idea. Try smiling. Smiling and eye contact can boost a 20% tip to 30% or even 50%! Especially when there are only 8 customers and you have the time to give face. And, offering water to everyone else, including the very rude, loud gentleman on his cell phone sitting next to us was a bit of an insult -- not to mention your attempts to make conversation with him to see if he was comfortable and needed anything (I guess he was a loyal since you were on a first name basis).   Wow. We must have a new superpower of invisibility only known to the NON staff.  I really tried to shake this off and move on but, sorry, you not only ruined our Friday night, you insulted the many great restaurant staff within the Pittsburgh area that we would have graciously given our money to, who always deserve it. Training staff to take ownership of their brands and appreciate guests who can be potential loyals is so important. I see it  at its best with young restaurant hosts, servers, bartenders, etc. in Portland, Oregon. And, newsflash, it's a revenue and traffic builder.  So...with that in mind. I will miss the 5 or 6 course Valentine's Day dinner we had in February 2012 and the happy hour menu (damn it, I love those sliders!) But, I guess it's good news that they will no longer be bothered with our patronage.",

    "text": "My experience here was a mixed bag.   We went in around 7:45 on a Friday evening without a reservation and were able to get seated before the bartender even had a chance to finish making my white grapefruit martini which was very refreshing.  For dinner, I opted to start with the spring salad minus the pig ear bacon.   This was FABULOUS!!!  I would have ordered a second one if it wasn't $10.  I followed this up with the Tagliatelle Pasta (tomatoes, garlic and squash, oh my) which could have been amazing but was only so-so because I was served the most undercooked pasta ever.   The flavors in the dish were awesome.  I wanted to lick the plate but it was hard to get past the chewy pappardelle noodles (not tagliatelle) which were 2 minutes short of al dente.   I did mention this to the waiter who passed along the info to the chef which I appreciated (witnessed it since the kitchen is so open).  We passed on a dessert which is a rarity because they just didn't have many options and the ones they did weren't up our alley.   I was craving cheesecake or some kind of fall dessert (maybe an apple turnover).  Now here's the weird part.  When the bill came, there were only three items on the menu (my dinner wasn't listed).  I thought my pasta had been comped because it was so undercooked but then I realized the items in the bill totaled $16 less than the total bill  (ie something was in the total that wasn't in the itemized listing).  It just so happened to be my pasta.  When I pointed it out the waiter, he just said it was an error in the system.  Perhaps I'm reading into it, but I just thought it was shady that I was paying for it but it wasn't appearing on the bill.   I don't know; must be the accountant in me.  The inside of the restaurant is pleasant and the service was so-so.  The waiter was a little inattentive given how few tables were filled.   Overall though, I was pretty pleased.   I really loved their use of flavors so I was more than willing to pay the higher-end prices but I was disappointed in my undercooked pasta.",

However, the Peking Duck was amazing and, what's more, I was told that the Head Chef actually came in just to make it for me. I feel that kind of service, where someone goes well out of their way to accommodate a hungry guest, warrants a high rating and a positive review. To top it all off I had the French Chocolate Cake drizzled with raspberry sauce and that was also amazing. The service was very friendly and I also liked the outdoor seating.

    "text": "While Nine On Nine seems to offer a wonderful dining experience to many, I can't say I had a great time during my meal here. From the moment we walked in the door I knew I wasn't going to have a great dinner.  The fact that it took an incredibly long time for the staff to come and seat us should have been a hint that this was not the dining establishment for me. When they did finally seat us, we were put at an uncomfortable high table in a dark, creepy, melancholic corner in the back of the bar area. It was either sit there, or sit at the table right by the door, where we'd shiver every single time someone opened the door.   After waiting even longer for the staff to bring us a menu, we gave up and went to pick one up from the front ourselves, and then proceeded to squint and try to read said menu in our dark and poorly lit corner. Unfortunately their one-page dinner menu did not impress me at all; I spent more time mulling over the ten page booklet that was their wine menu. I've said before, I'm a girl who likes real choice on her menu. This was the exact opposite of that.  I also really wasn't too excited to try much on this menu. The items on it just didn't really match my palette. When I tried one of these main dishes, which my guest ordered and offered to share, I was proven correct in my fears. The lobster mac and cheese just...tasted...off. I still can't put my finger on why, either. It wasn't outright bad, but one bite later I knew I wouldn't ever be ordering the dish for myself.  I eventually ordered the kobe beef sliders and noticed when the sliders came out that they were on mini poppy seed buns, which the menu didn't mention (I don't particularly love poppy seed anything). The menu also didn't bother telling us what exactly Nine On Nine put on the sliders other than ketchup and meat. I honestly still don't know what I ate. It was an ok combo, but not at all what I expected, and just a little offputting.  While any one of these things isn't a dealbreaker, together they led to a very unimpressive dining experience. Honestly I really have no intention of coming here again, seeing as my night at Nine On Nine can be summed up in one word: disappointing.",

    "text": "The food tasted good. We started with the mushroom risotto and added the truffle shavings. I highly recommend it. It actually overshadowed the main course.  The atmosphere was very classy and is fitting for a fancy dinner.  However the service was lacking. About 30 minutes after we received the appetizer the server came over and asked me what the entree I ordered was. We waited about another 15 minutes for our food. My steak was cooked properly but my wife's salmen was over cooked and dry. Judging by the temperature of her plate it must have been sitting under the heat lamps for a long time. For the price they charge for food they shouldn't have served it like that. She should have sent it back but didn't since it already took 45 minutes and she wanted to eat with me. If she had sent it back I would have been finished by the time the re cooked her order. It's a good thing she decided that because the server didn't check on us until we were finished eating.  The desert met our expectation and we were pleased with it.  Overall I think it is too pricy for the portions and the lack of proper service. We might have gone back despite of the service since the food did taste very good. With the kitchen sacrificing food quality and integrity for saving on their food cost, we will not be back.",

Their RW menu offered choice of Tomato Bisque or the Soup du Jour (Chicken Curry today) and a choice of a brisket sandwich or blackened tilapia Pittsburgh salad. I opted for the Chicken Curry soup and salad and both were very solid choices. My man had the opposite menu and wasn't as impressed, but good thing his company was so stellar.  At $15 I can't complain. Our server was courteous and quick and we were in and out in less than an hour. The place was empty and the manager? seemed to be having a bit of a bad day, but other than that, I enjoyed myself thoroughly.",

Someone quickly arrived to inquire about drinks, which was nice. Our waitress was attentive and my two drinks were always filled. I didn't have any alcoholic beverages so I can't comment on that. The menu first called for a salad and when I first saw it I thought it was just some lettuce leaves and a little pile of veggies. It was actually incredibly delicious and I kept commenting on the homemade balsamic dressing (you can buy it too!). The veggies were wonderfully seasoned and very tasty. Next we had chicken which was SO GOOD! Not overcooked at all. Everything tasted on point and flowed so well. I cleared my plate. For dessert I had creme brulee and that was just fabulous too. Of course everything was presented so nicely on the plates.  The atmosphere was pretty nice - it was a tad darker than I would have liked but that's not big deal. There was music in the background with a lot of songs that I knew, which was fun. I do have to say their bathroom was very clean and updated. I would definitely come back!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were looking to eat at one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh and Nine On Nine frequently came up in our search. The place lives up to its title. Nine On Nine would have gotten five stars if it weren't for our server Todd's attitude.   The food was phenomenal. We ordered the foie gras, lobster mac n cheese, duck breast, and diver scallops. The foie gras was tiny, but excellent. I wish there was double the amount, but then it would have cost twice as much! The lobster mac n cheese was good, but it is rich and filling. I wouldn't recommend it if you plan on feasting here.  The diver scallops were cooked to perfection and probably the best I ever had. The scallops are served with spaghetti squash and a sweet potato puree--a great combination. The duck was also cooked to perfection and served with heirloom carrots and couscous (supposedly). The couscous looked and tasted like red quinoa. However, I really enjoyed a little bit of all three in each bite.   For dessert we ordered the warm honey cornbread. I'm not sure it was sweet enough to be considered dessert, but it was good nonetheless.   We also ordered what we were told was deconstructed red velvet. When our server brought it over, it was brown, not red. He told us the pastry chef did not use enough dye, or something like that. As we ate it, we realize that it tastes nothing like red velvet--it tastes like chocolate cake. My boyfriend believes he overheard another server telling his table it was deconstructed devil's food cake. When our server brought us the bill, it said devil cake and not red velvet. So, we were told they were serving red velvet. We ordered red velvet. And we did not receive red velvet. But we paid for it anyway. Not happy about that. We got a good laugh out of it though.  Service was good--poured our glasses of wine properly, checked back after each course, bussed and set our table after each course. However, his attitude was piss poor. Our reservation was for 830 and they close at 10. He immediately did not look happy to see us or serve us. It was obvious. Too bad! You're there to work and make money. It's your job.   The experience would have been so much better if our server liked us and we liked him.",

    "text": "***The chefs at Nine On Nine did a good job sourcing and cooking proteins (foie gras, squab); while I was not a huge fan of all of the flavor combinations, there is definitely good food here even if it is a little expensive***  Nine On Nine is a fine dining spot located in Downtown Pittsburgh (not too far from PNC Park and apparently near some theaters in the city).  The restaurant has a small neighborhood restaurant or cafe feel with hardwood floors and an open (but cozy and not industrial) kitchen.  The restaurant's decor feels very warm and approachable, but the menu sounds quite ambitious.  Nine On Nine has a tasting menu as well as ingredients you don't often see like squab.  The bread was standard stuff.  There was a mix of focaccia, country bread and a decent and hearty fruit and nut bread.  The bread was sliced unevenly, but I did like the creamy whipped butter, which was topped with strong salt.  I started with the seared foie gras, which was a small portion.  The foie gras was garnished with spring onion marmalade, brioche, gelatin, and crispy meringue-like pieces.  There were a lot of sweet elements on the plate, but they went well with the foie gras, which had an expected salty flavor.  I thought the onion marmalade was very good--definitely sweet but still with an onion flavor.  I liked the brioche--great outside sear but still soft and moist.  The foie gras was good--buttery, creamy and flavorful.  For my entree, I went with the squab, which featured both the breast and the legs.  The squab was served with hominy, chorizo, zucchini, arugula, and lemon.  I thought the squab was very good.  The breast was moist, juicy and tender.  It was a little like duck breast but had a bouncier texture.  The legs were crispy and good.  I liked all the sides individually though it was not my favorite combination of flavors.  There was definitely a strong lemon flavor to the dish.  For dessert, I had the coconut panna cotta, which was garnished with compressed pineapple, kiwi, pink peppercorn brittle, and a kaffir lime sauce.  The panna cotta was good.  It did not have a strong coconut flavor, but I liked the creaminess and lightness of it.  The fruit was really good.  I liked the brightness, sweetness and tartness that the pineapple and kiwi provided.  The brittle was on the chewy side and did not have that crunch and snap you get with a lot of brittle (but I still liked it).  The brittle had a very strong pink peppercorn flavor.  The kaffir lime sauce did not add much to the plate.  It did not have a distinct flavor.  It did not have a bad flavor, but I was not a fan of the consistency, which was kind of like snot.  Service was good.  My server was pleasant, polite, professional, and knowledgeable about the menu.  Prices were high.  Entrees were in the high $20s and $30s, which made Nine On Nine feel more expensive than Pittsburgh's Salt of the Earth (which seems like a more impressive restaurant).  Nine On Nine is a good restaurant.  I thought they did a good job with the foie gras and the squab.  While I was not a huge fan of all of the flavor combinations (especially with the squab), I liked a lot of what was served.  I definitely enjoyed Avenue B more and thought Salt of the Earth felt much more original, but Nine On Nine is still a decent option for an upscale dinner in Pittsburgh.  I am not sure what the parking situation is.  I think there are a few nearby paid lots.",

    "text": "Nine on Nine has fairly well executed but underwhelming food with a chaotic atmosphere and a somewhat overpriced menu. I so very wanted to be able to give them four stars but...  I ordered the Baby Spinach salad and the Lobster Mac-N-Cheese; and, my friends had the Diver Scallops. The spinach salad was a deconstructed version of what you'd typically expect. I loved the rich duck egg and salty marcona almonds; however, my salad was missing the pancetta and--I mean, come on--what's a spinach salad without bacon? My lobster mac was pretty darn good - a whole perfect claw and huge hunks of meat, creamy pasta, topped with a basil breadcrumb. (My friends appeared to be over the moon for the scallops.) And our choices from the wine menu turned out to be very tasty for $12/glass wine.  But, here's the thing: the prices on this menu had me expecting excellence when all we got was average. One of the first things our waitress emphasize when we sat down was that the restaurant wanted us to really *experience* the full expression of our meal, which I found to be a little flowery and overly inflated as compared to the food we actually received.   On top of this all, the whole restaurant was filled with meat smoke (I think their grill needs better ventilation); it was above average loud; the chairs were uncomfortable; and, there was coat check drama all night. I think every person we watched who attempted to leave hadn't been given a coat check tag, plus someone actually got their coat stolen while we were there. I think the restaurant is going for trendy and upscale, when, in reality, it comes off as inconsistent and disappointing.  Bottom line: There's plenty of other places in Pittsburgh where I'd rather spend $150+ for three people. On a Saturday night at 9pm, I should have realized why Nine on Nine was the only restaurant out of FIFTEEN we called that had open tables...",

    "text": "(11/10/2014)  Was wondering around downtown on a self-guided restaurant crawl and after having a failed experience at Sienna Mercato down the street came across Nine on Nine.  Was in Pittsburgh in 2011 and remember a good bar experience with Nine on Nine.  Place was quiet for a Monday night, music was set to someone's mid-70s playlist (just fine by us), we sat at the bar.  Space was small, plush, gilded, draped, bejeweled, with some whimsy.  One other local and what seemed like a group of family members or friends of the owners/managers were there.  The menu read as pretty pedestrian on the day we were there, so was going to skip eating...then they announced they had foie gras.  It was phenomenal, so, so glad we got to have it.  The livers were seared perfectly, had a caramelized crust that was sweet and savory a little like burnt sugar.  The garnishes or condiments complemented the unctuous foie gras well, cut some of the richness with tart fruit flavors (green apple, mandarin, dried cherries) and balance the creamy mouthfeel with contrasting texture (Marcona almonds, mache, brittle).  It was possible the dish was made on the fly, if so, genius!  Our bar experience also a highlight.  The Monday special is $8 vodka drinks all night.  For dahntahn, that's a steal.  Joseph made us fresh muddled cucumber vodka gimlets with fresh limes.  Delicious!  Atmosphere is upscale without being stuffy and sophisticated while still down to earth.  Perfect for date night, out on the town with friends or flying solo.",

We advised our server that we had show tickets and needed to leave by 7, which he agreed would not be a problem with us arriving at 6.    The menu is very limited and truly for people who are more adventurous eaters.  I advised the server that my mother needed a gluten free meal and he stated that since all meals were made to order, each item on the menu could be made gluten free.   We both ordered the pork chop.  Mine was to be medium, and hers was to be medium well and gluten-free.   After waiting 35 minutes, our meal finally arrived, but not served by our waiter who we hadn't seen in the last 30 minutes, but by someone else.   As he started to put the plate in front of me, the server finally came over and then asked which one was which.  The person carrying the food had no idea.   The server said he could tell by looking at them.   After we started eating, and got further into the meal, it was obvious by the meat temperature that he had switched our orders.   Not sure how much gluten was in the meal, but my mother had eaten some.  They had also only given us butter knives to cut the chop and since again, no sign of our server, we muddled through it.  I had handed the server my credit card when he brought our food as we only had 20 minutes to eat our meal.  Truly disappointing.  The food was nice and hot, somewhat tasty, although more BBQ sauce was certainly needed.   Service was almost non-existent.  You should only come here if you have plenty of time to enjoy a long, leisurely meal",

There were three different varieties.  My salmon pizza app was great - spicy and fresh.  We also spilt the bone marrow app.  I loved the crispy onions and sauce that was poured all over it.  The seared scallops were very tasty and had various sauces that were all very well done.  The server was great.  I'll definitely be back!",

My colleague and I ended up splitting the lobster mac n' cheese and the cobb salad. Everything was delicious! My only criticism is it is a little pricey for a lunch and I probably wouldn't have paid that much if it wasn't a work trip. if you are open to spending a little more for a lunch- try it out! The decor is charming and warm and you'll leave with a warm, full tummy too! :)",

The host staff was very friendly and accomodating (we didn't have a reservation on a Friday night) but it took no fewer than fifteen minutes to get water and another ten to get a glass of wine.    The food was . . . interesting.  I chose sweetbreads for my first course.  The dish was served with \"celery air\" (I can't make this up), blue cheese, and tomato confit.  Once I tasted it, I appreciated what the chef was doing - deconstructed buffalo wings.  But the thing was, it tasted *exactly* like buffalo wings.  Perhaps I'm missing the point of deconstructed food, but if I wanted wings, I would have gone to a place where I can get 25 of them for five bucks.  For my second course, I had a wild boar bolognese, which was truly excellent, and I highly recommend it.",

The courses are generally smaller -- which is good; you don't get stuffed like at other restaurants and instead get delicacies prepared by skilled chefs. Service is always excellent, and with the multiple course meal it often feels like food just keeps coming; you finish one course and the next one just arrives.   Only negative is I've been seated near the door and it can be really cold there; so if you have an option, sit further back!",

Rustic looking faux wood floors, trendy colors on the wall, white table cloths and an eclectic mix of dining patron rounded out the scene.  The service was upbeat and professional, without being pompous, the wine list seemed rather sparse but I am comparing it to other large metro areas where they may have more selection, however there were good choices in most categories, although I thought the prices to be a tad high.  The menu was varied and we had difficulty choosing, for starters I decided to let y cholesterol be dammed and try the veal Milanese (sweetbreads) - interesting title since it was not Milanese style except for the breading and pan frying of the product.    Sweetbreads have a very rich but blandish taste to them so they need an accompany flavor and imho a decent amount of acid to cut through the richness. Nine on Nine performed admirably on inducing flavor and cutting the satiety of the thymus gland.   First off the flavor came from the panko breading and the beurre blanc that accompanied the dish, the acid from the capers and small slices of petite grapefruit. A wonderful mix that greatly enhanced the balance and depth of the dish. Good Job  We also had the beet salad, that had greens, beets, beans and shaved fennel and a goat cheese poppy dressing. First off all it was NOT drenched in dressing - yeah. Second the combinations of flavors were good and third the beets were al dente - even better. Another smashing success.  The third dish we tried was the king trumpet mushrooms served with oriental style with a miso-chili vinaigrette.  For entrees we had the hanger steak and scallops. The flat iron steak was served on cheesy grits and had a nice Creole sauce. The dish was good but lack of vegetables seemed or color dulled the dishes presentation, plus if we had not filled up on 3 appetizers (split between 2 people, one a light eater) this dish would have been less then filling.   The scallops were served on a base of corn and chorizo (Pittsburgh seems to be in love with chorizo, there didn't seem to be a restaurant we went into that didn't have it as some component on the menu)  The presentation was good and we got 4 large sea scallops topped with ramp aioli and cilantro. While the flavor itself was good, it was not ohhhh or awww, good, but nothing really fantastic.  For desert I got to choose from a nice selections of port by the glass while my son had the strawberry sorbet, homemade nicely balanced and topped with kiwi. Very light and refreshing and not overly sweet.  Bottom Line:   Bottom Line:  Service: 5 stars Ambiance: 4.5 stars Sweetbread  Appetizer: 5 stars Salad: 5 stars Mushroom appetizer 4.5 stars Hanger Steak - 4 stars  - needed more color on plate and portion size was a little small  Scallop Entree - 4 stars - Presentation was nice but needed more flavor/ pizzazz Dessert - 4.5 stars  4.6 Stars  apps, salad, and dessert were excellent the entrees very good (small deduction because of those), service excellent, atmosphere very nice. I would recommend them, but I would also be in search of a truly stellar dining experience in Pittsburgh.",

We were presented with a modified \"party\" menu that had a cold section (choice of 2 or 3 items), warm section (2-3 items), entrees (I think there were 4-5 choices including  salmon, chicken, steak, vegetarian, and something else.  Even with this reduced menu, the kitchen staff nor bar staff could not keep up.  No one at our table was served any courses at the same time, so we we all eating separately, trying to save the evening by politely picking at the plate when it was set down.

My mother and I ordered the mussels and the kampachi sashimi for appetizers to split, I had the monkfish for my entree, and my mother had the vegetarian special (couscous salad with tofu scramble on top). We expected with ordering all of those things that we would leave with leftovers but not even close.  The bill was $91.  It would be one thing if the taste of the food was outstanding but that fell way short also. The mussels were bland and boring, the sashimi was so small in portion size that we were turned off to it from just looking at it, the monkfish was way over salted, and the couscous salad was very bitter from what seemed to be a vinegar-y dressing of some sort.

It was served with goat cheese mac & cheese.  It was delicious!  Others had the lobster mac & cheese, served with a small salad.  I have never seen chunks of lobster this big!  Even though mine was delicious - I had food envy!  I'm going back just to try this.  (Later that day another friend told me - they always order this as an appetizer for the table!!)  Another item on the table I wish I tried was the Barbecue Burger - A beautiful looking burger topped with bbq rib meat.  Looked messy and delicious.  The wait staff was fantastic.  Knowledgeable, attentive, and extremely helpful.  The lunch prices were very reasonable - sandwiches/salads $14-19ish...and entres $17-25 ish...

The duck confit salad and steak were nothing impressive. However, the service was just horrible. No one took the time to describe the menu or offer the wine tasting with each course. We sat a long time waiting on service and our plates were literally tossed on the table with no explanation of the dish. There seemed to be mass confusion amongst the wait staff and we were even served a course 2 times and had to tell the server he had the wrong table. We ordered bottled water and when finished, no one offered more and filled out glasses with tap water instead. I just cannot forgive paying $80/person and having such horrible service. We will not be returning nor recommending this place to anyone.",

It took over 10 minutes for someone to come and even give us the specials and they didn't even offer to take our drink order. By the time we did order it was 20 minutes into our visit and since we were going to the theatre we were on a time constraint. (We allowed for almost 2 hours.) so the server took our orders and then had to be reminded that we wanted drinks. Service was sub par. Now for the food. Way to pricey for what was served. I will say that my pear salad and my friends carpaccio was fantastic but that's where it ended. Our other salads were heavily dressed. The scallop dish was undercooked and unappealing. The risotto was nothing to write home about and the lobster Mac and cheese was the best of this group. Perfectly cooked, huge portions of meat but the noodles had so much sauce and it was so heavy that I could only eat about half of the portion. Overall I'd say try another restaurant in town. There are plenty to choose from.",

I have been there twice in the past couple of weeks and I have worked not far from this place forever.  Somehow, I thought that this place was farther away than it is.  Oh, idiot, idiot , idiot!   The decor and atmosphere of Nine on Nine reminds me of an intimate spot that you can go to, relax, eat, drink and be very merry!  There used to be this show back in the Nineties, called \"New York Undercover\" where one of the main character's father owned a nightclub.  Even though, the club was imaginary, somehow Nine on Nine gives me the same vibe, but in a restaurant version.  The only thing missing from this place, for me, is a live jazz trio strumming along quietly in the background.  Now let's talk about the food and service...  Love, love, love the menu!  The appetizer and salad menu isn't really that expansive, but what they offer is lovely.  Daily Ceviche, soup, roasted chicken and salmon offerings that change based upon what's fresh at the market.  On a recent visit, they offered the chicken with a blueberry barbecue sauce and fiddlehead ferns.  WHAT???  In Pittsburgh???  Come again?  My buddies ordered their home-made cream of mushroom soup and I think that they may have wanted to order seconds.  My buddies also ordered the Korean Barbeque Brisket with pickled vegetables, jalapeno peppers, Napa slaw, Sriracha mayo on a baquette.  I ordered the Crab Po' Boy with chive aioli, arugula and charred tomatoes served on a baquette.  Both sandwiches were served with Nine on Nine's Pomme Frites.  I love fresh cut fries and these were scrumpdillyicious, as well as the crabcakes!  My buddies also thoroughly enjoyed their brisket sandwiches. (They said that they would order the sandwiches again, but leave off the jalapenos.  Those jalapeno peppers kicked their azzes!)  On another recent visit, I got the same Crab Po' Boy, but I ordered the Pommes Frites with black truffle aioli.  OMG!  (Picture Martin Lawrence in the background as his character Sheneneh, saying, \"Oh mah goodneshhh!\")   Seriously, my mouth is still watering a little, RIGHT NOW!  My lunch partner ordered the Fish Tacos with blackened fish, pico de gallo, avocado, cilantro, cabbage, spice creme and jalapeno peppers.  I wish that you could hear the sounds that we were making on both occasions.  (Picture Pac Man chewing through things with that sound he makes in the background.)  Ridiculous, I know, but sometimes you just have to surrender to your base instincts.  I want to go to Nine on Nine for their Chef's Tasting.  At $90 per person, it's a little steep for a mom who pays quite a buck for their kid's high school tuition.  However, it's a treat that I want to meet sometime this year.  \"I die\" for Roasted Bone Marrow and I even have my teenage daughter Muff wrapped up in marrow love.  They have Roasted Bone Marrow here too, along with other dishes that I have swooned over in other cities!  Who knew and where have I been?  Anyway, run and don't walk to Nine on Nine.  The staff will treat you with kid gloves and it may be your next home.",

    "text": "Our waitress was wonderful and fully explained the menu and the dot format which was new to each of us. Our party of four shared a variety of interesting meals which were presented in creative ways. The salads were what I call deconstructed and were rated 50-50 at our table but did have some good bites. The entrees were delicious and included the Lamb Lollipops (3), Lobster Mac and Cheese (ample lobster cooked perfectly), Risotto (which was very creamy and tasty), and lovely prepared steak. We had room for desert and shared a Lemon Tart which was A-OK. We ate dinner prior to attending a PSO evening performance and did notice that the noise level did increase considerably as the additional diners arrived. Perhaps table cloths would help with the acoustics and ambiance  Overall it was an interesting and pleasing dining experience.",

Finally said \"Look I need to set up a table, it's going to be a wait.\" And then walked away.   It took at least 10 minutes to get a round of drinks. The bartender was awkward and annoying, trying to get us to order disgusting drinks with four different kinds of alcohol. Clearly he's catering to the wrong crowd.   Food is hit or miss--some items delicious but some really bad. Fish tacos are nasty. Gazpacho tasted like eating cold barbecue sauce.  Worst thing about it though was the dining room was full of smoke and a burnt fish smell. Combined with the slow service, the experience was pretty miserable. Our waitress was very friendly and the food presentation was ok so won't give it one star. But I'll never go back.",

This would have been fine except 45 min later we see that other guests are receiving food.  Long story short, we were told that the waitress was mistaken, and we can order now if we want.  Zero apology with a smug superior attitude gets you one star.  I will say, dessert was taken off of the bill, but really a simple \"I'm so sorry, it was my mistake\" would have been much better.

It's a \"not quite tapas\" restaurant that encourages sharing. We ordered a variety of dishes for the four of us: two house salads, roasted brussels sprouts, mashed sweet potatoes with marshmallow, salmon pizza (warning: small but spicy), risotto with cheese (salty), and steak N mashed potatoes. Ziggy was reasonably attentive, getting our dishes out in two waves and leaving us alone to enjoy our meal. We had come after the theater, but I could see that they would be conscientious about theater goers. I did think it a little superfluous for them to pipe music over the noise of conversation, and I wish they had lifted the sunscreen so we could more easily people-watch, but those are minor quibbles. Friends of ours have never tried it because of the prices, but it is worth it for a fancy meal.",

    "text": "SETTING: Dressy, Fancy, Sexy. Mood lighting? Check.   FOOD: We came for restaurant week, and believe me, we were hyped for Nine on Nine. On paper, the 3-course dinner looked beyond delicious. We could not wait to have our bellies filled with food of the gods.   But first, let me ask you a question. A bread basket is a bread basket, right? False. The complimentary focaccia bread was phenomenal. It was cut into small pieces and had some garlic, tomato slices, and probably some other fancy herbs in it. I could eat a whole loaf, no problem.  Starter: Roasted Tri Color Beets Entree: Short Rib & Ricotta Gnocchi Dessert: Creme Brulee    The starter was presented in a \"deconstructed\" fashion, with beets cut into small sizes, guanciale (cured meat), candied walnuts, a small block of brie, and drizzled miso vinaigrette. Just a heads up if you're thinking, \"Hmm vinaigrette and candied walnuts? Must be sweet\". Not this case--it actually leaned towards the savory and spicy side. I'm pretty sure the walnuts and brie had some herbs on it to made it just a little spicy. It threw me off a bit, but I still liked it because it came together well.    The Gnocchi was presented in a what looked like a jambalaya--the concoction simmering in a savory sauce. Short-ribs cut into mini chunks were mixed in with the gooey-cheesy gnocci. Topped off with arugula, smoked bleu cheese, onions. The dish was a little light on the amount of meat, but it was still quite filling and satisfying. Imagine your favorite comfort food pasta. Now, imagine it dressed up and upgraded with additional delicious ingredients. Kate Upton in jeans, now, Kate Upton in a cocktail dress. You get the idea--I didn't know something great could become something so AMAZING.   Creme Brulee unfortunately was not anything special. Good, but pretty ordinary.  SERVICE: Very professional staff and waiters for the most part. Coat check available. Our waiter was very good with explaining our dining options and offering his opinion. But the one girl who helped clear our table and refill waters just seemed like she was having the worst day ever! Never smiled, no \"you're welcome\"s when we said thank you...a little off putting. Other than that, they took good care of us.  IMPRESSIONS: More on the expensive side, but a great deal for restaurant week. Good portions. Not gonna lie, I wish I could have that bread again, right about now.",

It's an upscale place for sure and it appears to cater to the theater crowd.  The thing with theater restaurants is that if you go at 6, it's packed. If you go at 8, it's dead.   Really dead and eerily quiet because their music wasn't working.  We were the only people there, which was sort of awkward since it felt like the entire staff could hear everything we said all night.    What pulled up the star rating was the Lobster Mac-N-Cheese.  Completely worth the $16!  Creamy and flavorful with a hint of herbs (which also make it look extra good).  Big chunks of lobster and bread crumbs on the top rounded it out nicely.  Overall, I just didn't get a warm and fuzzy feeling from this place, despite the good food.   I would describe it more as stuffy and uppity than warm and inviting.   I might try it again in the dining room since the food was good, but then again, maybe not.",

We had to remind the server a couple of times about our drinks and eventually went up to the bartender to try to get them.  We barely made it to the show in time due to the terrible service.  The server was also very unfriendly and just seemed pretty unhappy with his job, although I do think he had too many tables to cover. We finally got our drinks but they were not very good and clearly just thrown together. The food was ok but not impressive.  The menu was very confusing with the appetizer sized things mixed in with the entree sized things.  I ordered the duck confit ravioli, which was one of the more expensive options so I figured it would be pretty sizable but even that was pretty small for the price. It was literally just one piece of ravioli, though a pretty large ravioli.  The lobster mac n cheese my friend ordered seemed to be one of the more appropriately sized entrees. The ambiance is also weird with an odd mix of different types of decor so I couldn't tell what kind of look they were really going for.",

    "text": "Nine on Nine, the place that makes us say, 'why don't we eat here more often?' every time we visit.  Honestly, I think Nine on Nine gets overlooked far too frequently in the downtown restaurant scene. It's been around longer, and perhaps it's not as flashy as some of the newer spots, but their food and wine games are always so very on point, and the service cannot be beat.  We most recently stopped in for their New Year's Eve special dinner. Our old NYE standby for the past decade closed down, and we were panicked, trying to find a replacement. Well, we found it, and I am confident that we will return next year as well.  Even though the restaurant typically isn't open on Sundays, they prepared an amazing limited menu for NYE. Basically, we read the menu online, thought, 'yes all of those things look GREAT' and made reservations, not really thinking through the 'we are going to have to narrow this stuff down once we're actually at dinner' part of it.  Suffice to say, we were quite glad our waiter Ziggy brought us some sparkling rose to enjoy while we spent ages trying to make our selections for the three-course meal.  Every bite was perfect, start to finish. The meal started with a flavorful amuse-bouche of pickled beets, candied walnuts, and feta cheese. We also enjoyed some of their super-fresh and soft bread (served with whipped butter with salt crystals on top mmmmm) while waiting for the first course.  What I loved about the three-course meal was that the portion sizes were perfect for the first part of a 'night out.' Meaning, definitely enough to be filling, but not enough you felt too stuffed to continue on your evening's adventures, or had to carry a takeout box for the remaining hours of the evening. It was Just Right.  We enjoyed shrimp bisque (cold weather Heaven!), lobster mac n cheese (with GIGANTIC chunks of lobster), tender and juicy scallops, a steak that was so tender you hardly needed a knife (yet it had the perfect sear on all sides), and finished the evening off with decadent pear cheesecake and a chocolate cake. YUM.  So much care and attention went into each of these dishes and the pairings of the accompaniments on each plate. It's a wonderful dilemma when you have to really concentrate to narrow down the options on even a limited menu, because each looks more amazing than the last.  They also have a very well-curated wine list, with lots of by-the-glass options as well as by-the-bottle. They have a great selection of liquors, after-dinner-bevvies, and craft cocktails as well. (I always seem to fall for their chocolate desserts, and they have Angel's Envy Bourbon on hand, which is the best chocolate accompaniment.)  During their regular hours, they have a really terrific cheese and charcuterie board. And the servers are always attentive, helpful, and friendly. Prices are reasonable, especially given their location. And if you're coming in before a show, they will do their best to get you in, fed, and out well before the curtain goes up.   It's time we moved Nine on Nine from our 'why don't we come here all the time?' spot to our 'I'm glad we go here all the time' spot. I hope you will give it a shot to see if it can be yours, too.",

We enjoyed the menu style which was a bit different from the typical layout. You could mix and match different items (they were not split up into appetizers, salads/soups, entrees etc), and there is a section called \"Shareables\". We ordered the lamb chops and brussel sprouts for our starters- fabulous. Filet mignon tournedos for mains, and the white chocolate cheesecake dessert. Our server, Ziggy, was especially helpful and we enjoyed chatting with him! He made our experience all the more pleasant. Overall a delightful meal in a cozy atmosphere, in the heart of downtown. Will be back again!",

Filet mignon with Rosemary potatoes (Yukon) is a nice meal as well. In fact I think nice is too tame to describe how delectable it really is. Mouth-watering filet that melts in the mouth as it should lending to flavorful potatoes that push the \"omg this food\" euphoria to the edge.",

Nice flavor, enough lobster and piping hot. For his entree my friend ordered the filet tournedos which he enjoyed. I ordered the pounded tenderloin - loved it! Perfectly cooked, tender with crispy edges. We also shared the brussel sprouts w lemon aioli. They were fine, I'm not a huge lover of brussel sprouts but they were edible. We shared the chocolate mousse dessert - yum! And the pear cheesecake - this was just ok, couldn't taste any pear but it was beautifully presented. I think adding some poached pears on the side may help if the pear can't be added to the cheesecake itself. Overall, good experience, nice and clean inside, good service, noise level was low (thank goodness!). I would return for another visit.",

The chefs seem passionate about what they are doing.  That said, i feel like front of house lets them down. We had an awkward dance with the hostess about our reservation. That kind of \"I don't see their reservation so let's all gather around the screen with our backs to them and not say anything\" thing. Waitstaff, while very nice and warm either were over-whelmed or forgetful. Timing of dishes was totally wonky. Wine glasses stay empty a bit too long including after our entree arrived. Sell me more wine. I'll buy it! (Who are these restaurant managers who don't flip out when they see empty wine glasses on tables?)  Still, not a bad place to dine if you happen to be in Pittsburg. The actual food and if you can score a seat by the window make up for the somewhat casual and wonky service.",

    "text": "I made reservations at Nine on Nine for 4 of us a few weeks ago for this past Saturday.  I received a phone call the day before confirming our reservation and asking about any allergies or if we had to be out by a certain time.  Our reservations were at 5pm with the need to leave by 6:30 due to going to a 7p show, with no allergies.    The four of us arrived early and were promptly seated.  Our waiter came and the first question - do you need separate checks.  Yes - PERFECT.  Thank you so much for asking, we would have requested it, so thank you.  Move on through appetizers and dinner.  All bland.  I was so disappointed with my food.  We all were.  Bland and unappetizing.  Then it was 630.  We had requested from our waiting to get us our checks, due to having to leave at 630 (we also reminded him at the beginning of service).  We got an eye roll, a huff, and said alright.  15 minutes later we received our checks - all were wrong, except one  Then he continued to bring it back - wrong.  He started to get a big belligerent with us.  Made someone else bring the checks to us, because he was dealing with others.  (They were NOT that busy, maybe half the seats were filled, if that).    After his attitude, the bland food, and the fact that every single staff member made us feel like pawn scum.  We will not return.  Nine on Nine needs to realize - there are FAR better restaurants in town.  They were lucky to have our business, but they've also lost our business.    I typically give restaurants a couple chances - especially if the first chance is not good.  However, I won't waste my time, ever again.",

    "text": "I'll start by saying I'm not a regular fine-diner, per se, so my opinion may be due to that factor. My family and I went here for a belated Christmas celebration before a show at the Benedum, which is just a few blocks away. We knew from perusing the menu online that they served mostly small plates, so between the six of us, we shared two appetizers (papas fritas and braised brussels) and all ordered our food with various wines, beers, and martinis. The drink bill alone was quite pricey, but I guess that's expected at a fancier place.   I got the blackened salmon and it was quite good, actually. It came with some sort of carrot and sweet potato mash, I think honey was also involved. My fiancee got the beef tip ravioli and to our surprise, it was one large ravioli like we'd never seen before. He also enjoyed it, but it came with nothing but some green garnish and the one big ravioli wasn't what he was expecting. My dad got the scallops and Mexican street corn. The scallops were wrapped in chicken skin and there were just two. They were a decent size so that you had to cut them, and the chicken skin made doing so hard. The street corn was okay but since corn on the cob is typically seasonal, I was surprised they served that in December. He said he could tell it wasn't fresh. My mom got the Amish chicken meal and enjoyed it. My brother and sister-in-law both got the sirloin tornados. They came with two small mounds of mashed potatoes. My sister-in-law liked it well enough but my brother said they were nothing to rave about. He was also done with his entire plate before most of us were even half done, so he was clearly wanting more. In general, I didn't really like not knowing what side, if any, came with the meals. The carrot/sweet potato medley was a surprise and luckily, I like both. My mom's came with asparagus, but none of this is clearly listed on the menu so you don't really know what to expect.   When we ordered, the waitress did kind of hint that we should've ordered more food, asking a few separate times if we wanted any other appetizers or side salads. Though I think we all would have liked more food, we knew we weren't going to get much more for another $10 a pop. The final tab was pretty high in comparison to other nice establishments we've gone to for special occasions where we left feeling more satisfied.   The wait staff was very nice and accommodating and the place itself had a pleasant atmosphere, though it was a bit dark to see the menu for my parents haha. All in all, we were mostly satisfied with the quality of the food itself but some aspects of the meals were unknown when we ordered and nothing was amazing or even really above average.  Its not the kind of place to go in a large group for dinner, in my opinion. Better for a night cap or something along those lines, if you're into that sort of thing.",

It was so cozy, comfortable, and cute. The bartenders were absolutely wonderful and inviting. I ordered a tonic water with lemon. And for my meal, I ordered the amazing Lobster Mac and Cheese. It was soooo good!!!! And I am so mad that I cannot have it again from there. The portion size was very nice, along with the richness of the cheese and lumpy lobster will definitely fill you up. For dessert I order the Berry Cream Cake. Again, ahhhhmazing! I was told they are trying to find a new location But as of now, there's no news regarding that. I do hope they open again soon and bring back their amazing lobster mac and cheese, cozy environment, and delightful service! This is a place that will be greatly missed.",

    "text": "Nine on nine is a five star restaurant, hands down!  We had tickets to see the Nutcracker, so when looking for an upscale restaurant to eat at before hand, Nine on Nine seemed to be the place to go. The location was key, only about a block away from the theatre. I will say that OpenTable did not show open reservations for 5PM, but when I called the restaurant directly the hostess was extremely kind and helpful, and even asked if anyone had any food allergies before hand.   Upon arriving at 5PM, the restaurant was super empty. Within 15-20 minutes that changed, almost every table was full! I'm glad we arrived early because we didn't want to rush dinner to get to our show.   Our waiter, JP, was amazing. Not only was he attentive, he was funny, and really made our whole night. He was very knowledgeable of the menu, gave great recommendations- and even had the chef change up the scallop preparation for me. When we come back, which we will, I would be extremely happy if we had him take care of our table again.   To start, you receive complementary bread which comes with somewhat of a \"coffee flavored\" butter.   For our entrees we ordered the bone marrow, and seared scallops. To share, the roasted brussel sprouts. Everything was cooked perfectly, and beautifully prepared.   Our service was great, food was unreal. The space itself was beautiful, right on the corner of 9th where people watching was fun to say the least!   I would highly recommend this restaurant! And JP as your waiter!",

    "text": "We made a reservation for Nine on Nine during Pittsburgh's Restaurant Week. We were seated right by the window which was nice, as we had a perfect view of Penn Avenue while we ate.   We had already examined the Restaurant Week menu before we got there, so we already knew what it was that we wanted to order.  We did go with choices from said menu.  Initially I didn't think anything of it, but when the table behind us was seated an entire explanation of different wines pairings and prices were mentioned to them about that menu. That kind of annoyed me, apparently our waitress didn't feel like we were worthy customers or that we needed to know any of this information. An appetizer and entree and dessert is a fantastic deal at $35 during restaurant week. It's also a great way to try out a place you haven't yet been to and see how you like the food or their preparation of meals.  I started with the gazpacho. I really enjoyed it, the chef went a little heavy handed with the parmesan espuma, but there was more crab in it than I expected and it was a very good starter dish. My black halibut was cooked to absolute perfection. A nice crispy exterior and a totally flaky tender inside. The Forbidden Rice was a little different than I had previously tried while living in Hawaii, but it does have that rich nutty flavor and was a perfect accompaniment to the halibut. My husband's short rib dish was so tender you could cut it with a butter knife and he loved the addition of the cherries in the sauce that went with it. We ended it off with the blueberry pound cake dessert. The flavor was there, but it definitely would have benefited from being served at room temperature instead of cold like it was.  Overall the food here was very good. I will say the service could be improved. A very awkward moment was when one of the servers came by to clear a couple empty dishes off our table. She literally stood there and waited for me to finish the last two bites of my dessert and then snatched the plate off the table.",

Our pre-show (Hamilton, which deserves at least 6 stars) dinner for 4 was fine, although the service was slow enough to create a little anxiety. Interestingly none of us ordered an entree, choosing soup, lobster Mac and cheese, and sliders instead. All of the food was good. Our choices point out how truly odd the menu is. There are the normal soup, salad, and appetizer items, but the entrees range from a single moderately priced pasta to pricey seafood and steaks, but also beef sliders and fish tacos. There's a pretty good free bread service. What's the theme? What will bring us back? But then we do return.",

    "text": "Restaurants are about the dining experience. This place has great food, but awful service. I mean like terribly awful unacceptable service. Actually worse than that.   So let's talk dining experience. I suspect the chef is pretty skilled and creative.  The servers are trained to be professional, but they are SEVERELY understaffed and generally inept.   We came at 7 pm. Place was about 2/3 full.  It was about 20 minutes to place our drink orders. About 1/3 of the drinks came out about 30 minutes later. My drink was wrong, so I sent it back. About half an hour later, I reminded our server my drink had not come yet. Then about 45 minutes after that, I reminded the manager my drink had not come yet. And that was about an hour after we ordered wine, which had not arrived yet. Eventually the wrong wine arrived, which they took back but still charged us for, and then ran out of the wine we ordered.   So let's talk food.  They ran out of almost everything during ordering. Tried to order the tasting menu, but were told not enough food for our table. So everyone had to compromise what they ordered, because kitchen was out of food, early on a Saturday night, only being partially full.  WTF!  Who does the buying here?    So apps come out. Delicious. Like really good. Everything delicious but for the fois gras. It is terrible.  Awful, but for the pistachios and sauce.  Tastes like bad bread.  Never had anything like this before. Whoever made this should go back to their day job as a plumber.   But let's talk oysters.  Not properly chilled, but the red stuff that came with them was absolutely out of this world. Like finely cubed apples in some deep red vinegary sauce. Outstanding. Phenomenal!   Charcuterie. Really really good. Like great. Seriously well thought out.   Ceviche:  good. Not the best, but solid.   Salmon pizza. Not good. Basically toast points with balsamic vinegar and a hunk of smoked salmon.  Bone marrow: Bleh. Olives: mushy, soft and bleh. Heirloom tomatoes come with popcorn. Really weird but good. Caesar salad presentation super creative and tasty.   Main entrees: all properly cook, tasty, and creative. 4+ stars food only. Food came out in weird intervals, and staff had no clue who ordered what, but after a round of musical plates, we all got our food.  Still waiting for wine we ordered about an hour ago, after 2-3 reminders.   3+ hours into dinner, messed up drink orders, messed up app orders, messed up entree orders, no one apologizes or even offers free dessert. Not even a free drink that took 1.5 hours to come. But, nonetheless, we order dessert. They run out of most during the ordering. So we all compromise. Most just bleh. Not really even good. Skip dessert. Oh, btw, decaf coffee really good.   As we leave almost 4 hours after coming in, not a single apology for the terrible service.   Dining is an experience; food and service. Food really good here, but service is less than dismal. I have never given a 1 star review, but this place almost deserves it. Food almost 5 Star, Service about a minus 15. I would not come here if you seek a pleasant dining experience.",

What was really dissapointing was the quality of the food. I came about 5 or 5:15 so really like the first seating. All the food was served with fried chips - I have no idea why. My husband and I ordered the Nine Hummus Trio, The salmon Pizza, ceviche, and baked zuchini eggplant. I liked the Hummus but good hummus isn't enough to come back to a place. Just underwhelming food. The ambiance was very nice, but not a must visit    :-(",

Placed right in the heart of the cultural district on Penn Ave, the setting is perfect. When you walk in, you're greeted by beautiful ambiance (and complimentary coat check -- yes please!)   Our server was one of the best I've ever had, and really contributed to the overall experience. He was sure to make me feel special for my birthday and even gave me a free martini (that I didn't order!) on the house. He was knowledgeable about the menu and the chefs.   The food. Oh the food. Some of the best I've ever had. We started with a cheese and charcuterie board that was amazing. We then shared the green curry mussels and the lamb lollipops. Everything was cooked to perfection with amazing, unique flavors. Finally, we ended the night with dessert. They have a French Pastry chef in house. We were presented with a tray and thorough explanation of all our options. Almost every dessert featured hazelnut which I wasn't crazy about, but they were still delectable! I wish I could even remember what they were called, but we pointed to the tray and said give me that one! So the pictures will have to do justice.   Whether a special occasion or just wanting to treat yourself, this place is an experience I'd never turn down!",

We didn't have a reservation but was able to get seated rather quickly. The restaurant itself was okay, but nothing special. The two dishes I ordered (beet salad & lamb shoulder) were both good, however I was surprised how long it took for the dishes to come out. The first dish took awhile to come out, then the main dish took 3x longer! Which I found odd, because the restaurant wasn't that busy either.   Overall, my experience here was just okay. It was horrible, but it wasn't that memorable either.",

I ordered the filet and my friend ordered the lamb chops. We ordered the asparagus and Brussel sprouts as side dishes. Everything arrived hot and it was probably the most tender filet I've ever had albeit very small. My friend enjoyed her lamb chops as well.   The prices are steep for the portion sizes, but the food was very good. Don't order mixed drinks. I ordered a Malibu and sprite and my friend a crown and coke. We could barely detect any alcohol in our drinks. Order wine or a shot. Those reasons are why I couldn't give five stars, but still very good food.",

    "text": "We like to have dinner before we see shows at the Benedum so I'm always looking for new places to go. Nine on Nine was my choice this time.   I made reservations about a week beforehand. I thought it was great that they called the day before to check our reservation and ask about dietary restrictions. I told them I am gluten free. She also asked if it was a special occasion and I said we had a birthday. She asked if they could do a candle on the dessert and I said yes. When we arrived it was like we had never spoken. They did not know about my diet restrictions or offer any input and did not remember the birthday.   It wasn't a big deal, as I know what I can and can't eat, I just don't know why they waste time calling and asking. I thought it was an amazing gesture but it turned out to be disappointing.  Upon arrival we were seated promptly and given menus. They have a \"star system\" so our waiter explained that 1 star is a small portion and 2 is medium, 3 is a large shareable portion. We ordered seared scallops which had 3 stars and filet which was also a 3. The beef was enough for 2 but we got 3 Scallops total for the other entree. Three scallops is hardly a \"shareable\" portion. We had to send the filet back as it was overcooked and it took a bit before it came back out. The food was delicious but skimpy. They are out of a LOT of wine and didnt have what we wanted. They substituted with a \"comparable\" bottle which was sub par and over priced as I can buy the same wine online for $13.99 and we were charged $40 for it.  That being said...our waiter was nice although he got over seated toward the end of our meal and forgot a bunch of things which we had to ask for several times.   Too bad that it's so overpriced and understaffed because the food was pretty amazing.   I don't think we will be going back.",

Instead of grouping items by their size, they're grouped by protein, with an inconsistent \"dot system\" to classify how large or small a dish is. Some items on the menu didn't even have these stupid dots, so I suppose we're supposed to just assume based on price. My lobster mac and cheese was good, but I was disappointed that it wasn't available as a full-sized entree.  It was clear that our server had too many tables, as there were long stretches where we wouldn't see him. I would have ordered a second round of oysters had he returned to the table within any kind if reasonable time, but he didn't, and it seemed to be a sign that we should just continue on with the rest of what we'd already ordered.  My husband had the duck \"ravioli\" which is definitely not plural. They really need to call it a \"raviolo,\" because there was just one giant one. It's not what I would have considered a \"three-dot\" full-sized entree.  I would call the overall experience \"meh.\" Weird atmosphere, stupid menu format, so-so service, but the food was decent.",

First of all, it's one of \"those\" places in which the place is empty and you're asked if you have a reservation.  Ok, that's not the problem.  The problem is when they hesitate (long pregnant pause hesitate) and say \"I'll see what we can do\".  Really?  The place is virtually empty.  Get off your high horse (and, furthermore, it remains nearly empty the entire hour or more we're there).  Our host points out 3 tables for which we have a choice.  Ok.  Fine.  The place has nice enough ambiance.  The menu is confusing.  The restaurant seems to have an identity problem.  If you're a Tapas place, then just say so.  We notice the offerings and prices and are thinking to ourselves, \"I bet this is a Tapas place\".  We ask our server and get a round-a-bout answer that yes, we can share items.  Ok.  The problem with this is that there really aren't all that many vegetable items listed.  I really don't want a meal of all protein.  And mac-n-cheese does not count as a veggie.  We end up ordering a concoction of Caesar salad (which was quite tasty) for our vegetable.  (Hey, management!  Brussel sprouts, asparagus, green beans would have been nice.)  Then there was some confusion about what we ordered.  We ordered duck which had marrow listed with it, fish tacos, and fried chips with three different spreads.  When I asked what marrow was when ordering the duck, our server thought I wanted to order the marrow dish, as well. He was nice enough to serve it anyway and deduct it from our bill.  That was generous of him.  And, the marrow (of which I had never had), was quite good.  The duck was ok, as were the fish tacos, but not spectacular.  I knew the bill would be high even minus the marrow being deducted anytime you order dishes separately and we did have 4 glasses of wine between us.  I'm not so aggravated by the price as much as the execution and offerings were not really all that worthy of that price.  Bottom line, the wine selection was good, the food was good and presentation was above par, the ambiance was relaxing but a notch above casual, and they need more vegetable selections.",

The Swiss chard with the scallops is a great pairing and the sweet potato puree is like desert with your dinner. the steak dish has a blue cheese hash that is ridiculously flavorful and pairs perfectly with the steak. Service was fantastic. Ali rocks. And cam from the kitchen came out to provide a little personal touch, along with JP. Cool drink selections as well. Very happy with our overall night and definitely suggest it for a romantic night out",

    "text": "My family and I had the chef's tasting menu here, which consisted of eight courses.   The decor was clean and modern, and the service was very good. It was nice that the executive chef or the pastry chef personally came out to present every dish of the tasting menu to us.  Generally, the food was always good and the presentation was nice, though there was some variation in quality between courses. Portion sizes were larger than expected. By the time we were served the meat course, we were all starting to get uncomfortably full. So pace yourself and don't eat too much bread (though the bread assortment is quite good).  Comments on the specific courses: - The soup was poured tableside. Tasted like a more refined, less salty and fatty version of a french onion soup. The best part was actually the simplicity of the fresh mushrooms and spring vegetables. - Roasted bone marrow was good, but not great. It wasn't as wonderfully fatty as I wanted it to be. The onion marmalade made the dish for me, adding a much-needed sweetness to balance out everything. - The chef shaved fresh white truffle over the risotto tableside. I really liked this course. The risotto was creamy with a deep parmesan and truffle flavor. It was also cooked perfectly. Only comment is that it was a tad too salty.  - The scallops were beautifully seared. I thought that the pea puree was a bit sweet. I actually preferred to eat the scallop by itself. - Palate cleanser featured edible flowers. Very interesting and unique. The bitterness of the flowers were balanced nicely with the sweetness of the foam and the tapioca crumbles. Job well done in terms of successfully cleansing our palates. - Duck was very good and seasoned well. Skin was crispy and the ratio of meat to fat was nice. I loved the beets and quinoa accompaniments as well. - Cheese course: Three different cheeses served with a jam, macadamia nuts, and crisp toast. My favorite was the truffled asiago. - Dessert was indian spiced donuts served with some sort of berry/rose sauce. The donuts were not sweet at all and had a great texture, perfectly fried. It paired nicely with the sweetness of the sauce. I thought that the presentation sort of lacked on this one since they used the same bowl and set-up as that of the soup.  So my family and I had a good meal here. There were some interesting combinations of flavors, some that worked for me and some that didn't. But I liked the fact that the chef wasn't afraid to take some risks.",

    "text": "It appears to be an okay restaurant, but nothing special and seemingly not worth the price.  I sat at the bar for my first visit and thankfully Nine On Nine has a good happy hour with half price food from the bar menu as well as discounted wine and drinks.  The wine list is pretty good and lots of choices by the glass so that's a positive.  The cocktails didn't look very exciting so I didn't try any cocktails.  As for food, thankfully I went for half price happy hour dishes because neither the mussels nor the risotto I ordered was would have been worth the full prices of $16 and $14, respectively.  Don't get me wrong, there were a huge number of mussels in the bowl, but they were overcooked and a bit stringy, some hadn't been cleaned properly and were grainy, and the sauce (which is one of my favorite parts of a good mussel dish) didn't add much flavor other than when it soaked into one of the 6 or 7 tiny little crouton-sized pieces of bread that were sprinkled on top of the dish.  The mushroom risotto was fine but nothing special - slightly too al dente and missing salt or something so it just didn't have much flavor.  At $8 and $7 per plate I've had a lot worse, but these dishes definitely weren't worth their full menu prices.  Oh, and the ceviche of the day - which I did not get - was tilapia.  I've rarely ever seen that before - nothing like a cheap, typically muddy tasting fish for a good ceviche...  I may go back and order off the full menu because I can't argue with some nicely chosen wines by the glass for $6 during happy hour - and a lot of people seem to like the food here - but the next visit will confirm whether it's worth ever going back after that.  The prices aren't cheap so my expectations are high and food on my first visit didn't come close to meeting them.",

I ate at the bar (Bar Nine) but the same menu was being served on both sides of the wall.   The bartenders were a little slow (for a Tuesday night with .05 patrons), but I'm a total 'give me my drink now!' snot.  One bartender was being trained and went looking for the Malbec in the white wine fridge.  Food.  I had a wonderful yet simple roasted beet salad with just the right amount of Point Reyes cheese and honey-lavendar dressing.  The vinegarette pulled me in--it wasn't sweet and perfectly complimented the other flavors in the salad.  I totally loved my little simple balanced salad.    Lobster mac n' cheese.  Creamy, delish but the topping wasn't quite right.  Big old hunks o' lobster.  I've never really been a fan of lobster mixed into dishes and I'm probably the only person who picks the hunks of lobster OUT of their mac n' cheese.  Don't worry...I ate some...just not all!! It was good.  I wish I had someone with me to share the charcuterie.",

It was not too olive juicy...the house bread was an assortment and yummy!  next up the house salad with white balsamic vinigrette dressing which was excellent.  The dressing always makes the salad and this dressing was very good.  Next course was the lobster Mac and cheese which was so rich and really to die for...loved the lobster flavoring and how the macaroni were shells...oh so delicious.  For the main course I ordered the Bronzino...oh that white flakey fish was perfection....it came with cauliflower which I didn't even know I liked!  It goes to show veggies are delicious when properly prepared.  My hubs ordered the scallops and loved them.  We finished with the choc cake and it was average...that was the only part of the meal I wasn't that in to....and I'm I big dessert fan.  Very good experience and good food!",

Yes, the prices are a bit steep but much better than their dinner menu.   I had a completely satisfying plate of fish tacos that I will definitely go back for. So far they are the best fish tacos I've had in the Burgh (beating out Penn Ave Fish Co and Kaya). The fish was seasoned and grilled perfectly and not overwhelmed by the cabbage and sauce. My only proverbial beef with all of the fish tacos I've tasted  in this city is that they come in a flour tortilla. Maybe it's due to the lack of Latin Americans in the area but tacos come on corn tortillas people!  Regardless, I'll definitely check this place out again. My waitress was very friendly and accommodating, service was quick and their lunch menu seems ever-changing. Stop by if you're in the area.",

I chose a very delicious apple margarita. My guest chose a gin and tonic.  We also shared a chicken flatbread pizza.  In addition to the chicken, there also appeared to be fig on the pizza. The crust, however, was quite flaky and easily broke apart.  Next time, however, I will forgo the appetizer and stick with a beverage.

I had the Barramundi $28 that came on a bed of potato risotto, green beans and was garnished with \"basil caviar\" which was made using some food science trickery. The fish was seared with a nice curst yet soft and flakey inside, the potatoes were just right, firm and packed with a stubble flavor. The basil caviar was a fun and flavorful garnish. My coworker had the salmon, served with seared bock choy,  green beans and a mushroom corn sauce.

We were pleasantly surprised by our greeting and the way that we were accommodated and seated 30 minutes early. During our brief wait in the lounge we ordered  drinks but were seated before the drinks were served. We were given a nice quiet corner table. From that point the service went down hill. The table was not set up by not having complete silverware or water. Our server tried to deliver our drinks to a neighboring table. We did get water after the server made the attempt to deliver the drinks, then got our drinks after the server introduction. We had to ask for silverware, bread and water refills. Additionally, our friendly server wasn't very familiar with the menu. That being said, our meals were terrific. We had the pear salad, filet medallions, sliders, and lobster mac. All good as well as the terrific mixed drinks at a reasonable price. This place could be fantastic with extensive staff training. I think that the proprietor should spend less time socializing and more time training. He claims that some think he walks on water, but him people won't learn his skills by osmosis.",

NoN has a formal atmosphere and an impressive looking menu, but it failed to deliver in both service and in preparation and flavor.  We had spotty service, with attention, followed by long gaps of inattention.  I won't go into detail, but it took too long for each part of our order to be taken, too long with empty glasses on the table, too long to deliver bread (like 45 min after arriving), drinks delivered and dirty plates not removed (from a small table).    If you're going to be this formal, even bordering on stuffy, then you're going to have to hold up tour end of the bargain.  NoN did not.  Appetizer of octopus salad:   Large oblong plate, with salad on one half, and a streak of sauce on the other half.  Sauce was weakly flavored, and the octopus grilled to dryness.  Unremarkable. The other salad was a Beet salad. Again fussy looking, but nobody commented that it was actually good tasting.  Then the mains. Pork Osso Bucco described as \"maple root vegetables, porter reduction, blackberry, corn shoots\" The pork was tender, but over salted, without any other contrasting notes.  The root vegetables were roasted, and served with the now ubiquitous roasted kale (or was it brussels greens, I couldn't tell).  No contrasting flavors, no maple, blackberry, etc.  just umami roasted veg.  Now the truly telling dish.  The \"Daily Vegetarian Offering.\"  A plate with rice and chick-pea mini \"burger patties\" that were flavorless and dried out, with just a sprinkling of greens and small potatoes for garnish.  Another nondescript sauce.  The waiter said it was \"really good.\"  It was not.  This is always such a disappointment.  If you can't cook vegetables, just say so.  If it's too hard to not fall back on something with \"short rib\" in the name, then just fess up.  We understand.  Not like there aren't entire cuisines that are almost entirely vegetarian with absolutely mind-blowing flavor combinations and inventiveness.  We'll just order another salad for the main, and save it for a trip to any of a dozen local Thai, Indian or Vietnamese restaurants that know how great a veg dish can be.  Or, while we're at it, any one of a dozen or so new entrants to the local scene that really care about the food their serving, even the \"vegetables\".  Friends don't let friends take out-of-towners to NoN.  Pittsburgh does so much better elsewhere.",

    "text": "I used to love it here.  I don't know when they decided to downgrade their service, and quality, but it showssss.   This place has become the high priced, low quality dinner theater restaurant, in my eyes.  Don't get me wrong, I love their happy hour.  Half priced selected appetizers are now the only reason why I would stop here to eat.  My hubby and I came for dinner, and basically flushed $200 down the drain.  Everything was bland, and if it wasn't bland it was overly salty.  The wine list made us laugh because they had a $42 bottle of Pinot and then it jumped to $700 bottle of Pinot.  Nothing in between.  It was just bad.  Do yourself a favor and hit up their happy hour for the truffled mac and cheese.  It is the same portion, as if you would order it for a sit down dinner, and the slashed price feels better going down.",

    "text": "Disillusioned.  The food while good, but tried to do too much with the palate.  I had the Monte Cristo and while I applaud the use of brioche to make a turkey sandwich...I really wish they wouldn't have drizzled the syrup all over it.  At that point either make it an open-faced item or keep the drizzle so it can be eating without sticky fingers.  The ambiance was pretty nice, I did enjoy the decor.  The service was a little overflowing in the repressed attitude department.  We all have bad days or rough patches...but seriously...when your body language clearly establish we're not worth your time it REALLY detracts from the eating experience.  In general, I find it really uneasy when the waiter (or waitress) roll their eyes if the entire party chooses to drink water ... newsflash it's just being healthy and not necessarily cheap...so don't act like \"there goes your tip.\"  I probably wouldn't go back unless it was with a group of friends that were fans of the place.  If I did go back, it would give me a chance to taste something different, but I would rather spend my money elsewhere.  Maybe it'll be better next time.",

    "text": "My husband and I stopped here last night before a movie at the Harris Theatre.  We sat in the bar, and got good service--although we were one of two parties when we arrived.  We each had a glass of wine and shared some risotto (amazing!) and some pizza (just ok).  It's been commented on before, but the portion sizes are quite small for the price here--I get that it's not the Golden Corral, but I didn't feel satisfied when we left, and that rarely happens even when I'm just eating \"bar food.\"  I would probably come back for drinks (they have a decent wine list too), but not for a full meal, especially with so many other great options in the same area.",

Average. The formerly heavenly black tuffle aioli? Where was the truffle? The service? Attitude.   Its been months since I've been here...the gang and I have been gravitating to Market Square and the crazy selection of fantastic dining there. I think its going to be a long while before giving Nine on Nine a try again. Why settle for average when there are so many outstanding options available downtown?! Nine on Nine, you can do better!",

    "text": "Once upon a midnight dreary while we wandered weak and weary...we sought refuge in this little restaurant in hopes to fill our rumbling tummies.   Service: It was around 8pm on a Tuesday with a five minute wait, not bad. The staff was pleasant and the waitress was helpful and very soft spoken, which i loved (I hate it when people shout menus at me). She was extremely attentive and friendly.   Food: We started off with the bone marrow. It was amazing! The perfectly baked bread, the roasted bone marrow, along with the garlic green sauce thing... amazing! I would go back just for bone marrow. It was definitely the highlight of the meal. For entrees we had the scallop and squab which were cooked to perfection. The portion size was just enough, we weren't overly stuffed and we weren't hungry for more (I could've gone for more bone marrow though=). For dessert we had the pineapple panna cotta. The texture was spot on and the bits of pineapple chunks combo was wonderful.  What wasn't so wonderful was the caramelized bits of what I believed to be tamarind. It had a good texture but it had a burnt bitter after taste which I did not enjoy.   I will definitely be back.",

The ambiance was wonderful, low lightly, quiet, and romantic.  We started by ordering drinks from their \"prohibition\" drink selection.  Very tasty.  One was a mint drink (sadly don't remember the names) and the other a more creamy drink.  Both delicious.  Moved on to cocktails and they were well made.  I'm fairly picky with my alcoholic beverages and I was pleased here. Our waiter was on the new side, and seemed a little timid.  He didn't explain anything on the menu, he asked if we had questions though.  He was kind, but you could tell he was new.  We ordered the tasting menu, everything was elegant, and I had never tried a few things on this menu...such as bone marrow, foie gras,etc.  I enjoyed them all.  Only qualm was I needed the waiter to remind me what each course was because they were so intricately prepared I forgot the details.   I would definitely go back again.  Cheers!",

    "text": "In followup to Courtney, Nine on Nine owner's reply to my posted review. Here is additional commentary on the evening. As for returning my entree: Myself and my wife were six of eight at our table that ordered the Hanger Steak entree. My wife did indeed return the cold entree to the server. It was not replaced, but returned to the table after being placed under the broiler to be heated. This just made the meat more \"over-done\". After the others in the group saw this, they just kept their entrees, including myself. In fact, most chuckled at another disappointment. Since my review, I talked to other diners in our group seated at another table and their salads were all served undressed as well. Evidently, their server brought dressing to their table, but none was offered to ours? Note: At no time during the entire dinner did our server's ask anyone as to how their dinner was tasting. At no time did a Manager approach our table to ask how things were going. As for the comment about dessert, and why not complain?  At this point the meal was a disaster, and when the failed dessert arrived, everyone was so unhappy, we were just wanting to exit the closest door. Again, almost everyone at our table ordered the Creme Brule, and they all were not eaten. Did anyone notice this on your team?? Yes, you are correct that I we did not complain profusely, my group said to just get over it and not to let a crappy meal ruin our fabulous 5 day trip to Pittsburgh. My wife asked me to not make a scene, but I was so unhappy, I did abruptly confront the manager on the way out.  As I would want others to post their disappointment to let me know their bad experiences, I posted my bad experience. As an additional followup: I noticed in another posted Yelp review of your restaurant, that your Chef did indeed leave to open his own place: Meat and Potatoes. Interesting enough, we dined their two night's previously, and had a wonderful meal with great service. We were indeed asked many times how things were going throughout the night.  Attached below is my original post:  Horrible Experience! Stay away! You have been Warned!! Oh My God, is this place terrible. Did they lose there chef? If not, they need too. Well, we arrived, a pre-set event with 12 couples for dinner. We arrived, and they were not ready for us. We actually arrived about 10 minutes after our confirmed time. It was a Chinese fire drill to get us seated 20 minutes later, 30 minutes after our confirmed reserved time.  \"Strike One\": Our salads arrived at the table and the kitchen failed to dress them!  \"Strike Two\": Then our Hanger Steak entrees arrived Cold and Overcooked on the meat and the sides were raw and under-cooked. We should have known it was a goner when we asked for medium-rare and the server said the kitchen only does medium? If, we were there ourselves, we would have got up and left.  \"Strike Three\": The Dessert arrives. They called it: Blood Orange Creme Brule??  It was un-edible. Who ever made this and then let it be served should be fired on the spot. There is not a Culinary School in America that would call this Creme Brule. Ugh!!  Take this as a warning and head over the \"Eleven\" where we dined last night, which was spot on for 3 magnificent courses. If this place is in business 12 months from now, I will be surprised.  Take my advice and head somewhere else.",

The manager, bartenders and staff were still running around prepping (the bar isn't that busy at say 12:30 pm) but they were all extremely attentive to me.  The manager gave me the remote for the TV-which had Mob Wives on-and the bartender chatted off and on with me.  Both were just talkative enough, but not too much, to make a solo eater feel good.  On to the fish tacos (the $16 fish tacos)!  Ohhh myyy goooooness.  Those are the best fish tacos I have ever eaten in my life.  I would have paid $25.  It came with 3, which is way more than I could eat, and this sauce, and avocado, and...I could go on.  Get the frickin fish tacos.    The bartender surprised me with an \"afternoon drink\" which was made up of Hendricks, St Germain, cucumber, sour and simple syrup.  The best drink ever to go with the best tacos ever.  He was letting the servers taste it and they were all in love.  You have to try this place!",

The mussels were also excellent done with a curry lemongrass sauce.  The drinks are good as well as a small but good selection of wines for a restaurant at this price point.  Each time I've been in here, its been packed.  So I'm sure that is why our service was slightly slow.  My friend just texted me yesterday asking where we had gone with the fabulous Risotto....she was on her way there.  This side of the restaurant wasn't too loud and the hightop tables were set up along the wall to give some intimacy to your dining and conversation.  I'll keep going back.",
