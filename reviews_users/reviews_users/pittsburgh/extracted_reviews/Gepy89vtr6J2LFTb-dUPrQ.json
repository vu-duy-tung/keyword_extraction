You can build your own pie with their lists of toppings or choose one of their pre-designed pizzas, which I really like, for variety.  I don't drink beer but they have an extensive selection that my bf loves.  Also a fun place to watch Steelers or Pens games!  My only beef is their customer service, I've had spotty service each time I've been here, waitresses that don't check on tables and refill drinks, etc.  It is always busy when I'm here so that could contribute to the problem.  Worth the trip though, the food is delish.",

After waiting 5 minutes to arrive at a clean table, we sit. There are 2 waitors on the floor, the hostess and someone who is not identified by the bar. We waited while pur kids played some games. No service, a waitress comes around collecting menus, still no service. My oldest child finally asked for a dollar to play some games. After 10 minutes of sitting, we walked out. All 3 employee on the floor looled at us as we walked out. They didnt say anything, they literally watched us all walk out. Burghs has never disppointed on food but service they are lacking!",

    "text": "My Girlfriend and I have been here a couple times. The first time I noticed the atmosphere felt like a biker bar with the Attitudes hanging out of course at the bar.   Each time we arrived at the front and hand to stand there waiting, while the employees leaned on the same bar talking not even noticing we were standing there.  This time some guy employee was busy flirting with 2 other female employees. This was blatantly obvious.  He then continues his conversation as he is grabbing silverware and motioning us to follow him to a booth 2 feet from the females leaning on the bar. This is not where we wanted to sit, I attempted to get his attention before he made it to the table and sat the silverware down but was not able to. I finally explained we preferred to sit in the back by the bar. He re sat us in the back, he was walking so fast it was almost like we were an inconvenience to him.  He placed the silverware on the table while we were still walking up. He passed us as we were making our way and pointed back and said your table is there. And he left. As we sat down my date made a comment that she could not believe how rude he was.  We ordered a pizza. Pretty simple task One would think. 45 min later we received this heaping mess that did not even resemble a frozen pizza you would get at Walmart. chunky tomato sauce for miles falling off of the top. The dough so drenched with this crap that the pizza was falling apart as we tried to scoop the mess onto our plates. Our first bite immediately noticed that it was dead cold and must have been sitting in the back for a good 10 minutes. We had ordered sausage mushrooms, pepperoni and extra cheese. There was no sausage but plenty of extra chunky tomatoes.    It took us another 15 minutes to actually see our waitress come back into the room and me waving at her to flag her down. The first words out of her mouth were \"Do we need a box folks?\" Considering we had already been there well over an hour now, and there was barely a bite out of mine and my dates 1 piece each on our plate and the rest of the pizza was not touched. You would think her first words should have been is everything ok?   We explained that the pizza was cold, terrible and an absolute mess and no we are not interested in ordering anything else. We had no desire to wait another hour for our order just for them to screw that up as well.  Instead of taking care of it right then an there she said oh no, i will be right back. We wait another 10 minutes for her to come back with our adjusted bill. I paid for the soft drink and left a 3 dollar tip. Which i thought was over kill for simply pouring a drink and delivery the mess of a pizza we got and never asking if we wanted refills on our drinks.  The prior visit. The pizza was totally different. It was excellent. The wings were an absolute oily mess of a joke. when the waitress sat the wings on the table the first thing i thought about was the last time i had changed the oil in my car. This is not a good thing. I tried the wings, the sauce was horrible. The wings looked like they had been cooked in motor oil.   I can not believe that in this economy where there are millions of people without work that any establishment allows this kind of service and quality of food to pass for even close to ok. I know tons of fellow veterans that are without work and if given the chance to own and operate an establishment they would pour their soul into it thanking the good lord above they can actually earn a paycheck.  Shame on the owners of this dump. 2 strikes these guys are out. What a terrible experience. If you cant do pizza and cook wings when these are your signature items, it is sure time to hang it up.",

    "text": "This is very hard. The food here was actually very good. Between the four of us, we got a prosciutto and arugula pizza, a veggie pizza, a pepperoni pizza, and a mushroom swiss burger (I know, fat right?)  All of the pizzas were awesome, and the burger tasted great (yes, we ate each others' food lol.)  Now comes the hard part. The service was eh...our server didn't know what kind of Gin they carried, and when one of us ordered a Blue Moon, she put it in, then came back and told us they don't serve Blue Moon there...wouldn't be a problem if that person in our party hadn't had Blue Moon every time she went there. Also, the place just had this \"unclean\" vibe going around...like sticky tables, dirty menus with food crusted onto them, a cook who was wearing gym shorts, and another server whose yellow soccer-looking t-shirt was basically just one giant grease stain. I tried very hard to ignore these things since the food really was very good...and I would've given Burgh's more stars had I not decided to use the restroom during this one fateful lunch....you see, when coming back from the restroom, one can see into the kitchen very well. What I saw was a little bit terrifying. The hotel pans (which are stainless steel) were literally black. I saw what looked like rotten vegetables and greens laying on the counter. I also noticed that the deep fryers had some gigantic, bulbous matter that had apparently poured down the front and sides and become caked on. It looked like piles of insulation foam, but was clearly some type of food debris. Now, mind you, this was simply what I saw from a 3.5 second glance whilst passing by...which makes me shudder to think of what I would find if I were looking for any longer. I do not proclaim to be a health inspector; however I have run nutritional departments and managed kitchens, and have been through countless inspections....this place would have been tagged as soon as an inspector walked in the door.  It honestly made me regret eating the food.",

Good view of multiple sports on TVs from most seats in the front.  The real advantage was that they had dozens of beers on tap, and a nice variety at that. The food was okay, standard pub fare.  We came in right at 5:30, and they apparently got slammed in the kitchen that night, delaying my burger coming out.  It was half an hour or more late and not exactly what I ordered, but I can forgive them considering I wasn't in a hurry and didn't really care at that point (I can say that if this were a regular occurrence there, I'd drop them down to 2 stars, but the waitress seemed sufficiently flustered by it that it seemed a rare occurrence.  She was gracious enough to take both the burger and the beer that I had while waiting off my tab, so no complaints).  All in all, I'd do it again without hesitation, I'd like to go when I am hungrier than I was to explore their menu a bit more (though again, if I was hungry and in any kind of hurry, this experience would have been in the 2-star range).

The food is always good but that's where any positives end.    Last night I brought a group of 10 people to Burghs.  They squeezed us into two tables that according to the hostess should seat 8 people.  Well, we had 10, not 8.  We were very cramped. I tried numerous times explaining this to the hostess who didn't seem to be interested in helping us.    We eventually got a third tablet added which gave us much more room.  For the next several minutes I noticed the staff talking about our party and giving us dirty looks.  I then asked to speak to the owner/manager who told me \"I'm not going to talk to you.\"  I can put up with their long waits to get a table.  I can put up with the ridiculous amount of time it takes to get your food once you order.  I can put up with the fair to poor service (with the exception on Toni at the bar who is consistently excellent).  But I cannot put up with complete apathy, rudeness, and disregard for customer service from the management and ownership.  I will never again step foot inside Burghs.  I will never again bring large gatherings of people there.  I will never again hold my business functions there as I have done in the past.  I will never again support their 5k as I have done for the past many years.    I'm sure me spending my money elsewhere really won't hurt their bottom line and I'm certain my money won't be missed.  What I am certain of is if the owners continue their apathetic attitudes, dont correct the long wait times for food, and dont train their staff on proper customer service then others will not be returning as well.",

    "text": "Been going here ever since it opened up. Here's the skinny on Burgh's.   The place is packed, and I mean PACKED each and ever Friday and Saturday night. There's a good reason, two actually. One is that they have a very strong, if not quite exceptional selection of draft beer. Pittsburgh and it's 'burbs are more Keystone Light than Chimay, so to find some nifty stuff like Anchor Steam, Paulaner and Dogfish Head  on tap is a strong pull. The second is the food. By and large, the food is among the best you'll find at any sports bar in the US. The wings are very good, the salads are Legendary (go ahead big man. Order the cobb salad  and try to finish it all. Not gonna happen), the pizzas are excellent, and the calzones are hot, crispy, soft and gooey. All good.  The bad. Numero uno is the service. On a good night, you might get a table in half an hour, at which point the waitress might pay attention to you. On a bad night, it could be over an hour to get a table and then you'll have to flag down a waiter/waitress every time you want something. Numero dos is the decor (if you can call it that). This place is tired, the carpeting was filthy five years ago and has gone downhill from there, many of the booths have holes in them, the bar floor is never clean, and the kitchen is....ehhhhh. Final problem is the lack of parking. The lot next door quickly fills up and it can be a royal hassle to find a spot.  In all, if you like great food and beer, and can look past the really bad service and other issues, Burgh's is a great place. The fact that they have virtually no competition within 5 miles is another reason why they are busy. If they had a competitior open up that had food as good and better service, they would be in SERIOUS trouble.",

Being that this was a birthday meal for me (paid for by my darling Kay) and that Burgh's bar-food bill of fare was an intriguing read, we ordered a large early dinner, more than half of which was quite appetizing.   For example, Burgh's BIG Pretzels, which we had deep-fried, were astonishingly crisp yet fluffy, the tandem of liquid cheese and honey mustard (both made in-house) thrusting each dough knot into the stratosphere.   The honey garlic oven-roasted wings were thick with brittle skin and juicy, savory, sweet poultry. The wings were so delectable, we used the ranch dressing only for the celery and carrots, and that doesn't happen often.  Doman's Garlic Fries were a pile of \"O\" sticks gone gourmet, almost garishly so considering parmesan and parsely were involved. Cooked twice in hot fat, each tater stave was chip-crisp outside and mashed spud-soft inside. Somebody in that kitchen knows how to use a fryer like a samurai knows how to use a sword.   Things started faltering food-wise when the pizza and burger were finally trotted out. Perhaps the flawed pie was my fault in that I chose my toppings poorly. Considering my natal day, I went wild and asked for proscuitto, caramelized onions, and chopped clams on what Burgh's calls a \"Thin Deck Pizza.\" The slim crust is dusted with cornmeal and is supposedly baked on oven stones, in theory making for a crispy crust. Unfortunately, no crispness happened as the pizza itself was droopy. I felt the toppings went well together, but the crust just couldn't hold them properly. To boot, the sauce was close to nonexistent, and the mozzarella cheese was utterly tasteless.   The Avocado Burger was supposed to be medium-rare but was cooked to an almost arid medium (or was it well-done?). The bacon and vegetables slid off of the rubbery, slick, tragically unseasoned patty and out of the not-so-fresh bun, making this mundane burger a thankless chore to eat. The cole slaw that came with the burger was acceptable and little else.   Service was choppy on the day we visited despite the house not being full. A  harried middle-aged woman who was dressed somewhat provocatively for her age (painted-on leggings, a cleavage-baring sleeveless sweatshirt, and a backwards baseball cap) greeted us while reluctantly bussing tables, complaining to us about how busy the restaurant was. Was she the owner? I hope not.   Further down the path of ineptitude, our server made us feel somewhat rushed, and the food was slow to arrive at our table. Halfway through our meal, we were handed our check. When I mentioned that we might like dessert, I was curtly told that Burgh's doesn't offer any even though a brief dessert menu can be found on the restaurant's website.  I suppose that's what Labella Bean is there for. Stay tuned.   Burgh's has potential. Without the burger, pizza, and unprofessional staff, Burgh's would skip to a 5 star rating from my keyboard without much handwringing.",

In December of 2016 my Water Arobics class decided that a holiday party would be fun. Someone from our group called and reserved their party area for our group. We would have brought 30 to 40 people into the restaurant.    The day before the event our planner called to make sure everything was in order. They were told the manager had received a better offer and reserved the room for another group. This produced a logistical nightmare for us. We had to locate another venue, notify 50 people and deal with deposits and menu selections. This was at the height of the holiday season.   The management never offered us an apology or any compensation for the inconvenience. They may have booked a larger party, but they lost any chance of us even considering them again.",

My husband got the Chicago-style deep dish pizza and basically made love to it because it was so good. There are lots of TVs around the bar and dining room, so you'll never miss part of the game. They have a huge beer list (I mean HUGE - pages!), wines, mixed drinks, and other typical sports bar fare. My only con is the very slow service. Overall, worth the trip and I will be back!",

It is a pretty decent list of beers across many styles and countries.  The beer menu is nicely organized by beer style.  The list is continually updated as well.   Breweries they offer include Troeg's, Great Lakes, Deschutes, Anchor, Southern Tier, Ommegang, Flying Dog...plus your macro's.  They also have a fully stocked bar for other drinks and wine.   They have a small section with beer on shelves and in coolers where are you are allowed to beverages to go.  Mix and match, 6 packs, larger format beers...etc.     They have all sorts of pub food.  Most notable are their pizza and wings.  They also offer, burgers, salads, appetizers, calzones, soups, sandwiches and hoagies.  The pizza is usually really good with a nice crust.  I have had a few soggier crust pizzas, but that is not the norm.  I really like the wings here.  My favorites are the cajun wings.   I have never had any issues with the service.  The servers are usually pretty nice and efficient.  The place can get pretty crowded so a seat at the bar may be difficult.  Overall this is a good place to visit if you are in Bridgeville.",

The wings are just tasty, they have a bunch of flavors but i would recommend the mild or buff bbq.  The only reason i won't give Burghs five stars is the parking situation, their lot is always full so you have to circle a few times waiting for someone to leave, not so bad if you are going in to sit down and eat, but for takeout orders it can be arduous.",

We were a party of 4 coming in on a weeknight. This was my first time coming to the Pub, and my hopes were high for good food- but I never had any food, or even a table. There were a few other people waiting for tables, but for the most part the restaurant wasn't busy- in fact, there were a few empty tables we could have easily sat at. We waited over 10 minutes for someone to ask if we were waiting to be seated. Once the hostess got our info, she said it shouldn't be more then 5-minutes of a wait. We watched frustrated, as people finished and left the restaurant, but no one was seating us. After another 15 minutes, I finally got the hostess' attention to see about being sat and she gave me an impolite response that there would be a table soon. After another 15 minutes, I grabbed the manager and asked why we were waiting over half an hour for a table, and again got a rude response that it would be a few more minutes. He then proceeded to stand by the kitchen and ignore us. When we reached the 45 minute mark, my party and I decided to leave. As we walked out, the hostess thanked us for stopping in. We instead went across the street to Sauce, where we were promptly seated and given good service.  It's one thing if the restaurant is packed and there are no tables- it's another thing when 8-10 tables are empty and I'm getting lip service about when I will be seated. I will not be going back.",

    "text": "The absolute WORST restaurant I have been to this year. I realize it is only February of 2012 and it's very early to make such a bold statement, but this place really is as horrible as I say it is. Let me paint the picture for you: I went to grab a quick bite to eat here with my parents and their bowling league team members before the game started. There are a few other joints close by, but this one seemed like it would be the most accommodating for such a large group with deadlines to meet. When we got there, they were very quick to seat us.. the only perk of our outing. After waiting about 15 minutes to be acknowledged by our server, we grew restless and had to go to the bar area to order our drinks. When we all had drinks, our server stumbled over to the table and asked if we wanted to place drink orders. (This really happened..) One of the members of our party was quick to finish her drink, so she placed an order for a Corona, which I thought was a very simple request. She returned TWENTY MINUTES LATER with a Coors Light. It was obvious that English was not her first language, but you really should be able to process simple requests if you are to be in an English-speaking serving industry. She then took our order for the food, which was a fiasco. She could not grasp the flavor of wings that I wanted. The menu is expansive, which was nice, but they only offered 3 wing flavors. This is normally perfectly fine as I typically don't steer away from buffalo. The problem was that the waitress 1.) did not know the flavors of wings that the restaurant offered and 2.) denied vehemently that they served buffalo wings. I ended up just telling her to bring me wings of any flavor just to get food before we had to leave. The amusing part of this was that she did end up bringing buffalo wings.. though the restaurant definitely did not serve them. The food was relatively quick to come out of the kitchen, which was nice. The only bad part was that some of my wings, in addition to another party member's burger, were cold on the inside. I'm not sure how wings can be fried to death on the outside (gross) but also be cold on the inside. Magic. Once everyone finished eating their subpar food, it came time for the check. This took forever as you can imagine because we had about 4 different parties at our table that required a separate check. The checks were horribly mangled, but because of our time constraint, everyone decided to settle the bill portions with cash. This place is a dump, do NOT waste your time going here. Our table was seated next to a large window that was so poorly installed, we all wore our coats throughout the meal. The interior of a restaurant should not be slightly warmer than outside in the dead of winter. All in all, this place is not worth your time unless you enjoy subpar service/food.",

    "text": "Food was good but served in stages Prior to this evening I had eaten at Burghs about a dozen or so times in the last several years but tonight might just have been the last. For being a Friday night I figured that we would have to wait for a table for 5 but our wait was short (maybe 10-15mins), we were sat and our waitress took drink orders pretty quickly, was patient when a member of our party needed a little extra time deciding what to order to eat. None of us ordered anything complicated. I ordered wings and fries, the waitress even asked if I wanted my fries with dinner or as an app and I answered with dinner. About 15mins after taking our order out came my fries and nothing else. It was another 15 mins when the wings arrived (mine and 2 other members of my party). It took about 30mins for the waitress to bring the calzones that my friends ordered but not the 3rd calzone and another order of fries that was ordered. Never once did she return to check on us. A member of our party searched out a busboy to find a manager then the waitress to find where the missing calzone was. Finally the last portion of our meals arrived just as the manager did. Not that he did any good. We had to ask waitress to split the check and had to \"remind her\" what each of us ordered. We paid our tabs and started out the door. On the way out a member of out party spoke with the bartender explaining our evening as the waitress listened in. Next thing we know she followed us out with $10 worth of vouchers to return. Not likely!",

When the manager did acknowledge us, he said he'd be right there, then went to put away clean dishes, do some things on the cash register, etc. He finally sent a waitress over, who told us it would be at least a 10-15 minute wait, even though there were several open tables.  At that point we'd already waited 15 minutes and from the poor customer service it didn't seem like waiting another 15 minutes would be worth it. Instead, we left and went right up the street to Sauce where we were seated immediately and treated like our business was valued. I won't be wasting time again at Burgh's.",

My wife, son and I stopped in on our way home from the hockey store, because for some reason I had a thought in my mind that the food was pretty good at one point.  It's been a while, so my thoughts could be correct and time has passed so it may have changed.  It started with my son's nachos that he ordered which we basically Toastetos on a pizza plate, covered with that cheese you get at our local stadiums/arenas and they were ice cold!  I ordered the \"jumbo wings\" which turned out to be these tiny wings that looked like they came off pigeon not a chicken.  My wife's Italian bogie tasted like plastic, and my meatball consisted of overcooked meat.  When it comes down to it, I hate using calories on bad food and that's exactly what happened.  Foodies should stay away.  Its a shame, with their great location and some decent food, you could do really well.",

    "text": "We go to 'Burgh's Pizza and Wing Pub often for the lunch buffet of all you can eat salad, pizza and wings. I guess I do judge a book by its' cover, because the first time we went here I was surprised at the quality of the salad bar at a place that has \"Pub\" in it's name. There are the usual greens and raw veggies, long with a wonderful selection of marinated vegetables, roasted red peppers, beets, cheeses and toppings. They make their own salad dressings, and they're really good. The pizza is great, and they bring out a nice variety of vegetarian and meat pizzas, even a white pizza. The wings are the real draw for me, however. Usually they have a choice of three, with mild, garlic and honey, BBQ, spicy and \"kinda\" breaded as recent options. A drink is included in the price of the lunch buffet. They have a great beer selection, and they cater and do special parties, too. I can't think of a better place to hang out and watch a game on one of their 19 plasma screens.The one misstep in a recent dinner outing there was the blackened tuna salad, which was overcooked and not great quality tuna, but what the heck was I doing ordering that there, anyway? Pizza. Wings. Beer. Good salad bar=bonus. Service is friendly and efficient, and the staff seems to know alot of the regulars who come in.  We're lucky to have this place near us!",

I think they have some of the best wings in the area. I always get the blackened gold sauce. I think it's a mix of honey mustard and bbq...something like that. Until recently I had always had the regular fried wings , which were always fully cooked and tasty. I recently tried the cajun style wings, and they are awesome. I'm not sure how to describe them...I guess  you could call them blackened. The menu says they could take up to an additional 30 minutes, but I'm not sure they ever have. If so, they are worth it. As for the pizza, we always get the traditional style, and  it has always been excellent. Crispy crust and the right amount of sauce. Sometimes a little too cheesy for me, but I don't mind. I usually go on one of the beer special nights, one has a bottle special, and one has a draft special. They always seem to have a good selection, and have never been out of what I order.  The service has always been good to me even though it is always packed. That is the only complaint for me, and I suppose it is a good thing...they are always packed when I have been there, weeknight or weekend!",

After waiting some more, we asked about our pizza (once we were able to get our waitress).  Since we were told that 2 other pizzas were ahead of ours, we asked for it to go.

We waited 40 minutes for ANYTHING to come out.  When part of our order did arrive, we received cold wings, cold cheese triangles and hot sausage stuffed peppers that were raw and cold (as in uncooked).  Sent those back and by the time they got those back out, everyone was done eating.  The waitress also explained that the peppers were not really \"raw\" because they are stuffed with lunch meat.  REALLY?  The menu describes these as stuffed with Italian sausage and cheese (which is typically how these are made). The food was terrible and the waitress did nothing to try to accommodate.  Things were so bad that my Son-in-law spoke with management and the owner basically did not care.  Pretty terrible experience.  We won't be back.  The place was pretty filthy today as well.  There are better choices in this neighborhood.  Don't waste your time unless you simply want to belly up to the bar and have a beer and watch a game.",

    "text": "I work at a local radio station planning events and we are always looking for new places to take clients or order catering from for events. I heard some good things about this place and a few friends of mine recently moved several streets down from here so we decided to give it a try late on a Thursday night. Unfortunately the overall experience was not a pleasant one.   I've also worked in restaurant industry for several years (both family owned and corporate) so I felt for the staff  when I saw how busy they were. The place was packed! We decided to the bar and have a drink while we waited to for a table to be ready.   One of the bar waitresses approached us and said she has a table in her section open if we'd like to sit at it but it was probably dirty. No problem! We were just happy to have somewhere to sit, although we thought she may send someone over to wipe the table down (it was covered in the last customers dinner and beer). That never happened, but we looked passed it - I could tell she was flustered with how busy she was.   The waitress, Saray, came back to our table to take our order. One of my friends ordered right away - a Signature Salad and a small pizza - while my other friend and I took a few minutes to check out the menu. The waitress came back and took the rest of our order we got a large pizza and two orders or wings.   We were in no hurry and it was clearly busy so we didn't mind ordering at different times or even waiting longer for our food. My friend who ordered first got her salad but got the wrong salad. My friend apologized for complaining but said this was not the salad she had wanted. Saray took it back and replaced no problem at all.  After our food started to come out, we noticed we got everything except for the large pizza. At first we thought it may be taking a little longer but after a while we stopped Saray and asked about where it was. She ran back and check and said \"I didn't get that, you didn't order a large pizza you just got the wings\" and just looked at us like we had three heads. As someone who has been a server and bartender, I realize people complain about the craziest things and orders sometimes get forgotten when you're slammed but she never ever offered to put our pizza order in she just looked at us. So I just told her to not worry about it and asked for the check.   It took about 15 minutes to get the check . My friend just handed the waitress her card without looking at the bill (a mistake on her part). When she brought back the receipt, my friend looked at it and saw it was way more than what it should have been and took another look. She saw that we were charged for a $9.00 beer that we did not order. At this point, after everything we were just ready to leave but it became an issue when we couldn't flag down our waitress. She seemed to be avoiding us - maybe it was because of the pizza issue.   So my friend went to see if we could a manager to take the beer off the check since Saray seemed too busy at the moment. It took 20 minutes for a manager to come to our table. Before coming to see us, the manager went and talked to Saray about our table. The manager, who was very disheveled looking, aggressively approached us and said \"So she forgot to put your pizza in, what are we going to do about that ?\" I was in such shock that someone managing this business would speak to a customer that way! Then again, after meeting the manager, it became clear why the service was so poor - no one in this place knows what they are doing. I explained to him that the pizza ship has sailed and we were over that but we had a beer that we didn't order on our bill. He took the check and it took him another 15 minutes to take the beer off the check! Then he sent Saray back with new bill and some Burgh Bucks ($8) that she just handed to us and walked away.   Needless to say this was an unfortunate experience - we were in no hurry that evening and were just planning on having some drinks and a pizza. Instead we ended up leaving early and ended up at a different restaurant down the street. It's a shame that a place like this is managed so poorly causing the service to be terrible. I probably won't recommend this place to clients or any of my colleagues. As for my friends, I think they will be going to other restaurants on that street instead.",

If they were charging prices consistent with the Capital Grille or Eleven then I could see people complaining about the food.  However, their food is priced according to the quality.  It is very decent bar food at an affordable cost.  Maybe with the sluggish economy yinzers are expecting more bang for their buck.  You get what you pay for.  This is classic bar food and it is appropriately priced.  They do have a great selection of beers too and I love microbrews.  I've been there a couple times during March madness or during football season to hang out with a friend and watch the game and we always got great service.  Even though I live in the heart of the city I would still stop by Burgh's for a bite when I'm in the area.  Their baked cajun wings are to die for and totally worth the wait:  they do take longer since they are baked in the oven and not fried.  Keep up the good work Burgh's!",

First we got an order of nachos and asked for guacamole on the side, nachos came out and were stale and after telling us that the guacamole was being set out for us, it took another 15-20 minutes to get it, thanks but we were done with the nachos at that point. Then my burger came out, I asked for medium, it was raw. I've lived in Pittsburgh my whole life and know the difference between Pittsburgh medium and dripping blood from the burger so I sent it back. ~20 minutes later I got my burger back, well done this time, still wanted medium, and my whole party was done eating so at that point my dinner was pretty much ruined. The server told me that the manager wanted to give me \"burgh's bucks\" in case I came back and could use them next time. What a joke, the amount he wanted to give me didn't even cover the cost of the burger! Then when I told him that I didn't want them because I wouldn't be coming back, he became confrontational and smartly asked me \"well how do you think medium should be cooked? My guys temp every burger back there.\" I promptly told him that I didn't ask for his attitude and just a resolution to my problem and he continued with his rudeness and admitted that he didn't even look at the burger I sent back, it got to the point that my wife even chimed in by telling him that as a manager his job is to act professional to resolve the conflict and not start one to which he replied, \"Oh, so now I'm not professional?!\" I ended the conversation there and he ended up taking the burger off the bill, but I will NOT be visiting this place again. You are much better off driving a few minutes down the road to the Bottleshop Cafe in Collier.",

Finally the fourth time was a charm. I could tell the server was frustrated and rightfully so because that is completely unacceptable. Food was average at best. I had the Cajun Chicken which was OK but other people at my table ordered the pizza and said it was quite good. Looked to be more on the well done end of the spectrum.

Steak hoagie had very little steak and the steak on it was burned, did not eat more than 2 bites. BPWP- fries were soggy and cheese sauce was not very good. Chicken wings used to be great now they have very meat although the sauce was tasty. Pizza had very little flavor and the crust was burnt. Pierogies were dry and overcooked. Other places with better food options.",

The place was pretty subdued but there were quite a few people out, in my opinion for it being work day.  We started out our meal with the hot garlic wings which had perfectly crisped skin and was mmm so delicious! Followed this with a custom made garlic crust pizza. I have never have a garlic crust pizza and was amazed and impressed by this...The crust set this pizza apart from the numerous other pizzas I have eaten in my lifetime. It was crunchy, flavorful and can be eaten just by itself...I would say it is an elevated version of a garlic bread. Definitely try some of the garlic dough pizzas!   I was pleasantly surprised by the extensive variety of beers they carried from across the country and the world. My friend was a little taken aback by the $10 tag attached to a bottle of Belgian beer but he relished every last drop of it!!  Overall: a great place to come to amazing Pizza, wings and a wide variety of beer selections!",

My friend and I ordered wings and a pizza.  The first issue was that they say they are \"jumbo\" wings. The wings we recieved were by no means jumbo, in fact they could be considered petite. The garlic wings were totally overcooked (dry and crunchy). There was very little flavor to them, lots of grease on the bottom of the basket. The wings are sold in 5's and 10's, what happened to a dozen wings? There is a charge for blue cheese and celery, which was a very small portion. If you love food wings, go elsewhere.  The pizza was tasty, but also overcooked. My friend called it well done. It was not burnt, but was dark and very tough.  They charge $2.59 for a soft drink. Really?   I don't see what all the hype is about this place, but I don't see myself returning anytime soon.",

The wings were so overlooked that there was no meat left on the bones! They should've checked my food before I left and made sure it was right. Then I called for a refund and never heard back from a manager. When I first came in the guy (host) said to wait at the bar for my takeout... Then the bartender just stared at me like I had three heads for 5 mins until the host came back and asked my name to get my order because she (bartender) clearly wasn't willing to work! So he brings out my bag and she finally speaks and asks for payment. Took my food home and was so disappointed.",

Unfortunately, I'm now gluten free, but Burgh's wings and GF pizza are both safe for me. My favorite pizza is still the five cheese pizza (on a gluten free crust) since it has ricotta cheese on it.

The pizza has a nice tomato chunk sauce which I enjoyed but the dough was burnt as it has been in the past. At $22 for a large with pepperoni they had better send out better pizzas.   The misses ordered a Reuben and it was bland and flavorless. It did add flavor to her bowel movement in the next hour though. .

It was 230 on a Friday afternoon. The restaurant was not busy at all. More empty tables than tables that were seated. After eating one and a half wings, I asked the waitress if she could take the wings away. She said she would have to ask her manager what she should do. They did not charge us for the wings. But I was never offered replacement wings. The manager never came over to apologize. This restaurant has just lost two very good customers.",

I  seen 2 other tables with customers and the back ar with about 6-8 customers. Well we ordered seafood bisque, Italian hogie,and 2 orders of breaded wings and fries. It took a long time for the bisque to arrive. Dunno what the problem was,however it was delicious when we finally got it.  The wings arrived overcooked,burnt and way too much seasoning. I asked the waitress where are the fries and she said she had to go back and get them.  Approximately 10 min and half the wings already eaten the fries finally arrived. Not sure what the snafu was but a lot of waitresses walking around and hardly any customers I would of thought the service and the food would in have been spot on. But it wasnt. I'll go back but will tell the waitress to tell the cook do not over fry the wings.",

    "text": "I am a sucker for lunchtime pizza buffets.  I don't know of that many in the Pittsburgh area, but one that I find myself regularly frequenting is at Burgh's in Bridgeville.  The buffet is open on weekdays from 11:30-1:30, and it includes all-you-can-eat pizza, soups (two different kinds), salad bar, drink, and dessert, all for one price.  There is also a daily feature that is included in the price, which is available by request from your server.  Daily features are Italian Hoagies on Mondays. Free Wings on Tuesdays (wings are an additional charge to the buffet on days other than Tuesday). Wednesday's feature is \"Beef on Weck,\" which is a freshly sliced roast beef sandwich on a Breadwork's Kimmelweck Caraway seeded sandwich roll and a side of Horseradish and/or Burgh's sauce (Perhaps my favorite of the daily specials).  Thursday is Kielbasi & Kraut day, and Friday = Fish & Chips (fries).  There are usually about four kinds of pizzas on the buffet and are constantly rotated, so you never know what might be on there.  I've seen everything from plain, to pepperoni, to bacon and pineapple, white pizza with spinach and tomato, to sausage, hot peppers, mushrooms, etc.  One time they even had a \"Hamburger\" pizza.  I feel that it is a pretty good lunch buffet, and I usually always leave satisfied, and with a full belly.",

The buffet included kielbasa and peirogies but you had to ask for them.  You could also get up to 10 wings but you had to ask for those as well.  I went up to the bar and made a salad.  There were lots of choices of items to put on my salad.  As I was doing that the pizzas started coming out.  I took two slices.  The pizza was nice and hot but lacked any flavor.  Bland pizza ruined my appetite.  I ate my salad and left the pizza.  Pizza is one of my favorite foods so it was quite a bummer that I was at a pizza place and left pizza untouched.  Burgh's has been in business many years.  They definitely get a good lunch crowd.  It was almost full when we left.  We had great service, but not great food.  In this case I am going to say that it was just me and I was having an off day.  I will go back another time and try the buffet again.  Next time I will sample the wings as well.  I'll post an update when I go back.",

Once we were seated, our waitress came around and took our drink orders and we decided to place our food orders at that time as well. One adult wing order and a child's pasta came out after a reasonable time. And then the wait began...15 minutes.....30 minutes.....and all the while our waitress was taking food orders to other tables. During this time she asked one adult at our table if they wanted another drink forgetting the other 5 people at the table! After about 40 minutes, we asked her where were the 2 chicken salads, the burger and the small pizza? By the time the other 4 meals arrived, the first 2 people had finished eating. We have been at Burgh's before and have never had a bad experience. However, after last weekend's decidedly horrible dinner out, we won't be going back.",

Like another reviewer on here stated, I keep giving them chances thinking that things will improve, but they never do. It took over a half an hour to get a basket of garlic fries and it took 20 minutes on top of that to get our actual food, which was lukewarm. I was informed that \"pretty much everything\" that was on draft was out after waiting 10 minutes for a beer that I ordered. Shouldn't the server already know what's been kicked if it's \"pretty much everything?\" And before you start thinking they were swamped, the restaurant was basically empty. There was no reason for any kind of delay, even if they were short-staffed. Since this is a consistent, systemic problem, I won't be returning until I hear the place is under new management. Current management either doesn't know or doesn't care how to adequately train serving staff. I can pay $70 for three people to have dinner at a much better restaurant and I'll be out of there in less than two hours.",

Service seemed good, but they were moderately busy.  My wife & I each ordered the buffet. Priced at 10.99 you get salad, pizza, soup, 5 wings, and a sample of the daily special. That was a great opportunity for us to try some different items.  For the wings we got garlic parmesan & honey bbq. The garlic parmesan was a buttery gsrlic sauce with fresh parmesan, which was what we expected & didn't disappoint. The honey bbq was sweet with an almost vinegar flavor and a nice kick. I'd definitely get those again.  The pizzas on the buffet were good and about what you'd expect (crunchy crust, sauce that seemed chunky with a bit of sweetness).",

However, they seemed to be pretty understaffed, as both the restaurant and bar were full, as is to be expected on a weekend night.  Because of this things did not go very smoothly.  My wife and I both ordered a couple of beers during our meals which took very long to get to us. Our appetizer order of pierogies came out still frozen in the middle.  Also, we ended up being there for about an hour and a half, and all we ordered was pizza.  I will say the food is very good.  We had some buffalo wings which were cooked and sauces perfectly.  It went perfectly with their delicious house made ranch.  The pizza was one of the better ones I've had in awhile.  The crust was crispy and flavorful and the sauce had a great flavor.  I also like how they put some of the sauce above the cheese.  I will definitely be back at some point because of the good food, I just wish they would fix some of the service issues.",

I had to explain to her the difference in Southern Tier beers and we never received our waters, but hey that's alright.   Next we ordered pierogies, wings and pizza. She told us the pizza would be 45 mins which is a little crazy, but I'm happy she gave us a heads up! The pierogies came out after a half hour FROZEN INSIDE. Legit frozen. She took them back and brought the same ones back out now just dry and burnt. She did take them off the bill though so we appreciated that. The wings came next. We had the flavor that was both a dry rub and a mild buffalo. They were some of the best wings I've ever had. Very crunchy with an amazing flavor. The ranch was homemade and delicious too! The pizza was last and was actually worth the wait. It was a fresh, thick dough, but not too thick. It was cooked well so it was crunchy and not soggy. They also put sauce both under and on top of the cheese which was very good.  The prices are very fair as well. Overall it was a good experience. They just really need to work on their staffing on a Friday night. Our server was working so hard trying to keep up! I can't wait to go back for those wings!",

Yeah, our waiter was nice but I think we literally had 3 interactions with him the whole night. Once when he took our order, once when he brought us food, and once for the check.  The food is also not that spectacular. I ordered a chicken Caesar salad and it was just lettuce and dry chicken and Caesar dressing. My friend ordered the Super chicken pizza and that was actually really great. My other friend ordered the pierogie appetizer and they were so hard.  Since it's conveniently located close to work, I'll probably be returning. Hopefully the service is a lot better next time!",

Slow to seat, exorbitantly long wait times for your food, and if you're lucky it's all brought out at the same time. On one occasion, three of us got our food but the fourth in our group had to wait an extra 20 minutes for his.   Most recently it took 45 minutes for our food to arrive (not on a busy night), then when we finally were done with our meal it was another 15-20 minutes before our server made an appearance with our check. We could have easily walked out without paying an no one would have noticed.  The worst part is that there are never any excuses offered or apologies given. I'm a pretty understanding person - I know there are situations that can affect service like someone calling in sick, which is why I've returned. But EVERY time the service is lousy and the staff is unapologetic. I have to place the blame on the owners and/or managers who are hiring and training incorrectly.  Maybe, just maybe... if some day I hear that things have improved I will return. But for now I'll stick with Bubba's.",

The wings were prepared in a very rushed manner as they weren't even fully covered with sauce. Upon getting home I noticed my bag was full of sauce as one of the containers was not fully closed. Will head back to dine in but will never use their takeout again.  On a positive note, the garlic parm wings I ordered were awesome. I can't say the same for the buffalo. These were the ones where the sauce was everywhere except on the wings.",

SO many options, literally something for everyone! I love the white pizza, but I like to switch it up to the buffalo chicken salad every now and then. The salads are jammed packed with vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, roasted red peppers, and even chick peas! Their sauces and dressings are all home made and phenomenal. My husband, on the other hand, refuses to get any thing other than the deep dish pizza and buffalo wings. He loves them that much. I wish we lived closer, because we would probably get take out weekly! Definitely a great sports bar to cheer on your favorite Pittsburgh team!  It's always packed on the weekends, so be prepared to wait a little. Trust me, Burgh's is worth the wait!",

    "text": "User J.K. stated my previous review was too vague...so here is a more specific review: I've gone to Burgh's several times in the past. All of the negative reviews, I can attest to. I've never received good service while dining at Burgh's. the last visit in particular, I ordered the guacamole appetizer to start. I was told they had no avocados...then, for some strange reason, I was told by my server that the manager had a few in his office?!  Out comes mashed avocados with tortilla chips...not guacamole! It is more than just mashed avocados. The server never refilled our beverages...not once. Our pizza was kind of mushy in the middle, as if the middle wasn't cooked all the way. I didn't finish my first slice. Just sat and waited for our server to check on us. When she returned, she didn't ask how everything was. She just offered us a box to take our leftovers home. Now, for me to recall that very last dining experience, which I believe was this past summer, it was pretty bad. Even with take out...we have ordered by phone to pick up in, what you are told \"20-25 minutes\". We go in about that time and still wait another 15 minutes. It's frustrating to have such a good location and not give a rats \"you know what\" about your business or the locals who support it. So...just giving a one time example takes up this much space...I have to be vague. These reviews, I believe, are very True to their nature, because going there on my own free will on several occasions, receiving the same bad service with occasionally good pizza, isn't worth my hard earned money. I'll spend it at Cucina Bella, where the food AND service is always great! I hope that was more detailed for you :-)",

They DO need a sign that says to see the host,etc because we had to ask the guys standing in front of us if it was a \"seat yourself\". The \"host\" was certainly not paying any attention to guest walking in the door. We had to put our name on the list and were not told how long the wait was (maybe a more attentive host would help give a better rating). We only waited 5 min to be seated; in the bar area. Our server Shannon was very friendly and when we told her this was our first visit, she told us what they r known for (pizza and wings). We decided to try the (5) wings as an app and a toss salad to start. The wings had great flavor and meaty. We wanted to steer away from the usual pepperoni pizza so we ordered the \"super chicken white pizza\" and added bacon! It was very tasty! We loved the crust! It was a little dry...not much sauce, but the chicken was tender and plenty of broccoli. A small was more than enough for the two of us considering we had the wings and salad. She told us the burgers r huge and very good so we plan to come back to try one. Atmosphere is typical friendly local bar. Looking forward to returning for a burger.    Try it...you'll like it!!",

The prices were affordable, and they provided PLENTY of food for our party- we had a lot of leftovers at the end of the night. We really appreciated that they never skimped on food towards the end of the evening. For our group of ~30, we had one dedicated staff member who worked hard to keep the food and drinks stocked (we were doing a buffet style dinner, so one person was more than enough). The booking process was also very easy- Dan was easily accessible and happy to take my calls on his cell phone when he wasn't working. If we ever had the need for another private party in the area, I would certainly consider booking with them again.",

Burgh's somehow lacks the class of the Galaxy theater.  But you can expect a bad pizza bar for lunch, fantastic deep fried pretzels with the world's best honey-mustard, a nice selection of beers (hurray for the Belgian revolution), and some townie sight-seeing.  I feel at home already.",

They tell us a short wait so we go to the bar waiting and waiting so we ask the bartender if we can order wings now as its 30-35 minutes to cook . She says sure . So we order assuming will sit soon only to find our table was giving away !! My wife and daughters find the manager Tom as he seemed bothered and unwilling to help so we decide to leave . He says you have an order in for about 70 dollars we said yes we do but if you can't seat us we're leaving and he says I'll call the police at that comment I stand up and let him know , look dude you've given the girls a hard time with seating and now your calling the police lol , to funny so I said you do that , please call them . I'll wait for this just to make a complete fool out of you . He got snippy with me saying I don't appreciated that and we left .    Not sure who Tom is but he's sure a fine representative of Burgs , we won't return that's certain !!  I had to place 1 star above just to enter a review . Classy operation !!!!",

The food is very good I have never had bad food here and the beer selection is not bad my wife and I attemp burgh's about once a year each time hoping they fixed there service issuse always to be disappointed.",

    "text": "Wings, pizza, and a monstrous selection of great beers... ah, yes please.  Burgh's has become a staple of mine on each trip to the Burgh to visit my family.  For those of you in, or around, the South Hills, you must stop here.  It's very similar to Fat Heads in Southside.  I'm a big fan of the hot, garlic, and cajun-hot wings.  For the unfamiliar, the cajun-hot come with a blackened, somewhat ashy crust.  The texture can be outputting for some, but the flavor is awesome (fyi - it takes a little extra time for the cajun-hots, so be aware).  My other favorite is the garlic-hot, but it's a mandatory rule that if one person eats them, everyone at the table must eat them (i.e., not recommended for dates).  The True reason to go here is for the beer.  They have over 20 beers on tap (I can't remember the exact number, but I always seem to find something that I haven't tried before), and their bottled beer selection is equally extensive.",

And everything else on the menu is decent * Excellent beer menu - lots on tap, 100+ bottles * Family friendly  * Very cool bar area that's usually pretty busy  The Bad: * The service is very slow.  I've been there 30+ times and you will NEVER get food under 30 min from when you ordered.  They are either understaffed, poorly managed, or both. * Dirty - The carpet in the dinning room is nasty and every plate is stained. I frequently have had to ask for a new plate either b/c it was dirty or wet * Sports Bar? - There are TV's everywhere, but they don't have the sports packages to be able to show any game.  Everyone is stuck w/ whatever is on the network channel.   * Parking - Good luck.  On a weekend night, you will not be able to find parking.   Overall: Good food and decent atmosphere...But, if there were more places in Bridgeville/South Fayette Burghs would lose a lot of business.",

Anything that has pastrami, egg, and bacon, all on the same thing is totally me(Its practically what I order as Primanti Brothers everytime)  As far as the customer service, I had no complaints, but I will say that we were a party of two.

With a name like \"Pizza and Wing Pub\", I would have assumed that those two menu items would be top notch. I decided to give the poultry a try and was completely disappointed. The order of 10 garlic parmesan wings resulted in 2 flats and 8 drums (inexcusable) and they were fried to a crisp, leaving a chewy leathery remnant of fowl. I was charged $0.70 for a half-full mini-cup of \"blue cheese\" which was a rather cheap dressing with no actual chunks of blue cheese present.  The waitress didn't take notice that the grown man consumed only 6 of the 10 chew toys, and was rather surprised when I asked for more blue cheese after the first two flats were consumed.  My wife accompanied me on this venture, and received the wrong brew (which they quickly replaced with the correct one). A completely excusable mistake had the other issues not followed. My wife ordered a cheddar cheeseburger which tasted rather like a steamed clump of ground beef (I was rather famished after giving up on my wings and didn't believe her that the burger wasn't tasty; I apologized later for doubting her).  I do not plan to return. 'Hope this was helpful.",
