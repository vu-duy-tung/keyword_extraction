    "text": "I'm writing this review after returning 2 days later. I had leftovers yesterday, so I am technically eating Bae Bae 3 days in a row.  On Monday I had the build your own plate. I chose tofu meatballs in a mushroom curry gravy and glass noodles. It came with squash tempura, salad, and cucumber kimchi. The meatballs were the tastiest vegan concoction I have ever had. The kimchi was so good, a tad sweet rather than sour, which I liked. And the tempura was perfectly crispy and delicious. I had enough to eat for dinner the next day.   Today I ordered the tofu kimbap with miso soup. It also came with the salad and tempura. The tofu kimbap has a nice plum sauce on it. I do wish it was cut in small pieces. It was difficult to eat delicately. But who am I kidding? I don't care.   The service was great, too! You order at the counter, where a super nice guy explains the menu and specials and there are displays of the food so you can see what you are ordering. There is no tipping, but there is a jar collecting for the humane society in lieu of tips.   The restaurant itself is small and is probably more conducive to take out, but it is quite cute and quaint if you decide to eat in.   I only come to the 'burgh on business, but I will be returning to try all the items on each visit. Bookmarked as a Pittsburgh fav in my yelp app.",

    "text": "I have been watching this space since The Umbrella Cafe left and was happy to see something new in the space. The decor is the same bright airy decor with a front counter showing the available dishes. A few sides like glass noodle and rice, followed by proteins of beef, pork, chicken and vegetarian options, followed by extras like kimchi and crab salad. You create a meal from those options and they also have tea and coffee.   I have to say that I was really hopeful but not impressed by this place. The service was great and I was greeted with a smile. The restaurant was clean and full but I did not wait long.   However, the food was on par with your basic run of the mill Asian buffet food. It was lukewarm to start and the glass noodle dish was barely spiced. The bulgogi was uninspired and had a gummy texture. I was really looking forward to this dish as I had great bulgogi from the Mr bulgogi food truck the week prior. This was not even close. Its as if they used less spice to appeal to taste and I understand that. It could also be the lunch rush and I will go back again later in the day to give them another chance but this was not better than a panda express.   I was really hopeful that this would bring traditional Korean to downtown and they could get there but right now they are missing the mark.",

Good thing I stayed on Smallman Street and this was within walking distance. Parking downtown can be a nightmare and expensive to boot.   The restaurant is rather small so you order and pay at the counter. The gentleman behind the counter was extremely pleasant, explaining their specials and the sides that I can choose from the \"Build a bowl\" concept, which I opted for. My side was a seaweed salad. Never had it so thought I would try it.   Delivery of the food was very quick and the price not too bad. It was served in a cardboard container so you can quickly leave if a fire breaks out or some other catastrophe so I appreciated that. The plastic utensils were flimsy enough to be safe on any flight so no need to worry about stabbing anyone with the knife as it bent as I cut my tofu into smaller cubes.   The food was very good and plentiful. The seaweed was interesting. Would I get it again...maybe after a couple of glasses of wine. Not that it was bad, it was just too oceanic for me. I ate it anyway.   Overall, I loved the scene and the food so I would certainly go back again.",

I had the tofu with plum sauce, which I was a bit skeptical of at first - but the flavor really shines through and the texture of the tofu was amazing.   It is very difficult to balance crispness and a soft center in tofu, but this was worlds apart from the store-bought blocks of bean mush I'm used to having. The side salad was also very tasty and the sharp edge on the sauce took hold of the flavor, which is really what you want with raw vegetables.",

The best part of Bae Bae's kitchen is the protein offerings, I have had both the bulgogi beef and the fried chicken. Both tasted delicious and had pretty good serving sizes. Additionally, the sides such as fried veggies and glass noodles as a base make for a very delicious combo. It is also worth noting they are unique sauces that complement their protein such as honey wasabi sauce and plum sauce. The one drawback to Bae Bae's is that it can get a little pricey but nothing more than $15-20. Overall, wonderful place.",

The space is really small with only about four tables and at one point, the line circled the entire place where the end of the line was right at the beginning! Anyhow, I was willing to overlook this if the food was good. I got the beef with noodles and I thought it was pretty decent. The flavor was mild, but still quite tasty.

However, they need to improve their process to filling orders / relaying orders to the kitchen because it is currently not a positive experience.  I have only been to Bae Bae's twice - once during lunch hour, and once in the evening when the restaurant was very quiet. Both times my order was processed long after people who paid after me, and the second time one item from my order was missed, so the rest of my food got cold while I awaited the last item. Both times I waited 20+ minutes for my food.  Normally I'm pretty accepting of this type of mix up in casual restaurants, but for the price point at Bae Bae's I would expect much better service. They did apologize and gave us a complimentary add-on, but that does not make up for the majority of my $50-dollar 2-person meal being cold and sitting out for almost half an hour before I could eat it.   Hopefully they can evaluate their order process so their service can be as good as their food!",

Along side that was an array of flavors, greens, and their amazing noodles - so fresh, and fairly quick. It was the perfect amount of food to have a truly satiating but not uncomfortable meal. I would recommend Bae Bae's to anyone. Another thing to note, especially for this place, is the cozy interior and friendly employees. I will, without a doubt, be back.",

It's set up like a qdoba/mod pizza, but Korean food. You pick a protein, then rice/noodles, then a small side like kimchi or cucumber kimchi. It also came with couple of these like fried sweet potato and a salad, which were both delicious! Everything tasted SO fresh and yummy! Really, everything was SO good!   It seems they do change menus... and the lunch and dinner are different also.   The atmosphere is beautiful inside with tons of plants/flowers. They also don't accept tips, instead donations for dogs...which is another great thing about this place. I will DEF stop in anytime in Pittsburgh!",

The cashier, Daniel, (he made me feel like a welcomed guest, every time a went to talk to him he called me by name) guided me on the different choices. I decided to create my own plate. You start with either: rice, noodles (clear) or salad. 2nd pick a protein: organic grass braised short ribs, Korean fried chicken, organic bbq pork belly, or organic crispy tofu. 3rd pick a side dish: kimchi, seaweed salad or sweet potatoes (thinly sliced, tempura battered and fried)  My choices were: noodles, chicken, and the sweet potatoes. The meal came with a tossed salad that had a mildly flavored chili dressing. There was also a wasabi sauce ( this will clear your sinuses for sure) on the side to dip your chicken in.   I want to describe this food as Korean comfort food! The two large pieces of chicken was tender and crispy and so were the multiple pieces of sweet potatoes. The noodles were lightly seasoned and a perfect accompaniment to the rest of the meal and the salad was a good balance to the meal.   The meal was well worth the price and so fulfilling!",

    "text": "Yesterday I finally did it. I was going to meet a friend for dinner and I said we should come here. It has been on my radar for months and when I finally have the chance of being downtown this was a place I knew I had to pick. I was really excited when my friend agreed with me and we made a date for Bae Bae's Kitchen. After hearing all the hype from all the other reviewers and from my friends who live downtown I was excited. And I will say they lived up to the hype. When I walked in they were just opening for their dinner at 5 PM. Since my friend was not there yet the man behind the counter was kind enough to explain, in incredible detail, all of the choices that were in front of me for dinner. He was so friendly and incredibly  thorough it was great.   The atmosphere inside was very homey. I love all the plants on the walls and in the window. I will say that it was a bit chilly inside but not so much that it was distracting.  So when my friend got there we went up to order. And I got the glass noodles, with the Korean Fried Chicken, the seaweed salad, and the Bulgogi Kimbap. The noodles and kimbap both came with a salad and the kimbap also came with miso soup.   I have to say that everything that I ate was amazing. The orders come out pretty quickly and the food was great. There was even enough for me to save for lunch the next day. Any time that you go out and they give you enough food for lunch as well as your meal at the time is good in my book. The sauces that came with the Korean Fried Chicken, Wasabi honey sauce, was the most amazing thing that I've had on chicken in a long time. The chicken was also fried to perfection with a delicious panko breading. The chicken also was organic so you can take that how you may. All I know is it was delicious. We also got some of the vegetable tempura. This was also very good. It was a mixture of sweet potatoes and squash. Again fried to perfection with a lovely panko breading. I dipped it in my honey Wasabi sauce yummy.  I look forward to coming back to try more on their menu. This place really does live up to its hype. I will come back just because the service was so very friendly. The menu is also great and I cannot wait to try more things on it.",

For the uninitiated, the ordering process isn't too awky, but might be made less so by speaking to the counter person around the side of the glass divider, as opposed to trying to speak thru or over it. Just read the notes on the blackboard and you'll be in there like swimwear. I might be as white as rice but their Napa cabbage kimchi was some of the best I've ever enjoyed. It was light, crisp, tangy, zesty and tart. My vegetarian dining partner and I agreed that if this place was near where we lived, we would both happily enjoy a meal or three from this place every week - guilt free.",

I was pumped to hear about Bae Bae's but feared it wouldn't meet my expectations.   I was wrong. The food was exactly what I was hoping for.  I would best describe it as LA modern Korean--fresh clean food, not perfectly authentic, but very clear where the roots came from.   Most of all, their banchan (side dishes) were on point. The best kimchi I've ever had in Pittsburgh (there isn't that much). Most importantly, they use the correct Persian cucumber for their cucumber kimchi which keep the crispness better.   I'll also say, the service was very thoughtful and intentional, something that I find is often lacking in Pittsburgh restaurants.",

Ever since the previous restaurant there closed (Umbrella Cafe, a favorite of mine since I moved in), the empty storefront made me sad to walk by.  I had been monitoring the space for a while and knew a place called Bae Bae's Kitchen was opening up, but it had been hard to find much information about it.  I had no idea it had opened until I walked by today.  Korean food is one of my favorites, so I was thrilled to try it.  I had a plate with the special egg and onion fried rice and bulgogi with one side dish (I chose seaweed salad) for $13.  I was also given a cup of kimchi and some miso soup and Thai iced tea.  All the food was delicious.  I especially liked the bulgogi.  The service here was very friendly, even when an influx of people came in.  The ordering was convenient... you just go up to the counter where they display the options for your plates (or grab and go items such as kimbap).  If I had one complaint about my experience, it would be that the pork belly advertised on the menu was not available today.  But it is understandable, as they are just starting out.  I will definitely be back.  This is a worthy successor to the Umbrella Cafe.",

If you're in the mood for something different, I suggest Bae Bae's",

During a casual conversation with The employee I was ordering my food to, I briefly mentioned how I decided to get Bae Bae's Kitchen to treat myself after a horrible, long day at work. After I ordered my food I went to sit down while I waited for my takeout order. While I was sitting down the employee came over to me with a sample of the bubble tea, he simply said \"here's some bubble tea, sit back, relax & take a load off\". That was the best part of my whole day. There is so much to a restaurant besides the taste of the food. So THANK YOU to Bae Bae's Kitchen for not only have the best food but having the BEST customer service!",

    "text": "I can't believe it took me as long as it did to give this place a try. One of my health-conscious coworkers frequents Bae Bae's on days he allows himself the treat of going out to eat for lunch, and I am very strict with myself about packing my lunch. I decided it was time to treat myself, too, and we went to Bae Bae's on a sunny Friday afternoon.  We walked in and got right in line. I love the cute terrariums and the bar you can sit at in the front of the restaurant. Places that are well-lit with natural lighting have a warm, comfortable feel about them and you get lots of natural light here.  Ordering here is super simple and you start with a choice of protein. You can choose from beef, pork belly, Korean fried chicken (KFC), and crispy tofu. Next, you choose two sides. Your first choice is between rice, salad greens or glass noodles, and the next choice is between tempura veggies, seaweed salad, or kimchi. You can get some sides of Kim Bob (almost like sushi but with any protein choice and veggies rolled up in rice and seaweed) or a daily special as an extra if you'd prefer that. One of my favorite things about the menu is that it's organic! This is a great place to go if you want something that tastes good, is good for you, and is affordable.  I'm always one to opt for chicken over beef and pork, but I like tofu, too. This time I decided on the KFC because my friend recommended it, and the pictures I've seen made it look incredible. For my sides I got the glass noodles and seaweed salad, which are two of my favorite things. You get a small side salad no matter what, so I still got my serving of veggies in! The chicken was perfectly crispy, and each box comes with two HUGE chicken strips with wasabi honey sauce. I'm a self-proclaimed condiment fanatic, and the honey wasabi was uniquely delicious in all the right ways.  Portion size here was also part of my decision to give Bae Bae's five stars as the box I got for about $12 was enough for me to get 2 solid meals out of it. I got a box exactly like the one I got to bring home to my boyfriend and he also loved everything about it. Needless to say, we'll be coming back to Bae Bae's, and the convenient downtown location makes this place a great choice for lunch or dinner.",

Cute environment and super friendly service. A bit expensive for the portion size, though - $13 for bulgogi.   I was excited to come here due to the reviewers on Yelp loving Bae Bae's. I came right as it opened at 11:30am, and was surprised at how green and lovely the ambience was. There were so many plants in the restaurant, creating a calm and serene natural atmosphere. It was also very colorful and aesthetically-pleasing.   The food itself was great. The bulgogi was marinated perfectly, albeit a tad too sweet for me. It had a distinct Korean flavor, which made me extremely happy, because I'm usually not a fan of fusion food. The kimchi was also well-made and fresh, and the rice was good too - sticky and warm. I usually dislike salads, but was able to finish all of my salad at Bae Bae's. It complemented the flavor of the bulgogi very well, and the crisp, fresh vegetables was a great contrast to the heavy, flavorful meat. The meal left me 110% full, yet refreshed at the same time.   I will definitely come back here again! As I said before, it's kind of expensive for the portion size, but it's an amazing option for healthy Korean fusion food that manages to keep its authentic flavor as well.",

    "text": "I'd been eyeing this place for a while and I finally decided to come on a Monday afternoon. We arrived right before the lunch hour rush began and snagged the window table with a lovely view of the sunlight pouring through the spring leaves on the street. I'd highly recommend sitting there if you can, it was nice to feel the sun and take in the atmosphere of the hanging plants. There's additional seating in the back too, but I personally like natural lighting.  Not being too hungry, my friend and I decided to share the KFC as our main entree. I wanted to try their wings alone, but they were sold out of these at that point in the month. We got the noodles  and tempura veggies as a side. There was a wasabi sauce that accompanied it, but I asked for if there were any other ones and the guy at checkout kindly handed me a plum sauce. I personally enjoyed the plum sauce more than the wasabi one.   The food itself was really good. The combination of the fried parts with the crisp salad and cold noodles helped satisfy my craving. If I would go back and change something I might have gotten the beef instead of chicken to reduce the amount of oil, but it wasn't too overwhelming and I didn't feel heavy or gross after eating it. The chicken was tender on the inside and crispy on the outside, i kept wanting to take more bites. And to know that these ingredients have good origins also helped my conscious.  We also got ginger beer and bubble tea as drinks $4 each. They weren't the greatest compliments, or at least not worth their price. But it was a good experiment. I'd still go to chick n bubbly for my bubble tea.  Overall, I had high expectations going in and I believe that they were met. The ambiance, the food, the price, it was worth it for a fulfilling meal. Definitely would come back to try their wings when they're back in stock!",

    "text": "If I have one issue on Yelp, it's that 100% of my reviews thus far have been four stars. No variety what so ever. This review will be no exception.  I went to Bae Bae's Kitchen with a coworker for a late lunch on a Friday. It was moderately busy, but being a small restaurant, it fills up fast regardless.  To order at Bae Bae's, you pick a base, protein, and side. I chose stir-fried glass noodles, Korean fried chicken, and a cubed daikon kimchi. They also include a small side salad in your box (the box doubles as both a bowl and a take-out container). For a drink, I went with a Thai iced tea with tapioca balls. Including the tip, I paid $22, which seemed reasonable for a restaurant in the city that sits at the upper end of fast-casual dining.   The noodles were pretty good, the side salad was okay, but I was a bit disappointed by the Korean fried chicken. Some of my disappointment is my own fault, as I wasn't expecting the katsu-style fried chicken cutlets that were served, but rather a double fried bonchon-style chicken. The chicken, while well-cooked, wasn't very flavorful and left me wishing I had gotten the bulgogi like my coworker. My favorite part of the meal was actually the daikon kimchi, which smelled like a regurgitated garden salad, but was fresh and bright tasting with a satisfying, crunchy texture and slight spiciness.   Another redeeming aspect of Bae Bae's is the giant, street facing window, adorned with plants, lightbulbs and hanging, glass terrariums. Not only does it look nice, but it provides plentiful natural light.  All in all, I enjoyed my lunch at Bae Bae's. The food, on a whole, was pretty good and wasn't unreasonably expensive, and the inviting atmosphere is a reason to go back.",

The decor was adorable, and even the covered eating area and front patio decor was placed and purchased with an eye for beauty.   Dishes are a little pricey but I had enough for leftovers. You choose a base, a protein, and a side for around $15.  I got the glass noodles, KFC (that's Korean fried chicken for noobs), and seaweed salad for the side.    They also have milk tea and boba but I decided against it.   The verdict: glass noodles were a little less cooked than I like but flavor was ok. The chicken patty was crispy but the seasoning did not feel authentic. The honey wasabi sauce that accompanied it is lovely though.   And I was most disappointed by the side. I was expecting green wakame with a bright dressing and got a red kelp with a heavier oil based dressing.  Maybe I should have asked before I ordered it without looking though.   Overall, a decent experience for Asian fusion in downtown Pittsburgh but not something I would crave.",

    "text": "First time to try out. When I got to the restaurant I was excited to see that there was no line to wait on. Since most reviews I saw before coming is that there is always a line out the door. Walking in the ambiance of the place is very warm, welcoming and somewhat romantic. The place was very clean and The staff was very friendly.   I ordered a KFC \"Korean fried chicken\" for dine in. As the food was delivered to our table I was somewhat disappointed to see our food served in To go boxes since we were eating in. Maybe that's just they're style but it just wasn't what I was expecting. For the food itself, I must say it is the biggest disappointment of all. For a \"fried chicken\" dish, I expected there to be an actual bone in fried chicken. What it is a panko covered chicken breast fillet. There was no Korean flavor to the chicken itself and apparently no sort of seasoning at all. As in no salt and pepper. The dish was incredibly bland. That not even the kimchi or wasabi sauce (which was gross btw) can salvage it. Overall a very unpleasant dish.   If you're looking for an \"instagramable\" place then this is the place to go to but if ur looking for good and satisfying food then I suggest skipping.",

This place had great food. I've been so tied up with work and social life I haven't had a chance to stop in to the new spots popping up all over our fair city. Pleased and proud to say I specifically made time for this place. How could I not. It's fast. It's casual. It's awesome. The location is great. The food is great. The staff were helpful and quick with any suggestions when asked.  For an american that has never had a chance to try real korean food, this was a superb treat. I will definitely be back to taste test more of the menu and bring some friends with me next time.",

Sides of cucumbers and Kim chi were quite nice, though together a meal runs a bit high at 13$. We will be back to try it out again.",

Their front window is full of live plants, and their high ceilings and open concept was refreshing. I spoke with Ashley, the co-owner, and she was super sweet.  I didn't even get started with the food yet! To keep it short, the food is fresh to order, healthy, and tastes great! The spices and subtle sweets complimented each other, and the salad was a good balance to the bulgogi. Also- take the Kimchi pickles if they have them.  On. Point.  To top it off- they made special Fruity Pebbles Rice Krispies.. with gummy bears! Delicious, even though I had to break up eating it into two sessions to avoid a sugar rush.  Bottom line- if you are in the area, and are on the hunt for  a healthy and tasty meal with Korean inspiration- Go here, it was the best meal that I had in Pittsburgh! Good, fresh, \"clean\" food that doesn't taste \"healthy\".  If, for some reason, I'm ever in Pittsburgh again- I will make it back for another go!",

Was working down Liberty Ave trying to find it. No big signs but recognized the lights/plants from a photo from here. Went in and go to the counter. Super friendly staff explained how to order. Got the last Beef (went at 6:30 and sold out already) but was ok because the pork belly was equally as good. My sister said fried chicken was really good as well. The chicken was served with a wasabi/honey sauce-SO GOOD. No sure if you can ask for a side of it but it was delicious with the sweet potatoes. I would still recommend getting the beef first if they have it. Meals came out after 10-15 minutes. They don't look like much but are so filling. I had to take some home, but luckily tasted just as good the next day. The only disappointment was the overpriced tea/coffee. But I say it's worth a try if you never had Vietnamese coffee before. I can't wait to go back. It was that good.",

The person who attended to us was super nice and very accommodating to food allergies and preferences. Once you get over it not being a traditional Korean restaurant, it's a great find. The portion was enough for two meals for me. I prefer tofu that is not fried and prefer less sweet sauces, but I had the plum sauce on the side and used a little Sriracha. The glass noodles were springy and fresh. The taro milk tea was sooo good too.",

The noodle were also great and went elk with the beef. The vegetables were a great crunch to go with the dish.  I honestly have no idea what type of vegetables they were but they were good.

From lunch during the week to dinner with the family on the weekends, the food is always amazing.   It comes out quick like fast food but always being made fresh, with fresh ingredients.  I wouldn't say I have a favorite because I often jump between everything and find it hard to decide.  The KFC, bulgogi, and chicken stir fry are VERY good, and love how they bring in other random dishes as well and find myself trying those or sometimes regrettably missing out on the specialty dishes after seeing them on social media, lol.  I took my mother in-law who lives a few hours away to Bae Baes last year.  She was born / raised in Korea and is usually unimpressed by some attempts at Korean food..... She liked the food a lot and often talks about the place when we visit her.  Her co-sign says a lot in my book :)   Anyway stop in, try one of their iced or hot drinks,   the desserts and build your meal selecting the options you want.  Sit outside in the outdoor garden when its nice or the nicely decorated inside.  They pack it up nice for to go as well.    Tell them Jay sent you!",

If the grease stays on your lips, it's never a good sign.  Service: Great - You can be in and out of there in about 5-10minutes, even with a line. Staff is always friendly and willing to explain things to new explorers.  Overall: Recommend - If you're downtown or craving Korean, it's a great spot to grab a bite. It's nothing like what you would get in a bigger city like NYC, but it does the trick.",

Loved the decor (they have plants hanging everywhere!!) and found it super casual and fresh. Now the food...delish!  I'm so happy to have finally found a place Downtown with awesome Korean food, on par with the Korean food I've had in NYC. The wait was a little bit, but they were definitely preparing the food fresh which was so worth it.  I started with the noodles and had the Korean fried chicken with the soybean sprouts as a side. The noodles were nice and chewy with yummy veggies, not too oily or salty. The chicken was AMAZEBALLS, surprisingly super moist with a great crispy crust. The sides were also great and the wasabi honey dipping sauce for the chicken was great as well. Can't wait to come back!",

It was worth trying for sure, but i wasn't blown away by top notch interesting cuisine.  I had the KBBQ and got a resonably large portion of food in a fast casual setting without any fuss. I guess what i'm really trying to convey with this is that I had no issues or exciting moments when eating this food. Generally 3 star reviews are the hardest to write because this place was generic to the point of it being mostly non memorable, which, is both a good and a bad thing. You should try it, but if you don't go back that's essentially what I was thinking would happen.",

    "text": "I have no earthly idea why I haven't reviewed my favorite mid-level restaurant in Pittsburgh yet. It's stupid. Stupid! Why do we always ignore the ones we love the most?  Bae Bae's has been feeding me at least three to four times a week now since I started a new job about six months ago. It's practically my home away from home now. I thought I might starve or go broke trying to eat downtown. So much gross. So little good.  But I love the ritual of getting out of the office and sitting down in a decent locale and just eating. Packing lunch gets so sad.   So why Bae Bae's? Because their food makes you feel good. I never feel sick after eating there. Or regretful. Or disgusted with myself. That's worth $20 right there.  And oh my heavenly stars is their Bulgogi good! I've tried almost everything there and it's my favorite by far. You can't really go wrong with whatever you order but just shut-up and order the bulgogi. Trust me on that. And get it with the rice so it can soak up the lovely juices. Next you should get the veggie tempura. The sweet potato is my favorite. Broccoli is fab too if they have it. You can get other sides like kimchi but the veggie tempura is a perfect accompaniment to the bulgogi. And whatever you do, don't leave without the Vietnamese coffee. It's the best I've ever had. Their Thai iced tea is great too but oh man is that coffee the best. I get quite cranky when they run out. If they have the bulgogi wontons, just shut-up and order those too. But \"I already have bulgogi on my plate,\" you say? Seriously? Why are you denying yourself even more bulgogi? Shut-up.  Pro Tip: If you're a frugal eater, you can easily make two meals out of one to go order - everything warms up perfectly.   Other things to note: this place is very much like a little oasis in gritty, rude Pittsburgh. I always hate to step back out onto the street. And while the weather holds, they have a pop-up outdoor area right on Liberty Street.   Run! Don't walk! And stop complaining they're too pricey ya meatheads. This is not some $8 GorgeFest. Their food is organic, fresh and homemade -  so it costs more. Duh.  Actually I'm already regretting writing this review. I don't want any more people in line in front of me. But Bae Bae's must be shared.",

    "text": "Bae Bae's Kitchen serves up Korean-fusion food in a fast-casual environment. While having a limited menu, the execution on everything is near flawless.   I ordered the Korean Fried Chicken with Glass Noodles and a side Spicy Crab Salad, and every order comes with a side salad in a spicy vinaigrette dressing. The attention given to the quality of ingredients and presentation is phenomenal, especially for a fast casual location. The Korean Fried Chicken comes with 2 chicken breasts, and is coated in panko and lightly fried till golden brown, yet remains far from oily (a huge plus!). The KFC also came with a cup of Honey Wasabi dipping sauce that was very unique and incredibly tasty. The sweetness of the honey comes through and finishes with the tingling and small kick of Wasabi. Even if you're not a fan of Wasabi, I highly recommend giving this sauce a try - it tasted exceptional on everything!The Glass Noodles I think were my favorite option at Bae Bae's - they're incredibly tender and the large chunks of onions and scallions sauteed in sesame oil is just as good as it sounds. The Spicy Crab salad was actually spicy and went great with the KFC. They have a ton of other offerings as a \"side option\" such as Cucumber Kim chi, vegetable tempura, etc.   They also offer a daily special - I think the day I visited they were serving Pork and Rice, but I think you have less customizability with the daily specials as I couldn't swap out the Rice for Glass Noodles. I can't wait to go back soon and see what other daily specials they offer.   This was my first time to Bae Bae's Kitchen, but it will definitely not be my last visit.",

We came here during early dinner on a weekday and it was pretty empty. I wasn't too thrilled that the food was kind of buffet style where it was already made and you saw them put it on the box, this just doesn't seem as fresh as if they were to make it in the back as you don't know how long that food has been sitting there.   We got the pork belly with the glass noodles and fried squash to go. By the time we got home, the food was pretty cold but it didn't bother me. The food was okay. The pork belly wasn't seasoned that well as I couldn't taste anything and the noodles weren't even close to the best ones I had. My favorite part was the fried squash which surprisingly was good.

The cucumber kimchee was a little bit sweeter than traditional kimchee, which I liked. They have a very well-decorated back sitting area and provide wooden disposable forks and chopsticks.   My only complaint is the prices. The cheese wontons were $4, but we only got 3 small ones. The meal was $12 with tofu, which is slightly higher than other places I would consider comparable to this one. However, we did get a lot of food in the main dish.

When we ordered, the staff took extra time to explain to us the menu and walk us through the ordering process. I got the KFC (Korean fried chicken) with a side salad and kimchi. The chicken was delicious and the salad was a pretty large portion. My only complaint is the small prepackaged portion size of the kimchi, it's so good I could have eaten 4 of them! Also; they don't accept tips, they use tip money instead to donate to charity which I love. Overall, if you're looking for a cute \"cafe vibe\" with amazing food, bae baes is the place for you!",

The sauces they provide add great flavor as well. Very unique pairings. My three kids all found something they liked and it's not easy to please this brood. I wish there was a location in my town because I've been craving the food ever since we left.",

I wouldn't say it was outstanding but honestly the staff is friendly and the boba was pretty average. we took a bunch of cute photos which was a plus.",

Because it is located in downtown, parking is a problem but I am willing to walk a couple of blocks to eat their Korean fried chicken any time. The meal consists of protein of your choice, side salad, and a Korean side that changes daily. Personally I love the bulgogi and the chicken the best. This restaurant took some initiative to be green with having wooden utensils and paper straws. I don't mind paying a little more to enjoy a nice, hearty meal for $15. Would recommended 10/10.",

I had the spicy chicken with rice and veggie tempura and my boyfriend had the bulgogi with rice and kimchi. I was actually pretty surprised by the kimchi because as someone who only ever eats her mom's kimchi, it was pretty good. This place is on the pricier side but they give you a lot of food and you can tell that it's fresh. It's hot and tasty, and the variety of options is actually pretty intriguing.   The service was really nice and they were really attentive. Food came out pretty quickly. Atmosphere is really welcoming and relaxed. I love all the natural lighting and plants! I would definitely consider coming here again the next time I'm downtown.",

I don't like spicy things and was able to enjoy everything I ordered. Highly recommend the seaweed salad. I went with noodles but would probably opt for rice next time. Tofu was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Of course I topped everything off with a boba milk tea- always a fav! I'll be back soon and will be recommending to friends!",

They have succulents and terrariums decorating the concrete floored restaurant, giving the place a modern, dreamy vibe. It was my friend's first exposure to Korean food and I have only tried Korean food once or twice prior myself. The staff was helpful in explaining the menu and making recommendations.   Basically, you choose a protein (bulgogi beef, Korean fried chicken, spicy fried chicken, or fried tofu); a side of rice, salad, or glass noodles; and a small side like kimchi or fried vegetables (or some other options exist as well). Each order is also prepared with a small side salad.   My friend ordered Korean fried chicken, the glass noodles, and fried vegetables. I ordered the bulgogi beef, rice, and kimchi. My friend said the food was delicious and I definitely agreed! She said the fried chicken was some of the best she ever had, and I thought the beef was a real treat too! Normally I don't eat much red meat, but I definitely enjoyed this preparation with the unique sweet and savory flavor. Also, I have to point out that the bulgogi was the only non-fried option for protein, and the glass noodles are also fried, so if you have a stomach sensitive to fried foods your options become a little limited. I would recommend Bae Bae's adds another protein option that is not fried.   All of the foods a very nicely prepared and the presentation is lovely. My rice even came molded into a heart shape as decorated with black sesame seeds! The portions are moderately sized, and for the cost of the meal you are partially paying for presentation, location, and atmosphere so I do think it is worth it. Especially worth it if you are new to Korean food - if so, you will leave liking some new foods! Otherwise you'll just leave happy!",

The food comes in a to-go box... which you will definitely need because the portion size is huge!!! The food was delicious. The chicken bulgogi had a nice flavor and the noodles were good even though they were a bit greasy. I was glad that a salad was included because it helped to freshen it up! We also tried some of the bigger side options that did not come with the meal including a fried cheese soze  I really enjoyed the space. I sat along the front window surrounded by plants and was able to people watch! I would definitely return and try some other options.",

I don't enjoy eating meat often but the bulgogi was so tender and the owner comped me some veggies because I told him it was my first time there! The Vietnamese coffee was great too. Definitely stop there if you have time, a must-go if you're downtown for lunch.",

    "text": "This is an interesting and fresh concept to have as a downtown restaurant.  There aren't many options for Korean or Korean inspired food in the area, so I was excited to check Bae's out. They are open for lunch, and then close for two hours and open again for dinner.  I arrived right at 5 when they reopened and they weren't quite ready to be serving yet.  I was still able to order, but had to wait about 15 minutes for my food to be ready.  The staff told me it was because they were new and still getting the hang of things but then told me they had been open for nine weeks (so you think they'd be over growing pains by then).  They did give those of us waiting a few pieces of sweet potato tempura while we were waiting and that was a nice gesture.   I liked that they explained the concept and what each main dish and side were without dumbing it down.  I decided to try the beef with glass noodles and sweet potato tempura.  I wasn't blown away by any of it, but I did really enjoy the meal.  The tempura was probably my favorite part.  They were the right balance of crispy and juicy and had a wonderful flavor.  The glass noodles were just ok.  I though they were fairly bland.  The beef was tender and had a nice amount of flavor with a hint of sweetness.  If I were to visit again I'd probably try the pork belly instead. I was disappointed they didn't have the cucumbers.  Apparently they source them from someplace that doesn't currently have them available.   I did enjoy my meal and will probably visit again.  It was filling and a nice mix of flavors.  I just thought almost $14 was a bit steep for the portions that you got.",

I love going there with my friends because there's options for all of us and all our diets. The hospitality there is also unmatched, I always feel welcomed and at home from the owners and workers, who always address me and my friends by my name and are always so kind. Also very much a fan of how Bae Bae's does their best to use environmentally friendly alternatives for cutlery etc. I love Bae Bae's for their atmosphere and delicious food. I highly recommend!",

The interior and decorations inside make me feel like I'm in Narnia sometimes. That might sound a little too dramatic but you have to go there to feel the atmosphere. It's not your traditional restaurant with waiters and waitresses. It's kind of like a Chipotle, but the food is WAY better and you wont feel guilty about it. Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) is my go to protein. Dont be swayed by the \"fried\" aspect because it absolutely wont make you feel greasy and gross. Everything at Bae Baes is made fresh and is local, sustainable and organic. Their kimchi is SO GOOD and has the right amount of spice and tanginess. I can eat it everyday. What's my go-to order, you ask? Rice, KFC, Cabbage kimchi, with a side of spicy mayo. You will not regret it, trust me. Also, their cheese wontons are mouthwatering   Bae Baes is a little on the pricey side, but the amount of food they give you is WELL worth the price. GO TO BAE BAES ASAP!",

We waited for fresh noodles and pork to be made. I was very let down by my meal. I can't do very spicy foods and unfortunately you can't customize your order that way. The noodles were very spicy as was the pork which I couldn't even eat. I was not confident that the pork was fully cooked, plus it was mostly fat! I love Thai tea and I love bubble tea, together I was hoping it would be a nice treat but the beverage was watered down and tasteless. This place really let me down. I will say I like that they collect their tips and donate them to the Humane society.",

    "text": "Great little restaurant and takeout in Pittsburgh.  I ended up coming here twice during a three day trip. One for takeaway and one for a quick lunch with a group of people. There is a selection of bases, a main ingredient (chicken, tofu etc) and sides.  I ended up have the noodles as base both times, bulgogi, fried tofu, bean sprouts, and kimchi. The staff there was very friendly and patient in explaining the options (which I am sure they repeat all the time!). They even remembered me and my name on my second visit. Great local store to pop in for a healthier meal or take away - especially close to the convention center if you are there for work and just want a simple meal as opposed to dining out or room service.",

I chose glass noodles, two giant pork meatballs in Asian sauce, cucumber kimchi, and tempura sweet potatoes. The box also came with a side salad. The meal was enormous and worth the $12. I enjoyed the flavor of the sauce on the pork, but the actual meat could have been more tender and seasoned. The cucumber kimchi and sweet potatoes were both tasty as well. I thought about saving some for a second meal but I ate the whole thing. They had some other tasty sounding proteins like spicy fried chicken, pork ribs, tofu etc.. I will definitely go back. I was excited to see a new lunch spot added downtown.",

The plants definitely made the restaurant seem very hipster. I also really appreciated that the dining room was decorated with hearts, reds and pinks for Valentine's Day.   Food: 9/10: I ordered the bulgogi with the veggie tempura and also cheese wontons. The food comes in a cute box and everything was portioned well. There was so much flavor and texture to the food. I really liked how they included some greens to the dish to help further mix up the texture. The breading on the tempura was grainy and tasty. I was a little nervous that the tempura would get soggy by the time I got back to my office; I was pleasantly surprised when I felt crispiness still. The cheese wontons could've have been better in my opinion.  The sauce was very flavorful and I definitely felt the hear along with sweetness.  However, the wontons themselves were very crispy and filled perfectly.. I just wanted more somehow. I'm not sure if the wontons are worth $5.   Service 9/10: the service here is great! I appreciate how you order your food first at the cute little corner and wait for your food afterwards. I waited about 12 minutes for my food however, it was during the lunch rush. The man that helped me behind the counter was super smiley and answered the questions that I had. Once service slowed down, he even brought out my coworker's food to him and double checked whether or not I wanted a bag to carry it all.   Overall, I'd absolutely recommend this place. The place is vibrant and full of life. The customer service is great and I felt genuinely cared for and the food is very good!",

I walked in on a Wednesday about 10 minutes after they opened at 11:30am and there were already like 5 people in line! I could tell they were popular. The food was very good. I got their noodle bowl with tofu and veggies. I also got a thai iced tea. The meal was somewhat expensive, coming it at around $20 with tip. However it was very enjoyable and everything comes in biodegradable containers/forks/etc, which was a nice touch! Their food is also organic!   The atmosphere of the restaurant was soooo cute. They had small tables scattered through the front and back of the restaurant. You walked up to the counter to order and they called out your number when your food was ready. I took mine to go but ended up sitting right outside the restaurant in their community seating area. It was connected to the restaurant but open to the public which was a nice, community-focused, touch.   Overall, the atmosphere will take me back and I'll try a different protein in my next bowl!",

Bae Bae's has seating in the front and back and additional spots can be found at small tables in the front during the nicer times of the year. Bae Bae's has a nice modern/hip feel to it, but it's the food that keeps you coming back.  You can pick the rice, glass noodles, a protein (bulgogi, Korean fried chicken, chicken stir fry, or tofu), and a side which varies daily (although the cucumber kimchi is there everyday and it's awesome). The portions are very generous and the noodles are filling and delicious (I always get them). The bulgogi is perfectly cut, cooked, seasoned, and sauced and goes perfect with the noodles and salad. The Korean fried chicken is cooked and fried and two full breasts are served (plenty of food). The Korean fried chicken is also served with a honey wasabi which is served on the side and can be poured on or dipped.",

The beef is the least spicy of the meat options- it's really not spicy at all, but has good flavor! It was served with greens and then I picked the Napa cabbage kimchi as my side. The cabbage kimchi was good. The person working the register was very helpful in telling me about the meat options and in helping me decide what I wanted.

    "text": "YES. We need something like this in my hometown.  It's a great concept.  Quick Korean food.  Following in what seems to be the trend of \"building your bowl\" or in this case \"build your box\" type restaurants, Bae Bae's Kitchen is a great find in this area of the city.  I was staying at the Hampton Inn on Smallman, and this was only an 8 minute walk.  Considering the trend towards bars and higher end dining in general over here, I found this to be a welcome discovery traveling with my 18 year old charge.  First of all, when you enter into the restaurant, the smell of Korean food floods your nostrils and you're in culinary heaven.  I love that smell... and it's still in my nose now. (unless that's the leftover wafting over from the counter...)  I went with a rice, marinated beef, and napa kimchee combination and it was DELICIOUS.  There's nothing really more to say about that.  The flavors were strong but not overpowering.  The black sesame seeds add a hint of flavor that I always love.  Student went with the fried glass noodle, Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) and seaweed salad.  She wasn't in love with it, but reported that it wasn't too spicy, which generally means it's OK.  She also wasn't a fan of the plum sauce, as she felt it was too sweet.  It was a substitution for a wasabi sauce I suggested she not eat.  Thai tea for me with tapioca pearls to boot.  You also cant' go wrong there.  Student went with a milk tea.  Her favorite.    But by far my favorite aspect of our visit... the decor.  I called it \"cute\" to the guy taking our order.  But cute isn't really the word for it.  It's WHIMSICAL.  I loved the dainty, garden-like environs that transport you somewhere magical.  And the added touches for Christmas were apparent too.  So thoughtfully done.  I bet others think it could be overdone, but really, it's something beautiful.  I just wanted to sit there in the front window and enjoy the evening.    This location closes at 8, so if you're staying in a nearby hotel, plan accordingly.  But definitely check it out!",

    "text": "Got the fried crispy tofu with a side of veggie tempura over a bed of mixed greens (almost healthy, right??). The tofu was creamy on the inside and crisp on the outside - a very good fried tofu! I appreciate the chunky serving, too, as sometimes vegetarian food doesn't keep me as full. The vegan plum sauce they have over it tastes almost exactly like oyster sauce, which is a compliment in my book. The veg tempura was also tasty and decidedly distinct from Japanese tempura, though I wish I'd gotten a little more with my order. Altogether pretty good, if a slightly pricier option for Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "I am not one to have favorites but Bae Bae's Kitchen is, of recent, my UTMOST FAVE place to eat. Why you ask?  First of all, how dare you ask that --  Second of all, WHY NOT? Not only is this restaurant sustainable but it also accommodates to every lifestyle/diet!  As a new vegan, I seriously appreciate the options at Bae Bae's! It is especially hard to be a Korean vegan because fish/fish products seem to creep into every Korean dish (including kimchi) -- but Bae Bae makes it easy for me to pick what I want to eat.  [Food] My non-vegan friends and I went and created our own bowls. I got the tofu with plum sauce over glass noodles. The tofu is crispy on the outside and just the right amount of sweet each bite. The glass noodles are seriously addictive. Alongside the main meal, I was given greens, which perfectly cut through the heartiness of the meal with its freshness and acidity. The kimchi (vegan) tasted amazing. Personally, I found the portion sizes just right. There was enough food for me to get full without concern of food coma-ing. My friends agreed. They enjoyed their food as much as I did, if not more.  [Service] The people here are so frickin wholesome. They definitely put their hearts in their work. Each meal is packed with care. The cashier is super mellow and kind. Very patient. Everyone has a warm demeanor, very sweet.  [Atmosphere] The interior of the place has the power to heal souls -- the green life, lights and thoughtful decor make for a safe haven. I love the amount of care put into this place. They even put up Christmas decorations. You're bound to smile stepping inside. Bae Bae's even has outdoor seating (for warmer days, I'm assuming) and a cute little garden outside.",

    "text": "I work downtown and one of my co-workers kept referencing Bae Bae's and their \"addicting\" Korean fried chicken. All I can say is that I'm only upset I haven't eaten their food earlier in life.   The restaurant itself is cozy, quaint, and I love all of the greenery and mini terra cotta pots decorating the walls. In the spring and summer, there is an outdoor alcove where you can enjoy their food and take in the city's daily activity.  The food is simple but familiar, yet very difficult to describe to those who haven't tried. You can truly feel the love that is put into each dish. I had to drag my husband here on a weekend and now he never stops talking about their food as well.  My favorite items are the Korean Fried Chicken, their Bulgogi Mandu (a fried dumpling with bulgogi beef and japchae noodles), and their daikon radish Kimchi. My husband loves the handmade dumplings with chili oil and veggie tempura. I have not been lucky enough to try their featured desserts yet but I always walk away with an Earl Grey milk tea with bubbles in my hand.   I will say that I don't necessarily get to enjoy this at lunch given my personal work schedule but this is one of my favorite spots for an early dinner or a weekend lunch. They are also available through UberEats but I highly suggest you experience the food in person. There are some restaurants that speak to your soul and Bae Bae's is one of them.",

    "text": "Bae Bae's Kitchen is one of the few (if not only) Asian food place that's worth going to in downtown Pittsburgh.   It's a fast casual BYO (build your own) concept. You can choose either rice, noodles, or salad, protein, and a side dish. Each plate comes with a salad as well. The options that they usually have are bulgogi--a marinated beef, KFC--Korean fried chicken, and tofu. They also have specials which they'll post on Instagram!   My favorite is definitely the bulgogi and rice combo with whatever housemade kimchi they have on special. Literally sooo freaking good. They also have a lot of vegan-friendly options for friends who don't eat meat.   Also can we talk about the bubble tea there?? It's all house brewed and delicious AND they offer almond + soy milk for those of us who can't have milk. If you couldn't tell, I'm all around obsessed with Bae Bae's.  There is usually a line literally out the door, but the wait is worth it! The restaurant is super sustainably focused with wooden utensils and cardboard straws, and it's super cool to see a place in Pittsburgh really focus on that. The atmosphere inside is also really cute and dreamy with a ton of twinkling lights and flowers, so if it's not packed, I would actually recommend eating there. This is one of my staples in Pittsburgh and I definitely find myself coming back here all the time!",

My husband got the spicy chicken special with rice and the vegetable tempura. Milk tea to drink.   All of the food comes packaged to go, even if you are staying in. Everything was good.  They give you a little side salad with a light dressing on the side. The sauce on the beef was really yummy.   My only complaint is the prices, which seem a bit high.

The abundance of plants and lights throughout the store gives a lovely whimsical vibe to the dining experience.   The menu itself is pretty small as you base your meal around building a bowl with either salad, rice, or noodles. I got the stir fried glass noodles with veggies, crispy tofu, and vegetable tempura. The plum sauce drizzled over my bowl tied the meal together with its bursting flavor.   I came with a friend who is gluten-free and she was pretty satisfied with her meal as well since there were comparable options for her bowl (rice, tofu, kimchi, but no sauce).   No matter what you get, you will probably leave the store feeling full and content, knowing that you are eating local and eating healthy!",

It's very warm and welcoming in the restaurant. The staff is so friendly and knowledgeable.   I ordered the Korean Fried Chicken special with rice and tempura vegetables. This special also comes with a side salad. I also ordered a side of cheese wontons- everything was incredible. I also tried the beef wontons and they were also very good.   You gotta go & it out!

The fried chicken was a cutlet. For some reason I was expecting little Korean chicken drumsticks (gan bok ki). The chicken cutlet was tasty, but a bit dry. It could also use a kick. The bulgogi was good but not delicious. The sides were both excellent. Sorry, im being a little picky with the overall meat flavors.   They do have drinks in a cooler. I had the blood orange and my wife had the bottled green tea.   The overall price was to be expected.   I would give it 3.25 stars.

Like other reviewers have noted, it is a pretty tiny establishment and it gets very busy during lunch. While this is a great thing for the business, it can create customers to become antsy if service is slow.   My co-workers and I stopped in on a Monday at 11:30 when the doors opened. This is a food court style restaurant and you make your selections as you go. The menu isn't overwhelming which makes ordering less time consuming. I ordered the traditional Korean bulgogi and glass noodles. The beef was very tender and perfectly seasoned. If you are building your own plate, I would highly recommend choosing the bulgogi as your protein. The box comes with a side of bok choy and another side that you can choose. The bok choy was flavorless and they were out of cucumber salad. This was a little disappointing since it was a Monday morning and they should have been stocked up for the week.   Also, I would like to comment on the person that was preparing the boxes also had to cover the register at one point. There was someone different on the register, but she had to prepare a large order of milk teas and couldn't do both. This caused a back up because no one was preparing the boxes while he was covering the register. I think they have some kinks to work out with the service line, but overall I was pleased with my bulgogi.",

They clearly put a lot of work into decorating, there's adorable little succulent plants and lights everywhere. I built a plate with Korean fried chicken (so good, the skin was perfectly crispy. I tried the bulgogi and this was better in my opinion), which came with a wasabi dipping sauce, and glass noodles with salad. It comes with one side but the server gave me two, cucumber kimchi and potato salad! The server today was amazing, he was so friendly and upbeat and even gave us free sweet potato tempura because it wasn't available when we ordered. He also gave me extra boba in my Vietnamese coffee. Very happy with everything!",

    "text": "A cute little cafe vibe, the plants in the window and overall atmosphere make for a lovely place for you to eat your meal. There is limited seating, but the back of the store has seating with long tables that would be ideal for bigger parties. The menu is rather limited, but the components of each meal is done well and packs a symphony of tastes and flavors as you can mix and match a protein, a pairing (rice, glass noodles, or salad) and a side dish.  I chose the bulgogi with rice and a side dish of kimchi cucumbers while my friend chose the Korean Fried Chicken with rice and tempura vegetables. I also got a Thai iced tea and added boba to it (which they gave me plenty!). The fried chicken was moist and perfectly fried and the wasabi-honey sauce that came with it was good. The bulgogi was well marinated; however, my only complaint was that they added too many onions and not enough beef.   The next time I go downtown, I will definitely be coming back here to try the other choices!",

I go there a good bit, and my one complaint is that they often run out of things midway through the lunch hour. I don't mind, I typically will just get something else, but it would be nice to have more options. As others have said the line can get long, but I do think they work through it fairly quickly!",

My fault for expecting otherwise, I knew the photos looked too healthy!  Really small container of kimchi :( No kimbap, apparently that's made by owners whim, which is actually the reason I went. :(  Service was wonderful though, girl behind counter took the time to explain all the items.  My (katsu-like) KFC was made fresh with a cool wasabi-honey sauce.  It's nice but I'm team sweet-soy or gochujang KFC forever.  I think its a great place if you're looking for some lighter-fare or korean-vegan, which is rare.  Not for me though! I welcome diabetes.",

It was really nice walking in and being able to order from the menu freely! I love that everything is locally and sustainability sourced, no MSG, no preservatives, and no artificial flavors or colors.  I built my own bowl with noodles (Japchae), bulgogi (marinated grass fed beef), and cucumber kimchi as a side. My meal was absolutely delicious! I really like that the bowl is also served with a salad! Portions are very large as well. I packed the rest and it will be a nice snack. This meal really hit the spot! The sweet potato fries were extremely crispy and delicious. The pork and kimchi dumplings in chili oil was very flavorful! My only complaint was the dumplings were slightly over cooked and the dumplings were falling apart a little. I like when the dumpling skin has a bite. The employees were all very friendly and helpful! When I asked for hot sauce, I was offered Sriracha and their level 10 hot sauce. They also asked if my friends were Korean and offered us free kimchi!  If you are in the Pittsburgh area, I highly recommend Bae Bae's Kitchen!",

Headed here for lunch and got there around 12:00 sharp-- not wait in line at that time but quickly got busy as we waited for our food. Pretty standard downtown lunch rush. I got the spicy chicken with glass noodles and seaweed salad on the side. We also ordered the Korean fried chicken.   Spicy chicken: I got about a 4-5 spiciness, there is heat but not very hot in my opinion definitely prefer less heat than too much! Glass noodles were so GOOD. Side salad that comes with It good too-- needs more dressing it's a little dry unless you mix the entire box together  KFC: very good! Texture and chicken quality was great! Only complaint was It was an over-flavorful crisp outside which you didn't really notice if you mixed the bowl together.   Overall, good. Not the best thing I've ever tried but everything tasted fresh and relatively healthy. The interior can be a little cramped at peak times but wow was it so cute inside! The ambiance as amazing!!! I was definitely come back. It was a nice change in pace since I haven't seen much Korean food in Pittsburgh. Prices seemed standard for fast casual with the amount of food you get. Could be a little cheaper in my opinion but nonetheless still worth It.",

Granted, I went within the first couple of month of it's openings and things have changed according to some of my friends. You do get to pick a couple of sides and the whole presentation looks nice.

    "text": "I walked in here as soon as they opened at 11:30 and since this was my first visit asked directions as to how to order. Once led to the ordering counter I asked the man behind the counter if they had any gluten free items. He said \"no, are you celiac?\" I replied no but since my reviews are usually tailored to those with dietary restrictions I try to find out.  They do have many vegan options to choose from. This fast casual concept works pretty much the same as what I'm used to: Order a base, then a protein and then a side which is a condiment size container of one of 5 items sitting by the register. I decided upon a salad base but he talked me into getting either a noodle or purple rice base since my meal comes with salad anyway. I decided to try the tofu since it wasn't as spicy with plum sauce. I also ordered as a side the vegetable tempura. With that I ordered a passion mango fruit drink. Needless to say by the time I was done ordering there was a line behind me nearly out the door!  I was given a number and sat down at a table. They have a few tables up front as well as a few in the back. Outside they have a lovely garden veranda to sit under on a hot day if you prefer to eat there. They use semi compostable utensils-the straw and the fork. The knife I had was plastic.  All food is served in \"to go\" containers. When my number was called I got my two containers and was amazed at the size of the tofu. It looked like they were serving a whole box full of it similar to what I see at the grocery store. The tofu was good however very difficult to cut with that plastic knife. I truly enjoyed my side of seeweed salad and the salad that came with it. I must say the best thing I liked was that passion mango fruit juice. If it wasn't $4.00 a glass I would have bought another one.  The vegetable tempura was also good but since it was fried and covered in sea salt I could taste the spices. I used the soy sauce for dipping it to make it more enjoyable. The purple rice was well-just ordinary rice with a purple color and other things mixed in with it. The meal was a bit messy as well but they had plenty of napkins near their water cooler. On their chalkboard it reads that they source local, sustainable, and all natural products. They even separate your trash from your recycles.  This place depending upon what you get costs pretty much as what you may pay for an average sit down restaurant. This is a very popular lunch spot among the working but it dies down around 12:30 or so.  The good-plenty of vegan options and for the most part well prepared food. Nice outdoor garden and sitting area. The bad-no gluten free options available. A bit pricey. Long lines. Verdict-3.5. Located on the 900 block of Liberty Ave public transportation is available as well as metered and garage parking.",

They have a lot of plants and beautiful flowers decorated in and out of the restaurant. Part of the restaurant looks like a mini greenhouse! :D They have outdoor seating options as well as indoor, but it was way too hot to sit outside today.  All the utensils seemed to be biodegradable; the straws are paper and forks were wood(?).   You order like you do at Chipotle where you choose a \"base\" (rice, noodles, salad), a choice or meat, and a side.  I ordered the rice + spicy chicken + crab salad side and my husband ordered rice + KFC (Korean fried chicken) + bean sprout side. The sides are not that big - they just come in little containers. The food comes in a box with your order and a side salad with soy sauce-based dressing.  The taste of the food was YUM! The portion size was on the bigger side and everything we ordered was very flavorful and delicious.  It wasn't FULLY Korean though (you can definitely tell it's more on the fusion side than the authentic).   All the employees were very nice and friendly too. If I lived in the area, I'd definitely come back again!",

Although you do get a good portion, I didn't like the limited options. To me this meant that the food was probably premade instead of made per order which, since the food is ready so fast was nice, but felt the price was a little steep in consideration of this.  I'll definitely go back!",

I know I've used good way too many times in this review but it's just That Good. Choosing what things to get is always exciting.   The space is very cute too, clean with lots of natural light and a good plants and wood kinda aesthetic.   My only complaints would be that it can get a bit slow when you come at a popular time.",

    "text": "I've seen Bae Bae's kitchen on yelp quite a few times, but I've never gone to try it because it's right in the middle of downtown. Personally, I'd go here way more often if it were in another location (with better parking) because it's not really worth all of the work if you're driving. However, if I'm ever already downtown area for something I'll definitely stop back in. The food was really tasty and the service was excellent!   My first impression upon walking in was that it's beautiful! It's very modern and fresh which gives it a great vibe to sit in and enjoy your meal. At first, it seems small and cramped, but there's actually a back room full of seating too!   The service was excellent. Every single person was kind, helpful, and seemed actually happy to be there, which I don't find very often anymore. One of the employees figured out that we wanted to sit at a table that hadn't been cleaned yet, and she made a serious effort to get it cleaned for us. It was refreshing to see how dedicated they all were!   The food was really tasty. I ordered cheese wontons, and they were delicious (I'm a crab rangoon fanatic, so this means a lot). I also ordered the Korean fried chicken meal with purple rice, and the crab salad. The chicken comes with this wasabi honey sauce, which blew my mind. And the cheese wontons came with a spicy crab cream sauce, which I also thought was pretty good. The crab salad was okay, but I really enjoyed the chicken and rice much more. The sauces really pulled it all together nicely.  One thing I will say is that it can get a bit pricey. You're probably going to spend about $18-25 on your meal, which is a bit out of my comfort zone. I'd go here again if I wanted to splurge a bit, but there are several other more accessible and even cheaper places I could go with Great Asian food. I hope they open up another location!",

I'm not even the biggest Asian/Korean style food fan and they've converted me!   But in all seriousness, what a rootin' tootin' fantastic restaurant this is. I have gotten both the KFC (Korean fried chicken) and the spicy chicken. I love both, but the spicy chicken is my favorite. And when they tell you it's a 7/10 spicy, believe them! You may not think that at first, but by the next morning, you sure will. What a rush.  And do not get me started on their tempura. I didn't even know what a tempura was before Bae Bae's and now I can never look back. Sweet potatoes? Love them. Lightly bread them and back them? LOVE THEM EVEN MORE. Toss some broccoli and mushrooms in there and you've got the holy trinity.   They recently added quinoa to the white rice which made me nervous to change my habit, but gosh darn it they've done it again. They made me like QUINOA!   My only complaint about this place is that I can never seem to get it on food delivery services -- but it usually doesn't matter because I will risk my life to drive downtown anytime for Bae Bae's.   thank you Bae Bae, you scrumptious beast.",

The use paper straws and biodegradable utensils. The place is also very cute with a ton of plants. Lastly the food seems relatively healthy and fresh. My spicy chicken stir fry was pretty good and had some good flavor.  On he side of the cons, the food seemed to be lacking in flavor. The Korean fried chicken tasted very plain like it hadn't been seasoned. The side salad was also very plain and could use more dressing. The crab salad was ok but I wouldn't order it again and didn't even finish the little bit I was given.  Overall the food was ok but nothing special. It was nice that the restaurant was environmentally friendly, but for a little less than $20 a person it just did not feel like it was worth the price",

Yelp images led us to believe that Bar Bae's regularly has kimbap, however, it turns out they only served it for a short time as a special.   We were sorely disappointed since that is what we were hoping for, but instead we got a rice and bulgogi plate that was really tasty. The meat tasted just as expected and the other fixings with it were great too. We got a side of crab salad, good, but not amazing. My wife and I shared the meal and it was the perfect amount for us since we weren't incredibly hungry.   Our only complaints were just that the side was only about one forkful, and the meal seems a little on the pricey side.   Hopefully we'll be able to make it back soon for some kimbap!",

You instantly feel relaxed as you walk in and later nourished as you eat great food! Inside they have a range of seating options for different sized groups or individuals. One of my favorite things was their use of sustainable cutlery (i.e non plastic)! They use local ingredients (not sure if all ingredients are local but at least some are).   For my meal I ordered the fried chicken with noodles- it also came with a bit of salad. The portion was huge! I was able to save close to half for lunch the next day. You definitely get a great value for your money. Further, everything tasted SO good. I'd highly recommend getting the cucumber kimchi as the side.  I hesitated to go for a while because I was under the impression that this was only a vegan restaurant (could not tell you why I thought that) but they offer vegan, vegetarian, and meat options so a great choice if you have friends with specific food preferences.   Overall, I cannot wait to return and try more of their menu or reorder this meal. Go and try it for yourself!!!",

The tofu was delicious and had a great texture, while the plum sauce was sweet and complimented well. The japchae, salad, tempura, and kimchi were great components as well for a filling and well balanced meal. My lunch companion went for the KFC and japchae as well as a Thai iced tea. The chicken and tea were both made very well also, with the KFC being a very large fried chicken cutlet.  I saw they also had tasty looking sides such as bulgogi nachos and sweet potato fries, but we didn't have time to try them this time. Looking forward to going back!",

So enjoy it all you people who don't get sick off gluten!   The reason I'm disappointed is because I've talked to the owners multiple times about making items with gluten free soy sauce, and they won't do it. The first time I talked to someone they flat out said, we will never do that because it doesn't taste as good. Dude, I can assure you it will be delicious, I trust your cooking! The last time I talked to them, they said they're now carrying gluten free soy sauce aka tamari sauce, so to come on in. I was PUMPED!  I went up to the counter and the cashier told me the sauce only comes on the side, but they don't make any dishes with the GF sauce still. Why would you offer tamari sauce then? Seems pointless. I could be wrong, but my understanding from what he said is that everything is pre-made and/or marinated in soy sauce. So he told me I can't get anything without gluten except for the plain rice and tofu. Not worth my money. I want the delicious dishes they offer to regular customers!  The reason it's frustrating is because I go to lots of Asian places that can sub in gluten free soy sauce no problem. I actually go to the majority of restaurants in general and they accommodate no issue, with delicious food I might add! I don't want to be gluten free, I have to be so I don't get sick. I just hope at some point they change their minds. With 20% or more of the population having to go gluten free, I'm hoping someday they'll welcome us!",

As first time parents, we are always running around getting things, but our awesome cashier was thoughtful and took initiative to offer us a plate for the toddler to use - then when our stroller knocked our bubble tea all over the floor, they were kind enough to help us clean AND bring us a new one!    We felt terrible to put them in chaos right before the lunch rush, but the staff (especially our awesome cashier) were super helpful and he had a smile on the whole time - thank you again & again!    P.S. Food was awesome too, as living in NJ suburbia means we are always trolling for good/unique Asian food when in other cities.  Gotta try the tofu next time, but that wasabi dipping sauce was yummy, and our toddler loved everything from the Korean Fried Chicken to the veggie tempura (and he's a picky eater).  Thanks again!!!",

Our order came out pretty fast.The only issue was with the food, the tofu was cut into big chunks and was sweet. The offered us hot sauce when requested. The tofu tasted best with rice noodles instead of rice.   The place has great succulent garden and cozy ambiance to it. Not to forget great customer service.",

They are lucky that tourists from the convention center and visiting actors from the theater district don't know any better.  They see \"Korean\" and assume that it is a quality place.   Not to mention the prices...  Waaaaay overpriced for the Bland food. Capital B.   The only possible bright spot is the incredibly \"trendy\" and disagreeable snowflake workers, who make you wonder if you have annoyed them enough  by forfeiting your money for the crappy food.

I've been wanted to try it and have heard it's good. Today I came with my friend, and they really don't disappoint. We got there right when they opened on a Saturday, and booooy it's already packed. Popular place! We both got bulgogi and japchae. Not only their food was freshly made and delicious, but their customer service was excellent! The guy that served us was so sweet and helpful. Even though you only get one side, I couldn't decide which side I wanted he let me try one extra side. And we also got to try tempura sweet potatoes. By the time we sat down to eat, there was a line already. I am so excited to bring my other friends here. Also, this place is also dangerously close to where I live. Haha  Next time I want to try their Korean fried chicken or the crispy tofu! Oh my they both look amazing and they seem like the popular options too. It is safe to say I'll definitely be returning sooooon!",

    "text": "I hate to be one of the first to give this place a rating that isn't fantastic but I have to be honest about my recent experience. After my coworker and fellow yelper told me about a new place opening by work I was thrilled to check it out. After seeing the great yelp reviews and having someone stop me on the street to tell me how good it was, I thought for sure it had to be amazing. Sadly I was left very disappointing.  The place itself is definitely very small so this isn't a place for big parties. Food is served in to go boxes so I think the general idea is that most will take their food back to the office with them. The decor and atmosphere of the restaurant is very cute. What fell really short for me was the food and service. The staff was extremely slow serving and ringing out customers. Of course this place is new so that's expected as they work out some of the kinks but being part of the downtown lunch scene means you really need to get that part right so people can quickly return to work.   After much debating I ended up going with the KFC (fried chicken) with glass noodles. The chicken was cooked absolutely perfectly I will say but what really disappointed me most was the daily sauce they gave you with the chicken. It has a very strange taste almost like it had alcohol in it. It wasn't even edible in my opinion. The noodles were probably the best part of my lunch. One of the other things that sadly left me a little disappointed was the fact that they were just out of particular side dishes. I was extremely excited to try the cucumber kimchi and they didn't have any for that day.   With all of that being said I would probably give it another try and possibly go with the beef next time. I would still recommend everyone check it out because others seem to really like it and everyone has different opinions.",

Basically you get a full stomach but don't feel yuck afterwards...you feel energized and happy! I'm not really a woo-woo type but I think because the food is sourced well and made with care that contributes to the positive vibes.

You order to the left now and the food is the right. There is always a cluster of people waiting for their food to go. If you remember bring your own takeout bag! The food is good, but not out of the park for the price. Expect a $20 lunch. Everyone that works there is nice, which is refreshing being downtown. The Viet Coffee is my hands down favorite and the tempura sweet potatoes never disappoint. Eat there is you can, the food is so much better warm. The Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) is always delicious, but if you don't like wasabi (I think) then you have no sauce to eat it with. I've tried the pork belly and short ribs, both were good, still not sure they're worth $14-17 dollar with rice or kimchi as a side. Also they do not take tips, those go to the animal shelter, so I can't help but to donate every time I stop in!",

    "text": "Comfortable atmosphere playing American pop music. Spent $40. Summary is a fast food version of Korean food where they cut costs by using cheap ingredients and attempt to supplement for real ingredients while cheating the consumer with overpriced food. This seems to be the trend in Pittsburgh. We had the noodles with bulgogi and seaweed salad, the rice with (Korean Fried Chicken) KFC, sweet potato tempura, miso soup and a chamomile tea. Chamomile tea was $3.  Miso was comparable to the miso you can purchase at Walmart but bae bae's is $3. I personally think the out of the whole meal the sweet potato tempura was the best because of the creamy spicy wasabi sauce. Their KFC was chicken tenders with  Japanese breadcrumbs on it and tastes like the oil it was fried in with no seasoning. There was some honey wasabi sauce they added on the side but it did little to make up for the lack of effort placed in making the food. The seaweed salad was imitation made of cucumber (!) and was basically an attempt to take a short cut to make a base for their daily side the Crab Salad. The beef bulgogi had enough fat and tendon on it you might choke trying to swallow it (why did I pay for fat and tendon?) they also have half cups of iced tea. If you order one they fill it with ice and you may be fooled into believing you got what you payed for. Don't settle for the Americanized dumbdown version get the real thing at the Korean Garden in Shadyside or the Korean restaurant in Oakland.",

I got the beef, which was marinated in what I thought was too sweet a stew, with the glass noodles, seaweed salad, and they threw in a complementary salad and tempura sweet potato (yum!). It is a popular spot and sometimes they will sell out of some of their dishes (the pork was sold out, and people were waiting for the chicken to be finished in the kitchen).  However, in terms of satiating my Korean craving, it didn't quite hit the spot. The flavors were okay, but not great. I think next time I have such a craving, I'll go elsewhere.",

The menu is straightforward Korean food with no fancy tricks, just delicious cooking!  I ordered bulgogi over fried rice with a side of kimchi - it was delicious. As a bonus, they tossed in a sample of potato tempura, and that too was tasty. While I ordered my food to-go, I did notice how cozy the eatery was for dining in. I look forward to frequenting this spot and working my way through the menu. Good food, fast and friendly service. Bae Bae's kitchen is such a gem.",

The employees were very friendly in explaining what each dish was so you'd make the best decision.  I can't speak highly enough about the Tofu, crisp on the outside and tender on the inside, every place I've had Tofu at anywhere in Pittsburgh has been mush; this place did it right! The flavors are all on point, seaweed salad is well balanced and I would put the plum sauce for the Tofu on EVERYTHING if I could. The only complaint I have is how pricey the menu is and everything does seem to be fried.  I wish there were more non-fried options, but that will not deter me from coming here at least twice a month.",

I probably spent over an hour in here, but only a few minutes of that was actually taken up by me eating, haha. gave 2 stars instead of 1 because the atmosphere is really beautiful, and I *would* be willing to give this another try if i was downtown just based on how many positive reviews this place has! hopefully i just came on an off day.",

For vegetarians, they have a fried tofu option, but I was not overly impressed with the bland and unseasoned taste. It was fairly average quality food and portions were not enough to keep me full.   For a fast casual style restaurant, they still need to work on the fast part. The long lines are caused by the slow pace of getting people served. Since they're so new, they're probably working out the kinks. Another downfall is that they run out of food too quickly. I was there less than 2 hours after they opened and they were already out of half of their menu items.",

We stumbled upon this lovely gem when a few of us were looking for lunch after going to the Andy Warhol museum.  We had a wedding later that day and wanted something yummy but not too heavy.  First off, the owner is awesome!  So patiently answered all of our questions and didn't mind that we broke our order up into smaller orders so each person could pay for their own.  While waiting for our food (which came out pretty quickly), we were brought complimentary tempura.  Soooo good!  Lightly battered and fried.  I had the buns filled with chicken - although fried, the chicken was tender and still light.  The kimchi was perfectly spicy - not too over the top.  I also really enjoyed the potato salad side.  One friend had the pork belly buns and greatly enjoyed them.  The other had the boodles with pork belly and also enjoyed those.  If I find myself back in the Pittsburgh area, I will definitely pop back in for some more yummies.",

The place itself is very small/quaint.  I can see how it would be difficult to get a place to sit during peak times.  Since we visited after the lunch rush, there were several seats open.  We chose to sit at the table that faces the sidewalk and got to wave at several people peeking in the window.  All of the staff that we encountered were very friendly and helpful.  I ended up ordering a bubble milk tea, Korean Fried Chicken (so much for healthy!)with glass noddles & spicy crab salad.  We also ordered the crab wontons.  I really enjoyed the milk tea, noodles and spicy crab salad.  The crab wontons were excellent.  I really enjoyed the sauce that came with the wontons.  The chicken was cooked very well and was crispy and fresh, I just didn't really care for the sauce that came with it.    The meal was $12 by itself and I felt that a reasonable portion was provided.  My total bill was $21 when the milk tea and wontons were added.  I can't spend that on a lunch everyday, but it was a nice treat.  I will be back and will try some different proteins.",

    "text": "So we stop by last weekend during the Pride Festival. The storefront was closed, but they had a stand. The options were more limited than the menu, but we still tried. An order of glass noodles, wings, and Thai ice tea with boba. Noodles were great, wonderful flavor. Wings were basic and it was the spicy mayo that added the flavor. Not the Korean wings I'm accustomed to. Thai ice tea with boba was on point. All in all, it was pricey and above average. So why the five stars?   Well, go to the storefront! I found myself in the area the following Tuesday and the aroma won me over. I got the pork with rice special. At $10, it was much more reasonable than the festival pricing. The pork was so hearty and included a boiled egg, very much traditional Asian. It was quite sizable and I found myself with leftovers. Overall, the flavor was wonderful and vibe was fast paced but polite. Definitely come by!",

My boyfriend got the bulgolgi with purple rice and I got the Korean fried chicken with purple rice. We both got cucumbers as our side. My boyfriend also got the Thai tea with boba. All the food was very good and very filling. I'd definitely recommend this place and will probably stop by again if I'm ever in Pittsburgh.",

The menu is nice because you arent overwhelmed with options to choose from, mostly just the basics. The glass noodles are fantastic, but the real winner for me was the tempura fried vegetables. They were fantastic, I wish I had gotten more of them. Definitely check it out!",

I love the vibe in there! It's so cute! Everyone that works there is so nice and helpful! Being that it was my first time, I wasn't sure how to properly order (it's build your own) but the girl at the counter helped me with my selections. The guy behind the counter also seemed like a total sweetie!  I ordered the bulgogi, rice and kimchi cucumbers. It also came with some dressed mixed greens which made me happy because i wasn't sure i had ordered enough veggies! The bulgogi was good with sweet onions and scallions! It was a little bit greasy for me but I also think that is partially my fault for my selection knowing that I am not a big fan of greasy spoon meals. The cucumbers were awesome! And the greens were lightly dressed and refreshing!  I am definitely going to come back to Bae Bae's. I failed to mention there is a coffee bar and i got a really good iced latte! I may switch my order up but i was pleased overall!",

I now live in a small Midwestern city with no Korean options, so a 4+ star reviewed fast casual place with bulgogi a half block from my hotel after a long morning of flights seemed perfect. (Oh, how I miss eating in Minneapolis...) Staff were very nice, and the decor is beautiful. The music was a tad loud for my taste, but I'm pretty sound sensitive. The food, however, was so disappointing: the noodles and bulgogi were okay but bland and rather oily. I could taste what could have been an awesome meal, but the flavor was very weak. I don't think I would have been as bummed out if I hadn't had such high expectations, so be prepared for it to be less than the hype.",

My friend and I had one of each and I got tempura vegetables as my side along with rice. One thing is I did feel my rice was over cooked, it was all just really mushy. However, everything tastes really great. My chicken was fried super fresh and juicy, and his bulgogi has great flavors. I wish the chicken had more sauce options to add to it but I still enjoyed it. I only ate half and was able to save half for lunch the next day so while it was definitely pricey for lunch, I didn't regret it.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch on a weekday.  Ordered their glass noodles for the base, with fried tofu, and seaweed salad as my side.  Total was around $13.  What's Hot - Quality.  Yummers!  My fried tofu was nicely seasoned and tasted delicious.  For example, there was plum sauce, which added a nice flavor.  Their glass noodles and salad were good quality and fresh.  Their salad, that came with the dish, had a nice red pepper vinaigrette type of salad dressing, which had a nice tang. - Menu selection.  There are meats, veggies, and vegan selection.  Their fried tofu is a fried yuba (ie: tofu skins, which is thinner and has a nice texture).  They have bulgogi, sweet potato fries, seaweed salad, kimchi, chicken stir fry, etc...  It's pretty good and seasonal.  Their sides aren't the same all the time, because it depends on what they have in season.    - Portions.  It's a good portion size for 1 person.  They're not huge, but they're enough.  They serve all orders in takeout containers, which is nice and helpful if you don't eat there.   - Socially conscious/aware.  They have recycle bins for you to throw away your meal containers, plastic cups, utensils, etc...  It's great having a restaurant be environmentally friendly.  Additionally, any tips are donated.  What's Not - Layout.  It's a small seating area and it's not good for groups.  You can eat there, but it's easier finding seats and/or a table if it's a small group.  They do have a small outdoor seating area.  If your group is 4 or more, good luck.  Their service is geared for take out. - Price.  To be fair, they're not that expensive.  However, their meals only come with 1 side.  Any additional side is $1 each, which is expensive, given the small portions of the side.  As mentioned, my meals was around $13, which isn't bad, but it is kinda pricey for a single meal and no leftovers.  Any additional sides cost extra, as well, and it isn't cheap.  But this place is also more socially conscious, which comes with a price tag. - Wait time.  This place appears pretty popular.  They open at 11:30am and there were already people waiting outside when I arrived.  My point is to be aware that the popularity effects how long you're waiting in line and to get your food.  Final Answer Would definitely come back, but mindful of the time of when to go.",

There were several events going on downtown so everything was a bit more crowded than usual. However, my hubby still said the line wasn't that long. He is in lines like this during the lunch hour and he is in and out. Unfortunately that was not the case on Friday.  We ordered relatively quickly despite the long line around 6:20pm. We then waited almost 40 min for our food. For a place that really is take out that is ridiculous. They really only rushed on our food after we waited 30 min and my hubby went up to ask the status bc we have a 19 month old that needs to eat. The girl at the front said there were 2 Julia's that ordered. Im really not sure what that meant. Were they confused how much longer? Were they just not feeding anyone named Julia? They then gave us our rice we had ordered for our daughter but we waited an additional 10 minutes for our food.  Honestly I wouldn't be so mad about this if MANY people that came in after us had not come and gone with their food so quickly. We ordered two items that were a special so surely we weren't the only people in 40 minutes time that ordered the special?  Anyways- I ordered the spicy chicken with rice and tempura vegetables. It was good but was definitely super spicy. I'm not sure when or if I will be back due to the bad experience. My hubby keeps saying to give it another try.  I would give 2 stars due to the experience but the good food brought it up a star.",

They even have bubble tea, which is a treat!   You can build your own box, as well, and they give you really great sized portions. It's a little pricey for lunch, depending on what you get, but worth it! Everyone who works there is very nice and friendly.

    "text": "We tried this place for an early lunch last week. The food was all super fresh and flavorful. I had the bulgogi chicken with noodles and kimchi. The kimchi was pretty standard. The noodles had good flavor, but were a little greasy. The chicken was really good, but I hear that the fried chicken is the best option here. I will have to go back and try that sometime soon.   The interior of Bae Bae's is super small, so if you want to sit to eat, you have to be lucky or get there early. Everything already comes in to-go containers, so if you are looking to take something with you, this is a great option too.",

It was very greasy and tasted bland. The kimchi was ok, not the best I've had. I don't really like how they put the food in to go boxes either, it just gives me this weird vibe- like they want you to hurry up and leave or something. I felt kind of rushed while I was eating. I understand that Bae Bae's is a fast casual restaurant, but I wish they had actual plates for guests who want to stay and dine.   The price for the food is somewhat expensive, as it's $13 for mediocre bulgogi. I wasn't highly impressed with Bae Bae's, as it's supposed to be \"healthy\" but is their definition of \"healthy\" greasy meat and tempura? I'm not so sure if I want to come back again, but I did enjoy the plants in the restaurant and friendly staff.",

There were vegan options which what drew is here. We ordered a Create Your Own bowl/dish with tempura and tofu and plum sauce that includes kimchi and we selected both the rice and noodle base for three orders. The food was good and stood out from the standard Korean food that we all know and love with their own unique twist that experiments with the flavors. I wish they had the salad greens have more flavor like sesame oil and soy sauce or something to make it stand out. A little pricey considering the portion received but it was overall a great experience. I hear the worker singing in the back room as I am writing this review. Glad we were able to try this place while passing through Pittsburg!",

Food: Balance and delicious, not excessive use of oil. Not salty, not bland, just balance. Feels like you are eating clean food, not the typical Korean restaurants food.   Price: wowee a tad pricier, ordered 2 orders of the plate, 4 pieces of dumpling, and 2 bottles of tea came out to be $40. Great thing about it actually, no tips! They accept donation.

As a Korean working in Pittsburgh for a project, I didn't expect to be able to get my Korean food fix downtown but I go to this place at least once every week for lunch. As regulars, my coworkers and I have tried most of their options and are never unsatisfied. They've changed some menu items after the new year and I'm even more excited! For people trying it out for the first time, I'd definitely recommend the noodles and either the beef or chicken option. Their fried chicken is always perfectly crispy and the honey-wasabi sauce that comes with it is amazing. They've also come out with a new braised short rib option that just seems to melt in your mouth. All their side dishes are great too - I love their napa and cucumber kimchi because it tastes like it was really made by loving Korean cooks ~ The people there care about all of their customers, the space is quaint but wonderfully decorated, their beverage options are also awesome (try their bubble tea!) and their portions are generous. They always give you complimentary tempura with the plates, which are also always perfectly fried. The service might be a tad bit slow but it's worth it to support a local business and eat some authentic Korean food. Thanks, bae bae -",

Lines can get long (because word is spreading about how good it is) but the staff are always friendly and quick. And sometimes they offer little extras with your meal. Today the cashier asked if I liked sweet drinks and gave me a free sweet tea to enjoy. It's on the higher end for me pricewise for a fast casual spot but I think for the quality of ingredients, taste, and all of the different things you're getting (protein, carb, salad, side, tempura veggie) it's totally worth it.",
