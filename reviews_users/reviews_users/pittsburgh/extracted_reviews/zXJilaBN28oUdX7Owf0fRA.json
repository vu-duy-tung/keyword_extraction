    "text": "We like this place as a standard sushi restaurant in Squirrel Hill.  It's close to home, and the prices are pretty even-keel with other sushi places in the Pittsburgh area, and you can also get takeout.  The sushi is great, however, there are really not a lot of selection on special or unique rolls.  If we could do half-stars, I'd give it a 3.5, but I'll round up because they consistently make your typical sushi rolls quite well.  On our latest visit, we had a great waiter who was prompt with delivery of the food, and he also would refill our hot tea, but we had a really hard time getting refills on our water.  Unfortunately, with the saltiness of sushi and soy sauce, we kind of needed frequent refills on that, so I felt like I chugged a gallon of water right when I got home.  We tried something new this time, which was the 'first date roll,' a shrimp tempura roll with spicy tuna on top.  We loved this one, as it was a good example of something unique they can do.  The miso soup was also top-notch.  I would recommend this place if you're looking for good, standard-issue sushi.  We typically prefer Pacific Ring in Squirrel Hill, because they've made a lot of unique (and Pittsburgh-themed) rolls to spice things up, but this is a good second place.  I'm also a big fan of the wavy cups they serve your hot tea in, and they do have a wine list, although we have yet to try it out.",

There are a lot of places for improvement but as far as the sushi scene in Pittsburgh is concerned, Sakura is doing great!  They have one of the best variety of rolls I've seen in Pittsburgh. Usually whenever I go somewhere new and order sushi I stick to my usual, the dragon roll. At Sakura I'm always trying something new. Their menu is so extensive and creative that I don't usually even bother with the typical staples like salmon, or tuna rolls (although they are good too). I'm all about their interesting and unique rolls, the list of which is always growing. Some of my favorites include the Godzilla Roll, Red Dragon Roll, and the Spicy-Tuna rice sandwiches (I forget the exact name...) Also, they usually have a weekly special (not that it really ever expires... you can always order these even off the menu). This is how I found my real favorites, the Monkey Roll, Earth Roll, and best of all the Ocean Roll.   My only complaint is that the prices are a little steep, but I think for the quality it's worth it. I don't know about how their other food is aside from sushi, but the sushi itself is great. Don't let the unattractive outside facade fool you, this place is great and relatively quiet on the weeknights, so go then if you want faster service.",

We also had miso soup which was tasty but not earth shattering.  My husband had a dragon roll and a sunshine roll - the sunshine roll was charred on top and it lent a burnt flavor to the sushi.  The dragon roll was OK - but not great.  I had chicken and broccoli.  The chicken was tender and the broccoli appropriately al dente but the sauce was thin and lacked flavor.  The server was a very young girl who looked to be about 17 or so.  She was running around like a chicken without a head but there were only three tables in the restaurant.  I asked her if there was shrimp in the gyoza and she didn't know.  She had to dash back to the chef to ask - she just seemed so utterly overwhelmed.  The restaurant itself is dirty and desperately in need of updating.  My water glass had lipstick on it that wasn't mine.  The sushi menus on the tables are filthy!  The tables and chairs are rickety and the chairs are really uncomfortable.  The chairs scrape on the tile floor when you move them and they make a lot of noise.  The staff didn't even care when we left.  I really don't think that this is a place that bears returning to.",

There is always a friendly face and they are always nice, quick to order and helpful with suggestions.

    "text": "I have only ordered out from Sakura. The place is always drab and empty no matter what time it is. The staff are always sitting around doing nothing. It really sucks to go in the restaurant. Their \"hibachi\" is a freaking joke. Do not expect to get normal hibachi dinners here, in fact, expect absolute crap! Their \"regular\" Asian menu is joketasiticly inferior to many of the other Asian choices in Squirrel Hill and cost almost the same. The staff seem nice, but jump when any customer walks through the door as if they are not expecting anyone. Now (and please excuse any conceived racist under tones. I assure you I am just stating pure fact), I have had my order screwed up over the phone almost every time I order from Sakura. I understand that you do not need to speak fluent English to take a delivery order, but you should know the menu. Yesterday, My wife and I ordered from there (very inexpensive for a weekday meal) I ordered my sushi correctly, even going over my order 3 times with the woman on the phone. When the food arrived(promptly), our bill was for $70!!!! And as if fleeing from the scene before we could find out, the delivery guy didn't give us a receipt. Upon opening my order, I found that they had quadrupled my order AND CHARGED ME FOR IT!!!!! I called to complain and the woman, who I could barley understand refused to accept that she made a mistake. I became a bit belligerent and she called over her manager. All I could hear was him explaining something in Japanese and the phone girl going \"OOOHHHHHH?!\" over and over. She DID make a mistake and I was awarded free sushi and my money back. Still, when I said I would be there tomorrow to get the proof of the credit to my card, she initially refused!!????? The manger in the background must of shaken his head or something because she finally agreed. All I want is my damn food for crying out loud!!!!!!!!! But...  Their sushi lunch specials are the best I have ever seen. for $3.99 you have your choice of 6 different kinds of rolls; great for a late day snack (you can order up until 3pm). But...  This is another sushi place that claims to have tuna rolls when they are Fatty tuna rolls, but charge for regular lean tuna. Also order early or you WILL get stuck with day old, been-sitting-around-all-day, hard fish. But...  Get them on a good day or early in the day and you will have adequate sushi for a competitive price.",

    "text": "The sushi was good. We ordered a salmon roll, yellow tail roll and eel roll. There was nothing spectacular about any of them. The rolls were all a bit small compared to my normal sushi spot.   The udon is s different story. We got the shrimp and vegetable. First there were only 3 shrimp in the whole bowl. Once we tasted the shrimp we both were unhappy. It had a very off taste and texture. The broth was very bland and there was more vegetables than noodles.   With all of the different Japanese restaurants in town there is a lot of variety to choose from. We will not be returning here.",

    "text": "The vast chasm between the 5-star reviews and 1-star reviews of this place is very interesting... but my one and only experience with this place is ZERO stars.  I ordered sushi for delivery, and it arrived quickly, but the order was made incorrectly-- didn't even come close to matching the menu description. No avocado, no green onion, AND no cucumber in the roll, and the wrong sauce. This was an expensive fancy roll with only 2 of the 5 listed things inside and a massive amount of rice to make it look big. I immediately called the restaurant to let them know, and the \"owner\" (she insisted she was the owner) spent 11 minutes telling me \"that's just how we make it now\" ... I explained that the roll was far from matching the menu description, didn't contain the full value of ingredients I had paid for, and that this situation needed to be fixed. She literally just kept saying \"that's how we make it now\" and for a while tried the tactic of telling me that there WAS avocado on it, I just couldn't see it bc it was such a small slice.... yeah... there was not avocado anywhere in or on the roll. I repeatedly asked to speak to a manager or supervisor but she said she was the owner. So then I asked for her name and she straight-up refused to give me her name, numerous times. I finally realized I was arguing with an actual insane person, so I gave up. If you're ever thinking of ordering from here, just throw $15 into the trash instead.",

She really enjoyed the tempura and edamame.  I recently had some sushi and some Chinese delivered to my house.  The sushi was great and did not disappoint.  My daughter enjoyed her chicken with broccoli, as well.  Now that I know they deliver, I may be frequenting this place more often.  They are fairly priced for both Chinese and Japanese dishes.

I also had never felt like I was robbed by a restaurant until walking out the door at Sakura.  It would have been fine if the problem was just that the sushi was terrible.  But on top of the sushi being terrible, the chef also found it reasonable to exchange most of the fish that we ordered in our sushi with cucumber.  Instead of eel and cucumber? Try cucumber with a hint of eel  Want some tuna? Too bad. More cucumber.  I could have asked for them to put more fish in it, but it was so bad there was no point.    I paid 60 bucks for a bowl of Udon that will give me nightmares and a forest of cucumber.  Take it from someone who is far from a food snob - just skip this place.",

    "text": "Forget about whether or not the reviews here say the food is good or bad, forget about the pepsi being flat or the fish being warm. What you need to know is that upon receiving my take out container tonight from Sakura, I opened my package of chopsticks. Upon opening the container, chopsticks poised to snatch my first piece of sushi... something caught my eye. A seed? A burned grain of rice? No. A COCKROACH. A live cockroach. In my take out container.   As I jumped back from my dining room table, horrified and already scrambling for my cell phone I dialed Sakura and spoke to a manager who only said 'Oh. Sorry' and then hung up on me. I drove back to Sakura from my house with the take out container stretched as far away from me as possible. Into Sakura I ran, and then I stood. And waited. For a good three minutes while the 'sushi chefs' stared at me, I stood there with my container at arms length. Finally I leaned in towards them and said 'I don't think you want me to yell the reason I am here, please get me some help'. Nothing. Not an acknowledgement, not a person running to whisk me away from the other patrons, nothing.   I cleared my throat. \"I am here to return my sushi because there is a cockroach in it. Please someone help me.\" I said, just loudly enough for other people to here. Magically a manager appeared. Funny how that happens.   Now let me tell you what these sleazy dirtbags did. As though finding an intruder in my sushi were not enough... not a piece of wilted lettuce or a dirty wrapper or even a dangerous piece of plastic or glass, no- this was a LIVE disease bearing, egg laying BUG... but as though that were not insult enough- this 'manager' proceeded to refund my money MINUS the tip my husband had left for the sushi chefs.   Back that truck up, you say? That's right. I had to REQUEST that she refund my tip... \"because surely you don't think I am going to tip these men for sending home a COCKROACH?\" I asked her, and she simply said 'I'm sorry' a dozen times before I left.   I can deal with flat pepsi. Chairs that creak, wait staff that leaves something to be desired. I can deal with take out places that say 15 minutes when they really mean 45. I have eaten my fair share of things that weren't up to par, weren't what I wanted or were just plain bad... but what NO customer should EVER have to do is check their food to make sure that LIVE COCKROACHES aren't infesting it. And if you eat at Sakura that is EXACTLY what you'll have to do.",

We ordered breakfast items to share: 2 bowls of hot soy milk ($1.50 each), a stick of fried dough (1.25), chicken and thousand year old egg congee ($3), jellied bean curd ($3), and pork buns ($3). We left feeling a little stuffed, but the meal really hit the spot for me. The soy milk was subtly sweet, the dough was crisp and warm. The congee was really delicious. There were only very small pieces of chicken and egg, but I loved the intense ginger and scallion flavor. The jellied bean curd was a little on the salty side for me, but I still enjoyed it. The pork buns weren't anything special, but they were decent as well. My boyfriend happily downed everything. Overall, a really delicious breakfast that made me feel better about not visiting Taiwan this year. Another great Chinese restaurant in the area!",

We used to love the chinese bbq pork sandwich, but now it is dry and bland and even looks completely different (different bun and meat cut). The yang rou pao mo (shredded lamb and pancake soup) is a Chinese classic, but is no longer the dish it used to be. Now, the stock does not taste like it was properly made and the flavor is pretty underwhelming. We also got the hot oil noodles, the and the Chinese name escapes me, but it's supposed to be wet and oily. Not being authentic would be okay, but it was really dry and the texture of the noodle was awful. No flavor except your palate feels completely overpowered. There was one other dish, but it was so not memorable I don't even remember what it is. We only barely ate half our meal. Just... nothing was right.  The waitress was polite at first, but when we inquired about the noodle dish, she said she didn't know, and that's the way it was supposed to be. We were surprised but didn't send it back because I don't think it could be improved upon anyway... but afterwards, she seemed to tend to any of her other 3 tables (the only other 3 in the restaurant and she didn't seem swamped at all) except for ours, though we were clearly trying to get her attention for boxes and our check and leave. There was a clear change in quality of service, for reasons I can't understand.   Worse food and service... I wouldn't mind a change, but this is not a change for the better. With How Lee next door, save yourselves the trouble. Granted, this is really a review of the food they used to advertise as authentic, which has stayed advertised as so on the menu - but none of it tastes right (or good) anymore.  I would give this a 1 star, but +1 for benefit of the doubt for their sushi and Americanized-Chinese menu.",

    "text": "The only reason I'm not giving this place one star is because I went with a group of 5 other people and two people were pretty happy with their dishes. One guy got the small chicken fried rice and said it was a good deal. Another person got the large lo mien and had enough leftover for her packed lunches for the next few days. I have to give it to them, the quantity of some of their dishes is large.   However, the quality is seriously lacking. I got the dumplings and pork bun. They said the dumplings were homemade on the menu, so I was pretty excited about them, but I've definitely had better; the dumpling skin on some of them was a bit dry and tough.   Have you ever wished you could go into the kitchen of a restaurant and help them make the dish better? That's how I felt about the pork bun. It looked like they had all the ingredients needed to make a good pork bun, but what they served was an oily mess. I could only eat about a third of it before I had to stop because it was too bland to justify slurping down that much oil. I think this meal goes down in my books as the worst Chinese food I've ever had at a restaurant.",

The pieces of sushi were so small that all 18 pieces fit on a small tray that usual holds MAYBE 8. I sent my husband to Trader Joes to go get a 25 piece tray for $7. The quality was the same...  DO NOT GIVE A HORRIBLE BUSINESS LIKE THIS YOUR MONEY!  Edit: Wow, it got worse... after my husband got back from Trader Joes and we sat down to eat, it turns out that they completely got the order wrong - cucumber rolls instead of tuna rolls. It took a 10 minute phone call to get them to 1, believe us, 2, admit they were wrong, and 3, to refund the money. HORRIBLE service.",

Also because the owner and I have become familiar with each over the last three years my boyfriend and I have been frequent patrons there.   I have explored much of both their japanese and chinese menus, but tend to stick to the sushi menu whenever we go.   Not the best sushi I've ever had, but certainly my preferred place to go in Pittsburgh.  Usually order yellowtail roll, scallop roll, spicy tuna, salmon skin, white tuna sushi. When we go for specialty rolls, we order USA roll, Godzilla roll, and recently discovered the super delicious Sunshine roll.   Service is friendly and attentive, but usually when we go, it's very empty, so we just eat quietly at our table.   Also ordered some deliveries time to time as well, but it's not as fresh as eating in.",

Service: Even though sometimes I do see young kids serving us and doesn't look super professional in serving, but hey they are at least very kind. Like VERY kind.   Parking: easy to park on the street or the streets in the neighborhood.   Overall: this place is nice and clean. Good price for a lot a lot of food. And I like the kind people here a lot ;)",

I ordered at a little after 8:30, and the driver was knocking at the door less than 20 minutes later, food in hand! For a hungry person with cravings, that is definitely something worth commending. The previous delivery orders have also been consistently timely, albeit that was the first time being less than 20 minutes.  As far as the food, I can't say that it is especially delicious or awful. It's sort of more...comforting and dependable, hitting the spot when needed -- and that is what will keep me ordering from them.",

I love sushi, and I know who's good and who's not so great in Pittsburgh. It's very good. The quality of fish is excellent, and they have a nice variety of platters and specialty rolls. We tried a lot that day, and liked everything.  Today I was in the mood for something hot, as the summers coming to an end and tonight is almost jacket weather. The owner, Ping Geng, came up to my table and showed me a menu with traditional Chinese dishes on it. I literally just drove back into town from Toronto's Chinatown earlier today, and eagerly wanted to try something traditional offered locally.  Everything was excellent, from the eight treasure spicy sandwich, to the scallion puff pancake, to the BBQ pork sandwich to the house made dumplings.  In addition, there's a Chinese brunch menu offered on Saturdays and Sunday's from 10am-1pm that I'm very interested in trying.",

There's nothing really extraordinary about an Avocado roll and tomago in general because they might be some of the most basic options at this restaurant, so I measure their stars by consistency. I can expect the same amount of sweetness in the tomago, the correct level of ripeness in Avocado and the same portion sizes overall. These are really important for me! Their prices are also reasonable across the board for high-quality food.  I will continue to order from here and dine in whenever the craving strikes! I recommend it if you're in the area or want consistent quality.  I know I said consistent a million times in this review, but at least I'm consistent! ;)",

I got my standard sushi selection along with soup, steak hibachi, and they threw in a pork sandwich (unusual but ok) for free. Showed up on time & complete...all the food was good (better than average I'd say), but this pork sandwich....o.m.g. incredible. It was this crispy, flaky, buttery (but not soggy) crust filled with small pieces (almost ground up) of flavorful pork that wasnt dry or tough, etc. I have never had anything like it...the closest would probably be some type of breakfast croissant sandwich, but this was much better.   I'm really looking forward to trying their other Laotongguan dishes!!",

Their noodles are chewy and thick so if you're expecting thin, not the right place. The noodles are satisfying and perfect. When we went a lot of people had hot pot so it seems popular.   We also ordered the peppercorn chicken. It was spicy and even had some fried potatoes (fries) in it (definitely in Pittsburgh!). The owner told us there were bones but we decided to try it anyway. The bones are slightly annoying but the flavor is good although slightly saltier than we are used to. However, it's balanced out by eating the chicken with white rice which comes with the dish.   Restaurant is no frills and has plenty of seating for an intimate or large crowd. The service is very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our dinner.  Note- we did get an appetizer of white tuna sushi. I wouldn't go here just for the sushi. The star is really the hand made noodles!",

    "text": "I took my partners here for a special dinner. We decided we hadn't had sushi in a while, and this was the closest place.   FOOD we ordered: -1 order of the shrimp tempura appetizer. It was like $7 and had only 4 pieces of shrimp. Not a good deal.   -1 vegetable tempura appetizer. The vegetable tempura was a better deal, $5 for around six larger pieces of tempura. Sweet potato, bell pepper, broccoli, eggplant.   - 1 rock n roll ROLL. Very tasty and sweet. Like a dragon roll in reverse.   - 1 dragon roll. Very tasty and sweet. Exact ingredients as a rock n roll roll.   - 1 first date roll. This was the star of the show!  It was the table favorite. Crunchy tempura shrimp inside, spicy tuna outside. Smothered in sweet bbq eel sauce.   - 1 rainbow roll, also known as a caterpillar roll, where I am from. It's primarily various raw fish, avocado, and crab inside. It was just okay. Good enough. Better with a little wasabi.   - 1 Pittsburgh roll. What the hell even was this roll? It was just crab paste or something. It was boring.   - 1 spicy tuna roll. It was creepy how grayish pink it was. Spicy and fishy. Two of the three of us liked it a lot.   ----- A note about the SOY SAUCE: don't use it!  Something tasted really, really off about it. It seemed gross and not flavorful.  I couldn't make it taste better with wasabi-- I've never had such strangely bad soy sauce before. Luckily, I ordered rolls that mainly had other elements to moisten them, so it was fine.   Ambience- the place was empty on a Saturday around 6pm. Seemed like the family who runs it was just hanging out at the bar. It's not an upscale establishment. The bathroom smelled like someone accidentally dumped a whole bottle of bleach, and the eating area also smelled faintly of bleach, as a result.   Service. We were quickly given water and our server, a femme with glasses, was very attentive and polite.  ---- Overall, for sushi, it was just okay. I've lived in California and Hawaii, and have high hopes and standards of sushi. Some of the rolls here are overrated and overpriced. If you can learn what the good deals are here, or if money is no issue, it's an okay place for sushi for Pittsburgh.",

We like the sushi just fine, but the hand cut noodle dishes are just outstanding! Huge portions (always enough to take home), and unexpected flavors/textures. We love the sour vinegar-y sauce that came on the hot oil noodles with chicken (warning: EXTREMELY HOT. We're talking chili spice not Sichuan spice here.) and the texture of those noodles is like nothing else. Super chewy and fresh, so obviously homemade. I might ask for a knife next time because the noodles in my dish were *literally* a foot long! Very fun, if a little unwieldy, to eat. We also really love the staff here. There is a man who is clearly one of the owners who recognizes me and my husband and our two kids when we come in and always with genuine warmth and welcome. He happily strains the tofu and seaweed from my daughter's miso broth (picky eater!), and remembers the last thing we ordered. If we order something new, he has no problem telling us, \"no, you'll like this one better,\" and he is ALWAYS RIGHT. That's because he's paying attention to his customers. I would eat anything this man put in front of me without hesitation.Truly can't say enough good things about this wonderful spot!",

We were the only patrons in the restaurant - a few other folks came in when we were ready to leave.    They have about 4 different sushi menus, a paper one along with 2 specialty rolls lists - so we had to ask what was in a few rolls because the menus weren't at our tables.  Our waiter was great though - very attentive.   The trouble came when the soy sauce was brought to our table.  Silly huh?  Soy sauce ruined the meal.  I recognize not everyone uses soy sauce, but we did/do.  There are some soy sauces that are sodium filled and gross.  This is what they served.   I first noticed something was wrong when i began to put soy sauce in our bowl - it was so dark, almost black.  I stuck my chop stick in it, tasted it to find it was that super cheap soy sauce.    It ruined the meal for us.  $60 worth of sushi wasted.  Packaged up to go to use our own sushi with.  There are 2 stars because the wait staff was great. The 3rd star is - this is merely my opinion on taste. But they definitely need to upgrade their soy sauce.",

The soy milk was not so great. It's like Chinese tapas almost. The food is really authentic.

There was 3 bills and we tip according to the service. Remind you the bill he said he didn't get a big enough tip on he made the sushi wrong. So of course that came of out his tip. But to tell someone how to tip is bullshit. I work in the the service industry and I can't tell someone how to tip.

I suggest paying the fee to park behind Dunkin.   Service: The lady that runs the counter is authoritarian and rigid. No pleasantries.  Food: Terrible, I have tried their sushi 3x. Each time more expensive than the previous. The rice is dry and not evenly applied, the masago could actually be counted and less than 20 on a $17 six-piece roll. I got a tiger roll. Outside jumbo tiger shrimp was a flap of cold old shrimp. The pineapple chunk was enormous and over represented the flavor of the rest. The whitefish inside was a fried fishstick. And again the masago was so few and far between, it was a disservice to put to put it on in the first place.  Overall- 3x disappointed. My fault for coming back. This is the worst sushi in the city.

Our waitress, who seems to also be an owner, was very brash and direct, as if we were disrupting her peace, but we eventually warmed up to her.   As we sat down, we were offered the sushi and American menu. We were still flipping through those when we were handed the Chinese menu which is more extensive and has more traditional Chinese dishes. My boyfriend came here on a mission to try the Qishan noodles (thanks to a previous Yelp review!), which was only on a Specials menu that the waitress brought out afterwards. My goodness, how many menus does this place have?!  My boyfriend started with the Amazing Fire Roll ($13 - pretty darn expensive), which he claims is one of the best sushi he's had in Pittsburgh, second only to Ginza in Bloomfield. He's the biggest sushi snob on the planet, so if he loves it, it has to be good. The portion size of the Qishan noodles ($12.95) was HUGE! It was a noodle soup with what looked like lo mein noodles, shredded pork, and vegetables. The ratio of noodles and pork to broth were evenly balanced, a definite plus. Overall, he really enjoyed the noodles and highly recommends it.   They offer MANY different vegetarian options, but I was feeling less adventurous and went with old reliable: General Tso's Tofu. I found it strange that it was $10.95 on the American menu, yet it was $6.95 on the Chinese menu AND it came as a combo. (Favoritism perhaps?) When the vegetable soup came out, I was thinking to myself \"Gee, thanks for the bowl of....water\", but it was surprisingly VERY delicious! After devouring that in about 10 seconds, I pounced on the tofu. It came with a side of broccoli, daikon topped with a chili paste, and bok choy. The tofu was very crispy (a major requirement), and the sauce was delicious with the perfect balance of sweetness. As a General Tso's Tofu connoisseur, this earned my stamp of approval!",

    "text": "While researching a few restaurant ideas for a ladies night out, I came across Sakura, which may be my new go-to sushi spot.  The location itself does feel a little like a hole in the wall, but what they do give you is quality.  We ordered a few different rolls which we shared so that we could try a variety: spicy salmon, Philadelphia, and eel rolls. Each roll was fresh and very tasty.  During the meal, the staff was attentive to our needs but was great about giving us space to catch up. Next time I'm in the mood for sushi, I'm ordered Sakura!",

    "text": "Oh my, how many good things can I say about Sakura? Well many, based on the authentic Chinese food I've ordered in or eaten at the restaurant. I'm a regional Chinese foodie meaning that I like to find places like this that serve Northeastern or Northwestern Chinese food rather than the much more ubiquitous ( at least in Pittsburgh) Sichuan food or, in other places I've lived, the equally ubiquitous Guangdong (Cantonese) food. Before the opening of the equally fabulous Northeast Kitchen down the street (which only does Northeastern Chinese food) Sakura was about the only place to get Northwestern (Xi'an) Chinese food which overlaps with some Northeastern  Chinese food as well. I've had several noodle dishes such as the Hot Oil noodles and hand cut noodles and they have been quite tasty. One particular favorite of mine is the Shredded Pancake Lamb Soup,   but I also love the spicy Laotongguan Pork Sandwich,and Lamb Minced Noodle Soup. Another wonderful traditional Western Chinese dish is Cumin Lamb and the lamb stew is yummy! I still have to try the Home style Pork Belly with Youtiao and Nang Bao Rou but another dish I love and encourage you to try is the Golden Pancake Pork or any of the 'pancake' (not the sweet Euro pancake we eat for breakfast but more the Silk Road variety!) dishes. I'm going to have to get in there on a Saturday or Sunday when they serve a classic Chinese breakfast/brunch. Chinese food lovers do yourself a favor and go to or order from Sakura their traditional Chinese dishes. You can always come back for some sushi!",

Craving sushi? The fish isn't the freshest, but this is not the worst place to get sushi in Pittsburgh. (Trust me; I've had much worse.) Unless you have ridiculously high standards, you'll probably be satisfied if you order the right rolls. We ordered the shrimp tempura roll, dragon roll, salmon avocado roll, and the red dragon roll. The red dragon roll was probably the best of the four, but all of them were average to good. And I wasn't even hungry; if I were, then I'd probably think they tasted better. Boyfriend was a bit more harsh though (\"it's a little better than GEagle's sushi\"). The only thing that really bothered me was that the AC wasn't on even though it was 80 degrees out.

I guess it's the same people who ran Hunan Kitchen? I definitely liked HK better.  The waitress was quite nice. Not engaging at all, but nice. I liked the decor and had positive expectations for the food. The lunch special was $8 which would have been a good price if the quality of the food matched everything else. The tempura was blah and the sushi was weak. We also ordered an unagi maki and I couldn't taste any eel at all. It was mostly cucumber.  I hope they improve their kitchen because Squirrel Hill could use some better Japanese options. Otherwise, please bring back Hunan Kitchen.",

The place has a very chinzy \"I'm trying really hard to be high brow and expensive\" which can be deceiving to some. The waitress was attentive, but kinda hyper in this nervous way. First of all, the beer that she brought the husband was WARM- very warm, almost as if it was sitting outside. When I asked, politely if she would take it back and bring him a cold one she seemed confused, almost confrontational. She brought it out, reluctantly. Then, the food. We ordered the Sashimi Deluxe, expecting, well, nice pieces of sashimi. What she brought out was a huge plate of shoestring carrot (not radish, or seaweed) and tiny, microscopic bits of sashimi. I thought for a second that the chef was playing a trick on us, and that we were unknowingly playing a game of \"hide the sashimi\", so I began digging into the copious amount of carrot, in hope of finding the hidden prize. No, it was not a game. And to top it off, they charged us for 2 BEERS.   Ugh, I hope someone shuts this place down soon.",

I was craving sushi and Sakura had a lower minimum order price than Sushi Too.  Ordering is easy through Campus Food.  They said delivery would be an hour but it was just about half an hour, which was excellent.  They also kept the vegetables tempura separate from the rolls so the sushi didn't get heated up, which I appreciated.  The vegetables tempura were fine but i didn't think the choice of vegetables was all that good.  There were sweet potato pieces, some kind of squash, broccoli, and half a bell pepper.  I would have liked a little more variety.  They used julienned cucumber instead of a big chunk, so the rolls tended to fall apart.  The avocado rolls were ok.  Even though it's cheaper than Sushi Too, I'd rather pay a bit extra.  The quality shows.",

    "text": "After a trip to New York and eating at Xi'an Famous Foods I was having an intense craving for lamb-based chinese food. A bit of googling brought me the menu for this place. They have 4 or 5 lamb dishes on their chinese menu.  I hightailed it over there for lunch, requested the Chinese menu, and I was not disappointed. We had the Xi'an style bbq pork sandwich, lamb stew w/ hand made noodles and cold chicken in chili oil.  All dishes were fantastic.  Lamb stew was served with chopped cilantro and scallions on the side. It was easily enough for four people. Chopped lamb, gamy lamb broth, chile, cumin, root vegetables. My dining companion characterized the dish as \"chinese lamb stroganoff\" which isn't far off. I'm taking one point off because the noodles were kind of mushy, but the flavor was spot on.  Chicken appetizer was fine. Served cold on the bone, chicken was moist and the chili oil sauce was spicy and refreshing. I'd bring this for a picnic any day.  The pork sandwich was the clear stand-out. It was *beyond* -- spicy pork belly, chopped and seasoned with fresh cilantro, scallion & chile, served on a split steamed wheat bun that was then grilled. This was definitely my favorite dish, and if there is any justice in the world this should become a foodie cult item in the city of Pittsburgh. A must eat.  Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful and we had a great conversation about lamb and its various preparations.  I went with one other person, but we easily had enough food for 4. Our check came out to $32 after tax & tip.   as for their sushi... who knows?",

Their authentic Chinese menu is amazing (and so is their non-hibachi japanese items)!  They have many western style Chinese dishes, that have influence from the silk road and central Asia.  Their sushi is good, and they have the most awesome lunch boxes around; although Oiishi Bento in Oakland gives them a run for the money.  They now offer Chinese breakfast on weekends.  Also the hot pot is great!  It is where Confucius and Genghis Khan blend.  The flavors of the silk road, I love you Sakura!",

First the waitress was completely annoying saying \"Thank you Thank you\" every time she even took a plate away(for each and EVERY plate) or filled our water. It was so mechanical and inappropriate most of the time. I'm sure she's a perfectly nice Chinese girl who has been instructed to put on a pseudo Japanese affectation, which doesn't translate well into English.   Everything we ordered was disappointing. Maybe their sushi is better, but all the other Japanese items were terrible. It was also so overpriced. Ironically we had decided to not order sushi, bec we though we wouldn't be as disappointed by teppanyaki. And everything came to our table cold, even though there was only one other table being served in the restaurant.   I think the owners of Sakura should go back to making Chinese food. Though I never really like Hunan Kitchen, it was a lot better then than it is now.",

There was an unknown noodle like looking bed under fish (that some restaurants place under their sashimi) was just very unattractive. I've never figured out what that was...

Salad sauce (salad and miso soup comes with chirashisushi)- I almost always like salad sauce that Japanese restaurants have and this one was no exception.  Vegetable udon- noodle and soup came separately (dahhhh...). It was truly vegetable udon. Not just veggie unon but VEGETABLE udon. It seemed like there was as much as veggies as noodle and I LOVED Loved Loved it. Onion was cooked and the crispiness was well reserved, not soaked in moisture.
