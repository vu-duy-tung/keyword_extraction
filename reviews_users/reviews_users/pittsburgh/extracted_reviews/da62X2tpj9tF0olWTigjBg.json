It's always so fresh. The sushi gets 5 stars.The staff is also incredible. The owner goes out of his way to walk around and check on tables. It is very clear that he wants every guest to have an enjoyable dining experience. However, if you are looking for great hibachi, look elsewhere. I've tried the hibachi chicken, steak and shrimp. I've never been that impressed. It's fairly standard for hibachi. I've definitely had better fried rice and miso soup. The hibachi gets 3 stars. Another issue when eating at Little Tokyo is getting a table. It seems like business is hit or miss.Some nights I have tried to get a table for 3 and had to wait 40 minutes. Last weekend, we were able to get a table for 6 without waiting. I suggest you call ahead if you have a large party.",

At Little Tokyo, you get cold flavorless rice clumped into a solid mass of blah.  Also, what is the point of a sushi bar if you aren't interacting with the sushi chef? Why give your order to a waitress who then trots over to a computer terminal and types in your request, only to have it  show up on a print-out two feet away from where you sit?  If you have enjoyed Little Tokyo, you owe it to yourself to try a REAL sushi bar.  Oh, I forgot to rant about the crappy syrup substance used on the eel. Yuck.",

Instead of egg or octopus appreciate the albacore & halibut  --- Pittsburgh Roll ($5)     *   BF thought it was small rolls in terms of diameter but tasty    *   Pittsburgh Roll had crab & something  -- Shrimp Tempura Roll ($5.50)    *   BF thought it was small & mediocore   The Service Nice waitress but not the most attentive; had difficulty flaggin' down/finding her to get refills or some additional stuff Overall nice atmosphere",

My husband was raised in MtL and has been eating at this place for as long as he can remember.  He introduced me to it when we were dating and it has become our go-to place.   We've learned the hard way that sushi in Pittsburgh is best served HERE.  The fish is flavorful and bright and the sushi is artfully crafted.  I've sampled a few non-sushi dishes, but stick with the raw stuff because, well, it's pure heaven.  We have our favorites - black marlin and yellow tail sashimi, eel nigiri and the spicy tuna and philly (fresh salmon, only!) rolls.  We just discovered the spicy scallop in seaweed and it is to die for.    We went through a phase during which we celebrated milestones (birthdays, promotions, etc) at different \"hot spots\" around the city and were always left a bit disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, we certainly eat elsewhere, but our celebratory dinners are always with Frank, et al @ LT.   Now, I'm not wearing blinders and certainly recognize that the place on Ellsworth in SHY is higher end and offers a more elegant experience, but the quality of the fish really isn't that different... not to mention, who splurges for that on a regular basis?    Look no further (and skip the craziness and mediocrity of Nakama) and go to LT.  Just don't take our spot at the sushi bar!",

I just wish they'd bring back the Maki Regular Special on the menu. After visiting a few times, the owner (Frank) and the servers (Chi, Danyu, etc.) treat you like family. I'm amazed they remember our names, ask about our family members by name, and follow-up on matters previously discussed.",

The sushi is spectacular and there is high attention to detail.  The miso soup is made completely from scratch, no cans.  The grated radish and other garnishes are made fresh daily.  There is no hint of staleness in anything.  The bartender is also generous in his pours.  We are never in a hurry when we go for sushi so I haven't paid too much attention to the time it takes but they always bring out the next item as we are finishing the previous.  We have frequented here for a little over a year and always leave very pleased.    For the food quality and attention to detail the prices are also extremely reasonable.",

Then the hibachi, the vegetables were Rae and way undercooked, the rice had no flavor, and the chicken was bland... the best part is, they have a small part of the kitchen behind the seating, and I think our waitress is the one who cooked our meals. For 40 bucks, I will not be returning. If I want good sushi I will go to the slippery mermaid in sewickley and if I want good hibachi I will go to make me.

Should I rate this with the same expectations or on a Pittsburgh Seafood bell curve? So, off the boat freshness aside Little Tokyo does a good job of creating the sushi experience as any place in Seattle. The staff is friendly and some waitresses barely understand English.... \"Side of steamed rice, not salad please.\" OK nevermind bring me what you think I need. This may sound mean, but I do not want white people or Mexicans serving up my sushi!  So anyways, been here about four times and have always been sufficiently satisfied. They have a decent selection of nigiri sushi and my wife loves the rolls. I am not a roll person, but I did like the \"First Date\" roll. They also have a good selection of wines to coose from ... not just both types.... red or white. The price is decent for sushi (50-60 for two) so if that is too much I would suggest Giant Eagle Marketplace for budget sushi .... just remember that with budget sushi comes budget digestion.",

The yellow tail, tuna and salmon are delicious. The portions are perfect. The fish is nicely sliced and rice is sticky enough to hold its shape when picked up with the chopsticks.

    "text": "The other night, a trying week of work and a recent tragedy that made national headlines weighed down our minds and morale. In search of some sort of uplift, we drove out to elegant Mt. Lebanon (the Shadyside of the unfairly ignored South Hills) for a Friday night meal. We almost supped at Kous Kous Cafe, but alas, we had no reservation, and we wouldn't be able to be accommodated for 30 to 45 minutes (small place!). Kay didn't want to wait that long, so across Washington Road we skipped, over to the marquee, big-city lights of Little Tokyo.  Despite its New York flair, LT has obviously carved out a comfortable presence for themselves in this posh suburban hamlet. The way the staff interacted with the customers indicated that LT is in fact a fixture here. The owner and servers alike chatted up regulars, exchanging hugs and handshakes as if they were entertaining relatives and old chums. The interiors were expectedly grand and neoteric. Wavy wall patterns were illuminated by soothing multi-colored lights and cylindrical lamps that hung down from the ceiling. The restaurant was particularly bustling and clangorous when we dined here, and that may have impacted the enjoyment of our meal, particularly when \"Happy Birthday\" blared from a PA system for someone's celebration. The recent discussions of restaurant noise levels had just hit home.   Sushi: I enjoy it for the most part. I can't say I've had much in the way of bad sushi in Pittsburgh (I'd never had sushi until 5-6 years ago), but when it's been good, it's been identical to me in flavor and texture, regardless of where I had it or what was in it. LT's sushi was not exempt from this, and after having a serving of the Scallop Rolls, I wondered if sushi is what I should have adhered to. A wonderful, crispy, filling sextet of nori 'n rice nuggets, each one had a fresh scallop hidden inside it like a prize in the proverbial cereal box, and I ravaged my helping sans any sympathy, which is how I've always approached sushi.   Being that I'm rather over sushi, I didn't want a meal of nothing but sushi, even if I felt obliged as a reviewer to have some for myself. So yes, Little Tokyo makes fine sushi.   My dilemma was that I didn't know what else to order BUT sushi. Only the starters and salads sounded intriguing and distinct to me. With that said, I ordered a soup and a duo of appetizers.   The Takosu, while listed as a salad, resembled a cold soup. The octopus was al dente and thinly sliced, but not so much that one couldn't see the suction cups. The ponzu sauce was tart, and the meat and accompanying vegetables positively swam in it. While I didn't resent the dish, I couldn't fully embrace it for some reason. It just didn't appeal to me greatly, and the serving was scant.  Disappointing me further was the Ebi Shumai. The six, shamefully tiny, rubber plugs filled with what was supposed to be shrimp failed to capture my culinary imagination, even after they were dunked in that dark \"dumpling sauce\". They literally tasted and felt like something a plumber would keep in his toolbox to stop up a leak.   Nearly saving dinner, however, was the Unagi Kabayaki. Strips of fatty freshwater eel were laid before me on a bed of julienned cucumber and brushed with brackish teriyaki. Slather these in BBQ sauce and slow cook them over hot coals and you'll have a Southern classic. Seriously, this evoked the very best of what BBQ can be with its lardy flesh, bark-like skin, and sugar/salt slam. If only there was a meal-sized portion of this on the menu. I was still starving.   Kay thankfully could not finish her massive bowl of Nabeyaki Udon, so I came in at Act IV to finish the job. The Udon noodles were a celebration of thick, doughy mouthfeel, and that's the only thing I enjoyed about this dish. Kay had eaten the egg, but I did get a tasteless bite of shrimp and as well as a gulp of the limp vegetables, but what really had me in a trick was that murky broth. I don't know if that was how it was supposed to taste, but damn it if it didn't seem like a warmed over sweet tea to me.   The service was rather delightful, though. I am writing this review not without a pound of guilt in my belly for that reason.   And when I got home, I was still flying light. Not even a bowl of ice cream sufficed.  Did I order the wrong things? Should I go back and try something else? Tell me.   P.S. I've always liked those little flowers of shaved, sweet-pickled ginger.",

We were ready to walk out and just cancel the order because of the wait.. But ended up waiting it out.  The food turned out okay.   Miso soup- needed scallions and seaweed Salad- the dressing wasn't gingerly enough and tasted like Italian dressing.  - the agedashi tofu was not agedashi tofu.. It was fried tofu in soy sauce with red pickled Chinese chilli. Ugh.. So disappointed.  - sushi was okay. It was just average for me.    They were definitely quick with the check and cleaning at the end!  Overall, didn't have a good experience and food was salty for my taste. :/",

The flavor was ok, we asked for the filet to be medium and it arrived well done, was very chewy and we suspect a chuck roast or some other inferior cut of beef was substituted for the filet.  False advertising at its best--shouldn't that be illegal?  The fried rice that came with it was ok but we were not offered a choice of steamed rice or noodles.  Other hibachi places we have been to plate noodles and steamed or fried rice together.  The miso soup was very salty and murky and not very flavorful.  The salad had a lot of water at the bottom of the bowl and was made up of head lettuce only (anyone ever heard of a salad spinner)--not very appetizing.  We also ordered sushi (all cooked ingredients) it was just ok and not the best I have experienced.  The waitress was slow and had to be asked for refills on our hot tea.  The whole meal took almost an hour and a half and cost $75.00 tip included.  Not worth the price, time, gas and wear and tear on the car to get there.",

I would have given this place three stars based on food, service and decor alone but the one chef did something so amazing for me that I added on an extra star. I requested a roll that wasn't on the menu and it took a lot persuading (our waitress) to bring the idea to the chef.

My favorite appetizer is the agedashi tofu, though the others are good as well.  The atmosphere is great for everything from a casual lunch to a pre-Homecoming dinner.  The service is attentive, providing you with hot towels to clean your hands before dinner.  They will validate your garage parking for one hour, and the mints in a jar at the cash register are delicious.

The owners are good friends of my family, from back when we lived in Pittsburgh.  I remember when they were first starting out--my dad helped design and build the sushi counter, and my mom made the original cushions and server uniforms.  One time, I had an epic wasabi-eating contest with the owner's son.  On many a weekend as a kid I would go and stuff my face with all the sushi I could eat.  I know for a fact they use the freshest fish.   I may be biased, but I think my early experiences with massive-sushi-overload helped refine my tastebuds and make me the sushi snob I am today.

So next time I will have to ask for a table specifically.  The service wasnt super prompt but that is typical in any setting like this. But nothing to snide about. But if having someone be on your heels every moment is what you need when dining out, then dont eat here or go when you arent pressed for time.  The miso soup was good and I ordered hot green tea to drink, they served it to me in a large kettle so I never had to wait for refills. It was heavy but super cool cast iron like you would have seen at a Teavana store.  Super pleased and would try again.   #takingbackyelp",

I know they have them, I've used sugar packets when I dined there before. Her misunderstanding wasn't that big a deal since she fixed whatever she messed up (like bringing the wrong kind of fish).  What really bothered me was the owner staring at me! I have no idea why he was staring at me but it made me so uncomfortable. For about 20 minutes he just kept watching everything I did! He didn't watch my boyfriend, just me. He came over at the end of the meal in what seemed like an attempt to rush us out of the restaurant. I checked the time, we were only there for about one hour (at dinner time) and we ordered nearly $100 worth of food. Its not like we were just hanging out taking up a table without paying.

I've never had bad sushi there. I always love yellow tail and tuna and will choose a few types of rolls as well. I'm a fan of spicy tuna and anything that has tempura mixed in it. (I do enjoy the texture of the tempura in a roll.). Last night was no exception. I believe we had the Anniversary Roll which was a tempura roll with tuna in top! A winning choice.   I will say the Yasai Tempura is just ok but not a ton of flavor. But miso is a good way to start out the meal.   Another thing that I do enjoy is how they give you hot towels beforehand. (I wish every restaurant did that!)   Overall, you can't go wrong with this place!",

Although I didn't particularly care for the texture of the eel roll (probably because I'm not a big fan of eel..), it was my friend's favorite. We also had a perfectly cooked shrimp tempura roll, and a deliciously prepared dragon roll with avocado on top. Paired with a glass of Pinot Grigio, lunch was overall fantastic. Just be aware of their hours, as they close at 2:30 to prepare for their dinner service.",

They were very good. They were small, and really only could feed two people and we had four people.  Everyone got the sushi deluxe but me and they all loved it. My boyfriend and I got the tuna belly and black Marlon and we really liked those rolls.  I ordered the Dean roll because it was made from soy bean wrap. It was really different but so good.    I also got the discovery roll I think. It had shrimp tempora and jalapenos on it too. It was very good and came with 8 pieces. We all decided miso soup and salad. The soup was full and not just broth. The salad was small and the dressing was alright!  Overall, the restaurant was great and super yummy and we will return !",

My personal favorite is the American Dream roll which is shrimp tempura, fried egg, rolled with a sauce on top. It is crunchy and tastes great. The First Date roll is also a hit with spicy tuna on top and rolled with salmon inside. Their plain spicy tuna roll is also very good. The philly roll is always a hit with smoked salmon and cream cheese. The only roll I have had that I did not like was the lobster roll. It is disappointing as it is not whole lobster meat but rather a mushed lobster salad.    We also like to get their Ebi shrimp tempura as an appetizer. The shrimp is butterflied and fried in a delicate tempura batter. For being fried, they are so light and melt in your mouth! Also, their shrimp balls are a must. They are little balls of shrimp and cabbage deep fried served with a creamy shrimp dipping sauce.   If we are not getting sushi, sometimes I will get the chicken and shrimp hibachi. They do not have hibachi seating so it is done in the back. Their shrimp sauce is great with the fried rice too! Overall, a great place to get fresh sushi and shrimp tempura.",

The hostess gave us a buzzer and we proceeded to wait for our table. After about 15minutes our buzzer went off. We were pleasantly surprised how fast it took considering how busy it was. When we approached the hostess, a woman I assume to be the owner, took the pager, looked at us confused and yelled \"you just go here!\". Not really knowing what her point was we continued to stand there and wait to be shown to our table. Instead the woman annoyingly shook her head at us (as if we'd cut the line) and gives us a new pager without saying a word. Finally I ask what was happening and she says we had just gotten there and she hit the wrong button. Again, trying to blame us for her mistake. No apology, no explanation until I forced her to explain.   We finally got seated and was promptly served with water and hot towels. About 5minutes later another party of two sat next to us with a larger party arriving a few minutes after that. A server promptly took drink orders and appetizer orders for all the parties around us but no one came to even get us drinks! Finally after seeing that the parties around us had their drinks and orders taken and we hadn't even seen a server since we had been given water we decided we were leaving. As we walked out the other owner stopped us and said our server was coming right now. After waiting at our table with no service for over 20minutes we were not willing to stay. The owner proceeded to argue with my fiance in the middle of the busy resturant before we left.   I know this resturant has a huge following in Mt. Lebanon but the service is absolutely terrible and the staff is rude. We left and went to Totopo down the street which is always top notch service and amazing food.",

We both ordered the steak and shrimp and both our orders didn't come with our shrimp. They then brought out shrimp for us, but it was only enough portion for one plate. We were upset by this. The sushi was very good and quick to come out. The service was slow overall though. They were not attentive for drinks at all. We sat at a table that was behind the wall of the bar. There was cough syrup tucked behind the alcohol bottles. I found this odd. The food overall did taste good, service was iffy, and atmosphere was casual and nice. We won't be back, but it was nice to try.",

Finally got waters after about 10 minutes then I think the server must have gotten lost.  After about 15 minutes, we had to track her down to let her know we were ready to order.  Soup and salads came out quick.  However, it took 40 minutes to get our food.  The waitress apologize for the delay and the manager came to our table to apologize but offered nothing as a way to compensate for the long wait.  She told us it would be another 10 minutes and it ended up being 20.  Food was great but the service was horrible and we will never go back.  I would feel differently had she just offered to take something off the bill, offer desert, etc. but she did not.",

Aside from the sushi being UH-MAZING, the atmosphere is cool and very non-Lebo -- unless you're there during a 5 year old's birthday dinner, which always makes you ask why.  But then you remember you're in Mt. Lebanon.  This does not detract from the experience, but merely adds to the people watching.  Frank is a great owner, and is always floating around in case you have any concerns.  The prices are great, and you always feel like you got more than what you paid for.  I've been going to Little Tokyo probably for at least 15 years, and will continue to go for as long as possible.  For a light lunch, I recommend the Sansai salad and shrimp tempura roll.  For a satisfying dinner, I recommend the edamame, a dragon roll, and a discovery roll.  I'm drooling just thinking about it...",

    "text": "Was at my boyfriends and had a hankering for some good sushi! So he suggested this place since he tried there other location on E. Carson Street on Pittsburgh South Side. Let me tell you I was not disappointed! It was just what my craving was asking for! The place is a decent size but we got seated right at the end of the sushi bar where we could see all the action being taken place.  We got to see the \"sushi masters\" assemble a boat of sushi which looked delicious along with all the other rolls they were slinging out. First up I got some Miso soup to try which had a lovely deep and rich broth to it. Next we got shrimp balls as an appetizer that came out nice, hot, and fresh with a luscious dipping sauce along the side.   For our main course we chose 4 different rolls to try the American Dream, First Date, Rock and Roll, and the Lobster Roll. I won't go into detail on each one since you can check out what's in each of these yummy rolls on there website but my favorite was the First Date. It had tempura shrimp with spicy tuna on top of it! Really happy I got recommended this place and hope to come here again soon!",

We were patient and understanding until the check came and was charged for several things I didn't add to the order. Instead of maybe considering they didn't give blank order forms to be filled out, I was asked if I remembered it... No, I had zero intentions of spending almost $89 (pre-tip) on dinner for 2. I thought some of the sushi were complementary due to the wait and maybe they were just being nice... No, it cost an extra $30+. What should have been a check for only 4 rolls became a check for 4 rolls and 5 orders of the 2 pieces... I did notice the 1 for the 2 pieces, but thought maybe I was just tired and seeing things since we did just drive to Pittsburgh for the weekend (long day today). Anyways, we paid for everything. I was too tired to fight it, but I won't be coming back either. Make sure you check the order sheet and that it's completely blank. Otherwise, I don't think an extra $30 of food you didn't order added onto your check will be worth it. Should have known though... There's no such thing as a \"free\" anything.",

    "text": "This was not our first time trying this restaurant but we like it so we keep coming back. We came here on Friday night during dinner. The restaurant itself is decorated nicely. What I like about it is that it's not too dark like the other restaurants, it also looks family owned. When you first sit, they give you hot steamed towels to clean your hands which I thought was pretty neat!  We ordered a maki roll of shrimp tempura, regular platter of sashimi and a bowl of chicken udon. The food came within a reasonable amount of time and the sushi came with a salad. The platter also came with soup and salad. The soups and salads came out first and were delicious!  The reason why I'm giving it a 4 star instead of 5 is because I was disappointed in the shrimp tempura roll. It was the smallest shrimp tempura roll that I've ever seen! It only had the shrimp. For the numerous times that I had this at other locations, there was always something with it such as cucumber/ lettuce/crab. This was just rice, seaweed and shrimp. It was not worth it for me since I've had pretty good shrimp tempura rolls. The sashimi was good. It came in a plate with 15 pieces of fish and a small bowl of rice. I also enjoyed the chicken udon. Another small downside is that they do not accept Discover.  Overall,  it was a good experience.",

Everything came with speed and efficiency, yet never felt rushed or hurried.   I went started with seaweed salad. The portion was large, which is great because it was delicious. It tasted fresh and refreshing - just like a good seaweed salad.   I ordered two speciality rolls - First Date Roll (tempura shrimp with spicy tuna) and a Rainbow Roll (California roll topped with avocado and a \"rainbow\" of salmon and tuna). Both rolls were beautiful to look at and tasted great. I also split an order of Salmon and Tuna nigiri.   My wife ordered the Salmon Dengaku - which she loved. The portion was quite large (which allowed me to have a few bites!).   Overall I was very impressed with this entire meal. We will be going back to Little Tokyo soon.",

But lately the service and speed at which the food arrives have both been dismal.   This is completely uncharacteristic of the Little Tokyo that I grew to love over the past 10 years since moving a block from their Southside location.  The sushi has always been fresh but the repeatedly poor, slow service at this location has left a bad taste in my mouth.",

The rolls are the perfect size (not too small for regular rolls, not too big you can't fit in your mouth for deluxe rolls). The atmosphere is very traditional and waits are never unreasonable. I usually park in the garage across the street which is only a couple dollars given the length of time you're dining.  To start, the ginger salad (particularly the dressing) is phenomenal. I usually order one or two traditional rolls and one or two deluxe rolls to share. The yummy roll is my favorite deluxe roll and has warm shrimp tempura in the middle with shredded crab on top. I love the salmon at Little Tokyo as it has a nice smokey taste to it and is always fresh. The eel sauce is also great! It may not be the fanciest sushi or trendiest restaurant, but it's always the tastiest and always a quality experience.",

While they're not on GrubHub yet, I'm going to cross my fingers for soon because this is my new sushi place!  Why do I love it so much? It's great to go in right at 5pm when they open and take our 15 month old son. It's not busy yet, so we can get right in, and it's a nice casual dining experience. The staff has always been super friendly and they just fawn over our son, it's super cute!   They offer sushi and habachi. I've never gotten the habachi, so I can't speak to that, but I think the sushi is great. I don't know why, but their spicy tuna roll is one of the best I've ever had! I think it's the combo of being fresh, just the right amount of spicy and just plain delicious! I literally order two orders every time I go because it's so good!   They offer some specialty rolls, but most are fried, so I steer clear of them. I also have had the rainbow roll, which is good as well. I also appreciate that they have gluten free soy sauce for me. I need to branch out and get more rolls, but it's so hard with the delicious spicy tuna!   The prices are reasonable and it's now our go to weekend spot!",

All of the choices were very nice with the sushi fresh and tasty. They do tend to use a little less rice than I am used to but, that is an observation as opposed to a complaint.  Nice selection of sake to go with the meal as well.  My only quibble was the mochi. There were only two choices for dessert- green tea and red bean. The green tea was very good but the red bean was a bit chewy and \"mealy\".  All in all a very nice dinner!",

I drink lots of water so my glass is usually empty BUT not here. The owner walks around making sure that everything and everyone are well taken care of for the fining experience. I called him over after recently eating there noticing that our salads weren't charged. He said that wee you have a large order they are complimentary. WOW!  What a welcome gesture!

    "text": "In terms of standard sushi rolls, I don't think I've found a better spot in Pittsburgh. It's so simple, but Im a huge fan of their yellowtail roll. Very good portions of fish -- not those little mini rolls you'll find at other sushi restaurants. In terms of speciality rolls, they've got some great options -- but you're going to find some of your more standard speciality rolls here. Very classic sushi restaurant. You won't find a list of 20 something speciality rolls, which I like. They make what they make and they make it well.  Ginger dressing salad is also real solid. Atmosphere is cozy and great for a casual weeknight or weekend. Sushi bar allows for a quick drop-in as well, with a nice sized TV to keep your eye on a sports game, etc.",

    "text": "I visited Little Tokyo restaurant with some friends last night. We did have reservations at 7 but they were really busy and we weren't seated till probably 20 after. Not a huge deal since it was just us girls and no kids, or husbands, to get restless. We had a nice area to just the 9 of us so even though it was busy and a little noisy we could all talk with each other. The Happy Birthday song that played over the speaker was obnoxiously loud however.  I am not a sushi fan but all the rolls looked so pretty and my friends were happy with their choices. I ordered the chicken hibachi which was pricey but was good. The chicken and vegetables came out on a separate plate and it was all delicious. The rice was served separately so I just put that right on top. Very happy with my selection. I was however contemplating a ramen bowl. My friend next to me got it and it smelled delicious and was full of awesome veggies and ramen. She said very delicious and was also very happy with her selection.  Our waiter was very attentive to filling our waters. The whole dining experience took a long time though. We were there about 2&1/2 hours. I paid cash. However the other 8 girls used cards. And the waiter added in his own 18% gratuity. Not everyone was happy about this.",

    "text": "I have been really hungry for Japanese food, so I tried Little Tokyo Saturday night after the movies.   The kitchen was very skilled and helpful. I ordered two items not on the menu, a miso ramen, and salmon roe with quail egg sushi.   I'm not sure what was wrong with my server. She didn't know what miso ramen was. She didn't want to ask the kitchen if they would make it, and tried to talk me into udon or soba instead. When I again asked her to ask the kitchen if they would make miso ramen, they immediately said yes. Same procedure with the sushi order.   I got to the restaurant around 9:45 and they close at 10:30. My salad and green tea came out right away. The salad dressing was delicious. Unfortunately, the pieces of lettuce were HUGE. As I was eating with chopsticks, this was problematic. I had to fold each piece of lettuce in half and then in half again to be able to get it into my mouth.   Next came my ramen. The soup did not have much miso in it- I believe they had made it with their usual miso soup as a base. When the server brought out the ramen, it had a ladle in it, but no spoon was offered. I asked her for a spoon, and she pointed to the ladle and said, \"there.\"  I had to bother the sushi chefs to get her to bring me a spoon. Although they did not put pork, or egg, or corn into the soup as is customary, they did have lots of julienne vegetables - bamboo shoot, zucchini, carrot, etc., and they made the soup delicious. I was very pleased with it.   Next came my salmon roe and quail egg sushi. The sushi was very fresh, and the portions fairly large. It was also tasty.   While there were still lots of people in the restaurant, my server started taking the soy sauce and silver ware off the sushi bar and the empty tables - at 10:05 pm. The message was pretty clear - finish up and get out!!  There were four front of house staff and six cooks/chefs working. There was plenty of time to get the place cleared by 10:30. When I tried to pay my bill at 20 after, everyone had disappeared. I had to call out three times before someone came to take my payment.  I stopped in the ladies room on my way out, and there was no toilet paper!  If I had to rate this restaurant on the food alone I would've given it five stars. However, the place seems to be geared to the staff's needs over and above those of the customers.",

    "text": "From the beginning this place was a disappointment, and it steadily went downhill from there.  Walking in, they looked at me for about 10 seconds, staring in shock at me, as if I walked in with a horse head or something. I'm not sure if I'm not a common demographic that visits the restaurant, or what the deal was...Finally, they realized that I walked in with the hopes of being seated. (LOL) I got to sit at the sushi bar, and then it began... I watched as one of the men behind the sushi counter cut up fish. He went through about 10 different fish types, opening packages, cleaning the counter, cutting the fish (with the same knife), AND NOT ONCE DID HE WASH HIS HANDS. He touched a cleaning rag, then went to touch the same fish, then touched doors, then touched a different fish. He would touch salmon, then touch a different fish. The disgusting amount of contamination in the restaurant was so sickening, too bad I had already ordered (luckily with no fish, only shrimp and scallops). So, to start, I got a Miso Soup and I decided on the Scallop Roll and the Shrimp Tempura Roll, both rolls I've gotten all across the country and am very familiar with.  The miso soup was $3! THREE FREAKIN DOLLARS? (2.95 to be particularly exact) I have eaten sushi on a beach in San Diego and didn't pay that much for a miso soup. The taste was off, almost greasy-tasting. Left a strange taste, so much so I ate two pieces of ginger as soon as I could.  Then, my rolls. Not a piece of avocado on my plate. Not a slice of cucumber on my plate. So strange,  and yet I got charged so much for both rolls. I mean $6 for shrimp tempura is about average, but normally there's imitation crab meat and avocado/cucumber with the shrim tempura inside the roll. So disappointed.  Then when it came time to pay, I waited 10 minutes to get the check then the waitress never came back and I ended up getting up and paying at the counter. Definitely a disappointing experience and I don't recommend this spot to anyone that knows sushi.",

On a Saturday night, it was tough to find a nice sushi place that wasn't booked for the rest of the night or very busy.  We finally decided on this one after calling many others that were too busy...I'm so glad we went here.  The sushi was very good (it wasn't swimming 10 minutes ago, but for a land-locked city it was damn good), the ambiance was nice (decorations weren't tacky, music wasn't blaring, TV wasn't enormous), and the service was -- in a word -- awesome.  I've had my fair share of fine dining and five star service but our waitress here was better (in kind, not degree).  We were all laughing and talking, she taught us a few things about Japanese culture, and still seamlessly waited on our table; she was just so personable.  She got the largest (percentage) tip I've ever left and she deserved every cent.  She really made the experience special for us.  I would not give a second's hesitation to going back to Little Tokyo.",

The owner, Frank is also very nice and you'll probably see him walking around checking on tables, making sure you are well accommodated.  Not trendy like Nakama, which in my opinion, is a little overrated.  Can be packed on weekend nights, make sure to show up early to get your name on the list, I'm pretty sure they'll take reservations for larger parties.

The sushi was not fresh.  The sushi wasn't rolled tight either.  The rice didn't have the trademark sushi rice flavor.

We (two petite women) had WAY too much food and took a full serving home from the two platters.  The miso soup was superior, but lacking seaweed (I prefer my own miso soup).  The dressing on the salad was great.  The Eel roll was the very best.  Actually, I have to say all of it was the best Japanese food I have ever had!

    "text": "Coming from the west coast, this is probably the worst sushi I have had in a very long time. There are no descriptions for any of the rolls. They do not offer low sodium soy sauce. The wait for 3 rolls and 4 pieces of sashimi took over 25 minutes. Now for the food, the scallop roll is mushy ( if they were scallops I wouldn't know). Actually, everything I ate was mushy. The service was inattentive. I waited 10 minutes for a refill for my iced tea, after the owner and another server looked straight at my empty glass.",

Instead I had to ask the server (really nice lady, but definitely not quick and efficient - service was soooo slow) who kindly explained each one. I ended up choosing two and they were good, more like meh good. Since I'm from SoCal, I definitely wouldn't go here when I'm back in Pittsburgh again and would try to find another sushi joint.",

Now I will say that I have had better sushi at a few places (Umi in Shadyside , PA and Coast in Chicago), but for what your paying at this place you cannot get a better value for the quality.  Those other places that I mention you'll definitely be paying alot more for marginally better sushi - at least in my opinion.  So whenever I'm in the mood for some sushi I come to this place.  I should also mention that they have the most amazing fried ice cream...ever...even better than Chi Chi's fried ice cream (for those who remember).  People it's seriously that good!",

    "text": "My husband and I ordered take out on a Saturday Night as our first experience with this place.  I really wanted sushi as I had just had a baby and it had been a LONG time since I got that craving met.  We were told it would be a half hour before it would be ready but that was fine because we had to drive to pick up anyway.  Upon arriving at the door, I could see that the place was hopping, all tables full and plenty of couples waiting to be seated.  The staff was fast, directing me over the the sushi bar where I checked out immeadiately.  As I was walking out the door I overheard the staff asking those waiting for tables if they would like to order a drink, which I thought was a nice touch.  We ordered 6 different rolls. (The David, The First Date, The Pittsburgh, The American Dream, The Spicy Tuna and a Shrimp Tempura roll.)  The rolls were all placed into 2 containers and none of them were labeled.  But it really didn't matter because we loved it all!    Based on the price of the various rolls, I'm guessing that the David and the First Date were the ones we really liked the best!  We also got a large ginger dressing to go, as we had salads at home to eat, and it was also excellant!  We highly suggest that if you like ginger dressing, get this for your house as I have tried several different bottled brands in the grocery store and none have that distinct quality that is found in a ginger dressing from a hibachi place.Our total bill with tax was $66, but we really did get a lot of food.",

    "text": "Hands down, best sushi in the city.  I think this is both if you are a roll person or if you are a sashimi person - which is not the case everywhere.  Some places make awesome rolls, but that seems to be to hide the not-freshness of the fish.  Others have great fresh fish, but can't make a roll to save their lives.  This place does it all.  J and I went here on a Friday night around 6 and were sat immediately - no wait, but the place was pretty packed.  I started with some hot sake and a green salad.  Their ginger dressing is delish!  I was practically licking the bowl.  I considered asking for more lettuce to soak up the rest of the dressing when our shrimp shumai came.  J and I try to get shrimp shumai everywhere we go as a barometer and this was by far the best.  The wrappings were complete and held in all the very fresh shrimp goodness.  Then came the sushi.  We ordered the First Date roll, the David, the black marlin, the spicy tuna and the spicy scallop.  What can I say, we like sushi.  The black marlin is amazing - mild, fresh, not chewy.  The spicy scallop is not something you see everywhere and definitely a plus here.  However, where they really shine is the spicy tuna.  Everyone does a spicy tuna.  At most places, you can barely taste the tuna in the mayo-based spicy sauce that is slathered all around.  Here the tuna is front and center with spices mixed into the pureed tuna.  No mayo needed to hold it together and all the better for it.  The David and First Date were a bit pricier and also awesome.  One was tempura shrimp with spicy tuna on the outside and the other was more like a rainbow roll.  Both excellent.    While I do also love me some Katana in Dormont, this place has the best sushi in the city and in a charming location in downtown Mt Lebanon.",

My friend and I shared a sushi boat that included maki, sushi and sashimi and all the sushi was very fresh and tasty.

    "text": "Very nice sushi in Mt. Lebanon.  Service was prompt and friendly.  We enjoyed three not too expensive rolls--they have some great specialty rolls that are spendy (but worth the price!)--and had a great marinated beef and veggies dish.  The portions were satisfying and the bill was modest.  One of my favorite sushi places around.",
