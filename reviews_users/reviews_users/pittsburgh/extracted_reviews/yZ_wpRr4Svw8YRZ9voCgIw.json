    "text": "Home for Christmas and was walking down the street and this new place caught my eye. Walked in bc I loved the decor and it reminded me of a little NYC spot.   Staff helped me make up my mind as I wanted to try everything. I've been in the restaurant industry for close to 10 years and have been in every position from bus boy, manager and chef. I always wanna eat everything lol.   Anyways got the pork sandwich and it was fabulous. Great flavor and combination of ingredients. Would def make a stop back here for sure next time I'm home.   As mentioned it's not really a 1st date place but great for couples to come in and hang for a little. Order a few things and have them come out at different times.   For those n00bs out there. This isn't a fast food joint. It's pretty apparent you order and then take your number and sit down and the food is brought to you. It's also a BYPB place so yeah hence why no drink list.   I feel like on any review people are so worried on focusing on he bad things or small bits that the good is lost.   Sure it also may be on the pricy side but all ingredients are sourced locally and are premium. These so called foodies on Yelp just crack me up sometimes. They think they know it all yet thy never even spend a minute on the other side of the counter or in a kitchen.",

Upon entry, we were greeted by a friendly employee (probably the owner) who enthusiastically told us about the menu.  We ordered a rose lemonade, a burger with fries, and a pork sandwich.  All of the food was cooked and seasoned well, and the prices were reasonable.  The inside of the restaurant was well kept, the decor and atmosphere was casual, and the music selection was distinctively retro.  We will definitely be returning to this neat Lawrenceville spot sometime soon for a relaxing dinner.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed my meal here! The food was great and I loved the tile/exposed brick decor. Plus, it is right next to Kickback, so grab a sandwich and then go play some pinball! You order at the counter, find a seat and they will give you a number and bring you the food. I personally liked the counter at the window, but there were plenty of table tops available too.  My boyfriend and I split the Burger, the Chicken sandwich and a side of Mac & Cheese and they were all delicious! The burger was cooked well, the chicken was crispy and both types of meat were super juicy.   Sometimes mac and cheese noodles are overdone and too mushy, but this was perfect...I am a macaroni and cheese maniac and theirs was very creamy and delicious!  A little pricey for sandwiches, but if you are more concerned with the quality/preparation of your food than getting the cheapest deal, you will be very satisfied like I was! The sandwiches were not huge, but definitely worth it for a good quality meal.",

I loved the camomile iced tea and hated the runny egg floating in beans thing (with some fancy sounding hipster name). The staff don't know how to smile either - which probably made the experience worse than it actually was. Three things need to change if the Vandal wants to survive: 1. Unfriendly employees. 2. Waiting forever for an order. 3. Lack of value / expensive (i.e. very small portions for the money spent).",

    "text": "I am giving this place 2 stars because I believe that the chefs here really do mean well. However, this kind of place just is not my thing. Your mileage may vary. I went with a lady friend to check this place out.  I laughed really hard when the one reviewer said that you need to go somewhere else after leaving the Vandal to actually get filled up, because its True! I mean, I can eat a snack at home. Is that their niche? Snack food? I don't know..  As others have mentioned, it is \"very hipster\" and I suppose is going for the \"less is more\" approach. To me, going out for a meal should be enjoyable and filling. This place really doesn't provide that, but instead makes these cute little dishes. The taste of the food was not horrible and wasn't something that I regretted, but I would not recommend this place like I would many others who, for example, offer great food, a decent portion, good service and atmosphere.  I think this place could be an awesome spot. If they serve great coffee and breakfasts and maybe some sandwiches. They serve beer and coffee already, so they should take advantage of that and build from there. I like small town places like this and would love to support them more if they served quality stuff.  In addition, they could do awesome dinners for Valentine's Day and other holidays that would be awesome for couples due to the environment. Maybe sell tickets to those type of things?   Overall, 2/5. It is a nice, intimate environment, the staff was cool, chefs seem to really care, but the offerings just aren't really my thing. They could do a lot more and be better.",

I had the pork sandwich (pork, kale chips, apple topping, dijon mustard on italian-style bread), macaroni and cheese and lavender vanilla lemonade. I can't say a single bad thing about my meal. It was beyond amazing and I immediately starting thinking about when I can come back to eat there again. The only downside is that it is a little expensive to enjoy as a regular lunch spot. I spent $20+ when it was all said and done, but don't regret it at all obviously. The food is served on pastel-colored trays reminiscent of the kind of trays you'd get in the grade school cafeteria, but more stylish.",

Not close to New Orleans style beignets at all.  A bit too chewy and the blueberry sauce was bland. The fried chicken sandwich was pretty much all bread. I didn't even eat the bun because that's what most of the \"sandwich\" consisted of. The two pieces of chicken were decently seasoned, although I could barely taste the chili sauce that was promised per the menu. My partner ordered the deli plate which was insanely priced at $16 for deviled eggs, potato pancakes and braised cabbage! $45 later for two drinks, beignets and two entrees were a bit steep considering there are many other brunch locations to go to in this city where your money will take you further and you will be more satisfied.",

My Mom and I split the beets and ricotta, the ricotta and leek tart, and the polenta. It was all delicious and actually more than enough food for a lunch once we had finished the hearty polenta. The tart was simple but tasty. The beets were unexpectedly warm and also really nice. The polenta was very filling. Made with buckwheat and a duck egg. There were some kind of unidentifiable flavors in it, something cheesey, something spicy. Only criticism of this dish is that it could have had some more texture and we would have preferred the duck egg to be warm instead of cold. Great coffee too! And friendly staff",

I don't know design terms, but to me it felt very LA and hip. There are cool marble table tops, a big bar (with a huge menu sign above) where you order your food and can see into the kitchen, and green plants throughout the space. I was originally going to get a burger, but the chicken meal of the day was recommended (4 pieces of chicken with 4 sides consisting of mac and cheese, pickled green beans, fried okra, and cornbread). The meal was awesome! We ate every last bit of our decent portioned meal.   My only reason for giving this 4 instead of 5 stars is the wait for our take out order. It took a little over 20 minutes to get our meal, which was definitely cooked to order. I saw them coating the chicken before frying it. So it was quite fresh and I totally appreciated it but compared to other fresh take away places in town it felt a little long to wait. But the staff was so friendly and had us take a table and got us water.   I'll be happy to go back and try everything else on the menu, honestly! Looking forward to a long run in Lawrenceville!",

Vegan options pretty limited, even though a pre-brunch phone call to an enthusiastic member of staff suggested all kinds of vegan excitement was available. Potato hash - while not bad, was probably the most boring thing imaginable. Think college apartment cupboards the day before a much-needed trip to the grocery store. Probably four red-skinned potatoes quartered and drowned in oil, a handful of shriveled corn kernels, a few thin pepper slices, and an entire half an onion, for good measure. Seasoning - none, apart from salt, which was spot-on. Culinary genius for my broke and disorganized college self, not quite what I expected for $10 from a professional. Drip coffee was just okay. On the plus side, staff very pleasant and just the right amount of attentive, no issues there at all. And we were seated right away, unlike some of the other reviews. Probably wouldn't come back, though I'd be willing to try a special brunch menu or something like that. Too many other stellar breakfasts in Pittsburgh to spend time on the blah!",

My favorite item and the burger and the chicken sandwich.    I also like that their menu has a few surprises once in a while.  Also: if you miss the fries from Station Street, I think these not only fix that craving, but may even be a little bit better.  The staff is also a bunch of nice folks!  Hope this place keeps thriving.  When they first opened, they used to have fried chicken for dinner.  I sure hope this makes a return someday.  Even if it's one day a week.",

I have been going almost  every Saturday for the past few weeks for a solo brunch here  and although I felt like I was kinda begging to be served, I never made a big deal out of it because I respected the servers. Today I brought in my friend for brunch and we walked in and nobody greeted us. I don't need to be greeted with a smile and a hug, just a \"i will be right out with you\" would make me sit in place. Three servers, no acknowledgement. I gave them around 7 minutes and four passings by, nothing. Eventually a guy that was sitting at the table felt bad and asked my friend if we wanted to sit there once he was finished with his meal. In the mean time I went to the bar area and asked the waitress who served me multiple times if we can grab a table. No hello, just a inmyface \"there is a waiting list\". ok I said, how many people in front of us? She replies \"nobody\", and asked me for my name and phone number although we were sitting right there. The guy eventually leaves and nobody bothers to acknowledge us and say \"we will get this ready for you\". we literally stood there for 10 minutes in the middle of the restaurant and, mind me, this place is pretty small so made us feel very uncomfortable. Eventually we started starring so the waitress came over and LISTEN TO WHAT SHE SAID: \" did you guys just ask the guy to leave?\". I was mind-blown. Both my friend and I couldnt believe she just asked us that. DID WE ASK HIM TO LEAVE? NO, he offered because we were sitting like two idiots and nobody acknowledged us while you guys were fighting on which in is the worst server/host in the industry. Why are you guys working in this HOSPITALITY industry? You did not care, you made two grown ass women be disgusted with your  attitude. We sat down and frankly I couldn't process it so we stood up and left. It was THE WORST EXPERIENCE as a customer I have ever had in any restaurants. And it's too bad, because I will never ever go back there again because of, frankly, stupid reason.",

The food is amazing. I had the breakfast sandwich with bacon- amazing. I think the biscuit it was on made it so delicious. My mom had the parsnip tart and she couldn't get over how good it was. Same review of the fried chicken sandwich -phenomenal.  Their coffee is also really good ! They have a good coffee selection. - drip, espresso, cold brew, lattes. We knew going into the day that they don't take reservations so we had someone arrive early to put our name on the waiting list but on a non-holiday, the wait is usually reasonable (half hour or less) And there are lots of shops nearby to kill a little time. I'd recommend stopping into Una boutique while you're waiting.  Note that the menu at Vandal has varied over time but I think it just keeps getting better.  I have also gone here for dinner and feel less enthusiastic about the dinner but it was still good. My husband got the burger and it was really good. I had the tagliatelle and it was really bitter. The scallops appetizer and the her bread were both amazing. We didn't care for the boar served with little crostinis.  I'm going to stick with brunching here.",

    "text": "Brunch.   Get: Fried chicken sandwich with a fried egg.  The brioche bun is toasted and very good quality - soft and buttery. (I feel lk buns can either make it or break it for burgers/sandwiches. Good meat but dry/stale as hell untoasted buns = automatic \"this burger sucks.\")  Star player fried chicken was  Juicy and plumpy inside, crispy skin outside with bit of maple syrup or honey drizzled - made a perfect savory/sweet combo!  The egg is also cooked to perfection with bit of runniness when you pop the yolk.   The potato hash also has very hearty flavor profile, with potatoes crisp-ed on their sides. Better with an egg. I would opt for potato hash if I wasn't feeling greasy food but was hung over.   Other things: bring a bottle of sparkling wine and make yo own mimosas. I feel lk that should be a rule to every byob brunch spots. And pay at the counter. They won't bring the check to you even you glare at them.   The only downfall was staff being little inflexible with sitting arrangement but I assume they have some protocol? Idk there was an obvious simple logical solution to a sitting arrangement yet they just ignored it. Then they ended up doing what we suggested about 30 mins after.",

Our waitress was awesome. She gave great descriptions of menu items as well as suggestions on what to try. We had several appetizers, a main course (The Pork Milanese ) and two desserts. I have to say that EVERY dish was fabulous.  I can't wait to go back and take others along with us.",

I came for lunch on rainy Friday afternoon it was getting close to closing and there were only a few other diners there. The look is very clean and cool and unpretentious. The waiter was very friendly and helpful and waited one me right away. The menu was small with about six or eight items, that ranged from soup and salad to burgers and fish. I ordered the rose ice tea to start, it was fresh made and really tasted and didn't need any sweetener. I decided to try the burger which came with fresh cut fries.  The kitchen is open to the dining area which I always love, it's fun to watch talented folks do what they love. The burger, which I ordered medium, was cooked perfectly! It came with a great mix of peppery greens and a tomato. It was so fresh and delicious I could see why all the attention. It's a great stop and I will be back again soon!",

    "text": "After lusting over the impeccable interior design on Instagram for weeks (seriously, I want to move in), my boyfriend and I decided to stop by for brunch on a Saturday around noon. The entire time we were there, almost every table was full but due to fairly quick turnovers, there was never a wait for a table.   We started with coffees and an order of beignets. The Vandal gets their coffee from nearby Constellation Coffee and I highly recommend it--so smooth and delicious! Our order of beignets came with two large beignets in a creamy pear sauce. Totally worth it!  I got the butternut squash toast for my entree, which is a spongy yet crisp bread from Five Points Bakery topped with butternut squash puree, caramelized onions, and crispy kale. Light yet filling, I wish I could eat this everyday! My boyfriend went with the burger, which he didn't have any complaints about other than the lack of side dish. At $11, it seemed deserving of a small side with it. Adding a $3 side of fries would have pushed the price point a little too high for the casual vibe of the place.   The staff was friendly and attentive throughout our meal. The Vandal definitely fills the void of a quick, high quality meal in Central Lawrenceville (other nearby restaurants that I consider comparable are not known for short waits and speed), however be prepared to pay for the quality. I'm looking forward to future visits!",

    "text": "The Vandal is the best in Lawrenceville - a must-go.   The team behind the Vandal has done an excellent job executing a refined and delicious menu with the space to match.  What i call a \"new-school\" restaurant which, unfortunately Pittsburgh has been too slow to adapt to: The food is seasonal, menu very short (preferred), thoughtfully prepared with unique touches and execution outstanding.    The space is fresh, bright, airy, quaint and understated. Two outdoor tables and a bench to accommodate the lines that will become a common occurrence.  The open kitchen lets us know this place is all about the food - not some coffee shop that serves sammies. There is a separate beverage bar which had lots of interesting options. We had the birch beer (bottled) in Natrona, PA.    The chicken sandwich was incredible - will quickly become a signature item. Crispy fried chicken, butter toasted brioche, slaw, and spicy honey sweetness - excellent.  Hands down, the best chicken sandwich in Pittsburgh.   The fries were also incredible. Fresh potatoes, not frozen, perfectly seasoned, piping hot out of the fryer, we enjoyed as an appetizer. May rival some of the best fries in Pittsburgh. Served with an aioli and ketchup.   The pesto with ricotta, grilled bread and pickled chanterelles was also exceptional - the pesto only lacking salt.  The bread is browned, oily and chewy, a welcome vehicle for the ricotta/pesto combo. The pickled chanterelles were the perfect pop of tart to the ensemble only made me want to ask for more - only 2 on the plate - i know, they're expensive! That said, i've never been served a chanterelle in Pittsburgh ever - points for that.   Service was fine, nice, but not overly so.  A few small mis-steps were quickly corrected.  Attention should be paid so as to not give a guest a menu with food stains on it.   The Vandal is one place that is doing everything right - i would enjoy coming to on a regular basis, knowing that the menu will be constantly changing and i wouldn't want to miss it. As long as they don't change a thing about the chicken sandwich.",

    "text": "So everyone kept talking this place up. We popped in around halloween when they were doing to Bob's Burgers thing. It was a great idea, they all looked great, and the food was pretty good. However... it took about 45 minutes to get our to go order. They were understaffed and over packed.I was crushed into a corner waiting for our food. I wanted to go outside but there were 15 people on the sidewalk also waiting for food. While there I heard the staff say \"oh no we ran out of hamburger\" they placed a call to the butcher and ordered more. I don't think they were quite prepared for the turn out. After we left and ate our food, it was cold (not their fault but just a side note). I live very close to this location so I figured... why not give it another try.   The space is small and cramped. The menu is small. The food is expensive. I don't need old country buffet sized portions of food, but I'd like to feel based on quality and quantity that my money was spent well. My food came. I ate in. It was... sub par. This is not the typeof place when I have out of town visitors that I would exclaim \"OH YOU HAVE TO TRY VANDAL\". It's that place that someone passes in the car with me and goes \"Have you ever eaten there? What's the food like? Is it cool?\" And I sigh and look out the window and say \"I wanted it to be. But it's not.\"   This restaurant is like the hot guy/girl in high school that every one talks about how great they are and how fun they are and how interesting they are. One day at a party you end up sat next to them and you converse and you walk away from them and you go \"am I just not cool enough to get it? Theyre totally boring. They're a complete moron.\" and you feel sad a little as you slowly walk away knowing you'll never understand the appeal that everyone else seems to see. You can dress it up in the finest and hippest clothes, but it doesn't change the lack of substance.",

We ordered bread and butter ($6) but the dinner roll was so doughy and undercooked that it was pretty inedible. My mesclun salad was good, with a few flavorful mushrooms in the mix. The scallops were also very tasty but, again, a scant portion. My sister ordered a pasta dish that had an unusual taste, not in a good way. The pistachio custard also had a different taste, this time a success. I would not come here for dinner again, however, judging from the reviews, I would definitely give breakfast a try.

The drink menu is on the right wall and it seems as if that counter also works as a coffee bar (interesting hybrid).   As a veggie, there were a lot of starters that looked very good and meatless. However I only ordered a main- the polenta dish with duck egg. I was pleasantly surprised by the giant dish of creamy smooth polenta that came out, I enjoyed it with the cabbage, radishes, and duck egg that adorned it. Serving size was massive and odd. Duck egg was luke warm in contrast to the hot polenta- not ideal.  My husband said his burger was just ok. Fries were heavily salted but very tasty (I love salt). I saw a starter portion of fries come out at the volume is generous!  A lovely evening if you want to try something new. Interested in trying different dishes there but not in a hurry to come back. A+ for effort tho, everyone was trying hard to please there.",

Not sure if it was the unseasonably beautiful weather that brought everyone out, or if Larryville is really just that poppin' now days, but the streets, parking spots, and every brunch place (and there are many) were slammed with happy holiday shoppers and diners. We were on a time crunch, and our hopeful destination had a pretty hefty wait, so we bounced around several places nearby to see who could accommodate us more quickly. We settled at The Vandal, who sat us promptly, despite me telling them we had guests who would not be arriving for another 15 minutes; I really appreciated that. The staff was very nice, and gave us the last table in the restaurant. My friend and I enjoyed some nice espresso beverages while we waited for our joiners. The brunch dishes themselves were mighty tasty: I ordered a haluski (entree) for the table to share and we enjoyed the different spins on the traditional dish that they made with a red cabbage and pork sausage. I had the fried chicken sandwich which was absolutely mouthwatering (ask for a side of their homemade pickles to knock it out of the park), and my boyfriend had the brunch burger, complete with toasted marrow-buttered bun (yum!). Absolutely everything was delicious, and I was itching to try some of their baked goods (choose 3 for $8), but we ran out of time and had to leave. The setting itself is quaint and contemporary, with an open kitchen you can observe. Cute, hipstery, and very pleasant staff. I'll be back for sure.",

She sent me an article out of travel and leisure magazine that highlighted this restaurant and some others in East liberty and Lawrenceville area. If I hadn't read that article I probably would never have tried this place. The menu is small, but that doesn't mean small on taste. Everything they make is sheer perfection. My favorites are the ricotta scrambled eggs with a side green salad and the chicken sandwich with carrot slaw.  In addition to the great food they have a delicious coffee bar with wonderful cold brews, lattes,  and freshly squeezed juice.  This is definitely a bit on the expensive and for breakfast entrees usually range between 10 and $15, but it's totally worth it. All of my out-of-town gas I have been taking here or to my two other favorite places for brunch in town.  Everyone that I take care of just loves it!  Just to know it's small and there are not a lot of tables and they don't take reservations for breakfast.",

Especially since we were one of the only tables there.  I got the lamb ragu and was pretty disappointed. It lacked a lot of flavor and I'm usually a huge fan of homemade pasta but this didn't do it for me. I guess I was expecting a bolognese consistency and it was not appetizing looking at all. The texture was a little too fine for my liking. The appetizers were pretty solid. I got the cabbage tempura and baked bread. The cabbage tempura has a delicious sauce but at times was very oily and some pieces were pretty soggy vs crisp. Cocktail was delicious but couldn't justify spending any more money after being disappointed with the main course. The brunch menu looks great and I'd be willing to give this place another chance then. I would skip over dinner though.",

    "text": "My experience of brunch at The Vandal can best be described as rich comfort food served in a delicate and bright cafe. Decor and color scheme were bright and inviting with cute little fresh flowers at each table; reminded me of a cute coffee shop. The menu was small, but there were enough items for an indecisive individual like myself to spend extra time deciding on what to order.   After some time spent deciding, we ultimately went with the beignets, biscuits and gravy, and polenta. Just from these three choices, you can tell they focus on comfort food right off the bat, right? I've never had beignets so I'm not entirely sure of what they're supposed to be like, but The Vandal's version seemed like they used a batter similar to funnel cake. The plate came with four balls of fried dough, set atop a strawberry yogurt-type sauce? I did like the sauce because it added an element of freshness that cut the greasiness and heaviness of the dough. The beignets are definitely a dish suited for sharing. The biscuits and gravy weren't the best we've had. The gravy was spiced quite heavily with what I thought was clove. Lastly, the polenta was delicious, but it was also incredibly rich and dense. Before I could get through half the plate, I just simply could not eat anymore.   Overall, the brunch food was decent but I felt like the food was just too rich and comforting to enjoy in the month of June.",

    "text": "This is a Pittsburgh must-brunch spot. With brunch offerings like smoked trout on latkes, soft scrambled eggs with rye toast, quiche with peppers and leeks, beignets, and scones, there is something for everyone. Not to mention delicious teas and espresso drinks (rose latte???). Beware that there is no decaf espresso available though (no rose latte for me-- sad). Their turmeric ginger tea is a spicy and delicious caffeine-free alternative.  We ordered a few dishes:   1) Soft scrambled eggs with ricotta. The eggs were so delicious and fluffy, and were perfectly complimented by the rye toast and side salad with lemony dressing.  2) Smoked trout with latkes, a pickled egg, carrot relish, and greens. All delicious and made for a unique dish.   3) Apricot scone served with hazelnut butter and jam. Well baked and soft, although not very flavorful. The hazelnut butter and jam helped with that.  I really enjoyed my meal and the ambiance (modern, clean, and trendy), but gawked a bit at the prices. Brunch for two easily was $50 and we didn't even order alcohol!",

Everything is presented beautifully, too; plating is on point. Recent favorites: orange blossom beignets at breakfast and chilled sorrel soup at dinner.   It was a little hot the last time I went in because of the open kitchen on a hot day, but they told me that they are about to insulate the ceiling and change that up a bit. Other than that bit of heat, this would be an incredibly awesome spot for a date--not too formal, good people-watching on Butler, stellar food and drink.  Pro tips:   1) Snag a patio table for two if you can get one!  2) Grab a cold one at Bierport a couple of blocks down the street - excellent craft beer and cider selection",

    "text": "I came here for a mid-week brunch and thoroughly enjoyed it. The menu was quite selective, but I appreciate when restaurants have a small, thought-fully curated menu. I ordered the Biscuit Sandwich and my dad chose the Classic Plate. I loved the presentation. It was beautiful and simple. I, also, loved that they list where they get their locally sourced meats and poultry. The bacon was scrumptious, but I would say the bun was not to die for and that was slightly disappointing. I did, however, try the sourdough from the Classic Plate and that was amazing. I was still fairly hungry after I was done and ate a good amount of the bacon from the Classic Plate as it was a healthy proportion for my dad and I to split. The lattes were pretty bomb too.   As far as the vibe goes, I loved it. Loved the exposed brick, loved the marble tables, loved the cleanliness of it and the natural lighting. The music wasn't exactly my father's preference, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The staff were super warm and pleasant. The only bone I would pick is that they seem to have a set way of seating people and I'm not sure if it was just a rare occasion but we were seated in the back left corner close to the kitchen and I think I would have preferred any other table. It was fairly empty, but someone else came in and they were seated right next to us in this empty place and it totally killed the ambiance and was a distraction, mostly because there was a squirmy child. They also will not let you pay at your table, must pay at the counter.   Overall, it's a very Lawrenceville, \"hipster\" place and my 20/30 something friends would eat it up. There's also street parking all along Butler Street, but we parked at a little parking lot literally right next to it which was so much less stressful than finding a place to parallel park.",

Biscuit was overcooked but the bacon and egg was very tasty. The coffee was tasty and the honey latte was very good. The only reason I'm giving a 3 star is because for the price of the dishes 14 and 10 dollars respectively I expect much better quality . The beignets with lemon sauce was very nice. 40 dollars for 2 for breakfast.  I'll try again but with go for lunch or dinner.",

While presentation was beautiful, portions were very small.  We paid a corking fee for the wine we brought.  My guest asked for the details behind the corking fee.  It was explained that people who bring wine linger longer and that the fee covers the extra table time.  We ordered, we ate and almost immediately following we were presented with the bill and pretty much coaxed to pay immediately so they could turn the table.  So much for the corking fee covering a customer who might want to linger......",

Joe was so helpful and friendly he told me exactly what was and wasn't vegetarian. He made a special pesto pasta for us and tasty Brussel sprouts! Everyone was so happy with the food and the service. They had pork loin and potatoes with onions. Everything was amazing (so I hear) but i loved the Pesto!!!",

    "text": "\"When I think of some of the things that have been done in the name of science, I have to cringe. No, wait, not science, vandalism. And not cringe, laugh.\"       -Jack Handey   And not vandalism, The Vandal! And not laugh, cheer!   This place has got it goin on. The beautiful white storefront sporting the ironically threatening words, \"The Vandal\", is the initial greeting. I lurked inside and with a quick assessment of my surroundings, Yelp's \"Is this place hipster?\" question was answered with a resounding \"Yes\". The interior designer in me was quite impressed. All components blended and set the other off with a clean, informal class. The white subway tile bar with wood countertops; marble tabletops surrounded by walls of brick, rugged white plaster and artsy wallpapers, finishing with a herringbone wood floor and exposed wood rafters. Hanging from the ceiling was a chalkboard menu with words of happiness and bodily fulfillment written thereupon.   Schnitzel, it said in the top right hand corner. How could I Not order a food such a beautiful name? It was prepared, brought out to me and, Phew boy, did I have some room in my stomach for that Schnitzel! It was pork loin (breaded of course) with potato salad, a fried egg and pickled fennel. Perfection. Plenty of food without overstuffment and plenty  of taste with a wonderful palate cleansing pile of pickled fennel. And I'm tellin you now, that there Schnitzel was goin down, and we were out of there on the run (I'm not actually joking) to get to La Gourmandine before it closed.   It should be noted that my henchfriend wouldn't quit saying that his AM burger was one of the nicest things he'd ever eaten, and I'd join him with some of my own similar praise. \"Better'n McDonalds?\" I asked. He snorted, then said with no trivial amount of sarcasm, \"No, definitely not better than McDonalds.\" Then later, \"Man, I'd give The Vandal Six stars if I could.\" Truth. I think now, as I make my failed attempt at attaching that sixth star.",

I'm not sure where the marrow was but I assumed it was mixed in with the meat. It was incredibly juicy and the tomato mayo was awesome! I was a little sad that the fries came plain but I will say that they were perfectly crispy. Lastly, I have grown quite picky of mac n' cheese but this was creamy and somewhat sweet in a really good way. I can't wait to see how this rotating menu develops. I will definitely be returning!",

The ambiance is wonderful and gives you the feeling you are not in Pittsburgh's regular haunts and the food is always good enough to make you forget that the staff are so insanely into themselves, seemingly above their jobs, and snotty. Our table was seated by the manager/owner (?) but was never assigned a server. After 15 minutes of trying to make eye contact politely and witnessing the staff just idling around, I had to approach a server who seemed insanely irritated that I had to ask for water and to be waited on. After he placed the initial order with absolutely no pleasantries or kindness or patience at all, another female server who I have experienced before continued waiting on us but with no kindness what-so-ever, I am not sure she even spoke to us, except to tell us where to pay. They forgot to bring a latte and we had to have it removed from our bill. After a handful of times at the Vandal in the last few years, I think I'm officially over it. Treating anyone like this in an establishment that survives on returning visitors and with a stuck-up-too-good-for-your-customers mentality, it's hard to warrant the cost of the meal.",

    "text": "I'm glad I finally got to check this place out. I came in around 7pm on a Saturday, and surprisingly did not have a problem finding a place to sit, given it's a fairly small space.   I expected more of a cafe style environment, but it was dimly lit with nice candles for mood lighting. You have to go up front to order which I was a bit confused about at first, given all the ambiance. I felt like I needed to be seated to get served. But I quickly realized, and fell in line. It's quite an interesting and refreshing mix of casual and intimate all at the same time.  I ended up ordering the salad, the soup, and the chicken mousse sandwich. I was kind of bummed I couldn't get the fries as an addition to the sandwich, but I understand it takes them a long time to make, so they only serve them with the burger.   The salad was different. I was kind of on the edge of whether I liked it or not. It was literally like I went outside and picked leaves from a bush, with all the stems. I think that's what threw me off. But it had a nice light dressing, delicious shaves of cheese, and a pile of savory mushrooms on the side. Not bad.  The soup was a parsnip and carrot soup with paprika and a dollop of sour cream. All of those ingredients had very distinct flavors, and when swirled together were really great.  My main dish, the chicken mousse sandwich was awesome. I don't remember everything that was on it, but it had crispy fried onions, and what I think was a mustard seed paste that packed a punch, on some nice crusty toasted bread. It was perfect.   My friend got the burger, which I had a bite of, and holy crap... I'm getting that next time. It was cooked perfectly, and the tomato mayo was to die for (and it comes with fries)!  Other than that, the service was great; they complimented us on our food decisions, which gave me confidence it'd be great. And I like that its BYOB because I have way too much wine at home that needs drinking. lol.",

It had turnip in the description. But I only tasted like egg and a bit of goat cheese I could not find any turnip piece or flavor in it. Frisee salad? Had a few meager findings in it. Really? One slice of radish ? One piece of some kind of bacon? That was part of the quiche. We had the main salad... Same salad as the quiches' with something similar to 1/8 of a potato and 3 hydrated morels . Not fun a bit too salty. . My palate needs a bit of a contrast .  The chicken sandwich was good a tiny bit hard to eat since chicken piece is smaller and thicker than bun so it felbut tasty. Price.. I find a 14 dollar quiche triangle a bit steep.  Total 44. For 3 things 1/3 was mostly salad....  So recommendation. Get the farm or market ingredients more mixed in.  For now I only think it's just ok.  P",

I like to be punctual for dining reservations as much as possible and arrived at 4:50. In spite of their posted opening hours of 11-9, we were told that they were not open yet. The staff wasn't welcoming and seemed not to know what to do with us. The atmosphere, in addition, struck me as nothing short of stark. We were allowed to linger in the rather small front dining room until the staff had performed their preparatory activities and were subsequently allowed to sit wherever we wished. We ordered glasses of wine from the brief but adequate wine list and it was quite good, a Willamette Valley pinot noir. My dining partner ordered the trout (which, to confirm another reviewer's observation) looks like salmon and I ordered a burger. Both were adequate but not what I would expect of a restaurant it takes weeks to get into. In contrast, just walking into Butterjoint, the burger was extraordinary. I attribute the main difference to the quality of the meat and the uncommon ability to actually cook a burger medium rare. The fries that came with the burger were above average and, having filled up on them, we had no room for anything else. There is nothing about the dining room at The Vandal that would foster relaxation or lingering after the meal for conversation or the consideration of dessert or coffee. I would imagine that this restaurant is more successful at breakfast, brunch, or lunch.",

So, we headed down to Butler, parked and walked around deciding where to go. I checked in with the Vandal to see if there were vegetarian options and the waiter who spoke to me was unbelievably nice! The dish I wanted could be made vegetarian so we went and got a window seat. It had a very old school cafe vibe mixed with the \"hip\" as they were playing Tupac the whole time, which I enjoyed. It was a smaller place with a handful of tables and a direct view of the kitchen, which was cool. There was a small delay because of a brief loss of power in the kitchen, so they sent us out a complimentary appetizer while we waited for the one we had ordered. Really unique stuff! They used somewhat bizarre vegetables that I honestly never heard lf before in their appetizers, and it was awesome. The first one seemed like a cousin to brocccoli but far more tasty, fried in tempura with a spicy curry sauce. The second was a garden salad type of dish with beets and pickled root vegetables with a  buttermilk sauce underneath. Very unusual and also good. My main dish was a fettuccine with some grated parm, edamame, mushrooms and a quail egg. I enjoyed it. I would definitely come back.",

I went with a friend for lunch and we both ordered the same meal, which came promptly.  The chairs are pretty uncomfortable, I'm personally picking and don't like being on metal chairs with no back support. Furthermore, its summer and the only form of cold air was coming from 1 solitary small fan put up on the counter. IT WAS SO HOT and the water wasn't even cold. Other than those complaints, the food was excellent and came in a timely manner.",

I had the fried chicken sandwich and my friend had the soft scramble. Our food came out pretty quickly. The sandwich was delicious with the nice contrasting flavors of the sweet honey, creamy slaw, and crispy chicken. My friend enjoyed her scramble as well. Overall, a nice place to grab brunch in Lawrenceville. However, beware it was a little pricey. I really do not think the scramble should be $15.",

I should've known that the restaurant would be packed and that there would've been lines to wait in because I knew how popular of a place this was. We waited about 30-45 min to be seated. The inside is not too spacious so it was difficult to stand and wait (especially because it was kind of chilly the day we went so we didn't want to wait outside). But the great part was that they offered us drinks on the house for waiting so patiently. Their vanilla lattes is one of my favorites.   We ordered the beignets to start off and they were pretty good. The sauce for it changes every so often so it would depend when you go to get them. I ordered the egg in the hole dish with tomato sauce and sides of crispy potatoes and greens. The bread was hard to cut so it made the dish a bit difficult to eat but it was a hearty meal overall. My friend got the soft scrambled egg with ricotta and rye toast.   The interior is very clean and welcoming. The servers and staff were friendly also. The food is kind of on the pricey side but I think it's worth for the quality that they serve. I didn't know that the menu changes pretty frequently so I'd like to come back a couple more times to try out new dishes.",

Lucky for us, after a very long search, I came across the Vandal which was our saving grace for BRUNCH!   No, they don't have bottomless mimosas, but they do have BYOB, so we made our own bottomless mimosas! I came one fine Sunday morning with my group of 5 and they took reservation for us. We sat comfortably, brought out our 3 bottles of champagne and Simply Orange, and the staff took them to the back to keep them nice and chilled. We were charged a $5 per bottle corking fee which was a great price.   Besides that, the food was AMAZING. Plated well and tasted great. Good prices too. We had just about everything on the menu between the 5 of us and it all tasted great. The fried chicken sandwich was crunch and juicy. The fish was perfectly cooked with a nice pickled side. The pancakes were so sweet and savory. We thoroughly enjoyed everything. Staff was super nice. We were definitely the loudest ones in this small establishment so I hope people didn't get put off by that.   Definitely will be back!",

Great service, even though we were a little disorganized.  The food was really good. I had a chicken breakfast sandwich that was sweet and spicy, but I wish I would have gotten it on a biscuit instead of bread.

I selected this place as the \"V\" in my A-Z Dining list and made a reservation for 6 since it's a tiny place.   My A-Z list is published online and the owner, Joey, ran across our event.  He took the time to reach out a couple days ahead and insisted on making our evening special.   Fantastic!  Fast forward to the evening of our dinner.  We had a couple last minute cancels, so we were a party of four instead of six.  They weren't super busy and didn't give us any grief.  Everyone was friendly and knowledgeable.   We started with two appetizers - the salt roasted beets and the kohlrabi, duck confit, apple cider, sweet potato escabeche.  The beets were done just right and exactly what I expected.  The kohlrabi dish was hands down the best dish of the night.  A great mix of textures and flavors and I could have ordered three of them.     The appetizers were followed by a commentary cup of the borscht - a gift from the owner.  Now, this is not a dish I would have ever ordered because I'm not fond of dill; however, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The dill is well balanced by the other ingredients and the soup has a nice earthy quality that was really pleasing.  Joey came around to greet us and make sure we had everything we needed.     We got three different entrees - the pork, the roulade, and the tortellini.  The tortellini was mine - not the best dish of the night, but a very solid offering.   After that, we ordered a dessert for the table.  We weren't really hungry, but couldn't pass up the combo of chocolate cake and goat cheese.   It was not too sweet and had a nice texture - a winner overall.   While we were eating it, Joey stopped by to say goodbye and make sure we enjoyed our meal.     At the end of the day, I loved the visit...and even more so because of the personal touch.   I'll definitely go back.",

We stayed bundled up the entire time we were here. And come to think of it, in the summer it was insanely hot, we were sweating the entire meal. Otherwise the place is A-okay.",

The food is good, and the atmosphere is hip, but holy ****, I just spent $35 on 4 meager pieces of chicken, A scoop of gourmet Mac n cheese, some pickled green beans that I didn't eat, and some delicious okra. I was so shocked by how little food we got, that I practically interrogated the server when she dropped off the food. \"THIS is a meal for two?\" I asked. \"Yes.\" she replied. \"This is the whole order? Like... everything?\" I responded. She clearly saw the sincere disappointment in my eyes and brought me additional food (without me asking) which was nice of her. Anyway, I think you're paying an unnecessary \"trend tax\" by eating here; it's a cool place in Lawrenceville with subway tile walls and an exposed support beam ceiling, but damn... the chicken wasn't even THAT good. I could've gotten just as much food at Union for half the price.",

The menu doesn't offer many choices so don't bring anyone who isn't ready to try different things. I had the salad, and for ten dollars thought it would be enough for a light lunch.  It was tiny and full of inedible greens.  I enjoy different lettuces, but these were greens that needed to be sauteed. They were rough and bitter.  There were about three green beans and one or two potatoes. The dressing was straight up vinegar. My mother had the polenta which contained one egg, a blossom of some sort and two sprigs of basil. For $13.  There was no bread, and once the plates were dropped off, no one came back to our table.  Because of the bitterness, I only ate the beans and potatoes out of my salad and my mother also only ate half, yet no one bothered to see if we liked our meal.  In fact, we had to flag down our waitress for the check only to be told to pay at the counter.  I would recommend many of the other places in Lawrenceville, which is what I wish I would have done.",

Now add to this situation that it's 11AM and that most places have funky hours because apparently Black Friday is a national holiday now.  We NEED  a spot to rip into these beers AND eat some great food.  We stumbled into The Vandal after unsuccessful adventures to other establishments and were instantly greeted with menus and glasses for our sumptuous beers.  While we savored our first sips, we both selected the fried chicken sandwich (how can you not? my God it was big and just looks like it belongs in the Guggenheim) - I got a side of the mac and cheese and my friend got the (very large) side of fries.  The sandwiches come on a bed of greens and a small drizzle of dressing - everything was so fresh.  I didn't feel gross about eating a fried chicken sandwich and left with a happy stomach and empty beer bottles.  This is an amazing BYO place that is simple yet refined.  It does have a hipster vibe since it's set in the hipster capital of Pittsburgh, but that is NOT a bad thing.  I will definitely go back to try some of their other menu items because they have much more refined options that would be better served with a bottle of wine.  Well done, Vandals!",

I chose the pulled beef slider with mustard and it would have been good, but the bun was soaked and again, the food was cold. My friend chose the roasted carrot sandwich and said it was terrible. There were no other sides or choices. It was a shame and totally diminished the event. ONE bright spot, there was a lovely lemonade drink that was delicious!",

We walked around for 45min and I stopped by to ask how much longer. I was told we are next but at least 20 more min. After 2.5 hours I called to ask if it's still a reasonable wait time. The lady that answered gave the phone to a gentleman that said he tried to call and wanted to talk to my son because I sounded combative when I was talking to him. To my son he said he put his number in the garbage so he can't confirm the number he called, and gave him a number to call next time to make reservation. There are many good restaurants in the area with excellent customer service, no one needs to wait a whole morning for a meal reservation only to find out his number ended up in the garbage and being told they are combative when they ask why they were not called. Spend your money at a place that cares about customers.",

Who would've thought an herb would compliment this dish so nicely but it does. The basil pairs really well with the lemon curd. The french toast came with syrup however I did not need it at all. In fact, I didn't even realize that I could put syrup on top until I finished my meal lol. I also had a side of the frites with the black garlic aioli. The sauce was to DIE for and the fries were cooked just how I like them. If you're looking for a nice, bougie brunch spot, this is definitely the place to go. It also has a beautiful aesthetic inside and the prices are not that expensive. This place is a win win win!",

I had the ricotta soft scrambled eggs (life changing!) and he had the purple corn pancakes (also wonderful!). We also shared a pecan roll before we left since everything is made in house and I couldn't pass it up!   Also, the interior is very cute and open. I loved all of the natural light!",

My bf was looking for parking. I knew then the trouble was going to begin. The host was testy with me. I tried to be friendly but no luck. When he finally seated me, I asked for a glass of wine. He got even more testy with me, bordering on downright rude, telling me that my dining companion was not there and other BS. WTF?! Luckily once my bf arrived and dinner service was underway all else went smoothly. Our server was LOVELY, and the food was excellent. A great little spot, but the host has GOT TO GO. He was horrific and rude to me and almost ruined the whole night. If not for this experience with him this place would be a solid 4 stars.",

I make it a point to come here every chance I'm in Lawrenceville due to the fact that not only is their menu is always changing (and they have separate breakfast,lunch, and dinner menus which I love), but they are consistently surprising me with the dishes and flavors they come up with! The chefs pay attention to the smallest details which make the food worth wild. I also am amazingly shocked with pricing of their food. So affordable for reasonable portions, I honestly thought it would be more expensive but my check has never been more than $30 (unless I'm getting drinks). I recommend this to anyone and everyone, they have very simple great creations as well as dishes I would have never thought to try. I think there is something for everyone here with their large variety of options and open-mindedness when it comes to their menu!!",

First the decor, lovely white wash brick and minimalist styling on the tables was quite inviting. Service was quick and ultimately friendly.  We started wth a rhubarb muffin with wonderful jam and pecan roll for the table. Omg delicious buttery goodness. Had the smoked trout with potato latkes that were presented in a surprising format and so sooo good. Pierogies stuffed purple potatoes accompanied  pork sausage. I only tried the pierogies and DAMN! There's the requisite BEC on a biscuit. That biscuit; heavenly. Last but not least the short stack of blue corn pancakes. Oh were those good too! Yes. Really liked the space, food and company.",

    "text": "I hate when I feel like I'm alone in the Yelp community in my reviews. But this was a miss for me. Came in for brunch on a Sunday with my brother and cousin. When we first walked in, let me tell you I did not feel welcome. The girls working the cafe area that seat you just really weren't welcoming.   Whatever so we sit down and order drinks. My chai was literally just a step above cold. But not warm. Tasted fine though.   Food: My cousin just wanted a couple eggs, no toast, no \"salad\" (as they call it) just 2 scrambled eggs. Waitress said they can't do that because the chef likes to stick to the menu. Lady, this is a $13 brunch restaurant not a 5 Michelin Star spot. She then said that could take a me y item and completely deconstruct it though and completely change a menu item, but not just give 2 eggs. Again, COME ON.   Ok so let's review the actual food. My fried chicken sandwich was super dry. I will say that since my cousin had to get a meal and got the ricotta scramble, those were really delightful. My brother got the duck and said he liked that also. Back to this salad though, salad is $2 and it's literally 5 pieces of greens. Mmmmmkkkkkk.   Anyways, I have been trying to make it to Vandal for about a year, so I was pretty disappointed and don't need to be back.",

We were seated right by the door, not optimal when there were other tables against the wall and further away from the door. (This morning it was barely 10 degrees out.) They seated the next two pairs in the open spot, near the wall. Strange we didn't get that offer.  We placed an order for a chicken sandwich and duck hash. It arrives in a timely fashion. The chicken sandwich is tasty, with a nice balance of sweetness from the honey. The duck hash was okay and liked the sweet potatoes in lieu of regular potatoes. The portions was were rather small and the hash needed some salt and pepper.  Here is where I knock of stars. We wanted ketchup and salt and pepper, but couldn't seem to flag a waitress. I tried multiple attempts, even saying \"excuse me\" twice and didn't get so much as a blink in my direction. We had given up when I caught the eye of the barista and mouthed the condiments request. He promptly brought it over.   We were heading out and the waitress ask if we needed a physical receipt. Strange question. No, we responded. We were told it's okay to pay up front. We did and now I see what she meant. You don't even see an itemized receipt at all, just the total. From a customer perspective, not great as you might want to review before paying should there be a mistake or question.  Anyhoos, food is good (though relatively pricey) that we'll come back, but only in warmer weather. The number of people opening the door in/out left our food cold fast.",

The menu has very unique food items on it, we had to ask the server what a few things where but overall the food was good. My boyfriend and I actually ended up getting kind of sick after eating here, I'm not sure if it was from this place or what but it's worth noting.   The service was mediocre, this is the kind of trendy place where everyone working there seems too cool for anything and is really just there to boost the image of the place but it wasn't terrible.   There is also a super cute patio that would be just wonderful to enjoy breakfast on. I think this place is worth trying if you are in the mood for something very unique and trendy.",

I arrived a bit before my friend and they graciously brought bread to the table.  I'm not entirely sure if it was butter or cream cheese that they included with the bread - but whatever it was, it was amazing!  The Vandal offered 2 options for the 3 courses.  My friend and i decided to get both offerings and share so we could try more.  We also added the scallops off the regular menu.    Not a single item disappointed us.  From the radishes to the chocolate cake.  Everything was phenomenal.  My personal favorite dish was the extra dish we ordered - the scallops.  They were the best thing I have eaten in a long time.  They melted in your mouth, the presentation was amazing.  Just an amazingly put together dish.  The owner came and spoke to us before and after our meal.  He was engaging and grateful for folks coming to the restaurant.  Since they change the menu often to take advantage of whatever is fresh at the time - I plan to go back.  Many times.    Please go check it out.  They recently added dinner - and it is WELL worth ti.",

    "text": "There's \"toast,\" and then there's TOAST.  Vandal's \"Toasts\" fall into the latter category. I arrived at The Vandal one sunny Sunday Lville morning with a crew of 6. We were seated right away and ordered from the counter after perusing the [small] menu. I chose the Huckleberry Toast while Aimee D. chose the Squash Toast so we could share.  Among the groups' other choices were the Morning Burger, a Bacon Plate and Celery Soup.  We all left pleased, but maybe just a tad bit hungry. The Toasts are INCREDIBLE, but at the end of the day, it's one [big] piece of toast. So, if you're looking for more, I'd recommend adding the yogurt/granola for some delicious protein. We were each given a sample of this concoction and DAMN, was it good.  But back to the toasts - the ingredients on top were clearly top notch. At $6, each Toast isn't going to break the bank, but $12 for two, which I definitely could've housed, is a bit too much for me for...toast. Something to think about. I recommend going with a bunch of friends and completely \"vandalizing\" the menu - meaning, order one of everything and have at it. Welcome to Lawrenceville, Vandal!",

It was beyond shitty of him to do... he actually said to me \"I'm trying to make a living here... it's common courtesy not to bring in your own food... you actually brought that? \" I haven't had a guy talk to me like that... in the worst shitty tone in a very very long time... all he had to say was \"hey next time I have tea here, hope u feel better\" or say nothing at all. He tried to make up for it later with a complimentary rice pudding (which tasted way to sweet) but I was already pissed off and I was so embarrassed in front of my date. I've told almost everyone I know about this encounter- people who know him-- weren't surprised he acted that way. Too bad... especially for a new business owner. Karma.",

I got a eggplant wrap or sandwich or something for 10 or 11 bucks.  My wife and compatriots all got burgers.    Burger patties were dry, small, 4th of July dad burgers.  In other words, not very flavorful.  And at 10 bucks or whatever, RIDICULOUSLY overpriced.  For another 5 bucks you could get a burger at Salt, which was literally the best burger you could ever put in your mouth.  But, alas, they are closed.  Even burgatory/brgr/tessoros have way better burgers than this place if you are into shelling out over 10 bucks for a burger.  The Eggplant wrap was the worst though.  It wasn't even a wrap!  It was a freaking piece of pita bread with a pool of hummus and like 10 chunks of eggplant that were so-so.  Total ripoff.  The fries were good.  The staff was really nice and attentive.  And the decor was, of course, kewl.  Hopefully the food catches up to the hype at some point.",

My friends and I have been going for months to support this endeavor. We are lucky to be able to enjoy each other's company in a cozy cafe with high quality food among like-minded patrons. If you are feeling hopeless, stressed, and questioning humanity...volunteer, be kind, be generous....and grab some friends and hit The Vandal on a Wednesday. It's cheaper than therapy.",

Immediately after ordering, a series of delightful hors d'oeuvre are brought out from the kitchen at rapid fire. Delicious and unique flavor combinations indicative of a very intelligent and creative chef. We are already in heaven by the time our meal comes out and suddenly it gets even better. The ravioli with mushrooms was divine! Beautiful complex flavors with wine, cream, fish eggs. Unbelievably good! We finished off with an order of the pickle tray because we were so impressed with one of the pickled hors d'oeuvres that we had to try a larger sampling. Devine again. The BYOB status puts it over the edge! You can bring your own wine! Next time we will bring a bottle. And our meal was somehow under $50! Plus our waiter was the actual owner and was very pleasant and patient to talk to. You can tell he cares a lot about his restaurant. So yeah, that's as good as it gets.

Creative, tasty starters (chilled nettle soup, pickled vegetables tempura, Austrian cheese spread with red cabbage and rye toast points), delicious entrees (salmon with rutabaga risotto and parsnip puree with a delicate lemon-fish sauce; fall-from-the-bone chicken paprikash with just the right amount of seasonings) and an unusual but incredibly satisfying dessert (rice pudding with sea salt, apple jam and hazelnut brittle) in a clean, no-frills, open kitchen space. Our party of four couldn't have felt more welcomed or pleased with dinner at the Vandal. Kudos to the restaurant for serving such fresh, well-prepared and thoughtful dishes and for having such a great, unpretentious staff and setting.

Number two-I asked for a biscuit on the side and was told they wouldn't sell me one because they only had enough for the expected number of biscuit dishes they would sell that day. I should now mention I was the only person in the place. For the important part - the coffee is good. I had the soft scramble and the eggs were cooked PERFECTLY! They were a bit salty but the ricotta toned it down. The toast was made with brown bread which makes my heart happy. I believe the owner was out and about and couldn't have been nicer. So really the only downside is the ordering and coffee cups - but I think that is more indicative of the brunch culture in Pittsburgh.",

The egg was soft and buttery. The cheese blended very well with the egg. I like the side salad that came with it better than the scrambled itself. The dressing is refreshing  The crispy chicken/ Fried chicken add egg was good as well. I didn't taste too much flour and very well flavored. You really get a nice big piece of chicken.",

The dish was full of texture, flavor and the perfect amount of sweetness. Yum! The pork schnitzel was also very good all in its own way. It's is very crispy however, the meat is so tender. I was a big fan of both dishes.   The interior is very bright and inviting. I love the minimalism. It's the perfect place to take pictures of your food due to the natural lighting.   Unfortunately, the service was a little mediocre for me today. The woman that helped me was very cold and seemed disinterested in serving my friend and I.

It is a pretty small location with only seating for about 30 people or so be prepared if you go during one of their busy times because you might have a wait time.   The food is well worth the wait though...it is yummy and super interesting. I ordered the smoked trout with latkes and pickles...so yummy! It was like an eggs Benedict without the Hollandaise sauce and poached eggs...it was really tasty.   My husband ordered the breakfast burger and he was very pleasantly surprised and satiated.   The only issue we had was with the service. We had ordered a coffee and chai tea when we first sat down but didn't get them until we asked for them when our food was brought out...the place was not busy when we were there, it was just an oversight but it definitely tainted the experience.",

First off, I am kind of obsessed with Lawrenceville, so that helps. But The Vandal is cute on the inside, not many tables so it is quaint, and has an open kitchen. We had to wait about 20 minutes on. Sunday morning at 11am which I thought was acceptable. It was worth the wait for sure.   We started with a cappuccino and a latte while we examined the menu and flipped through pictures of amazing food on Yelp    Everything we ordered was pretty much perfect, save for the breakfast burger my husband ordered cooked to medium. It was well over but thankfully still juicy and delicious.the cinnamon roll was overly indulgent which we had hoped lol, and perfect for sharing between 2 people. My smoked trout and potato latkes was fabulous. Light and refreshing dish, crispy latkes and the creamy smoked trout was a perfect combo. The pickles and radish gave the dish a nice bite.  Service was great and the menu had a lot of interesting dishes I'm anxious to come back and try.",

Looking at the menu, it seemed like it would be relatively easy for my friend to find something to eat, with a modification or two. Our server was so kind and helped point out some of the items that might work well. I went for the soft scrambled eggs with a side of bacon while my friend decided on the smoked trout. To make the dish gluten-free, our server suggested subbing fries for the potato latkes (not GF). Done deal!   A few minutes later, our server returned and informed us that the chef was unable (read: unwilling) to swap fries for latkes. Fries are part of the menu (they come with the burger), so it's not like this was a difficult request. My friend would have loved to eat the dish as it came if it wouldn't have made her physically ill.   Our server was doing everything she could to accommodate and she offered a side salad on the house to go with my friend's smoked trout dish. This was such a nice gesture but unfortunately didn't make for a very filling meal for my friend. My plate, on the other hand, was enormous and quite honestly totally delicious.   The Vandal is a great option if you have no dietary restrictions and can order from a menu as-is without changes. Otherwise, I'd highly suggest finding another option, which is a shame because it's a cute spot with very nice servers.",

    "text": "Tried The Vandal for the first time on Saturday night and had a wonderful time! I was able to snag a reservation (for a \"standard\" table, not just the bar or high top) several days ago for 8:15pm. After seeing the restaurant layout, I was pleased that I was able to get a regular table as it was much more comfortable and intimate as the other options. Service was fantastic. The host was friendly, and our waiter was excellent. Our waiter did a nice job of checking on us and getting excited about the menu's offerings but not being too over the top or overwhelming.   For drinks, I had both the orange wine and sparkling rose. The orange wine was such a fun discovery. I am a huge fan of this hard to find variety so seeing it on the menu was exciting. The sparkling rose was a beautiful wine and one of my favorite sparkling roses that I've ever had.   We started our meal with the Deviled Duck Egg. I love deviled eggs and this egg was the best I've ever had. The yellow of the egg was beautifully smooth in both texture and flavor. It was topped by chicken crackling and trout roe. The crackling was excellent adding both a crispy texture and salty flavor, while the trout roe didn't add much in flavor or in presentation (as the restaurant was a bit too dim to even see the roe delicately placed on top of the crackling).  Next we had a pasta dish recommended by the waiter - the Pappardelle two ways. I enjoyed the onion topping but the dish left a bit to be desired in my opinion, especially as the pasta itself was too al dente for my taste.  We split two entrees - the Vandal Burger and the Lamb Tenderloin. Both were tasty dishes, but in hindsight, were an odd pairing of items to share. The burger was very flavorful and casual and accompanied by a side of fries while the lamb was a much more formal plate.  Finally, for dessert, we settled on the Chocolate Affogato and the Carrot Cake per the recommendation of our waiter. The Chocolate Affogato was way too soft in texture as both the soft chocolate cake and very loose espresso mousse was then doused with an americano sauce. The flavors were some of my favorite (chocolate and coffee) but the execution was poor. Thankfully, the carrot cake was incredible and was really made a home run by the addition of chevre to the icing.  Overall, I had a wonderful evening and enjoyed one of the few date nights that we've had since my daughter was born last year. However, though the service was excellent and several of the dishes were either excellent or good, a couple of the dishes did perform below expectations. I'd love to see The Vandal hitting it out of the park with every dish, and when that occurs, I think you'll see the restaurant climb in both popularity and ratings.",

It was honestly perfect. The right balance of hearty and healthy. The food filled me up but not to the point of a bad food coma. I also got a vanilla latte, which I found to be a little too sweet for my liking, but standard in terms of overall quality.  My second visit, I had trouble figuring out what to order because I've recently gone vegan. Fortunately the waitress and chef were generous enough to offer me a vegan pasta dish. Honestly, the pasta was a bit salty, but who am I to complain? The saltiness paired well with my orange juice -- so it was, in a way, a match made in Heaven. The pasta had mushrooms, veggies and a kick of flavor. So thankful for the compensation.  [Atmosphere] If you're into the minimalistic, classy aesthetic, this is the place for you! The windows and white interior allow for insta-worthy picture. Natural light really changes a space.  [Service] The waitress for my first visit wasn't the friendliest, but she did her job well. She was a bit unhappy that my friend and I came in right at opening. I understood but was a  it intimidated to be quite frank.  The waitress for my second visit (I believe her name was Katie) was amazing. She went over the top in terms of welcoming, tailoring to and serving my table. I'd give her an A++!",

    "text": "I've heard a lot about the vandal over he past few years and was excited to come for my first time. I came on a Sunday at noon and was seated promptly at one of the two window seats. The interior was a lot smaller than I had imagined but it's  consistent and clean decoration made it feel homey. The staff was kind, very polite towards us and other customers as well. I have no complaints there.  I was looking forward most towards tasting their food. I ordered the assorted pastries, which allowed me to choose 3 out of the four or five on the menu. So my boyfriend and I decided on the apple oat muffin, the cinnamon roll, and their doughnut. I wished I could've tried their beignets, seen from other reviews. This plate of pastries came out first. The muffin and cinnamon roll were nothing too special, but I really fell in love with the flavor of the donut. Unfortunately, it had not been baked long enough. The inside was still doughy and I could taste the strong fermentation flavors of the yeast. I was very disappointed.  This disappointment continued as my fried chicken sandwich arrived. The chicken was more tall than it was flat and it made for a very difficult consumption process. Because of the awkward shape, I had trouble holding everything together and taking reasonably sized bites. Furthermore the chicken was dry and tasteless. I didn't even want to finish my sandwich. My boyfriend on the other hand had no problem finishing his cheeseburger.  Overall, I believe the food at the vandal is a hit or miss. The atmosphere is nice and the service is great, but I'd rather be impressed through my tastebuds than by anything else. I'd give it another chance if I knew the right things to order.",

The restaurant itself is pretty small and service is incredibly fast. They have a wide selection of both breakfast and lunch items, so you'll definitely find something you're in the mood for. I'd 100% recommend the soft scramble- scrambled eggs mixed with ricotta so that they're nice and creamy- and the macaroni and cheese. Both were incredible. Their handmade cafe drinks were also a must-try. This will be your new favorite brunch spot!",

And the food is good, but sort of on the pricey side.  I came on a weekday right before they opened, so our group was the first one seated. But I have heard from my friends that it can get packed very quickly, and the wait is pretty long since there is not much seating inside for how hyped this place is.  We ordered the scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, and fried chicken sandwich. I was shocked to discover that the scrambled eggs was my favorite dish of the three! They were so fluffy and flavorful - and perfectly seasoned! The other two dishes were also delicious but they didn't really make me say, \"wow I NEED to come back for this soon!\"   I recommend coming here with a date or some of your girlfriends for a bougie brunch. For the experience!",

    "text": "It has been some time since my previous visit to the Vandal and I was delighted to return. Having enjoyed the food at Joey's snacks at Smallman Galley who is one of the principal chefs here I wanted to visit it again. The resident principal chef here now is Csilla T.  The walls are in bad shape with holes drilled into them however, the set up is different than my first visit and the menu has now changed to a more restaurant format. You order at the counter and then they bring your food to you. If you come during the week you are still given a brunch menu which is served typically on weekends but it has breakfast items on it as well. Certain items can be made gluten free and vegan can be accommodated to a limited extent. I had a very nice hostess who told me the concept is now different from the way I knew it and that the food is locally sourced.  Upon her recommendation I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with a layer of carrot slaw on top. If you want an egg on top or a side salad there's a $2.00 upcharge for each item. I went with the side salad since it came with a very light vinagrette dressing on it.  The place was empty so I could virtually sit anywhere. I had my meal fairly fast and I must say that the chicken was tasty and it was a large chicken breast to boot! More bang for your buck here!  The salad, even though it was basic still was full of flavor so I could enjoy it. It was also a bit juicy, but no worries, my server was kind enough to get me a wet napkin to clean my hands. Staff is wonderful here and is willing to help you will all your needs.  The Vandal serves dinner and reservations can be booked on Open Table. They also have cookies you can purchase for take out or dessert and they have both wine and a limited selection of cocktails.   I was glad for the opportunity to enjoy a delicious lunch here and am looking forward to returning to try out their other menu items. Located on Butler St in central Lawrenceville there is a metered parking lot nearby. Eat like a vandal! You'll be glad you did!",

So, you definitely need to do reservations. It's small and quaint and just like me, everyone loves it...so book ahead and save yourself disappointment of not getting in or a crazy long wait.  I've enjoyed brunch a couple of times and the items I've had are as follows (no order really): quiche, pancakes, biscuit sandwich, Bloody Mary and Mimosa. Not all at once of course.  For dinner of course, The Vandal Burger that's made with marrow. Delectable and huge. Usually split it with the boyfriend.  The Vandal continues to be a yum fest. Here, here!",

The chicken sandwich is a classic that no one does better, but the squash soup, while tasty, was unpredictably thin and made up almost entirely of cream.    The fried pickles were inedible.  My resident vinegar lover, who will sprinkle vinegar on things happily, actually gagged at the table.  The pickles are radishes and carrots which I assume are meant to be a pleasant surprise but it was an unwelcome one in our case,especially since they were so hard to bite through it hurt a little.  The server didn't seem to notice that they remained 90% uneaten and didn't ask how the meal was so I let it go.  (He stopped in to check on us right when he delivered them but we hadn't tasted them yet at that point.)  So Vandal, keep up the generally great work but please annex the pickles or serve with a warning.",

The decor of the place is quite interesting ... very trendy, very hip ... and has both window seating and small sit-in tables.  Unfortunately, the food ... probably not as up to par. No, I'm not necessarily or merely talking about how the food tasted, because the burger with the tomato mayo was quite delicious (that tomato mayo was especially quite tasty), the mac & cheese was alright (amount of cheese used was sufficient, but I found it to taste overly milky for some strange reason), and the fries were alright, but the price is a bit hard to swallow. Portion size for the mac & cheese appetizer ($4) came in a weeny small tray and that's not even referring to the burger ($11), that of which I could have gotten a bigger one almost anywhere else and most likely for cheaper. The iced coffee was alright ... they also give you squeeze bottles to use before you take it so that you can adjust the levels of milk and sugar to your liking.  So overall impression ... overhyped & underwhelming. Definitely see the potential though. Might give it a try again later down the road after it's had some time to acclimate and grow.",

Each restaurant seems to have their own unique place, increasing the diversity of food choices. The Vandal provides interesting hamburgers and sandwiches. Overall, I thought the food was pretty good, but I wasn't completely blown away.  The service was fantastic. Everyone was sweet and helpful. I also enjoyed the atmosphere of the place.  We got the pork sandwich, chicken sandwich, fries, and hibiscus lemonade.  The pork sandwich was okay. The bread was a little chewy, but the flavors were great. The chicken was good. I liked the sweetness of the slaw, which complimented with the spiced chicken. The chicken itself was flavorful and crispy, although some parts of it were a little dry. Overall, the chicken sandwich was definitely the better of the two and the flavors were fantastic, I can see myself coming back for just that.  My only big issue with the place was the hibiscus lemonade. The ice in the drink had that weird savory flavor you get when you have ice in the freezer for too long. As the ice started to melt, it completely ruined our drink.  For the price, I thought it was pretty reasonable for the sandwiches. However, the side salads are pretty small for $5. While not the best chicken sandwich in Pittsburgh, it is a unique one and I see myself coming back sometimes.",

    "text": "I've been here 5 times or so twice for breakfast/brunch (sidenote: brunch is the most overrated of meals, as Bill Burr said, you're basically paying $50 for eggs), and thrice for dinner.  It's pretty great.  The food is inventive, even if it sounds like you're ordering an ordinary dish (good example: chicken and biscuits, which is more than what you'd get from Cracker Barrel).  The owner is probably the nicest restaurant owner I've met in Pgh. He really cares about his customers satisfaction.  All of the dishes are great that I've had.  Beignets are definitely worth going for, as a brunch item.    I've debated whether or not to give it five stars (what a pompous a-hole I sound like, huh?), but dinner is just a little too overpriced for what you get.  A dinner entree is about the same price as most of Cure's entrees, but not quite filling.  I ordered the lamb last time and was still pretty hungry afterwards.  A similar Cure dish would leave me satisfied.  I've mentioned in other reviews that I am not all about massive quantities, but I don't think a person should leave empty stomached and empty walleted (and by making up words, I've now sounded pompous twice in a paragraph).  If I ever get laid off from my awesome and super important job, I want to come up with a quantitative/qualitative number which measures exactly what you get per dollar spent (such factors would include, quantity, quality, variety, uniqueness etc...).  For example, an average foot long at Subway would have a decent \"quantity per dollar\" rating, but would lack on \"quality per dollar\" and \"uniqueness per dollar\" ratings.  I think we could eventually come up with an overall new way to rate places, but in the end, food is pretty subjective typically (except you are an animal who needs to be put down if you think Kraft Mac n Cheese is a good meal).  But yeah, a place like Cure, while on the upper end of the price scale, would rate pretty high on this RQA (Restaurant quality assessment, welcome to pompous a-hole statement #3).  Vandal would rate pretty highly on everything, except their quantity per dollar spent is a little too low, which also affects the quality per dollar amount.  SHUT UP NERD, GET ON WITH IT...(I would love to hear any thoughts regarding this way to rate a place, and then 'forget' to give you credit when I license the terminology to Zagat's).    Anyways, I apologize for the rambling.  But yeah, Vandal is very good, and a few months ago, I would've put it in my top 3 favorite places, but the dinner options are just a little too pricey for what you get, so I'll probably just go for lunch.  I do like that their menu is constantly changing, but that they are keeping the beignets.  Will be going back to  New Orleans soon, so I'll be doing some more beignet research.  IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND: Bruce Springsteen, in a post-2010 vacuum.  Worthy of praise, but high ticket prices may prevent him from acquiring new fans.  (This is probably my weakest musician metaphor yet, but not every restaurant parallels a music career.  Yet, I made this bed with my reviews, and now I must lie in it)",

The atmosphere is fresh but small enough that it is never too noisy to catch up with your dining companion. The menu is small but each item is done well and the service is attentive but not overbearing. This is a great restaurant to enjoy with a friend for brunch. The food goes well beyond the traditional brunch or diner experience. The surrounding area is great to walk around if you are waiting for a table or have time after your brunch.",

    "text": "On a chilly Thursday morning after a night shift, I found myself in Lawrenceville wanting to treat myself to a nice breakfast (or would that be dinner?). In any case, I had heard the good vibes coming from the Vandal, so I traipsed down to Butler from Penn to check it out for myself. With only one other patron who eventually came in during my meal, it was a quiet yet very much welcoming atmosphere that I encountered, mostly due to the friendly staff who greeted immediately upon entering. After hearing about the breakfast menu options, I selected one of the toasts and a vanilla lemonade to accompany it. I was quickly served a thick slice of perfectly toasted bread (think chewy-to-the-point-of-cloud texture in the middle with a perfect char on the outside, with just a hint of smoky campfire flavor here and there) slathered with the lightest, creamiest ricotta I've ever tasted. On top of that came several generous pats of apple jam and a few thinly sliced pieces of an Italian cured meat (whose name is unfortunately escaping me).  Sometimes I find that I enjoy food most when the contrasts between flavors play themselves out on the plate, but not so at the Vandal. The individual components of my toast melded so beautifully that the sum of the parts was far greater than any contrast each individual ingredient might have provided. (But, okay, real talk--I knew I was a goner when I found myself wanting to lick my plate... only two bites into my toast.) The toast itself was generously cut, so I found myself perfectly satisfied at the end of my meal. And then to wash it down with that lovely vanilla lemonade... I don't care if it's 15 degrees and snowing or more lemonade-drinking appropo weather, all lemonade in all seasons should be so sweetly accented with vanilla. Who knew?  At the end of the meal, one of the staff members reminded me that the Vandal also serves lunch and dinner. If my breakfast was any indication, I am sure I'll be back soon for more delicious adventures at the Vandal.",

It's a simple menu of only a handful of choices, but I have no doubt every single item is delicious.  This is because my pork sandwich, with apple jam and a perfectly crisped kale chip on top was pure heaven. The side dish of green beans, ricotta, apple jam and egg was the perfect pairing. To top this off, I had the most delicious vanilla lemonade.   One thing I will note is that this does not come cheap. The total was $22. Honestly, it was totally worth it. But if you're looking for a cheap lunch, this is not your place.  The decor is GORGEOUS too. It looks like that home decor magazine you subscribe to and want for your own. Exposed brick, herringbone hardwood floors, marble tables and exposed beams.   That's it. I gotta go once a week to feed my craving!",

I had been on Butler Street the week before, dining across the street when upon leaving I wished I had gone to the Vandal to try something new (I always like to try new over what I already know). We got there first upon opening on a cold Sunday morning, it was a bit cold in there for the first half hour I would say. Staff greeted us warmly and seated us. The menu is not your average brunch menu, it has different and tasty options to choose from which we love (purple corn pancakes, polenta and eggs, pancetta and eggs on toast). We also added on the variety of baked goods they had for the morning (all fresh and delicious). Hubs and I both had 2 of the apple cider cocktail (can't remember the name but it was seasonal and fantastic!).  The food took a bit of time to come out as we were the first table (party of 6) and two other tables food came out first, a bit unnerving but it was worth the wait. We are looking forward to returning for dinner some time soon! We have already told two couples about it so hopefully they will join us in our dinner reservation. Looking forward to coming back.",

I had the shiitake sandwich ($11), which was grilled mushrooms, cheese, and shavings of a cured pork. Good blend of flavors and overall tasty sandwich, but I thought the baguette was too chewy and wish it came with a small side or some fries like the burger does. Lastly, the Mac n cheese was really disappointing. It was $4 for a small, really flavorless portion. I ended up adding salt and pepper, but didn't finish it anyways. Unfortunately the other sides were pretty pricy ($7), so it's hard to sample the menu without spending a good amount. I feel like when your menu is composed of 5 sandwiches and 5 sides, it's worthwhile to make sure each dish is up to par, and was surprised that they haven't improved the Mac n cheese!   Overall the burger certainly lived up to the hype! I will definitely be back for that.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Saturday afternoon with my wife for brunch.  I had been wanting to come to the Vandal for quite a long time due to the awards and press that it was getting.  We arrived to the restaurant shortly before 12 to find the only open table being the one out on the sidewalk.  Due to this I didn't really get to see much of the inside of the restaurant.  Our table location was actually quite nice since it was in the shade but my wife had to deal with a plant almost draped over her and I dealt with a quite uneven sidewalk such that my chair wobbled.  In any case neither of those ended up affecting our lunch at all.  My wife and I both decided to start off our brunch by ordering a cup of coffee.  Then for my entree I decided to go with the fried chicken sandwich with an egg while my wife went with the biscuits and gravy.  Our coffee came out first and upon our first sip both my wife and I caught some bitterness at the finish.  The beans were definitely freshly roasted though and I am wondering if they didn't have enough time to rest as the longer my cup sat there the more that bitterness turned into a nice sweetness.  So by the end of our cups both my wife and I were really enjoying it.  I was sort of disappointed by the size of the fried chicken sandwich whenever it came out as it looked to be about the same size as a spicy chicken from Wendy's and at $10 that seemed a bit small.  Thankfully the chicken in it was pretty good as it had a nice breading to it and was juicy inside.  Similarly the aioli had a good flavor to it.  Where I think that it missed was with the chili honey and the eggs.  I could certainly taste the sweetness of the honey throughout the whole sandwich but never did get that spiciest that I was craving until after it was gone and I took a pepper flake from plate.  Then the egg was sort of bizarre.  Normally whenever you order an egg on the sandwich it is over easy but this one was unevenly cooked but mostly over hard.  So whenever I cut into it I got a little yolk from one side but the rest didn't go anywhere.  The bottom line for me is that I might head back here again in the future.  Honestly the meal was decent but ended up being a letdown compared to the hopes that I had for The Vandal.  Maybe next time I will try dinner and hope that comes out a little better.",

    "text": "I always used to walk by the empty store front on Butler that is now The Vandal, and hope that someone would turn it into something great. Once I started to see construction going on inside, I was really happy to find out that it was going to be another exciting food option on Butler; not just another restaurant, but somewhere that offered breakfast, lunch, and dinner in a counter-service format for eat-in or take-out. Nothing against the typical take-out options, but sometimes you want to eat interesting, high-quality food AND watch Netflix at the same time, you know?  The menu is small but the options are varied enough that it was no problem finding something that sounded appealing. My friend and I both decided to try the burger (with marrow, pickles, cheese, tomato mayo, and greens). The meat was juicy and packed with flavor; the toppings added additional interesting flavors and textures while still allowed the meat to be the star. I am a huge fan of the tomato mayo. I thought this was a really interesting (and delicious) alternative to the traditional slab of tomato on top. I love pickles and was glad to see them included, and these did not disappoint. They were super thin and had a potent vinegary punch. I wish I could get these by the jar and put them on all of my sandwiches.  The burger came with a side of thin, crispy fries which we also enjoyed. There was no sauce served for dipping, but this was perfectly fine for us as they were flavorful on their own. My friend ordered a side of the mac and cheese (which I stole a few bites of). This was really interesting as the cheese sauce was thinner than your average mac, and the noodles were actually al dente. Mac and cheese is often a gelatinous blob of thick sauce and mushy noodles, so I loved that there were texture differences. The flavor was slightly sweet but the sea salt and chives on the top really rounded this out. They could serve a larger portion as an entree option--I would be into that.  Overall I'm excited to go back. I've seen pictures of some pretty tasty-looking breakfast items that I am excited to try. Seems like another great addition to Lawrenceville!",

May be a smaller menu than some are used too, but let me assure you, the flavors and from-scratch methods do not go unnoticed, along with the local sourcing of product.  I noticed because we are chefs in the industry.  If you are used to chain trailer restaurants like macaroni Grill, this is not the resto for you, they do not have 200 menu items, they have like 16, but all done to perfection.  Don't forget though, they are BYOB, which is not a bad thing, especially for those tight in the wallet.  Cheers and enjoy this place, owner Joey is doing a nice job and makes sure to greet almost every table.",

We wiped the raindrops as we walked through the threshold, revealing exposed beams, brick walls and hipsters. After a short wait, we were seated. We noted the limited seating. After skimming the menu, we ordered a fried chicken sandwich and a forgettable salad. He ordered a chocolate cold brew which he found to be enjoyable with a rich, full bodied flavor from the chocolate. The fried chicken sandwich was disappointing. Presentation was great, but it was flavorless and bland. I would go again for the coffee but I would pass and walk elsewhere for food.",

    "text": "My friends and I went to the Vandal last Sat. at 11am for brunch.  I'd been wanting to visit the Vandal since it opened, but this was my first visit given that I don't often do sit-down meals in Lawrenceville.  However, we're fans of the dining scene there, so we decided to go a bit out of our way to try something new and different (to us, at least!).  For our orders, both of my friends had the soft scramble with ricotta cheese ($11), and I had the brunch special ($10), which consisted of chicken confit, pickled veggies, and rye toast.  Additionally, we ordered vanilla lemonades ($3 each) to accompany our entrees.  All of the components of the brunch special were flavorful, and yet they melded together really nicely, creating a unique marriage of flavors.  Given that I didn't try my friends' entree, I can only speak for my own, but they seemed to enjoy theirs.  As for the vanilla lemonades, they were refreshing and delicious like a typical lemonade, but tasted quite different due to the vanilla infusion.  As my friends pointed out, the vanilla was unsweetened, so its flavor was more akin to that of vanilla extract than it was to that of vanilla ice cream.  Overall, we enjoyed our visit to the Vandal.  The restaurant's description of their fare as \"fine casual\" sums up the experience quite nicely--the ordering/serving format is fast casual but the food is fine dining-esque in ingredients and composition.  In light of this, it shouldn't come as a surprise that the pricing is closer to Big Burrito than it is to Pamela's.",

Clearly a french inspired chef, a restaurant with a rotating menu. Incredibly well thought and layered flavor profiles on rather simply built dishes. Smaller portions, higher prices, better food. I had the chicken and it was great. The owner was walking around greeting his guests and that makes all the difference. Mr. Sliver never comes to my table when I'm at the local long-john-silver's(Probably why they went out of business).  These two places aren't comparable in the same universe. So don't mind my sense of humor.  Wildly delicious food here. Negatives;The price is gouging for certain dishes. For $24...$30 after tip I usually expect to be filled at very least, but I was just satisfied with how delicious the food was. I was also there on a hot day and it was 1 trillion degrees inside. Not often a problem in Pittsburgh, but highly uncomfortable. But it's BYOB which kinda counters that.",

They've got an open kitchen concept, but instead of just seeing the tops of the heads of the line cooks, you can truly see the entire kitchen.   The whole place had a clean, fresh vibe from the food, to the decor, to our very hip servers.   I just had a drip coffee and the smoked Trout over latkes. My coffee was bold and earthy, but I personally wasn't crazy about my latkes - and I'm a potato fan from way back.   But I did steal some of my dining partner's fried chicken sandwich that was perfectly tender.   It seems like you can bring your own bubbly for mimosas too!",

He's a food snob so it's rare that he talks like this. I had the chicken sandwich and it was awesome.. reminded me of shake shack but better. Only complaint is the mixed greens with it were salted to hell. Still ate them though. Also had a cup of their coffee made by Parlor.. very good coffee. Will probably go back to grab a bag when we run out of coffee. Anyway, Definitely recommend!",

The decor was saying the cafe was fancy, but they blasted rap music over speakers at 7am.  The food was okay, the coffee and lattes were great, and the atmosphere was confusing.

    "text": "We went for dinner and it was special!  We went after an event and ordered multiple small plates as our meal.  The meal was fantastic, the vibe was great, and the service excellent.  The only thing we didn't do was to B our own B which would have made it all the better.  We saw lots of small groups doing that, and if we lived anywhere within walking distance, this would be a favorite for ours.  Grab a bottle of wine and head over to the Vandal.  What we ate:  My partner is a pescatarian, so we really like it when there are great straight veggy options, and not just every form of short-rib imaginable, as others do.  The menu is great for that.  OK, I was going to look at their menu online to jog my memory of what we had, but that's not going to work because it was about 8 weeks ago, and the menu changes all the time.  The new menu looks every bit as fun as the one we ordered from, and if a changing menu is going to bother you then definitely feel free to steer clear.  However, on the current menu I see dishes that show the exact same approach to combining flavors and ingredients.  The Sardine/Gremolata dish was on when we were there and it was terrific.  The Potato Croquettes with goat cheese are a standard as well, and they were also worthy of a fork-fight for the last one.  We had a salmon dish, and the current one with celeriac risotto, while not identical sounds similar in concept, including the turnip puree and rutabaga. They also had a great crusty bread-dish that I don't see on the current menu.  But in place off that they have a buckwheat polenta/root vegetable/soft egg/ pepper jam dish that we MUST try.  Inventive, beautifully balanced, fresh, clean, great atmosphere, very thoughtful service.  We need to go back, and so do you.  I've picked up breakfast there and it's also great (as others have said here).",

(drool)  I was home for the holidays and my family has been dying to try the Vandal for months.  I made them wait for me (thank god).  Where to even begin?  The restaurant is in the heart of Lawrenceville.  Immediately when you walk in you get a very calm peaceful vibe.  This is not a fast food place, although you can get great food fast.  This is the kind of place where people come to savor incredible food and have conversation.  It's the kind of place you want to spend time in.  The menu is small - which I actually prefer.  They do a select list of items, sourced locally, and they do them with absolute finesse. There are approximately five sandwich options (as it stands today) - offering everything from Pork, Burger, Carrot, Confit to Catfish.  There were also \"snacks\" in the form of soup, salad, farro and beats.    The catfish was unfortunately sold out on the evening that we went, but we got two burgers and two carrot sandwiches and all of the sides (yes, all of them).  Also it's important to note we brought our own wine (bonus!).  I'm going to start backwards because I can and because I can't stop thinking about it... THE CARROT SANDWICH.  It sounds weird, right?  Carrots, a sandwich... why?  How?  But shut your mouth and stop asking questions.  Why does the sun shine and the rain fall - it just does.  It's what is supposed to happen.  Just like you, and everyone else, are supposed to eat this carrot sandwich.  I ALMOST don't even want to try to describe it to you for fear of not doing it justice.  I'm also just sitting here wondering why I've never had a carrot sandwich before?  Did my parents not love me?  Mouth watering fresh bread, Apple cider glazed carrots, chicabiddy cheese and parsley sauce.  I cannot even.  I can't.  Let's move on before I self-combust and have to drive back to Pennsylvania and mug someone for a carrot sandwich.  My parents got the burgers - I had a bite of my moms and WOW.  It was one of those bites that you want to scarf down because it's so good, but also savor so you remember what great tastes like.  The fries might have stolen the show though... I'm sorry to say.  Imagine kennywood fries but 1000x better.  Yea, I said it.  Digressing to the starters - Watermelon soup.  Hot, flavorful, savory.  We licked the bowls.  Farro/Potato - YES.  Fun, different, a little taste punch in your mouth.  Beats - we were fighting over them.    If I could give The Vandal 10 stars, I would.  My parents have already invited their entire friend group to go back - and I'm jealous.  See you when I get home Vandal!",

My husband and I tried this place for lunch over the summer and we both had the fried chicken sandwich, which came with the greens. It was delicious and would definitely go back and try the Vandal burger. However, I found mottled leaves in my salad covered with thorns including the stems. Photo is attached. Upon inspection the thorns seemed pretty rigid and sharp, so there's no doubt in my mind that biting and chewing on them would've caused injury and pain. We told the waitress and she looked instantly alarmed. She removed it from our table and walked away without apologizing. We thought she left to inform the manager/owner but she returned with the check with no mention/explanation of the mishap. I, otherwise, would've given them 5 stars if it wasn't for this incident but this really bothered me and now I have to thoroughly check the food before consuming anything from this restaurant, and so should other customers.",

The chicken sandwich is absolutely killer, and the burger is very solid as well.  I am glad they changed it to include fries!  Also, I have enjoyed the pork sandwich (which changes regularly, but usually involves crispy kale) most of the times I have had it here.  I had the catfish sandwich once and did not like that as much.  This is a must-try place if you haven't been already!",

This is a bummer because I have been wanting to go so badly and get very out of place once I finally stopped in. Also, no decaf anything. Oh well.",

    "text": "Finally made it down here for brunch, although admittedly I was hoping for lunch. Initial impressions were just what I expected but the restaurant was incredibly cold. No HVAC ductwork in the actual seating area, so not overly surprising with exposed bricks.  Wasn't overly crowded, but it still took about 25 minutes to get our meals.  My wife and I split some beignets with an orange curd sauce which I thought was very clever. For the price, I would've expected more than 2, but they were good.  My wife had the scrambled special and I had the AM burger. The burger didn't come with anything which was a shock to me as I'd seen plenty of photos posted on here with fries, so presumably that's only with lunch/dinner.  Both dishes were OK, we left hungry after a $40 meal which was disappointing. I'll definitely be back to try again, but this wasn't a great first impression for me. Entire waitstaff was pleasant.",

    "text": "I'm from out of town and was in Pittsburgh on business trip when someone suggested this place, first let me tell you that the enthusiasm of the staff is contagious, it's a low key place with high tailored food, without a doubt one of the best burgers I've ever had moist and flavorful. The chicken dish , outstanding, takes 6 hours to make it and it's worth every minute. Farm to table has never tasted this good . With the uber ride It's byob but there's a packy(Boston term) 2 blocks down",

    "text": "Food: very high quality dishes we ordered. Offerings rotate and lots of thought is put into them.   Prices are high for the portion sizes, in the teens for entrees.  Atmosphere: excellent location on Butler in central Lawrenceville, went on a summer evening, would have liked to sit outside but there are only two small tables on the sidewalk, so sat in the cute window front thought it got slightly warm without being in path of air circulation. Really like the modern and minimal feel of the inside.  Can also come for coffee during the day.",

    "text": "Today I learned a valuable lesson, if a fancy place with a limited menu has a burger as one of their options, GET THE BURGER!!! My husband taught me this when he shared a bite of what I thought was going to be a regular burger when it instead was probably the best burger of my life. Ron Swanson would approve of this burger despite him hating the hipster chic vibe of the decor.   In other news, our other choices were very well made and the service very personable but that burger will now haunt my dreams for the rest of my life.",
