It's definitely a great spot to go for Happy Hour, you can get some cheaper drinks and order a few cheap appetizers and be totally happy! And I will say it is one of the few places downtown, particularly in the Market Square area that is accommodating for a large group for Happy Hour. I also went during the Friday of restaurant week however and I was a bit disappointed. We made reservations a week in advance specifically because we wanted to try out their Restaurant Week menu and when we arrived they told us they were already all out of everything. It is hard not to be a bit upset that they ran out with 3 days left of Restaurant Week. We ended up getting the Firecracker Rolls and Buffalo Chicken Dip appetizers. I then ordered the Fish and Chips for dinner. Everything was good - but not amazing. A solid place for dinner if you're looking for a fun environment, drinks, and decent American style food.",

Bar was pretty full for the PSU game, but restaurant section was sparse. I would imagine this places gets wild for a Steelers game   Let me go back, there is really no distinct difference between bar and seating, just a small divider about 4 feet high.   You can see TVs from everywhere. This is an all around high end sports bar, with high end beer and their take on bar food.  Menu is high end bar food with some regular bar items.  Burgers, fried items and then some more \"mature\"entrees for your more high end bar goers.  Our burgers were cooked to order with fresh buns and toppings.  Lotsa smoky flavor on the City Works Burger.   Service was a little spotty, but nothing to complain about.  Extra baby star for short pour prices on beers.  I like the fact that I could just get a short and I wasn't being a pain or asking a favor.",

I'll add that the samples you get with each flight are bigger than other breweries I've visited which is nice.   As a beer/ sports fan this place is a 5/5 given the location and selection of drinks.    As a foodie this place is a 3/5. As most people have said the food is good but nothing to write home about.  That being said the vibe of this place isn't the sit down restaurant you take your parents to. So again if your going for a good time with friends for a game, highly recommended, going for a nice dinner out....maybe not the best choice.",

The beer selection is great too. Service was ok nothing special. One of the guest went in with a dog - and a waitress was touching the dog every-time passing by - but I haven't seen her washing or disinfecting her hands.  To start with we ordered the Mac&Cheese with black truffles to share. It was ok but it had not really a truffle taste (not even from a truffle oil) and I could not find any black truffles. I had a fish taco - this was ok and quite big. My wife ordered the mushrooms risotto - which was really catastrophic (sorry) - but you couldn't eat the stuff it was sooooooooo salty - I think the whole salt dispenser got into that risotto by accident. We let the server know - with no immediate reaction. But surprisingly he had taken the risotto off the check. So location 3 stars food not more than 2 stars - I'm ending up giving 3 stars because the server took the risotto off the check without saying.",

We stopped in for lunch but I wasn't very hungry so I ordered the chopped salad. When it came out, I was a little underwhelmed with how it looked but it was delicious!

We were sat right away and the first thing we noticed and commented on was how it was the strangest mix of guests in a restaurant. We were seated next to a family with babies and children, a separate group of four 30-something year old women, and also noticed couples of all ages. The penguins were playing so they had that in all of the TVs. The dress was casual for most and the atmosphere seemed a little more upscale sports-bar-y.   We ordered a flight of beers bc we didn't know what we really wanted to drink and then after the flight ended up both getting separate beers not from the flight. I wish I would have just ordered the banana wheat beer first bc I much preferred it over any of the flight options.   We got an appetizer of buffalo chicken dip and then my fiance got a burger and I got the fried chicken sandwich that was recommended by both the server and the menu itself. (Designated by a little \"CW\" symbol next to it.) my fiance liked his burger and I really liked the sandwich. Nothing to write home about but definitely good.   We ended up taking half of everything but the chicken dip home and our bill was around $75.   Overall, I'm glad we checked this place out bc it has a unique and cool look to it and the service was good but I'm not sure I would seek it out specifically for another night.",

Another bonus- the restaurant is big and loud, so it should be good for kids. However, the length of time made the experience very difficult with our toddlers.

We saw one table quickly get there check and leave. Another had people with their jackets on and pulled up around their faces. Not sure why they would open these when it was 40's out.  Our food was good and there was a nice draft list. We ordered an app as well and it was tasty. My wife asked if she could upgrade her side to Mac and cheese and was told yes for a small up-charge.  What we didn't know was that up-charge would be $4 more. Probably wouldn't have done it then. It was different Mac and cheese. My wife wasn't so crazy about it but I enjoyed it. It was smoky and had chunks of bacon in it. My Nashville style hot chicken sandwich was good and I enjoyed my brussel sprouts side. All in all we would definitely go back.

The food was great, and the beer selection was insane! I think the wings were a big standout. Such a good smokey flavor, you don't find ones like that often. I ordered the Smokehouse Burger, and oh man it was excellent. Cooked perfectly, and so much flavor. Seems like City Works would be a great happy hour spot.",

    "text": "It's almost there.  That's what I felt when I recently visited this restaurant.  The decor is right, the atmosphere is right and the location is right.  Just a few more tweaks to their food and the restaurant will be all the way there.  I just recently went to lunch at City Works with my usual lunch suspects and we ordered a boatload of food.  I ordered the Carolina Fried Chicken which was buttermilk breaded with house-made spicy bread and butter pickles, mustard BBQ sauce and iceberg lettuce served on a brioche bun for $13.00.  The dudes ordered the Duck Reuben with sliced duck leg, citrus tarragon apple sauerkraut, Gruyere and Russian dressing served on marble rye for $14.00.  All three of us had the Olive Oil Parsley Fries.  Therein lied one of the problems.  I'm a stickler for fresh cut fries.  Why spend all of that time developing interesting and tasty sandwiches (or \"Handhelds\", as they are called at the restaurant) only to serve them with frozen fries?  And the fries were served only a little above room temperature.  That's one of my personal pet peeves...frozen fries!  Yech!  It was lunch time and I know that time can be incredibly busy, but our server took our order, disappeared until our food was ready, delivered our food and had to be waved down for additional fixings.  No follow-up!  Too busy!  We had to do another wave down for our check.  Again, I know that you're busy during lunch time, but dang!  Can we at least have them ask us one time if we needed anything?  Geez!  So, that's why I said that they are almost there.  It's the attention that is paid to little details that sets good restaurants apart from great restaurants.  Like I said, City Works has some good ideas with regards to so many things...I just them to refine their service and several menu items.",

We opted to sit outside facing Market Square -- good for people watching.  I ordered the fish tacos; my husband ordered the duck Reuben sandwich.  He said the Reuben was lacking in the sauerkraut department, kinda the reason you order this sandwich.  My tacos?  Meh.  They were ok but I'm pretty picky about fish tacos.  Guess I didn't read (again).  They come with fried fish which I would rather they weren't.  There were 3 of them and they definitely didn't skimp on portions of fish.  They tasted ok (for fried fish) but not enough sauce or cabbage.  It also came with chips and salsa -- green not red.  All in all, it was ok, but not my fav fish tacos by a long shot.  I'd come back but order something else, as would my husband.  Oh, and all the beers are on tap, per our server, no bottles. My husband was happy about that.",

I was there and they did not have a single Hop Farm, Shubrew, 11th Hour, Roundabout, etc.  They had a single Strange Roots and single Gristhouse.  They should be absolutely ashamed for the sad selection of local beer given their name and intent.  This place is also a douche magnet.  Of all the places downtown, it seems to attract the most soulless and annoying crowd possible.  Mostly happy hours for people that have no idea what else is available downtown.    They've been open for a long time now, so the lack of local favor must be intentional or whoever stocks their beers is just completely clueless about what is happening around Pittsburgh.  I pray that this place closes so that something decent can go in to the spot.",

We called ahead to tell them we had 14 people coming, they said they'd put us on the list. When we arrived we waited 45 minutes for our table. During that time the hostess twice acted as if she had never seen us before. After we finally asked to speak with a manager we were shown to our table which had been unoccupied the entire 45 minutes we were there.   After that things were decidedly better. Our server was very attentive. Service was fairly quick and accurate. The food was good - I had the ahi tacos which had a generous amount of tuna and a decent amount of kick. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals. My son said the pork chops were good and he and his teammates liked their nachos and wings appetizers.   The beer selection was very good and the waitress was knowledgeable about the choices. Prices were a little high but not crazy. We had a good amount of food and drinks for what we paid.   Overall a good experience once we were finally seated. Why we couldn't be seated right away remains a mystery.",

The menu and beer list had something for everyone, which was great for our group!   I had a Carolina fried chicken sandwich. It was ok, but it wasn't anything to write home about. It also kind of tasted like it was sitting in the window for a little longer than it should have. Everyone else got burgers and seemed to enjoy their meal, so next time I would probably go that route.   Our server was very friendly and helpful when we had questions, and really took the time to chat. There was an awkward exchange where he counted the money at our table to make change, and I felt weird about it. I said that I felt weird out loud, and he responded really well to it and we all laughed. Which was kind of nice. hahaha   All in all, this place has a sweet beer list, and it's a great location if you are downtown exploring the city. The food was only decent, so that made my rating drop. I wouldn't write this place off though!",

    "text": "City Works is the definition of go big or go home. The bar/restaurant is HUGE - probably the most spacious of any bar I've been to downtown. The walls are lined with flat screens so you can catch all your games here while downing one of their 90 beers on tap.   I stopped in for lunch one afternoon with a group of others. You could still smell the fresh wood! Our server greeted us quickly and was very friendly throughout the visit. I could not say that all the servers were having as good of a day because I heard multiple plates or glasses being dropped and shattered.The training squad has some work to do, I guess.   We started our meal with some calamari and cheese curds for appetizers. Fried cheese really isn't my thing, so although I wasn't a fan, that's probably a purely an issue of preference.They offer multiple vegetarian options and it is clearly labeled on the menu. I tweaked the salad order a bit to make it vegetarian and add in the veggie patty as protein. It took a couple tries for our server to get it right, but they were very friendly and prompt when I had to send it back, so that was greatly appreciated. The salad was delicious! The veggie patty initially threw me off with its vibrant red color, however, it tastes a LOT better than it looks. Super crispy on the outside, but when you cut into it, there's that that soft bean texture in the center. It paired really well with the salad. The portion was also very hearty, so you will not leave hungry.  Everyone in my party was enjoying their food, until one person actually bit down on a plastic spear in his food. You know, one of those spears that should be going THROUGH your burger and not placed INSIDE of it. Don't people usually sue for this? Either way, it was pretty dangerous and definitely a choking hazard. I understand they're a new restaurant and working out some kinks, buuuut this should be unacceptable. Chew carefully, everyone!",

However, the service is slow and the food is not worth the price.   City Works is a great spot to go for post-brunch drinks, but not so great for date night. If you go when it's busy, don't expect to leave quickly. If you go when it's quiet, still don't expect to leave quickly.  I understand servers can get swamped and overwhelmed, but sitting with an empty drink for extended time isn't ideal when you're paying $12-15 for a cocktail. Appetizers are good bar snacks, but as far as full on meals, I recommend going elsewhere.",

I worked in restaurants for about 10 years and I never worked in one where they would have said to refuse to sell a $13 burger because of the time of day. I am going to get some take out at Primandi's, I guess.   Also, 9:15 is not late night. Is it?  Two stars are for great beer selection. This place needs a hospitality consultant and it might be okay.

There is something for everyone ! Next came the food. We all shared the works for the table and it was fabulous! We were a little iffy about it because soooo much stuff comes on it but it all goes together and turns out delicious. This should be split between at least 4 people. For dinner I got the Carolina chicken sandwich and it was excellent. It is a house favorite.   Atmosphere: there are lots of tvs so it would probably be a great place to watch a game! What we also like was it had large screens where it showed music videos and in between songs it would play funny videos from YouTube. Nice touch!  Service: was excellent",

Service was slow, and the salad I ordered (City Works salad) was small and unsatisfying, especially considering the price tag. Hopefully they get their menu and service kinks worked out, because the space itself is very nice and has potential. Until then, I'll be skipping this spot and heading to one of the other many, better restaurants nearby.",

When I sent it back all I received in return was I'm sorry from the waitress. Don't ask how I want it prepared if you don't know how to prepare it. I drank my lemonade while my friends ate overcooked burgers. I should of had fast food. At least it's consistent. Also this place is so entirely loud. I think they are attempting to be a sports bar. But the prices being as high as they are and the food being subpar I would have to disagree with the efforts. Two days left in the city. I hope I can find some good food. Because this isn't it",

We were a party of three. We ate outdoors. Despite a good first impression, we quickly became disappointed. It took at least 15 minutes for the server to greet us at the table. It was not busy at that time. It appeared that the servers were more engaged in socializing with each other. We ordered dinner. There were adequate selections from which to chose. The food was good and the portion sizes were adequate. We were satisfied with our selections. However, we never received a drink refill because the server never returned to inquire about refills. It took a long time to get the attention of the server for receiving the check. The lack of attentive service changed a 4 or 5-star review into this 3-star review. We might consider returning, but we would first consider other options.",

Later found an increase of $4 on bill without a description. Was told was aspagus. I explained that wasn't an extra item but a switch and that a price increase was never mentioned. Was told it was an expensive green veggie. Had to ask fur manager to remove. Server was upset & non-communicative after that. Left a small tip with explanation of dissatisfaction.",

Now I had 2 drinks on an empty stomach.  I ask for a manager, he states well she mad a mistake, I'll buy you a drink.  Smart thinking, buy a tipsy redhead another drink.  Well we finally get our table, we order drinks, me a cocktail, my husband a Guinness (which came cold), they comped the Guinness only.  The food was not worth the aggravation.  Needless to say , we won't be back.  I gave 2stats cause the bartenders were great.",

They came out pretty quickly and it was a big portion of fried cheese.  It was definitely cooked perfectly and the side of smoky tomato sauce was a tasty combination.  Our entrees were a little more on the average side.  We got the CIty Works Chopped Salad, The BBQ Chicken Salad and the Duck Reuben.  The City Works salad seemed small and insubstantial for the price, however, the taste of it was good.  The BBQ Chicken Salad was better, but still not the best combination. I could have done without the BBQ sauce, can just had regular seasoned chicken breast with all the other ingredients.  My friend liked the Duck Reuben, but thought there was too much cheese (his personal preference).  He prefers to taste the duck more than all the extras on it.   Overall the food is pretty tasty, but not exceptional.  We're not big drinkers, so we didn't try any of the beers or wines.  We would probably come back, but mostly for the fact that we can sit outside at Market Square and if other places are super busy and we can sit down quicker here.",

Neither good nor bad. The weird part was the presentation of my order. The food runner brought out a wooden plank with salmon, cipollini onion quarters, tomatoes, potatoes, and asparagus. Sounds fine, right? And that salmon was cooked perfectly. So what's not to love?  For whatever reason, the wooden plank was absolutely dripping in this white, watery stuff, and there was so much of it, it was dripping on the floor, and maybe even on the guy who brought it out. I had to use paper napkins to dry off the platter and the table so this white watery stuff didn't get on my shirt or pants. Not what you go out to eat for.  I've never had such an experience before.

We showed up with a party of 12, yes I know a party of 12 is large. We waited patiently at the bar and ordered drinks although it wasn't super busy. No problems with waiting for a large group. We got sat down after about 15 minutes. Noting wrong with that. We were seated near the bar with 2 tables together.  No complaints about that. After we were sat, we were given roughly 6 menus and 6 silverware. This is where the problems begin. We waited 20 minutes before a server came to our table. By the time the server came, everyone was pretty impatient and decided to take food and drink orders, some of us went to the bar to order our drinks to help with the tine frame everything was taking. I personally ordered all of my drinks at the bar and that was a inconvenience to say the least as the bar tenders seemed to be just as slow as the service. Anyways, my order came out wrong and once meal at our table was forgotten until everyone was almost done eating. Meals and appetizers came out at complete random. I maybe saw the server 5 times the entries experience including her taking the checks which took forever. Came here at 315 pm and didn't leave until 545 pm.",

We were promptly seated by the hostess and there we sat...and sat more, and sat some more. This went on for 30 whole minutes. Not one server ever approached us or offered the slightest bit of eye contact. We finally decided to get up and go to another restaurant in the Square. As luck would have it, on the way out the door, we happened to cross paths with one of the the managers and he asked if everything was alright. We told him no, we've been sitting for 30 minutes and not one server has acknowledged our presence, we missed any chance of happy hour and we were now very hungry.  He attempted to retain our business by offering us something, but never said what. The offer honestly could have been free dinner and beers, but I still would have walked out.   As far I as I'm concerned, City Works' opportunity to serve me dinner came and went and it will not come again. I will not return.  I see many positive Yelp reviews, so it may be a great place, but until management figures out how to manage their restaurant, it won't achieve its full potential.",

I can't see why anyone would choose to eat this food when there are so many great options for fantastic meals within walking distance from this place.

Coors light, bud light, corona, but seriously no Heineken.   The menu looked light they were trying hard to be trendy. That requires flawless execution which we did not experience. Rosemary fries with a blah blah blah. None of it matters if the fries are cold. I had filet mignonette sliders also cold. They were tasty.   The best item we had was the appetizer: fried dill pickle slices. Not so trendy but executed. They were a 10 with a beer batter that's awesome. Service was good.   All in all if you miss this place you shouldn't regret it.",

I'm a craft beer lover and work for Brew: The Museum of Beer, so I think I know a bit about craft beer. I was impressed by the selection, especially the fact that they have a decent  amount of local breweries' brews and will  continue to do so.  Alexis was our waitress and she was friendly attentive and upbeat.  We also met  Tyler the bar manager who took the time to talk  to us for a while.  I had the mahi mahi tacos.  They were great. I must admit they came out cold the first time and  I  had to send them back, but I got the replacement meal in a flash. My cousin had the pork  chop and said it was pretty darn good! I'll  be back!",

Finally had one come up to the table and she said she wasn't sure if it was her table or not and it was confusing because there was a shift change, even though I saw her talking to the table next to us and pointing at us 15 mins earlier.  I was excited to try this place even after another co worker told me when he went he sat and waited for a half hour and no one ever came to his table.  When he walked out, the hostess shrugged her shoulders and said \"sorry\" I guess telling the waitress \"you have a table\" was too difficult.  I guess everyone that was hired there, it's there first job in the service industry?  Not sure, but the manager should really read all the reviews on here.",

I had the mac and cheese with chicken and bacon the first time, and the salmon the second. The mac and cheese was a huge portion, so I was hoping the pricier salmon would include enough for leftovers, but it did not. It was a delicious and healthy lunch portion.

    "text": "I finally made it to City Works to actually try the food. We settled on city works because we could not validate being inside on such a beautiful evening.   Atmosphere and setting: City Works is a 5. It's a great place to sit outside and enjoy the great weather. It was 8 pm on a Thursday so there was a decent amount of people that had the same idea but it was not overly crowded.  As long as you are not in a rush, this is a great space to be on a nice day.   Food and drinks: Our waiter recommended we try the veggie burger and man was he spot on. Their veggie burger does not taste like a veggie burger, it does not have the texture of a veggie burger. It was so good (once it actually came out from the kitchen). I understand why they trademarked this burger. Highly suggest trying this, even if you are not a vegetarian.  It is worth it and quite interesting. Also, there is a crazy amount of beers and wines on tap to choose from. However, we were \"those people\" that opted for markers manhattan's because it was just a liquor night over beer.   Service: This is where City Works just drops the ball. Our waiter was so nice and enjoyable to speak with and we felt very welcomed in the beginning. However, we had to have waited at least 30 min+ for our food and I realize that is not his fault, but in that time we also finished our first round of Manhattans and as our drinks were getting low we were never asked if we wanted another round etc. When our food did come, we actually had to get up and go grab napkins and utensils from another table.  We also were waiting around for quite a while for our waiter to come back to give the bill. It seems this is a trend at City Works and that's kind of a bummer because the atmosphere and drinks are there. . . just get on top of a kitchen and staff's attentiveness and I think you will see an increase in the ratings.",

The filet was perfectly tender and delightful but the sliders could have definitely used more sauce (I like when it burns). The side salad was just okay. Nothing to write home about.

    "text": "After about a year of my friend wanting to check this spot out, we decided to check it out and used Open Table to make a reservation since there were events going on in the city. We arrived on time and we're seated right away. Our service was good, with a waitress who was  helpful and attentive but not checking in too often.   We had three people in our group. We started with drinks and shared the short rib poutine. With a huge list of beers on tap, we all found something to like. I don't care for most beers or ciders but they had some unique craft ciders to suit my picky taste. The poutine was delicious but the serving seemed a bit on the smaller side and all the ingredients were mixed together which seemed a bit out of the ordinary from what I usually expect poutine to look like (however I am not a poutine expert so this may be more common than I realize).   For entrees, my friends chose burgers and I chose the beet salad which is listed as a \"starter\" salad since I wasn't too hungry. The friends ate up the fries which came with their burgers and had leftovers on the burgers. The fries were very nice, and I tasted a few and can agree they have some nice fries complete with a little sprinkle of herbs. I enjoyed the beet salad, which was very fresh, fairly large (especially considering it was listed as a starter), and had lots of beets. However, they list it has pecans but I barely had one pecan in my whole salad which was a little disappointing.  Overall, I enjoyed my time at City Works but it seems a little expensive for what it is offered. I would come back, most likely for happy hour which is listed from 4-6pm on weekdays.",

My family and I were trying this restaurant out to see if we wanted to host our family reunion luncheon event here. The location is great in the middle of market square and there are other activities after we would be eating close by. So, the location is perfect for our reunion. They have outdoor seating for the summertime on the patio. The only thing is, unless you want to do a buyout it's not ideal for a large group of 30 plus we are expecting for a private space.  The service was great and our waiter was very attentive. He made suggestions and was personable so this was a plus as well.   The food however was not a 4. The food isn't bad but it isn't great either. It's just OK. They have a lot of different options like the duck Ruben and the southern fried chicken sandwich. But the taste wasn't there for me. I had the chicken sandwich with the pickles and the sauce. I have had similar sandwiches from living in Florida and the flavor wasn't even close to that. I tasted my mothers duck Ruben it's was okay but not very flavorful. Seems like they were missing something. My aunt said the same for her city burger that she got. No flavor. The fries were the frozen type, so if I eat here again I will swap sides.",

The cocktail menu has a whole page dedicated to mules!!! Oh how i love a good mule. I recommend the kentucky mule, you can't go wrong with whisky and ginger beer. Not ever.  I ordered the nashville hot chicken sandwich, my friend ordered a veggie burger.  Time to look around.  The decor is nice, the space is very open and visually appealing. the bar is bigger than the beer selection. There are TVs everywhere. The staff seemed friendly. Our waiter was nice and attentive for the most part. I had made a reservation ahead of time, and asked if we could sit outside but it got cold and windy and I changed my mind which seemed like not a big deal to them. Seated inside. Near the door. It's a very large space though and I can see them getting overwhelmingly busy during a sports ball game.  We did our best to drink our drinks quickly, we were nearly done when we ordered another round, the waiter tried to take them away, we said no way buddy we're not finished just yet.  The food came. It looked great and for the most part it tasted as great as it looked. I would not in any stretch of any imagination call this a nashville hot chicken wrap, it was good, just not nashville hot chicken good.  Our bill came. And  holy hell, I forgot how expensive things can get.  If I had to choose between city works and some other run of the mill sports bar with high price points... I'd probably just go get mexican food across the way. Maybe it's expensive because they have so much space and so many tv's. Maybe it's the location. Who knows. I just don't think for what we spent on our meal and 2 drinks it would be worth a second visit.  If you're looking for a bit of a higher end place to watch the game any game really, this might be for you.  As far as it goes for me and mine... it's a soft pass.",

    "text": "So we arrive on a Saturday evening and get a table right away. The place is half full and we are greeted by a very friendly waitress. She gives us a short background of the place and we order an appetizer and drinks. My wife orders a blue moon with an orange   The waitress offers us waters along with our drinks and we accepted. The Blue Moon arrives without the orange and she apologizes for forgetting our waters. Well a few minutes later she arrives and still does have the waters. Then my wife asks for the orange that she never received and the waitress replies \"you're going to have to give me a few minutes for that\". Okay. So then I see two waters headed our way and she gives them to the table next to us. By the way, that table arrived AFTER us. So we decide that we are leaving due to the bad service and start to walk to the front of the restaurant to pay for our blue moon.  The waitress begins to chase us saying we can't walk out on the bill. Really.  So we ask for a manager and she says she's going to get one. We run into a guy who said he was a manager. I told him what happened and he says \"maybe she was overwhelmed\". As I mentioned earlier the place was not that busy. So I asked the manager for the bill and he says don't worry about and I said \"I won't\". Needless to say I won't be back.",

Knowing that it was a busy night in the city I figured I'd call ahead and make a reservation. I was told by the person on the phone that there was no wait and when there was no wait they would not take reservations. I then hop in an Uber and get down to city works no more than 25 minutes later. I walk in and was told that there was an hour wait. I explain to the guy how I just got (for a lack of better terms) screwed because I tried to make a reservation but was refused due to me wanting a reservation for 30 minutes in advance. I was then told to leave after telling him my displeasure with what just happened. Overpriced food and their BBQ sauce underwhelms, which is what they pride themselves on. We just wanted to go for the atmosphere and beer selection, not their subpar food. If you like poor customer service this is your place, enjoy.",

The craft beer selection is impressive but the marketing folks of this chain obviously don't want you to know the size of glass they use for each of the 60 or so beers on tap. There's plenty of room in the description of each beer to note the pour size. The ABVs are all noted plainly. Most bars with good craft selections plainly state the size of glass used for each. Go figure why City Works doesn't print it on their menu. $$$$$",

The beer selection is fairly large, with many craft beers to choose from. The one thing I missed in the beer list was an indication of how many ounces they pour for the different beers. I wasn't sure with the IPAs that I ordered whether they were 12 or 16. This made it a little hard to price compare.   They have some interesting selections on their food menu, and I ordered the Carolina fries chicken sandwich, one of their specialties. I was a little underwhelmed. For $13, it was a little on the small side, and the fried chicken breast was maybe two thirds of the size of the bun, so after I got a little ways through eating the sandwich I was left with just eating pure bun (or leaving it uneaten). The bun also wasn't heated.   I came during happy hour and their specials are not quite as extensive as you see at some other places. They had $4 drafts on a select list of beers (not across the board). The bartender will list the beers for you that are on special but it was a little hard to remember them. It would have been nice to have them listed.",

    "text": "We visit Pittsburgh often, and on our most recent trip we tried City Works twice.  First, it's huge and has outdoor seating, which is great for people watching at Market Square. Their beer selection is phenomenal. We only tried appetizers and small bites, and were not disappointed. The chili is fabulous and served in a generous portion. It has sirloin beef in it and was a meal. Their fried pickles are perfect and among the best we've had. Their prices are a great value for the amount and quality that you get.  The only downside, which is why I gave them two stars, is their service.  We went two days in a row. The first time our server came right out, took our orders, brought them out, and then disappeared. She never checked in on us, and we waited a long time to get our check, causing us a delay and inconvenience.  The second time was similar. Our server came out right away, took our order for two appetizers, and after a while brought only one. I asked him if he placed the order for the missing one (chicken wings), and he said yes, and went to investigate. After about five minutes, he came out and said they were coming. I asked to pay for our orders since I had to leave soon.  More time went on, and no chicken wings. It was clear that our server lied to us, as the wings would have been out had he really placed the order in the first place. I finally had to leave for an appointment, but the server was nowhere to be seen. I had to leave the others in my party for an appointment, so never got to enjoy what I paid for.  CITY WORKS MANAGEMENT: Train your waitstaff better, including telling the truth. Your customers know when they're being lied to, and the outcome is worse than telling the truth. (Hence this review.) Otherwise, you aren't going to last. It wasn't like your place was overrun with customers to begin with at lunchtime.",

    "text": "It's nice to have a new addition to Market Square since most of the establishments there have been in place for quite some time. That being said, I think City Works offers something a little different, always a plus, but is clearly still needing to work out some kinks. My parents, brother, fiance, and I arrived a little after 12:15 on Memorial Day. The patio was entirely filled since it was such a nice day. Also, we were told they have no patio tables that fit more than 4 people. If that's True, I think that's quite a detriment since Diamond Market across the square can fit large parties on their patio. We were  sat closer to the open windows which was a nice mix of both indoor and outdoor dining. Our server was a bit slow to greet us, and when she did she said she had a party before us and would be back shortly. About 5 minutes later she came back, explained the menu a bit, and brought us all waters. After the waters were brought, she didn't come back over for over 10 minutes. In fact, I noticed at least 2 tables walk out since she had yet to wait on them. Clearly, from watching her, she was responsible for far too many tables and was very overwhelmed. We ordered all of our drinks (iced tea, diet coke, a Kentucky Mule, and a Fire Over the Hill) plus our meals at the same time. About 5 minutes later, she brings the iced tea. Another 5 minutes pass and out comes the mule. At this time we ask for the diet soda and the beer, which admittedly, she forgot. At that time she said they didn't have the Fire on the Hill so I went with Flower Power. About 5 minutes later, the missing drinks appeared.  Our food took about an hour to be delivered to the table. The food runner told us several staff called off that day so they were having a lot of issues. Our food orders came out correctly for the most part. What was ordered: 1. Grilled chicken sandwich:grilled chicken breast, applewood smoked bacon, french fry aioli, shredded iceberg, vine-ripened tomato, red onion, avocado jalapeno sauce, kaiser roll. It was ordered and served with no tomato or onion. My brother said it was pretty good, and he also liked the seasoned fries it came with.   2. Pulled pork sandwich: hand-pulled house smoked pork shoulder, housemade BBQ sauce, cider mustard, coriander coleslaw, kaiser roll. My mom really enjoyed the flavor of the pork. I had the chance to try it and it was very, very smoky! The pork was tender enough, and the housemade BBQ sauce added a nice kick. She chose a side salad as her side and it was nicely prepared with tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, and onions.  3. Shrimp tacos: crispy shrimp, Asian slaw, ginger sesame vinaigrette, black sesame seeds, Sriracha, chili aioli, white corn tortillas. My fiance really enjoyed the flavors and found them to combine for a nice spice. Three come to a portion and he was filled afterwards. Salsa was supposed to come with the tacos but was not on the plate. He was able to tell a hostess who kindly brought out the missing salsa.  4. Smokehouse burger: house smoked BBQ pulled pork shoulder, smoked mozzarella, BBQ bacon onion relish, crispy buttermilk onion strings, toasted Hawaiian bun. My dad said this was a 5 star burger! It was huge on his plate and came with a side Caesar salad.   5. Filet Mignon Sliders: two grilled filet medallions, caramelized onions, horseradish cream, pretzel roll. I asked our server what she preferred between the pulled pork and the sliders and she emphatically said she loves the sliders. She did not steer me wrong as these were delicious, and the portion size was filling enough for lunch but did not leave me overstuffed. They came out prepared perfectly medium rare as requested. I loved the horseradish sauce (I should have asked for more on the side), and the onions added a sweet contrast. The pretzel rolls seemed freshly baked and were sturdy enough to hold the medallions. The side salad was good and I really liked the white balsamic vinaigrette.   Our server was good about refilling waters and soft drinks, and also checked on us a few times after our food was delivered. There are lots of TVs so I'm sure the space gets packed during sporting events! I also like the fact they have 90 beers on tap and many of them are local to Pittsburgh! Besides the long wait for the food, the other negative was that we were charged for the beer never received in addition to the Flower Power. My dad should have checked the bill closer so he could have had that corrected at the table. Overall, the meal was enjoyable, once received, and the prices are incredibly reasonable (all of our meals were between $12-15!). If they can work out the service kinks, I think City Works will be a solid place  to visit in the future!",

Once, we were lucky to score the private dining room and it made our experience a great and intimate one. Another time, we were able to get a table and it was equally as nice of an experience. Very attentive service both times!  I've tried a few of their appetizers and each were pretty good! I particularly enjoyed the duck confit nachos. You also can't go wrong with the giant pretzel. The large selection of drinks makes it versatile and accommodating to any drink preference. However, the largest selection is that for the beer so definitely stop here if you're particularly a beer drinker! Unfortunately, the happy hour specials for beer are only for a handful of those beers, so make sure you ask which ones are on special. For the wine drinkers, the wine specials during happy hour are half off any of the wines! Great deal, right?  This will probably be the new regular hang out place for my group of coworkers!",

    "text": "It gets 2 stars because the workers at the hostess stand were very helpful and accommodating. That, the beer selection, and sports on TVs keep this from being 1 star.  We were visiting Pittsburgh and were looking for a place to watch a sporting event. City Works came up in my search so we decided to try it. We were just going to sit at the bar and have some beers and watch TV, unfortunately the bar was full. Went back to hostess stand and asked for a table in the bar area. They sat us outside the bar, but we were fine with that. When they put us at a table where not both of us could see the TV we wanted we were moved, and they changed a TV closer to us to what we were watching. Great. And that is the great ended.  Our service, in a word, was horrendous. In more than a word... We waited like 15 minutes for our server to first come to our table. Okay, we weren't in a hurry, so not a huge deal. But our server actually never came back to our table on his own. We always had to flag him down. When he brought our drinks and food he said nothing. No, here. No, do you need anything. Just, nothing. Just set it down. We'd say thank you every time and get nothing in return. No response whatsoever.  All my servers start at 15 percent, then depending on the service that goes up or down. This was one of maybe 3 times in my life that it got down to 10. I'll take into account if a server is busy and things take a while, but this server was barely at any of his tables. And the lack of any kind of hospitality on his part just couldn't redeem the place for me.   Oh, the server that filled our water glasses was great... smiling, joking with us, so kudos to her.",

It was nice and big and TVs everywhere. We were sat quickly and our waiter was friendly. We ordered Caesar salads when had a nice presentation when they came out. By the time we finished those our food was coming out. Great timing. They have an extensive drink menus as well with several beer selections. We ordered the fish and Chips and the Carolina chicken sandwich which were both very good. We have nothing to complain about with this place. Can't wait to visit again to try the ribs.",

They had nice big horseshoe booths to sit at which was great for our group. Pretty reasonable in cost as well.   The beer menu and drink menu was expansive, you shouldn't have trouble finding something you like or want to try; there is literally a drink for everyone!   I liked the food menu as well. I could have gotten a number of things and probably been really happy. I settled on the fish tacos. Delicious! Warning: they do have a kick to them so if you are intolerant of spicy food then I'd check out on if the other choices.   Waiter was attentive and chatty. The inky thing I didn't like was that he stood at the table and watched us tip him and he asked how much change I wanted back.  I'm a good tipper but I like my privacy when tipping hahaha",

    "text": "I met up with an old friend for lunch, and specifically requested we go here specifically because the website stated that they had Stone's Xocoveza (that delicious Mexican Hot Chocolate inspired Stout!), but alas, they said they had JUST run out. Fortunately, I was turned on to Southern Tier's Imperial Cinnamon Roll Ale during my visit. That's probably the highlight of my visit. It's not that the food wasn't delicious. It was!... however, I feel like I can easily find comparable quality food and similar beers for much more reasonable prices. The Firecracker Rolls we ordered were good, but almost TOO spicy to eat. I'm a spicy food lover too. For reference, I usually order a Spice Level of 7 or 8 at Thai Restaurants. We went through a glass of water and part of a refill each while tackling these, and there was not enough avocado cream to help manage them. While eating these, both of us voiced regret at having ordered spice-based drinks. The Thai Chicken wrap was very good too, but again, it wasn't outstanding. My favorite thing I ate was the Sesame Ginger dressing that I chose for my side salad. The flavors in it were exquisite! I tried a bite of my friend's Carolina Fried Chicken Sandwich too. It was good, but... missing something. I'm not sure what would have made this better. I even tried a bite with one of the pickles that come with it. Hmmm... Conclusion: This place does have pretty good food, but I'd go elsewhere next time.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I stopped at City Works for an early dinner over Memorial Day Weekend. This is a great new addition to Market Square!  Atmosphere: This may be the largest restaurant in downtown Pittsburgh. Plenty of seating indoor and outdoor. There are several very large TVs inside for sports enthusiasts. The outdoor seating, however, is much better for people watching.  Food: The food was incredible! Definitely 5 star worthy. (I'm not a snob that only gives 5 stars to high end or gourmet restaurants.) for what City Works is, a bar/restaurant, the food was perfection. Do yourself a favor and get the Firecracker Roll! There's a perfect amount of spice in this Asian inspired chicken egg roll, and the avocado sauce was sooo good. The only thing that would make this better is more avocado sauce. For the main course I had Fish Tacos. The mahi mahi was cooked to perfection! Crispy outside with a light, flakey inside. The sauces on here were creamy and delicious. The salsa with the chips was also very tasty. I can't wait to try more food from here!  Service: The only minor downfall was the service. Our waitress walked by us several times without asking if we needed anything else. All I wanted was a beer!   All in all, this place is excellent! I highly recommend City Works to local Pittsburghers. For tourists, there's plenty of other more unique food options in this city. I'll be back for sure!",

Great location right on Market Square. Some outdoor seating as well but the inside is so big it feels very open, I like it a lot.

I met a couple friends after work for dinner here and it appeared to be a popular spot for happy hour! We got 3 appetizers that were on the Happy Hour menu for $4. We had the firecracker rolls, pretzel bites, and fried pickles. They were all delicious- but the fried pickles were my favorite!!! I also enjoyed a beer from their Happy Hour Beers List, which was $4!  For my meal, I had the Carolina Fried Chicken sandwich. It was topped with spicy bread and butter pickles, which was my favorite part of the sandwich! My friends both ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken Wrap, which they said was good but was hoping it had more of a spicy kick to it.  I would come back here during happy hour for their deals and also would like to try more on the menu!",

The bartenders were all friendly and attentive. They have a lot of TVs with all different games on for the sports lovers, so that's a nice aspect for all us crazy Pittsburgh sports fans!  We stated with the chicken firecracker roll appetizer. They were okay, but the spicy flavor kind of over powered the rest of the ingredients in the roll. I had a cheeseburger and side salad, and my BF had the fish tacos and side salad. My burger was a little dry for asking it to be cooked \"medium\" and the fish tacos had a ton of breading on them which neither my BF or I cared for. Maybe ordering other menu items would have served us better. We'll definitely come back, but not order these menu items again.",

Happy hour is ok 4-6 but waiter didn't come around for last call, or the last 20 mins really  Some drinks are expensive, $11 for a glass of wine. Wouldn't suggest getting the offer on Spring rewards. It is NOT like Groupon. You pay $5, then only have one month to visit and pay another $15 to get $15 back. I've had the burger, ribs, poutine fries (frozen), fish, and all are mediocre. Service has always been decent. They will not do any substitutions, which is a big turn off! If you don't like a side you are given, you are out of luck! The \"chef\" will not do anything than what's on the menu. They would not even make a regular chicken sandwich. I don't think we'll be back",

Loud (they haven't EQ'd any of the TV audio...so basketball for example is this horrendous squeak-fest as sneakers of players are over-amplified and pumped over dozens of cheap speakers...it is truly abhorrent). 3.  Mostly lousy food and store-bought desserts 4.  Overall, dining room and bathrooms are pretty dirty and not attended to.  Loud, expensive and food lacking.  My advice: come at a less busy time, sit as far as possible from speakers...and try to ignore the grunge as you sample the nice beer selections.",

There are over 90 beers on tap, so a ton to choose from and they are $4 during happy hour.  I found the food to be a bit pricey. I paid $15 for shrimp tacos. If they weren't so good I would complain more about the price. Our waitress was super friendly and quick. We did not all arrive at once so every time another person in our party came she came right over.  There are parking garages all around. Next time I will park a bit closer. I was in a garage on the blvd of the allies. My other friends parked at Golds gym.  I will be back.",

I can't see myself picking it for any other reason besides proximity to work! It's not that I've had a terrible experience but nothing really stood out for me. I don't particularly like being squashed into their awkward semicircular booths. Somehow our party of 6 always finds itself in one of these semicircular booths. Their cocktails are ok - nothing memorable. They've limited vegetarian options so I usually get their wild mushroom bread which has been wildly inconsistent in terms of flavor. I liked it the first time but the last time it was a bit burnt and almost crunchy tostada like. Service is polite but on the past two occasions I was there, they mixed up orders. So all in all - Meh!",

The cheese curds were lack luster but we had high expectations being from Wisconsin. The firecracker rolls were pretty good and filling too. We thought it was pretty fair prices but nothing exceptional. This place was recently opened so they have some service issues to figure out but they were really attentive and tried to make up for it.",

There may be a time and place for such an establishment but for it to be allowed to take a large prime spot is Market Square, which is characterized by charm and unique establishments, is a disappointing at best. If all you want is mediocre food and beer with 3,000 video screens to distract you from your human company and an environment with no warmth or character, you found it. Downtown Pittsburgh rapid growth - slow down - you can do much better.  This one is a shame.",

    "text": "Nice upscale new sports bar in Pittsburgh's always electric Market Square. The building is huge with a lot of seating both indoors and out. Great spot to watch a game as there are massive tv's everywhere. The menu wasn't as large as I expected so I was kind of limited on options. I got a bacon cheeseburger which was cooked to my liking and overall pretty good. My buddy got an order of the smoked wings and they were outstanding. The wings come with 2 different BBQ sauces, 1 spicy and 1 sweet, both are ridiculously good. Another member of our party got buffalo shrimp and raved about it. City Works has a huge beer selection that we were all pleased with. The service left a lot to be desired (slow, forgot drinks) but I can't really hold that against them as it's only been open a month or so and it was a Pens playoff game. All in all, pretty good spot with decent food and beer.",

The draft list is impressive to say the least. 90 beers on tap with a large percentage of local and PA drafts. (East End, Church, Drai Laag, Grist House, etc) with every style pretty well represented.   We had the cheese curds (happy hour special) and the duck confit nachos. Both were excellent with generous portions. The nachos were on fried wontons which was a unique presentation that worked very well.   The restaurant was not busy while we were there but the service was incredible. The host was attentive and sat us quickly, our server was friendly and knowledgeable, and as soon as a plate or glass was empty the next employee to walk by asked if they could clear it.   Cannot wait to go back and try more of the menu and the silly awesome beer list.",

    "text": "PROS: Big space with lots of tables that would probably be good for large groups. There are a ton of TVs above the bar as well as scattered throughout the restaurant, so you won't miss any of the local games. Huge beer selection. Decent (if overpriced) appetizers. Service was pretty attentive except for when our waitress stepped out for a smoke.  CONS: Watch out for the prices. A friend was in town and we both had a tulip glass of Arsenal Picket Bone Dry cider, which is a local cider. They were $13 each, so we'd spent $26 on our first two drinks, which is more than the fancy cocktails cost. In their defense, the price was listed on the menu, but the since this is a local cider that retails for (~$6/glass at the Arsenal Cider House less than 3miles away, I was shocked at the price-gouging). The appetizer that I'd ordered (jalepeno poppers) were good if slightly overpriced. I also had a salad entree which was abundant and tasty. All told, I received a bill for $70 for the aforementioned cider, 3 beers, one appetizer, and one entree salad.   SUMMARY: I'd recommend this place if you've got a large group and someone else is footing the bill, but smaller groups might be inclined to look elsewhere.",

Both were pretty good for restaurant quality food but then I was blown away by the filet mignon sliders. They were cooked exactly the way I ordered and had a lot of flavor. The horseradish sauce was a little light, but too much might have overpowered the flavor of the meat. The fries were also good and complemented the meal well. Very trendy vibe in the restaurant and the decor was very classy. There were lots of great options on the menu and it was so hard to decide but our waitress was very helpful in recommending several dishes! Throughout the meal she was also very attentive and made sure that we had a great experience! Can't wait to return soon and try something new!!",

My friend had fish tacos and she said they were fine but they looked like something I would make in my kitchen with frozen fish sticks. I had a burger and ordered it medium. It came out well done with grey meat and rubbery texture. It boasted homemade onion straws...BAD IDEA! They were undercooked and stringy. I could not even bite through them so I had to take them all off just to be able to eat the sandwich. It was like eating a burger with dental floss. If you go there, go for a beer and the TV set up.

    "text": "I had a great experience at City Works. It was a busy Friday night and we maybe only have to wait 10 minutes for a table without making reservations. We grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited. The bartender got to us immediately. Before he even could make it back with our drinks, we were approached by another bartender. Clearly, the bartenders are great at high volume. The hostess that sat us was very pleasant. She even made a cute joke as we walked to the table saying, \"the busser is still clearing your table so we're just going to walk really slow\".   We sat down and were immediately greeted. The best part of the evening was our server. Her name was Hunter and she was exactly the type of server I love. I don't like the \"server voice\" (when their tone goes up two octaves when they speak). She got to the point and asked if I needed another drink. The more important priority! We ordered drinks and an appetizer. None of which took long or at least I though. I didn't feel rushed and got to enjoy the experience. She was efficient and not over barring. Empty glasses were removed before i even noticed. Quite stealth and appreciated.   The food was good. We shared the pretzel bites and I got the ahi salad. The cheese sauce was delicious. My salad was good. A little spicier than I'm used to for tuna, but I wasn't complaining. Took half home for later, so it was a good portion. And for downtown Pittsburgh, the price was more than reasonable.   When we were almost done, Hunter came over and apologized for our food taking so long. She said it was her fault for waiting too long in between courses. Honestly, I didn't even notice. They were busy and we were being taken care of so well that I couldn't feel impatient. Not everything has to be fast food service. I also give her some respect for owning up to her mistake and taking responsibility for it. Most servers would blame the kitchen or the crowd. But seriously, it didn't bother us at all.   I liked the open dining area and loved all the windows. Great for people watching. There were also TVs if you wanted to watch the game. But this definitely wasn't geared to just a sports crowd. The bathrooms were clean and private, especially for being such a busy night.   I had a great time and plan to go back and recommend this place to my friends!   I hope management actually reads this. I want to give major credit to the personable, knowledgeable, efficient, and attentive server we had. Thank you!",

    "text": "Where should I start.  Probably the worst restaurant experience I have had in the city of Pittsburgh.  First of all our soup,  salad,  appetizer,  and entree all came out at the same time.  Then my girlfriends salad was supposed to be a BBQ chicken salad and was far from it.  So they took that same exact salad into the back and added onion rings in an attempt to make it the salad she wanted.  It was still the wrong salad.  Now it was the wrong salad with onion rings on top.  So the bartender took it into the back again and we waited for drink refills for 10 min.  It turns out our drink service was lousy for 10 minutes because he decided to stay in the back and  eat the salad. It gets better, he then walked out from the back with salad plate in hand just chomping away while STILL not refilling our beverages. It was hard to believe our eyes.   Next I got a sub par Thai chicken wrap.  It came with stale tortilla chips instead of the fries.  And when we commented on their lousy service and overall experience,  the bartender ignored us for refills,  again.  Like we did something wrong.  The manager didn't take care of anything and actually hid from us as we left.  Thanks Allen,  for the help.  So we went to 5 guys for burgers after wasting $64.00 of my hard earned money.  Do yourself a favor and pick a different restaurant at market square Unless you feel like paying to eat a second dinner. However,  since they get one star I will mention a positive.  They have a great beer selection and lots of TVs.  That's about it.",

The person at the front never said why we weren't texted and offered us a seat al.ost i.mediatly  A spot opened at the bar while I was talking at the front, so we took it.  Ordered around 9:35 or so(time less accurate due to beer while waiting). We ordered apps, we were served around  10:15 or so.  I posted a negative Yelp review and was offered a comped meal.   We're they related?   Not sure.  The food was good, I MAY have drunk yelped(yelp is a verb right?) because I was a little annoyed.  I get it, things happen and our server was great.  I asked that our food not be comped, and they still gave it to is half off.  I take reviews pretty seriously when looking at services, therefore I try to review fairly.  I dont write negative reviews to get a call or email from the manager.   I really want others to know how I felt.   It may be naive, but I want good services because that's what the establishment offers not because their yelp raiting will go down.   I say if you have the time, give this place a chance, prove me wrong.   Why not?",

Plenty of seating inside and out. The place is bright and just a little loud, but not so much that you can't talk.  The beer list was extensive but has short descriptions of all the beers including alcohol content - a lot of interesting local brews. Also was nice that they offer a 6oz pour for all beers, so you can try some different ones without committing to a full glass.  Food was nothing amazing, but it was good. Service was excellent- our server as well as other waitstaff were all very friendly and interacted well with customers.  Overall we all enjoyed this place a lot. Will definitely return.",

The ambiance is awesome, with tables all over, plenty of tvs and lots of excitement going on.  We are soft pretzel fanatics so we started with those, which was great paired with their cheese dip.  I had their signature chicken sandwich with fries while my hubby had their house burger and both were delicious.  We never make it to dessert, especially if we get an appetizer, but some of them we saw being brought out looked delicious.  They have a ton of beer so be ready to browse the boards and pick a few out.  My hubby loves getting flights because you get options instead of having to pick just one and he enjoyed all that he got with his flight.  I would highly recommend checking this place out if in the area.  You won't be disappointed.",

We arrived around 9:30 and had a short wait.  We were greeted warmly and our name and cell phone number taken to be paged.  The wait was less than originally stated. Yay.  It was busy though.  Our party ordered chopped salad, pulled pork and wings.  The serving size is large and the wings and sauces were definitely the standout.  They have valet parking in the area for $10.00 which definitely helps.  They have lots of craft beer available but we opted for prosecco.  I definitely recommend.",

Every time I come in, it takes the server 10-20 minutes to come to my table and greet me. The past two or three times I was in, I was also charged incorrectly. One time they did not honor happy hour pricing even though my order was definitely placed during happy hour and most recently, they gave me a full beaker of wine when I had ordered the half. I didn't realize it was a full beaker until I had received the check and by then, the wine had been drank, do I didn't bother to point it out.  I spent many years of my life in front of house of restaurants, so it kills me to see an entire section of tables needing attention (some need their orders taken, some need their payment taken, some need plates removed, some need refills) while the server is MIA for more than 10-20 minutes at a time.  The only reason I go here is to sit outside,  work and people watch when it's nice out.",

    "text": "Came here on the recommendation of a friend for some food and to watch a game.   Arrived shortly before 9pm.  Waited for about 5 mins just for the hostess to show up.  Then waited another 10 mins just to get acknowledged by a server.     By the time we got to place a food order, the kitchen had shifted from their regular menu to a \"late night\" menu of 7 items (mostly appetizer style, and a burger, or a slider).   Had to step away from our table and go to the bar to order a beer, because our server never brought ours.   Didn't get the iced tea and original beer order until the food came.    Food came cold and warm (ordered a burger, pretzel bites, smoked wings, and buffalo chicken dip).  Food was average, but didn't get any utensils or napkins. Asked for them a few times before walking up to the bar to grab our own sets.     Never got a refill on the iced tea.  Walked up to the bar again for another round of beer.  When it came to close out the check, got no pen.    The place was a complete mess.   One busser spilled ranch on the floor (on accident).  Almost the entire staff walked by it, but nobody cleaned it.  Amazing nobody slipped and broke their neck.   The place was about full, with two games in, and we got last call at 10:30pm because \"managements said so\" - and even though their have closing time advertised as 12:00am.    Pretty surreal how bad everything was.   Aside from the fact that nobody cared, nobody even noticed.  It was just business as usual.  Pretty scary... and incredible this place is still in business. Would not recommend, and not coming back - as there were many other nice places in town.",

    "text": "We decided to eat at Market Square before the Steelers game and City Works caught our eye. It looks AWESOME from the sidewalk! An entire wall of huge TV's and a large bar with 90 beers on tap! It's a sports lovers dream come True... or so we thought.   We expected to have a long wait on Sunday because downtown was so busy with people coming in early for the football game and shopping at the Christmas Village in Market Square. We gave ourselves about four and a half hours before kick off. City Works wouldn't give out a wait time, but put us on the list to text us when our table (for two) was ready. We walked around for over an hour without receiving a text and decided to go back and check the list. As we approached we could see at least 7 empty booths and several empty tables. I walked in and asked where we were on the list and they never checked, just immediately sat us in a booth. I have nooooo idea why they were taking names/numbers and not texting anyone when tables became available. I'm sure they lost A LOT of business.  The place was soooo filthy. I was giving them a pass, because it was truly packed an hour earlier and I figured they just hadn't had an opportunity to clean up after the dinner rush. WRONG. I watched the hostess continuously brush every crumb and napkin on the ground as she gave no effort into brushing off tables and no one ever attempted to clean up the floor. The people in the booth beside us still had lettuce on their table when they sat down and complained. It was really bad.  We each ordered a beer and meals. They were out of both the beer and dinner that my boyfriend ordered. So he really struck out. He did land on a backup beer and a burger, while I ordered the fish tacos. It took about an hour for our food to come out, despite the place clearing out substantially. Our waitress was really great. She was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. However, she couldn't make up for the slow kitchen or how over priced the food was. Don't get me wrong the food was okay, just not $65 dinner-for-two good. There are easily 100 other options in the city with a similar price point and better quality food.   City Works really needs someone to come in and fix the front house issues. There is no excuse for not seating the people you put on your list when it's 1/4 empty or having filthy(!!!) tables and floors. We're sports bar people and this completely missed the mark. It's trying way too hard to be a sports bar with higher end food, but the food here isn't worth what you're paying for.   I recommend maybe grabbing a drink here, but eating elsewhere.",

He is attentive, quick, funny, and probably the best staff that we have ever had at any restaurant.   Four stars because the food is over priced for the portions. Plus the food is not high end.

The fries were also very soggy. My friend ordered the chicken tinga tacos and the were actually pretty good.

    "text": "For some odd reason, I couldn't remember why I was so \"eh\" about this place. At first glance, a place that touts itself as being a sports bar with a large craft beer menu always calls my name. As soon as I clicked to go to the business page, I found my friend's review that flipped the lightbulb immediately on why I feel the way I do about City Works.  My friend and I arrived about an hour and a half before the game to grab a drink and a light snack. While there were no seats at the bar, we were sat immediately at the end of a long table in the bar area. Our server came around and quickly grabbed our drink orders. We wanted to split an app, and she recommended the goat cheese flatbread. Our beers came quick and the flatbread followed soon after. It was fabulous!  After we received our flatbread, our waitress was nowhere to be found. We wanted another round before we headed off to the game, and although we placed the drink order quickly, it took nearly a half hour for the drinks to arrive. The time spent made us late to the game, and we couldn't even find our server within that time period to tell her never mind. The drinks are also on the expensive side. I purposely chose an 11% beer so I would feel like I was getting my money's worth. (Side note: bad idea.) They did hold onto my credit card, which I greatly appreciate.  I probably would have given 4 stars if my server was a little more present. Maybe I just received the short end of the stick. The food I received was delicious. If asked, I wouldn't rule out trying here again, but with Pittsburgh being a growing food & alcohol scene, they didn't wow me enough to prioritize going there again before trying somewhere new.",

City Works is a fantastic place IF you like to play hide and seek with your waitress. If you want food, or even a beer in less than 30 minutes, you should look else where.  We sat down in the outside area on a Sunday. Including us, there were probably 20 people total in the entire restaurant. After 10 minutes, a waitress appeared. We asked a simple question about an appetizer, which overwhelmed her. We gave her the benefit of the doubt, and just ordered a beer. A simple draft beer.   Twenty five min passed.  I walked indoors, asking if anyone could get us water, beer, whatever. Embarrassed, the hostess said she'll send her right back out.  Five more minutes passed (we were her only table).  We calmly got up, and left.   Summary? Maybe this place has good food? Possible, but we never got past getting poured a glass of water, much less a beer.   We went across to diamond grill, ate, drank, and paid my bill before that waitress ever came back lol. ::Facepalm::   Just don't even come here. Don't.",

Since it was so nice out, we sat on the patio which is a great location for people watching in Market Square. The inside of the restaurant also looked really nice and spacious.   For drinks, I started with the basil lemonade. It was so pretty when she served it to me with a huge basil leaf! The taste of it was just OK for me- I couldn't really even taste the basil! We also ordered an app off the \"Bar Bites\" section of the menu- which I think just means they are smaller. Both Chris and I were swooning over the firecracker rolls! They were in an egg roll wrapper with spicy chicken and veggies inside and topped off with an avocado cream sauce. Seriously amazing! For our entrees, we both ended up ordering the fish tacos. It came with 3 breaded mahi-mahi fish tacos and chips and salsa. These were also amazing! I typically order grilled fish tacos so it was a nice change from my usual order.   The only reason City Works didn't receive a 5 star for me is because of service. Our waitress wasn't very attentive to us so we didn't even end up ordering a second drink! Hopefully on our next visit (which there will be one!) we will receive better service.",

    "text": "This is the second time I ate here. I won't count the first one as it was opening weekend and places usually need time to figure things out.  However this time was not much better. The staff was nice enough however the food leaves much to be desired. I ordered the Grilled Chicken sandwich. With my first bite I realized it was cold. I asked the server if it was supposed to be cold and she said no. It wasn't warm at all. I opened the sandwich and it is clear that the chicken is not actually grilled, but was precooked and just thrown on the grill to get some dirty grill marks. I will post the pic if I can. Anyone who has ever grilled a piece of chicken knows what it should look like. The server offered to have the kitchen prepare a new sandwich for me but I did not have time to wait because I had to get back to work. Fortunately they took it off if the bill, but still... I did not try my girlfriend's burger, but she was not impressed with it.  Overall a disappointing meal with overpriced drinks. It's sad that this is what is happening all over Pittsburgh.",

As we were being seated we were given the late night menu...it was only 8:00. The hostess said they had to switch to that menu because they ran out of everything. And of the limited list of food on the menu, they ran out of half of that, too. Really??!  Our waiter comes over, super nice guy, and apologized for the limited menu but said they were crushed on Saturday for the Pitt homecoming game, and then the Sunday Steeler game. Did the management not know how to plan for a busy weekend??? OK, so we order what we can since it was getting late and we just wanted to eat. The food took FOREVER and was not good. The Nashville Hot Chicken sandwich was so doused in hot sauce it wasn't edible (and this is a crew that loves hot and spicy); the filet sliders were OK, but looked liked they were cooked the day before, and the burger I ordered didn't come out until everyone was done and we were getting ready to leave. We asked to see the manager, who was a really nice guy and very apologetic, and he was nice enough to pick up the tab for our entire bill. Sorry, great atmosphere and location, but we won't ever be back. This place needs to seriously get their act together.",

One sip, and already having been waiting for a long time, decided we didn't want to stay. The food may be spectacular, but for somewhere not busy and with such an expansive bar you expect better drinks and faster service. Especially in Pittsburgh. A lot of employees stood around due to not being busy. Paid for the one drink, cancelled our appetizer, and left. Totally disappointing. Worst $11 I've ever spent, honestly.  Also, tried to order a drink and they were out of the liquor on a Friday... don't recommend a drink if you don't have it! Also, who doesn't stock their bar in time for Friday?",

It's a HUGE place in Market Square, so I imagine there are not many times throughout the day that you'd have much of a wait to get seated.  I've had a few dishes here. For the apps, I'd definitely recommend the pretzels and beer cheese, as previously stated, as well as the friend pickles. I've had the Peppercorn burger and the Fried Chicken sandwich and was very happy with both. You can easily get a great lunch for around $15.  During my latest visit, our server was Demond and he was an absolute joy! We were seated in one of the private rooms near the bar and he was extremely attentive throughout our entire meal. The manager, Bobby, even came out to check on us and make sure everything was OK. Our service was marvelous, especially for it being such a busy place. Thanks, Demond & Bobby!",

    "text": "Downtown definitely needed a place like this- tons of huge televisions make it perfect to watch a sports game and they had over 50 beers on tap! We visited on a Wednesday for some late night drinks and snacks. Most of their beers are written on the menu and on their large drink board, however there were some seasonals that were not listed. I had to ask two servers what the seasonal beers were and neither of them knew without having to go to the bar to ask. I hate to be picky, but I do think that a place that wants to specialize in beer should ensure their servers at least have the seasonal beers written down somewhere so they can ask simple questions like that. Otherwise, the servers were pleasant and provided great service. I ended up choosing Space Dust by Elysian Brewing, which is always a good choice. For snacks, we went with the buffalo chicken dip and bier cheese and pretzels off of the late night menu. They were both very good, although some chicken pieces in the dip were much too big to eat with a chip. I guess that proves it's house made though, which is a good thing. The bathrooms were pretty gross, as a side note. Overall, I would return for a game and to check out their dinner menu. Hoping I am more impressed when I come back!",

The beer list alone is a great reason to stop here as they have over 70 beers on tap. The buffalo chicken dip and crab dip were outstanding as were the cheese curds. I had a wedge which was good, your standard wedge salad. Other people said that the burgers they had were amazing as was the fried chicken sandwich. Service was above and beyond great as well. The only complaint is that we asked to keep three separate checks in our big group and the waitress didn't accommodate that. It created a bit of mayhem (mostly because some in our party are cheapskates). Otherwise, great meal and great atmosphere!",

I thought the firecracker rolls were pretty good, they are super spicy and I was not prepared for that.   They offered a late night menu which we ordered from; the menu offerings address most dietary needs and are unique enough to be remembered the next day. These include :   Pretzel Bites *V  Firecracker Rolls Popcorn Chicken Kung Pow Cauliflower   And they offer a burger  for your late night meat craving.   You won't be disappointed by their beer offerings as they have 90 beers on tap and assorted wines, as well as cocktails.   Tip: they serve water at request only",

    "text": "Busy, spacious bar in Market Square in downtown Pittsburgh. Bustling, happening place around lunch on a work day. Standard pub fare at standard prices. Good for groups given their open layout and large, high tables.  I got a really interesting cauliflower steak dish. It was basically a large, steak-shaped piece of cauliflower with greens and peppers on top and some sauce. Nice healthy, vegetarian option at a pub with an otherwise meat-heavy menu. Tasty although the flavoring could have been stronger. My girlfriend got the sirloin sliders, which were slider sizes and shaped but had steak in them rather than burgers. Nice twist on the usual arrangement. Sirloin is good but a whole steak is sometimes too much so the sliders were a good size. Came with fries which were average.",

    "text": "Group of friends and I walked into here on a busy Saturday afternoon and surprisingly were seated right away. Wish we had turned around earlier and went somewhere else as we were really looking for some good food.   So, first off, this place needs to definitely step their game up with customer service. We saw our waiter maybe 2-3 times during our entire two hours at the restaurant... that is ridiculous. We would never be able to located him when we needed something for the table so had to end up asking a different employee every time. I would only recommend this place just because they have close to 100 beers on tap but other than that, the food is below average bar food. I had gotten the veggie burger (not on the menu as the impossible burger was out of stock so this was the temporary replacement). It was one of the worst veggie burgers I ever had; very bland and no sauces in the burger. We had gotten cheese curds for the table (very greasy) but my friends did enjoy their wings and baked mac and cheese.   On top of all this, I noticed a couple days later that they had overcharged me by $10. I called and they said it was probably just a mistake and they refunded me the difference. There are a lot of other restaurants in this area with much better food. If you want a quick craft beer this is the place to go, if not go visit elsewhere.",

We spotted this while strolling through the square and the atmosphere and esthetic sold us. It's so beautiful inside, and has a beautiful patio. We opted for the patio and it was the perfect romantic spot. My husband got the ribs and I got the salmon - SO delicious. We got the Nashville Hot Popcorn Chicken as our app and it was delicious.  The prices are affordable but the feel of the restaurant makes you feel more upscale. Great service. Great food. They claimed to make everything fresh and from scratch and I could definitely tell - everything tasted amazing. We would recommend!! I'm going to post some updated menu pics since the ones on here are no longer accurate!",

    "text": "Located in Market Square. Very new and clean facility with lots of open space so you don't feel crowded at your table. Lots of beer options as well as apps, salads and entrees. Small children's menu available as well. We got seated right away on a Sunday around Noon. We attempted to get a table for 4 a couple weeks ago on a Saturday night and the wait was 1.5 hours so I strongly recommend a reservation if you plan to go at a peak time. Lots of TVs all around the restaurant.   The Buffalo Shrimp app was very good but with only 5 shrimp for $14 dollars, I was disappointed.  I don't eat meat so was cautiously excited to try the Impossible Burger! It was delicious! The side salad that it came with as a sub for fries was however, the smallest side salad I've ever seen. Considering it was only lettuce, cucumbers and tomatoes, I'm not sure why it was so tiny. I also think our food sat for a little while before coming out since it was a little cold. They also forgot one of our parties orders completely.  Overall, my food was good and the atmosphere was nice. However, the service wasn't fabulous, the food only sort of fresh and I thought the prices a little high. I can see why the overall rating right now is 3/5. I'd definitely come back though because it was overall good but I might prefer trying another new place first.",

    "text": "Ok, this is going to be a very mixed review; I'm going to split it in two sections and explain my poor rating. I legitimately feel bad about giving one star, but, I hope all that read understand why.  I seek to write honest and forthright reviews based on my personal experiences without outside influence.  On that note, I'm sorry to write this review.   I arrived with a party of six on \"take your kid to work day\" in the 'Burgh.  Here we go:  The Good: the food is pretty decent fair, but it does not warrant the prices.  But, that's ok, it's only a few bucks more than everyone else and offers a superior environment. The wait for food was exceptionally long, but, the restaurant solidly acknowledged that and discounted our food without request. I have to give them a lot of credit, it was incredibly kind and considerate of them to take care of us in such a manner. Kudos to their waitstaff and management.  Rarely will an establishment adjust a tab, without request, for the sole purpose of keeping patrons happy so they come back again. Very cool!  The Bad: When ordering, I explicitly stated that my six-year old son could not have cheese on his kid-burger as it would immediately be sent back. Well, it showed up with cheese. I get that, it happens. I used to serve tables too. It was sent back. When we received it back a few minutes later we realized that they had taken the burgers back and hand-scraped the cheese off of them.  Particles of cheese were duly noted by my kid and I.   You can't do that.   You cannot do that EVER.   RESPECT DIETARY REQUESTS; FAILURE TO DO SO CAN HURT PEOPLE  Food Safety Fail = 1 Star Rating",

It's a large space with a ton of tvs to watch basically any sporting event going on. They have a huge beer list which was awesome as well. They have a decent menu, but to be honest, for the small amount of food we received, this place is way too overpriced. We ordered the mushroom flatbread and buffalo chicken dip to share. We also ordered a Caesar salad. The salad wasn't even cut and came out as huge leaves we had to cut ourselves which was kind of unusual. The flatbread was delicious I can say! I loved the goat cheese and truffle oil on it and I'm also not even a fan only mushrooms haha. The buffalo chicken dip was good but we both thought it was entirely too spicy. I also got a flight of beer and enjoyed the beer.",

They have a really amazing beer menu, and if I hadn't been going back to work, I probably would have tried a couple.    The reason I'm giving only 3 stars is because it's REALLY pricey for bar food.

My friend got an order of fried pickles and said they weren't very good and the music is loud if you are just trying to get a nice dinner. Our server was awesome though! So friendly and welcoming!",

They need to transition to real burgers (hand-formed) and actually grill the raw meat. Aside from the burgers I would go back.",

Place was pretty full on a hockey night.  Host and hostess were very friendly and promptly seated us. Our food was out quick too. Wife had wedge salad and I had a bowl of clam chowder.  We split fish tacos.  The wife reports the salad was very good. My chowder was loaded with clams and was also very good. We would both order respective things again.  The fish tacos were good I especially like the pico, and would order it again.  Pico was a little bit for the wife and she would not order it again.   Our waitress Ester Le was great. Knowledgeable on the menu great personality and attentive to our table on a busy night.  Our drinks never went empty.  She is a very good waitress.   Deserts may bring us back as they sounded great.  They have a big beer selection but neither of us drinks beer.  Worth a visit",

Proceed into this wonderful establishment with about 70 beers on tap. Flat screens all over for game time. Great menu with prices expected to pay for a establishment of this magnitude. I'm personally on what is called a beer flight, to where as I try a beer for the day and write about it along with the experience at the time on my Untapped & Beer Citizen app. Further, I look forward to always coming to City Works - Pittsburgh to chat with the wonderful staff.

The host seated is promptly. Our server was over quite promptly as well and was very nice. My husband ordered the chicken wings and the fries pickles. I ordered the ribs. Our food was out in a reasonable time. My husband enjoyed his choices. Unfortunately, my ribs were way over done and I was barely able to cut them. It took a little while before our server was back so that I could mention the issue. Once I mentioned it he was very apologetic and offered to have it remade which was nice. I decided against it. Shortly thereafter the manager came over and asked what the problem was and I explained to him as well. He was very courteous. In the end, they removed the food from the bill without hesitation. Overall our experience wasn't terrible here but the food was not stellar. If you are just going for drinks it is definitely a nice place with a nice atmosphere and good customer service. The three stars is strictly due to the food experience.",

    "text": "Charged for double shot of liquor when ordered a single.  Third visit here. Always seated fast but takes a long time for waitress to come to table. Based on the menu listing liquor is served by ounces, your typical single or double shot. Ordered a single shot neat. Other drink order at the table was the same but on the rocks. After a long wait both drinks came on the rocks. No biggie so I believed plus drinks took too long to come. When received total bill all drinks were charged at the double shot/ounce rate of $12. When I asked why,  the waitress explained that because the drinks were on the rocks that they had to make it a double. When I explained that I never ordered ice, and that this should've been explained, as the menu makes no reference to the price being based on ice with the drink or not, she agreed that she should've explained when I ordered and offered to have a manager speak with me. The manager explained that the price I was charged was not based on the ice but instead that I did not order a mixer with the drink. He explained that if you order a drink straight you have to get a double. If order a drink with a mixer you have to get a single shot. When I asked him to explain why that is not specified on the menu he agreed that it should be. When I asked if it's not then why aren't servers mandated to explain to customers he acknowledged that they should. At this point I asked if I could be charged the lesser rate for each drink and he stated no. When I explained that their charges on my bill were deceptive and unfair he simply informed me that nothing could be done. I also explained that I ordered the same drink on a previous visit and was charged the single shot rate. He stated he could not change the bill. I had not yet started to drink my last drink so I then asked if he could take it back as I was unwilling to pay for it. He informed me that he could not because it was already poured and now contaminated and they could do nothing with it. At this point I told him that he either had to remove my last drink that I had not started to drink or call the police as I was not going to pay any portion of the bill unless it was removed. He agreed to remove it. I paid the double ounce price  for all other drinks even though when I ordered that is not what I ordered. The waitress then asked me if he helped and I explained to her that he did not. She informed me that the next time I came that she would provide fantastic service. I informed her that unfortunately I would not be returning.",

With a massive selection of beers on tap, phenomenal drink and food specials, and a massive set up of tvs, tables, and amenities its no wonder this place is as popular as it is. As I said before this place has a massive drink selection, from stouts to lagers to liquors this place has everything as well as a few beers you'd only be able to find here (due to agreements with breweries/special editions). That being said though, as phenomenal as the drink and food menu specials are my only gripe is with the food itself. Although not inherently bad, it basically is just the food you would get at Fridays except with better presentation to make it seem like its higher quality than it is. That being said though, I still recommend going here, like I said you wont be unhappy and you will certainly find something to drink as well as something to snack on.",

I give two stars only because of management's positive response to a service disaster. I doubt we will return, all the same.  We have been to City Works three times.  The first time was for drinks outside and it was fine. The prices are a little high, even for Market Square.  The second time was for a light meal and though service was slow, everything went generally well. The food is average.  We went for a light meal, our third visit. The place wasn't busy.  The three of us were seated quickly, then waited. We placed a drink order, then waited a long time.  We placed a food order. The appetizer, fried pickles, arrived quickly and was good. A little expensive at $7 for the size, but good.  The food order apparently went into limbo and the waitress was in the witness-protection program.  After a long wait, I tried to find her. No luck.  I asked a hostess to help. A host came over, then the manager.  The food order finally arrived. The macaroni and cheese was good, the shrimp tacos were greasy and left unfinished, and the third order was so fouled up by the waitress that I ended up having French fries as dinner and sent the rest back.  The manager returned, erased our bill and gave us a gift card for a future visit.  He and the hostess and host did all they could but it was a lousy night.  If you go: make it clear up front that you can't wait forever. This wasn't European-style relaxed dining.  We endured a service disaster on the night before we took our son to college and it ruined the night.  I'm not one to complain, stuff happens, but the waitress basically showed contempt for the customers and that's not acceptable.  P.S. They were out of the beer I ordered so I then ordered the house beer. They were out of the house beer too! On a MONDAY!",

    "text": "I have to be honest- I went here last night and as soon as I walked in it was packed and the ambiance was great. It was high energy and looked like a great sports bar. I was so excited to try this place for the first time as it's in my favorite area of town, market square.  I found my friends and realized they had wine on tap- love it.  I ordered a Cabernet and couldn't wait to catch up with friends. When the waitress brought over my Cabernet, I took a sip and it was cold....yes, the RED Cabernet was COLD. I asked the server why it was cold and she said because it's on tap. WHAT?! That makes no sense. I'm a wine snob and have had wine on tap in numerous cities around the country and NEVER have I EVER had cold red Cabernet before. You can change the temperature on the tap settings. Most red wine should be room temperature. It changed the taste of the wine completely.  The food was mediocre. I got the Duck Ruben and had to switch it for the chicken Caesar salad which was much better.  Other than that, the service was great. Couldn't complain about our server because she was very accommodating and very nice. Hope this place makes some little changes cause I think it could be a hot spot since it's in the perfect area.",

Amazing soft pretzel appetizer! Took about 15 minutes from order to receiving. Cheese sauce is incredible. She put in our fish tacos and steak sliders and we waited. And we waited. 45 minutes later, our orders arrived. Tea refills were super slow as well. His sliders were well seasoned and although just barely warm, fries were hot. The fish in the tacos was cold. No ketchup for fries and it seems understaffed. Hunter was super sweet but 2 hours for 2 people?!",

While marketed as a sports bar with 90 or so beers on tap and multiple large screen TVs... the menu doesn't match... nor does the occasional DJ spinning giving it more of a nightclub feel.   I understand the modern day sports (wo)man may have a more sophisticated palate... I'm not sure they're interested in duck confit as they're watching the Steelers and chugging beers. Aside from my opinion of the menu vs atmosphere, the menu lacks uniformity and consistency - it feels like a weird mix of items.  Also the three or so times I've been there, the food has come out long after we ordered.   The plus side is the food is good and there is a lot of space.",

Everything about the place was pretty cool as we entered and was seated, we even got some recommendations from the greeter.   Once we got in and placed our order things changed a little.   I asked for a beer in a pint glass rather than a snifter. Personally I prefer not a snifter and tulip, but would take anything else. I was told that I would not be served my beverage so I then pruned back my order to just an entree rather than getting an app.   I ordered the cracked pepper burger or whatever and asked for medium, it came out well done. NOT EVEN CLOSE.   On top of that our server was a little rough, not very pleasant. I will say the other servers around us were really nice. I would have rather had anyone else.   Try some other place in the square first, not this place that is too snobby to serve a customer.  Update!- they keep reaching out months later with no plan nor reparations. They've logged the issue which the manager clearly doesn't understand. Maybe new managers would help the place out since carina and Lee can't figure it out. It's a shame I can't rate lower because they don't deserve one star",

It took about 20 minutes for the waitress to bring us our drinks. She initially had us waiting just to come back after so long to say that the beer we ordered was not available.  I asked for a sample of the cider and the waitress dropped it off and never came back until after we were finished eating to ask if I liked it.  She did sit down and explain that she was the the only one working the patio which was considerate, however, unless she was busy somewhere else I did not see her tending to other customers enough to justify our wait time.",

    "text": "Located in the heart of Market Square, City Works is a great hang out spot and restaurant that has something called the beer Bible, over 98 beers on tap as well as wine on tap. Yes, you read that correctly - wine on tap. It's delicious. Of course, I had to try for myself. It would only be fair to my Yelp followers :-). I arrived ari 6 o'clock on a Thursday evening, I was with a colleague and we were able to walk right in. We were seated right away, but nobody came up to us for about 10 minutes. It seemed as though they were a little bit understaffed. A lovely girl named Rachel helped us and she was wonderful. Both the hostess & server asked if it was our first time and they explained the entire menu. We also got there during happy hour. Happy hour is during the week from 4 to 6 PM. They have discounted drink prices as well as four dollar appetizers on the happy hour menu. We decided to get pretzel bites to start out with & we each got a drink. My colleague ordered the salmon as I ordered the seared ahi tuna salad. We waited for quite a bit, and our pretzel bites came out with our food. Truly not the order we wanted. We wanted this pretzel bites to come out as an appetizer because it is-followed by our meals. When my salad got there I no longer wanted the pretzel bites. The salad was delicious. Heavy on the lettuce, but had a decent amount of tuna. They also put crispy strips on it which I wasn't a fan of and if I went back for that salad I would have them hold the crispy's. There was a good mix of almonds, cabbage, avocado, and lettuce in there. My colleagues salmon looked delicious and he said it was great. Overall, it was a good experience. We were there for less than an hour and a half. The prices are really reasonable. Our bill was $60 before tip. It took a while to get our check, but I think it's because our server was busy with other tables. I'm sure it would be a better experience if they weren't so understaffed, but the food wasn't bad. The environment was fun, the place was busy and the wine on tap was delicious and plentiful. Everything was super affordable. I am not sure about the parking situation because we walked, but it is nestled in Market Square so you might have to find public parking.",

    "text": "We decided to check this place out after asking many local people where to watch football the next day before the Steelers night game, and everyone mentioned this place. The beer menu was very cool, so many choices, right up our alley as my boyfriends for Cleveland's Winking Lizard which is a similar concept! LOTS OF BEER! We also loved how many visible tvs were on and how many different games were being shown. I hate when bars play the same thing on every single one of their million tvs. We started at the bar which was about 3 people deep as it was a busy football Sunday but the bartenders still managed to take care of us pretty quickly which is impressive. After we finished our second round we cashed out to meet up with our friends, who it turns out, had put their name in for a table there. So we turned around and waited with them for a table. We were not hungry as we had had a huge lunch but our friends ordered food, a burger and a chicken sandwich. My friends said the burger was good, the chicken sandwich was okay, but the fries were killer. So I tried a couple of her fries and agree, soooo good! They are like rosemary fries which just have so much delicious flavor. I regret not stealing more fries before she let the server take them away, what a waste :(   We were still there at shift change so we cashed out with our server, he said the new server for that section would be over if we wanted additional drinks, we waited for a while but then our friends left because they had somewhere to be and didn't need the second round of drinks anyways. Cory and I waited for about another 30 minutes with no drinks or no sign of the new server and we were unsure about who to ask so we just went back to the bar, ordered a couple more drinks and stood to watch the game. Which actually was better because our table was between two tables of Ravens fans who knew each other and probably should have been cut off because they were so loud and obnoxious. I'm all about supporting your team and as a Steelers fan who lives in Cleveland I totally get how hard it can be, but to be instigating fights and darting around the place yelling, I don't think it was very appreciated by the other patrons, but definitely not us who felt like these guys were yelling in our ears. So probably should have never left the bar in the first place, but our friends had to eat and the bar was full. I would like try more of the beers and I definitely want more fries but I hope to visit again on a less busy day...if there is one.",

We got seated right away both times.  -They have about 20 TVs so it's a great place to watch sports ... if they have your channels.  -100-ish beer taps. -Duck nachos were delicious.   Cons -  -Even though we were seated right away, it took forever to get to the hostess, both nights. They seemed to be a bit overwhelmed - maybe a better computer system would help them? -They don't have the SEC network. I realize PA is not near the SEC but its the biggest football conference - can't really call yourself a sports bar without all the big sports channels. We ordered drinks and were ready to watch the UGA/Vandy game and were told they didn't have that channel. We paid for our drinks and left -We went back the next night - to watch Sunday night football and the Braves. They played both of those which was great, but they were out of like half the food menu. I realize it was a busy weekend however they didn't seem to be prepared for it at all.   Service was average. They were very busy, so it was a tad slow and jumbled, but understandable for busy nights.   All in all, there are better places to eat/drink/watch sports in Pittsburgh. We ended up going to Urban Tap over on East Carson on Saturday night and it was a MUCH better experience (and they had SEC network!)",

Over 90 beers on tap-beer lovers dream!!! I created my own flight of 4 six oz. pours which was kind of expensive. BUT WORTH IT! They have some flights already created you can order but none of them interested me. I got the filet sliders for dinner served in a pretzel roll with fries and OMG probably one of the top meals I've ever had. I would order it again and again. If you love beer and good food, go here! It's a little pricey and it was LOUD but it's nice to splurge and you get used to the noise and atmosphere. Highly recommend.",

The atmosphere is very modern, clean  and a large open space. It would be ideal for a happy hour with a group of friends! As soon as we walked in I was like \"wow!\". They have a HUGE selection of beers. Literally something for everyone. It was hard to decide which to try with so many options, I wish I could have tried one of everything!  Our server was super friendly and easy to chat with. My only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is because I have never been to City Works. So when I went to the bar when I first got there I asked the bartender \"what IPAs do you have?\" (At this point I was unaware they had so many choices). Instead of nicely saying that, the bartender worked rolled his eyes and pretty much threw the beer menu at me. Not very welcoming :) other than that it was a great experience and we will be back!",

Surprised to see Poros on Market Square is closed, but we decided to try the sports bar, City Works, nearby. I'm pretty easy to please so my filet mignon sliders were fine, although they seemed more medium than medium-well...but still tasty. Only complaints are one slider seemed to be thin on the horseradish cream, and the fry portion is anything but generous.  Unfortunately the better half's shrimp salad was a disappointment to her. The shrimp were fine, large and tasty, but the bed of kale was a bit chewy and didn't seem to go with the rest of the salad.   I'd say I'm between a 3 and 4 stars on this but drinks were good and service was fine, so I'll go 4 stars.",

The red coulis that came with the curds was amazing as well. Our friends got wraps which looked like a great choice. Next time I would have gotten a wrap and the Hazedelic Beer but it had run out. Great place to eat and watch the game!",

Since it was the middle of the afternoon we didn't order any entrees. But I did order the soft pretzels bites as an app and they were yummy.

The hostesses are very disorganized, and we once waited half an hour to be seated while there were dozens of empty tables...and the kicker is that once the hostess finally brought us to our table, she wouldn't let us sit down because it needed cleaned (why would you not do that beforehand?? or else let us sit at one of the many other clean, empty tables?) and brought us back to the hostess stand to wait for an unspecified amount of time yet again. We left at that point.... Another example of the bad service here is the one time my boyfriend and I were talking about how inedible the Nashville hot chicken wrap is due to its extreme spiciness (and we both love spicy food!), and the bartender who took our order mentioned after we ordered and eaten that everybody gets the sauce on the side because it's too hot to eat as is... like cool, you couldn't have mentioned that when we were ordering?

    "text": "I liked City Works.   Whenever I go to a restaurant I judge it, basically, on 3 things.   1. Food: 3 stars. I got one of the \"house favorite\" items, the smokehouse. It was decent, but it didn't blow me away. I don't think I'll ever stand in the center of Market Square and say, \"I'm really craving some City Works food right now...\" The smokehouse was a creative menu item, and it sounded good. It was good...it just was average. Portion was also meh (but I like to eat a lot). Price point is what you would expect for downtown with my burger being $16. No doubt overpriced, but I was willing to shell out a little extra (well, I had no choice anyway) because the atmosphere was incredible.   2. Atmosphere: screaming, screaming 5 stars. Honestly, I love the look and feel of this place. It would be a great place to meet up with friends in the city, and it's conducive for that. Seems like you can hang around in there for a while, if you'd like. The design is open and open to the outside too with various doors and skylights. You can appreciate the city while being in a very updated space. If you like watching sports... there are TVs everywhere. Trying to think of a way to clear it all out and just live in there...  3. Service: 3 stars. Our waiter was nice. I liked him. But a huge annoyance to me is that end of the meal time when you're ready to pay and no one is around to bring you your check. My friends and I were contemplating just leaving. Maybe I'm being selfish. Maybe this was this guy's first night, and maybe he was struck with the nerves and found himself stuck on the pot. Who knows. All I know, is we were trapped. We did get out eventually, though (don't worry). And we did see the waiter (so he made it through his deal too).   *Notable 1 star, crappy moment (no pun intended): The table next to us...screamed in my ear for the entire duration of my City experience. This is not the restaurant's fault, and I don't hold it against them. But let this be a reminder to all of us to never be THAT table. No one likes that table.   If you can do simple math, I'll save you the calculator time that I endured, my restaurant experience was an averaged 3 star experience. BUT if you go to just socialize and meet with friends, you're sure to have the 5 star experience. Give it a shot!",

    "text": "It's well on its way of becoming one of the best sports watching bars in the city, with an abundance of large screen TVs mounted above the vast, copper-topped bar area and ~90 beers (and wine!) on tap. It's positioned nicely for a downtown happy hour with its bright, modern space that draws a diverse mix of working class folk. The 4-6PM window is go time for $4 apps + (select) taps. The cheese curds were hot 'n fresh, but the smoked tomato based dipping sauce was curious. The better dipping sauce is the IPA gouda cheese that accompanies the pretzel bites. Feelin' spicy? Then go with the firecracker rolls. The happy hour prices are what they should be charging all day err day, but their service game needs work -- you should never have to flag a server down, especially one that doesn't even work the area you're sitting in! We'll likely give it another whirl just because, but there's better quality food elsewhere for the same prices.",

But wine was good. I picked strawberry margarita, and it tasted wonderful. I just started my first day of exploration of the pubs, and this did make my night beautiful.",

We didn't love everything but some items were great. Absolutely loved the Pork Chop! Delicious maple flavor. The real highlight was our server, Evin. He was very attentive and friendly! Also very knowledgeable and great with suggestions! Angelica at the bar was also great! Would come back for the great staff and atmosphere!",

    "text": "This was my second visit to City Works after a pretty unsatisfactory experience the first time (Fool me twice, shame on me, right?) Stopped in for a late lunch with my husband and kids on a weekday. Well after the lunch rush, so we were seated immediately.  First the positives: great atmosphere, stellar location. My husband ordered a burger and said it was fantastic -- cooked exactly the way he wanted it and very juicy. The fries were good and well seasoned. And our server was sweet, gracious and prompt. She asked if she should bring the kids' meals out as soon as they were ready, which scored her big points with me as the kids were definitely battling a case of the hangries.  Sadly, that's where the good times ended. I ordered the Thai chicken wrap. The veggies inside were crisp and fresh, but there was NO flavor to the chicken. No sauce, nothing to indicate that it was Thai in any way except possibly the presence of some bok choy, which does not Thai food make. My kids both ordered buttered noodles. I'm not exaggerating when I tell you that pasta smelled and tasted like it had been cooked in swamp water. Utterly disgusting. My six year old (for whom carbs=life) ate one bite, told me it tasted really bad and ate only French fries. I tried a bite to prove him wrong and immediately ordered both of my kids to not eat the pasta. Clearly there was no salt in the water, no butter or seasoning on the pasta, and I'm just not even sure what was going on in the kitchen or with the water. My regret is that we didn't just send the plates back, but I needed to get back to work timely and frankly have heard too many horror stories about what happens to people who send food back.  Second time was, sadly, my last time. I'm all for atmosphere and location, but it's wasted on a restaurant that just can't deliver decent food.",

We were able to get drinks and stand away from the bar. As big as the bar is it was 4 or 5 people deep. For as busy and new as it is the service was excellent. Food came promptly. The ribs are outstanding. Probably some of the best that I've had. Had to wait for drinks a couple of times but overall we were impressed with how well the place operated. Definitely worth trying.",

Like before there were empty tables but still a wait.  Not sure what their system is.  Lots of great tvs to watch a game and plenty to drink.  We ordered a ruby's red and a margarita...both were delicious and refreshing.  We also odered from the Shareable section...smoked wings with 2 fantastic dipping sauces and a BBQ chicken flatbread...so good!  It was a bit of a splurge as 2 drinks and 2 appetizers came to almost $50 but very good quality food and drink.",
