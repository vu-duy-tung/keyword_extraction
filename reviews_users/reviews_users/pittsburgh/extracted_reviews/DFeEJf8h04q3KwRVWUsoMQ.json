Pool (on Friday/Saturday) is $14 per hour (I'm pretty sure its $10 through the week)  Mixed drinks are way too pricey for the location. The food is crap.  The games are fun and the pool tables are nice (they're the big tournament style/size, not the shitty bar-room, tiny pool tables).  That is all.  :)  (the pricing is based on my recent trip. We shot pool for a few hours, I had a bar tab (that wasn't out of control) and my night ended up costing me $60",

The room was spacious, well-appointed with tables covered with black tablecloths and set up according to our specifications. The buffet was delicious. The manager, servers and bartender were enthusiastic and attentive. What a wonderful facility.  Kids and adults loved the arcade games. The pool tables were a hit too. We appreciated the roomy dance floor for those who wanted to groove.  In the months leading up to our event, special events representative Laura checked in regularly. She, Sean and the managers made sure that our experience was memorable and even added extra touches that made us feel special. Thank you, D&B, for a great experience.",

Staff was relatively unorganized (we ate at a table next to the bar), and had to wait awhile for a server. Food was prompt.",

Un-nerving actually.   Because Dave and Buster's is all about excess. Almost obscenely so.  As far as food - their stuff is standard. Most of it is fried and as another reviewer pointed out - not very healthy. At all actually. You have to really scour the menu to find some somewhat decent viable and nutritious options.  But most people don't come to Dave & Buster's for food. They come for the games.  And while I've never been that into video games or arcade games - my brother and sister always have.  I was apprehensive about having a good time here  - but after awhile - my siblings' enthusiasm about the place became contagious and I found myself really enjoying myself.  Especially once i realized that I have mad skills at Skee Ball. And proceeded to dominate.  Trust.",

The games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality. It takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil! The atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people! Now, it is run down and many of the games are app related games (Fruit Ninja) and 3D Experience rides. With such \"games\", you can't even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens! Last time I went, back in the winter, many of the games were broken, which made for a negative player experience. I would go to D&B to play some games again in the future, but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets.",

    "text": "GREAT PLACE FOR A BIRTHDAY PARTY!    A FAMILY GATHERING!    A WORK RETIREMENT PARTY!    OR EVEN A DOUBLE-DATE!  A combination watering hole, great place to eat and great entertainment for adults! Adult games!  The Homestead (Pittsburgh) location of Dave & Busters is just one of the almost 50 locations across the country - from New York to Florida to California - - from Canada to Mexico.    The Dave & Busters idea was conceived in Little Rock, Arkansas back in the 1970s. Two different businesses (one a popular watering hole & one a game & entertainment business) were right next door to each other. The two young owners were friends and quickly realized that combining their businesses made perfect sense. So they opened the first combined D & B in  . . . . no, not Little Rock, but Dallas! To this day there are no D & B's in Little Rock. Not sure what is up with that! But lots of other cities have been the beneficiaries of these two friends combining their businesses.  The one in Pittsburgh is the only one I have ever been to.  When I lived there, a group of friends and co-workers (and me, of course!)used to go there for Happy Hour & Power Hour . . . . at least once a week. We had a blast!  A great place to kick-back and let the worries of the work day melt away.  Wonder if they'll ever open one in Marin County, CA? Shucks!  Probably not. Not a Marin County scene, for sure.   WHAT A BLAST IT WAS THOUGH! I miss going to D & B. They have all the classics, like billiards & shuffleboard, plus over 200 interactive & video games. A rechargable Power Card provides an easy way to access all the games.    POWER HOUR is game HAPPY HOUR - - an entire hour of classic and video games for just  ten bucks.    A GREAT BAR, WONDERFUL FOOD AND SERVICE! A RELAXING AND FUN WAY to spend a Friday or Saturday evening. You'll never want to leave. Meet your friends here, grab a beer and a burger or steak and hit the games.   Time will just evaporate . . . . while you laugh and drink with your favorite girl, your best friend or even your boss!    DAVE & BUSTERS! LOTS OF PARKING! LOTS OF FUN!  FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! FUN! . . . . BRING ON THE BEER!",

I went on Facebook and printed off a coupon for buy $20 get $20 in play free (we split the card, it took us about 1.5-2 hours to get through)  The games weren't *quite* as fun as I remembered, but it was still a good time. The place was far from crowded, and when a machine was out of tickets, it took us a good deal of time to find someone to assist us. When we did, the team at D&B could not have been more accommodating. To apologize for our wait they swiped us in for several games as well as gave us a handful of tokens for the game we were playing.   I think a lot of companies (I'm looking at you, American Airlines) could learn a lot from D&B. It cost them virtually nothing to swipe us in for games, but it made our experience so much better.  Drinks are half-price after 8 or 9, my Tropical Mojito was awesome! My friend and I are definitely planning on going back on a Wednesday for half-price games AND half-price drinks.",

Contrary to some reviews mentioning young kids, the crowd while we were there (8pm-12 on a Wednesday) seemed to be just 21+.  We discovered an issue with the skee-ball games and alerted the gift shop attendant; he came over within 5 minutes and fixed the machines and gave each of us a free play.  I was impressed. D&B has a good mix of games-- FPS, trivia, wheel of fortune, sports, glorified iPad games, and arcade classics.  Sadly there is no \"whack a mole.\"  We looked.  I was surprised by the value, albeit on a Wednesday when games are half off.  Two of us shared a card loaded with $12 (supercharged $10) and it lasted us almost 4 hours, playing games constantly.  We won something like 2000 tickets in that time, although we were going for entertainment value rather than tickets.  Drinks--we were there for happy hour (starts at 9 pm), and cocktails were half off (about $3-$4 after discount).  We tried the mojitos, white sangria, and green apple martini.  The first two were really sweet (although my friends like them), but the martini was a nice balance of sweet and sour.  I will definitely be returning, although I will probably stick to later at night to avoid the kids mentioned by other reviewers.",

They called in a manager to verify my id and he was very rude to the rest of our group when they tried to hand him their ids. We then went into the restaurant to eat in a more quiet area. We waited over 20 minutes before the hostess came to our table and said \"I'm sorry I'm not a server I really don't know what I'm doing but can I please get you something to drink?\" Our food came out and the man who delivered it took two plates off of one side of the tray and the weight of the other half caused the tray to fall on the floor. His response was \"surprisingly that's only the fourth time that's happened to me.\" FOUR? Once is an accident and a lesson. He then had my salad \"remade\" which was supposed to be a Caesar kale chicken salad with tomatoes, Parmesan and cilantro. It came out with ice berg lettuce, literally four pieces of chicken that were cold, and maybe ten pieces of tomato. I asked for a manager who assured me that he would remake my salad (for the third time) himself. So while the rest of my group was already done with their meals I hadn't even began mine. Out of respect they all sat there with me while I finished when they could have been playing. I asked for free play or something since they were waiting for me and was laughed at. The waitress came at the end of our meal to verify how the check would be split then came back and said \"I didn't get your drinks so I don't know what check they go on\" when our checks arrived they were incorrect. They did however remove my salad from our bill. Altogether this place is extremely overpriced. My fiance and I spent $50 with $30 free play for less than 500 play tokens and ended with around 2,000 tickets which warranted 2 coffee mugs, an infuser cup and a travel coffee cup! He got Philly cheesesteak sliders with fries (all cold) and a coke and the bill was $20. Also, our bar tab for a bud light and a frose was $15. Bad service, rude people, overpriced, gross food... we won't be returning.",

We went right when they opened for the day, with the intention of playing some pool.  We located the pool tables in an area that looked closed off, so we went to the hostess stand to ask.  She radioed for help, got none, and finally went in search of an answer our question.  When she came back, she said she couldn't find anyone, but a manager would be out to talk to us.   We wait...and wait...and finally just give up and go off to play in the arcade area.     All but one of the card purchase machines were rebooting, and the one we could use didn't work.  It takes forever and finally gives up and directs us to a non-existent ticketing attendant.  So we again go off in search of someone to help.  We flagged down a server, who issued us a card ($56 for 375 tokens) and served us a few cocktails (average prices, though my rum and coke was teeny).     And we are off to play some games.  About every third game we tried was broken in some way.  Either the token swipe didn't work or the game itself was messed up.   It also wasn't the cleanest place I've ever seen.  They have tables around the place to set your drinks on, but most of them didn't look as though they'd been wiped from the day before (which of course makes we wonder when they last cleaned all the games that germy little kids touch all day).  Overall, they appeared completely unprepared for opening (computers booting, employees not ready to work, soda gun at the bar not assembled, etc.) and not well maintained or managed at all.  The broken games were sort of comical after a while, but definitely not in a good way.  If you are really looking to do this type of activity, I'd try a different location for sure.",

    "text": "We took a very large group (22) of adults, tweens, and teens when we were in Pittsburgh for the kids' sports event.  I didn't take an extraordinarily long time to get us seated even though they don't do reservations or call-ahead.  They asked that we let them know when 75% of our party was there and, after that, it was maybe 20 minutes.  We (the grown-ups) had one drink at the bar while we waited.  The bartender was friendly, efficient, accurate and then gone -- pretty much what you want at a place like that.  The drinks were the right mixer/liquor ratio.  At dinner, the server (Kristine, I think) was friendly and attentive.  She got zero orders wrong and the food also came out in what I think was a reasonable time for the size of our group.  (The only mistake was one person never got the steak knife they asked for and ended up having to use a butter knife on his steak.)  As a server in my high school/college life, I can definitely attest that it's hard to get zero things wrong, from the server to the kitchen, with that large a group.  I'd qualify the food as \"pretty good\" and definitely better than one might expect at the grown-up version of Chuck E. Cheese.  I had salmon and it was cooked nearly perfectly (a hard feat to pull off).  And the salmon came with sauteed spinach which I love!  The gaming area was TONS of fun, of course.  The tokens-per-game cost was about what I would expect (high-ish).  Using the card instead of paper tickets is definitely the way to go.  The prize selection was huge but, of course, is right in line with what you'd expect...a ton of tickets for anything decent.  (My daughter's 800-ticket - I think - water bottle was dropped on the carpet the next day and busted, soaking the carpet and disappointing her.)  We go into any D&B expecting to spend about $50/person and to have a great time.  That's what we got.",

It's a lot bigger and has more variety of games than the other 2 I've been to, though they pretty much have the same games. The prizes are also better here, and the ticket exchange rate for the prizes seemed a lot more fair too. Definitely take advantage of the half priced games on Wednesdays!!!  I don't come for the food, since it's very average. With all these good restaurants close by, why don't just eat somewhere else and come for the games?",

I enjoy the hoops game,  the top 40 music,  the yummy eats and most of their cocktail menu is pretty darn impressive. I always go for the Passion Fruit Sangria or the Backwoods lemonade that comes with a shot in a mini Solo Cup. They can be pricey after a while that's why I show up for happy hour.

I have tried eating here on several occasions and find that it is for the most part terrible. Nothing tastes like it is fresh at all. I would guess everything is delivered frozen and then either deep fried or heated in a microwave. I can't think of any meal I've ever finished here either from being bland or just plain lousy. Even my 11 year old, who loves wings and chicken fingers (2 staples here) thinks the food is terrible and refuses to eat here, even though he loves to play the games.   My advice, eat somewhere else then head here to play.",

    "text": "ehh, 3.5 -- I can't rate it super low because i do smile a lot during my visits. Speaking of that, I've been here a few times, but never wrote a review for D&B.   I'm a kid at heart and honestly do enjoy the games. However, there have been multiple instances where I swiped my game card & it took my credits, but no game began. There have also been times that I won and no tickets were released. I guess nothing is perfect but it does happen atleast once a visit (each scenerio)  It's hard to find a worker walking around and for half-price games, you kind of just take your loss with the 1.3 credits for skee ball (hmph!)  The food- it really isnt anything too fancy. I've had okay food, but super long wait times for a simple chicken fingers & fries for example. It's your basic sandwiches, salads, appetizers & a few pastas. I believe all sandwiches & burgers are around $10 & served with fries.  You can get the Eat & Play deal which includes food from a specific menu + a game card. Besides the game card deal, if you wanted to make D&B a date night you might be better off heading to another place to eat in Waterfront for amazing food.. but to each their own.  Try it once I suppose. The brownie sundae that i devoured last night was satisfying (2 brownies, 2 scoops of ice cream.. one with chocolate syrup; the other with raspberry sauce & fresh strawberries. Oh & whip cream)  Drinks- pretty weak. We ordered 2 liquid maryjanes (2 each that is) which are filled with multiple shots of alchy & didn't really catch a buzz. Oh welllll. They do have a happy hour from 5-7pm. I'd go during that time for the best deal. I believe cocktails are half off & $3 off  bottles of wine. I've never seen anyone walking around with a wine glass though lol.   The prizes- as others have noted, the prizes are a little cheap for the amount of tickets they \"cost\" However, it's cool to leave with a D&B coffee mug, cup or shot glass. Last night for 2500 tickets we decided on magnetic-style dart board (1,300?) a coffee mug, a D&B glass (our plastic one bit the dust) & a D&B coffee travel mug.. I might be missing a few odds & ends.  Overall it's a fun time but can be pricey. It's best to head here Wednesday for half price games or get the Eat & Play deal while dining.   I can't lie though, I find myself smiling ear to ear a few times within those 3 hours (woah, seemed longer than amount of time :D ) Speaking of which, in that time-frame we played 250 credits (cost= $40) but it was half-price games.",

The waitresses herself was rude, looked as if she had recently consumed drugs, and had to ask her co workers about our basic questions in regards to the menu. Complained to the manager about the poor service, and was told that if we do not like it, we can leave. Ridiculous. Never eat food or get drinks here. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else in the waterfront. Rock Bottom is right across the street. Drink/Eat there then buy a game card if you must come here. Place sucks",

Once you have money on your Power Card, you use this card to pay for games. As you win games, you get tickets that are uploaded to your Power Card and then you can cash out your tickets for prizes at the end. The prizes are typical arcade/carnival prizes, but the more tickets you win, the better the prize. I went with a group and we were able to pool our tickets together to get one of the nicer prizes. The bar was nice, but drinks were a little expensive, especially the signature cocktails. We didn't eat here, but everything smelled good. Keep in mind that this is a big place, so if you're with a big group, you'll probably get separated. Overall, it was a fun time!",

Fortunately, the geniuses behind Dave & Busters got my back. Sometimes I just need to escape the stress of adulthood with a few rounds of skee-ball (don't judge me). I can work with the amount and variety of games, but it could definitely be better. I would suggest coming in on Wednesdays for half-price games to get more bang for your buck!  Be aware of the obnoxious guests. I expect children to be a bit rowdy, but even some adults suddenly forget all socially acceptable behavior once you throw them in the arcade.   I come to D&B for the games and not the food. Aside from the horrible customer service I've experienced, their food also tastes generic and mediocre.  For the prices they're charging, it is not worth it. Save a few bucks and find a better meal elsewhere.",

Last time we were here, we were not pleased, but today, we had a much better experience.   They had a ton of new games, which is a bonus! All of them were working too.....double bonus! I think they are a bit expensive, but it was a treat to go, so we didn't mind spending a couple of extra bucks.  After playing out the credits on our card, we decided to have a late lunch. The menu is quite large, but has a great selection. Our server, Kiara, was wonderful! You could tell she was stressed out from her day, but she was very pleasant. We are pretty easy to take care of and you could almost hear the sigh of relief she gave when we told her to take her time and were ready to order when she was able to make it back from another table.  The restrooms were gross and the hostess stand was filled with confused girls who couldn't have cared less. The prize room was so empty of prizes, we decided to keep our points for our next visit.  We will be back, we will ask for Kiara to be our server, and hopefully we will be able to find prizes worth taking home!",

    "text": "This D&B is like any other but I am just not impressed with games that constantly cheat you out of tickets and nasty bathrooms.   CROWD AND WAIT TIME (5 stars!): For being in such a popular area, the crowd wasn't too bad on a holiday from noon-3ish. The most we had to wait to play ticket games was 1 person. Not bad at all.   STAFF (5 stars!): 5 stars for the wonderful staff! The bartender was friendly even though we just wanted waters the whole time, the techs were awesome and we saw them the most because the coin games were being jerks. The prize clerks were actually friendly rather than the \"I hate life\" clerks we have found at other locations.  COIN GAMES CHEATING YOU OUT OF TICKETS ( -1 million stars): So half of the coin games that were actually working get 0 stars because if you don't constantly continue feeding the 10 coins you pay for then it thinks nobody is there making it hard for the slower strategic players. When too much time passes between the play of a coin and the time coins fall then it won't give credit for the win/tickets. The techs told us that this is so D&B doesn't shell out tickets for gravity doing its job aka those awesome random coin falls. This makes D&B a real DB! Getting random tickets for ghost falls was always part of the fun of those machines. If a coin falls, someone, anyone deserves to get the tickets, especially when your screwing players out of their actually earned tickets. FIX YOUR MACHINES!  Players: 1. always ask for help when you notice you're not getting tickets for coin falls. 2. always make sure you get 10 coins per swipe. Every machine we went to had 2 or 3 get stuck. The techs will help you every time.  NASTY BATHROOMS (0 stars): 0 stars for the nastiest bathrooms in the Waterfront. This must be a D&B thing because every D&B bathroom I've entered smells like urine, toilets are nasty, exposed feminine products stare you in the face not 1 foot away from where you pee (I don't want to see a used anything thank you), and either there is not enough soap dispensers or they've run out of paper towels. Don't forget the overflowing trashcan. There's a lot of people going in and out, D&B needs to clean their bathrooms every hour or 2.",

While we're looking at the menu, a man shows up out of nowhere with a camera asking to take our picture for a keychain--it's free but he's \"working for tips\".

Last time I had to flag down the host to let the server know we were seated. Then we didn't get our drinks until our food came.

My husband is active duty military and was unable to take leave to visit Home for the 4th of July. My children and I went to this location with his parents and family to spend a day out together. There was a sign for a military discount which I inquired about (since my husband was not present I did not expect the discount) but it was graciously given to us. Our food order was greatly discounted by this policy, but what was amazing was the manager took my children's play cards and offered them selected free games (the ones that don't earn tickets). My children were thrilled by this and played for hours. They had been sad about their dad not coming with us and this helped immensely. We couldn't be more thankful that this location allowed us to use the discount. The location wasn't very busy which was also amazing because we were able to play for a decent amount of time before heading home. We were there from 11 AM until about 3 PM. Thank you for making our trip better than we could have expected!",

The selection of games available are always changing and there's always something new and awesome to play that wasn't there the last time you were. The problem lies within the machines and/or credit network itself. We lost a countless amount of credits Saturday on machines that would deduct from the card but fail to deliver the game play we paid for.  Try to play a 2 player game together: one player may receive their game credits and the other was left standing there like an idiot. Not good DNB, not good. Handfuls of employees walking by with no solutions. May be quite a while before we attempt to come back, can't see the point in \"buy 20 get 20\" deals when you take back the \"free\" 20 in credits. Is this a scheme ran by DNB, or simply a case of half the machines being inoperable?",

They immediately set up the table while about 4 of my friends and I waited; the hostess, after taking my name, never spoke to us again. She did not tell us when we could sit, how long it would be, or any other information. And then they made us wait for 75% of our party to show up before they would seat us. Mind you, there was no one else waiting, and the table was ready, and we were ready to order. But they didn't tell us this; I didn't even know why we were being forced to wait until I heard a supervisor whispering to the waitress about making us wait. I still have no idea why we were forced to wait.   When my full party was finally seated, we were helped by two waiters who were perfectly polite and nice. BUT, our service was rather haphazard. People would order drinks and food, and get things at wildly different times. One person was done eating appetizers and drinks when another was just getting their first drink. I know there was chaos to a big party, but it got a little out of hand.  The food is pretty standard American chain food, comparable to Appleby's and Chili's - not offensive, but nothing to knock your socks off. It has a decent selection, and a few good desserts and appetizers, and everything was competently prepared. Overall, it is a fine enough meal for a large group before going to enjoy the arcade at fairly reasonable prices, but some of the service standards are poor. In the future we will probably eat at one of the other restaurants in the area and then move over to D&B's for games.  Bar: 1 Star  Drinks are predictably expensive, but there is a wide variety. The problem is that about half of them don't even kind of resemble what is on the menu, and most don't have enough alcohol to even taste. Worse yet, while you can get a drink at the bar in the arcade, the staff is either completely non-interactive or just rude. You have to track them down, and then have a minimum of interaction before they stomp off like you ruined their life.  Arcade: 4 Stars  There are a lot of great games here to play, and many that are fun with groups or pairs. It is a great place for a large party, because you can mingle with all your friends playing many different very fun games. If you are a couple, there are also many great selections that everyone enjoys. The staff on the floor is helpful and fast to fix games that have problems, and are typically polite. The ticket prizes are cheap as expected, but kind of fun, and the people in the ticket shop were always nice and quick to help.  Overall: 3 Stars  If you want to hang out here, I would suggest eating somewhere else, and then playing games and having fun here, but only order beer at the bar and don't expect a smile.",

Compared to Playdium here, that's awesome considering I'd win at most 10 tickets with the smallest prize costing 100 tickets. The food is great, the place is clean and the games don't feel greasy or nasty from all the food.",

Needless to say, we didn't stay to eat and went elsewhere.",

    "text": "Chuckie Cheese for grown ups...Yeah, that could sum up my review for sure (but I'll try to make it a bit more interesting than that).  First let me say that this isn't my first trip to a Dave & Buster's.  Second, I actually experience all of it while here.  We will start with the food/service.  Staff, you were wonderful.  You were polite, you greeted us as soon as we walked in the door, gave us no qualms while ordering and were swift with your delivery.  Food, you were not wonderful.  I ordered the BBQ chicken breasts.  This came with a side of broccoli and their type of mashed potatoes.  The chicken was a bit dry and in some places you can tell it was left on the grill a little too long.  There were actually some bites that all I could taste was charred meat.  There wasn't enough BBQ sauce on the the chicken either.  The broccoli appeared to have been cooked prior and then thrown back into a pan to be seared.  Some of my broccoli actually had some burnt crisp areas on it.  Also I noticed that there were still some leaves left on the broccoli.  The mashed potatoes I wanted to like (which I hoped would be the best part of the dish, I'm a bit of a potato freak), but alas, I was let down. *sad face* They were cold and such a tiny portion.  With a tiny amount of shredded cheese and bacon but into that divot they made with the scoop to get it out of it's container.  Oh food, how if I didn't need you to survive, I wouldn't complain about you.  The building right now is in disarray.  They are in the midst of a remodel with lovely plastic curtains covering up certain sections of their dining area.  No bar out in the dining area right now and the pool tables were absent as well.  If you wanted a drink you had to go back into the game room.  Speaking of the game room, by far the best part.  With the meal I ordered I got the $20 play card (the best part of the meal, super charge it for $3 more and it's even better).  The game room  you can tell is in need of an update.  The carpet is worn and other signs of wear are noticeable as well.  One good thing is the games.  They change them up so often that there is always something new once you return.  Who knew that playing Connect 4 could be so fun, or for that matter Skee Ball rises to the top of my list to play.  I will return again, but only after I eat elsewhere first.",

We gave the server the benefit of the doubt because there were about 8 of us, which can be challenging.  I think the long wait time to get the drinks and then the food was due to the bartender and kitchen, but the waitress really tried her best.  I only gave it 2 stars because I liked my mac and cheese.  Everyone else at the table hated their food.  They all had sandwiches or other dishes.  The one girl resorted to eating only the toppings off her sandwich because the bread was too hard to bite through.  The kitchen probably made her sandwich right away and left it under the heating lamps for 40 minutes while preparing the rest of our table's food.  I was tempted to stop and play games for a couple minutes, but after my husband came out of the restroom he told me how about 5 other guys walked out of the restroom as well that had not washed their hands and immediately went over to start playing games.  All I have to say is no thanks.",

I wish there were no kids. After a few hours and a 3 course meal i decided to make my own fun.  I kicked a child off a racing game chair and they precided to cry like a little girl.  She was definitely old enough to understand why she was wrong. After a few choice words with management i will never go back there again and will only lock my kids inside of my car somewhere more adult like seabase.",

The Pittsburgh D&B location is recently remodeled, so if you haven't been there in a while, do yourself a favor and check it out.  They've expanded the dining areas and added new, modern furniture, there are more TVs than you can shake a stick at, a menu with something for everyone, and of course... games!  They also recently opened a new show in their theater room -- Pittsburgh magician Lee Terbosic will be performing 2 shows every Friday and Saturday night.  You can even order drinks and food off the menu while you take in the show!  I went to the opening show this past Friday night, and ordered a chicken quesadilla and a \"sno-cone\" (hint: this drink isn't one for the kiddos!) to wash it down with.  Both were great -- the sno-cone flavors were just like an ICEE I would get on a childhood shopping trip with mom and dad, but with that added kick of booze.  Hey, I'm not one to complain.  Speaking of added kicks, the quesadilla has jalapenos in it, which I loved!! I love spicy foods and most places just serve a little cup of jalapenos on the side.  These were actually cooked into the fillings and I loved every bite.  The show itself was highly entertaining and the crowd seemed to agree -- Lee kept everyone on their toes for the entire 60 minutes.  I can't wait to check out more shows here and flex my skee-ball arm!",

    "text": "We went here on a Saturday night prepared for the game room to be crowded and the dinner wait to be an hour or more.  The game room was pretty crowded, but not as crowded as I expected. However, there were a lot of games that were out of order. And one of the games ate our tokens. Also the card readers never worked the first time and we kept having to insert the card multiple times in different directions and at different speeds until it worked. It sure why that was happening, it could have just been my card because it is a few years old. Overall, it was acceptable, we had fun, but we did get annoyed a few times. The dinner portion was below our expectations, we had a coupon and I'm glad we did. The food was fine, but definitely overpriced. I'm glad we had a coupon because I would not have paid full price for what we got. The server told us the wait would be 30 minutes but we ended up waiting an hour. Whatever estimate they give you I'd say double it and that's what you will really wait. This is based on our experience but also the experience of larger parties that were also waiting. It seems like the reason why the wait is so long is because there is a delay in bussing and cleaning tables. The service is slow but our server was very nice.  Overall, I would come back here to use my other coupon, and maybe play a few games. But it is overcrowded and overpriced. If you can deal with that you will probably enjoy yourself.",

    "text": "This was my first and last trip to this establishment. If I could give this less than one star I would. First we were seated at our table and our waitress came over and took our drink orders, both alcoholic beverages and a round of water for the table. She brought the water and then we never saw her again. The water tasted worse than water Straight from a bathroom sink tap. It was nasty, high in Chlorine, almost tasted like pool water. 45 minutes passed and we didn't get our food, we didn't get our appetizers, we did not get our alcoholic beverages, we did not even get silverware! Finally, a different server brought out our food and appetizers together, all of which were ice cold. Even the chicken was cold on the inside! I called the server over informed her that our meal was called and asked to speak to a manager. The manager felt the food and immediately agreed that it was ice cold. We also informed him that we never received our alcoholic beverages, although at this point it had been almost an hour since we were originally seated. He took all of our food, and proceeded to bring us a new round of drinks. Unfortunately, on the rim of My glass of lemonade, was a massive dark pink Mark from someone else's lipstick! I do not wear lipstick, ever. I called the manager back over, and the poor man looked absolutely defeated. He apologized profusely and admitted that the whole operation was a mess. I honestly felt bad for him. Then, I saw a server come out with two meals on a tray. He got the tray stuck in the door, the french fries went flying off the tray, and a sandwich went into the air. The server grabbed the Philly cheese steak sandwich with his hands put it back on the tray, looked around to see if anyone saw, and then proceeded to serve the sandwich to probably a 10-year-old boy. It was absolutely disgusting. His fingers were all inside of this poor boy's sandwich, so I told the manager about that as well.  The entire restaurant at Dave and Buster's just has an overall feeling of being GRIMY. It's really disgusting, I felt like my food was not sanitary, the dishes weren't even clean, I was constantly worried that a server would spit or worse in my food because so many problems had happened. Everything felt really gross! I would never, under any circumstances, eat at this place again. I still feel gross, and had to take a shower when I got home just to make myself feel better. Stay away at all costs!",

The dish comes out with very few chips for 3 dips.  The guacamole had no flavor (no salt, lime, or cilantro flavor).  The smoked brisket queso dip was fantastic.  The bean dip was OK.  My wife ordered a bacon cheeseburger and it came out with no bacon, lettuce, tomato, or onion (just meat and cheese).  I also received my buffalo wings way after everyone's food came out at our table.  The wings were nothing to rave about.  They were good but the same quality you'd find at any large chain restaurant.  I won't be going back because I can get better food at other chain restaurants and not deal with the loud music.",

We basically sat there and watched her talk about us and the table as if we weren't 5 feet away. I asked the bartender if she took care of us we would tip her great . She said ok, I gave her her 35$ tip before we even got the check. We got unlimited wings , every batch was cold . I ordered a burger along with a salad and nachos , the salad and nachos came out after 40 minutes . No burger though . So it's now been 15 minutes prior to the bartender saying my burger was going to come out and my burger finally came out . I asked for mashed potatoes and she gave me Fries . Service was trash and the waitresses are rude ! I wouldn't recommend a homeless person to come here for a free meal . Very displeased !",

We asked if we could pay for the entrees now, play, then come back and eat in an hour.  We were told no.  It was suggested that we order food in the gaming area, let it set out for an hour, then eat it.  Really?  The restaurant had a total of 2 tables with people.  We left at had a great meal at Rock Bottom.  It's a shame D&B chose to miss out on $150 restaurant bill.  Will not be back!",

    "text": "Honestly not even a one star.   I came in from out of town celebrating a friends pregnancy and have never been to a Dave and busters. We walked in and were politely sat and our waitress took our drinks.   20 mins later roughly we finally got our drinks. Mind you we were not even given water or anything at that matter. We knew what appetizers we wanted and we knew our dinner choices also.   We all ordered the TNT drink, after we finished our drink we were told that we could only have one drink per hour!! Ou of confusion we were like etc what are you talking about this is also a bar and if we had limited drinks we should if definitely been told before hand.   We got our food, the service was absolutely the worst and like any customer we sat there discussing over dinner how long it took and how awful it was too be out of specific key items that would've made our dinner much more enjoyable ( for example: I got chips and Queso with guac, I was almost always out of the queso and guac or the chips and had to constantly ask for more which in all matter took about 15 minutes. There was no one else in the restaurant).  We had multiple conversations with the manager about how it was taking forever for our food to arrive and also with our drinks. After about 20 Minutes of absolutely no service the manager comes back and asks us to leave for \"cursing at the waitress\"... we never cursed at the waitress and we're always very polite even when we're absolutely dissatisfied with he service that was provided.   The point of the matter is the waitress must of been on the other side of the booth listening about everything we were saying.. then complained to the manager about our judgements about her service, said we were cursing at her and treated her poorly. We got kicked out and they put 6 extra drinks on our tab and asked us to leave, we never got those drinks and actually had to semi cause a scene to have them removed. We ended settling our bill and leaving but the feelings towards Dave and busters management and service/waitresses is absolutely a -20 haha I've never had this bad of service in my life.   *side note... we were basically kicked out for what we were talking about in a \"private booth\" which means our waitress was on the other side just hanging out eves dropping. Get a job/ life.",

Then,  to go to the arcade and spend more time finding workers to credit your card back for non functioning games is extremely frustrating.   It was so bad I eventually asked the manager just to refund my card because it had gotten so ridiculous.   Over 20 minutes waiting for a credit for a broken game.   Horrible experience.   Stay home eat take out and play PS4.  The manager John wonders around like he's herding cats because the chaos is overwhelming.",

    "text": "I've been a big fan of Dave and busters since first coming here years ago. It's located not far outside the city of Pittsburgh in the waterfront located in homested. They offer a lot of good deals and eat and play combos. It's always been a good spot to catch a sports game, pass some time, date spots, bring the kids whatever. It can get pricy but they normally have a lot of specials running and Wednesday is the best day here by far because all the games are half off. There open late on the weekends and midnight on other nights if I'm not mistaken. They even offer some eat and play combos where it's just a flat rate for a meal and a play card. Yes the prizes are overpriced for the amount you end up playing so that's a downside but if you come just to have fun it's a great thing. This location is always kept pretty clean and all the games seem to work as it's rare to see something not working here. I'll continue to come here In the future to enjoy time with friends and family!",

    "text": "We went to Dave & Buster's at the Waterfront for my daughter's 21st Birthday on 7/26/19. We have been to this location several times in the past & always had a great time, unfortunately last Friday that was not the case. We tried to make reservations because we were going to have a large party but were both told they do not take reservations for parties under 20. We arrived at about 8pm, I was concerned that we would have a long wait for a table on a Friday night, we ended up having to wait for a lot of things but a table was not one of them. The restaurant was half empty but full of dirty tables so they sat us in the sports section across the hall from the dining room. We were fine with the sports section, a table of 12 mostly younger 20-somethings out for a fun night. The tables they threw together for us were in poor condition though, wobbly & uneven & several of the bar stools had ripped seats (why leave them on the floor?) Our server seemed very nice. She took our drink orders & brought us water, she got our order for appetizers & very slowly the drinks started coming from the bar. Most of the table ordered fancier mixed drinks, one of the drinks was a TNT iced tea...comes with a special glass you get to keep. The TNT arrived in a plain glass which was disappointing, when I asked our server she apologized & said they were \"out\" of the souvenir glasses. Ok, except later that night the same person orders the same drink from the gameroom bar &...WOW, there's the glass. While our mixed drinks arrived slowly, the beer that my niece ordered didn't show up at all. The easiest drink, a bottle of Corona was still not on the table when we were half way thru the apps. I had to go looking for our server, she said that both bars were out of Corona & she had to send someone to get a case... from where Southside? How ridiculous .. say you forgot & go get it, don't lie. We place our food orders & there were A LOT of separate checks, I'll give her that but our food took a very long time & there was way too much time in between her bringing plates out. I don't know if they are so short staffed that they don't have anyone to help bring out orders together but my hunch is that she just didn't care about us at all. Sadly, everyone's about half way through their diner before I realize my niece, who waited forever for a bottle of beer STILL doesn't have her food. Once again I went in search of our server. When I told her that someone didn't get their diner she said... \"No, everyone's food went out\" as if I'm going to get that wrong somehow. So, NO... we're missing a burger... It was most definitely NOT Joss' night. No beer, no burger, NO BILL. Thankfully our server offered to take her whole bill off the check. I get that servers get busy and it's not an easy job but it was not busy, she was not busy.  The fact is she was not coming and checking on us, she only asked if we needed anything when she was bringing something to us & not even alway then. We had to stop her from dropping stuff off & walking away more than once to ask for silverware & drinks. Abi, the birthday girl, tried to ask for a coke when her diner arrived but our server was gone before she could even get the request out, someone else had to stop her before she walked away a second time just so Abi could order a coke.  This was a CELEBRATION, we thought we picked an appropriate atmosphere unfortunately the night ended up being a mess. We certainly didn't feel like Dave & Buster's staff cared if we were enjoying ourselves. It would have taken 10 minutes to buss a table with a half booth for our group, there was a dirty table behind us that would have been great & plenty big enough. But instead we got two different sized wobbly tables just shoved together with ripped up stools and a server who disappeared all night. The booth table behind us was STILL dirty when we left for the gameroom. * I have been reading the reviews other's have left and I'm apparently not the only person who had a bad experience with the customer service at this location.",

I think the prices of the games are comparable with other large arcade centers; a bit more than an arcade, but you can put $20 on a card and have some fun at like 10-15 games, which isn't bad at all.   The games are switched out quite often with the newest and greatest options. I like that I can have a new experience every time!  The Midway was clean and there weren't empty glasses or trash on the tables. I only saw one car racing game out of order, and it was one of four, so it wasn't that big of a deal.   We didn't visit the prize redemption so I'm not sure what the prizes were all about, though I saw other people with candy and some shot glasses. I'm sure it's a mix of child's and adult items.",

    "text": "Pretty bad introductory experience. I came here to enjoy the fights while I visited Pittsburgh but most of the employees seem to hate their job nobody greeted us or said hello or smiled for a while. I had to seek out to be seated and it wasn't even a busy night. The waitress that attended us brought the drinks and food after a long wait and then didn't even come back to ask how anything went. Very frustrating. Then at the end another waitress took over she was nice. The one star is for her pretty blonde lady that made some conversation concerning the fights and and refilled my drinks and cleared the plates. Management needs to pay attention to these things.",

Our waiter chose not to write down our order and then brought out the wrong food. The appetizer menu advertises \"jumbo wings\" but they were probably the smallest wings I've ever gotten in a restaurant.   This place has dozens of tv's, so we asked our waiter to change one of them to a hockey game; he said sure and then never changed it until we asked him again 30 minutes later.   I ordered the \"BBBurger\" which had burnt tough bacon and the burger patty was identical to one of those frozen pre-packaged patties you buy in the grocery store.   I'm not a complainer, but when you charge this much for crappy food/service I have an issue with that.   This place is a joke.",

    "text": "Oh Dave and busters how I love the! I'd give you a 5 if you didn't drain my wallet so much!   Basically, D&B is an adult Chuck E Cheese with higher priced games and better prizes!!! Unfortunatly it takes like thousands upon thousands of tickets to get even an D&B mug. You will have fun trying to get those silly tickets though!   One great thing about DB is they eliminate the insanity and bulkiness of chips and tokens. Everything is done right on the card (now they just need a way to do without tickets and I'll be set!)  The games rock ranging from everything you can think of. On my last trip they put a new trivia game in and it totally rocks. You can battle with like ten people and see who's really got the smarts!   Games are kind of expensive with each game running around 3.5-6 credits. It does make the money blow by quickly.   They usually have specials with tokens. Like right now you can have dinner and a $10 power card for $15.99 and that's really not bad at all. They have great food and great drinks!!!",

Unfortunately, I went for a bite to eat and it was impossible to find anything good and healthy on the menu.  I ended up settling for spinach dip.  Sadly, they topped the dip off with horrible orange shredded cheese that appeared to have been popped in the microwave for a few seconds.  Blahhhh.  Trying to get something healthy, I ordered the apple pecan salad.  I swear the dressing came right out of the grocery store bottle.  I could barely eat the salad.  Too sweet.  My mom ordered a steak roll.....holy friedness!  The steak was more like hamburger fried with cheese and then stuffed into breading that was fried AGAIN!  Yowzer!  Artery clogger for sure.    I like the atmosphere.  I like the bar area.  Perhaps next time we'll just stop by for drinks instead.",

Don't order the fish and chips unless you want to lube your insides for months. I know I probably got the one that got away and they refried it 3 times. The outside breading was hard as a rock and had no taste. The fish itself was bland. After a few bites I called over the waiter who was very nice and funny and complained by showing him how hard the fish was by tapping the fish against the plate making a loud thud noise. He grabbed my plate and took it to his manager. But before doing so asked if I wanted something else I said no I had lost my appetite. The manager came out looked around and walked right out of the area. I was thinking he would have stopped but didn't oh well. The waiter took my meal it off the bill. I have eaten there before and the food was good. Sometime you just get one that isn't.",

We arrived at DNB at 120 after several minutes of standing in an snappy restaurant, we were seated. We ordered beverages and the food. After 35 minutes my meal came and was cold. The sliders dry and the pasta cold. The three kids meals were hot but the fries Luke warm.  I sent my food back while everyone else at the table ate.   I pen this as I wait for my lunch and watched yet some one else send food back. Considering there are 14 people in the dining room that's a tad ridiculous   The waitress was apologetic and slightly embarrassed that the kitchen as she said \"is falling behind\"  I'm thinking DNB put their second string team  The manager brought part orb my food out with an apology 11 minutes later. My food was actually delicious but I couldn't finish because the kids wanted to get to the games. They were done eating.  I expect this on a busy Friday night not a dead Tuesday",

My son, girlfriend and myself went around 7p yesterday (Wednesday). We were seated right away and put our drinks in. The drinks came up pretty quickly and I was thinking this was going to be a very pleasant outing. However, that is where the service declined quickly.  The waitress (Autumn) came back with my girlfriends and my drink and asked if we wanted to put an appetizer order in, my sons drink wasn't ready yet. We said no we are ready to order though. She said ok I'll be right back. 10 min later she comes back to take our food order and bring my son his drink.   By the time the food had arrived our water glasses were empty and the person who brought our food was not our waitress so we waited for her to let her know our drinks were empty. Roughly 10 min go by and she comes out asking if everything is ok. I ask for a refill and she says sure then walks away. She comes back with one glass of water none for my girlfriend and walks away.  We do not see her until all of our food is gone. She comes and asks if we would like anything else. I said a check and two waters please.  She then stops and talks to two other employees (roughly 5 minutes) then goes on her way. She does eventually get the water and check to us.   The reason I gave 2 stars instead of 0 was the food tasted good and it was half price game night.",

    "text": "D&B is supposed to be a 'chuckie cheese' for adults. There's an area of the restaurant where you can sit and enjoy dinner and there's an area where you can play games.  This location offers half of games on Wednesday nights. Obviously, that would be a big appeal to kids/ families to come. Unexpectedly, when we arrived, there was a large line of kids waiting to buy passes. This is my first time here, so I was unfamiliar with the layout. Turns out, the host stand is NOT at the front! Important to know! We waited in line to buy game passes behind ~12-14 kids before finally being directed to where the host was so we could be sat.  The menu is standard American bar food. Averagely priced at around $11-20/plate. Drinks were fairly expensive ($10 a cocktail, for rather small cocktails). It is a large menu, but most of the food is some variant of \"fried\". They also offer an 'eat and play combo'. I opted to this, while my friends chose to buy their play cards separately. In hindsight, I should've done this since it was 1/2 off game night, but I didn't think about that at the time.. Ended up spending about $40 on just myself! $$$  Our experience in the food portion was subpar. Our waitress rushed us through the order, even though there weren't many other tables, and it wasn't even close to being closed. I ordered the buffalo boneless wings and added on a side of fries. To drink, I ordered the strawberry mango margarita.   These types of places provide fruity, super sugary, weak drinks. I knew what I was ordering. To note: If you want something strong, don't pick one of their cocktails. However, I love fruity drinks, and did not care about being able to taste the liquor, so I highly enjoyed my margarita. I love strawberry-mango drinks!  Food took a while to arrive. It was nice because my friends and I hadn't seen each other for a while, so we were able to chat, but I wish we had put in an appetizer or something to wait.  When the food arrived, they forgot to grab my side of fries. No big deal, but I eventually got them as everyone was finishing up with dinner. I asked for a box to take my leftovers home, but never got one, so that was a bummer..   In the actual game room, there's lots of options. A lot of these reviews said the games weren't working.. that was not my experience at all! I think I found one that was out of service, but with how many games there are in that room, that's not bad at all. Depending on what you play, you can get A LOT of tickets, which are auto-loaded to your card. That's super nice.. no need to keep track of paper! My $10 card went a long way, I ended up with ~700 tickets.  Their prize room is nicely stocked for a variety of ages. Kid toys, things for teens, shot glasses even! LOL! I chose an oil diffuser. I'm sure it cost $5 in store, but it was fun to be able to pick something out.   The problem is, over all there's a sense of dirty. Things don't look super clean, no one seems to have any motivation (worker wise), and everything was also super pricey for the quality that we got. I understand the game rules, but the food and drinks themselves were a lot of money.. Glad I've gone once, not sure I'd come back.",

We ordered an appetizer of avocado toast which took 45 min to get. When I tried to check with the bartender after 35 minutes of not receiving the food, his reasoning was 'the kitchen was very backed up' which seemed strange as the bar wasn't that full and the dining room was less than half full at that time too. Seemed strange that he wouldn't mention that the kitchen was extremely behind before we ordered or apologize after a long wait went by.The bartender didn't seem to be in not a great mood and we noticed it wasn't easy to get his attention to get refills either. Was kind of a turn off and we decided to skip getting any more drinks/food at that point and decided to go play games instead. On the positive side, I did try two different cocktails off the drink menu and they were both very delicious! The games are the main reason for the stars as the service pretty much left us with a bitter taste. We had some fun playing some of the traditional skee ball and basketball toss games and then decided to get drinks elsewhere when we finished.",

With that being said, we rarely eat here but when we have the service has been excellent and the food is delicious. We mainly come for the games at least once a month - in the winter, we probably come twice as much. D&B sends me coupons for spend $20 on game tokens and get $20 free so I use one of those every time and get $40+ of games for $20 which is priceless for my son's fun that he has there. He gets excited to see the new prizes and that he has enough tickets to get a plush every time. We really appreciate D&B, one of our favorite spots, and it is only a 15 min drive from us!

We finally accepted as we just wanted to continue enjoying our meal. 10 minutes later he comes back over with a free key chain with our photos in it and says something along the lines of people usually tip.... It's not a huge ordeal but it's irritating when you are already tipping your waiter and buying games now you want me to tip a photographer that I really didn't want at my table to begin with?... Not sure if this was because we ate in the dining area or what but it makes me want to skip on eating there and just go for the games.

    "text": "I really hate to write this review because I used to like this place in the past.  There were several things that promoted me to write this review.    Firstly, since it is the Holiday Season, I'll use the words from the Grinch song i've been hearing for past few weeks and I quote, Stink, Stank, Stunk.  Seriously, the bar area smelled like stanky and musty swamp water.  Someone needs to address this before we'll go back.  I think poor cleaning habits are likely to root cause.   Secondly, prices for drinks are 25-50% more expensive than neighboring bars.  I paid $10 for a very, very small pour of red wine (1/4 of the glass).    Lastly, the beer I bought came to price of $5.02.  Now who prices their product at .02 vs just simply adjusting price so that after taxes the price would be something a little more practical, say $5.00 even steven.  Da, that's pretty stupid and probably some cruel way to scam us out of the $98 cent tip on each and every drink.  Strange and certainly not customer friendly.    Bottom line is that this place creates a lot of friction in the experience, service and smells bad.    Might go back for the ridiculously over-priced games that the kids enjoy but never again to the bar for food or drink",

They have more games, a small bowling area, plus the Jurassic and Dragon VR ride which is so fun no lie.  I like that they have a full bar and you can order food.  Dave & Buster's also sends out good coupons they sent me free $10 and free play plus a coupon if you spend $20 on game play you get $20 free and you can power up by adding $3 and get 125 tokens for $23 instead of 100 tokens for $20.  So all together we had 250 tokens plus my $10 in free play for my birthday and there were three of us we all played on the same card and ended up leaving with around 80 tokens left on our card after about 2 and half hours.  You do have to pay an extra $5 per person for the VR ride but it's worth it.  I also got a drink called Caribbean Lit it had Patron along with some other things in it, but it just wasn't strong at all and it was $10.50 so the drinks are ok for the price.  We didn't eat here so I'm not sure about the food but it smelled good.",

If you want to be more relaxed they have old classic games like Pacman or new games like Mario Kart.

Let me get the bar part out of the way first, it's overpriced, and they try to get you to buy a glass to jack up your bill.   Next, the food. Just like all the chain places at the Waterfront, there are sandwiches, burgers (yes they have a blue cheese burger, who doesn't?) pasta, salads, chicken fingers, yadda yadda.   The games, I swear over three quarters of the games have been there since 2000 when the place opened. I guess in ten years no new games have hit the scene.  Overall Dave and buster's is unique to the Waterfront, but it's time to update the menu, update the games, and get into the second decade of the 21st century.",

My family and I were playing a trivia game---we lost about ten dollars of credits and all our bonus tickets when the power resumed.

You feel a bit milked afterwards. Also much fatter.  You pay for games using credits from mag-stripe cards. This lets D&B give their games arbitrary prices and makes it harder for you to really know how much you are spending. Menus for drinks and food have no prices. $6.05 for a Banana Split cocktail? $3.40 for a Michelob?  I have no idea whether that is expensive but not showing the prices is clever because they can price their things and not have to obey pricing psychology (like anchors and so forth).  Waitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts. Oh, and the dining room has plastic demos dessert trays to get that thought going in your mind as you walk to your table.  The games are all violent shooters or racing games don't appear to have changed much since 2002 when I last went to D&B in California. Hope they can find more innovative arcade games in the future.  Not a pleasant experience, but at least it's different from going to an ordinary restaurant.",

Everywhere you look, there are signs that say kids must be accompanied by an adult, but apparently no one was honoring that at 6PM on a Saturday. I couldn't even walk through the place without someone shoving me. AHHH! I get that Dave and Buster's is an arcade and that you're going there to play some games, maybe eat, and kill some time. When I last went there a few years ago, we there for my bachelor party, and while I'm sure we got into some shenanigans, I don't remember children running wild there. We were having adult beverages, playing games, and having a good time. This time, it was ridiculous. It isn't Chuck E. Cheese, yet that's how parents seem to be treating the place. On top of that, the customer service sucked. The place is gigantic, with tables and serving areas everywhere, yet on a Saturday at 6PM, the hostess told us (after interrupting us three times to chat with the other hostess) told us it would be a three hour wait, despite the fact that there were empty tables all over the dining room. I suspect this is a ploy to get you to play games and spend money until you're table is ready, but the food at Dave and Buster's is not worth a three hour wait on any day. The hostess told us we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table, so we attempted that. Most of those tables were empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table filled with coats who informed us that they needed the table because their kids would be back soon after playing games. Next, i engaged in the most rudest thing I've ever done- I began stalking tables where people were finishing up. I would walk up to people paying their check, ask if I could have their table when they were done, and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and I should get in line. Finally, we found a table and proceeded to spend two hours eating dinner. It wasn't because we ordered a lot of food- it was that the waiter took forever to bring our food out. He seemed to have no problem getting us fresh drinks, until we drank as much as we could and then asked for water. After that, he seemed to come around a lot less.  I had the build your own chicken tacos, which comes on a giant plate with all kinds of fixings. The fixings were fresh, but the chicken was cold and dry, and the tortillas were dried out as well. For $14, it wasn't worth it.  After dinner we proceeded to play games, which entails shoving people to get through areas and waiting in line to play anything.  All in all, I didn't like my experience at Dave and Busters. I remembered it being a fun place to go and unwind as an adult. but between all the kids and the crappy service, can't recommend this place. If anyone asks me to go back, I may elect to stay home and poke my eyes with a fork.",

At first there were 2 extremely slow workers trying to do this, then one left while the line was still out the door! The girl that was left was more than incompetent, and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards. We stood in line for over 20 minutes before being told that there was another attendant in the actual game room. Needless to say, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. It was a Saturday! After we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer. 2 bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full. It took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming. The floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! I had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms I used have no toilet paper in them, but there was TP all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly. My boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better, as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didn't work. All I have to say is get your crap together. We could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on Saturday compared to what it used to be, and I'm I have no doubt it's due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness. For how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends. It's a shame how quickly this place has gone down hill and we will NOT be returning anytime soon!",

    "text": "My husband and I (both in our late 20s) have been to D&B before for work parties and enjoyed ourselves in the arcade.  The food was never very good... but the entertainment is.  So when trying to figure out a good holiday gift for our 4 nieces & nephews under the age of 10 who live overseas (and thus, can't haul back big piles of presents), Dave & Busters was a go-to.  Definitely better than Chuck E Cheese.  We had recently gone from two incomes to one, so we were on a bit of a tight budget.  The last time we were there, $20 went really far for us- and our server also talked about getting $10 free coupons when signing up on-line.  So we opted to give each of the kids $15 power cards and used our free coupons.  The person they had at the register had to have an IQ of about 3.  Her name was Mariah or Sariah or something.  She had no clue what she was doing.  How can your total be SEVENTY dollars when you only wanted four $15 power cards?  15+15+15+15=60 in my world.  Then we also had the buy $10 get $10 free coupons for myself and my husband.  So we went in expecting to spend about $40.  We asked her for a breakdown of the charges, and she got really defensive when we questioned why our total was so much.  She then threatened to make us pay some sort of 'activation' charge for each of the cards.  What?  After arguing with her for 5-10 minutes with her not listening AT ALL to what we were saying- she simply kept telling us the same thing over and over... the kids started to run amok from the waiting, and seeing the line piling up behind us - we just paid it so we could move on.  We were hoping to speak with a manager about the over-charge before we left but the little ones were getting to be a bit fussy and we didn't want them to have to wait another 10 or 15 minutes while we sorted the whole thing out.  The reason some of them were fussy?  Because this genius cashier gave us two $15 cards and two $25 cards.  She added the extra $10 play on, instead of divvy-ing it up like we asked.  Try to explain to a 5 year old and 4 year old why their cards were uneven and why one of them got to play a lot more games.  Not fun.  I had hoped for a better experience.  Next time I guess we will just go back to Chuck E Cheeses, since at least we can see and control how many tokens everyone has.  Really, really disappointed at the poor service and communication from the people there.",

    "text": "Not being from the area, I traveled an hour to come here from Uniontown, PA. I was excited! I haven't been to this Dave and Buster's since I was younger and was ready to go back and play me some games! I went with my cousins, mind you, we hadn't ate all day and were very hungry. So, we decided to do the Eat & Play Combo, naturally. Here's where it gets bad. First of all, we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. Then, we wait...and wait...and finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress. Her name was Ashley. We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. Next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. She said she'd come back right away with our refills...yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. Mind you, our food still hasn't came yet. I see other people getting their food that had come in after us. I was frustrated. After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with \"Well, he's really busy right now. I doubt he'll be able to come out and talk to you\". Finally, 15 mins later...that's one hour, folks. We get our food. What do you think the next problem was? Yep, the food was cold. I was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed I was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. The manager never came to speak with me, and we didn't even receive our meals for free. The only compensation we got were $10 game cards. Woopty-doo. The only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless. So, in conclusion...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE WATERFRONT DAVE AND BUSTERS OF HOMESTEAD, PA. It was horrible, and I will not be returning for a very long time!",

I love playing ticket games so luckily there were a lot of games to chose from and not many video games (sorry video game lovers!) We only played $20 worth of games and surprisingly we were there for awhile. I love their new Wheel of Fortune game! On our first play, we ended up winning a little over 700 tickets! They also have Fruit Ninja as a game. It was fun with the big widescreen but unfortunately you don't win as many tickets as you would hope. I wish their ticket center would have individual ticket counters like the other D&B's I've been to, where you feed a counting machine your tickets. At this place, they just weigh your tickets and give you the final count. We didn't try the food here and instead went to P.F. Chang's to eat before coming here, but the Eat & Play deal looked fun. Too bad it was only restricted to certain times of the day. Overall I had a blast here and definitely would come back. Hopefully next time when there is a deal or promotion.",

It took so long to get our food out of the kitchen that we had to get a manager involved. Our server had warned us that the place was woefully understaffed.  Dinner took over 2 hours. We had mentioned that we were headed to their theater for a show.  Speaking of which,  we could not get waited on in the theater. We managed to arrive 15 minutes before show time. We were asked to find our own seats and couldn't find anyone to take a drink order.  You would think that a place that depends so heavily on pay as you go entertainment and alcohol sales would do a better job of it.",

When we checked back in with the hostess, she had an attitude and said \"I called you 4 minutes ago.\" We never received a text notification and they never called our name, as we were at the bar right beside the hostess stand for 50 minutes and then moved over at the hostess stand approximately 10 minutes before we spoke with her. Once we were seated, our waitress was very polite and the food was amazing. However, the floors were disgusting and covered with food and other debris, as was the bar top when we sat there. At one point, our waitress handed us a ketchup bottle that was covered in ranch dressing and mustard and didn't think twice about it! We had to ask another waitress to clean it up. Again, the food was great, but for the price we paid for a few drinks, an appetizer and two meals, I expected MUCH better service. We did enjoy the games and such, but it was too crowded as well. If we ever go back, we will avoid the dining room at all costs and eat back in the game room.",

On the surface, this is a pretty expensive place; however, they give a bunch of good deals depending on the time you go, whether or not you \"donate\" money to the Make-a-Wish Foundation, and if you're lucky when you take a spin on the wheel of prizes! But honestly, know what the deals are before you go to make sure to get the best price available.  In regards to the games, there's a plethora for your enjoyment. Although it is nice to play games that spit out tickets, the last couple of times I've gone I've gotten 2 hours of arcade games for a very cheap price (Mario Kart, anyone?!). Either way, it's a really fun place that you'll most certainly have a good time at.",

I really wanted to dig into my Yelp bag of tricks provided by local Yelpers and introduce my team to the \"Shock and Awe\" they deserved but ... the shear numbers would made it hard.  When I started thinking about how we would have a manageable lunch - The only idea I could come up with was the Golden Corral - I knew that was not going to work for me.  We decided to do something local and walking distance - D&B was it.  It is what you expect - quiet for lunch video games and a bar nearby but I had to forgo any festivities - it was a work lunch.   I was pleased they had a under 600 calorie menu.   I am trying to maintain a normal diet due to my stretchy pants being out of style and not wanting to look like a character out of Family Guy.  The waitress was very friendly and organized.    I ordered the Cabo style Chicken - Chicken Breast lightly seasoned and char-grilled, topped with pineapple pico de gallo and served with spicy rice and steamed fresh vegetables.  It was eh...   The chicken was cooked but the pineapple pico de gallo was bland.  The rice was bland.  The vegetables were cold.   I really blame it on the fact I was with 15 compatriots for lunch so I am giving it a fair rating.  Everything was edible.  My team went with deep fried foods and burgers.   They seemed pleased.  Service - very good Food - okay, not great.   My meal was $13 Ambiance - well it was clean but there were not really any people in D&B  There are so many other choices for lunch that are local and close.  I would definitely recommend another in Squirrel Hill - I suggest you use Yelp to find you a better one (then come back and play! ;-) )",

We went to the attendant who couldn't have cared less, and instead of just giving us the credits back, they would send a game tech over to try and fix the game. I feel bad for the poor kid because he had to try and fix no less than 3 of our games. The drinks were overpriced and watered down. Terrible experience",

After the waitress walked by 6 times without saying a word or refilling our drinks we got a manager who had her come by and apologize and give us a round but never said a word about our food. And told us her help never showed up. We waited another 30 mins for our food before we asked for the check for the 2 drinks we got. We left and nothing was even said about why we never got our food. No apologies nothing. While sitting there we noticed 2 other parties walked out as well. They didn't even get their drinks. I would recommend that if you go there never sit and eat. Drink play games fine. I will never order food there again.",

    "text": "Ok! Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great idea!  It was around midnight and the bar wasn't really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me.   I stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, \"Are you working?\" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.  In between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B.   I was just really turned off from that experience.   The good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. This place holds some really good memories for me.   It's a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards I held for it.",

Apparently the bartender had to go to wine and spirits to get more margarita mix! Then we waited another hour for the food. I ordered the mushroom & veggie burger with fries. They brought out my burger but not the fries. I was with a group of 12 and 3 of us did not receive our fries or sides until another 30 minutes later. We are cashing out and some people still have not received their whole meal! The service was awful, I will never EVER come to this place again. Don't waste your time and money!",

The bar selection was pretty decent and they have adult snow cones (score!) I definitely recommend the mango flavored one, you will not be disappointed! Now on to the games, i seriously had so much fun with all the different options that they had, just watch out because you don't win tickets for all of them. Some of prizes weren't really worth all of the tickets that they wanted for them but you really can't expect much from arcade prizes to begin with, overall it was a really fun experience and I'll definitely be going back soon!",

The food wasn't bad but our service was overwhelmed so we didn't really have a server, and there were a couple small errors with our order. The bathroom was a wreck, like always. The trash can is always full, floors filthy, and smells strongly of urine. Half of the games I played wouldn't read my card on the first try.  Bartenders were slow & didn't seem to care, except for the manager.   I'll be back for sure but this place needs some serious staff updating.",

We arrived at 11:00 pm on a Saturday night only to have the staff continually ignore us when we wanted a table. I understand that it is busy on a Saturday night, but we called ahead to make sure that it wasn't too late to get food. For a place that is open until 2 am...it is absurd to be shutting everything down at 11 pm and only cater to the people already seated. I brought it to the attention of the manager and she refused to do anything about it except refund the money we had already prepaid for the game room. Talk about frustrating!  Also, this happened on a different date, I thought I had pushed send for the review but it sat in limbo for a while. This happened April 23, 2016.",

We got there around noon and were seated at an open booth with 2 stools on the other side. Normally not a problem but the hostess then proceeds to seat everyone else right next to us. Mind you the place is practically empty. I asked her if she could either move us or the other people to give out kids more room from not bothering people but she said she can't because there's not enough servers. The steak was crappy. Onion rings were horrible. Drinks were super expensive. Arcade was nice but expensive. Would not recommend going here. Not going to go back.",

All the children and people that come and touch the button handles and balls and may be sick or haven't washed their hands after going to the bathroom. These are things that should be addressed. You should have someone going around disinfecting the games and also checking on them to make sure they are functioning properly.  We walked in last night to sit at the bar. Drinks were cold and fairly priced and food hit the spot, but we waited well over a half hour for it. The games are always fun but almost every time you go there is a game or two or TEN that aren't working. This time it was the rock em sock em robot game that they currently promote on tv. Yeah, can't play that here.   I enjoy going here because its fun, but I will always come here with hand sanitizer. I actually saw a man use the restroom not wash his hands and was then playing a driving game five minutes later.  Not enough staff either if you're game is not working or need assistance.",

The fries were cold and the sliders were subpar, almost like White Castles from the freezer section in most grocery stores. My buffalo wings were rather tough. As for the games, they were mostly the same, but included a lot of the newer 'app' style games like flappy bird. Skeeball and Free throw were still fun, along with the coin drop machines. But, wow, we went through $50 of games really fast. The gift section is full of fun tchotchkes and prizes if you pay enough to rack up the points! Nevertheless, it is still a great destination to celebrate any special occasion with family, friends or coworkers.",

Its always fun to play games, win tickets, and have fun with friends/family. We decided to eat here before we played. I keep seeing commercials for their new menu, so hey it couldn't be bad right? Wrong! Only thing that was really good was the Corona-rita - but that's hard to mess up.   First off, service was horrible. I didn't feel like any of the areas were that packed to make the service so slow, but apparently I was wrong. It took about 15 minutes, minimum, to get our first drinks. At least an hour for our food. I have boneless buffalo wings, which are hard to screw up, so mine weren't bad but they weren't the best. My boyfriend had their Philly Cheesesteak and he couldn't finish it. Was SO salty and just not good. For the price of everything, it was not worth it all. Better off going somewhere else in the Waterfront for food and then coming here to play. You'll save $$, time, and frustration!   I guess they are also remodeling their price area so for now there is a make-shift area to cash in your tickets. Everything was pretty picked over, which kinda sucked. Overall it was still fun, and I am sure I will be back to play some more games!",

We asked for nutrition information, and the answer we received was, \"no, we don't have that, and we cannot guarantee what's in the food.\" Is that even legal in this day and age? The server seemed overwhelmed with the many (3) tables he had, and sighed and shambled about any time we asked for anything (like, lemons and plates). Save yourself the trip and the tip--eat a Lean Cuisine. Those are terrible as well, but at least your expectation is low going in. And for the cost, the food should've been at least edible.",

Making the plans was great with the manager, Laura; and I figured it was going to be a great place to celebrate my first born's accomplishment. Our package included food and game cards for everyone; as well as a sectioned off corner of the place. At first, the man that greeted me was really nice; but when I went to give him complain about the food being cold- he completely changed. Mind you, everyone is traveling from out of town. Everyone is hungry and ready to eat. The fries were cold and nasty; chicken bites cold; pizza bites cold; Mac and cheese cold..and the soda pitchers all contained watered down soda. I asked him when was the food set out and he said it was set out 6-10 minutes before we arrived. Lies. So he replaced some of the items. When I went to pay, I told him I will not be paying the entire \"suggested tip\"; as I was not very happy with the service and his attitude and once again, he proceeded to give me an attitude telling me about all the discounts he had given me due to my complaint. Excuse me? There's no discount in the world that could fix the way he was talking to me and their nasty, cold food! So, the next day or so, I emailed Laura; who apologized to me and said she would get back to me within a day or two of talking to the host. Three weeks have past and Laura has not gotten back to me. Case closed. Never again.",

We hadn't even been served our food yet!!! Then to top it off,  they had a DJ that night, and the mic was entirely too loud!  The DJ talked non-stop and it was so loud, it was annoying.  It felt like he was right in your ear!!  The games area was good.  The best part about the games area was that you couldn't hear the DJ out there.   We left at 8:25 after spending about $150 on food, drinks, and games for 4 people, an annoying DJ, and some ridiculous policy that said we had to eat our food and get out within 2 hours!   When I went in, I had initially considered getting a dessert.  But I didn't want to be rushed and I didn't want to have to sit there and listen to some clown in my ear talking non-stop about raffles!  So they lost that sale.  Will not be back.
