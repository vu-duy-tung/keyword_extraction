    "text": "While I didn't go to CMU or Pitt, which share this beloved place as a go-to spot for good food and drink, I still frequent it when I'm in the city. The vibe is an old college town bar from the 70s or 80s. In fact, my mom, who went to Pitt, said it hasn't changed much over the years (and that's not a bad thing).  There are two reasons I go here:   1. 10 dollar bottles of wine. Yes, you heard me. 10 DOLLARS. They are actually decent wines, too! The Sea Glass Pinot Noir is my favorite.   2. Fast and fresh food with quality ingredients. I usually get the NY Strip steak salad and I've never once gotten sick from food allergy cross contamination. The meat is always seasoned well and tender.   You really can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches, salads or other bar fare. I admit I have not tried many entrees due to food allergies. The only reason they lost a star for me was because during my last visit, the waiter put a breadstick on top of my salad (I am allergic to it) and they had to make me a new one. Honest mistake, but I did warn him about my allergies prior to the meal. And anyway, it was more of an inconvenience for them than me! However, I didn't get sick, so life is good!",

    "text": "I've had a decade (or more) long love and hate relationship with the Union Grill.  The \"hate\" part was always directed towards their \"rules\".  Rules like, 'your entire party must be here before you're seated', and 'if you share food their is a dollar up charge' ...etc., etc.  While I haven't been affected by these rules lately, and I'm not even sure if they still exist, I'll stick to the \"love\" part of my relationship with Union Grill.  If you're in Oakland visiting the Carnegie Museums, or Pitt, CMU, or on business, this is a great place to have a long lunch.  If you're a local business person, the Union Grill is more of a place to go occasionally as a treat to yourself.  Unless you're accustomed to eating large lunches and dropping $15-$20 for lunch, than it's not somewhere you'd become a regular.  I tried something new off the menu today, roasted beet sliders.  Probably not a go to choice for most, but I am a beet fan, and I also like mini sized sandwiches, so score for me!  The beets were topped with feta, red onions, and spinach and were pretty darn good.  I also had a cup of delicious onion soup.  This, along with an iced tea, came to $16.  That is why I don't make this my, I-forgot-to-pack-my-lunch-and-need-to-eat-out destination.",

The Californian salad is my go-to; its topped with bacon, avocado, tomato, cheese, and I get it with blackened salmon- you can't even see the lettuce (ha ha) ! They do $10 bottles of wine also. The crab cake sandwiches are another one of my favorites. I would recommend doing the s'mores dessert as well.  LOVE THIS PLACE! A must if you are visiting the area.",

    "text": "I made my way to Union Grill for a turkey devonshire and pierogies. Two local foodie finds! This is a bar so it was very loud and it was a Friday night so it was also very busy.  I already knew what I wanted so I found a seat at the bar and ordered.  I didn't have to wait too terribly long for my food.  Longer than I'd like but there was a lot going on, especially because there was a free concert and homecoming or something a few blocks away. The food was great, especially for a bar.  The pierogi's were large, warm and well stuffed.  I wouldn't say the taste was anything out of the ordinary but they were hearty and delicious. This was my first turkey devonshire experience so I fell madly in love right then and there (I later found out that a Hot Brown in Louisville is the same thing, which I sampled at the Brown Hotel. The ingredients were top notch so it made the dish even better, but still, this was superb).    Turkey Devonshire is an open-face chicken or turkey sandwich invented in Pittsburgh in 1936 by Frank Blandi at his first restaurant, The Stratford. It's known as on of Pittsburghs greatest contributions to the culinary arts (named after nearby devonshire street) and was created in Oakland in 1934. The Union Grill's turkey devonshire is world famous, featured in numerous newspaper and magazine articles and on the travel channels Taste of America. The sandwich features oven-roasted turkey, bacon and sliced tomatoes on toast points topped with our famous cheese sauce. Yes, folks, it's a heart attack waiting to happen but if you've never had one or you just feel like indulging, this is it right here. Mmm mmm mmm.  Just a heads up for an out-of-towner, parking is difficult to find.  It's a very busy area near a university and the street is lined with cute stores and restaurants. Lucky for me my rental was a Fiat! :)  Don't miss out on a turkey devonshire folks!",

    "text": "If I could pick 3.5 stars, I would.  3 seems a bit low and 4 a bit high!  We've frequented Union Grill for over 10 years and have seen it go through ups and downs.  At times, it's been a solid 4, maybe even 4.25, but has generally gone down in quality.   Wait staff is attentive, very congenial and works hard to get things right.  Bartenders are efficient and friendly. All good for a \"neighborhood\" kind of place.  Beer selection is awesome with a passable wine selection.  If you want decent bar food:  Burgers, chicken tenders, etc - those get 4 to 4.5 stars.   Salads, aside from being over-sized in many instances, generally would get a solid 4 stars if Union hadn't cheapened up their salad dressings which are often over-sweetened with fake flavoring.  Fish is generally fresh and good - a solid 4 to 4.5, but sides can be lacking taking the meal down overall.  Veggies are often offered as sides and are fresh and prepared well.  But rather than add a nice butter sauce or just plain melted butter for the broccoli or cauliflower, etc - they throw a pound of veggies on your plate - I guess the thought is that quantity will suffice over quality.   Soups are OK.  French Onion is a bit bland, but is the best of the offerings.  Tuscan bean is passable.  Matza Ball is good.  But if you eat there regularly, these have been on the menu for a few years now.  They used to change up soups now and then with some pretty flavorful offerings.  It's OK to offer a few standards, but gets pretty boring to see the same 4 soups on the menu year after year after year...   Roast beef has been put on the menu again.  Not something we eat a lot of, but it's of decent quality, prepared well and is good in their \"au jus\" sandwich.  But who knows how long it will stay on the menu. Another example of the cheapening of the menu is morphing of what were great crab cakes into cheap knock-off pretty poor tasting fish cakes.  It seems Union often opts for cheapening ingredients or quality of offerings in lieu of evaluating size of portions and right-sizing while maintaining quality. In summary, not a bad place to dine.  The food isn't bad. But with all of the other options on the East End of Pittsburgh now, it's dropped down the list for us.",

All the burgers looked really good, but I thought I'd go with something a little lighter. Um, lighter was not happening though, as I later found out! My plate came with a HUGE helping of tuna in between two slightly too small white pieces of bread and a massive mound of waffle fries. The tuna was okay, if not a little bland. There was cheese on the sandwich, I think, but I couldn't taste it with the mound of tuna that they plopped in between. The waffle fries were just the amount of crispy, but was so much that I barely made a dent on my plate.  I my have had a little brewski during lunch. But it's the their fault! The beer list looked too good to pass up. I had to indulge! I also hear rumors of a $10 bottle of wine night. I'd be into that if I lived/worked around this part of town.  So the moral of the story is, foods good but drinks rule here!",

I've tried their burgers, fish tacos, Pittsburgh salad, and hummus plate (not all in one sitting...) and haven't been disappointed yet.   On my last visit here I got one of their yummy lunch salads to go. I didn't get home until well over an hour later, but the salad was still delish. The takeout container was packed to the brim with fixins and came with way more than enough dressing. One thing I really really like about this place is that you honestly get what you pay for. The prices are high, but you get portions huge enough to justify the price which makes it perfect for the region.   Minus one star for decor though...it's incredibly dark, drab, and outdated. Also, the layout of the tables isn't the best during peak meal times. Try and avoid Friday and Saturday nights if you're looking for a quick meal.",

    "text": "I've biked past Union Grill countless times as its $10 wine list sign blinks tauntingly but never stopped until recently.  Besides the $10 wine list (yes, Union Grill has about 8+ different bottles of wine to choose from all for $10), Union Grill is known for its burgers.   These half-pound burgers are made from dry-aged ribeye, sirloin, brisket and chuck, which are then ground into a burger. Burgers are accompanied by lettuce, tomato, onions, and a dill pickle and served with your choice of cole slaw, waffle fries, sweet potato chips, vegetable of the day, or rosted garlic mashed potatoes.  Even though the Five-hour Pot Roast was so very tempting, I went with the Blue UG. It came topped with imported English Stilton Blue Cheese and the accouterments. I choose waffle fries as my side and also the Homemade Steakburger Sauce.  While I waited I entertained myself with some of that $10 wine. Always a good choice in my book. The burger came out a smidge more done than I asked (medium) but the quality made up for that. The flavor of the beef was exceptional. You can tell no pink goo was used in crafting this behemoth. This thing was thick and juicy (the bun suffered a bit) and as a result I committed one of my cardinal sins: I cut the burger in half. Gasp. I quickly got over it. The blue cheese was mild and creamy as it melted and the steakburger sauce (tasted like a richer, and spicier A1 sauce) really pulled the whole thing together. The waffle fries were tasty but didn't seem like they were made on-site.  It was throughly enjoyable and hit my burger craving spot oh so right.  Union Grill's menu has classic American favorites like Turkey Devonshire and Tuna Melts, and the atmosphere is friendly, inviting, and reminds you a 1980's game room (in a good way). These reasons plus more are why it was jam-packed with diners at 9 p.m. and will continue to be so for a long time to come. I'll be back... for that pot roast. You can count on that.",

I added the lettuce, onions, and tomato and enjoyed it. The fish came out very warm while the sweet potato fries were on the verge of being cold.  The price was very fair considering the portion size. I would have been content with one serving of fish, but the fact that they served two will likely lead me back to the Union Grill for another chance despite how long it took us to be served our food.",

It's food is all fresh, flavorful, and extremely reasonably priced for massive portions.  Also, the wine prices are the cheapest I've seen and you can BYOB without paying a corkage fee.  Whether you want gourmet burgers, sandwiches, pasta or salads, this is your best bet in Oakland.",

I also enjoy their margaritas and the fact that there is no corkage fee if you BYOB. And as people have commented, yes, it can be busy, but if you're willing to eat at the bar or wait 15-20 minutes for a table, it's really not an issue. Overall, my husband and I love this place.",

Our food was perfect, and in fact I've been back there twice since the first time eating there and it was great every time.  Definitely a place I can take visitors and be comfortable knowing they will have great food at a fantastic price!  Now, it's a little crowded depending on the time you choose to feast.  However, I have not been disappointed here yet.  The service has been ok.  Some servers are better than others, but none have been rude, or slow to date.  Overall I am very happy that I decided to try this little grille on a whim.    Highly recommend this little gem to anyone looking for a pretty inexpensive meal that will surely please the palate.",

I recommend the Union Fish sandwich, although the claim on the menu that no one has ever finished it is laughable (I finished the sandwich easily and part of my friend's 'taters). The pierogies are also wonderful, but you may want to be specific about the cooking intensity as they tend to darken the onions a bit much for my taste.  The atmosphere is very nice - the space is darkly lit with large wooden tables and exposed brick. The layout also presents a nice variety of seating that I really like.. from the open, see-and-be-seen tables up front to the semi-hidden back area with a more intimate and dimly lit atmosphere. When the weather is nice, they open the windows and set up outdoor tables, which is really nice for people-watching on Craig St.  Speed is on par with the typical restaurant, and the staff are usually quite affable and very genuine in manner. Prices are reasonable, but watch out - the burger prices were recently raised by $2, which isn't yet reflected on the menu. The $10 wine list is great also.  Overall it's probably the best place for lunch, dinner, or happy hour on Craig St, and I recommend it! :)",

My friends suggested we come here, but the restaurant was packed on our first attempt. However, at 6:00 on a Monday night, the place was mostly deserted.  I ordered a crab cake sandwich ($12.99). The crab cake was OK, not the best and not the worst. However, they forgot the lemon sauce that was supposed to be included. This could have been an easy fix, but the waitress did not come back to check on the food.  Otherwise, the waffle fries were fine.  The meals are served on trays, which seemed a little low class for the price.  As already mentioned, the service was lackluster. The waitress we had was also negligent in that she did not offer to split the bill. Again, we made do.  Additionally, I found that the language of the menu was off putting. Both the $10 wine list and dessert menu come with the requirement of ordering an entree.  I don't mind this for the discounted wine, but it just felt a bit over the top for dessert.  I wouldn't suggest Union Grill to anyone, but I wouldn't be opposed to returning either.",

We ordered pierogies, French onion soup, and a special burger that was caprese. The pierogies were wonderful, very traditional homemade ones with delicious and bad three in the order. The soup was delicious as everyone has written. It does have a lot of onions and bread in it, so if that's not your taste I would not. The burger was good, but so big it was a little messy to eat. The fries were also great. Overall I would recommend it as a nicer bar type restaurant.",

The waffle fries were amazing and the choose-your-own toppings option is something I would love to see on every menu. The atmosphere has nice ambiance and they seemed to have a great selection of drinks.  However, our server Christine was extremely rude and only visited our table 4 times including when she dropped off our food and check. She was very short with us and never offered drink refills or asked us how our meals are. We wanted to order dessert but after waiting approximately half an hour to flag her down, she immediately jumped to \"separate checks?\"; I assume she said this because we were young. We never ordered dessert.  Another thing to note: this restaurant was very small and the tables were very close to one another. During our meal, another table was being seated next to ours. The hostess asked us to move our OWN table as if we had put it their ourselves.  This restaurant has a lot of potential but some of their staff could be given a lesson on restaurant etiquette. I would also suggest rearranging their tables.",

Don't be afraid to ask for medium or even medium rare. And ask for the side of waffle fries. A little bland but it's one of those places you go for the drink specials and the experience. Also got pumpkin pie which is cheap and you can get a la mode. Altogether stop by this place for a bite and catch up with friends. The place has sentimental value for me now.",

I wouldn't go here for an anniversary dinner. But for what it is and its price range you can't beat it. Everything on the menu is good to outstanding. I know because I've had everything on the menu through the years. It does change slightly over time, which is nice to keep it fresh, but once in awhile you lose an old favorite. The turkey burger (far and away the best one in town) was recently removed for example.  I can't recommend this place enough. Two people can have a full dinner with an appetizer and a bottle of wine (10 dollar wine list is awesome) and get out of there for under 50 (before tip). Go-to menu items include all the salads, burgers, and fish tacos. The tuna sandwich is also one of the best in town. I'm not as big a fan of the famous turkey devonshire, but for what it is, it's good.  My only real gripe is the recent interior paint job. It's a light green now. It looks similar to the primer we used to use on the ship in the Navy. Very institutional looking.   Get there!",

The wait staff and hostesses did ZERO to move parties along who had finished eating over 30 minutes prior. So people just hung out and we waited and waited and waited with an 82 year old guest.  We finally took it upon ourselves to ask patrons if they minded giving up their table since we had been waiting forever. Finally talked to the shift manager and she was unhappy we had talked to other customers. We explained that we would not have if they would have done a better job.

Set in the middle of Craig St. close to both Pitt and Carnegie-Mellon, the Union Grill offers solid comforts and some reasonably priced spirits to \"wash it down.\"  It's a cozy, pub-style restaurant that serves simple fare including soups, salads, and a bevy of mouth-watering sandwiches (and burgers) served swiftly and well portioned.    This is the type of place you can come for any reason, with any group - including kids.  Friendly service seems to also be a staple here...so if you're in the area, pop in for a pint...or maybe a fish sandwich...you won't be disappointed.",

Everyone who I've gone with have always gotten the chophouse burgers and we've never been disappointed! They are huge juicy burgers and you can choose up to 3 toppings (additional are extra); but honestly if you get more than that you might not be able to fit the burger in your mouth. I've always gotten the waffle fries as my side but they're delicious as well as plentiful!

With their sandwiches they have a variety of sides which is nice. The mashed potatoes are my favorite but today I had a little side salad. Not to shabby.   They usually have a nice beer selection which rotates, and in addition to beer there is a full bar and a cheap wine menu. Their soups and desserts are great. They dessert menu rotates so everything feels fresh and seasonal. This is a great place to meet someone for a business lunch if you are in Oakland, or if you are in college, this is a nice place to take your parents.",

The Kobe mini-burgers are my staple food there along with the shoestring fries.   If I go with friends, we usually end up getting a bottle of wine from their $10 wine list.   The service is generally good and the ambience is really pleasant. I usually see a lot of older Pittsburghers there. They have TV's there which is usually tuned to any game that is airing.   It looks a lot more expensive from the outside than it actually is.   Would definitely recommend it to anyone.",

It's traditional American fare and by no means will the menu blow you away with creativity or culinary ingenuity, but it does serve satisfying hearty meals at a reasonable price. I've went here with friends, I've went here with dates, I've been here by myself, so it's the kind of casual place that suits whatever you might be looking for.   The menu changes occasionally depending on the time of the year, but I usually stick to the basics like the Reuben or the fish tacos. I've had the \"famous\" Turkey Devonshire which is good, but very heavy which makes it sort of overwhelming.   If you don't feel like waiting for a table or are by yourself take a seat at the bar and order your food there. It's a nice little restaurant bar with a nice beer and liquor selection which also has some nice happy hour specials.",

I should have just eaten half of what was on my plate but I ate it all. I liked how the dressing was on the side but the bread was deliciously coated and toasted in butter. Mahi Mahi was cooked well, not greasy which was what I was expecting but didn't have much flavor without the dressing. Sweet potato chips were tasty with some ketchup.  Two other people ordered  burgers and enjoyed but again the portions were large. Another person ordered the Union fish sandwich which I almost ordered but didn't , which I was glad for. Perhaps it did taste good but when it came out it was basically two large, very large, pieces of deep fried fish that were ballooned up put into one sandwich. Wish I had taken a picture of how funny looking it was. No complaints nor anything to rave about. Would eat here again if someone wanted to meet there but wouldn't come back here on my own.",

The restaurant had a policy about not seating before the entire party gets there. I know some people didn't like that but it seemed reasonable since there wasn't a large waiting area. Because the restaurant was usually crowded, it also felt cramped sometimes, like I had to squeeze between chairs to get to my table. However, it's a great place to go try American food with a twist.  The hummus and pierogies are both great appetizers. The burgers and melts are fabulous. The food all comes in large portions and are tasty and hearty. The drinks are great and reasonably priced, especially during happy hour! I wasn't a huge fan of their lemon drop or mojito, but that's a personal preference.",

It's a nice place to sit down for a meal or watch a game.  There are several drawbacks: (1) They won't seat you until your entire party is present, which makes it not the best for a casual group outing to a bar if people will be coming and going.  I find this rule more suited to a nice restaurant than a bar. (2) I have never gotten them to cook a burger \"medium rare\" so I've stopped trying.  They overcook it every time.  Why this place appears on a few \"best burger lists\" is beyond me if they can't even get \"medium rare\" right. (3) Nothing's amazing.  There's no real specialties.  I can't think of anything here I can't get better somewhere else.  (Though the variety makes up for that if you're with a group.) (4) They close at 10 or 11 every night, even on weekends.  This is a little odd for a bar.  So if you and your buddies came here to watch an evening game, better hope it doesn't go into overtime or extra innings.  All that said, I still like it as a convenient place for two indecisive people to grab lunch or dinner.",

Situated on one of the quieter streets of Oakland, the interior is all wood-paneled and gives off a very warm and comfortable vibe.   I've been here twice for dinner and once for lunch, and I have to say that I was very impressed with the dinner. The first time I had their roast beef, which was excellent. The gravy was especially tasty. The second time I had a strip steak with a baked potato and a Caesar salad; the steak was big a juicy and cooked to a very good medium-rare. The salad a potato were also delicious. For dinner I really like the Union Grill because of it's atmosphere. It feels like a real restaurant/pub, not some hipster lair like so many other Oakland restaurants. There were no drunk college kids, mostly professionals it seemed. Both times I had had a very relaxing dinner. I forget on which nights, but they do offer $10 bottles of wine; you can't beat that!  One small drawback; this place seems pretty popular, so when I went there for lunch I ended up being there a little longer than planned. This isn't the kind of place where you can order a burger, eat it, and be gone in 20 minutes. The food was still excellent; we had the jumbo wings (really good buffalo sauce), Caesar salads, and a few bowls of a delicious wedding soup.   In short, the Union Grill is a good bet for lunch and dinner in Oakland. Don't come if you're on a schedule, though. Sit back, relax, and enjoy your meal.",

Burger was very good, but not the best I'd had, or as good as they'd advertised. But the portion was huge and the burger and waffle fries were both very flavorful. I loved the french dip, which also was a giant portion, and both the roast and au jus were extremely tasty and satisfying.  Service was a bit slow, but the place was full of people. Would certainly come back if I was in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "I'll admit, despite all the times I've been here, my knowledge of the menu is somewhat limited. So I'll stick to what I know and give you my impressions.  The pluses:    - The $10 wine list is fantastic. While there's not a ton on it, it's awesome to be able to get a good bottle of wine for a tenner.   - There are several appetizers that I would recommend; I've never had a bad experience with any of them. Personal favorite would be the hummus platter, but the wings are good, as are pierogies. And for the Lord's sake, get yourself some waffle fries with whatever you're eating.  - The burgers are among the best in town (IMHO). There are others I prefer, but these guys know how nail the difference between rare and medium rare, and the flavors are terrific. Also, if you're carb-conscious, you can get what they call a \"Steakburger dinner,\" where you get the burger and fixings without a bun, plus a salad and vegetables. Pretty durn good.  - The salads are also delicious, though monstrously large. If you're eating salad to cut back on calories, probably don't bother here. But if you eat salad LIKE A BOSS, then go for this.  The minuses:   - It gets awfully crowded and can be difficult to get a seat at times. (Though, service never seems to suffer from this.)  - It's on Craig Street, which means you might have to knife-fight some Carnegie Mellon students for a parking spot.  - Not a huge fan of the decor. I don't mind dim, but this seems a little underlit. (In the restaurant; the bar is actually fine.)",

    "text": "My childhood friend Dan and his lovely wife Jessica brought me to Union Grill Sunday prior to the Devin Townsend concert at Altar Bar...to test me.  \"They have a killer burger,\" Dan told me, eager to see me vanquish yet another gargantua of ground chuck. \"I want to know what you think of it, if it stacks up against Tessaro's.\"  It would be a titanic struggle, but the Godburger is still the Godburger, UG's burger falling just a notch short of Tessaro's legendary grill creation.  That still doesn't mean the UG's Steakburger is unworthy. In fact, if Tessaro's is the Godburger (look up my review), UG's is the Demigod burger; what Hercules is to Zeus.   I ordered mine with lettuce, tomato, onions, avocado, bacon, mayonnaise, a pickle lance, and aged mozzarella, one of a number of specified cheeses designed to compliment the meat, which it did divinely.   The Steakburger, cooked medium as always, was high, wide, chunky, wet with juice, did in fact taste like a minced sirloin served in a hearty bun with fixings, and seemingly took forever to defeat. Its sheer girth nearly dislocated my jaw when I attempted the first chomp. Dan's burger made him tap out halfway through the fight.   I have to knock off one star for the shoestring potato sticks since I felt they were best suited as a complimentary bar snack, not as a side dish for a meal. Dan let me try his excellent waffle fries, and I smacked myself upside the head for not choosing them.  The three of us savaged the Brownie Sundae like a pack of rabid hellhounds, plunging our spoons through the layers of hot fudge, piped-on whipped cream (homemade?), vanilla ice cream (also homemade?), and the dark, bloody luxury of the iced brownie in the quest to achieve the perfect bite of pure confection.   As I poured the hot fudge (served on the side in a cup) o'er top the accursed dessert, Dan said to me, \"Man, you really know how enjoy food.\"  And that's what UG is all about; enjoying food, traditional food, quality food that is executed well without haughtiness.  P.S. The service was rather good.",

I ordered the salmon dinner with baked sweet potato and vegetable. The salmon was perfectly cooked and was pretty tasty. One half of the sweet potato was undercooked and while I thought about having it cooked more I just let it go. The cinnamon brown sugar flavored butter was divine. I suppose the reason for the 3 stars was because I felt the price was a little bit high for the fare. Don't get me wrong though 3 stars is still a good rating. I just feel that the food, although good, was not as good as I've had in other establishments in the same price range. I also felt that the meal sat in my stomach afterwards and I didn't even go out that night as I had originally planned. Again, not a horrible experience or anything, but wasn't overwhelmingly satisfying either.  The establishment itself is nice but seemed to have a stuffy older crowd feel to it. Thus it really wasn't my kind of place as I either prefer a place either that is more ethnic or has a younger livelier crowd. I probably won't be returning not because the food and experience were bad, but just bland, and there seemed to be nothing else there that would really entice me to return. Again, not a bad experience though and I would recommend going at least once to see if you may like it.",

Union Grill fits the bill pretty well, and has a cozy atmosphere to boot.  The hummus plate is a pretty good appetizer to share.  While the hummus isn't out-of-this-world good, it's decent.  Bonus points for warm pita triangles and the feta, olives, tomato and red onion also on the plate.  The pan-fried pierogies, served with plenty of sour cream and caramelized onion, isn't too shabby either.  (Though the appetizer is a bit on the small side--just 3 pierogies).  Waffle fries also make for good sharing.  The chocolate silk pie is a solid choice as a dessert.  I ordered the spiked apple cider drink special, and was surprised when it was a cold drink as opposed to a warm one.  It was delicious, however, and a good balance of apple cider and alcohol.  Waters and fountain sodas come in huge glasses here, and the beer selection looked decent.  Overall, this isn't a bad choice if you're in Oakland and not in the mood for a noisy bar.",

I had the Local Burger which is topped with tomato chili jam, cheese, lettuce, and onion. I requested the burger to be cooked medium and it was a bit over cooked. This, however, in no way affected the juiciness or taste of the burger. Is it better than Tessaro's? No, but it certainly was good.  My only beef about this restaurant is how in their menu they continually tell you how cheap everything is, and how good of a deal you are getting. (i.e. \"Most places would charge $26 for a burger like this) I personally didn't think that a burger and a Budweiser for $16 plus tip is that jaw dropping of a great deal. Yes, the food is good and the service was friendly and I will definitely come back, but let me be the judge of how great of a value something is. I don't need to be forced into believing it.",

We ordered the cheese and potato pirogies, very disappointing for you only get 3 medium sized pirogies for $6.99 that way expensive  I can buy better at the grocery store for cheaper. Next the main course it was a barbecue sandwich that just seemed to come from restaurant depot rather than them smoking the meat themselves and making their own barbecue sauce. My wife had the grilled chicken sandwich also seemed cooked and flash frozen then reheated, but what seemed very irritating to both of us that the waiter kept referring to my wife and I as \"guys\" everything he said was the overly use of the word \"guys\". Hello people there is a lady present show a little respect. Probably would not go back unless someone was buying.",

With a little bit of everything it has some great specials and you can modify almost any item to your liking.    Union Grill was packed and embodied a \"where everybody knows your name\" vibe.  Other places we thought about going were on the empty side.  We ended up snagging bar seats, the usual MO for us anyway.  The wait staff was so attentive.  They all shared the bar tending responsibilities, so there was never a moment when no one was checking in on us.  You can tell this place runs like a well oiled machine.  The clientele ranged from college students to men in suits.  Decor lends itself to this range of customers as its very homey/irish bar feeling.  Great place to grab a bite on your lunch break or sit down and chill for a couple hours with your favourite cronies...a la \"How I Met Your Mother\".  Prices were certainly reasonable and they had an expected range of beer on tap as well as a full bar.  The ciabatta chicken sandwich and the  burger, whichever version or toppings you get on either, are fantastic.   I wish I had a place like this in my college town back in the day.",

My favorite thing though is the $5 S'mores dessert. For only $5, you cannot beat it. It comes with 2 chocolate bars, 8 graham crackers, a ton of marshmallows, and a little crackling fire to make your own s'mores. Sharable and fun for everyone.

The menu is american with salads, burgers, homemade chicken tenders, etc. So basically perfect for what I was looking for.   I had my eye on the salmon and they had a salmon filet and salmon sandwich. The former is tasty filet of salmon on a bun and I chose the homemade guacamole spread (vs corn salsa, pico de gallo, etc).  The sandwich was salmon combined with other ingredients. Price difference between the two salmon sandwiches was $3 (more for the filet). You also get a side with both and we chose the green beans.  Service was great. Vibe was relaxed but upbeat. Food was fresh and delicious.   This was the 2nd time I was here, where the first time I was very happy with their burger.",

While looking at the menu posted at the door a gentleman leaving suggested we try the pierogi. We had the pierogi appetizer which was delicious! It was three potato pierogi topped with melted cheddar and green onion with sour cream on the side. We also each had a bowl of soup which we both enjoyed. His soda and my ice tea were endless but I never got around to asking for a refill because the glass the drink was served in was huge!! Think 32 oz or larger. At the end of the meal I decided to try the $2 brownie sundae which was the perfect size dessert. The moist brownie, small scoop of ice cream and rich hot fudge was just enough without putting us in a sugar coma. If you are in the area, definitely give this place a try.",

It was an excellent lunch. The girls each got the chicken tenders with fries. Like the adult menu items, the portions are huge and we should have ordered just one. We each had crab cake sandwiches, which were very good. The restaurant was full even though school is out at Pitt and CMU. It's tightly packed and loud, but service was prompt and professional. I highly recommend it for lunch. It looks like it would be a good place for drinks, with good beer and wine choices and low prices. I guess that makes sense since the restaurant is squeezed between two large college campuses. We deserved a glass of wine but abstained because we had to drive home with the girls. Next time!",

I got the California salad with chicken and did not expect it to be so large. I was pleased since it was a little pricy for lunch, but I definitely came nowhere close to finishing. There was so much avocado on my salad, and the honey mustard dressing went really well with everything. It's not just the salads that are large. I watched another customer at the bar really look at and strategize about how to deal with eating a massive burger. All of the portions are really large.  I didn't get a drink when I was there, but it looked like they have some good drink specials and $10 bottles of wine.

    "text": "Union Grill turned out to be, by far, one of the worst meals I've had in Pittsburgh so far.  Strangely, this place is frequented by many people, which I assume is attributed to its location along Craig St, next to CMU.  A large number of middle-aged diners also frequent the place.  From what I've heard from a friend who had been in Pittsburgh longer than I have, Union Grill has seen better days.  Their food used to be cheaper and more delicious.  I assume that the middle-aged clientele results from brand loyalty, and the college students obviously from its location and lack of other \"gourmet\" burger joints within walking distance from CMU.  My group ended up here via the suggestion of another college student who was hosting 3 mutual friends from CA, visiting for the weekend.  This place prides itself for being one of the best values in the city of Pittsburgh.  Statements (I paraphrase) are littered all over the menu stating that \"One can't get the quality of meat we use anywhere else for as low a price as we charge\" for the burgers, and \"noone has ever been able to finish our fish sandwich because it's so large\".  And to top that, another printed sign as our centerpiece states (in a number of different font size and styles) \"byob! no corkage fee!\"  Although they do keep the place quite clean, i felt that the place had been worn past its time.  Environment typically doesn't affect my opinion of a place too much, however. The food itself was enough to render this place no more than 1 star to me.  Our server was friendly, although she seemed to have more trouble being able to hear everyone's voices in my party when we came to ordering our food. Our food did not take long to come out considering how full the restaurant was.  I had ordered a fish sandwich with waffle fries, while the rest of my party ordered burgers, some with waffle fries, others with shoestring fries.  A couple of points:  1. One should NEVER cut shoestring fries as thinly as they do. At that thickness, there's no way one can end up with successful fries after going through the fryer.  each of these ~1.5-2 inch fries were translucent from oil absorption, and all seemed to have a portion of skin, prompting me to wonder whether they just sliced up potato peelings to make these fries.  I've never seen something like this, and I hope I don't see it again.  2. You definitely get your fair share of meat, based on observation and testimony by my friends.  I can't make fair judgement of the taste of the burger as a whole, but based on the smell and little taste of the meat, it lacked any type of seasoning.  My fish sandwich was the blandest thing that I had ever tasted.  When I ordered, they asked me, \"Do you want any sauce with that?\"  Little did I know how crucial that sauce was needed to bring ANY flavor to my sandwich.  It was as if the cook literally defrosted the fish, threw it in flavorless batter, and threw it in the fryer.  The fish certainly took up a large area on my plate, but lacked any thickness, causing the whole fried filet to have the consistency of a chip than any type of fish.  The enriched flour bun that the fish sat on tasted like weeks-old bread that had been heated quickly on the grill.  Once again, it lacked all flavor.  1/4 way through my sandwich, I was starting to feel sick from the blandness.  I threw on some ketchup to save the sandwich.  1/3 way through, I had to take one side of the bun off and eat the fish sandwich open-faced.  1/2 way through, the amount of batter on the fish and the size of the overwhelmingly huge, stale, and dry bun was too much, and I decided to eat the rest of the sandwich with half the half-bun i had left, and took off half the batter on the fish.  Having finally barely downed the sandwich, I was starting to dry heave but kept my composure, as I was dining with guests in town.  3. Even the waffle fries were not completely crispy on the outside, and almost tasted as if they were left out for a bit before being served.  Because they were better than the shoestring fries, I exchanged these with my friend who had regrettably ordered the shoestring fries.  This place caters to those who value quantity over quality, and those who order food to accompany alcohol.  I'll be sticking to my other burger joints and fish sandwich joints in Pittsburgh.",

Waffle fries here are a guilty pleasure.  They also have salads with the fries here=p",

It seemed like your typical American grab grub and go place.  My friend ordered the hummus and pita chip appetizer.  It was pretty good and a nice touch was that some veggie skewers came along on the side.  Another friend of mine had the she-crab soup and I could smell the creaminess to it.  The best part about this place is how BIG their glasses are.  It would be easy to be a waitress here because you would NEVER have to worry about running around to do refills.  My coke was about a foot tall.  Seating was nice because the full-length window that looks out to the sidewalk can open up.",

It's not that the rules are particularly heinous, just that the rules are so blatantly advertised. First there's a big sign that says they won't seat you until your entire party is there. Then the menu has rules about no sharing, they will charge you extra. I think there were more rules on the menu than that, but I don't recall them exactly. I found these well advertised rules condescending, unnecessary and made me feel like they were doing ME a favour by letting me eat at their restaurant. Thanks, but no thanks.  There is nothing particular noteworthy about this place, except there are no other \"American\" translation \"Middle-class white suburban\" sit down restaurants on that part of Craig St.   I wasn't particularly impressed. They do not have the best burgers in the 'burgh or even Oakland. Maybe they have the  best burgers on Craig St. in between Forbes and Fifth Ave? I don't know, I haven't tried the burgers at that pizza place with the aluminum foil swans.",

I love the Turkey Burger (the beef is good too), with their french fries, and a tall glass of lemonade. They have excellent drink prices, and have some city fame for their wine specials. However, these deals also forced all these stipulations on the menu about loitering, how long you can stay, things/amounts of you money you should spend, etc. That's a turn off. The menu is simple but pleases all. The inside and small outside seating areas are cozy.  I love going here a few times a year, and I wish there was a steady twin in Philadelphia.",

Seemed like an odd one to get rid of since they listed the awards it had one right there on the menu.  Still, if you're in the mood for a high calorie True American meal, it is solidly good enough.",

My only complaint was with the waiter, up until it was time to pay he was very pleasant.  He assumed that we would either pooling our money to pay the bill or that one person would be picking up the tab, we informed him that we would need separate tabs and his mood changed dramatically.

A staff all dressed alike that distinguishes them from the guests...check.  All in all, I would say this place nailed it.  From the look of the inside to the friendliness of the staff.  Granted I did not dine in house, but I was able to scope out the place.  Upon arriving after I placed my order I walked in and was greeted warmly by the hostess who informed me that my order would be ready at the bar.  It was so very tempting standing by the bar and not ordering a drink.  But being that I was at work and on my lunch, I could not imbibe.  From the looks of the drinks that nearby patrons had, I may have to come this way for a nightcap.  Once the bartender was finished making up the drink she was in the process of perfecting, she was onto me.  Swiftly she grabbed my bag, rang up my bill and swiped my card.  After that I was out the door.  Once I was able to eye my food, I was not disappointed.  The turkey patty was enormous.  To say that it was flavorful would be an understatement.  The cooked it perfectly and somehow had this delicious crispiness surrounding the outside of the patty.  The bread was fresh, very fresh and slightly toasted.  I opted for their in house made mustard sauce and was that ever pleasing.  Creamy and with the best combination of spices made it compliment everything else that was on the patty.  No need to worry either if it will overpower the whole burger as everything melded together in my mouth.  That, my friends, is how you do a turkey burger.  Along with the burger came a pickle spear and a side of waffle cut fries.  Both good, but not as amazing as the burger itself.  I will definitely be back to get another turkey burger from here, and hopefully this time I will be able to sit and enjoy the atmosphere on the inside as well.",

Relative to your other options on Craig Street, this definitely deserves four stars.   I once tried what is probably their most well-known dish, the Devonshire sandwich, and I was very happy that it tasted a lot better than it looked. Apparently, it was reviewed by Bobby Flay on the Food Network a few years back. I'd recommend it without hesitation. I'm sure you've already seen reviews mentioning how great the waffle fries are, and you should take their word for it. I've had the tuna sandwich and heard wonderful things about the burgers too.   Lastly, for those who like to drink, you can do so without breaking the bank. I've seen plenty of people go their just for appetizers and wine. But there's also a decent selection of beers that the servers are very knowledgable about. It's a versatile place that I'd recommend if you're in the area.",

It is always busy especially at lunch time as they don't have a ton of tables. Love the big round table at the front window which is great for large groups.  This past visit we had a large party and they let me make a lunch reservation. I called a few days before to confirm and all was good until we showed up- they had no idea of our reservation and no tables!  I was pretty upset but the hostess took care of it quickly without me having to really say anything. By taking care of it they asked an already seated table to move to another table. I think this is a huge no no in the restaurant business and I did feel bad for that table. Well we were finally seated and the restaurant was packed. That did not affect the service and we put our order in and we're served quickly. I went with the large Cesar salad ( they offer a smaller Iunch size of most salads on the menu) with a bowl of the matza ball soup. The soup was fabulous with carrots and chicken broth. The salad was fresh topped with a warm breadstick and creamy dressing. Others in our party went with the Pittsburgh salad with chicken which you have a few options- I highly recommend buffalo chicken and asking for blue cheese dressing on your salad.  They have a number of sandwiches and burger options as well.    Save room for dessert as they always have some sort of fresh baked pie.",

The food is well made american/bar food. I really love the make your own grilled cheese where you can choose 3 different things to be on it (it used to be four, but they lowered it). They have surprisingly good fish tacos that are 1) gigantic and 2) have sriarcha mayo sauce thingy that's delicious. Dear lord, the turkey devonshire is like a heart attack, but wowza is it good! Drinks wise, if you order a beer, be prepared for like 20 oz (not the standard 16) - it's a nice surprise and well priced! They also have rotating taps, so they have a great seasonal selection of beer.  Keep in mind that if you go at lunch time, you WILL have to wait. We all love this place, so tons of people go for lunch there. I've found that going around 1:15 results in very little wait time. Just try to avoid the rush times and you'll love it.",

Service was great - especially at seating large tables, of which we were - and everyone was pretty friendly.  The decorations consist of board game posters, which is an A+ in my book.  The food is pretty great.  I had some sort of grilled cheese where you can pick 3 items to put into it.  Bree, Roasted Red Peppers, and Feta - mmmmmm.  Perfect food to mix with a good beer and all the other attendant goodies - including WAFFLE FRIES.  Oh, it's been too long since I've had them and I'm happy we were able to reconnect.  This place may be busy, but definitely give it a try.  Portions are good, a lot of people will find what they want on the menu (perhaps not vegan friendly, alas), and good beers all around.  And did I mention the board game posters?",

The only downfall is that it is constantly packed with college students, but don't let that deter you.  Let me start off with the waffle fries, these are honestly some of the best seasoned waffle fries that I have ever tried. The Turkey Devonshire is to absolutely die for. Its pretty much just a turkey sandwich with bacon slices and covered  with a rich creamy cheese sauce. It is very rich though, so watch out.  (For those that don't know, the sandwich originated in Pittsburgh in the 30's. Invented by Frank Blandi  who first served the sandwich at The Stratford Club in Shadyside). And i must say, it is a hugeee sandwich, I was only able to finish a third of it.  Something you must get after you think you have filled yourself with great food is the table side s'mores. O.M.G, while it is just your regular everyday s'mores, its just so much fun to do it at your table!  I you ever find yourself on Craig, definitely venture to the Union Grill and give it a try!",

Portions ARE huge, so be sure to get a to-go box because even after a night in the fridge my leftovers from Union Grill have held up.",

I got a burger here the first time I went, and while it's reasonably tasty, they are so large that if you make it through one you regret it.  I have since switched to the fish tacos which are quite delicious and much more manageable.  FYI, they'll let you do grilled fish instead of fried.  Get the waffle fries; they're super tasty.  Those and the wine are the reason to come here.  Unfortunately you have to get an entree to meet the minimum for the $10 wine list, but the waffle fries will carry you through.",

On my most recent trip, I ordered the turkey Devonshire, based on the comments of other reviewers, and since I'm always keen to try local specialities.  Although it was filling, I found it a bit bland in flavor.  My dining companion ordered the \"barbecue\" chicken (read: roast chicken with barbecue sauce) with waffle fries, both of which were good.  During past visits, I've ordered the church pierogies, which are a good specimen of the dish for PGH (I've heard that they get them from a local church, though I can't vouch for it), and come with a generous helping of sour cream and caramelized onions on top.  Though I've never personally ordered from it, they have a $10 wine list, which my labmate tells me contains wines that sell for at least twice that at the upscale bars in PGH.  (I'll have to try it next time I return.)  Service is generally good, and I like the atmosphere.  (Try to get one of the outdoor tables if the weather's nice!)  3.5 stars.",

The food and service are pretty decent, but they aren't really anything you can't find anywhere else.  Between the two of us, we have pretty much tried everything on the menu and nothing really sticks out as being superlative (except maybe the waffle fries).  The old stand-bys are the fish sandwich, the French dip and the salmon salad.  During the warm weather the Union Grill offers a lovely opportunity for al fresco dining on Craig Street.  Unfortunately, because of the lax smoking rules in Pittsburgh, there's always someone standing 5 feet from you smoking a cigarette.  Because of that, we sadly always have to eat inside.   I do like if you order a soda, that you get it in a gigantic glass - this avoids the need for your server to keep running back and forth, refiling pop.  Their alcoholic drinks are somewhat more expensive than the other bars in Oakland, so between that and the fact the place closes so damn early (I think 10 during the Summer), the PIC and I rarely go there unless we are too hungry or lazy to think of anywhere else go.",

Following more than 4 hours enjoying many of the treasures at the Carnegie Museums I was very hopeful of finding a local spot where I could rest my sore feet and enjoy a late lunch. Thankfully I made one right hand turn and ended up at the Union Grill.  The place filled the bill for me. I sat at the bar and was immediately assisted by Laura who remained friendly and helpful throughout my meal. I opted for the BBQ-style sandwich w/ cole slaw and fresh fruit ( I'm afraid the good Dr. has advised me to reduce my intake of waffle fries...ugh.). The order arrived quickly and well presented, The bun, fruit and tasty pickle were all fresh. While the hefty sandwich was a bit difficult to eat without decorating my shirt, it was very tasty and hot. At about $18 including tip, my lunch was an excellent value.     Union Grill has a good selection of beer (I'm not a big $10/bottle wine guy), what appeared to be an efficient staff and a clean restroom. When combined with the tasty food and a location near the Carnegie Museums/Carnegie Mellon and Pitt, it's a place I'm recommending to any of my friends who might find themselves in the neighborhood. I hope you'll enjoy it as well.",

PROS! +Nice atmosphere - Dark wood, good lighting, bistro tables outside (weather permitting), and front of the building completely open when it is nice outside. This place has a good vibe, kind of masculine but somehow cozy. +BEER  - Decent beer selection, full bar, nice place to go after work and relax. +Portions - Expect a lot of food for your money. Even the soda cups are mega-sized. +Service - Friendly, professional, well groomed.  Cons: -Rules - They have a rule that your whole party must be with you when you are seated. I've seen them enforce it, and let me tell you who is happy with that situation when it is all said and done: no one, because it is kind of a nasty rule. It also seems they have stopped enforcing this rule because it makes customers cranky. -For you vegetarians, there's little to eat: potato and cheese pierogies, salad, fried thingies. The waffle fries are good though...  Good to know: It is great for lunch, but the turn around isn't quite quick enough if you are on a 30 min lunch break.  The restaurant is a decent size, but a group of 8 is probably on the high side of what they can accommodate for one party.",

    "text": "If you can actually get a seat, the Union Grill is quite the place.  We've been coming here for years, and although the menu is large and updated with specials, I always come back to the same thing: Pittsburgh chicken salad.  It's a huge salad, with little piles of veggies all over it: cucumbers, tomatoes, mushrooms.  It comes with grilled chicken, crispy, seasoned waffle fries and a hearty but soft breadstick.  The menu recommends the house garlic vinaigrette, but I really prefer this salad with the honey mustard dressing.  Honey mustard and waffle fries were just meant to be together.  My husband got the steakburger this time around, which was also quite good.  You can get this bunless or bun-ed, but make sure to order it with the cheese.  It's a creamy blend that makes all the difference in flavor.  We also got the hummus plate at our latest visit.  It, like the salad, has veggie piles, of red peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions, as well as a big heap of feta cheese.  The hummus and pita were awesome, but we ran out of pita early on and still had massive amounts of dippy stuff left.  The staff was super accommodating though, and I would presume we could have gotten a refill on pita if we'd asked.  They are currently promoting their $10 wine list - yes, that's $10 for a BOTTLE of wine, not just a glass - but we didn't get to check it out, as we went in for lunch.  They have a nice happy hour special in the evenings (I believe it's after 6, although I'm not 100% sure, and they don't have a website to verify).  Their drinks are quite good, especially their rocks margaritas.  I think this is one of the reasons it gets so packed.  Oh, one other small note that I love: they have those gigantic glasses for your water or pop, like the kind Pizza Hut always had in the 80s.  If you get a salty meal on a busy night, this will keep you stocked if your waiter is running around.  The biggest issue here is getting a table.  On the weekends, it fills up really quickly.  It's right between Pitt and CMU, and it's a reasonably-priced, but nice restaurant where you can take your parents when they come to visit, so there will be lines and waits quite frequently.  But if you time it well, this is a great place to check out!",

They definitely use a unique blend of cuts here, because the burgers don't taste like regular burgers. They're on the steak-y side, which is really nice.

These are typically quite good. +Beer selection isn't very big, but is solid  -Not particularly vegetarian friendly. If you're looking for a not meaty meal, don't go here. There are some options, but in general, my veg friends haven't been fans.  -No reservations, which makes it hard to go with large groups",

It was lit dimly, but there were lots of fun, seasonal decorations up. The staff were nice as well.  I ordered the UG chicken melt with sauteed mushrooms and roasted red peppers with the vegetable side (which turned out to be steamed baby carrots, green beans, and cauliflower). I was a little disappointed by the vegetables, which were kind of boring in terms of taste. They were also a little undercooked for my preferences. The sandwich was very good, though. The chicken was moist and tender with a hint of lemon flavor, and they were generous with the toppings (though not so much with the included tomato, lettuce, and red onion). The sandwich also came with a pickle. I got a pretty decent meal out of half the sandwich and the sides.   My friend ordered the tuna melt with the waffle fries, all of which looked delicious (the fries especially). I will have to order them the next time I visit! However, it's on the pricier side (compared to other businesses on the street) so it probably won't be for a while.",

It was juicy, tender, and perfect. I felt like I was eating a steak! I really don't like burgers, but this burger...I would go back anyday. One thing I had a problem with was the shoestring fries. Okay, like.. I feel like they took leftover parts of a potato and just tossed it in oil and called them fries. They are hard, tasteless, and oily. I ate 5-6, trying to salvage some taste...but utterly failed. However, the waffle fries are AMAZING!!!! I've never had waffle fries before and I have now declared them my favorite kind.   My friend got the Pittsburgh salad. I tried some and decided that I would have a burger over the salad any day. However, the salad was decent, though it seemed like a burger without a bun, replaced with chicken, and with more added lettuce. It had everything else a burger had like sauteed mushrooms, grilled onions, cheddar cheese, chunky tomato, etc.   I definitely recommend this place !",

There are oh so many reasons to love you:  1. $10 wine list! 2. Burger, medium-rare, with Stilton blue cheese, grilled onions, tomato, lettuce, avocado, bacon, and waffle fries on a beautiful, hearty, golden bun. 3. Good salads for when I feel guilty about my lack of vegetable intake 4. Gigantic portions  I could go on and on...  Alas, I have to admit that I haven't been the most faithful in our 4+ year relationship.  Yes, there's another restaurant I've been frequenting.  A younger one with, well, more sparkle.  But The Porch simply isn't the same.  Although it may have some new shiny dishes with more bells and whistles, I still feel so comfortable with you.

After being seated, our waiter seemed very brisk and uncaring. He didn't even bother to introduce himself (we later found out his name was Justin...only by eavesdropping on the old ladies next to us who were flirting with him!). After our very delicious meal (more on that to come!), he gave us our checks. My friend paid with a card, no problem. But I paid with cash. I knew with all the items we got, it would be at least $20 a person, so I laid down a 20 and began counting out some more cash to lay down. Justin came swooping in and snatched both our bills EVEN THOUGH I STILL HAD CASH IN HAND THAT I WAS ABOUT TO LAY DOWN. He returned to both of us and very brusquely told me what I already knew: that I needed to pay a little more. My bill was ~$23 so I put I accidentally put down $22 and he said with SO MUCH DAMN ATTITUDE, \"This is $22. The bill says $23.\" LISTEN SIR. If you gave me even 1 second to put down an extra $2 dollars, we wouldn't be in this predicament!   Taken aback, my friend and I were talking about his brisk attitude and came back and had the audacity to say \"Do we have a problem?\" YES. YES I DO HAVE A PROBLEM. The meal went swimmingly up until the last 3 minutes when we left pissed off.  Onward to sunnier topics...THE FOOD!!   I ordered the fish taco with sirracha sauce with red cabbage and corn salsa. Beyond the fact that the taco was literally the size of a small child (I'm kidding, but it actually was huge).  Let me tell you friends, IT WAS BANGIN!! So good. The cod was perfectly fried, flavorful, moist and just plain delicious.   My friend, on the other hand, went with the classic cheeseburger. This burger had cheese on the top AND bottom. She typically doesn't finish meals all the way through but this burger was apparently so good she could finished it all! She also got a baked sweet potato on the side that included this incredible brown sugar cinnamon butter spread. SO TASTY!  We also had to order off the $10 wine menu and got ourselves a bottle of Riesling because why not? I had never had Riesling before, but I'm glad I lost my  Riesling-ginity  here because, man, was it good!  For dessert we ordered the s'mores and received a cute little grill to toast our marshmallows. It was basically like we were out in the woods camping, except not really at all. But totally worth the order!   All in all, I highly recommend this place, minus the service. Maybe our pal Justin was having a rough day, who knows? Regardless, as paying customers whose combined bill was ~$50 not including tip, we deserved far better treatment.",

Fish, beef,  chicken were all finished to our our pleasure. Helen had the eggplant veggie bake, which kept her attention. The matzo ball soup made a stellar appearance before me, a few of our gathering had the opportunity to enjoy the almost world famous waffle fries. Dining with four new faces proved there are no strangers, just friends we have yet to meet. Good food in abundance, good company and good cheer in abundance. Every Friday night out should be like this. We are giving Union Grill a solid four stars.",

    "text": "Union Grill's been on my to-eat list for over 2 years now and I finally got around to coming here. As one of the more busy restaurants on Craig, I had pretty high hopes for the place, and I was pretty disappointed -- though I suspect this was due to what I ordered. The food was OK, quite expensive, slow to serve, and was quite frankly, just inferior to Stack'd in every way.  I got the Chop-House burger (I mean it's called Union Grill, why wouldn't I get a burger) and was presented with a monster of a burger. I struggled quite a bit with opening my mouth wide enough to even take a bite out of it, though I'd view this as a pro and not a con. The avocados looked quite strange/over-ripe (but this is Pittsburgh winter and I don't think I can really expect more) and the toppings looked pretty meh. The burger did taste pretty good, but it wasn't mind-blowing -- which is why I'm giving Union Grill a 2-star.   The problem is that there's a LOT of places in the area that do really good burgers -- for much cheaper. It sounds ridiculous but the burger place on CMU's campus last year made a burger that was very comparable in taste for less than half the price. The burger ended up being around $16, which is frankly ridiculous to me. For that price, I could have went to Five Guys or Stack'd and came out with change, and both of these places have comparable, if not better burgers.  All in all, quite a mediocre experience. If I wanted a burger, I'd have just gone to Stack-d. If I come here again, I'll probably order something more specific to them.   That being said, the waffle fries are very good though. Those are 5/5",

How can you go wrong with bacon and cheese sauce over turkey on toast? Oh right, if you're health conscious :)  Drink prices are reasonable.

Surprisingly I tried to come on a Monday at 6:30 pm and the place was packed with a wait for a table of two estimated at 45 minutes. So I came the next day around the same time and was seated immediately.  We spent a few minutes browsing the menu and ordered the cod burger ($12) and pub burger ($16). Our server brought us huge glasses of water. It took about 10-15 minutes before our food came out.  Wow! The portions are HUGE. And the burgers were very satisfying. The beef burger was very juicy and the cod was practically falling apart with every bite. It was soft and the breading was crispy and flaky. Adding tartar sauce was a good choice! I couldn't finish my meal so I took half the cod burger to go. However I got a baked sweet potato as a side and I finished that at the table. It was served with a delectable cinnamon sugar butter. The waffle fries to my surprise were not the highlight of my meal. They were okay, not living up to the hype. But the burgers? Man they were good.  Overall, I would come back to try the fish taco or chicken tenders. It is typical pub food though, so save your stomach or prepare for all that grease. I definitely want to try the $2 brownie sundae next time!",

The customization options on their burgers are really nice too - you can add some hefty toppings like carmelized onions and sauteed mushrooms for free.   Great place worth going to just for the fries alone, and great if you're in the mood for classic American cuisine",

    "text": "Stopped here after visiting the Carnegie Museum just because I was looking for somewhere that would appeal to everyone in our group and was close. I'm so glad we did.   We went around 3 in the afternoon and it was still fairly busy considering the odd time. I was super excited when I saw that have $5 Moscow Mules (complete with copper cup). I had the vanilla mule and it was delicious, served with a skewer of candied ginger and everything.   The waitress was extremely friendly and the service was fairly quick. When I saw her brining out our order, I couldn't believe the portion size. My boyfriend had the tuna melt, which he didn't care for but I loved; I had the American salad I think it was called (the one with the avocado) and it was awesome. I added blackened chicken which was great - perfectly spicy, and blue cheese dressing. They had a great blue cheese. My son also had a kids-sized hamburger and than goodness he did because it was giant.   My boyfriend and I will definitely be returning to take advantage of the $5 mules and we actually think that next time we will split a meal because they are so huge.  As a side note, I took home half of the tuna melt and heated it up later to snack on. It was still excellent.",

Our server was able to accommodate us to a nice long table in the back. We decided to order 3 bottles of  wine at $10 each--a Riesling, Pinot Grigio, and a basic red wine. This is where I found out you needed to purchase a minimum of $10 worth of food for each person in order to take full advantage of the $10 deal, otherwise you would have to pay $17-$20 per bottle of wine.   After we ordered our food, we received our wine within 10 minutes, which was great. However, it took approximately 35-40 minutes before any of us received our food. I understand that they wanted all of our food to arrive at the same time but it took a pretty long time, nonetheless.   When the food arrived, the portions were huge. Despite my friends being satisfied with the rather large portion of their dishes, I didn't really hear anyone say that the food was amazing. I'd say my highlight of the evening was toasting the marshmallows to my s'mores. Also, I was around good conversation and good company.   Overall, I'd have to say that the food was just okay, but nothing too memorable. And though our server was nice, the service was a bit slow, even after the crowd started to dissipitate towards closing time. This place is a solid 3 in my book.",

A little bland, but I was informed that this is slightly normal for pierogi's, especially if you are used to other types of dumplings.   We also ordered hummus.  This was fantastic.  It came with a generous serving of hummus as well as pita, olives, tomatoes, peppers, and other toppings to combine and eat with the hummus.   Our third and last item was the Matzo ball soup.  Very delicious Matzo ball soup.  Extremely simple, but bursting with flavor.  This was hands down the best item we ordered.",

The two times I've been here for dinner I've come in large groups - around 8-10 people. Because they don't take reservations, you have to wait around an hour to actually get a table. Then once you get a table and order, it takes at least another 30-40 minutes to get your food. I know service is generally longer for larger groups but this place is particularly slow.  The first time I got the pot roast and the second time I got the six grain veggie. I thought the pot roast was good at first but then after the sauce ran out I realized it was actually quite dry. The veggie sandwich was good - but it didn't taste as good as the description sounded. My boyfriend got the steak burger and turkey Devonshire - the turkey entree was okay, and the burger was pretty good. I've also gotten the French onion soup as a starter which I liked.  I also did come once for lunch - this time only in a group of 2. While we were seated immediately, it still took awhile to get our food - not ideal for lunch. I got the turkey burger with sweet potato fries. The turkey burger was good, the sweet potato fries - eh I've had better. The one good thing I will say is that the portions here are pretty big - you will probably take home some leftovers!   Some of the food at this place is good - but I don't think it's worth all the waiting. If you're in a large group, go somewhere else.",

Their portions were probably the most memorable; for a meal meant to be eaten individually, it is usually pretty difficult for one person to finish the whole thing in one sitting. I understand if the expectation is for people to take the rest home, but would it be too much to ask to provide a smaller serving option at a cheaper price? After a certain point I stopped enjoying my meal and just debated whether to keep stuffing myself or to take it home and eat the same thing again later.  That said, I should also note that they have a $10 wine list, which can be pretty cool if you have an occasion going on.",

It also comes with a nice size of waffle fries, which the ketchup condiment goes quite well with. I've also gotten the Indoor Smores when coming with friends prior, which is essentially what the title mentions: an indoor campfire party minus smelling like smoke afterwards. Seems to be quite a popular place in general ... good for groups. I wouldn't use it for intimate gatherings (dates) though as it can get quite loud here ... there are certainly better places to go for that haha.

It was a bunch of ingredients thrown onto a tortilla and that was it. I've had better attempts of fish tacos at Rubio's. This was a True testament that sometimes it's better to get quality then quantity.   We had dessert of S'mores and that was probably their only saving grace. Although it's nothing more than your normal ingredients, but the fact that they served it there made the end a little more tolerable.",

    "text": "Unfortunately I had two poor experiences here. On those two occasions I received pleasant and timely service so my complaints are exclusively with the food.    My girlfriend and I were busy in Oakland, feeling hungry, tired, and not particularly adventurous food-wise, and this place seemed like an old pair of comfortable shoes. I ordered the Turkey Devonshire since it is hyped on the menu. As soon as it arrived, I could tell I made a bad choice. It looked and tasted bland, dry, and oddly reminiscent of something an aunt brings to a large family function that you eat slowly and begrudgingly out of politeness. Since I was starving I did my best to work it down and chalked it up to bad luck. The pierogies were okay.   On our second trip I was determined to enjoy myself. I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich, (with the mistaken conviction that grilled cheese sandwiches are impossible to fuck up) picking caramelized onions and roasted red peppers as my toppings, also substituting my side with a caesar salad. The food arrived promptly, and though the appearance of the food improved, the first bite of the sandwich and \"oh NO, not again!\"  The grilled cheese sandwich was soggy and you couldn't taste the cheese at all because the red peppers and onions (which were neither caramelized nor roasted) were PILED on, giving it a mushy quality that generated some bonafide body shudders. I suppose I share some responsibility in this for my choice of toppings. Maybe it threw them off-balance? I set the sandwich aside and hoped to at least enjoy my salad but quickly discovered that several pieces were thoroughly brown. Dispirited, I spent the rest of my meal concentrating on getting drunk, which was the only grand success of the evening. Again, the pierogies were merely okay.    My girlfriend's rating of the food on both occasions was \"meh,\" which is enviable considering how comically unpleasant my experience turned out. While writing this I asked her if she remembered what she had. \"No.\"  That's probably for the best.    I doubt this is a common occurrence at the Union Grill, which has many positive reviews and seems to be a popular place, but the fates are cruelly intent on keeping me out. Maybe I just had the dumb luck of selecting the two shittiest things on the menu. Maybe all the regulars know not to get grilled cheese with caramelized onions and roasted red peppers or the Turkey Devonshire and the rest of the food is amazing. In any case, I hope you have better luck than I do.",

We normally go for the chicken sandwiches or the cheeseburgers, which feature a variety of ingredients as well extremely tasty waffle fries.  If you like mustard at all, I would definitely order some of their homemade mustard on the side since it is some of the best mustard I've ever had (coming from a mustard lover).  I do have a few gripes however.  Some of the staff here are clearly miserable based on their permanent frowns no matter when we come, and on one occasion we overheard our waiter criticize another parties \"poor tip\" while he was talking to the busboy in the middle of the restaurant.  We have also experienced extremely slow or otherwise poor service a few times such as being ignored by our waitress for half an hour intervals.

My only knock is they used to have killer sweet potato chips that were an option as a side.  I went there recently and they no longer have them...I asked the waitress and she explained that they have been gone awhile but she gets a lot of requests for the homemade chips.  Hopefully, the owners/decision makers will read this review and think about adding these back to the menu....I may start going 2-3 times a month again!!!",

Also, it's one of the few places near campus where I can get a dine-in meal without breaking the bank. Today I dropped in for the Craig Street Chicken Strips. They were delicious! The batter was flaky and a golden brown. Service was great. We finished our meal and they told us to stick around as long as we liked since the Steelers game was on. $10 wine list is also a great perk of this place.",

I liked the variety of the menu and the veggies tasted fresh. This isn't the first place I would go looking for a healthy meal, but I was pleasantly surprised that the veggies were steamed without oil and the sweet potato that I had for my side was plain. As with most places, just order carefully to lighten up your meal. My table ordered a $10 bottle of Bordeaux and it was good! All in all, a good experience and I would go back if I happened to be in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way to make a return trip.",

Even the wait staff, who are fantastic, have no idea why he took it off the menu!! They even went so far as to guarantee that it'd be back on the menu by the end of the year since it's so popular. Can't wait for that so that we can go back!",

We arrived on a cold Sunday in January just before 5pm and were sat right away. It got much more busy over the next hour so you might want to call ahead since parking isn't exactly suburban. The pot roast comes with mashed red potatoes, which were good, and the vegetable of the day which was broccoli. The broccoli was a total miss. It was over cooked and didn't go well with a dish that was begging for carrots. The pot roast nevertheless was very good. The red wine and tomato added to the beef stock made it distinctive and delicious.  You get a large portion, much more than you should probably eat. I ate it all anyway so I had to skip even considering dessert!",

A favorite of some of the locals I met up with, and with good reason, they have a menu that is sprawling with amazing gastropub fare, and amazing isn't even enough to describe it all. From matzo ball soup and perogies, waffle fries and various other starters, to a variety of fish, chicken, burgers and beef, you're sure to be in for a foodie delight. I perused the menu while our waitress worked our table of 6, and she rocked it, making us all quite pleased! But the food...my goodness THE FOOD!!!! I ordered the matzo ball soup, to huge matzo balls in a delicate broth properly seasoned with parsley and green onion lacing the broth with a savory but not overpowering taste. The burger - I went big. The Pittsburger. It was nothing shy of whoa! A huge burger, topped with pierogi, slaw, cheddar, bacon and Buffalo sauce, served with waffle fries and everything bwas right with the world. The burger was intense, the waffle fries were perfection. Bravo!",

My family and I had a rough day and needed something warm and soothing for lunch.  We were seated at a back corner booth and ordered a mess of food to share....both appetizers and main dishes.  The salad we got was filled with a perfectly grilled chicken breast, tons of veggies, avocado, bacon chunks and a delicious homemade ranch dressing.  The potato and cheese pierogis were just average.  They were topped with melted shredded cheese and served with sour cream, but they were slightly on the greasy side.  The chicken tenders with waffle fries and homemade honey mustard dressing were perfectly on point.  We all loved the honey mustard so much we ordered more and also another order of fries just so we could dip!  Everyone wanted a bite of the turkey Devonshire.  It was rich, creamy and super-filling topped with bacon slices and that cheese sauce bubbling straight out of the oven with a charred surface to it.  Yum, yum, yum!  I thought we were done, then our younger daughter decides she wanted a dessert...and who could resist a $2 brownie sundae?  The mini brownie sundae was cute, with a brownie that was slightly underdone (loved it) and served warm with vanilla ice cream.  From there, we simply crawled back to our daughter's dorm in our food-induced coma.  Thank you, Union Grill!!!",

The wait staff is really nice and although they become less attentive when it's busy, it's understandable.   I really like the seafood at this place, especially the salmon. I've never tried the burgers but the salads are great too. Their portions are huge like many have said. For the fish taco, the price point between the cod fish and the salmon may deter ppl from ordering the salmon but it's so much better than the cod!! The cod doesn't really taste like much and it's more like all the different sauces and stuff on the taco that makes it good but the salmon is even better because it tastes good even without all the sauces and such. I usually get the salmon dinner and it's so good! The sides (I get coleslaw and fries) are also v tasty.   I like that this place serves a lot of different groups. It's very close to CMU so there are a lot of students but a lot of older folks come here too. Every time I come to Pittsburgh I come here so I definitely recommend it!",

They're also open between normal meal hours, so in case you're doing an early dinner or late lunch, they've got you covered. They have a bunch of beer/wine options, but I opted for their seafood instead. Decent portion size for the price, tasted pretty fresh and was a filling meal.   Their side options also include waffle fries vs regular fries, and those were fried to just the perfect crispy texture. Staff was pretty polite, though the restaurant itself looked like it could've been cleaned a bit more. All in all, I had an enjoyable meal for a decent price and it's got plenty of room to seat a lot of people.",

I guess it's nice that they serve such a wide demographic, age-wise.   I got the Pittsburgh salad (apparently adding \"Pittsburgh\" to it means adding French fries?), and a Canadian Mule - drink specials are like unicorns to me, being from puritanical Boston. Both were perfectly adequate. I would frequent go to Union Grill if I was a co-ed looking to get great value for what I pay, or maybe a senior who holds great nostalgia for the place...?   There's a lot to choose from, and the food was good!",

My favorite dishes to get at this place are the roast beef and the jumbo crab cake dinner. The dishes are a little expensive (for a college student so about $20) but the portion sizes are huge. I usually enjoy coming here after working out or if I had a light lunch and am looking for a place to have dinner. The flavor in the crab cakes and roast beef is great and the side vegetables I like to get are usually cooked well.  A few down sides is that the food is pretty heavy and that the service can get a bit slow in the evening. Overall though, Union Grill is a great place to go and I'd recommend it for anyone seeking to get their money's worth and fill themselves with a hearty meal.",

They have a small but very good rotating list o drafts; usually something local from East End, and some interesting things from Green Flash, Victory, Bell's, Fat Head's etc.  At one time they had what they called the oversize pint, which was an 18oz glass.  That certainly hit the spot.  Recently those were replaced with 10oz and 14oz mugs, which was okay because they kept the prices in line.  My one and only gripe now is that they started serving the mugs frosted.  You will never find a brewpub serving their beer in a frosted mug because it negatively affects the taste.  So that's my one star off, and hopefully they'll change that.    As far as the food goes, I've had plenty of good items, but the classic fish taco is so good I almost always end up getting that.  Still not tired of it; and it sets the bar very high for any other business selling a fish taco.",

I only ever went here when my friends near CMU wanted to go, back before I'd made the vegan switch and was still vegetarian. At one point, they offered a Build-your-own veggie burger with a homemade patty that was outstanding! Unfortunately it didn't last, I think they replaced it with a similar deal for grilled cheeses now. I've asked about the veggie burger every time I've been back, in hopes that they will bring it back with enough requests.  The hummus plate and Greek salads are also good, but if you're vegan, you'll want to hold the feta, and no breadstick. Those are pretty much your only good choices, although the grilled veggie sandwich might be an option without the provolone.",

Feel free to have a seat at the bar until they arrive.\"  I glanced barward.  Smart suits and ties, polished oxfords.  Where was I?  I thought to myself.  What in God's name are these people on about?   I sidled up akin a middle aged woman, her dried out blonde hair had given way to brunette roots, a sprinkle of grey visible from my proximity.  She sipped a cocktail of some kind, probably some kinda vodka.  I signaled to the barkeep, asked for a whiskey;  I had a gut ache from the night before and only the hair of the dog could combat it.  \"Seven fifty\", the barman said sliding a curled slip of white paper my direction.  I fingered around my changepurse, pulling out a handful of all I could find.  \"This is robbery,\" I said as I tossed the money his way.  The entryway bell jingled and I looked back hoping to see my companions.  No such luck.  An elderly couple dressed like they just come from a church service stood there, the woman's yellow scarf waving in the soft breeze.  I guessed my comrades weren't gonna make it.  Maybe they'd been caught?  Or worse.  I put the thought out of my head and my mind rested easy on the sack of loot on my back and the warm sixgun by my side. You know, a guy like me could add quite a few more greenbacks to today's haul in a place like this.  My hand fell to my side.",

    "text": "I met a friend here for lunch on a Thursday at noon.  Though there were plenty of tables when I first arrived, it started to fill up quickly - clearly a hoppin' lunch spot!    Since I had a few minutes to myself before my friend arrived, I looked over the menu and I was really impressed with what I'll call their \"attitude\" toward serving alcohol.  They are apparently famous for their $10 wine list, and it says on the menu that they believe people shouldn't have to pay a premium to enjoy wine with their food, so they serve wine/beer basically at cost.  And all drinks are half-off every single day from 6-9pm.  All that made me wish I was there for dinner so it would be appropriate to have a drink!  Instead, alas, it was just lunch, so I stuck with water - served in a ginormous glass so nobody needed to refill me.  I ordered the tuna melt with swiss cheese and waffle fries.  The sandwich was pretty huge - I could only eat half of it before I was full.  I thought it was very tasty, and I know a tuna melt isn't always the most appetizing thing when done improperly, but I liked their spin on it.  The cheese was melted and yummy.  It was a bit awkward to eat, being so big, the filling had a hard time staying contained in the bread.  The fries were a nice accompaniment as well.  It took us forever to signal to our waiter for the check, which is not normally a big deal, but at lunch on a weekday people usually want to get in and out within an hour, so perhaps he could have been a bit more attentive.  I have the feeling that if I return for dinner to take advantage of the drink specials, and the food is still as good or better, I'll be adding a four-star review!",

They usually don't have a long wait if you don't have a reservation and the staff is really friendly and checks up on you frequently.   I usually only got the Rich Boy sandwich. Ciabatta bread loaded with shrimp, celery and some other stuff. My friends and I would usually all order this because it tasted like Heaven. I have tried the crab cake sandwich which isn't too bad but it is not as good as the Rich Boy. I did start getting the crab cakes as an appetizer though. For the fries, make sure you get the waffle fries. They are absolutely delicious and complement the sandwiches completely. I have also tried the buffalo chicken salad with blue cheese dressing which is topped with waffle fries and that too is also terrific. However, If you want a good sandwich, get the Rich Boy. Best shrimp sandwich out there.",

Not long ago, they nixed it from the menu, probably because they weren't making much money off of it. I *BEG* you, bring it back! The desserts at Union Grill are so inexpensive ($4.50 I think), but I would *gladly* pay much more than that for the Chocolate Silk Pie.

One thing that you might like when you step inside is the warm interior with soft lights and dark, wood-paneled booths. When the lights go down, this place definitely kicks up in coziness points. It may not be the ideal place for a date, since it can get fairly crowded, but for going with friends it's alright.  I had the 4-hour pot roast myself. It's a fairly heart combination of your choice of a side (I had the sweet potato, it was pretty good), steamed vegetables, and some thick slices of a tender, crumbly pot roast that definitely lives up to its name. Everything I had was a bit on the buttery and rich side (from the beef juices) so if you're looking to eat light, the pot roast may not be for you.  All told, not a bad night at all. The only knock I'll give it right now is on price, which is a tad too expensive but not too much to be griping about. I'll probably go again in the future, because there are definitely other options on the menu that I'd like to explore (particularly their sandwiches).",

The ambiance is excellent.  Very comfortable and home-y.  Also, when the sidewalk seating is available, it is just top-notch.  They also don't turn you down if you go at 11:50pm and want a few drinks.  In fact, they check up in 10 minutes to see if you want more.  Really nice staff.

I used to always get their burgers (with guac and brie or provolone) and a side of waffle fries, which was always satisfying and way more than you need for a meal. Lately I've been ordering their fish tacos, which is also way more than you can eat in a one meal, and so tasty. And of course, I choose waffle fries for my side every time because they are amazing. If you go to Union Grill, you must get waffle fries! I've also tried their French onion soup (pretty thick but good), nachos (share with at least two others!), hummus (comes with a variety of vegetables), and s'mores (you might set your marshmallow on fire if you're an amateur like me). The only thing I've ever really had a problem with here is that it can be a pretty long wait for food and the check sometimes.

I thought maybe the $10 wine list could help me get to like this place more, but the wines they chose were not great. Maybe that list rotates, and wine is a highly subjective thing, but I was not a fan.",

They sometimes give you fresh popped popcorn while you wait for your entree (I've only sat at the bar, so not sure if this is True for tables, too).

I informed the waitress and to my dismay she didn't offer to remove it from the bill.  So I deducted it from her tip.",

    "text": "Spoiler alert - I would drive 4 hours for the Union Grill Turkey Devonshire. No question.   For the past several years, my family and I have travelled from Washington DC to Pittsburgh to attend an Irish Dance competition and one year a UPitt student recommended Union Grill (UG). Since then, we've eaten here at least three times over the years and it is one of our favorites for a Sunday meal. We've had dinner and brunch here and the staff and ambiance make it a destination restaurant. Yes, there are lots of great places to eat in Pittsburgh and so if you're looking for a good \"stick to your ribs\" meal at an affordable price, look no further than this always comfortable and welcoming eatery. Service is friendly and attentive - thank you, Drew - portions are generous, the quality of the food is top-notch, prices are more than reasonable, and the overall experience is outstanding.   This afternoon we stopped for dinner and again, we had an amazing experience. My 17 year-old started with the Matzo Ball soup (her standard fare) followed with the pot roast Pierogi appetizer (big enough for a meal, no doubt). Pierogies are filled dumplings from Eastern Europe and are accompanied with pickled red cabbage, a nice dollop of their UG mustard, and fresh sour cream- a very flavorful and satisfying combo for a typical rainy cold day. My wife opted for the UG Fish Sandwich, which looked like a full family-sized fillet of cod beautifully fried and served with a freshly made bun and fixings - today's vegetable was cauliflower florets perfectly steamed. Yummy.   For myself, I eat just about EVERYTHING, so my typical approach is to ask the server what their favorite dish is - she mentioned both the Fish Tacos and the Turkey Devonshire. Ok, hard choice for me and while the thought of having a Tryptophan-laden, cheesy, carb-filled dish before a 4-hour drive back to DC was a little daunting, I went ahead and opted for the Turkey Devonshire. When in Rome....  So what is a Turkey Devonshire??? A native from Pittsburgh knows that this is traditionally an open-faced sandwich made with turkey on toast, which is covered with tomatoes and a thick cheddar cheese sauce, and finally topped with bacon. Now before you check your blood levels, let me say that the UG version of this is worth every bite. It's not something you can eat every week / day / minute of your life, but it is something you'll dream about once you have it. UG serves it in a ceramic skillet and the fresh roasted turkey is thickly cut and served atop toast points. The cheese sauce is not gummy, not artificial, and not overwhelming - my fear was that the cheddar would coat the turkey and make for a very gooey mess. I'm unsure how they do it, but the sauce has an amazing flavor and consistency reminiscent of a classic veloute sauce and while it covers the dish, it is not overpowering, but serves as a wonderful complement to first-rate turkey, tomatoes, and toast points.   The best way for me to describe the UG Turkey Devonshire is that it is what your Thanksgiving turkey leftovers taste like in heaven.   No joke - I would drive 4 hours for this dish alone. Amazing meal.  Bonus points! After eating something that cheesy and carb-filled, I'm ready for a nap and the last thing I want to do is get on the road for a long drive. I'm convinced that UG uses top-notch, non-artificial ingredients because this driver was not sleepy nor bloated, nor regretful in the least. Not sure how they do that, but there's some magic happening in their kitchen.   Thank you, Union Grill. I look forward to my next trip to Pittsburgh.

    "text": "I came here with a friend on a Thursday evening closer to 8pm after going to the museum of art. They had free admission Thursdays in March from 4-8pm and when we got to this place it was packed. The hostess said they didn't know why it was so busy for a Thursday. We felt like since this place is in close proximity to the museum they could be up to date on the events going on in their neighborhood. We were the first in there waiting for a table and a few other groups came in behind us. I'd say we got a table within 10 minutes. We were seated towards the rear with my back facing another table. It was right where employees were walking in between tables so I felt like I was in the way. To our left two other parties were seated after us and they were served first with water and food. It did take a little bit before a waitress came over to even say hello, but that's because I doubt they were prepared staff-wise for a Thursday night crowd...hence being aware of happenings going on in your neighborhood.  Each menu that was handed out had an insert with their specials. I saw a salmon burger and got excited to order that. So I decided on an appetizer of pot roast pierogies and a salmon burger with homemade guacamole. When it was time to order, our waitress quickly cut me off and said they were out of their salmon burger. I was bummed and kind of wished they took out the special insert in their menu. Again, I don't think they had enough hands for help. So after looking over the menu again, I decided on a crabcake sandwich with homemade guacamole and waffle fries.   When my pierogies came out, they were laid out on a long platter on top of a bed of chopped red cabbage. I think it was pickled and I commented a few times on how good the cabbage was. As for the pot roast pierogies..honestly forgettable. There were three of them that were a good size and they came with tasty mustard. My sandwich came out on a brioche bun that seemed to overpower the actual crabcake that was smaller. I was disappointed with the small amount of homemade guacamole on top, but the amount I did have was good. I personally love my guacamole! The waffle fries took over my plate and they were definitely delicious. Their portions are large as others have mentioned. My sandwich came with a side of pickle, lettuce, tomato, and red onion. I piled everything on top and took a bite. I was pleased with my crabcake...yum! Points for that! One thing I made a comment on and did appreciate was how big their water cups were. I felt like it was enough to keep me going a while without the waitress having to constantly refill them. At the end we split a brownie sundae that came with a small side of hot fudge, a generous brownie, whip cream, and one scoop each of vanilla and mint chocolate chip ice cream. The brownie was average and flat in taste, but the whole thing together created great flavors. Satisfying.  Our service wasn't anything out of this world because everyone seemed pretty rushed. The waitress was nice and accommodating to the best of her ability. The food I got was above average and our atmosphere was really noisy. Since we were close to other tables we felt like we were all having a \"who could talk the loudest\" competition just so the person across could hear. I would definitely come again on a slower night to enjoy myself and possibly try an adult beverage. I still want that salmon burger!",

    "text": "My dear friend Maria was supposed to head back to Columbia the Saturday before Easter. She ended up postponing her trip ('till June!!!!) so we decided to have a dinner to catch up & chat. She had been to Union Grill & we always planned on coming since we live 2 blocks away as a double date. A few times it was under construction and eventually finals and her packing to move created hectic schedules. Thankfully, we were finally able to make it.  Our server was Ashley and she was a sweetie. Maria had a late lunch and only ordered the loaded nachos. I tried some and they were great. I ordered the chicken dinner special, which is only available after 5pm and until they run out. I couldn't decide if I wanted the herb crusted or BBQ. Ashley suggested the herb with a side of BBQ sauce to experience both. I'm glad that I had decided that because the chicken dinner is huge. I have no idea how I wouldn't successfully managed that chicken lathered in BBQ sauce. The veggie of the day was brussel sprouts and I also got to choose another side. I chose the baked sweet potato which came with a side of cinnamon butter. Baked potatoes are only available after 4pm. I really enjoyed my dinner.  We were full & didn't get dessert, but the s'mores platter looked great! It comes with graham crackers, Hershey bar, marshmallows & your own little grill to roast the marshmallows! (FYI: you have to order food in order to get this certain dessert. You can't just go in for it specifically) Maria had it before and said it was her and 3 friends and they still couldn't finish it. I'll be sure to save room for it next time around! The other dessert option is a (brownie?) sundae. You don't have to order food to receive that.  We decided to chat over a cup of coffee after dinner. Maria ordered hers black and I asked for cream. I waited a little while for the cream and finally the server came back for the bill. Maria brought up about the cream & Ashley brought out a fresh coffee and took it off my tab; A kind gesture and she was really nice about it.   Our time here was fun. I'm excited to bring bobby here. He would really love this place.  As if it hasn't been mentioned before, the $10 wine list had multiple options and seemed like a great deal.",

Great selection of beers and it looks like they change the draft offers all the time.  It's cute and cozy inside. And, for what's basically a bar environment, it's pretty kid-friendly!",

The open face turkey with the bechamel sauce was off the hook, as were the pirogies that are house made and the cod sandwich. My only ding is that they rely way too much on distractions. The pirogies stand out on their own, and the shredded cheese and limp of sour cream heaped on top take away from it, even though I know that's tradition. Out with a little of the old and in with a bit of new to up the flavor fame. The turkey sandwich is house bird, thick cut, ridiculously good!",

    "text": "Union Grill was the one of the places I somehow never ate at while I was a student, even though a good friend absolutely loved it (well, it and the $10 wine bottle list they offered - I didn't catch if they still offer this or not now, but I hope they do!). Since graduation I'd honestly kind of forgotten about it. So when a group of people and I more or less stumbled in here after another place was too busy and had no room for us, I figured that I needed to do more than just enjoy a single drink while I was here.  So normally I think Union Grill is a no-frills grub and drink sort of place, but when we came in it was pretty cutesy looking since it was decorated for V-Day. Picture hearts and streamers everywhere, and you've got the decor they had going on here. I actually remember thinking to myself that the decorations combined with the dim (but not TOO dim) lighting will make for a decent date spot, at least for students.  Way more memorable and important than the decorations, however, was the service. Once we'd been seated an excellent waiter came right over to warn us that the place would no longer accept orders after 9:00pm, which was when they officially closed. Note that we came in and we were seated around 8:55pm. So we did have to order quickly before the kitchen closed, but at that point we were just happy that they were allowing us in given how late it was; they could have easily told us they were closing and no more people were welcome, and if they had we would have ended up walking back out into the cold looking for another place to grab a drink and a bite to eat.  After quickly skimming the menu three of us ordered grilled cheese sandwiches (Union Grill allows you to add 3 toppings to a grilled cheese sandwich here - I ordered guacamole, mushrooms and bacon) while one person ordered fish or chicken (I honestly forget which). We also all ordered a variety of ciders and beers to go with our meals; I personally ordered the smaller drink size, and the result was that my arsenal cider looked like a baby drink next to the bigger ones. But hey, it was arsenal cider and it was good and that's really all that matters in my book.  As for the food? I have to say, the grilled cheese I was ordered was absolutely delicious - it wasn't overly toasted so it didn't crunch into pieces whenever I took a bite, and there was a great a balance of mushrooms and guacamole to boot. Also, the waffle fries the sandwiches game with? Just wonderful - not too crunchy, well seasoned, and honestly just what I'd expect in a good order of waffle fries. Everyone else looked as satisfied as I was as we chatted, ate and enjoyed our drinks until the place turned on the lights and we knew it was time to head out so they could clean and go home.  After the experience I had here I would totally return to make up for my never eating here as a student. Union Grill may not be the flashiest place in Oakland but the food is still wonderful for what it is, and the great staff that was working here during my visit elevate the place a lot in my mind. Next time I stop in I'll definitely check to see if they still offer their \"wine bottle for $10\" deal - that would just be the cherry on top of this place if they did!",

Their menu consists of a lot of what I consider American comfort food and they often seasonally update it. If you decide to go during the fall, I recommend the Turkey Devonshire! It is super rich and cheesy (definitely not healthy) but it is delicious. Depending on when you decide to eat, expect to wait a bit. They have limited tables for groups.  Some drink deals: $4 beers  $5 mules $5 sangrias (white or red) from 5-7pm $10 bottles of wine (only a 1 cent markup)   Unfortunately, they no longer hand out their cocktail menu, but I remember there were a few really good ones. I'd ask your waiter or the bartender if you are interested in one! Come to Union Grill if you want to enjoy a comforting meal with good service, good food, and super cute decorations.",

I had heard about the 10 dollar bottles of wine, but I didn't really think too much of it before getting there. There were only 4 different options for the 10 dollar bottles, but honestly, who can complain at that price? There was also a really good menu of mules, and they were all only 5 dollars! There is a very diverse menu, so it's easy to find something that works for you. I had the blackened salmon dinner, and wow! It was so good. Definitely a bit spicy, but I enjoyed that about it so much. It came with waffle fries and green beans, and they were both very very good as well. The wait staff was so friendly, and even though the restaurant got busier as the night went on, we were always well taken care of throughout the night. I will definitely be returning!",

First time I went I had a burger which was one of the best burgers I've ever had and I really liked how there were a range of awesome toppings you can add for free, including bacon, avocado, mushrooms, brie, etc.  The second time I went I had their grilled cheese special which I hope they keep on the permanent menu since it was the best grilled cheese I ever had.  Similar to the burgers they give you many options to choose from at no extra charge.  I choose Brie, bacon, mushroom, and spinach and it was so delicious.  The Brie came out melted perfectly which is hard to do just right with Brie and the bacon was thick and crisp.  It comes with a variety of choices for side items and I chose the \"field greens garnish\" which was way more than a garnish, and was in fact a decent sized salad taking up half the plate!  When I had the burger the first time I chose the waffle fries which were crispy and delicious but waaaay too much food.  I also got a cup of the gumbo soup as an appetizer (in retrospect an appetizer definitely was not needed..) which was delicious and had a good spice to it, but as a native from New Orleans I can say it wasn't traditional gumbo (sauce was way too thin and it had tomatoes and corn in it which are not traditional in Cajun New Orleans style gumbo).  Maybe I'm a gumbo snob but considering that gumbo originated in New Orleans I kind of feel that if you are going to call it gumbo (vs chicken soup) you have to stick to some of the traditional key features of gumbo.  Also great cozy atmosphere.  I wish the lighting were a little better since sometimes I like to come at my lunch break and bring some articles to read.  In the warmer months they have outdoor seating which is really nice.  Service is usually good but it can get busy at times and then servers may be less attentive.",

I suppose it's one of the classier places on Craig Street, a place where college students would get their takeout fix at neighboring restaurants like Maximum Flavor, Little Asia, Orient Express, and Lulu's Noodles.  As a CMU student myself whose lab was on Craig Street, I can certainly attest that going to Union Grill for a beer and a meal was a treat. I never made it out to their wine night specials but it seems worth checking out.",

    "text": "Went for lunch, after reading good reviews.  I ordered a fish taco, which was supposed to be good according to what i had read on yelp and urban.  Our food came out, after about 30 min.  Apparently, when they say fried fish with avocado, they meant a whole fillet of oily, battered (not-crisp) fish with a whole avocado sliced into thick strips and crammed into a 12 inch tortilla shell on a bed of fries.  It was absolutely disgusting.  The price per the amount of food was absurd, which begged me to assume the quality of the ingredients must be low.  I'm talking about two to three meals worth of food.  Best part of the meal though was after we finished eating we find ourselves unable to find our server.  We had seen her step outside a few minutes prior and we just assumed she had come back or would come back, so we wait. Ten. fifteen. twenty minutes.  Finally we just assumed we would never see her again and we went to the bar and asked the bartender to access our check.  We paid and left - never to return.",

    "text": "We just recently rediscovered this spot. Huge portions and good prices. We have found the service to be excellent and welcoming. In the last two months alone we have tried the awesome fish sandwich, the crab cakes (very good), a huge and satisfying avocado-topped burger, a solid reuben, several servings of addictive pierogie appetizers and  the french dip (the sauce is the phenomenal, which made up for the slight dryness of the meat that night).  What kept us coming back? One thing. The penny-over-cost Belgian bottle selection!!! When we stumbled in here a few months back for dinner, I was already aware of their $10 bottle of wine special, but it wasn't something I had ever taken advantage of. Our rockstar server suggested we try one of their Belgian big bottle choices, which are priced at just a penny over cost for anyone purchasing a meal. We got the Ommegang Three Philosophers that night. Oh my Lord! So good. We like to bring our own fancy bottles of beer to BYOB shops, but this new perk at Union allowed us to drop in whenever, without a bottle, and sometimes end up paying less for a top-notch sipping beer than we would anywhere else. Wine specials are nice, but this big bottle special is the first I have ever heard of and seemed like a really food-progressive move given the increasing sophistication and popularity of craft beers in Pittsburgh (and everywhere for that matter).  Sadly, we visited Union about two weeks ago and heard they cancelled this Belgian bottle special. Noooo! I hope they reconsider. I'm sure we'll pop in again regardless, but not with the same regularity. And once again, big bottles or not, quality food, good prices, great service.",

On trip #1 I had the fish sandwich, which was certainly hearty.  2 large pieces of fish (cod? perch?) deep-fried on a bun with tartar sauce and waffle fries on the side.  The sandwich was filling and tasty, if a bit bland.  On trip #2 I had a cup of the chicken and sausage gumbo (very good) and the Pittsburgh-style chicken salad with the house dressing (a garlic vinaigrette).  The salad was large, and the standouts were the sauteed mushrooms and onions, as well as the waffle fries (which I could probably eat for days).  The chicken was bland and a little bit dry.  There are plenty of other items on the menu that I want to try (including the Turkey Devonshire) so I will surely return.  The location is super convenient to CMU and Pitt, and drink specials look promising (although I haven't actually tried the Union Grill for drinks).",

Despite Tessaro's claiming the best burger in Pittsburgh, Union Grill's Artisanal Cheeseburger is my favorite, especially when the cheese that month is Swiss Gruyere. The steakburger base handily trumps the crumbly patty at Tessaro's. While \"the local\" has toppings that sound good, I found it disappointing and have since ordered the Artisanal another half dozen times.   On days when I didn't need any more beef, I've tried the fish sandwich and the fish taco, both which use a huge fish n' chips style fried filet overflowing whatever piece of carbs it happens to be between. They are a good value, but don't match the awesomeness of the Artisanal. Union Grill also has a rotating tap, reasonably priced, and if you ever see Anderson Valley Summer Solstice, it is a must drink.  Once I even left my credit card here and they didn't mind me stopping by after they closed to pick it up. Nowadays, anytime I suggest a restaurant other than Union Grill to my Iranian friend, he has to ask, \"but is it honest, American, food?\" To which I reply, \"havercrafte man pore mrmhi ast.\"",

As it was known for its burgers I decided to give the UG blue burger a try.  This was a burger with a healthy does of blue cheese on top.  They had several burgers to choose from including the artisanal UG burger that had different artisanal cheeses every day to try on your burger.  A  Gouda was the cheese available when I was there, but I still went for the blue cheese.  The burger itself was actually some type of steak burger.  I am not sure what exactly the ratio they used for it, but it was a little lean for my liking.  The blue cheese they used was delicious and with the lettuce and onion it made for an overall nice burger.  They definitely could improve on the meat.  For my side, I picked the waffle fries which got good reviews.  They were pretty good, but nothing spectacular.  They remind me of the waffle fries from Carl's Jr.  You don't get a lot of places that offer waffle fries, so I consider it a pretty good option.  The service was good.  The atmosphere was nice.  Overall the place was a good stop that I would recommend, but for a place that is considered one of the best burgers in Pittsburgh the meat paddy needed to be a bit better.",

We had a nice lunch at the bar, the bartender couldn't have been nicer- but I had a major issue with the woman they have as hostess.  She is a younger brunette with a bob and serious lack of social skills and customer service.  She turned people away, had to pry it out of her that you could order food at the bar.  When I asked her if we could see menus as we sat at the bar ( she was 5 ft from me putting menus back into the stack of 50 behind her) she said only the bartender could give them to us.  ( They are the same exact menus FYI). What really put me over the edge is how she stared at this 85 year old woman with a walker who made he way off the street in 85 degree temperature.  I got up to open the door for the woman as the hostess stared blankly at her like what the hell do you want.  This poor lady is getting her walker stuck on the carpet about to trip and the hostess was flat out cold dismissive toward her.  It's really a shame because I love the restaurant, and this particular woman and het attitude do not fit in with the character of the restaurant as a whole.",

    "text": "This place has great giant burgers, yummy, crispy criss cross fries, and one of the best butternut squash soups I've had.  Its the kind of place that you go to when you know you'll also be going to the gym later that day.  Even when I've gone and had the grilled salmon and veggies with fresh herbs over greens, I can't help but get the fries also because they're sooo good.  My husband always gets the fried fish tacos, which he really likes, and a pretty good side salad, which is an upcharge from the side of fries, potato, or sweet potato chips.",

    "text": "Union Grill serves one of the best burgers in Pittsburgh.  I ALWAYS get the \"Chophouse.\"  You get to choose from a large selection of topping... for example I got swiss cheese and avocado (guacamole) yesterday.  It comes with your choice of sides... I got waffle fries.  SO delicious and I think very reasonably priced for the quality.",

    "text": "I walked over here from the Carnegie because their cafe closed early or something.  Anyhow, I followed the advice on here.  I stayed away from the seafood everyone dislikes, and ordered the Artisanal cheeseburger and waffle fries.  The burger was very good; the waffle fries were waffle fries (please - no one has ever been to a Chik-Fil-A? Ore-Ida also makes a frozen version that should be available at your local supermarket).   It was expensive, $11.99 for the burger and fries.  The menu seemed to indicate that this had something to do with $10 bottles of wine.  So maybe if you drink wine the price is right?  All I know is their draft prices ($5) seem a tad on the high side too.",

Portions and drinks are on the large side.  Desserts have good.   This is the only restaurant I have been to that has a *very* reasonably priced wine selection.  Decent wines (wine spectator rating on the menu) for less than $15.  One extra star for this feature alone.",
