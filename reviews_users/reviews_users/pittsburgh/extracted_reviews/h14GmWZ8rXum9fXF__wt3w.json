I was still waiting for my cesar salad. The chili was cold and the blt bread was so hard you couldnt bite into it. When we asked to speak to the manager the waitress got very defensive... the manager came over and explained that is their food and how its made so he wasnt sure of the problem. After an argument going back and forth ensued he agreed to comp the meals. Here is the kicker haha...we were going to leave the waitress a tip because clearly it was not her fault however, she came over and asked if our problem was resolved we said yes and then she rolled her eyes and walked away. No tip for you my friend. This is not how you do business especially when there are other options BESIDES SOHO to choose from for lunch.",

I might go back if I want some cheap appetizers and a beer during happy hour.  Seating outside was ok at best.",

They're really good for pickup.  As is a constant problem on the northshore, service is INCREDIBLY slow.  You won't get out of here in under an hour if you dine in.  The waitresses are just MIA with refills and bringing checks, and the food takes a while to come out too.  But if you have time to spend, it's probably the best lunch spot on the north shore.

The menu is large so I doubt much is all that fresh but SoHo serves standard bar appetizers as well as decent sandwiches and average burgers, plus even some entrees which generally seeem to be quite good.  They also offer a whole bunch of sides with your sandwich & burger rather than just automatically getting fries - gotta love the tater tots and even the mashed sweet potatoes are pretty good.  If you're in the area for a game or any reason, SoHo is a nice upscale option for food or a drink - and there are plenty of TV's for watching sports.  It's a good place to hang out.",

That's just what it is - a hotel bar. Good drink selection, diverse menu options. The restaurant was pretty empty (I blame the cold, snowy late Monday again) but nice to be able to converse and relax after traveling.   The Honey Barbecue Pulled Chicken was on the specials, and MAN was it special.  I would return for that sandwich if I were in town again and they added it to their regular menu. The flavor was great without being too spicy, but it certainly wasn't bland either. Hands down, one of the best pulled-meat sandwiches I have ever eaten.  Overall, it was a good hotel bar. If we weren't staying upstairs we probably wouldn't have eaten there, but I am glad we did.",

I ordered the chicken parm pasta and got it to go to my room. The pasta looked and tasted like it was days old and soggy, the chicken was overdone (dry), and the tiny (super tiny) roll was dry and stale. Very bad food and overpriced. Not only was the food a huge disappointment but the bartender who took my order was unfriendly and not helpful. She then began to pour beer from the tap into a glass and sprayed beer on me and didn't say a word, though I met eye contact with her as soon as it happened. She was more interested in talking with the other waitresses.......you know she got a great tip :)  Try another place for food even if you have to step outside of the hotel, there are a bunch of places to eat across the street and at the baseball stadium that is right next to the hotel....Atrias was pretty good and very nice wait staff.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.atrias.com%2F&s=a835551137603b4088d80db436e26bad966abc87b09080af73e99d63e1141a57\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">atrias.com</a>",

    "text": "This place is awesome.   Tasty! Chicken cob salad is green, healthy, and very delicious. Any kind of salad is provided with a variety of sauces you can choose and my choice was  blue cheese. It was good. + Chips and soup. I can't remember the exact name of it but it's cool. It was tomato soup with some cheese and you can find it on the top line of soup section of menu.   Cool! In the middle of the floor there is a great bar. You can enjoy cocktail during even daytime. Mine was beautiful combination of strawberry, perrier and vodka. Again, I forgot .   Sweet! All of the clerks were so kind. They kept asking me if I need something more in very gentle manner at the right time.  Thanks to their fine manners, from when I arrived and was assured by the waitress to when I payed my bill, I felt comfortable even though I was alone all the time there.",

    "text": "Soho is right by my office, so I find myself there occasionally. Typically more than intended, and especially when we need a more neutral lunch spot. That sounds cruel, but it simply is what it is: a hotel restaurant & bar.  In the category of hotel restaurants, the selection is wide and diverse, and the quality is certainly better than others. However the price is definitely marked up for the audience (hotel guests have to eat somewhere, right?), and I have experienced issues with consistency.  Faults aside, the locale is convenient, and I do appreciate their diverse selection (some fusion-inspired items, vegetarian options, fun sides, etc.). Make sure to check the back of the menu for the weekly specials. Each week the chef(s) will come up with 5ish unique items. These are certainly the gems of the menu, and often contain ingredients not found in the standard menu.",

Tonight I had two well martinis a glass of mundane meritage buffalo perogies ( don't bother) and a margarita pizza with spinach and Italian sausage.  The bill was $70.  Good Holley begeezes.  The martinis are well made, but well drinks at $12?  The buffalo perogies just were blech I thought I'd be special here in Pittsburgh but no.  The pizza came out with most the spinach in one piled in one slice, not very much sausage for a $2 extra, and that was not distributed well either.  All in all, for spending $70, before tip, for mediocre food from an unimaginative and poorly performing kitchen, just not worth it.",

And even though our server took forever to bring the food,  check,  or even refill our drinks we still had a good time on our precious lunch venture. It was totally different experience than my Monday experience (when the place wasn't busy). Monday the server (different person) was attentive,  quicks and he at least handed everyone their check instead of handing all the checks to one person. As someone that recognizes great service,  today was not an example of such things. I will say though that they're buffalo chicken is the right amount of spice. Next time I go I will eat at the bar in hopes it doesn't take a decade (exaggeration) to get my food. I'm really interested in trying their cocktails. Their prices aren't that expensive. I got a wrap and fries for ten bucks (win)! If you're looking to eat something and can't find anything good on their menu,  you should just stay home. I really hope the third time makes up for the second and then I can form a solid opinion on Soho.",

I work across the street from here so it is convenient to order from but not necessarily a place I would have normally eaten on my off day. My coworker came back to the office and said that they have a brand new menu so I decided to check it out. I was pleasantly surprised. The menu options all looked tasty. I went with a turkey burger. I normally would have ordered there spicy turkey burger in the past but this was no longer an option. I asked the bartender if I could get there mushroom Swiss burger, but with a turkey burger and make it spicy. She said no problem. When I got back to my desk I opened my to go box and it looked very good visually. It also tastes excellent. Perfectly cooked. Not too dry (like some turkey burgers can turn out) and not undercooked. It also came with fries that were perfectly crispy. So glad I decided to try their new menu. I had my eye on some other menu options for future trips. It's worth the prices now in my opinion. More so than their immediate competitions on the same block.",

Fast forward and my job sends me to work in Pittsburgh, beautiful city and staying next to this sort of expensive restaurant.  Appetizers- Pretzels sticks. I was expecting some light bland bs, so I asked for mustard to have with it in advance.  Turns out they were soft chewy and the best pretzels I ever had. The mustard was the icing on the cake. If you like cheese, well then it comes with warm cheese. Cheese ain't my cup of tea. Main dinner 1st time was a chicken club, it was good, no complaints.  2nd time - the waitress had the pretzel sticks already being made for my party of four. Wife Right there. We ordered more sticks. This time I had an Asian chicken salad. It was Aweeeesome. I don't really like dressing. So I mixed it with pretzel sticks and light mustard.   My party loved their food (Soho Samplers)as well. The pretzels were our weapon of choice against hunger after hard work.  As for my cup of tea I had at the end, it soothed my senses after eating ferociously.  Point blank I miss this place, and the waitress.",

But I really don't think there's much you can mess up. The buffalo pierogies however, was a total miss.   I do not want to make any accusations, but they did not seem to be freshly made, maybe frozen pre-made ones. And they were covered in hot sauce. It didn't look appetizing, nor did it actually taste appetizing.   They have half off appetizer specials for food and $5 drinks. But all the special drinks were mixed, and I knew they would probably be way too sweet and frou frou for me.   I went with a glass of Malbec, which was a good choice. Actually, it was the best choice there. Maybe stick to beer or wine and you'll be good to go here.",

    "text": "I went to Soho for the first time with four other friends. The restaurant was by no means full but we left unimpressed by our experience.  Several things: 1. Our server accidentally dropped tartar sauce on my friend and I's clothing and on the floor between us. He apologized for the accident several times and offered to pay for dry cleaning my friend's shorts which my friend declined. I did not realize until later it was on my jacket as well. 2. My quesadilla came out with chicken when I asked for cheese only, the server even had clarified that I wanted just cheese. A new one was made. He said the kitchen had accidentally added the chicken. It took about 15 more minutes and my friends were almost done with their meal when I got mine. 3. Our server accidentally dropped something beside me on the floor that ended up splashing something in my eye. He didn't realize. 4. He came back to tell my friend and I that because of the mishaps, we would get dessert on the house. However neither of us wanted them due to dietary restrictions and nothing else was offered. 5. It took nearly 20-25 minutes after that before he came back to give us our check.  6. He ran my friend's card for the wrong check and didn't realize until he gave out the checks back. Again apologizing and reassuring my friend his card would not be charged twice.  The whole night was almost 2.5 hours due to several of these reasons above. One or two of these incidences would not have been a problem but it just seemed like so many mishaps! The FOH manager never came to check on us after all of this. Although our server was nice, the experience left us all feeling like the customer service was lacking!  Additionally, I had emailed the manager the above experience and never heard anything!",

To top off our season of live experiences, we had one more Stage AE show to catch as well as stomachs to satiate beforehand according to protocol. I kept forgetting about a certain North Shore food-and-drink destination named Soho, so with them in mind, Kay, a mutual friend, and myself strolled on over after parking the car to see how they measured up.   The interiors invoke a noirish urban landscape not unlike Bruce Timm's vision of Batman's Gotham City or the city of Chester Gould's Dick Tracy with a sparsely detailed skyline acting as the focus of the dining room.  Swankiness be damned, our gracious and gifted server Jess treated us like Rat Packers despite our denim-and-band-shirt attire, serving us above average food with agility, style, and congeniality.   To kick off the meal, our power trio shared a serving of Soho's Thai Shrimp. On a bed of greens and lemon wedges came an octet of plump, reddened sweet/sour prawns that dazzled our palate with their Asiatic/Oceanic blend of sugar, sting, and brine.   Offering the proverbial \"a little of everything,\" Soho also crafts a fabulous Buffalo Chicken Pizza. It was a must, and in lust I fell, deeply...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DFnI36r9sdG4&s=e4cf88a6bf2a85fdaf5de51dd85d3f8c8839bca0b981f66bdee07e20f1adb637\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=FnI3...</a>  A puffy, doughy, floury, artisan-proud, stone-baked crust held moist cubes of chicken breast, a typically tart tabasco sauce, and a a gloriously glutinous blend of mozzarella and provolone. At 12 inches around, this was a magic carpet ride to pizza pie paradise.   The Caramel Turtle Bundt Cake was almost akin to a chocolate sticky bun with its adhesive, candied walnuts. A scoop of vanilla cream soothed the heat and richness of this igneous breakfast treat turned dark and inverted, lacerations of caramel amplifying the sweetness with slightly sinister salty bent.

Soho is one of the more popular choices because it is fairly close and has a wide variety of menu items.  The biggest issue is that it is hit or miss on all accounts.  There are times I've gone and service has been exceptional where we were easily in and out in an hour.  There were other times that it was time to walk back to the office and our food had not yet even arrived.  The food quality is the same way.  There are times that everything is perfect and tasty.  There are other times where everything in the order seems to be wrong and taste off.  One downside is the price.  For the type of restaurant it is, the prices seem a bit high.  That being said, it is a restaurant located in a hotel and next to a stadium, so I suppose they may feel justified in their higher prices.  Overall not bad, but it seems like it is better for drinks or appetizers rather then full meals or a quick lunch.  Especially if you are trying to get back to the office or out in time for a game.",

If you want a simple burger or wrap and fries, this place is what you'd like. Prices are really reasonable given the location. 2. Beer selection: nothing spectacular. Stella, Sam Admas, Yuengling, and some others. I suggest that you just have a cocktail instead. 3. Ambiance: Great before a Pirates game. Loud and fun, but not as crazy as some of he bars across the street. You are here to have some fun -- not on a quiet, romantic date. 4. Interior design: Not much to brag about. The restaurant is part of a hotel and is rather bland.   It's a great place to come with friends and family before a Pirates or Steelers game. I imagine it's pretty dead and boring on other occasions.",

    "text": "Soho was disappointing. Lunch was very crowded, so we sat at the bar, even though there was an open table for 3 by the window. We were just 4, but they wouldn't let us put an extra seat at the open table. It was also very loud for a weekday, the noise from other tables carrying easily.  I ordered the french dip sandwich, with risotto on the side. To their credit, the risotto was delicious, but such a tiny portion, I inhaled it in no time. Especially considering the french dip was so boring. The meat and cheese was bland and the sauce had far too many herbs in it. Not to mention, the food is definitely over-priced. I don't think I'd go back, but if I did, I'd order the risotto and nothing else.",

The French onion soup had a little too much bread and not enough onions, but the tater tots were awesome (we ordered 3 bowls). This could be a great before/after pre-game spot. It was clean, good atmosphere, and a good spot to hang out with friends",

Major change from our visit a couple years ago!     Previous Review :  Stopped over before calling it a night after a Friday night Bucco game plus a few stops.  We were very pleased with the relaxing atmosphere.  Music was playing but not nearly loud enough to drown out our conversation.  Took a pizza with us back to the room.  It was good.   Nice stop when on the North Shore!",

In any case, I ate here twice during my recent visit to Pittsburgh. I had the Tuna the first time and sat outside, although I wished we had sat inside as the seating outside is limited, and I really don't care for people passing directly next to us on the street. The Tuna was excellent; this is a hard to find item as sushi grade. The second time on a game night I had the NY Strip. Also excellent. Good beer selection. The tip on game night is to get there early, NLT than five or so. Otherwise yes, you will be slammed. Service was great from the server, but the hostess not so much. The dining room wasn't close to full and she sat us at the tiniest two-seater table. Before I could say anything she was gone; I just moved us to a nicer table; there was no reason to seat us there. Again, maybe it's a game day thing. The hotel is connected to the Springhill Suites, and they deliver to both Springhill and the Residence down the street.",

Great place to watch a game, LCD screens everywhere.  Skip the other appetizers and start with the angry shrimp.  They do a really good job with a filet mignon.  The salmon picata looked yummy, but since it wasn't mine, I didn't get to taste it.  If you don't want a big meal, they have all the usual sandwiches and burgers.  For dessert, have the banana bread pudding or some yummy chocolate fudge cake!  Or, if you're not feeling fancy, just throw back a few beers and bacon cheddar burger.  It's that kind of place, too.",

    "text": "This is one of those classic scenarios where I'd like to give 3.5 stars... sigh...  Anyway, here's the skinny: SoHo is a great bar to watch games (as mentioned by the other reviewers), an OK place to eat, and the service is fantastic. If it were just based on drinks/service/viewing, I would give it a 4 or 5 stars rating. The food drags it down a bit.  I've been to SoHo about 20 times (as I frequently stay in the hotel above it), and they have a decent beer selection and a very good/knowledgable bar staff. The bar can get extremely packed on game days, as it is literally across the street from PNC Park (and a short walk from Heinz Field). On an off-night, though, it usually has a moderate crowd that trends toward the 30-something \"hip\" groups (it's not a college bar, nor a neighborhood pub).  As far as food, it's really hit-and-miss. Once I had Buffalo Chicken Pierogis, and they were awesome. I've also had a Tuna Steak Sandwich there that was great (if I remember correctly, it had some sort of chipotle or wasabi mustard on it that was yummy). However, as I ate there last night, I saw the lower end of the spectrum. I had a shrimp/scallops pasta dish (Diablo Pasta?), and it was not spicy at all (despite being advertised as such). It was just OK (the ingredients, other than the sauce, were pretty good, but the sauce was just passable). A friend of mine said that the French Onion soup was awful (way too much oregano, he said), and his \"sirloin\" sandwich was not sirloin. So I would just say it's either inconsistent, it has gone downhill, or there are just a few things that they do well.  The service, however, is fantastic. No matter how busy they are, the staff is very attentive and friendly (I've never had to wait long for a beer). I've also had quite a few drinks, over my visits, \"on the house\", which doesn't happen very often anywhere else. They also know a bunch of bartending \"tricks\" that they will do on request (like the Bailey's/Yager \"switching shot glasses\" one).  One last note is that it is usually pretty smoky in there, so be prepared to have your clothes reek after you leave (which, sadly, is the norm for Pittsburgh).  Bottom line: as a bar, 4.5-5 stars... as a restaurant, 3 stars.",

    "text": "My friend Catherine came in from Chicago to visit me for the weekend. After a morning at the Aviary, we stopped here for lunch before heading over to the Phipps Conservatory. I'd never tried this place before, so I wanted to stop in. Catherine was hungry--she said she could have eaten cardboard at that moment and it still would have tasted good!   Luckily, she didn't have to go that route and the food here was much better than cardboard!   We began our lunch by splitting an order of Angry Shrimp. Angry Shrimp is very spicy (as its name implies) and is served over chilled pasta. For my main course, the Apple Raspberry Salad sure was tempting, but my blood sugars were running high (I'm a type-1 diabetic) and I already had my carbs with the pasta. I wanted a burger as a second choice, but their burgers are 1/2 pound and I knew I couldn't finish one. Plus I didn't want to schlep leftovers on the bus. So I opted for a Chicken Cobb Wrap, which was tasty enough.   For the life of me, I can't remember what Catherine ordered, but she did remark that the food was good. She tried the Penn Pilsner beer, which she loved. I don't drink, but unsweetened brewed ice tea with a little lemon in it really hit the spot.   So the food here is good as is the service. But there doesn't seem to be anything that distinguishes this place from Chili's, Houlihan's, Mex & Erma's, etc. And I wish they'd offer 1/4 lb burgers. Still, it's a good place to go if you're visiting the nearby Aviary, Science Center, the Warhol, or if you're going to a Steeler's or Pirate's game.",

Service  was lousy- Molly didn't make eye contact, and acted like it was a pain to serve us. Food was crappy- we got potstickers and firecracker shrimp, kid got the chicken fingers.

I ended up using having to give up and used a knife and fork. As a note the mozzarella cheese is fresh buffalo mozzarella not the yellow cheapy stuff.

The first thing you notice walking in is The tacky decor. Is it a family restaurant? A sports bar? I don't think they know what they are. The bar seats are torn to shreds. I almost didn't want to sit down for fear of my dress snagging. The service was subpar. Everyone seemed more concerned with sitting at a little table in the corner or on their cell phones rather than waiting on their customers. The food was just gross. I got what was supposed to be a spicy pasta dish. It was bland Alfredo with overcooked shrimp and stale bread. Not worth $16. My friends had a wrap of some sort. It just looked gross. She took a couple of bites and just stopped. I asked to speak to a manager, none ever showed up. We tried to play spot the person in charge buy the only one we saw that MIGHT have been a manger was a fat, short guy with a ridiculously bad hair dying job. He looked mean. We decided we will not return. Ended up going to Local. Much, much better.",

The bartender was chillin with some friends or just plain ignoring me, not sure but either way I was not getting any service.  I finally flagged down another bartender and asked for my check, she said she would get my server.  I waited another 10 minutes or so and still nobody came to give me the check.  I flagged over the 2nd bartender again (she was the only one responding) and said should I just walk out on this tab to get the attention of the bartender?  After a lengthy wait I finally got my tab and paid but for whatever reason the lady serving at the bar just didn't want to work and now management gets to read this review and decide why they hire people that do not want to sell more product to willing paying customers.",

    "text": "So when I walked in to Soho last month for happy hour, a person in my party made a casual comment that this place never seems that busy when they walk by it. Little did we know that our group would discover exactly why this is the case during our visit. It's especially noteworthy that I came with a large group that made a reservation with specific instructions about what we wanted. Our evening plans had been made well in advance, and Soho knew - or should have known - exactly how many people would be in our party, and when we would arrive. Most of all, they should have known we had not only asked for a table to be ready, we had asked for water and very specific appetizers to be ready for our group, as we would be hungry after the event we enjoyed before the happy hour.   Well, as you can probably guess from my rating, making a reservation and discussing and confirming our needs with the staff well in advance made absolutely no difference in the quality of our visit. In fact, I can summarize my entire visit here in two words: we waited.  We waited for them to confirm we had a table after we walked in at 7:15. We waited for the sever to come after they finally confirmed that yes, a reservation had been made. We waited for the server yet again after asking for drink menus. We waited for these drinks, and for water. And we waited for our pre-ordered appetizers.   Absolutely nothing arrived in a timely manner. In the 35 minutes that I waited with the group, all I got was a water. None of the pre-ordered appetizers even arrived while I was there, and many people waited 10 to 15 minutes for their other drinks. I was honestly astounded at how much the staff missed the mark with our reservations and requests. So I gave up, and left at 7:50 to find a better venue that was interested in providing me with a relaxing Friday night meal.  And all of that was on a night where the place was mostly empty! I can't even imagine what the service must be like if it's actually busy - and I certainly won't be back to find out!",

It's decor is more upscale, but it has TVs spread throughout which counteract the nice atmosphere.  If you are looking for an upscale bar, then this is your place. It's more expensive than most of North Shore and for grabbing a beer before the Steelers or Pirates game, there are better/cheaper options.

It's a big sports bar with pretty generic decor but it feels light and open and the screens are hung high enough that they don't distract you if you don't want to watch them. The waitress was friendly and service was efficient. Soho has a good range of craft type beers including some locally brewed ones on tap and the food was pretty good overall. It's bar food so it's not going to be the most gourmet thing you ever ate but the gyro plate that I ordered hit the spot. The fries were hot and crispy, the pita bread was soft and fluffy and stuffed full of gyro meat which was very tasty, if a little salty. The salad part of the dish was kind of lackluster but all in all it was a good plate of food for the price.  Soho is more of a three and a half star place rather than a four star (I'd give it 7 out of 10) but if you want a quick bite to eat in this area it's a pretty good option that won't break the bank!",

Just for a fish sandwich, I paid $13 and it wasn't any different than one I could have gotten for half the price or at any of the actual sports bars in the area.

Best part of the whole night was the bartender. Bobby was FANTASTIC! If I lived in Pittsburgh I'm pretty sure we would be friends. Keep her around! Up your food game and you have a winner! We came for a quick dinner and wound up staying way longer just for the bartender! If this review would be solely based on the service I would give 10 stars. It was amazing. I've been a bartender for close to 20 years and this lady rocked it out. At the end of the day I would come back here day after day for food that I would say was higher than sub par and service that couldn't be matched! Good on you Bobby!",

The West Coast Burger was surprisingly good and cooked perfectly medium rare. Boyfriend had the meatball sub special which was humongous!  Close proximity to the surrounding hotels which made it a solid place to grab a drink and watch some sports. Would recommend!",

My colleague had their burget and fries and seemed to enjoy it.  Followed by another 'dinner' with another couple of coworkers who arrived later and I met them since they wanted to get through some work to prepare for our meeting the next day. Waiter was funny and the vibe was good. We left right before the second rush (post game crowd) came in.  Overall nice place, especially for going there twice in a night!",

After last night, I'll never go back.  With several tables open, I had 10 people ready to sit at a large table by the bar (which are usually first come first serve since it's a bar table).  The hostess (who also said she was the manager) informed me that there was a multi hour wait.  There was nobody outside waiting and nobody inside around me waiting.  After arguing with me for several minutes when I informed her that I had 10 people ready to spend hundreds of dollars on food and drinks she told me, \"That's not how the world works.\"  So we went across the road and got drinks and food, then watched the fireworks.  During that time, I never saw a group walk in for the table we wanted to sit at.  There are too many other choices close by.",

Once seated, we waited so long to put in our drink orders that we were all able to decide on entrees. We ordered everything at once. Everyone got there drinks, except for me. I had to ask for my beer, in a bottle, the easiest drink of our order on three separate occasions. It finally came out, after all of our food did.   Portions were small. Several of my friends had the cheesesteak, which had way more bread than filling. I ordered the Old Bay Wings. Small portion as well when you consider they were about $14.  Our server was incredibly frazzled by the crowd and accused one of our coworkers of walking out on her tab. Turns out she had left her card, went to take a phone call, was gone for about 10 minutes and assumed that when she came back that her card had been run since it was still on the table. She left a cash tip and then went back outside to finish her phone call. It was an honest mistake on her part and 6 of us were still sitting at the table.  Between the crowd, the music and the TVs, it was so loud that I couldn't hear the people sitting on either side of me talk.  Will definitely not be back even if I stay at the hotel again.",

They have a decent sized menu / drink selection and an upper class interior/ dining experience. My order was just enough food to satisfy me without feeling uncomfortably full. The tater tots were delightful, but their seasoned fries are good as well! My only complaint is how difficult it can be to hold a conversation. There's a loud, bar atmosphere (especially before a Bucs game), so you have to yell to be able to hear anything. I feel as if things are more relaxed on non game days. Either way, I had a good time and I give SoHo my stamp of approval!",

Instead of looking for a place to go I got lazy and popped into SoHo (which was located right in the hotel I was straying at) to order some dinner before taking it back to my room. The staff was super friendly and the menu had a decent amount to offer. It didn't take me long to pick something as the special pork belly burger immediately caught the eye of both me and my stomach. The food was made super fast and they even gave me a refill of my ginger ale before I left. When I got back to my room and finally dug in, I was in a pork belly burger heaven. The pork belly was absolutely delicious and actually made my mouth water. The mashed potatoes that the burger was served with were pretty darn good as well.   Overall, SoHo did me right and I have no complaints at all. I loved my pork belly burger, the staff was friendly, and the restaurant itself was super nice as well. If you need somewhere to eat downtown, I would totally recommend SoHo!",

We order 4 plates and insist that we like our temperatures very high. First dish comes out cold (nachos). They forgot the guac we paid extra for. We send it back saying that it is too cold and to please microwave or throw in the oven. It gets served to us at an appropriate temp. No black beans or anything. Gross cheeses and chemical tasting tomatoes. We asked for guac again. It finally comes and when it arrives, it is chemical flavored and harsh tasting puree. Artichoke dip needs salt and pepper.

The manager on duty did apologize, but that was it. There was no offer of a comp or anything and she basically turned around and went on about her business despite us pointing out to her that there was water on the floor that caused the fall. Fortunately no one was seriously injured, but I really don't think that the staff handled the situation with any sort of intelligence or empathy. The place was noisy and it was pricey.",

It was okay- 6 nice sized shrimp served in a martini glass with cocktail sauce and 2 lemon.  Not bad, the shrimp could have been a little colder.  For dinner Kev had the buffalo chicken wrap with onion rings and I had the cobb salad with a side of balsamic vin.  I like the cobb- avocado, chicken, pieces of bacon, toms, egg, lettuce.  It is good but nothing special.  Our server was nice.....  The food here is just very blah.  The atmosphere is good to watch a game.    That $25 coupon didn't get us very far.  We ended up paying $54 with tip and with the coupon!  I guess our bill didn't add up to what we needed it to be to get the full bang for our buck?  Still confused.......  So-so is nothing special.

Probably an over-crowded zoo on Steeler game days, and probably crowded before / after Pirates games. Quiet but not dead on this night.  Normally a sports bar would get 3 stars from me just for having good (but not great) draft beer selection, lots of HDTV's playing all available games, decent (but not exceptional) food, good service, and a space that is clean. What set this place apart for me was two things...1) the space is pretty nice, a modern upscale sports bar, and 2) they offer a \"prime rib burger\" for a $2 upcharge which was exceptionally good. Dare I mention a candidate for \"best burger\" in Pittsburgh? Yeah, I would say so. For sure.",

And then you start to think, \"Hey, maybe that was better than ok, since I'm still thinking about it...\"  It's kind of like a movie that you're luke warm on, until you realize that you're still thinking about the movie two days later, and then you're like, \"Actually, I guess the movie was better than I thought, because I'm still thinking about it two days later.\"     Yeah, this place is kind of like that.  We went there back in October.  We had just driven about 6 hours from Jersey to Pittsburgh, we got in kind of late and hungry, and decided to get something to eat here because it was so close to our hotel (and I did not want to get back in the car and drive somewhere.)   They had a good drink special (a couple of dollars for a margarita), and we got sandwiches and burgers.  Nothing amazing, but they hit the spot.  But, here's the part I'm still thinking about... they had a special that included the option of sweet potato tater tots.   Sweet Potato... Tater Tots.  Is that redundant?  Should it be Sweet Tater Tots?  I don't know, but I do know they were willing to substitute them with my sandwich even though I wasn't getting the special.  And I do know they were goood.    So, now I'm a 6 hour drive away, it's two months later, and I'm still thinking about those Sweet Potato Tater Tots.  And, for that, I'm giving this place 4 stars.    SoHo is really close to PNC Park, and not too far from Heinz Field.  They also deliver (\"room service\") to the two hotels right there, Spring Hill Suites and Residence Inn.  Ask for the sweet potato tater tots.  As for me, I'm left wondering if sweet potato french fries (the more common menu cousin of the Sweet Potato Tater Tot) can ever truly be an adequate substitute, or if I need to go out and buy myself some sweet potatoes and try to tot them myself...",

    "text": "Hotel restaurant/bars are usually not known for being the best in town.  So when I had the opportunity to eat and drink at SoHo recently, I can not say I was surprised that I found the cuisine to be on the uninspiring side.  Is it terrible?  No,  but you know that better is out there.    The blackened chicken wrap was boring.  The flavor was missing and the entire meal was just bland.  Also, white tortillas just do not do it for me.  Why does it seem that Pittsburgh wants to thrive on fatty, flavorless food?  Upon ordering the caesar salad on New Year's Eve, I was told that the restaurant has no non- or low-fat dressing option...at all.  However, I can order a salad with FRENCH FRIES on it.  Seriously?  The salad was fine, by the way, and is a large portion but knowing  that tons of calories had to be consumed just to get a vegetable in me was disappointing.  On the bright side, the smoked turkey wrap, which comes with havarti cheese and cranberry sauce was ridiculously good.  The turkey was juicy and melded perfectly with the cheese and cranberries.  That I could eat again and it would  fill me up all day.  I also sampled the buffalo pierogies and really just found them to be the Mrs. T's ones with Frank's Hot Sauce on them.  They were good, but uncreative considering the price ($8.99).  The drinks here are decently priced and pretty good.  Friends I was with sampled a few of the drinks on the interesting cocktail menu and were happy with their choices...they were strong drinks.  When my co-worker and I arrived though one night to dine here, we were not offered cocktail menus so I just stuck with wine until I was no longer in the mood for a cocktail.    Service on New Year's Eve was apathetic.  Granted, the place was packed, but we had  to wait for silverware and had our food and drinks pretty much thrown at us.  Even when it slowed down we were barely paid attention to and were hardly treated with any amount of friendliness even though numerous drinks and food orders were made.  There are a ton of TVs here, so it is a great spot to watch a game.  Even during busy times, there is a space for you but it will take a while to flag down a server to seat you if you want to sit.    I think I would stop back here if I find myself at the Springhill Suites again, but I definitely would not go out of my way to dine here.  Can't win 'em all, right?    Pro-tip:  You can not access the restaurant from the hotel it is attached to (Springhill Suites) without a key and you can not leave the restaurant to get into the hotel without one.  Want some good people watching?  Sit and watch people try to get from one to the other without realizing you need a key.  Ridiculous.  Since you can access each of these places without a key from other doors, this does not make any sense.  But, it is what it is so do not forget your key!",

The blackening was not very spicy, but added salt and crunch to the outside of the tuna. The tuna was cooked to medium rare as requested (closer to medium, but still good). The issue was that the blackening did not add much flavor to the fish. The risotto was not creamy like a good risotto and looked like slightly dried out risotto drowned in Parmesan cheese. The food was okay and the portions were huge, but not highly memorable for me.",

The restaurant only had about two other customers so we had the dining room to ourselves. The vibe was chill and our server was awesome. He took his time with us and put extra detail into accommodating my little munchkin.  I ordered the Pittsburgher Chicken Salad which was decent, nothing to write home about. My significant other ordered the Meatloaf feature. His food looked so dry and inedible. He's not the type to complain about his food to the server, but I am. So the server took the food away after he tasted the horrible looking good and encouraged him to order something different. So he ordered the fish sandwich. It was pretty decent however you could tell it was just frozen fish. Are my expectations to high? How hard could it be to dip a piece of fish in some batter and fry it. I was disappointed with the lack of freshness. The chicken breasts in my salad were square mechanically processed strips too.  Well, I don't see a reason to go back there. Unless, I had the same server, because he was refreshing. Service isn't what it used to be. Needless to say, it was \"aite\", nothing amazing.",

The restaurant is located across from PNC Park in just about the least artsy-fartsy neighborhood of Pittsburgh. But I guess Post-Game Drunken Fratboy Hangout doesn't really have a good ring to it.  Is it a nod to Pittsburgh's very own SoHo? Lord, I hope not. The restaurant has far more glam than the rundown neighborhood trapped between Duquesne University and South Oakland. But I guess Depressing Shithole doesn't have a good ring to it, either.  Whatever the story behind its namesake is a moot point upon experiencing the restaurant's fare. Here's what you can expect:  1. Meh food. The SoHo steak and cheese is essentially chopped steak and Cheez Whiz on a bun. It's not particularly delicious. The fries were good, though.  2. Outstanding drinks. Perfectly priced, elegantly presented, and expertly mixed. The Cinnamon Toast Crunch martini is ridiculously delicious. Honest to God, it tastes like a friggin' bowl of the cereal. Except with alcohol.  If you're in the North Side, go for a cocktail during Happy Hour, but don't schlep out for a special trip or for a memorable meal. You won't find it here.",

Had the shrimp-crab bisque to start, which was easily the best thing I had that night. Then did a French dip sandwich for dinner, as there wasn't many \"dinner\" choices that intrigued me, and also the precious reviews of dinner dishes weren't good. Sandwich wasn't very good, typical bar cuisine though. Girlfriend had the chicken broccoli pasta, which was excessively cheesy.   Overall, it's not bad, but won't knock your socks off. It certainly benefits by the lack of other restaurants near it.",

    "text": "Ate here twice in one day. Once for lunch and again for dinner. Staying at the hotel and the dining locations nearby, according to Yelp, were less than desirable unless you head across the river to the restaurants there which were rated much better. Didn't feel like doing that so I ate at the hotel restaurant.   I had a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich for lunch that was just ok. Not recommended since there are so many more items on the menu to choose from. Not sure why this simple dish wasn't better -- you'd think a restaurant in PA would know how to make a decent cheese steak sandwich.   Had a local seasonal brew that was interesting but wasn't good enough to order two so I followed it with a Blue Moon which is always good.   For dinner I had some chili which again was good but not great. They cover it in cheese like a French Onion soup which was interesting but the chili itself could have been a lot better.   I also had a chicken quesadilla which is in the appetizers list but was very good as a dinner item. I'd have that again. Big chunks of chicken and tasty.   I stuck with Blue Moon for a dinner beer but did get to try another local brew that was really bad. Don't remember the name but I'm glad they let me try it before ordering because I would have hated choking that one down.   Service at the bar was very good and friendly -- it's a huge bar and usually had two attentive bartenders behind it. Would go back just to hang out and have beers there.  If this were a \"normal\" restaurant, I'd give it only three stars due to the food. But since it's a hotel restaurant, I'll give it four stars, especially when compared to what's nearby. I went into a local bar near the hotel and was ignored until I begged for a draft beer that was served in a plastic cup. There were tons of glass mugs nearby and when I asked for a glass, my beer got colder because of the bartender's cold stare.",

Do they even have tables for 3?? 15 minutes later... he asked his manager and allowed us to sit there. Overall, its a close spot to PNC but given both experiences, wouldnt return.",

Probably is a better bar than it is a restaurant.  The menu has a wide variety of good looking choices.  I simply got a Grilled Chicken sandwich with Swiss cheese and roasted red peppers and mashed potatoes.  It was ok.  The chicken didn't have much flavor to it and it was very thin breast that didn't fit all on the bun.  The mashed potatoes and gravy also didn't have much flavor to it.  My Dad had a burger and he said that was good.  It also took quite awhile to get our food after we ordered, despite it not being busy.  Our waitress wasn't overly friendly.  She was good, but all business, no pleasantries.  If I am staying at this hotel again (not likely), I'll probably eat here if I don't feel like venturing out.  However, I'd probably go somewhere else downtown otherwise.  I wouldn't mind going to the bar sometime though.  It really is a nice looking bar with plenty of seating.",

    "text": "A number of the reviews here giving off the \"eh\" vibe? That's because Soho is a kind of \"eh\" place.  I visited for the first time yesterday evening. My boyfriend and I decided to stroll over the bridge to catch some Jazz Live in Katz Plaza (Roger Humphries - really good show) and then headed to North Shore for some grub. Now, I don't find any of the restaurants near PNC to be that good (see my Bettis Grill review) so I knew we weren't going to find anything spectacular. We settled on Soho because I'd never been there before and Atria's doesn't appeal to me.  I did like the open layout on the inside of the restaurant. Looks like a perfect place to catch a game. Finally - a halfway decent TV setup, Pittsburgh! The bar is ginormous and they seemed to have an extensive liquor and beer selection. The draft selection was lacking, but they did have quite a few choices in bottles, if that doesn't bother you. I did not check their wine list, but I know they do have one.  My boyfriend ordered a chicken stir fry and I got a cheddar burger. My first thought: \"These two things should never be on a menu together.\" He said the stir fry was so-so. Ingredients were spot on, but it was lacking any real flavor. Someone mentioned this place as being a runner for best burger in town - huh?? There are a number of places I would put before Soho's: Winghart's, Burgatory, even Olive Or Twist! My cheeseburger tasted like a frozen Bubba Burger from the grocery store (you know the ones ... ). It wasn't terrible perse, but it wasn't particularly good, either. It was just so-so. The cheddar cheese on it was not very appealing - it tasted like one of those individually wrapped Kraft slices. Onion rings were tasty, but I've rarely, if ever, had bad onion rings.  I would visit this place again if my focus were more so on watching a game and drinking than actually eating. Otherwise I say pass. In fact, skip into town over eating in the north shore at all.",
