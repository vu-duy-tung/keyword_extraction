The fountain machine was out of ice and when I alerted the woman working the register she told me just to get a drink and that it should be cold enough without needing ice. Horrible service and disgusting conditions! I'll never go back.",

Two big screen tv's to enjoy the games or news while you wait or eat.  Restroom was clean and had an open stall and stand up urinal, but with a locking door. I bought a huge XL pepperoni pie for under $14.00 tax included. We leave here Tuesday and will probably get another pie before we do. Also the pies come with a container of house made ranch dressing that was great for dipping the bones in. Try it, you will not be disappointed!",

Don't expect to be blown away...this isn't the best pizza in Pittsburgh (see Aiello's, Mercurio's, or Il Pizaiolo for that), but it still tastes good and is super convenient if you live in Shadyside. I would, however, recommend getting toppings on the pizza. For some reason the plain cheese pizza comes out pretty greasy. The hoagies are also solid. Definitely recommended. As far as pizza goes, you could do A LOT worse in this town.",

Crisis averted, I called the delivery guy back (I saw the caller ID on my phone, he tried me 4 times before giving up) and asked if he was still in the area and would he mind bringing back my pizza. In just 20 mins he showed up with my food. It took that long because he thought my original pizza had become too cold, so he went back and had them make me another. Amazing.  Their pizza has always been good, their delivery always quick even during busy times, and the prices have always been great. But after this epic show of awesome-sauce, they deserved to be yelped.  Are you hungry? Do you like pizza delivered to your door? Do you live in Pittsburgh? Stop reading yelp and call Pizza Palermo.",

Luckily, Pizza Palermo deliver until 1:45AM, so we were able to get an assortment of hoagies, calzones, pastas, and gyros without any trouble. Not a single person had a complaint about the taste, portion size, quality, or speed of delivery - pretty good when we ordered for 10 people.   I had the Italian calzone, and it was quite delicious - mega meaty, complimented by melty provolone and ricotta - but it was also quite greasy, and the grease was not well contained in the pizza box, resulting in grease-covered scrubs... minus one star for that, and for being about 1 dollar too expensive. Despite those sour points, I will undoubtedly order from there again - my coworkers wouldn't have it any other way.  PS- just remembered that I also have had an Italian Deluxe hoagie from these guys, and that would also be worth ordering again without hesitation - again, mega meaty and great complimentary flavors from the toppings. It's no Real McCoy, but seriously, nothing is, so this is the best thing out there post-1AM and close to the best any other time.",

I called the restaurant and they said they'd send him over. He took an extra 15 mins to arrive with an incomplete order, since I had also asked for extra plates and cutlery (which I generally forgo when ordering for myself). Driver showed me the receipt he had which was for an old order I placed weeks ago (it seems that they don't even check the details on new orders and simply use old orders you gave) and kept arguing about how they weren't wrong about the order even when I showed him my online receipt. Terrible service and I'm going to think twice about ordering again even though the pizza is decent.",

I usually freeze the breadsticks and then we pull them out if we want some as a quick side for a meal.   The pizza is typical delivery pizza. I actually feel like all of the pizza places that deliver around here have pretty much cloned pizza. It all is so similar. Every time we get food from here, it comes hot, and it usually takes about an hour for delivery. I just expect that, but sometimes it comes faster. It's like a bonus.   Their buffalo chicken stuff is really good. I love the hot sauce they use. It's not really a buffalo sauce, but it's a really good hot sauce and it's pretty hot. I thought it was just special for their hoagies, but it's what they use for the hot wings too. Definitely hotter than a typical hot wing. The hot sauce alone makes it worth ordering things from Palermo.",

The whole thing was soggy mass.  They were kind enough to send a large order of breadsticks they were fine.  I think I spent about $25 and I wouldn't have paid $4 for the whole thing.",

Service is slow, staff disorganized and after a very long wait, the employee walked out, I thanked him for the food and was met by silence and his back as he walked away after plopping this marginal at best Italian sub in the table.   So here is the scoop on the sub, baked roll with a small portion of meat (if you are charging me 8 bucks for half a sub...you may want to consider a bit more substance to it). The Italian dressing was right out of a bottle. Another thing I look for is some type of home made dressing for subs. It wouldn't kill these dudes to make a vinegar and oil based dressing with a few herbs.   I think this was a one time visit. I may have considered trying the pizza but acting like the customer is a pain, poor service and just rude employees isn't enough for me to buy your crap.",

He then stated that he cannot replace an online order. When I asked for a refund he became agitated and very rude.  He then said that he would only replace my marinara sauce with gyro sauce. I'm pretty sure that they should be responsible their online ordering system error. This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will never order from this place again.",

I would go back for the pizza, but not the cheese steak.  There are plenty of tables to enjoy lunch at, or dinner if you wanted, but I wouldn't really consider this a dine-in dinner location.  They do have delivery and take-out which are probably the primary business.  Catering options are available for large gatherings.",

I had the steak calzone and opted for having it in. First up, I know this is not a \"restaurant\", but would proper cutlery and proper plates be too much to ask for? The calzone itself was quite hard and I struggled cutting it with my little plastic knife. On top of that the paper plates were soaked through after 1 minute making me paranoid eating the plate too. The calzone itself tasted pretty bland, there was not much flavor to it and I basically drowned it in ketchup just because I was hungry and I paid $14 for it. And to call something a \"steak\" calzone when in reality you put in a couple of slices of what seemed to be dry roast beef slices, is just unacceptable. I am not really sure what their 'specialty' is as they must do something right reading all the other reviews. But, I don't think I will be back as there are many, many pizza places serving better food than Pizza Palermo.",

I said \"This is the first time I've called you this evening.\" I gave her my phone number and address and she said \"You have ordered before because I have all your information right here.\" I tried to explain to her that WE ORDER ALL THE TIME, but this was the first time I called Palermo tonight!! Then, instead of apologizing, she asked me if I was placing an order. I told her that I wasn't, that I would be leaving a review instead. Her name is Melissa and she should not be in customer service. I don't know who the person was who kept calling them tonight, but she confused me with them. It doesn't matter who they were either because she should not be talking to any customers that way, let alone me who called 1 time.",

Despite being quite expensive, they are absolutely obnoxious about charging for every little thing or making changes. I ordered spaghetti and wanted half white and half red sauce and got a call saying they \"couldn't do that.\" You mean you literally, physically cannot substitute half of the red sauce and add a little bit of white sauce? Really? She said would have to \"charge me for it.\" You would have to charge me extra for the same quantity of sauce? Why, because of all the extra exerted effort? Same thing for any sort of sauce for wings, breadsticks, whatever. And, yes. They charge $0.75 for a tiny cup of sauce.   I mean, if you want to pay $35 for a pizza dinner this is a good option. The hoagies are especially good. However, you can get much better for much cheaper elsewhere.",

While the food isn't bad, the delivery people never want to actually deliver the food to the apartment; they'll call from downstairs and ask you to meet them at their car in the street.  That's not delivery.  We order on line, so everything is paid in advance, including the driver's tip and the delivery fees.  It's not like they're going to get stiffed.  And street parking is readily available within reasonable proximity to our building, and is free after 6PM.  They call and argue that there's no place to park while I can see from our window that they're already parked while we're on the phone.  We called and spoke to a manager to complain about this and we were told it's their policy \"not to deliver upstairs, unless it's an emergency\".  I can't imagine what constitutes a pizza delivery emergency.    If I have to put on shoes and run out to the street to pick up the food, I'd just walk the extra block to their store.  I'm paying for a service, why not deliver?  Original Milano's (412-404-7530) is better, and they never have a problem delivering to our door.",

This first call was at 5:48, I called back at 6:57. This call was supposedly me speaking with the manager, the general mamager actually, and it was quite unpleasant. He told me that my order never existed at first, until I told him my order was done though grubhub. He then told me that my order was never started, and asked if I'd like to cancel or have it made now. I declined to have it made now as hesaid it would be another hour on top of my already 3 hour wait. I then asked this man for a corporate number and was given one. A random man answered and had no idea what I was talking about. This is the actions of a man who claimed to be a manager.

I called and ordered a delivery medium pizza one Saturday night and gave my card info to the person over the phone at about 1:30 am (they are open until 3 am). I was starving and had barely eaten that day. I got home and waited. They never gave me a time to expect the pizza because they hung up on me when I was trying to as by the way. So basically I waited until 2:30 am and the pizza still hadn't arrived so I decided to call to see what happened. When I called I reached an employee who was very short, rude and unhelpful, she told me that my phone number was not in their database and there were no orders for me on there screens and that there was nothing she could do about it. I hung up and looked on my card statement and there was already a charge from pizza palermo. So I decided to call back and I got the same rude person I talked to the first time. I explained there was already a charge on my card from them and asked if there was any information I could give to help them find my order, the employee said there was nothing she could Do. I asked if I could give my address and if that would help, she said no. I asked if she could Talk to someone else who could help, she said no. She ultimately ended up telling me that all I could do was dispute the charge on my card and she could not help me food wise at all. This is just one instance but if this is any reflection on their business as a whole then I'm sure their pizza is awful too. Don't eat here.",

Other places were closed, but Pizza Palermo was not. Plenty of workers churning out delicious pies.  3 of us got the XL Meat Pie and oh my lord was it amazing. I thought it was going to be one of those sad cheese pizzas but wow it was delicious. Super satisfying  Recommend: - Call ahead of time. We felt like newbies waiting while others called in their orders ahead of us. - They have sandwiches too. Pizza was delicious though.  - Limited Parking so park on the street.",

    "text": "1st: Pizza was cold. I called and was told, \"it's because it's cold outside.\" Huh? Okay, so note to self: never order pizza in the winter from here (for delivery) because there's no guarantee your pizza will be REMOTELY warm.   2nd: the pizza was burnt and they act as if they couldn't understand what I was stating. Soooo, I took the pizza back; although they did advise it would take 40-45mins, to get the new one. Why wait 40-45 mins to run the risk of cold pizza, again.   3rd: all of that for it to be subpar. It's been real!",

    "text": "Ordered large pepperoni pizza and wings. When I got home I noticed that there was no pepperoni. Wasn't too happy about but after calling the pizza. They said that they wouldn't deliver correct order since I live 20 min away. Manager Ali said that he can offer me double pepperoni next time. Lol what a joke. There will be no next time. Pizza was meh, wings were dry. But even worse that Customer service was bad. ;) Save yourself some time and buy your pizza from Slice on Broadway",

Supposed to be16 cut pepperoni pizza with two sides of their ranch dressing. Got no ranch and only 21 pieces of pepperoni on whole pie. Tasted like school cafeteria pizza. Too many shops in area to pay hood money gor bad food, paid 18.00 for bad pizza",

    "text": "This is one of the better pizza spots in Pittsburgh to order from.  Their menu is so extensive that I am fairly sure that any one person in the city would be able to find something that will put their hunger at bay.  I opted once for their fries with cheese and bacon on them.  This falls under their appetizers portion of the menu, but honestly it could be a menu item all on its own.  It is a healthy portion (that may sound oxymoronic) of fries.  You get to pick the cheese you want those fries to be smothered in and then crumbled bacon tops that off.  I almost always opt for the cheese sauce, that way I am guaranteed that the cheese makes its way to the bottom of the fries as well.  When I first ordered this item, I made the mistake of ordering another item on the menu and I should have just stuck with the fries.  They are more than enough.  I have had an array of items from the menu, but the fries are what stuck with me.  This may end up being my go to place when I can't decide what I want to snack on.  Staff are polite when you order, if you get delivery they are quite speedy.  One thing to know for delivery: $1 delivery fee.",

This is not only my late night (2 am) go to, but it is also my \"I don't feel like cooking tonight, let's order pizza\" joint.   We love the Buffalo Ranchero Chicken Pizza. If you order online, you also receive free breadsticks-how can you beat that deal?!   Ordering from the Center Ave location during the day/early evening is very quick; however, ordering late night can take a bit longer.   Whatever time you enjoy eating your pizza & breadsticks, I would highly enjoy ordering from Pizza Palermo! (P. S. Tell them they're number one customer recommended you ;-)",
