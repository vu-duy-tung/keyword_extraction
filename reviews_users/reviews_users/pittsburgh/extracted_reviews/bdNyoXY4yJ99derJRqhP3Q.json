For entrees, I had a french style dish of 3 different preparations of meats with mustards accompanying each of them. For dessert, we had a paw paw themed cake, which was excellent and the epitome of localized food.  Our wine took quite some time to come, and our server seemed rather unsure about certain items on the menu, and offered little explanation beyond what kind of water we would like to drink...  Was still a lovely experience!",

We ate the beef tartare and cauliflower soup since we weren't hungry but wanted a light snack for two with our drinks. I had the Daisy and the Cooler and I'd definitely recommend them to fans of gin and bourbon, respectively. The bar has some incredible wines and bourbons, as well as insanely rare amaros, for True aficionados. The service was absolutely incredible, the food, drink, and ambience were perfect. I will certainly be coming back as soon as humanly possible.",

I was literally at a loss for words for how good this was.  The second time, I got a duck dish where the dark meat was cooked to a *perfectly* juicy well-doneness, the skin was crispy, and the white meat was cooked to a medium, which is something I'm not used to with poultry but was absolutely delicious in this preparation.  Again, the sauces!!  Blew my mind.  My boyfriend has had the steak here and said it's the best steak he has ever had in Pittsburgh.

But it didn't blow me out of the water, either.  The menu was small with very limited choices. Even the wine by the glass list was short - and it wasn't great wine, either. I had two different types and they both tasted a bit like sour feet (yes, feet).  The gin from a friend's G&T was also pretty solidly mid to low level stuff.  I suppose throat for such high prices, plus the required reservation, I was expecting...more.   Service was great, seats were awesome, and the vibe was you do and fun. Maybe eat out here once in a while, but since I'm not from around here, I doubt I'll be back.",

From the staff, to the drinks, to the food, it was an experience we won't soon forget. The hand crafted cocktails were fantastic. I had a vodka daisy and my husband had an old pal. We shared the Nantucket Bay Scallop Crudo. This dish is served cold and the flavors just blend so perfectly!  I ordered the Pork Belly and my husband had the Hanger au Poivre. We kept sharing because both were so good we could not pick a favorite! The Pork Belly melted in my mouth. Both dishes had flavors that just complemented each ingredient so seamlessly. We wanted a glass of wine with our meal. We asked for a good pairing and what we were given was perfect!  We finished with the Dark Chocolate Souffle Cake. Again, it melted in my mouth. The pistachio butter was so decadent!  This was our first visit to Cure and we most certainly will return. What a fantastic restaurant with truly talented chefs and a suburb wait staff.",

Treat yourself to the meat and cheese platter and you won't regret it. Take your time and savor every bite. Seriously, these are not your grandmas sausages, these are artisan smoked and cured meats that will knock your socks off!   I had the pork tenderloin for my dinner entree and the dish was excellent, perfectly cooked and tender pork with excellent and interesting sides.   We decided to skip dessert and try out some of their amazing and unique cocktails. This turned out to be an excellent idea because their cocktails are almost as famous as their meats! We also ordered a sampler of the Aperitif and Digestif liquors, at the owners recommendation, which was a real treat. I highly recommend trying one of these or a sampler if you want to make the night more special.   You'll drop a ton of money but it's worth it if you truly appreciate good food, cocktails and atmosphere. Super casual but trendy feel and please, don't bring your vegetarian friends :)",

    "text": "Cure was on my to-do list for over a year before I finally made it. It seemed as though every time it was convenient for me to go, reservations were impossible to get. I was delighted to get one for my birthday this year roughly 24 hours ahead of time - luck was on my side. Spoiler alert: worth the wait.  I was being treated to my meal tonight, so we went all out. It gets expensive fast, but it's worth it to try a large array of food. My friend and I shared every dish that we ordered, so I think I got the full experience.  We started with the small salumi platter. If I can recall correctly, the duck speck really stood out. The sauces took it to the next level.   I don't recall everything that we ordered in between, honestly. I know we went with brussels sprouts which are my favorite vegetable (seriously, I eat probably 2 pounds a week) and even they were something special.   We ordered the hanger steak for the main course. The bearnaise stood out. The quality of the meat became more astonishing the more that we consumed.  It's worth mentioning that I follow a paleo diet - this place catered to my every need without me having to make substitutions. I hardly had to pick around any of my food besides a small serving of grains in one of the entrees. I rolled with the dairy because I was able to rest assured that it was from the best source.  The waitress delivered us the chocolate souffle cake at the end without us ordering it (hey, it was my birthday after all...) and I splurged despite my dietary restrictions. So very worth it. I'm not sure what went into this dessert, but it surpassed all of my chocolate-loving expectations.  Lastly, the cocktails! We thought about ordering a drink or two each, but we got so excited about our options and the taste that we left the restaurant quite buzzed. Not complaining - this meal was through and through a series of \"Oh my GOD\" and \"Wow\" exclamations between bites. It was the most euphoric and fun dining experience I've ever had.",

    "text": "Cure was my first experience at a bona fide fine dining restaurant. I wanted to take my ex-bf out for his birthday, and he was only available on Sun. evening.  I was planning to go to Legume, but they're closed on Sun.  Yelp's sidebar listed Cure as a related option, and upon seeing that the chef had spent time in Santa Cruz, CA (where I lived for several years), my mind was made up, so off to Lawrenceville we went!  Being unfamiliar with fine dining, the atmosphere of Cure was approachable for a first-timer.  I particularly appreciated the service that we received from our waiter, who was very good at explaining the various dishes and making recommendations. I ordered a salad as an appetizer (not sure which one, this was over a year ago), and the pike as my entree, per the waiter's recommendation.  For dessert, my ex and I ordered the dark chocolate souffle to share.  All of it was extremely well-presented, and as for the actual flavor of the food--it was to die for.  I kid you not--this was, hands down, the best meal I've ever eaten in a restaurant to date.  Was it pricey?  Yes.  Was it worth it?  Heck yes!  After years of culinary monotony, Cure opened my eyes as to what cuisine could truly be, and instilled me with a thirst for more similar experiences.  If I had known then what I know now, I'd have ordered the Salumi platter, since this is their specialty.  Fortunately, however, this gives me a reason to return to Cure in the future.  One caveat: When we went, Cure was BYOB with a small corkage fee.  I understand that they now have a bar, and I believe that it's still BYOB, but the corkage fee is much higher now.",

The beef tartare had too many olives that overpowered the taste of the beef. My entree of hanger was supposed to be cooked medium as I requested, but it was almost entirely red. It did taste very good with the accompanying potatoes. My husband's chicken was \"cooked well\" and was \"moist\" and \"tasty\", but it had a sausage/chickpea/cucumber/etcetera mixture that tasted like \"bad curry\". We waited over an hour to receive the entrees. The waiters tended to us frequently. The food definitely has promise, but I just cannot give it higher than 3 stars, especially when it cost $100 for two people, not including drinks. I liked that the dress code was casual.",

Honestly, I really liked everything about this place. The servers were all great, the food was very, very good and expertly prepared, and the cocktails and wine were delish. I would love to see a couple more wines by the glass, but the bottle selection was great. The sourcing of ingredients really showed through in the final product, and the staff were all very knowledgable about the menu. The starters were all excellent, they nailed my favorite pork rillettes!!! The duck speck is out of control, and the mustards, beef tartare, and beans with tuna were just outta sight.   My only (and minor) reason to give it 4 instead of 5 stars is that I feel the kitchen could rely more on simplicity. While the starters were all amazing, the mains had a little too much going on, perhaps too many very intense components and so the dish loses focus just a little.   I absolutely recommend, and will go back as often as my waistline permits!!",

    "text": "Had a great meal last night at Cure.  My wife has been wanting to go there for some time now, and she went last weekend with a dear friend and then called me that she made reservations for us when I returned to town.  The restaurant has a great look and feel...definitely feels like a hunting lodge, but with a nice energy level.  The servers exuded that same energy, high level of finesse and knowledge, and treated everyone like a first class passenger.  Our server, Madeleine, gets top marks for just the right level of engagement with us, attention to detail, knowledge of the menu and the chef's style. My wife and I really liked the insights she shared about the restaurant which she had gleaned from working there about 4 years.    We started with the roasted oysters...I'm not a huge fan of oysters, but this preparation avoided the excessive brininess and it incorporated bacon, so of course I loved it. The salumi platter is a \"must-get\" every time I eat here (and I will be putting this restaurant in our regular lineup). The variety of cured meats and pates on the platter were outstanding and served at the correct temperature and thickness...again, really excellent attention to detail.  For our main dishes we wanted to try the pastas; my wife had the Orecchiette, and I had the Ricotta Cavatelli.  Both were very enjoyable, but the Ricotta Cavatelli was off the charts great...the right balance of heirloom tomatoes, cheeses, and olive oil with a perfectly chewy pasta makes this one of the most memorable pasta dishes I've had in some time.  We skipped dessert to enjoy some after dinner drinks.  It's not often I see a Pedro Ximenez sherry on a list and it was delicious.  Bravo to the staff at Cure for a great meal (first for me, second for my wife) and outstanding service by the entire team, particularly Madeleine.",

The best part is that it's BYOB so you get to spend your money on trying more dishes! I highly recommend making a reservation in advance especially if you plan to go on a Friday or Saturday night.

You order a 1 euro beer in Spain and can get jamon and sausages for free with better quality. Squab breast and steak are not bad though: the meat is medium to rare, nicely mixed with a selection of cheese, fruits, fruity sauce, making it not heavy and very fresh to taste.   The cocktails are average; the souffle is ok, smaller than even the French size, but doesn't require the usual 20 minutes to prepare somehow. Not an expert in wine, our point noir was 10$ per glass, perhaps the American standard.  The decoration, atmosphere, and service of the restaurant are quite good.",

When we arrived I asked the server if the chef could make me something without meat.  The chef made a lovely little starter plate with potatoes and fresh spring onions, cooked with sauces and spreads.  Its was quite good.  For my main the chef made falafel, again with special sauces and spreads.  I was pretty impressed since these things are not on the menu!  I liked when we went because the restaurant was BYOB, and had a 5$ corkage.  But they have since been granted a liquor license now sell their own.  I believe you can still BYOB but the corkage is a bit more.",

We also somehow managed to eat a few bites of a tasty chocolate dessert. Absolutely amazing dinner! A gem in Pittsburgh.",

Salumi platter was great- got to sample a lot of things. It was good for a first-timer although I probably wouldn't order it again. I saw reviewers complaining about lack of bread. I would agree with it but I'm wondering it's also intentional because bread would take away from all the delicious meats on that platter? Or maybe it's a statement saying that we Americans are in the (physical) state that we are because of our love for bread? Those were my deep thoughts during the meal btw. No joke. But LOVED LOVED their beef tartare. The server recommended it and it was almost orgasmic. All the flavors infused together was so lovely. The dark chocolate souffle cake was fantastic. I really enjoyed their cocktails- different from any I've had before and it'd be awesome if someone at Cure would tell me how to make it at home since I live all the way out in freaking Jersey? (hint, hint). But their rye whiskey and vodka cocktails were oh so delicious. Don't expect like a large glass of it, but a little goes a long way for these particular drinks. =)",

    "text": "Cure's been a tough weekend reservation since it opened at the beginning of this year.  That's because it's very small and very popular.  After 2 failed attempts, I was finally able to get a reservation for this past Sat. night.  Cure is located right on the corner of 54th and Butler in the \"dodgy\" end of Lawrenceville.  There's street parking only, no valet.  The space is very small but warm.  When we first walked in we heard Vampire Weekend blasting over the speakers so I figured this would be a good place.  Speaking of music, the other reviewers are correct that it is very loud (which may or may not be your thing).  We heard a ton of great bands which included Modest Mouse and The Clash.  I actually liked this because if you have good tunes, at least play them at a volume where people can hear them.  Some places like to say they have good tunes but don't play them loud enough for anyone to hear them (I'm looking at you Salt of the Earth).  Cure is BYOB only so I brought 2 bottles of beer:  Dogfish Head Noble Rot and Great Divide Yeti Oak-Aged Imperial Stout.  One of the waiters was very intrigued by the Noble Rot so I poured him some to try (will be important later).  We started off with the \"salumi for 2\" to get an introduction to the restaurant's specialty of cured meats.  The plate consisted of crostini with lardo, mordatella (fancy bologna), duck speck, chicken rillettes, chorizo, and cornichon (pork scraps).  It was all tasty (if you like this kind of stuff, and not everyone does), but the plate was very small.  It was really a \"salumi for 1\" and at $18, seemed a little steep.  For an entree, I had the duck breast and leg.  It was a very small plate.  Although delicious, there were only 2 small pieces of duck breast and most of the dish was leg confit.  I would have loved to have had more of the breast and at $28, this also seemed steep for the portion size.  We finished up with a cheese plate (again rather small) and the chocolate \"souffle\" cake (which didn't really have anything to do with chocolate souffle and was also small).  Both were very good, but again the portions were small.  I think Cure has a lot of potential.  The food is extremely flavorful, but the portions are just slightly too small for the current price point.  I'm not saying Cure should be giving out huge plates of food, but for $28 I'd like to have more than 2 small pieces of duck breast.    BYOB has it's own unique appeal and I think that Cure has immediately become the best BYOB place in Pittsburgh.  The corkage is only $3.  As a final point, I was slightly miffed when I saw that I was charged corkage for the beer that we shared with a waiter.  I'm always happy to share great beer with anyone, but it would have been a classy move to comp us the corkage for that bottle.",

    "text": "While this is one of my favorite restaurant spaces in Pittsburgh (reclaimed wood, intimate, with the elevated kitchen on display), and the waitstaff is some of the best in the city, Cure never really knocks it out of the park for me.  Obviously the chef is a great butcher and knows his way around cured meats. But I felt like the rest of the plates didn't bring much to the table. So much attention is paid to the meat that the rest of the dishes seem lacking. I've been there three times now, and I struggle to remember anything I've eaten, other than the cured meat platter, which is excellent. Also, I know it's a meat heavy place (it says it in the name), but a few vegetarian options other than a salad would be nice. The current fad for everything pork-related is nice for us meat-eaters, but if I'm going out with a vegetarian friend, I won't be coming to Cure. Why limit your patrons like that?  Again, it's clear that the chef and entire staff are committed to this place, which is a rarity in Pittsburgh. Maybe I've made bad menu choices but I always go wanting to be blown away and always leave underwhelmed.",

Drove all the way from Michigan and boy was it worth it!  We ordered the tuna crudo and porchetta tonato for appetizers.  I liked the tuna crudo more because it tasted more fresh but both were good and complex dishes.  For entree my wife had the walleyed pike and I had the hanger steak.  Honestly it was probably the best hanger steak I've ever had!  Seriously, the combination of the red wine shallots, caramelized onion, crispy leek, cipollini onion, cheddar cauliflower puree, and lobster bearnaise was the best combination I've had in a loong time, I'm not kidding!  The pike was also good with a nice seared crust.  Not to compare to meat and potatoes (which I know we did) but we had the pleasure of going there as well the night before.  Comparing the two, if you want a more hip young adult louder music type crowd with a bar then M&P is a good place to go (food is good there as well).  But if you want a more warm feeling dinner with awesome locally sourced food then I'd definitely recommend Cure!",

    "text": "I live across the street from the newly-opened Cure and my roommates and I have been anxiously watching the space be transformed.  This location used to be a seedy breakfast restaurant and had been vacant for more than a year when Cure began renovations.  The building is almost unrecognizable with its cozy and natural decor.    Eager to see if the growing hype about the restraurant and Chef Justin Severino was justified, a group of five of us went to the NYE price fixe dinner.  We were served a five-course family-style dinner including salumi w/ crostini, venison tartare, smoked trout, a white pork sausage, and a dessert tarte.    While everything was delicious and unique, the sausage was the absolute standout.  It had a very pleasing texture and was perfectly seasoned.  It was served with melted leeks and some baby potatoes, which were perfect companions.  Additionally, as we were a group of five eating family-style, someone noticed that the one plate of this amazing sausage just wasn't going to satiate us and brought us over a second helping!  I think they saw the sadness in our eyes that were would only get a few bites of this amazing meal.  Some additional notes: the roving wait staff was knowledgeable, friendly, prompt, and definitely added to the experience.  We spoke to a few of them throughout the meal and they all had the same laid-back, quick witted vibe about them.  Although we had delicious East End beer pairings with our meal, the restaurant is going to be BYOB on normal evenings.  Also, the menu is going to be constantly changing.  One of the waitresses said that they plan to locally source whatever they can find and incorporate it into a different menu daily(!).  Cure definitely lived up (and exceeded) my expectations.  All the buzz surrounding it is most definitely warranted and I can't wait to return.",

We started with the large Salumi board and even though it was just the two of us I was glad that we got it because we were able to try all of the different varieties of cured meats.  I was particularly fond of the lardo and the duck speck (possibly proscuitto).   I was hoping for a duck entree, but since none were available we decided to split the squab and pork belly, and boy was I glad that we did.  They split the entree for us without us requesting and even split I thought that the portion was good after the Salumi board.  The squab was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the pork belly was delicious.  My husband and I continue to disagree on this fact, but my favorite was the squab.  The entree was accompanied by grilled romaine lettuce, cornbread, and corn pudding.   For dessert we shared the cheese platter and the chocolate souffle cake.  Both were good, but I really didn't notice after the amazing entree.   I will definitely be back and can't wait to try some new things!",

There were some highlights and some misses but I had a good time and I think you should check this place out.  My wife and I showed up for an anniversary dinner and really enjoyed ourselves.    I ordered a 1/2 bread and butter. Bblack olive focaccia, whipped lard, EVOO, roasted garlic, preserve citrus, capers, fried rosemary.  I loved the little salad and the whipped lard.  The focaccia is ok.  I ordered this to accompany the porcini and roasted onion soup with fried egg, Beemster, marcona almond, cocoa nib.  All I tasted was porcini.  It comes out with the onion soup and the pour in the porcini portion.  I would pass.  It's rich and like I said it just tastes like porcini and isn't really interesting.    For an entree, I ordered the heritage farm chicken breast and leg confit, black olive caramel, artichoke barigoule, blistered grapes, terragon, crispy ham & parmesan chips.  Way too many flavor components.  The chicken was great and I really liked the olive caramel and artichoke.  The artichoke is delicate and doesn't stand up to the parmesan, crispy ham AND the olive caramel.  Less is more.  You don't have to try this hard and it really detracted overall.  I really liked the chicken and the confit leg.  Delicious.  The parmesan chip was not crispy and I think this is the thing I would have left off.  I would come back again and try more.  The bar is great and I liked my old fashioned.  Please muddle as it should be next time for me.  Thanks.",

While we didn't remember every variety that was on the plate our server did take the time to point out and explain each one (per the menu: breseola, black strap ham, culatello, coppa secca, finnochiona, negroni, goat mushroom madiera salami, cocoa- espelette salami, ciccioli, duck rillettes, pate campagnola, mortadella, lardo, Mediterranean lamb terrine, ndjua).  For my entree I had the Meyer Ranch Hanger Steak which was served with caramelized onion, roasted cauliflower, cheddar custard, lobster bearnaise, red eye bordelaise, crispy smoked fingerlings. The steak was cooked perfectly. The lobster bearnaise is a bit of creamy lobster heaven and went well with the steak. The fingerlings were well seasoned and went well with the cheddar custard.   My girlfriend had the Duck Confit which was served with bacon, flageolet beans, kale, creme fraiche, dijon, slow egg. I really enjoyed my meal but this might have been better. The kale was just crispy kale...it was good but nothing special. The duck was delicious and when you had a bite with all the components together this dish was to die for.    We don't typically order dessert but decided everything was so good so far that we should try something so we shared the Dark Chocolate Souffle Cake. The cake was served with pistachio butter, vin cotto, xvoo, sea salt. It sounded kind of weird at first but (again) when you got a bite with all the components it was terrific.

    "text": "Welcome to CURE!  Well, actually you need a reservation to dine here. Fortunately, there is a small bar area which seats 4 people. First come, first serve and no reservations required! We were seated at the bar where we were greeted by the bartender   Drinks were excellent and well made! Our mixologist was very knowledgeable with the drinks and helped us decide which drink we would prefer. We loved our drinks.   When I hear the word Cure, I imagine that they have cured meats. So decided to order Salumi, which was great! The cured meat was served with pickled vegetables, mustard or jam, and toast.   As a snack, we ordered the Artichokes a la Perigord. It consists of black truffle, burnt lemon fromage blanc, hazelnut, chervil, fried garlic, parmesan, pickled egg white. It was the most refreshing snack I've tasted. It may not look it, but the snack was well put together. The flavor profile just gelled well together!  I highly recommend the Squid Ink & Leek Ash Gnudi! I know what you are thinking! Squid ink? Just go with it! Gnudi is a version of gnocchi but made with ricotta cheese. Smoked goat cheese, Squid ink Gnudi, mint, black olive oil, and.... lamb heart bolognese. OKAY! Don't say ewww... TRUST ME, IT IS SO GOOD!  Also tried the Parisian Gnocchi. It was great. but after eating the Gnudi. I prefer the Squid ink Gnudi!  Lastly, for dessert I ordered the Maple Pots de Creme. Presentation was so cute! Served on a mason jar and a wooden cutting board. The dessert was great as well!  Sad to see this place temporarily close but I am really excited and looking forward to try your new restaurant, Morcilla, this summer!!",

    "text": "Did the 6 course tasting menu with my wife (really 7 courses) for V-Day. We should have done the wine pairing because we had 2 glasses each anyway! The service was top-notch and every single course blew us away. Each course had its own unique flavors and progressed from the previous  course to make for an ultimate pre-fix menu.   My favorite bites of the night were the homemade prosciutto, scallop crudo, fried fish with creme and caviar, and of course the ribeye steak with a yin and yang cream vs. red wine reduction and a bacon jam. We left full and fully satisfied with all aspects of Cure. I hope to go back soon - the only downsides are that it was as expensive as it gets, since we went all out, and the seating arrangements are almost on top of each other, so you get to know your neighbors well! It's almost expected in Lawrenceville, though. Overall an incredible meal and experience!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came here early Saturday evening - we had heard amazing things about Cure and definitely weren't disappointed. The food was fresh, flavorful, and expertly arranged and presented as upscale fine dining, but the atmosphere was rustic and cozy. We started out with a small salumi platter, which had very salamis and other meats that they cure themselves. Each slice of meat had a different texture and taste, so it was an adventure of different levels of smoky and salty. Definitely not your everyday deli meat selection! We also got the 6-course tasting menu, which was steep at $90 per person, but every bite had such intense and interesting flavor combinations that we did not regret it! First of all, each plate was impeccably thought out in terms of the flavor profile and how the food was arranged and designed on the plate. One thing I would warn is to plan to stay for at least 2 hours if you get the tasting menu, since it took some time to get each dish out sequentially. One of the highlights for me was definitely the beginning of the first course. The oysters were refreshing and had the perfect amount of seasoning and acidity. They also did their raw meats well with the cured tuna and beef tartare. The cured tuna had the most satisfying fresh-fish texture marinated with a refreshingly light acidic liquid and tied together by the sweetness of the dried orange peel. Another highlight for me was the beet salad and the soup. The beet salad was so colorful and beautifully arranged on the plate, it looked like a piece of art. The earthy taste of the beets in the salad married perfectly with the sour flavors of the picked vegetables. The soup was rich and hearty, with the nuttiness of the almonds complimenting the cheese and fried egg mixture. One criticism I have was that the main course, the veal cheek was a bit disappointing. The flavors of the meat were good, but I found that it was very fatty and heavy along with the bread and needed something to balance out the heaviness. All in all, we had a great experience and will be back to try some of the other meat entrees and pastas!",

The thought, execution, and complexity that go into the dishes are evidenced by things like the blueberry sauce and the turnip puree that came with my perfectly cooked duck.  We also shared a large charcuterie plate, complete with gourmet mustards.  They also had this divine olive and focaccia bread, basically combining my two favorite breads.  I could eat that bread every day.  Sweet and savory together are some of my favorite things, and this meal was filled with it. From the entree to my drink (it had rosemary!) to the salted ooey gooey chocolate cake, I walked out of Cure a happy camper.",

For starters I ordered the small order of Bread and \"Butter\" and it was amazing!  It was black olive focaccia bread with whipped lard, salt and roasted garlic, preserve citrus, capers with fried rosemary.   For dinner I had the Beef Tartare. It was topped with pickled jalapeno, oyster aioli, black garlic, shallot and cured egg yolk. You mixed it all up and ate it with salt & vinegar chips on butter lettuce. I also ordered a small order of  Spaghetti Carbonara it was comprised of salty pork bits, peas, eggs, roasted garlic, soffit and topped Pecorino Romano.  It was all AMAZING!!!!

    "text": "I wanted to love Cure. I really did.   In general, the rustic setting with gorgeous charcuterie, well-executed pastas, and stunning drinks is my jam. What can I say, I'm an upwardly-mobile, early-80s-born millennial that regularly browses Thrillist, Eater, and worships at the alter of Anthony Bourdain. In short, if it's a porky, smoky delight, I'm going to freaking love it.  And the food? The food was outstanding. The large salumi platter was everything I could have hoped for - a perfectly preserved platter of the cast of Orwell's \"Animal Farm\". Yes, please and thank you.   Ah, but that's where the problem lies. Animal Farm.  \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.\" Or should I say waitresses.  Wow, was our service from our primary waitress bad. Uncomfortably awful. And to be realistic, it's difficult to enjoy your meal when you are made to feel like you are clearly inconveniencing the staff by daring to be present in their restaurant. I've never experienced anything like this before and I've been to plenty of restaurants of similar caliber. I can handle snobby. Hell, sometimes I can be snobby. I can handle pretentious - I have strong opinions on types of whiskey and balsamic vinegar. My brother and I regularly approach Fraiser/Niles Crane levels of obnoxiousness. But this, this was something else entirely. It was a unique hybrid of middle school A-lister discovering a chubby band geek at her lunch table and an IT director with aspergers feigning hospitality while also wanting to stab someone with a bread knife.  In short, I think Chef Severino's vision for the food was artfully executed at Cure and I commend the kitchen staff for everything they've done. The front of house (well, only one waitress in particular), I will leave with a single word...  Yikes.",

I was expecting a pasta dish with meat sauce, but I was wrong. I mean, gnocchi is pretty heavy so I ended up being full but let's just say the dish wasn't what I expected. My friend got the chicken. I had a bit and it was really juicy and tender. There was also a lot of things happening on her plate at the same time. The way she described it was there were too many flavors on her plate at one time which I totally understand. There were nuts and sauces and yogurt and honey, and I don't know. A bit too much for us. The dishes weren't what we exactly expected but the food was pretty good.  We didn't get a dessert but I walked by the chef's counter while going to the bathroom and it looked delicious. I kind of regretted it as I walked by.",

Here's the skinny on Cure...  - Make a reservation...it's a very cute and rustic...and also popular and tiny. - The bar is 4 seats, so don't think you can just roll in there and find a spot. - The food is amazing.   I did the salumi and the duck...both were full of flavor and texture. - Portions are a tad larger than most fine dining.  I cleaned both plates and was stuffed.   The duck alone would have been enough, but who could resist trying an app.  Two apps equals a good meal...most apps, anyway.    - Drinks are expensive.   $10 small cocktails and 4-5oz? wine by the glass starting at $11 (there were one or two options under $10, but nothing I wanted to drink).    -  They don't do separate checks, but will run multiple cards (after you labor over the math yourself).    Overall, a solid option.",

My friends got the Salumi plate and my boyfriend and I shared the Halloumi cheese starter. They split it onto two separate plates for us and I wish I didn't agree to split it with him!   The entrees only got better. We got the pork belly, steak and the spaghetti carbanera (made vegetarian for me). All fantastic.   The chef did not ask how we wanted our meat cooked, instead made his dishes as he thought were best and we had no complaints!   I've seen poor reviews on the service here but we did not have this experience. Unfortunately I cannot remember our waitresses name, but she had blue hair, and was very pleasant! She went through all of the menu items that were or could be made vegetarian and asked the chef if he could change something up to accommodate a food allergy we had. We had an 8:15 reservation on a week day and she did not rush us even when we were still there at 10:15.   Lastly, the kitchen was very clean and fun to walk past on the way to the bathroom to check out. Chef Severino said hello to us even while he was busy in the kitchen with a full restaurant.   Highly recommend.",

The first thing that you'll notice is that the restaurant is very small, although the tables are aligned and spaced out nicely enough to feel cozy. Service was fast, attentive, and informative. Cocktails here were very good, and the table beside us thought it looked cool. We ordered half a dozen oysters, maple cured and smoked salmon appetizer, half order of porcini mushroom parpadelle, chicken, and hanger with additional foie gras. Everything tasted superb and on point. Dishes were plated beautifully and great as foodporn material if you want to show off on your social media. One thing that prevented me from giving a 5 stars is the fact that my additional foie gras cost $14, but what I got was probably the smallest Foie gras I've ever been served. Not even close to being a $14 addition. That left me very disappointed. I've paid $19 for a foie gras dish at a top restaurant in New York City, and the size was probably 3 times of what I was given last night. Would still recommend this to anyone, just don't get that extra Foie gras.",

Want to know how the house sodas are made?  No problem.  Want to know the interesting history of Lairds Distillery?  Done.  Just exactly what is gnudi and how is it made?  They would love to tell you.  We even learned the provenance of the wild boars(pigs?) heads hanging on the wall.  Service was provided with ease and attentiveness in all phases of the meal while being unpretentious and fun.  Now on to the food.  I don't have a fine dining vocabulary so this will be short.  The Salumi platter is world class.  It's a few steps above cured meats, terrines, rillettes you can get elsewhere.  Two of us had the duck confit, and the others had the gnudi pasta and the tagliatelle pasta.  My duck confit was bone in and had a wonderful crispy skin.  The gnudi pasta was also a standout.  It had a soupy broth (brodo), which was a perfect complement to the weight of the gnudi.  There are lots of flavors in these dishes.  It is a lot of fun to experience this.  The menu is seasonal and will always change.    The wine was good (Pinotage) and my dad and I enjoyed a very good red rye ale from Spoonwood Brewery.  This is a very well made beer, great lacing and mouthfeel, and served at a great temperature.  I like tasty beer and it is certainly worth a mention.  You can get a Straub on tap for $3.  A couple of Straubs, Salumi, and some other appetizers would be a glorious meal.  The coffee is also very good...my macchiato was terrific.    PS.  I read some comments about bar seating.  On an earlier visit, we had seats at the bar.  Highly recommended!  The bartender was able to knock out these amazingly precise cocktails yet carry on a great conversation with us.  Don't think I could do that.  Haha.  And you get a great view of the kitchen as well!",

    "text": "A serious wow.  I had low expectations, because I'm not really a cured meat person. But a group wanted to go, and who was I to say no? So glad that I didn't.  We started with the salumi starter plate, which was a really nice way to ease into the whole cured meat thing. Delicious! And good to share. We also shared a ramps dish, which was \"eh\" but given that ramps are in season for only three weeks a year, we had to try it. We also had the beef tartare and that was a solid thumbs up.  Hubby tried one of their sausages, while I had their hanger steak. Normally, I am not a hanger steak kind of girl, but this really knocked it out of the ballpark. Perfectly cooked, great mix of flavors, super tender... I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it, and can't wait to go back. Sadly, I'd probably just have the same thing again.  Service is good, and the atmosphere is a bit rustic industrial, like Salt, but more intimate. What a great addition to the Pittsburgh scene!",

Started with the big salami board which had about 15-20 different authentic cured meats that you really couldn't try anywhere else. It was amazing such variety and flavor well worth the price when sharing with a group. We also tried the beef tartar appetizer which was delicious but towards the side of small on proton size when compared to the price, the sweet sauce that the tartar was presented with really brought out full flavor. For an entree I fell in love with the \"Gluttony\" this was a sampling of 4 different varieties of pork including 2 sausage a pork tenderloin and some fried pork hush puppy like thing. It was amazing just incredible, a great capturing of what this restaurant has to offer. The wine sauce and baked apples were a perfect sauce pairing for the pork. This is easily one of the top restaurants in pittsburgh and the service and decor only help compliment the overall experience as well.",

Despite a little snafu with the reservation on my last visit, they still seated us - at the chef's counter, which actually made it way better than the other meals I've had at one of the tables.  (The entire kitchen staff was really friendly and willing to chat when they had time around their very busy Saturday night crowd.  Sounds like they all really love food.)    This place would be five stars anywhere, which makes it, like, a six-star place in Pittsburgh.  A few weeks ago, I ate at a well-reviewed \"pig\" place in DuPont Circle in DC, and it paled in comparison to Cure.    The salumi is a must-have, as always.  We also split an excellent bitter greens salad and a duck confit (which they very awesomely plated for us as half-portions on two plates), which was incredible.  The panna cotta was outstanding, too.  Everything we saw being plated in front of us looked mouth-watering, too - seriously doubt any of the other dishes would disappoint.    Seriously: vegetarians should not even think about eating here.  You'd be an a-hole for asking them to cater to your diet.",

Also shared the Strawberry Everything, which was a wonderful tour of strawberry deserts.  I had the Gluttony of Pork, and was not disappointed, and experienced pork in new ways.  In spite of the name, there were also a wonderful chicken dish (mom's), and a salmon dish which we did not order, but definitely tempting!  In spite of the name of my dish, don't go there to pig out -- go there to savor... slowly.  Makes me proud to be a Pittsburgher!",

    "text": "Cure is one of Pittsburgh's hottest restaurants...or apparently that is the case. Unfortunately, our experience didn't satisfy on both the food and service fronts.  First, the food. The food I would give maybe three stars to, but I wouldn't say it was spectacular. Over-rated is perhaps a more apt description. Don't get me wrong, Mr. Severino and his team turn out some tasty meat-centric dishes. The problem seems to be that no one got the memo that, in the fine dining world, less is often more. By that I mean that the dishes had some  interesting things going on in terms of flavors and ingredient combinations, but there was just too much going on. Too many things on the plate. I've seen this at some other apparently \"hot\" Pittsburgh restaurants recently and, to put it plainly, it just irritates me. It isn't that the food is bad--it is good, and at times very good--but that it is trying to be too innovative. Focus on fantastically fresh and high-quality ingredients and do them justice. That's all that is needed.  Second, the service. I'd give the service just one star, maybe less. It was downright obnoxious. And the bad experience started as soon as we stepped inside. First, we were gruffly taken to our table by a hostess who didn't have the courtesy to smile or to wish us a nice meal. Second, they didn't offer to take our coats. Third, our server lacked warmth and was at times just rude. Here's an example. My wife wanted to order some steak. Due to a dietary restriction (which she is not a fan of but has to accept for the time being, let's put it that way), she requested the steak be cooked medium well. The server said, and I quote, \"No, they won't do that. It has to be medium rare, or maybe medium but otherwise they won't cook it.\" My wife further explained the situation and was told she could just have the fish. No friendly apologetic manner, or attempt to even pretend to sound like she was accommodating. This was rude and made the chef sound incredibly pretentious. When some of the finest three-Michelin-star restaurants in the country can accommodate these types of requests with ease why can't Cure? This was not the only problem with the staff, but serves as an example.  So overall would I return? No. The food was above average but not spectacular. And the service needs some serious adjustment. Maybe our server had an off night, but that's not the impression I formed. It felt more like a restaurant that has an attitude. What a shame, because Pittsburgh needs more above-average food places with talented chefs, but we don't need places with bad attitudes.",

However, our server seemed hell bent on getting us out of there in an hour and was dismayed that we took longer than 10 minutes to decide on our choices (asking 3 times between wine and appetizers delivered). They cleared our apps without asking if we were through, they came over three times to attempt to clear dinner that were clearly not done (seriously 15 min with entree). After we asked for the dessert menu, a friend came in to the restaurant and wanted to join us for a drink. We were told that they could not accommodate 5 of us and that we needed to pay our check. I would've understood this policy had it been explained in any way, but she just said \"I'm sorry, you can't order dessert, I'm just going to leave your check.\" As a server in the fine dining industry for 15 years I was embarrassed and appalled. We were literally being kicked out. The management seemed highly defensive, and immediately sent us to the owner. We then attempted to explain to the owner why we felt we're were treated so poorly. He had no patience for it-- definitely sided with kicking us out before he had heard us out. The food was really good. I'll give them that, but we were all left with the feeling that the establishment wasn't very accommodating or welcoming to their guests, and it really soured the experience. Won't return, nor recommend friends. I'd like to add one friend flew in from San Fran and another drove in from D.C. and the 5th friend was originally working late & coming out after Cure but ended up showing up early as last cocktails and dessert were being ordered.",

One of my top two restaurants in Pittsburgh, I have never been less than completely impressed with any dish at Cure.  Their foie blonde, a foie gras and chicken liver pate, is exceptional, and had my friend, who is a professional chef, literally in tears of joy.  Of course, their house cured meats are the star, and every time I go there I order the large salumi board.  Every item on the salumi board is phenomenal, so it is very difficult for me to choose any one favorite.  In my many ventures to Cure, I have sampled their boudin blanc, hanger steak, duck confit, braised veal cheeks, pork belly gnocchi, and many other items.  Quite frankly, every single dish has been wonderful.  The atmosphere is unique.  It is a small but charming restaurant with unique decor that is befitting of a restaurant that specializes in charcuterie.  The only caution I have is that this is a meat place -- they frequently have vegetarian options, but the star of this restaurant is the way they do their meats.  If you love meats, then I can't recommend Cure enough.",

    "text": "Thoroughly impressed.  Kudos to the chef!  Let me preface this by saying I'm a huge fan of cured meats/fish, pate, foie gras, etc. so this place was a must as soon as I found out about it. And always a plus, it's a BYOB!  The atmosphere was relaxing and quaint.  Service was prompt and friendly.  I liked the rustic feel of the menu on a chalkboard as well as on the wooden clipboard they provide.  Be forewarned that the menu is also very meat-centric.  But also be aware that the chef will gladly fire up some vegetarian options upon request.  For the starters:  The salumi was outstanding and a must-have.  The smoked trout was delightful and had just the right amount of smokiness as to not overwhelm the palate.  The golden carrot soup...well...let me just say as a self-proclaimed soup connoisseur, I was elated with this soup.  Every element went so well together.  Sweet, savory, creamy, meaty from the venison chorizo, crispy from the sunchokes and kale.  Just a perfect combination of flavors and textures.  For entrees: The foie gras boudin blanc was utterly delightful.  The Sausage had just the right amount of crunch in the casing, and a perfect combination of meatiness and creaminess in the actual sausage.  It came with melted leeks, apples, mustard, and bearnaise.  If there's something I can't emphasize enough, it's my love of the sweet and savory flavor profiles.  Cure does it well.  I also can't fail to mention the duck confit.  The meat was succulent and juicy, the skin was crispy.  Just like how duck should be.  Overall, the meal was excellent and the overall experience was great too.  I will definitely be coming back for more!",

Normally - I wouldn't write a review on that...I'm an understanding, forgiving person.  But really, service was awesome, and they are running like a well oiled machine.  I've been on a no carb, no dairy, no sugar diet - so maybe anything ANYTHING I put in my mouth would be amazing - but I think this was better than that.    Our fun three-some started with the Salumi plate and the Cheese plate (technically a dessert - but shutttupp)   I like when something is served with the description ... 'this is Justin's prosciutto\"   When I grow up I want to have something of mine introduced that way. {this is Megan's Powerpoint...doesn't have the same ring}  I can't remember all the cheeses - but I LIKED them.  and they were served with prunes in brandy, honey, and some other stuff that rocked.  In addition to the prosciutto were about 4-5 other rocking meats - pate de campaigner (my french is off), mortadella, and some other stuff.  All awesome.  Then, THEN... The butternut squash soup.  Rarely am I impressed with presentation, but this delivered. All three of us ordered it.... They brought three shallow bowls out - that did not contain soup. they included a link of goat sausage (grilled and sliced), a larger-than-a-dollop of goat cheese, fried kale, and maybe some fried garlic cloves. Then, THEN... they had a tea kettle filled with the soup that they poured over the previously mentioned deliciousness.  Wow. it was good. (the sausage may have been heavy on the lavender seasoning, but that is parallel to me saying Michelangelo was heavy handed on the sistine chapel)  Then there were entrees.  I'm going to assume these will probably change on a semi-regular basis, but what we had tonight was awesome.  We were already full. And by this point the euphoria of dairy and carbs had worn off.  But the 3 of us shared a Pork shoulder/pork cheek entree as well as a chicken entree.  Both were awesome.  I won't do them justice.    So beyond the food, it is a small restaurant - with about 6-8 tables and a bar at the kitchen.  It's cozy and welcoming.  It's byob.  My friend thinks the lighting in the open kitchen is harsh - I think it makes the kitchen the star.     Go, you won't be disappointed.",

GF and I were hungry a little early on Saturday night with no firm plans, made the call to Cure, got seated at the little bar by about 5:45pm and ate until almost 7pm.  Without diving into the expectations we had going in (just covering the food/drinks/service), we got the tuna crudo and brussel sprouts to start, the rabbit and butternut squash risotto for entrees and the dark chocolate souffle for dessert.  I had fedora punch cocktail (yummy and boozy) to start, a glass of bordeaux for the entree (tasty and an easy drinker), and a really solid bourbon to finish.  The tuna was very good, lots of flavors, but potentially a tad too saucy.  The brussel sprouts were quite tasty with the goat cheese/bacon, and an interesting twist with some spicy peppers.  My rabbit was very good - much like a terrine with large chunks of rabbit, it came with garnishes of hazelnuts, pomegranate seeds and chestnut puree.  Very good flavors, but a tad too saucy with the puree (and the pomegranate seeds were a little tart and out of place).  The GFs risotto was very good with some salty pancetta, mozarella and very interesting chianti foam.  The dessert, a very rich (and gluten free!) dark chocolate souffle with pistachio butter was very good.  Overall, a great dining experience with friendly staff, some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh.  Wish it was down in lower Lawrenceville so it was more convenient, but overall a great spot with unique food, drinks and atmosphere.",

The staff was very friendly and Justin, our server, went out of his way to walk us through both the drink menu and the dinner menu. He was knowledgeable and attentive but not overly so. The chicharrones were delicious, and arrived at the table still warm. We snacked on those while deciding on the rest of our meal. Our next course, was the \"light\" Salumi, and we found it to be the perfect combination of small bites, especially the Speck. For the main course, my wife chose the Hangar steak, and it was so flavorful and tender. I went with Gluttony, which had a decidedly German theme to it, with two types of sausage, a pork tenderloin, and my favorite taste of the night the pig trotter croquette. All this was accompanied by sauerkraut and potatoes. Hence the name Gluttony.  For drinks, I had the gin cocktail and the Mezcal as well. Both were delicious. My wife was pleased to find that they offered Fighting Elleck from Arsenal Cider. Her favorite from that local gem. All in all it was an excellent night, and an excellent meal. We will eat there again.",

I've driven up 54th street nearly every day since Cure has been open and there's always a white car parked illegaly right on the corner in front of the restaurant - practically in the crosswalk.  This atrocious parking job causes a LOT of traffic issues for residents trying to get in and out of that street because this car blocks traffic.  I've had to back back into traffic numerous times because the road is too tight for two cars to get through.

    "text": "Loved it.  Lived up to the hype IMO.  Since this place has been reviewed ad naseum, I'll keep this short (er).  Cure has been on my list of places to try for a long time.  Finally went with my DH last night.  We shared the small salumi, the goat rodeo brulee, and the bread.  All were fantastic, particularly the brulee.  (I don't think I've ever felt like paying for bread was worth it before...) DH had the duck and I had a half order of the Tagliatelle.  We both liked our dishes.  Mine was by far the best pasta dish I've had in ages, perhaps ever.  For drinks, he:  bourbon cocktail and a red rye beer (blanking on which); me: gin cocktail (probably the only thing I ordered I'd skip next time), a pinotage (a nice change from the usuals you see), and a flight of amaros (DO THIS!).  Service was very knowledgeable and perhaps over-attentive? Total tab was $125 before tip,which was more than reasonable for what we had.  Bottom line:  I loved the experience and the combination of flavors and ideas.  If you're a foodie and enjoy eating as an event, this place is definitely for you.  (Apparently, the mayor agrees... he was seated a few tables down.)  However, if you are a food purist or think too many flavors clutter a plate, you'll think this place is over-priced/over-hyped and might find the portion sizes too small.  (If you think Olive Garden is actually Italian food or would identify a steak joint as your favorite restaurant, I'm looking at you...)  My husband fell into this later category -- he appreciated the execution and thought the dishes were well-done, but the place wouldn't rank on his list of favorites.  He said if we were given a GC and could eat for free, he'd likely have me take my mother (who would enjoy the meal more than he).    Also, you certainly do seem to need a res to get into this place even on Sunday early.",

Don't come here expecting to order chicken or steak. Menu consisted of veal, pork, rabbit, squid, duck etc.  At recommendation of the waiter, I started with a ravioli appetizer with a unique pesto sauce. Absolutely mouth watering....I could have eaten that as my meal if they offered a full portion. Ordered pork for my meal...also very good. BF ordered veal and it was oh so tender. Food was SO unique and absolutely delicious and sometimes surprising (I have to admit we had to google a few ingredients on the menu). Definitely a fun dining experience.",

    "text": "Incredible! Me and two friends came to cure for a \"live above our means\" night. We were all blown away. I started by ordering a fighting Elleck hard cider that was really great (almost wine-like). We then got a salumi plate to share which was fun. Very high quality cured meats with unbelievable amounts of flavor. None were at all overly salty which is often my criticism of cured proteins. I would have loved to try some of their cured seafood (next time). As my main plate I got seared duck breast with beats and radishes, mustard and blueberry sauces. The duck was out of this world. Probably some of the best bites of animal protein I'd ever had in my life. Medium rare (maybe closer to rare, but I'm not a trained chef) with a meaty but melt in your mouth texture. It definitely called for a red wine though; my cider was a bit out of place. The beets and radishes were really smokey in flavor which was very interesting but they were a little soggy in texture. I might have preferred a more crisp roast on them. The dish also had a pancake of sorts made with dick meat scraps. It was ok. A bit flavorless and mushy. I can imagine someone else loving that pancake thing but it just wasn't for me. The sauces were perfect and the presentation beautiful. My friends both ordered the walleye which they both enjoyed. Service was great. Everything came out in a nice amount of time, giving us a chance to savor the evening and the rustic atmosphere while not letting us get impatient.  Will definitely be back and will definitely check out any other restaurants chef Justin Severino has anything to do with.",

    "text": "My husband and I are foodies in the sense that we LOVE food and particularly enjoy 1. farm-to-fork establishments even more so if 2. they are inventive.  I'll give this place inventive. I had a bacon-infused cocktail that was shaken with a whole egg. Now, I LOVE inventive cocktails. I consider myself somewhat of a cocktail connoiseur (hands down best cocktails ever = Santaella in Puerto Rico). This eggy, bacon concoction was just weird, though.  On to the main course. My husband had the Heritage Farm Chicken Breast & California Chorizo Sausage. The mole crumb was yummy. But the chicken was so (so, so!) very dry!! So much so, he requested more sauce to help make it palitable (if this had been a larger restaurant, we'd have sent the dish back....we didn't want to hurt their bottom line).   I ordered the King Salmon. I love King Salmon -- I've prepared it many times. The plate was $34 -- not outrageous for King Salmon. And it would have been a steal if it was good.... but sadly it was mushy. The table next to us sat three couples -- each of the wives ordered this dish and I noticed not one ate even half. Again, if this hadn't been a mom and pop operation, the fish would have gone back....  The restaurant is cute and rustic. Although the tables and chairs feel like they'd be better suited for a diner. Our waitress was friendly and attentive.   We came to Pittsburgh for a foodie weekend... and had anticipated that this would be the pinnacle. We left, unfortunately, feeling like our time (and money) would have been better spent elsewhere...",

    "text": "I ate here this past Friday evening for dinner with my girlfriend and her friend.  We got to the restaurant at around 7:30 and I was surprised to find it half empty for that time on a Friday night.  However, throughout the night the tables filled in and by the time we finished dinner the place was full and so I would recommend reservations.  It is also a BYOB place for which we we paid a $3 corkage fee for our bottle of wine and I don't think there was a single table without some kind of adult beverage on it.  The decor of the restaurant is kind of cool with a wooden wall with a few minor pig decorations.  This matches their menu which is a piece of paper on a wooden plank.  It also seems like it was built in what used to be a split level house as the dining room is at the bottom and up a short flight of stairs is a food bar.  This bar faces the kitchen where you could watch the chefs cook and also see everything like the hanging freshly made pasta.  The next time that I visit this place I think that I would enjoy sitting up there.  We decided to start off our meal with both the squid ink spaghetti and the SALUMI plate.  I have it capitalized there as there are actually two different salumi starters on the menu with the larger of the two being capitalized.  The salumi plate came out on a plank of wood and consisted of a large number of cured meats and pates, some pickled vegetables, a few pieces of a crusty bread and 3 different kinds of mustard (stone-ground, regular and balsamic vinegar).  Almost everything on the plate was amazing and I even enjoyed a few of the pates which I can't say that I ever had before.  My girlfriend and her friend also really enjoyed the stone-ground mustard and made some comments about how they would be willing to buy a bottle of it.  The squid ink spaghetti came served with the black noodles in a sauce topped with a bit of anchovies like fish all next to a sunny side up egg.  It was wonderful as the noodles paired perfectly with the sauce and were delightful with some egg yolk over them.  The only thing I did not enjoy was the fish due to the intense fishy flavor but I get how the saltiness help cut in the decadence of the dish.  For my entree I decided to order the duck which was served on the bone and fried on top of a bed of red cabbage.  It was pretty to look at and the flavor of the duck was great with my only complaint of it being that the little bit right underneath the batter was a bit greasy for my liking.  The cabbage was also good but rightfully played second fiddle to the duck.  The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back in the future.  Heading into here I was skeptical of all of the hype that I had read surrounding this restaurant but they certainly made me a believer.",

    "text": "I went back here recently when a couple of friends were in town.  One was a meat lover like myself but the other was vegetarian.  I contacted the restaurant to see if they could accommodate a vegetarian (since everything on the menu, including the veggie sides has meat in them), and they said that they could make a special off menu option for my vegetarian friend which I was very pleased by.  They wouldn't let her select what she wanted but she was able to indicate a preference for something pasta related and what they brought her was a complete surprise, which was fun but it may be better to offer a little more flexibility or options.  It ended up being a papperdelle pasta with a light mushroom sauce and broccoli and it was very good though maybe a bit on the salty side.  I ordered the papperdelle with pig trotter and octopus sugo and it was very good but I found the sauce to be a little on the rich and sweeter side than I'd like.  We also got the large salumi plate which was as fantastic as ever, but they increased their price substantially so now it is $40 instead of $30, which was disappointing.  And they no longer offer any cheese options.  I still love Cure but for these reasons I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars for this visit.  I also ordered a mezcal cocktail which had strawberry juice in it and it was garnished with a slice of lightly burnt lemo, which was so fantastic I ordered two.  The smokiness of the mezcal worked so nicely with the subtle strawberry and lemon flavors.",

Overall an excellent meal -  nice homey but modern decor, solid service, and creative tasty food - with just a couple minor quibbles.  The Food: -My Brussel sprout, pear, and endive salad was a little disappointing, but still enjoyable. My nursing background has made me a bit adverse to pureed foods, and the two thick purees (a black one and a pickled pumpkin one) that came with the salad didn't make sense texturally with the shaved brussel sprouts and endive- I would have preferred roasted pickled pumpkins cubes and a vinaigrette or something. - Our entrees - the Walleyed Pike, Duck Confit, and Braised Pig Cheek Ragu - were all excellent. The proteins were cooked perfectly and flavors worked super deliciously together. Again though, my plate had one puree to many on it. - Frozen Creme Brulee: amaaazing, delicious and unexpected! It was served like a cake instead of in a ramekin, surrounded by a port wine foam, pear butter, and coffee crumble.  *Also, as others have said, its no longer BYOB. I went to work a night shift after we ate so can't comment on the cocktails but my parents were happy with their beer selections.",

Cure has got it all figured out: food, service, and ambiance.    When we entered the restaurant at 6:30, we noticed that all of the tables were full (except ours), yet it didn't seem overcrowded.  The tables weren't too close together; we didn't feel like we had to whisper so as not to disturb the neighboring tables.    We had the Salumi appetizer (I don't eat meat, but that mustard was unlike anything I've ever had!).  I'd also highly recommend the heirloom tomato appetizer (watermelon, basil, white balsamic foam, pine nut brittle, goat cheese, and fennel pollen).  I had the trout as my entree, and I can't say enough good things about it.  It was light and not at all greasy, and the creamy almond aioli paired perfectly with it.    Nice touches: -Corkage fee is CHEAP! -The chalkboard lists all of the local farms that Justin buys from...It even notes what he buys from each farm.  Loved the heirloom tomatoes?  Now you know where to buy them. -Michael Pollan books in the women's bathroom :) -Justin, the chef and owner, seems like a truly nice guy.  He was smiling and talking to customers, and he didn't seem to have that suuuper cocky attitude that head chefs tend to have. -#13 out of 50 best new restaurants in the COUNTRY according to Bon Appetit magazine... enough said!",

I will agree that the Salumi plate is worth getting for the varieties of flavor.   The lardo was like Ricky from the trailer park boys explaining the merits of dipping bread heels in bacon grease. Mmm bacon. I enjoyed most of them thoroughly.  I ordered the pork belly, which given my affinity for pork products, and particularly bacon, is not surprising. Best choice ever. It was a dense, and delicious hunk of meat. The flavors of the meat and the curing process were the emphasis, so there were no frivolous seasonings.   A perfect, slightly tough crispy exterior which tasted exquisitely fatty and delicious with every bite.   I took each bite very slowly to simply savor the flavor and it really did me a favor. I should have signed a waiver; \"it was so good it hurt\" is what I told the waiter. I should also tell you bout them taters, smokey and cheesy, I couldn't wait until later, too delicious and quite lascivious, I will return, ever epicurious.",

For our entree we shared the Pork and Squab plate. The server brought out our entree already split, on two plates, which was a nice touch (especially for no extra charge!)  The pork and the squab fought for the title of best bite. My wife and I still disagree on which was better. The plate was garnished with roasted romaine lettuce, chanterelle mushrooms, and a mix of corn pudding and corn bread. Do not miss this dish if you have the chance.

The reason I gave four stars was due to the duration of time between plates and the upselling of drinks which were very pricey.  I felt like they were upselling drinks 2x per plate serving.  So not only were you paying for a high priced meal which I thought was fantastic, but I was getting hit up about 8 times on the drinks which were about 10-12each.  I think we were there for about 2 hours and although it was nice to relax, I wish it would have been 1 hr.  Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't consider the staff to be slow or inattentive, I just think it's how they are attempting to manage the atmosphere.... and maybe sell a few more drinks.",

Because we raise grassfed beef and lamb, and nonGMO fed pastured/silvopastured pork and poultry, we are very discerning when it comes to dining out (especially where meat is concerned.

The fantastic decor, impeccable  service and incredible menu and presentation backed up all of the good things we'd heard and read. The food, however, FAR EXCEEDED our highest hopes.

My husband, the pickier of the two (of us) who has more sophisticated palate, really really enjoyed every flavor of the food we had there. We don't always enjoy salumi, but we finished every single stuff on the plate in a breeze and a few I didn't even get to taste (never knew my children were so open to new foods...) They were very accommodating and friendly for my children (9 &6), as they served pasta altered to my daughter's request. I had braised pork belly which was perfect and beef tartare, probably the best i had in Pittsburgh. The portions, as with all good things, isn't large so we ended up going back to the menu and ordered a few more. We made an early reservation at five, in case my children disrupts other customers' dates, so we were done by 6:00-6:30 but was still sorry to leave the place!",

    "text": "I have to say that I had very high expectations going to Cure - especially since we went for the New Year's Eve prix fix dinner (with drink pairings). I went in with an open mind and left full, happy, and excited about the fact that this place is in my hometown.  We started with Island Creek Oysters. I'm not a fan of oysters, in general. I will say that they were perfectly chilled with an excellent tomato and onion chutney of sorts. The second appetizer was a platter of what Cure calls \"snacks\" - and what I call: Heaven. The beef tartar is the only item that I wasn't crazy about but that's not for lack of high-quality beef, just personal preference. The foie blonde was new to my palette and a welcome treat. The salmon nduja was quite smoky, and hard to get over the initial horror at spreadable fish salami; however, it's uniqueness is not soon forgotten. My favorite was the fried mortadella on toasted baguette with a fried quail egg. I could've eaten any entire plate of them.  The second course was smoked Laurel Hill Farm trout, with sesame lavash, leek ash yogurt, and a trio of sauces, including blood orange, cucumber, and herbed maple syrup. Reading the description, I wasn't sure how accessible the dish would be - or how it would all work together - but it was insanely good. Strangely enough, it reminded me of my childhood, fishing for trout and eating it for breakfast. This dish, albeit high-end, was a nostalgic throwback to summer for me. The viogner was, as expected, the perfect pairing.  The third course was celeriac and taleggio ravioli in an Appalachian Perigord truffle and chervil, hazelnut beurre noisette. I have never, and will never, eat a ravioli that so successfully encapsulated creamy, cheesy, herby, woody, nutty flavors all in a few bites of nirvana. And here's where I had my Pittsburgh food scene nerd moment. Upon asking the waiter how the truffles could possibly be from Appalachia, we were graced with a few seconds of time from Justin Severino himself, the chef and co-owner of Cure. I heard *most* of what he had to say in his brief lesson on this type of truffle but, mainly, I was honored and awe-struck with his table-side visit. The Italian red paired with this dish was everything you'd hope it would be - and stood up to the star power of the truffle.  The fourth course was 3 Cheers Farm lamb \"porchetta.\" While Cure's version of this dish is a laborious, masterful effort that yields a mouth-watering result. Add in smoked potato fondue, roasted trumpet mushrooms, bearnaise, beet bordelaise, caramelized onion, and watercress - and the Sonoma petite sirah - and you have one fine entree to round out the savory portion of the meal. I ate as slowly as possible with this one.  The fifth and final course was a chocolate souffle cake, with pistachio butter, blackberry vin cotto, sea salt, and EVOO, paired with an aperitif wine that came off like an Italian whiskey. Chocolate executed at this level with yet another fine pairing? This girl was floating in ecstasy somewhere high above the table....  Before I conclude, let me mention that our main server, Cass, as well as all other servers who attended to us during our meal, brought grace, knowledge, impeccable timing, and good cheer to our table with every visit. The professionalism of Cure's service and the quality of the food and wine (and curation of the menu) made it easy for me to deal with what was probably the most expensive meal of my life. It's important to note, again, that this was a special event night and that we could have never ordered this combination on our own and at that price for five courses with pairings.  This meal, in its entirety, was like going to a long anticipated concert of your favorite band: When you eat at Cure, from the first bite, you know that you will never have this same meal again; that you must take your time to enjoy every moment; and, that you will leave in a state of bliss that stays repeating on your palette for days, much the same as the lyrics to your very favorite song.  Bravo, Cure!  (P.S. I *can't wait* to try Morcilla!)",

The place is pretty nice but not too fancy to the point of wearing a cocktail dress or a suit. The service was great; the waiters were really helpful in explaining what went into our dishes and giving suggestions. Started off with World Peas cocktail and Daisy cocktail... Both were great and light! Small Salumi board as an appetizer was just right for 2. We really liked the violet mustard spread. I'm biased to anything Duck related so I loved the duck slices. I ordered the duck entree and it was phenomenal. My friend ordered the Veal Cheek which had salt & pepper and this horseradish sauce that paired with it perfectly... The veal was so tender it melted in your mouth. Overall GREAT experience and would go again.",

We ended up choosing the small salumi board, bruleed chevre, beef tartare, duck, and trout. We brought our own wine; corkage is $20.  The salumi was great. I wish there had been more than one slice of bread for the two of us but it was about the meats, so I get it. The duck speck was my favorite. Everything was so rich and perfectly seasoned.  The snacks were delicious as well. The beef is served as a diy lettuce wrap, so there is a fresh, vibrant component in addition to the very savory beef and egg. The babka that the chevre was sitting on was almost worth the price of the dish alone. This snack was practically a dessert.  The trout was very good. I have never seen beans done like that before- fried crispy on the outside. The duck was completely fabulous. The skin was crispy and the meat just fell apart under the fork. The accoutrements with the duck were also delightful with my husband saying he liked the \"little flavor bombs,\" ie, blistered grapes.  Dessert was a chocolate truffle cake with pistachio butter and raspberry vin cotto that evoked a PBJ made with chocolate cake. The cake was very moist but tasted a little extra toasty on the outside. I had the flip cocktail at dessert as well and I wish I had the recipe.  Overall, we really enjoyed our dinner. It's fine dining food despite the rustic decor, and the portion sizes are small so you can try lots of different things. Definitely a special occasion place. I'm glad we have places like this in pgh!",

We were willing to go with a fresh new perspective. However, the same qualms we had the first time were accentuated this time around. Most noticeably, this time we were also disappointed in the food. Out of the four dishes we tried, the NY Strip was the dish that stood out the most. Indeed, the medium rare cook was done to perfection. That being said, being continually asked if we were done while food was still on our plates was simply frustrating and detracted from the dinning experience as a whole.",

It was an awesome experience, we chose the menu with the beverage pairing.  All of the snacks were an interesting experience. The oyster, smoked sockeye salmon and beef tartare were a nice starter. It was followed by swordfish finocchiona and salmon nudja. Lardo, Macaron and Lyonnaise Potato were next. We have never had lyonnaise potatoes like that, so very different. The macaron included foie blonde, it did not taste like foie, a nice change. A coddled egg was next, not my favorite, only because I dislike runny eggs. Green Garlic and Dandelions Soup came with a fried egg on top, but , no it did not look like the usual fried egg. The salad  \"Who cooks for you farm salad \"was nice and crunchy, a lovely tasting salad. The Veal Cheek was a nice sized portion, not overwhelming, lovely and succulent could not ask for more tender gnocchi pillows. The two desserts were Bruleed Goat Rodeo Chevre and Black Olive Madeleines Olive Oil Ice Cream with Strawberry pate de fruit. Olive oil ice cream was creamy and went quite well with the madeleines. Parking for the restaurant is a little challenging, however it is worth it . The wait staff is extremely attentive but not over bearing.",

    "text": "We went to Cure for the first time last night and it was overall a very nice dinner.  Just a few things to note... coming from NYC, I'm used to expensive, smaller portions, and this has both that, so that wasn't a surprise, although it would have been nice, with a restaurant of this quality, buzz and notoriety (not just in the Burgh) to be given some kind of nice amuse bouche, just to say we're glad you're here and we know you're gonna like this meal.  It's a classy touch and there was none of that.  No small bread offerings or anything else.  A couple weird things with the service too.  We were there on a Tuesday night so while it was crowded, it wasn't packed and there were a few empty tables.  Once we finished our cocktails, barely, the wait staff kept buzzing by to whisk the empties away, and in fact, came by again while we were waiting to pay the check, to start clearing the table, which I found sort of uncomfortable and not reflective of great service.  We'd been there for maybe a little over an hour, so not long, and there were people still there from when we arrived when we left.  But it was like they were saying, \"OK, you need to leave now.\"  It's little things that make you OK with spending a lot of money on food, service being #1.  So delicious food, but not a particularly gracious or generous spirit, at least not the night we went.",

I was slightly disappointed that several of the meats tasted as though they had been cut early that morning or the day before.  Still very good though.  The entrees were mouthwatering.  Shortrib gnocchi and hangar steak.  The steaks were all a bit underdone at our table- we requested them medium but they were still cool in the center.  Not a big deal for us but could be a bit more of a problem if you are particular about that.  The ambiance is great and our server was attentive, although a little behind as he had too many tables.  Overall a great experience but just a little short of ideal with the minor inconsistencies that I would not expect from a restaurant of this caliber.",

    "text": "Cure is charming: the food is gorgeous and incredibly delicious, and everything is served in a relaxed, casual, even festive atmosphere that can almost make you forget that dinner for two will set you back a pretty penny.  Is it worth it? If you want food that's both thoughtful and really well-prepared without an ounce of pretension, yes. I had the goat tartare, which was a great balance of sweet and sour, fresh and crunchy - yet surprisingly light, and my husband had what Cure was calling Spring, with morels and grilled ramps, along with pomegranate and a \"slow egg.\"  Both were delicious, and surprising, which I think is an important thing - when you're paying a premium and you're not at a steakhouse, you want the unexpected.  Then, I took a risk and ordered the roast chicken with coffee and cracked wheat gnocchi - there was nothing ordinary about this chicken, and it came with more grilled ramps, and pickled cabbage, both delicious.  My husband had the pork belly and squab, which was unctuous and tender - very decadent, and the sumac yogurt and falafel added sweet and crunchy textures that made the dish really special.  You might be tempted to skip dessert after all that, but order the chocolate souffle, served with a savory pistachio puree and a balsamic reduction - topped with sea salt, it's sweet and unusual, just like Cure itself.  By the time you read this, they should have a full bar - when we ate there on 4/21, it was the last night of BYOB.",

    "text": "Horrendous Service. Never visting this place again. Yes my friends and I were 10-15 minutes late for reservation. We called 20 minutes beforehand to say we would be down 2 to the reservation and would be ten minutes late. We came in, purchased appetizers, entrees, dessert, and opened 3 bottles of wine and 4 bottles of beer (each beer bottle cost $3 to cork, talk about overpriced!). Closing in on two hours and 15 minutes, we were told we needed to leave soon because we had spent too much time. Finishing up our remaining glasses, we were quickly told \"sorry, we need this table. you need to leave.\" Isn't that restaurant no-no number 1? Never ask patrons to leave? How sad. I've never had this happen to me in any previous restaurant experience. After getting out of our table, my roommate went to a friend who happened to be visiting at another table and stated \"feel free to tip as little as you want, they just kick you out\". Yeah, not the BEST thing to say, but come on, his statement would have never occurred had they not rudely asked us to leave. After that, the manager told the owner how \"rude\" we were being, and he came over to tell us to leave. He said he was sorry, but that he had to side with his manager. Funny enough he finished his statement with \"the big one was being rude\" (side note- in any outing I will always be pinned as the \"big one\") when I was doing nothing, merely laughing in the corner because I'm a sucker for horrendously awkward situations. At this point another friend was talking to a different friend (hope you're not lost yet, and you've made it all the way down here!) about how good the food was, when the owner said \"you need to leave, stop talking to them.\" When my friend protested he was only catching up with a friend and telling him about the food, the owner responded with \"you need to leave now\". Dang, where did common courtesy go? Eventually we left, but not without a sour taste in my mouth. I wrote on their Facebook wall and how disgusted I was at how we were treated. And guess what. Within five minutes I was banned and my comment deleted (talk about service! maybe they needed that in their own establishment). Overall thoroughly disappointed with how the whole situation was treated.  PS- Salt of the Earth is better. Just saying...",

Because the dishes are so innovative, occasionally something \" misses the mark for me\" but about 9 out of 10 dishes have been fantastic. The menu is always changing but the charcuterie plate is a staple- and must have. The steak tartare preparation changes frequently but is usually phenomenal. The desserts are also epic - the blueberry soup I had last year had such a powerful blueberry flavor, it actually made me realize I like the fruit! Always love to see what they are cooking up at cure!",

We had the beef tartar and the asparagus to start. The beef was excellent, everything that I would want to taste ever, all in one bite... Excellent. The asparagus was very good.  My boyfriend had the risotto and I had the duck which were both grand slams. The risotto was with some sort of cheese we can't remember, braised pork shoulder and crispy kale.. So yummy.  My duck was cooked med-rare (perfectly) skin on and crispy with pok choy and I think quinoa.  There was also a celery sauce with smashed apricots. We split the strawberry, rhubarb, and lemon curd orgasmic perfection for dessert, enough said there.  There were a lot of different flavors but it was never overwhelming.  All around very very yummy.  BYOB definitely a plus. We made it outa there with a 5 star meal in our bellies for around 80 bucks before tip, and very full.  The service was great too, they seem to share a lot of the responsibilities and everyone cares about you.  Our server Gretchen, also let us know about their brunch menu which is $35 a person and offers your choice of a starter a main and a dessert. Plus they supply OJ and bloody Mary mix. They also let us know about their pig carving demonstration/ dinner nights. Very cool idea for foodies and we will be going to one of these after eating here.  I would and will definitely recommend this place to the people who are advenurous with food.",

The minuses: entrees were too salty; lacked a balance of flavors.  I had heard the spaghetti carbonara was too salty so I tried the wild nettle & goat cheese ravioli. It was smothered in pulled pork in a tomato based sauce that just was a bit too salty and heavy. The balance of pasta and sauce is also not quite right.  There is nothing green and the meat and salt overwhelms in several entrees.  Would expect more for the price",

    "text": "My parents were in this weekend visiting from Chicago and I thought that would be the perfect opportunity to FINALLY try Cure... a worthy match-up against the feasts they are privy to on a regular basis in a city with many more culinary offerings.  It didn't take any convincing when I told them that it was named by Bon Appetit as one of the top 50 new restaurants in the US this year AND of course features meat, meat, and more meat.  Plus, I have been quite the salivating green-eyed monster ever since my boyfriend ate here over the summer, which I sadly missed due to being away on a free beach vacation (i know, life is rough around these parts).  Anyway, it definitely lived up to its expectations.  If anyone doesn't feel like reading the long descriptions ahead, the one thing that you need to know about Cure is that literally every bite you will eat there is packed with the most amazingly rich and well thought-out flavors you could imagine.  Go there. Now.  Read on for ramblings cause I like to re-live my meals through reviews.  We started with the large salumi platter.  Our waitress took the time to carefully go through each component on the board to tell us what we would be sampling.  After one bite I completely forgot everything she said, but it was okay because I didn't care what I was eating I just knew it was delicious.  Three of the four of us shared the platter, while my mom opted for a beet salad.  While I would typically always choose meat over vegetables, I have to say that the salad was also amazing.  There were beets that were smoked, roasted, and pickled along with some kind of foam (pear maybe?), blue cheese something or other, and a hazelnut brittle with the nuts burnt just a little bit for a deep and earthy flavor. YUM.  As for the salumi plate, my dad, boyfriend, and i had no problem devouring everything on it.  And then came the entrees.  I don't think I have ever spoken so few words in one meal I was so preoccupied with what was on my plate.  I ordered the squab, which came served with a rosemary something or other sausage over spiced red cabbage and a butternut squash sauce with vanilla and orange in it with smoked walnuts.  Every bite I took of this dish I just wanted to keep eating more and more.  Each part of it was amazing on its own, but combined brought me to a spiritual place- the holy trinity of food right there on my plate.  I could go on and on about the food but I will stop myself.  I will share that the entrees around the rest of the table were equally as good-- boyfriend got a tagine of goat with red currants and amazingness, dad got gnocci with tripe and sausage, and mom got veal cheeks with pork belly and crispy kale.  We were all stuffed by dessert but based on the rest of the meal decided we had to order it anyway (of course).  We shared a super tasty creamed ricotta something or other and a dark chocolate souffle with pistachio butter topped with sea salt.  I usually don't care about dessert, but I could eat nothing but that cake all day every day and be a happy girl.  Again, I am not sure if I mentioned but the entire meal was AMAZING.  That combined with the BYOB with reasonable corkage fee (I think $3 a bottle) and there is no reason to go anywhere else, really.  I think I spent just as much trying to enjoy a mediocre meal plenty of other places around the Burgh (won't name those places here will just have to conjure up some reviews for them).  Only one complaint at all- and that is that the restaurant is VERY loud.  Our table of four was small enough that, while a bit strained at times, we could hear one other, but any larger of a group and we would have been forced into that awkward situation where you have 2 or 3 mini conversations going on and someone that one person at the middle of the table can't figure out which conversation they are supposed to be part of and spends the evening wasting mental energy trying to keep up with what happened on the Kardashians this week to the left and why we should all be glad Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson didn't have any children on the right with some talk about the fact that Paul Ryan looks kind of like Gabe from the Office straight ahead-- it can all become so exhausting that you forget how good the food is!",

Service was slow to get going but was attentive and non-intrusive throughout.  ------ \"Stir it up.. ba ba buhm. Little darlin' \" \"Stir it up.. ba ba buhm. Little darlin' \" ------  Cocktails were VERY solid.. not 5/5 but definitely up there. The smoky mezcal was low on the promised citrus, and stiff bourbon had little blueberry to back it. Quality and boozy but not enough balance.  ------ \"Come crawling faster\" \"Obey your master\" \"Your life burns faster\" \"Obey your master\" \"Master\" ------  What!? Cure's channel plays the Doors, Bob Marley, and Metallica. What kind of station is this?The food was equally mixed..  The delicious, well-rounded charcuterie is the most colorful I've seen. Taste the rainbow: RED salumi and duck speck are hearty, salty ORANGE pimenton aioli cuts the fat spicy YELLOW mustard adds dryness  CREAMY cheese smooths all bitter GREEN charred asparagus and PURPLE beets + pate. Bread was mediocre.  The muddled tartare had little meat flavor and was drowning in spice that stings your tongue. Good chips alongside. The chicharrones were crisp but inedibly salty.. half our dish sent back.  All three half-plate pastas looked like vomit in the bowl. They tasted way better though. The well-salted carbonara had a med-hard egg but the pork bits were too large/chewy. The saly garganelli was very soupy, al-dente noodles floating. The parisian gnocchi was SMALL. 7--count em--7 gnocchi for $13. A light fried texture with a heavy pork and pine-nut note. Very tasty but very pricey.  The kabocha squash soup was probably the best dish of the night.  Morcilla is too salty/spiced and not earthy enough but with excellent. The smoked mozzerella foam is delish and the rich squash rich slurp-worthy.",

Main course was the big issue. I ordered the pork tenderloin, which was very fatty, but if this is the way it should be served, so be it. However the pork was very tough and chewy and difficult to cut with a steak knife! Frankly, I've made tenderloin at home that was better. In retrospect, I should have sent it back, but we were entertaining out-of-town guests so I didn't want to make a big deal about it  Less of an issue - although the pasta was good, the portions were very small.",

The salumi plate was fantastic as everyone mentioned. But personally I liked the duck even more. The duck breast was so juicy and crispy outside w just the right portion of duck fat inside! Looooove it! My steak was a little salty but still good. The best part of the steak entree were potatoes going with the meat, full of soft layers inside the tasting of bacon! Everything was soooo yummy! We had the chocolate souffle cake and the banana creme brulee. Oh gee what more can I say, perfect and amazing! The ginger crunches going w the banana creme brulee were kinda strange. But the creme brulee was frozen and sooooo banana-ish and had caramelled banana pieces on it! Great restaurant!",

My friends have been talking about coming here and I finally got reservations for my husband's birthday. We started with the salumi and beets, beets, beets & beets, it's a perfect starter with some cocktails or a pinot noir. The 8 of us were able to share this nicely with bits of duck, beef, pork, pate... so many things on the plate. Then I went onto the duck confit. The flavor and tenderness of the meat on the duck was AWESOME and so good, however, it was a little too salty for me. It paired nicely with the golden raisins and grains on the plate. The food runner was great about explaining all the parts and flavors in the dishes.  The only upsetting part was our waitress. She didn't seem to be in the mood to help us or serve us. It was a late seating, so there weren't that many tables she had to overlook. We were done with our appetizers and hadn't ordered our meals and she was nowhere to be found. I kept flagging down other waiters to order second drinks. This part was extremely frustrating, PLUS the music was really loud to yell across the restaurant to grab someone's attention. I also left my card to pay for the meal with the hostess as it was a big party. When we finally got her attention again for the check, she brought it without the card. I had to remind her about that. It's not exactly a cheap restaurant and I had expected the service to be a little better than that.",

This time, we hit the SALUMI plate (to die for...), the tartare (mouth watering and delicious - the celery foam and caramelized onion confit perfectly matched the dish!), and split the Gluttony entree (splitting this one is a perfect amount of food once you've feasted on the two other dishes listed above.  Read my original review if you want the details - this is an affirmation that Cure can deliver perfectly executed dishes consistently...  Once again, I felt that the Draai Laag Aurora was the perfect pairing for the food; my wife enjoyed a mixed drink from the bar - it was delicious.  I am very eager to follow this restaurant's evolution through the seasons, as this really is one of my all-time favorite places I've ever eaten at; formal or informal. It's just that good!

Dinner: I had the duck breast and leg which was so Very good, I was tempted to lick the plate. lol Others in our group had Heritage Farm Chicken, Black Cod, Meyer Ranch Hangar (steak) and Parisian Gnocchi. We all shared, everything was wonderful and no one was considered the better in ordering.  Dessert - We order a couple Dark Chocolate Souffle cakes to share and again tipping up and licking the plate was talked about as we fought for the privilege to pass our  spoon across the plate one more time for that last bit of pistachio butter.  Drinks: I had the warm Toddy which was very nice for such a cold evening. Another at our table ordered the Cobbler which has smoked maple in it. We all thought it tasted like drinking beef jerky - unfortunately the only flavor which stood out was the smoke and after one little taste by each at the table, no one wanted to keep drinking it so the relatively full glass was later collected to be thrown away. (I did not try any of the other drinks ordered by our table so will not write a review of them.)  I highly recommend Cure to all you meat lovers who want to try something new. Advance reservations are recommended as they are a small cozy place and reservations fill up fast - because, yes, the food is that good!",

We brought a bottle of wine (BYOB!) and enjoyed that over the large charcuterie board. The only qualm I have was that the server kept pushing us to order entrees even though we had already handed back the menus. We did enjoy a dessert in lieu of entree and everything was fantastic.",

I was given the menu, which was a bizarre plank of wood with paper banded around it, and immediately thought that this was one of those charges-thirty-bucks-for-a-portion-the-size- of-my-fist places. I was proven wrong.  The portions were pretty big and filling. We got the Laurel Hill Farms Smoked Trout, Eichner Farns Chicken, Lake Ontario Walleyed Pike, and Dark Chocolate Souffle Cake. Each dish was prepared with aesthetic appeal in mind and didn't miss the mark on taste either.    My favorite was probably the Smoked Trout, where it was decadent and quite unique.  I never had anything like it before, the sauces and texture of the fish are indescribable all I recommend is that you try it.    Overall this place did not disappoint, but if you're a vegetarian, you're not going to have much luck here - the entrees were meat ridden.",

The restaurant itself is small but has a lot of character, I especially liked the taxidermied boar heads on the far wall of the restaurant. First, we ordered a bread appetizer. I kid you not, this was the best bread and butter combination I have ever had...As a starter we ordered the the large salumi plate, which in a word was EXCEPTIONAL! The plate itself looked more like art than food, and each cut of meat was seemingly better than the last. It was obviously made from the freshest possible products. Then, we got an order of oysters, I didn't have any but those whom did partake enjoyed them immensely. The next course that came out was bruleed halloumi with a golden beer tahini and Concord grape malawach... it was perfectly executed! Along with the halloumi came Nantucket Bay scallop crudo with a roasted watermelon conserva. I don't even like seafood but this was pretty darn tasty. Now on to the entres. For the entres we order three dishes, first, ricotta gnudi with pecorino Romano and perigord truffle, this was probably the best thing I ate at this restaurant, so tasty! Second we ordered burnt wheat tagliatelle featuring braised duck and cabbage ragout. I enjoyed the tagliatelle but to be perfectly honest it wasn't my favorite dish of the night. For our third entree we ordered the albacore tuna which I didn't try but heard good things of from those who did. For desert I had an amazing Dark Chocolate Souffle Cake featuring pistachio butter, concord grape must, cara cara orange, evoo and sea salt.. MARVELOUS!! All in all my experience at cure was nothing short of exceptional!",

I started off my meal with the Bourbon cocktail (bourbon (obvi.) pinot noir / quince / orange blossom), which got me started off on the right foot to be wowed.  We shared for the table: Bread & Butter - a kind of unremarkable focaccia that was handy to have around as no other bread was provided Heirloom Tomatoes - a real show stopper, the cucumber yogurt, falafel crumble, and mint foam were tasty and beautifully presented Small Salumi plate - nduja, duck speck (the best), sopressatta, and duck rillettes  I looked over at others' tables and was jealous of their large salumi plates - the 4 that we had were pretty good, but I bet the full selection would have been off the hook.  For my entree, I had the La Bella Farm Duck, which was both beautiful and tasty. The breast was cooked perfectly, and the duck confit pancake was not at all what I would have expected, but it was really great. The blueberry, turnip, swiss chard, and smoked baby beets rounded off the dish perfectly. My fellow diners also enjoyed the pork belly, which was awesome with the kimchi and runny egg which, quite frankly, made it taste like the perfect plate of delicious breakfast.  The atmosphere was relaxed and charming. If I lived in town, I think Cure would be a great place for a date or a special occasion.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that maybe I was looking forward to this meal too much.  I and some friends of mine have been planning this meal at Cure since July.  The wife part of the couple is a foodie like me, however, the husband could care less.  So reservations were made months ago and lost.  My friends currently reside in New Mexico, so it wasn't like we could wait until the following week.  Fortunately, we were placed on a waiting list and able to get in Friday, November 28.  We decided to order \"snacks\" and ordered the salumi platter and pork rinds.  Both snacks were fantastic.  You can't go wrong with freshly made pork rinds and everything on the salumi platter was wonderful.  The duck speck and the nduja were my favorites, along with the toasted crostini with lardo. Nduja is a spicy spreadable pork sausage.  Come on man!  Spreadable pork sausage?  Yummy!  My only complaint with the platter was that we were only given three or four crostini for all of that meat and spreads.  However, when we asked for additional crostini, it was provided immediately. Now on to the sad part... I understand the idea behind \"chef-centric\" restaurants.  Chefs have a certain vision as to how they want their food to be savored.  I get that.  I would be mad too if I saw a meal that I had worked hard on envisioning/developing/cooking only to find that someone poured an entire bottle of ketchup over the whole thing to suit their taste.  However, I don't think that it's too much to ask that a certain spice or flavor be eliminated from a dish.  I wanted to order the Heritage Farms Chicken Breast and Confit, however, I noticed that lavender was listed as one of the ingredients.   I'm sorry, I just don't like floral notes in my food.  Rose water flavored desserts, lavender, blah, blah, blah.  I politely asked our hostess if I could place an order for the chicken, but without the lavender.  She quickly informed me that she would ask, however, because the restaurant was chef-centric she doubted that I would be accommodated.  Hunh?  She proceeded to take my friend's orders and departed to the kitchen.  About 5 minutes later, the hostess came back and informed me that the chefs are unwilling to remove the lavender from the dish and that they would only remove it due to allergies.  Hunh? Okay! I decided to order smaller portions of two pasta dishes...the Spaghetti Carbonara and the Parisian Gnocchi.  My friend ordered the Bratwurst served with spaetzle, fried eggs, cabbage, dill creme fraiche and mustard greens.  My other friend ordered the Chicken Breast and Confit because she said that she didn't mind the lavender.  So, after chatting, I excuse myself to the restroom.  Upon my departure from the restroom, I see what appears to be my meal ready for pick-up in the kitchen.  Sure enough, my friends' meals have  arrived and they said that the hostess would return with my meal.  To be fair, my meal arrived tableside shortly after I sat down. Now here is the tricky part, somehow both of my dishes were lukewarm.  The Spaghetti Carbonara had a good flavor, but since it was lukewarm, I couldn't get the egg to emulsify into the sauce.  So instead of having a rich carbonara sauce with salty bits of pork and peas, I had lukewarm pasta with egg clots.  The Parisian Gnocchi that I ordered was served with smoked beef brisket, San Marzano tomato sauce and ricotta.  Again, lukewarm pasta.  In my humble opinion, a well-made sauce should not have one flavor which overwhelms everything else.  All I got from the sauce was a tomato \"paste\" flavor and not really a tomato \"sauce\" flavor.    With regards to my friends' meals, we each tasted food from each others plates.  I tasted the chicken and as I thought, the lavender was too intense for my taste.  However, it had tasty sweet potatoes, sweet and sour kale and a preserved Meyer lemon sauce.  Now my other friend ordered the Bratwurst and he said that it didn't taste like much.  His wife and I were like, \"You are not a food connoisseur like us and you don't know what you're talking about.\" You know what?  He was absolutely right!  For a place that specializes in house made meats and charcuterie, the bratwurst that night was almost flavorless.  Tender?  Yes!  Not overly greasy? Check!  Flavorful?  Not really!  What a letdown after a fabulous salumi platter. As for the spaetzle and other accompaniments, they were just meh. Nothing to write home about...not that much seasoning or anything else. His wife and I couldn't believe that he was right.   We were seated in a window booth not far from the door and I don't usually pay attention to drafts, however, Friday night was a little chilly.  Our service was okay and the hostess was friendly and knowledgeable.  Overall, a disappointing experience.  I hate to say that. I have read so many good things about Chef Justin Severino and I'm glad that he makes the Pittsburgh area his home base.  We're honored.  I just wish that me and my friends meals were better Friday.",

    "text": "This place tries just a little too hard. Every plate shouldn't have to have a dozen elements to be pleasing to the palate. Beet salad was excellent although a miniscule portion. Veal cheek was interesting and tasty. The foam makes for a grand presentation but is practically tasteless. I get the whole cure concept but does every plate need to be accompanied by some fat laden sausage/pork belly? You are obviously catering to the hipster crowd who wouldn't recognize a cardiologist if she hit them over the head. Chocolate souffle cake was excellent as well but lose the pistachio butter. It is that kind of nut butter that unpleasantly sucks all the moisture out of your mouth. Paw paw semifreddo was great but again, trying too hard.",

    "text": "We went here Saturday night for my husband's birthday and the food is outstanding!! This restaurant should have all 5 stars but the service however was horrible. So horrible that we left after our entrees because it wasn't worth trying to get our waitress's attention to order dessert or drinks. We made reservations for 8:30 and we got there early and the hostess suggested we get drinks at the wine bar next door. It was a nice place and we came back at 8:30, seated at 8:40 which was no big deal. Our waitress came over somewhat quickly and I asked her for Pinot Noir, she said they didn't have that but recommended one that was similar. It was awful and tasted like white Zinfandel and was pink in color. I was hoping to get a different glass but she took our food order so quickly and left I never got the chance. Yes, she took our orders and that was the last time she came to our table until after we finished our meals. We got the Salumi, which was the best charcuterie I have ever had! This was brought by a very nice gentlemen who was obviously not our waitress. Then when our meals came out, they were also brought out by a nice gentlemen. The 1 drink each that we were able to order were cleared by another waitress who I think felt bad for us. When our waitress finally came back to our table and we asked for our check she didn't bother to apologize for never checking on us or getting us drinks or to check on the awful wine she recommended. I ordered the duck which was unbelievably good and my husband got the osso bucco which was also great! We would have loved to had a couple drinks and order dessert because we have two kids and had a night out and we were celebrating a birthday but there was no way we were staying and trying to get service from our non existent waitress. She finally brought a check which was not ours and double the amount of what our bill ended up being. I brought this to her attention and again, no apology. She just huffed and took it away and came back with the right check. Needless to say we went somewhere else for drinks and dessert. It's a shame because the food was top notch and I will dream of the duck. Not sure if I want to brave it again though if the service stays the same.",

Since they are no longer BYOB, we bought two bottles of wine and would have preferred some more affordable choices. The menu also seemed overpriced. Among four of us, we had the salumi, roast chicken, sweet pea ravioli, wall-eyed pike, the squab and the chicken breast with chorizo. The presentation of the dishes was beautiful and the food was all good. One of our guests wanted a salad, but doesn't like goat cheese and they wouldn't make it for her, without.  I understand \"no substitutions\", but that seemed a bit ridiculous.  The place is attractive, but the high tin ceiling makes the acoustics terrible.  The noise level is very high and it's hard to converse. We eat out regularly and love many local places...Ave B, Spoon, Salt to name a few.  We won't be headed back to Cure. It was good, but nothing memorable.",

    "text": "Everyone has their own idea about what \"fine dining\" means.  For me, its where both the food and the service contribute equally to the dining experience.  Enter Cure.  Nothing better than being dressed in a pair of jeans (OK, designer jeans) and a tee, and enjoying a thoughtfully prepared and executed meal.  And in conjunction with that awesome food,  the service doesn't miss a beat.    Lawrenceville is the mecca for Pittsburgh's burgeoning restaurant business.  While I was only visiting, this neighborhood is clearly the hipster hangout.  Couldn't think of a better neighborhood for this terrific expansion to the Burgh dining scene.    While the menu does spotlight the things that carnivores covet,  there are more than enough offerings for vegetarians & pescatarians ( I was there with both)   The charcuterie sampler with homemade salumis,  cured meat and an awesome nduja is served with house made mustards and pickles.     Two varieties of raw oysters were were displayed on ice with fresh seaweed  and mignonette.   Our vegetarians ordered roasted beets  with lemon labneh and the \"bread & butter\" which came with roasted garlic  and some fried rosemary.  It also was served with whipped & spiced lard ( which us carnivores devoured)   They also ordered squid ink paparadelle, with a lobster bolognese.  The sauce had been reduced to within an inch of its life, and  tasted of the coral shells, and aromatic veggies.   Spanish Mackerel -- was perfectly grilled and served alongside white beans, and a spicy celery type pickle. And last , but certainly not least,  Pork on Pork on Pork ( a must for any pork lover)   The team service approach was impeccable.  The hostess helped clear dishes as well as sat patrons. One might expect this type of service in a pricey restaurant, not a laid back, neighborhood, reasonably priced place like Cure.  Fresh silverware with each course, food came for entire table at once. Server and kitchen perfectly paced the meal , and our server explained the food on the plates, making it appetizing.  The kitchen is open , and you can see the professionalism as small portions of sauce were being prepared to order.   Cure runs like a well oiled machine.  You will be glad you came here.",

    "text": "A vegetarian at Cure, an unlikely love affair: As a vegetarian, I had been foolishly ignoring Cure despite it being on multiple lists of trendy places to try in Pittsburgh. I thought there was no way it would cater to my dietary restriction based mainly on the name and concept, and also because it sort of smells like prosciutto inside. So when the opportunity to join some friends came up last Wednesday, I agreed to go simply to try out some of the drinks and see how they liked it. I had no idea I would be in for one of the best entrees I've ordered off a menu in a long time!   One thing I immediately loved about this place is that their menu allows for half and whole portions for most of the items. Perfect for all different scenarios- you usually don't finish a whole entree, you like eating half and taking leftovers, you like sharing multiple entrees without wasting, etc. Its all covered when you're able to manipulate your portion size. Great feature.   We started with a half order of the Bread and Butter which was great for three not-super-hungry people who were in the mood for a snack but nothing too heavy. The hunk of focaccia that came was fresh and delicious. My friends enjoyed the whipped lard spread while I loved on the olive tapenade. When it came to entrees I was surprised at how badly I wanted to try one of the pasta dishes, despite coming under the assumption that I wouldn't be eating. I took a half order of the Ricotta Gnudi and was blown away. A generous portion of buttery truffles were sprinkled on top of delectable homemade (??) gnudi and the pecorino blended in was the perfect final touch.   To be honest, this is one of the best entrees I have had the pleasure of consuming in Pittsburgh. The half order would have been the perfect size for a full dinner, but I took a little home to enjoy the next day and didn't regret it. Definitely one of the pricier options on the pasta side of things, likely because of the truffles, but absolutely worth it. For what it's worth, I would highly recommend this dish to vegetarians and meat eaters alike.   And to all the vegetarians out there like me, who felt a bit awkward about walking into a meat-centered dining experience, I hope this debunks your fears!",

I ordered the trout, which was cooked perfectly, but the main flavor of the dish was salt, with the secondary being bitter. It was literally one of the worse fish dishes I've ever had.

I wish I could have tried everything on the menu, but my favorite from what I sampled was the beef tartar. It's served with lettuce wraps and salt and vinegar chips to put on top. All the flavors complimented each other perfectly. I'm 100% recommending Cure to any friends that visit.",

The oysters were delicious and I really enjoyed them. However, the pork dish was a little too rare for me. I'm not used to eating medium-rare pork, and even though it was pretty good taste-wise, the texture was unappealing to me. I really had to slice the pork multiple times with the knife to cut the pieces apart (due to the stringy and rare texture), and honestly, at about ~$50 per person for just the oysters and the entree, I'm not sure I'd go back.",

My friend and I were so obsessed with the small salumi we had last time that this time we ordered the large salumi. And we finished it all. Please don't judge us. Actually, I don't care. It's worth the judgement. This is a charcuterie fanatic's wet dream. The duck speck and the lardo are just ridiculously good, and thankfully those seem to be two of the staples that stick around on the menu. Even the pates were delicious, and I really am not a pate person.  We also got a salad, because that cancels out the fact that we just ate a table full of fatty meat (shush, it's sound logic). It had cinnamon croutons and bleu cheese and some other stuff. It kinda tasted like Christmas. I was into it.  We also got a main course to share. I know, I'm not sure why we thought this was a good idea. It was wayyy too much food! Next time I will (attempt to) control myself, but questionable decisions aside, I would have been super sad to have missed out on the cider-braised veal cheeks. Even better than the pork sampler I had the first time I was here, with the same simple, unpretentious style. Nothing fancy, just a whole roasted baby onion and some crispy kale leaves and an impeccably cooked piece of meat.  There's honestly nothing I dislike at Cure, besides the fact that getting in can be difficult on the weekend. I was turned away as a walk-in several times before finally planning ahead and making a reservation. But it's worth it!",

There are limited AC vents which cannot accommodate the crowd.  The couples beside us were both complaining about the heat when we sat down.  As the heat continued to rise, we decided to leave after the appetizer - 10 bites of cheese for $14!  We explained our discomfort to the waiter who told us there was nothing to be done - it is HOT on a hot day.  We left with 2/3 of our wine and paid the hefty corkage fee.  Since they don't make the cheese, they can't really take credit for it. So I can't rate the taste of the food, just the discomfort and overpricing.",

The Pigs ears Salad contained no Pigs Ears--surprising for a place that boasts it pork products. Then the Hostess or Maitre D had the audacity to ask for the table so , they could turn it over.

    "text": "I went here last Sunday with my wife and we had one of the best meals we've had all year (and it's been a great year of eating).  Cure is the type of cozy, on-trend, local, seasonal etc. etc. type restaurant that you are seeing in most cities big and small across North America, but unlike a lot of its peers Cure backs up its style with a whole bunch of substance and the kind of laid back good vibes atmosphere that you can't help but love.   Now, we didn't try any of the charcuterie which is apparently good (and represents the place's namesake) but when you look at how interesting and constantly changing the menu of cooked dishes is, I can't rationalize ordering the charcuterie plate as good as it may be.  To start I got the heirloom tomato salad with pickled grapes, burnt onions, balsamic zabaglione, dill, taleggio fondant and really good crumbled sour dough. It was interesting, beautifully presented and successfully pulled together the really fresh produce very, very well.  My wife started with the fava bean and ricotta ravioli, which had an amazing tarragon pesto. The flavours were subtle (in a good way), the pasta was very well cooked and again the dish was really well plated.   For my main I had the hanger steak with smoked crispy potatoes, maple glazed carrots and maitake mushrooms. The components were meant to be eaten at the same time and they came together into this beautifully smokey, super manly dish that reminded me of cooking meals over a fire while camping. The smoked goat cheese that also accompanied the steak was interesting but not really necessary to the enjoyment of the dish. I only had a bit of mine but people that like goat cheese will probably go nuts for it.   My wife had the meat plate which came with a very rare, and super delicious squab breast, roasted pork belly and duck confit. These were all well cooked but the highlight was the middle-eastern spiced chickpea fritter, which on the menu seemed a little out of place in the dish, but on the plate was both delicious and surprising and actually tied in the meats quite well.   For dessert I had the blueberry soup, which was served with house made granola and a panna cotta. I wanted to like this but it was frankly just too sour, and it was the only miss on the menu. My advice would be to scale back the amount of the soup relative to the amount of panna cotta and I think you'll be left with a really fresh summery dessert.  My wife had the the chocolate souffle, which was light and fluffy and generally pretty textbook. It came with a very tasty pistachio butter and a few drops of vincotto (which is a thick, sweet Italian condiment that is made from reducing grape must and tastes like very rich balsamic but is not a vinegar). It was delicious.  Drinks-wise, cocktails were truly stellar, especially the one with bourbon and blackberry. Beer selection was interesting and reasonably priced.  Coffee was a bit weak, but overall decent.  The only other miss at this place was the wine list which was bizarrely priced relative to the menu and to the other drinks on offer (by-the-glass offerings were $12-15 and most decent bottles started in the high 60's). I would like to see this place get some decent cheaper wine options and to expand offerings on the new world cool climate wines (Oregon, New Zealand, upstate New York, Ontario) that are becoming increasingly recognized and which would in my opinion pair well with the type of food being served.  All in all, this was a great food experience and I will most certainly be back. I encourage Pittsburgh residents and tourists alike to check this place out and stick around to see all of the really cool things that are happening in surrounding Lawrenceville before or after dinner.   I wish the owners of Cure great success, they truly deserve it.  Rating: 4.5/5 - but this could easily be a 5 with a better wine list and tighter dessert offering.   -Brian   PS - for visitors to Pittsburgh, you may want to drive out here or arrange a private car (only slightly more expensive than a cab) beforehand as it is a real pain to get taxis to come outside of the city core on a busy night.",

    "text": "After months of wanting to try Cure I was finally able to convince some friends to splurge on a great night out. Fortunately my hype was not an exageration, and everyone loved the restaurant and their meals.   We started with the large charcuterie board which was packed with 3-4 slices of about 10 different types of cured meats, several mustards, some great pickled things, and bread. It was a fun appetizer to share as everyone sampled the different cured meats then exclaimed \"No, no, no, THIS one is the best.\" We split the app 3 ways, but it is certainly large enough for 4-5 people.   For my entre I had the dry aged ribeye which came with caramelized onion puree, parsnip puree, and berneise sauce. The steak was fantastic, cooked edge to edge at a perfect medium rare. The purees allowed you to mix and match tastes until you found your perfect combo. One of my friends had this duck confit/pork/beef ragu that tasted like the worlds best slow braised pot roast. My other friend had the the short rib with goat cheese risotto and charred/roasted brussel sprouts. It was a huge plate of savory/tangy/rich goodness, hands down the winning plate of the night. We topped the meal off with a great cup of La Prima coffee, and everyone was pleased.  All together we each spent $60 including tip, which was just the right amount of money to prove to my friends that it's absolutely worth doping a little cash once and a while for a memorable meal. Hopefully we will no longer be limited to $.25 wings, and $2 yuengs!",

Their bread and butter appetizer with olives baked in was soooo good. We had the small salume--surprisingly, it was not the cured meats that tasted salty at all, but rather the sauces and pickled vegetables they paired with it.  The coolest part of Cure is the setting. You can see right into the kitchen, and it has a rather homey feel to it (despite the large taxidermied boar heads above). It is small and intimate, and perfect for an anniversary dinner.  The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because of our entrees. We both ordered pasta dishes--what I got was a dish of pulled lamb with a few small balls of pasta. I also have a very low salt tolerance, and found much of the food to be very salty.",

During the course of our meal we had three people attend to us.  As others here, we started with the large salumi. Very interesting and a great start. Between us we had trout, pork cheeks, pork trotters, and beef. Pretty presentations, interesting ingredients. And all were quite tasty.   Deductions: our great waitress rushed us with our appetizer, taking it before we had finished it. Really. Had we lingered too long on this wonderful meat? From then on we were self-conscious about the time and wondering when we might again be pushed. We weren't, but it took a little shine off the experience.",

    "text": "For my husband's birthday, my parents gifted us the dinner and round trip Uber.  I had been to Cure with my parents when we first moved, and Husband was working late. We had a phenomenal dinner, which included an outrageously tasty and original strawberry gazpacho and memorable drinks. Before the end of the meal, my parents had decided, and I agreed, that dinner would be a great birthday present for Husband.  I was so excited for the meal, and they seated us right when we arrived, at a comfortably table in the corner. The decor is the definition of rustic: wood floors, wood tables, and pig heads hanging on the wall. The waitstaff was attentive and friendly.  We took a few minutes to decide on cocktails to start, and ordered the tasting menu. My husband was a little weary of the unusual flavors, but I egged him on. Here is the menu:  ONE WAY TICKET TO FLAVOR TOWN  6 course tasting - 80 beverage pairing - 35 July 28th, 2016 SNACKS lardo - fermented radish, crostini nduja - Pecorino Romano, maple sugar, pine nut roasted oyster - bourbon bacon, mustard seed, grapes macaron - foie blonde, tea soaked prune duck tasso - strawberry soffrito, green cardamom pancetta tessa - cynar honey, pickled peppers* 2014 Ritter von Gluck Riesling, Rheinhessen, Germany SOUP roasted peach and brioche, black olive, catnip NV Vicente Gandia 'Hoya de Cadenas' Cava Macabeo/Chardonnay, Valencia, Spain ORECCHIETTE chantrelle, sweet corn, chervil, ricotta salata 2013 Val de Mer Petit Chablis Chardonnay, Burgundy, France HANGER STEAK burnt eggplant, crispy-smoked potatoes, padron pepper, caramelized onion, walnut, sauce \"muhammara\" 2014 Pierre Morel 'Luberon' Grenache/Syrah, Rhone, France SMOKED GOAT CHEESE MOUSSE apple cider marmalade, sesame streusel BASIL YOGURT PANNA COTTA blueberry consomme, hazelnut, lemon, hibiscus cucumber-elderflower spritzer *consuming raw or undercooked meat, seafood or eggs may increase your chance of a foodborne illness *please inform us of any allergies  The tasting menu is a bit cheaper than tasting menus in New York are, which made it feel a little less stressful and less pressure to enjoy. This was good, because, well, some of the dishes weren't as enjoyable as we had hoped.   The \"Snacks\" course was brought out before we were halfway done with our drinks, so we knew we would be rushed through dinner. The whole 6-course meal took a little over and hour and a half, and many pairing we rushed to finish before starting the next pairing, so we definitely were rushed. Some of the Snacks were delicious (roasted oyster, duck tasso), some were merely okay, and some just didn't work very well (foie gras macaron).  The soup was...interesting. Husband didn't like it at all, and didn't eat more than a bite or two. I finished it, but didn't love it. The catnip was extremely bitter, but not in a way that pleasantly balanced out the sweet peach. The brioche was not a shiny eggy bread, but a white gel at the bottom of the soup, which was delicious and an interesting texture. Overall, not our favorite course. We were later asked what we thought of the soup, since it was new for them, and I told them what I just told you. They took a little bit off the bill, which was nice and unexpected.  The pasta course was tasty, but not outrageous. The pasta was homemade and the texture was perfect. The sauce was remarkably corn-tasting, which was pleasant. We both finished our plates.  The steak was the highlight of the meal, The steak was perfectly cooked: crispy around the edges and red in the center. There was a baba-ganoush-style sauce on one side and a sweet caramelized onion sauce on the other. A bite of steak dragged through both sauces was memorably tasty and the highlight of the meal.  I enjoyed the smoked cheese and dessert, although didn't take any lasting memories from either. My husband was lukewarm on the cheese and didn't finish his dessert. The drink pairing from the dessert, however, was as wonderfully sweet, complex, and delicious as our starting cocktail, and ended the meal on a happy note.",

    "text": "Dinner reservation 2/14/16 We wanted to go somewhere new for Valentine's Day and our 10 year anniversary, so we decided on CURE, based on all the great reviews we've heard and read. We are so glad we did! The location is a bit surprising, but when you walk through the doors, it becomes a whole new world. The service was phenomenal. Our server Cass, was friendly and knowledgeable. He made great recommendations to us and we decided on the 6 Course tasting dinner with the wine pairing. What a great choice! The progression of the food from the beginning until the end was a True culinary journey. Each food was better than the next. The portions were small (tapas style) but they were totally appropriate for the number of foods served. Chef Justin Severino is a genius! The combinations that he put together were unique and surprising all the while being absolutely delicious. We ended with the chocolate souffle and the citrus desserts. The perfect ending to a perfect dinner. We loved it!  Chef Severino was friendly and accessible, visible the entire time expediting and overseeing all the preparations. Gladly, but briefly conversed and shook our hands, and was very gracious hearing our praise.  A truly unique, exceptional and indescribable culinary experience. With service to match from the entire staff.  Cure!! Not for the average person certainly.  But quite remarkable. Ed & Susan",

When we arrived, our table wasn't ready yet, and there is no bar or waiting space (that was the only detraction). There also isn't much in the area, so we wandered around for 5 minutes, and then waited inside.  Once we were seated, we ordered the salumi and cheeses. Both were amazing - but the salumi doesn't compare to anything I've ever ordered in terms of charcuterie.  I recommend that everyone try it.  Three people in our party got a fish dish, I got pork with kale, and my husband got a dish called 'meats' - well named.  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their entrees - absolutely no complaints. The dishes have creative flavor combinations and are extremely well prepared. I'd back in a second.  We finished off our meal with chocolate souffles - all very good. I'd go back in a second and wish I lived in Pittsburgh to visit more!",

There is a narrow wine selection for a \"charcuterie\" and the gnocchi plate was extremely salty and only contained about ten actual gnocchi (which were quite good, but overwhelmed by the rest of the dish). The meat plate is nowhere near to die for.  The sauces were unusually sour, the meaty flavors were dull, and some pieces were overcooked. Overall a big disappointment, given the comments here and the street talk.",

The space is small but still very comfortable. You can see the crew cooking in the open kitchen in the back. Menu items are listed on a chalkboard and printed to a piece of paper that is attached to a wooden board at the table.  We were a party of 6 and everyone enjoyed their experience. We started with a cheese platter as an appetizer. It contained three different cheeses (all locally produced), marinated dates, honey comb and grilled bread. It was a wonderful starter.  True to its name, this is a meat place. So don't expect a ton of vegetarian options. In fact, there was only one entree my friend could order. She knew what to expect and really enjoyed the risotto. I had the gnocchi with braised pancetta. The gnocchi seemed larger than life and was tastefully displayed in a hearty bowl. I would like to try the duck the next time I go back. Don't expect an abundance of food. Expect real high quality portions. Also, the place is BYOB.  My only complaint with the restaurant is how loud it can get. The ceilings are high and tin which causes an echo. Otherwise, I highly recommend giving it a try.",

The decor has a very rustic \"all-wood-everywhere\" feel that somehow manages to be cool without being too pretentious. I highly recommend the foie blonde macarons as a small starter. The pate was light and paired nicely with the hibiscus and pistachio accompaniments. The squid ink pappardelle pasta was amazing (although decidedly un-photogenic, or i would have snapped a picture). The pasta was tender, the flavors were wonderful, and the chunks of lobster were much larger than expected. My only \"complaint\" was the size of the portions for the amount that you pay. The pasta was available in both half and whole servings,  but the half-serving (in comparison to most other restaurants that I've been to) felt more like a quarter-portion. If you are coming hungry, make sure to load up on all of their other offerings or spring for the full portion to make sure that you aren't left wanting more!",

We ordered the tuna crudo and porchetta tonato for appetizers.  I liked the tuna crudo more because it tasted more fresh but both were good and complicated dishes.  For entree my wife had the walleyed pike and I had the hanger steak.  Honestly it was probably the best hanger steak I've ever had!  Seriously, the combination of the red wine shallots, caramelized onion, crispy leek, cipollini onion, cheddar cauliflower puree, and lobster bearnaise was the best combination I've had in a loong time.  The pike was also good with a nice seared crust.  Not to compare to meat and potatoes (which I know we did) but we had the pleasure of going there as well the night before.  Comparing the two, if you want a more hip young adult louder music type crowd then M&P is a good place to go (food is goodthere as well).  But if you want a more warm feeling dinner with awesome locally sourced food then I'd definitely recommend Cure!",

    "text": "We FINALLY made it to Cure (week before we leave Pittsburgh) and thank God we did. Best restaurant I have ever eaten at, hands down. If M&P is my affordable, can go fairly often for really good food restaurant, then Cure convinced me it could be my favorite date night place ever. If we weren't moving.  The food is beyond delicious. Our meals were so perfect ... amazing ... etc. etc. David ordered the Meats platter and I got the Beef, Goat, & Pig Heart Bolognese. When they came out, my first thought was, \"Gee, you don't get a whole lot for the price.\" Not that I need nor want a ton of food, but this looked tiny! However, after the first bite of my bolognese I didn't care. The meats were so rich and tasty and delightful and the pasta was cooked perfectly! I couldn't stop saying \"Omg\" at first. My bf's meat platter came with squab breast, duck confit, pork belly, chickpea frites, muhamarra, baba ganoush, harissa, za'atar, feta, and orange. There wasn't a bite on there that wasn't amazingly delicious (I don't have enough adjectives in my vocabulary to describe this food!).   When I first moved here I convinced David and his family that curing, brining, and smoking were absolutely the way to go with most meats, if you have the time and equipment. Cure just further proves that point. Cure takes a really great dish and elevates it to damn near perfection.  I guess I should talk about the cocktails, too. I think this is the first review where that part of the review didn't come first, though we sat at the bar for like an hour before we ordered food. Our drinks were very tasty, indeed, and the bartender - Colin - was nice and friendly. But seriously - dat food.  This is opposite of M&P or Eleven in that, at least at the bar, it doesn't really encourage hanging out and just sipping cocktails. Once the another couple came to the bar area (there's only 4 seats), it was rather cramped. Once we were done eating it was like, \" ... Ok, let's go.\" But that's ok, I don't need to dwell in every restaurant. 5 stars for Cure.",

The first time at Cure we took one look at the menu and knew some direction from our server would be needed and welcome due to the complexity of ingredients.  However our server was less than helpful, offering very little information beyond \"that's good\".  We ordered the Salumi which is a huge assortment of meats.  It was fun trying the different meats and we had little idea what we were eating.  The atmosphere was quite nice - cozy and quaint.  Overall we were disappointed on our first visit, but felt like we needed to take another shot at cure due to all the \"buzz\".  Second visit - we were seated at the bar which was a little cramped but fine.  Our bartender was also our server and took quite a while to attend to us even though we were seated directly in front of him.  Our drinks were very small and very expensive for the size, but pretty (if that's what you want in a cocktail).  We went with wine for our next round of drinks.  Our meal was OK - we just weren't getting that jazzed about Cure overall.  We had the smoked trout and the gnocchi.  We also got an order of beef tartare which was excellent - best part of the meal.  For dessert we had frozen creme brulee which in our opinion didn't really \"work\".  We like creme brulee to be \"cremey\" not hard.  Finally we had some coffee with hazelnut liqueur that was just bad.   So, overall we just aren't understanding all the hype and buzz surrounding this restaurant.",

    "text": "Let me just preface this review by saying I don't eat meat.  Fish, yes.  Meat, no.  My boyfriend was excited about making a reservation at Cure and looked forward to it all week. Me...not so much.  I was worried I wasn't going to find anything I would enjoy on the menu.  However, after our fantastic meal last weekend, I quickly changed my tune.  The atmosphere was what got me first.  Rustic and simple, with tables that resembled cutting boards and no-frills table settings.  It was dark, cozy, and perfect for a date night.  Next came our menus...a piece of scorched paper, attached to a block of wood with a rubber band.  Interesting.  I went straight for the fish entree, which that night, happened to be a swordfish conserva.  It was served with \"squid ink spaghetti, lobster- San Marzano tomato sauce, Meyer lemon, bagna cauda, parsley, artichoke\" and sounded fabulous!  My boyfriend went with a rabbit porchetta, which came with \"almond, roasted garlic polenta, pickled fennel, pancetta, apple, lacinato kale.\"  These descriptions are taken from the menu, which changes weekly in order to reflect seasonal availability.  While we were waiting for our food, I couldn't help but notice the eclectic music playlist Cure had going on that evening...mostly indie, with some Wiz Khalifa jams thrown in.  I was digging it.  When my dinner arrived, I was surprised at the large portion.  Two nice-sized pieces of swordfish sat on either side of an equally large serving of squid ink pasta, topped with a tomato and lobster sauce.  The fish was, simply, put, amazing. The little bites of lobster in the sauce set off the saltiness of the squid ink pasta.  Any skepticism I had of enjoying my meal here was completely gone at this point.  Where I found my portion to be almost over sized, my boyfriend's was pretty much at the opposite end of the spectrum. Luckily for him, I was willing to part with a few bites of my swordfish.  We finished the meal with Cure's chocolate souffle cake, a moist and decadent dessert topped with peanut butter, sea salt, and a touch of olive oil.  A fantastic way to end a delicious meal.  Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant to carnivores and pescatarians (vegetarians, you might be out of luck).  I love that this restaurant has such a committed focus on using local, sustainable, and ethical products in their cooking.  Also note that it a BYOB establishment, and I highly recommend making a reservation.",

    "text": "Stop reading this review and go to eat at Cure right now!  Given that you're still reading, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume Cure is closed for the night, so let me help you plan your attack for when they reopen their doors tomorrow.  There is a lot of hype about Cure. Some would say that kind of hype is just from people trying to justify paying $30 for an entree. NOT SO. Cure is all that and an extra large Salumi plate on the side!    A beautiful painted copper ceiling balanced the rustic wooden beams decorating the walls and the hot wooden plates our meals were served on.  Besides the menus printed on torn paper, the friendly staff, and the giant stencil pig spray painted on the side of the building, cure is an entirely unpretentious affair.  They cure all their own meats in house, which results in some of the most unique and intense flavors I've ever experienced.  Virtually every dish surprises, with low and high end fusions like pigs feet with lobster sauce and pig cheek and parsnip pie.  The steak and potatoes are the most well prepared you could find.  Yet, the wholly inventive daily specials did not end with the entrees!  We finished with the amazing cheese plate, smoked goat cheese doughnut, and an impossibly indulgent yet fluffy dark chocolate souffle cake.  I feel genuinely lucky to have cure in our city.  I'll go back every chance I get!",

    "text": "Tried Cure yesterday for my anniversary, and was definitely not disappointed.  I loved the rustic, almost butcher block-esque decor.  For a small restaurant like Cure, it made it feel almost like you could be dining in the middle of the woods somewhere.    We started with the watermelon heirloom tomato appetizer and it was delicious.  I forget exactly what the crunch was in the appetizer, but it was a little spicy and that kick added a lot to the rest of the dish.    I had the Pork Loin Roast  and I was very pleased with it.  It had some fennel, a roasted (perhaps grilled) tomato under, some 30 year old balamic, and a corn polenta.  The pork was cooked perfectly, and the dish as a whole was excellent.  My only complaint was that the pork itself didn't have a ton of flavor, but with the fennel and balsamic it made up for it.    For dessert we split the dark chocolate souffle cake.  It was awesome, i mean it's a dark chocolate souffle with sea salt and a pistachio butter, tough not to be awesome.",

Chef Justin Severino is a humble genius who took what he learned elsewhere and brought it home to his native Pittsburgh. What he has created is a magical mashup of haute cuisine and good old fashioned references to Pittsburgh's turn-of-the-20th-century ethic, working-class culture. It's not cheap but go for a special occasion, and take every out-of-town guest who visits you here in our fair city. Cure is the best of the best.

They make it on site from roots, but I will order it next time \"neat\" without the creme and such.  Dining room is small but adequate.  Door to the outside has an entry way so you can sit by the door and not get clobbered by wind, cold or heat depending on the season.  Trout of fine.  The salami plate was excellent by most standards but I realized I am not that much of a meat person, or salami style meat person.  Fine dining to be sure.  I give 5 stars to include the food, the wait staff, and the ultra friendly manager that was there.  Get reservations early.  Go early.  And if you want to hang a bit, tell the manager ahead of time so they don't program the table away.  Tip generously please.  PS deserts were stunningly well done as was the espresso.  Next time I will start with espresso and desert!",

    "text": "My wife and I started out our wedding anniversary weekend here at Cure on a Saturday night.  She has had this restaurant bookmarked for about 3 years and we were waiting for that right occasion to finally come.  It shouldn't have taken us this long to come here but it was so worth the wait!   I made a reservation for this day about 4 weeks prior and it was for 645pm.  We walked in and every table was full besides the one that was reserved for us.  It's a smaller sized restaurant so you feel a little squished at first.  There was a table of about 8 or 10 people to the left of us and they felt really close to us.  They were a large group and kind of loud.  Luckily they were about to leave and when they did it was a lot more peaceful for us.       We ordered drinks and then a Bob Marley song came on!  That was nice because we got married in Jamaica and we love Bob Marley's music now.  That was really cool!        We pretty much knew what we were going to order for our entree but we weren't sure what to get for an appetizer.  Their appetizers are under their snacks menu off of their A La Carte Dinner Menu.  We looked at the menu and we weren't sure what was what.  We asked our waiter about a few snacks and he described it very well to us.  We ended up ordering the Bruleed Halloumi from their Snacks menu.  I don't remember how our waiter described this dish but I do remember him saying cheese.  We really didn't know what to expect.       About ten minutes later a chef from the kitchen brought us our \"Snack\".  There was a Bruleed Halloumi for each of us on our own plates which was so awesome!  It looked really fancy and just outright beautiful.  He described to us the dish again and I was very impressed.  I love having that interaction with the chef.  You can see the picture from my review on how this dish looks but it tasted so good.  The cheese was delicious!  There were other ingredients in there like a golden beet, concord grape, and thyme honey that went really well with the cheese.  Just a great overall little dish.  I could have eaten ten of these!         We ordered our entrees next.  My wife ordered their duck and I got their Hanger and I asked for it medium.  They suggested medium rear but I still wanted medium.       The entrees came out at a reasonable time and the same chef from the kitchen before brought them to us.  He explained each dish and we were ready to dive in!  Again the presentation and explanation of the dish was great.  It made everything come together so wonderfully this night.  My wife loved her duck.  She is very picky with duck and she always compares it to her favorite duck at another restaurant. This was the best she said!  It was so good I started eating her food LoL!       My Hanger was great as well.  So tender and it was melting in my mouth.  I always know that portions aren't always that big in nice restaurants like this.  That's why we ordered a snack before and maybe I should have ordered another one.  It still was a good portion and it was filling for me.  I just didn't eat anything most of the day to make sure I was hungry for the night but I didn't need to do that.       I would have probably ordered dessert if we weren't going out to other places after this.  Cure is probably the best restaurant we have ever been to together.  Great restaurant but most of all a great restaurant experience for us.   The pleasure of our waiter and the chef bringing us our food, the presentation, and him describing the dishes to us made the difference.  I felt like we were on Master Chef!       One minor concern is if you do bring your kids to dinner here to be careful in the men's room if you have a son.  There is a picture of a topless woman above the urinal.  We saw a few kids there too so just be careful if you bring you son into the men's room.       I wish it didn't take us three years to come here.  We will be back and looking forward to have another great restaurant experience here.  Thanks Cure for making our Wedding Anniversary very special and memorable.",

    "text": "I wish I could give Cure 10 stars.  Absolutely phenomenal!  We dined here for our wedding anniversary and to say the food was three Michelin star worthy is an understatement.  The atmosphere at Cure is tight, and on the loud side, but the decor is welcoming as were all the servers and chefs.    We started with a couple drinks.  I ordered an OLD PAL rye whiskey / kina blanc / cappelletti - 10.  It was nicely presented by our waiter.  The drink was tasty.  After perusing the menu a little more we decided on an appetizer of Bruleed Halloumi - 10 chamomile, golden beet tahina, concord grape & thyme honey, malawach..  To better explain the Halloumi is a unripened brined cheese made from a mixture of goat's and sheep's milk, which was bruleed, assuming blowtorch, with two dipping sauce and a piece of malawah a Yemenite Jewish fried bread.    As we waited we enjoyed the atmosphere and some conversation.    When our appetizer arrived the chef approached our table to explain what exactly to expect.  The interaction with the chef made the tasting so much more exciting.  And the presentation was beautiful.  I really expected the appetizer to be on one plate and given smaller plates to share, but no it was split into two identical portions.  PERFECT!  No arguments over who gets the last bite.  The halloumi was crusted, slightly warmed, and delicious.  The sauces were interesting.  I didn't care much for the Concord grape sauce, too sweet for my palate.  But the honey sauce was a nice subtle sweet to balance the rich cheese.  I am so loving this and we have just begun.   Our entrees arrived a little later.  Again accompanied by an introduction from the chef.  I ordered the Duck breast -30- cynar caramel, spiced cabbage, brown butter Asian Pears, cilantro, vanilla served on a bed of sweet potato mousse.  Oh my Lord I want that mousse recipe!  The duck was nicely seared to a medium rare, and every bite mixed with all the ingredients on the plate was astounding.  I could possible run out of flattering words to describe this place before this review is over, but that's just how wonderful this dining experience was.  The portion sizes were just right, leaving me satisfied but not stuffed.      Cure hit it out of the park, grand slam, clear the deck, raise the Jolly Roger, Elvis has just left the building, and scratch my back with a hacksaw!",

    "text": "Cure has been on my 'must-visit' list for a long time, and I finally got an opportunity to visit for my recent wedding anniversary. I am so glad we went.  First and foremost - your visit to Cure isn't going to be cheap. It's worth it, though, so it's best to go in accepting that you'll be spending a pretty penny on this experience.  We decided not to do the tasting menu on our first trip, as we wanted to pick & choose what we were able to try. We ended up trying a variety of things without having to spend as much as the tasting menu costs, though we didn't get to try as much as we would have with the tasting menu. I think if I were to do it again, I'd do the same exact thing. That said, the tasting menu does appear to be pretty eclectic and inclusive.  We started out with the beef tartare and the salumi board. The tartare was good and very new to me. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I'm glad we tried it! The salumi board was a perfect appetizer, but there's a lot going on and it's easy to get confused/overwhelmed with what you're eating.  We then shared the Pork on Pork on Pork and the agnolotti pasta. The pork was amazing (except for the ramp mustard, but I think that's just me!) and the pasta was a great choice for sharing. It was a bit rich for my taste, but sharing it gave me the perfect amount so I could appreciate it.  Everything we had was delicious and the presentation was beautiful. I especially appreciated our server, who explained the menu to us and then talked us through what specifically we were eating with both our appetizers and our entrees. She was thorough, friendly and professional and I really think she made our experience!   All in all, we'd definitely come back to Cure to celebrate another special occasion!",

Second, be clear in your menu- don't describe a bunch of pork by-products as a Pork Shoulder for Two.  Blood sausage isn't for everyone.",

They didn't seem to be aware though; when we were ordering, the server did not seem to be aware of SC's allergies and we had to mention it again (This was the third time allergies were discussed; once when placing the reservation, second when the reservation was confirmed, and third while ordering). However, besides this, the service was really attentive. Multiple staff members walked around to see if guests needed anything, to clear off old dishes/utensils and place new ones, to remove crumbs on tables, and to explain components of each dish (I really like this last part because I can never remember all the ingredients listed on the menu!). We also mentioned we were splitting all the dishes so they were able to either split the meal for us (and give us separate portions) or give us extra dishes to split it ourselves.  We ordered:  -Salumi (small). SO good. We especially loved the leek ash & porcini salami for it's texture and flavor. The duck speck and ciccioli were also some of our faves. The accompanying focaccia was really soft and had great flavor. It didn't quite work with the nduja (\"spreadable\" salumi). Definitely taste the meats with and without the bread; it's a different experience! The Violet mustard was also really good (I hate mustard but this had a nice fig-gy flavor).  -This is Why You're Here. My fave dish of the night. What a fantastic combination of thinly sliced ham with maple notes, peach jam (that really tasted more molasses-y), and lots of basil!  -Ravioli  (half). Also delicious! Loved the crispy corn and walnuts! The pasta was made really well.  -Charcroute. SC's favorite dish. Pork three ways (pork belly, braised cheek, boudin blanc) which provided interesting textures and flavors.   -Foie Blonde. What an interesting dish! We've never had savory macarons before and this was such a unique combination. SC thought it was kinda like a PB&J twist. The mousse-like foie is super salty but pairs perfectly with crunch of the macaron and pistachios and the sweet of the hibiscus jam.   -Paw Paw Cream Pie. Reminded us of a deconstructed S'more. We've never had paw paw before and honestly couldn't really pick up what it tasted like. The textures of the cinnamon meringue w/ paw paw curd went well with the graham bits on the bottom. We thought the meringue had a little too much cinnamon on it. The accompanying concord grape ice cream was really tasty (SC and I were just recently talking about how no one ever makes grapes the star of dessert! And while this was an accompaniment, it was still really well done!).  Overall, really interesting flavor combinations and ideas; would definitely return!!",

    "text": "Everyone raves about Cure in Pittsburgh. I had high hopes for the restaurant, especially after having a great experience at its sibling restaurant Morcilla. A friend and I dropped by on a weekday night to see just what makes Cure great. It is definitely an interesting restaurant, although some parts of my visit were just so-so. Overall, it's a good restaurant. It still needs a bit of oomph to make it a great restaurant.  AMBIANCE & SERVICE: 5/5 It's adorable on the inside. The waitstaff were very friendly, knowledgeable, and proactive in making sure our visit was a good one. The interior was tastefully decorated; the glasses and tableware thoughtfully chosen to match the ambiance of the space.  FOOD: 3.5~4/5 I had a hard time rating the food for this restaurant. Overall, I liked the food. I didn't love the food, however, probably because I found some of the dishes a little too salty. Here's what we had:  - Salumi: beautifully presented on a wooden board, the salumi plate is any meat lover' dream. Personally, I'm not a big eater of meat, but I liked the selection with its different textures, flavors, and meat varieties. Each variety of meat came in small, bite-sized pieces, which made it a great dish to share and to sample.  - Bruleed Halloumi: so... we did not know what Halloumi was, but we took the suggestion from our waitress and ordered this dish. We later learned that Halloumi is actually a cheese, with a firm-tofu texture. This dish was interesting, but its taste was marred by just a bit too much sodium in the sauce.  - Ricotta Cavatelli: we ordered half a portion of this pasta. This was my favorite dish of the night - I really liked the richness of the cheese. My friend thought it was a bit too salty, but I think it was just about okay.  - Fluke: the kitchen split our one order of the Fluke entree onto two plates, which was super nice. The fish was very fresh, and was topped with a fancy tartar sauce.  - Chocolate cake: and finally, we had one order of the warm chocolate cake to share. It was beautifully plated, with a dollop of pistachio butter for flavor. I really liked the consistency of the cake on this one.  OVERALL: 4/5 I enjoyed the flavors of the food, but most of the dishes could have scaled back on the sodium a bit. You should check out Cure, though, at least for a bite of that salumi plate (and its picture perfectness)!",

In case the name and the logo weren't obvious enough, the chef is a skilled charcutier and his talent really shows through their small but original and refined menu.  I cannot recommend the charcuterie board enough. It featured a great variety of salumi served with small pickled vegetables. It was quite a delightful experience trying each cuts. I also liked their drink list; seriously, they had me at house-made sodas. While it was beautiful and complemented the meal well, I thought it was a bit too small and overpriced.  Overall, I've enjoyed my dining experience at Cure and would not hesitate to recommend it. If you enjoy a cocktail with you meal, be prepared that you will be ordering a few of them (due to their small size) and that they are costly.",

With that being said I ate at Cure on a Sunday early evening with a couple friends that recently moved to the area.  I joked around about how hungry we were and the server told us we'd needed to order all of our courses at once which I understand given I was previously industry.  The charcuterie and apps did not disappoint.  We waited another hour to get our entrees, we all ordered pasta dishes which were sub par, the aldente in the bolognese was  so aldente you could taste raw flour.  I guess my main gripe is that I wished someone would've addressed our long food wait and when we tried to make eye contact with the server he dodged our looks.  There are so many great places to dine that I would think twice about coming here again.",

    "text": "My first time at Cure was for my anniversary, so we wanted to taste the best of the menu. We decided to try the tasting menu with the wine pairings. We celebrated with friends, so, initially, we were concerned that it wouldn't be enough food. Cure told us that they would adjust the amount of food per person, but we would all have to par take in the tasting. We agreed, and the amount ended up being perfect for 4 people! Now on to the actual taste. The starters were the tables favorite! It was such an interesting combination of flavors going beyond the great quality of ingredients (you could really taste the quality). It was truly an experience. Unfortunately, the salumi was not a part of the tasting, so we had to order it separately. It was worth it! The simplicity of quality meat prepared to perfection was overwhelming exciting. We even contemplated getting another order. Even the champagne pairing was hitting every flavor note. I thought to myself, \"everyone was right, this place is amazing\". Then came the cold soup, and we started to go down from the hill of \"flavor town\". The flavors were great, but I'm not a huge fan of cold soup. It was also paired with Sherry; which I don't care for. Then the worst thing I ever ate...pork on pork with cider. It was so fatty, mixed with overly tart sauerkraut, and the stinkiest cider. I honestly could not take another bite. The table agreed. After that, we started moving back up \"flavor towns\" mountain. However, the wine pairings were becoming smaller and smaller, and the quality of food was becoming muddled with intense competing flavors. All in all, Cure started off strong with main dishes being complimented by additional flavors, to the flavors taking over covered up by mediocre wine. I still absolutely enjoyed the experience, and the staff were terrific!",

I understand that Pittsburgh has a dearth of chic restaurants but this one is an imposter trying to desperately be Brooklyn-chic but clumsily failing.  - The drinks were severely watered down - brought this to the attention of the server - was not addressed - The beef tartare was meh - nothing special - the lettuce wrap concept is tired and does nothing for the already mediocre beef - The salumi platter had rancid meats and the pate had all the charm of canned deviled ham, the mustard was decent, perhaps the only good part of the platter. The focaccia wasn't bad but good focaccia does not a great salumi platter make.  - Oysters were ok - nothing special. The plating was clumsy and aesthetically... just trying too hard. I did not like that plastic bottle stuck between the ice, just so lame in the effort to be molecular gastronomy adjacent... *eyeroll* - The trout was prepared well but I suspect that was the cook. The \"ramp ash\" was just overcooked soggy ramp, not great, and not meshing well with the calabrian chili oil. The flavors were just not there the way they planned. - Now for the worst. The cacio e pepe. Pasta was overcooked and flavorless. The sauce had the flavor of dollar store alfredo. The \"black truffles\" addition was a touch of truffle butter which I bet that they got for 13.99 on Amazon... I got nary a whiff of truffle ANYTHING and we got this sub-par gooey mess for the wonderful price tag of 36 USD.   At this point, no one was interested in any further dessert disappointments so we paid the 200 for dinner and peaced out. All in all, the thoroughly disappointing Fathers Day Dinner. And to think, I canceled a reservation at Polo Bar to come to Pittsburgh and take my parents to this sad little place.  Oh... and the restaurant is in a crappy part of Lawrenceville. Completely dead on a Sunday evening.",

I love cured meats, and the food porn uploaded from fellow yelpers made this establishment incredibly appealing.  I finally made the trip recently with a visiting college friend who knows how to enjoy food like I do.  Food (9.0/10) = I suggest you take a look at the pictures uploaded on yelp.  You will see pictures of that charcuterie board,...that shrine of porcine holiness on a platter.  All those layers of smokey and salty.  A vegetarian's nightmare.  Oh sweet lord baby jesus.  Bresaola, black strap ham, culatello, goat prosciutto, coppa secca, duck speck, chorizo, goat-mushroom-madeira salami, cocoa-espelette salami, finnochiona, negroni, mortadella, pork rillettes, duck rillettes, pates and terrines, lardo, and more!   For the entree, I had the \"meats.\" They should be more creative and call it something more exotic like \"Two birds creating harmony with a pig.\"  Sounds like something from an Asian poem?  Or maybe it sounds a bit dirty...hah.  2 birds = duck confit and squab breast.  The squab breast was juicy and tender.  It was the bird version of filet mignon.  Pig = pork belly.  Yes.  PORK BELLY.   These animals were flanked by chickpea frites, muhamarra, baba ganoush, harissa, za' atar, feta, and orange.  For dessert, we got the dark chocolate souffle cake with pistachio butter and sea salt.  The dessert was disappointing.  It was dry, and nothing spectacular.  $10 for something meh.  We got it because it was one of the most mentioned items on Yelp.  If my heavenly experience wasn't contaminated by the mediocre dessert, I would be giving Cure a 10/10 food rating, and slapping this place with 5 yelp stars.  Alcohol selection was good.  Only had beer.  Didn't try any of the cocktails or wine.  I just prefer beer with a large meal dominated by meat.   Ambiance (9.0/10) = a small and cozy place on the corner of a street.  Love the wood interior.  Service (9.0/10) = great service.  Attentive.   Overall Opinion = could this be one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh?  It very well could be, but I'm not ready to place that stamp on Cure yet.   If you want to indulge yourself in sweet/salty/smokey succulent meat, well look no further, because you just educated yourself by reading this review.  Go for the charcuterie board.  Go for the \"Two birds creating harmony with a pig.\"  Be weary of the desserts.",

The drinks were delicious and intriguing.  I could have had at least 4, but I held back since we were going to see Interstellar later. For the starter/app we got the Oysters.  Let me start off by saying I am NOT a seafood fan.  The idea of sucking a creature out of it's home and swallowing it down like a big gooey gelatinous mass really turns my stomach. My SO is really into seafood and especially love oysters.  He really wanted to beef tartar but I am not a fan (it's a texture thing...).  I compromised by getting the oysters which I heard were (inter)stellar (see what I did there? ahh so clever). They were served with some beer, bacon, kale, kohlrabi, horseradish, & lemon.  They were DELICIOUS!  They were everything I imagined to be the opposite of oysters.  Not fishy/seafoody. Perfect balance of beer/bacony salty goodness/spice of horseradish and they weren't raw which was an actual concern of mine. They LOOKED amazing as well. For the entree's my boyfriend got the Gluttony (boudin noir, boudin blanc, bacon confit, trotter croquette, sauerkraut, meat caramel apples, smoked- roasted potatoes, violet mustard, sauce ravigotte, rosemary).  Since I am not a fan of blood pudding/sausage, pig heart, or any such organs... I passed on trying any of his except for the pork belly which was cooked perfectly.   He was in heaven.  He usually eats his food with the relative quickness of a starving animal but this time he took his good old sweet time relishing in every last bite (if only to torture me with how horrified I was that people eat that).   I of course went for the simple spanish hanger steak ( piperade, crab butter roasted sunchokes, pimenton aioli, salsa verde, cilantro).  It was delicious.  The meat was cooked perfectly, normally I don't like hanger steak as it's a cheaper cut of meat, but I could barely tell with how well prepared and seasoned it was.  The crab butter roasted sunchokes were really the star of the whole dish for me.  They were phenomenal. We skipped desert since we were on a tighter schedule than we wanted.   The total bill wasn't outrageous but definitely not a place I would eat at everyday since we're a little more budget conscious.",

Was thoroughly entertained by Severino's not-stop commentary. Downed a couple of cocktails and some wine, and decided: violet mustard is great, and in general there is no reason not to come here and blow all of your cash.",

    "text": "I have heard so much about this place and all of the reviews seem to be off the charts so I had to try it out.  It was ok, dont get me wrong...but I left here a little under-whelmed for the most part.  We tried a little bit of everything.  We ordered two cocktails, the large salumi plate, the soup, the carbonara, a smoked salmon with goat cheese and black garlic/citrus/avocado, and the pork belly.  The cocktails were good.  My complaint with the cocktail was the amount of actual cocktail in the glass.  I had one giant cube of ice that took up almost the entire glass with a little bit of liquid around it.  The large salumi plate was good.  I liked the duck and all of the different cured meats on the platter.  My only comment here was that there was a small bone in one of the pate's I bit into.  I understand how thats made and it happens, but it was large enough that I had to spit it out.  The soup was very good, I enjoyed that.  It had a very different texture that is hard to describe, but it has a nice earthy taste...very nice.  The smoked salmon was BY FAR the BEST dish of the night.  This was perfect.  If you are going to go here you MUST order that.  The goat cheese, black garlic, citrus and avocado was perfect with it.  Then...for whatever reason, there was a LONG pause between that and our next course.  Honestly, probably 15-20 minutes.  I started keeping time after about 5 minutes...  The carbonara was...ok.  I was expecting something more flavorful and I just didnt get it.  It was a little too bland.  I had truffle added to mine.  I LOVE truffle...and even the truffle was bland.  You didnt get that \"truffle\" taste.  I was disappointed in this dish.  Finally was the Pork Belly.  I love Pork Belly.  This was very good.  I would probably rate this as second behind the Salmon.  We looked at the dessert menu but there were only 2 to choose from, neither of which caught our eye.  I would probably come back just to give it another shot, but for me, it just didnt live up to the hype.",

    "text": "Great atmosphere, killer cocktails, beautiful AND delicious food.  We started off with the steak tartar. It was well prepared, had great sauces, and was of course beautifully presented. I had the duck confit - it was delicious and my cocktail of choice for the evening had a spiced plum brandy that I wish I could drink every day (forgive me for forgetting the name).    1 steak tartar + 2 entrees + 2 cocktails = under $100. That's pretty good in my budget-minded book.   Reservations are HIGHLY recommended - they fill up fast!  And yes - this place is all about meat. If you want to eat high quality, creative meals that highlight meat.. go here. If you are vegan or vegetarian... I'm sure they have some kind of delicious option, but this probably shouldn't be on your short list.  Unless you want a great cocktail! Then make a reservation today!!",

Drinks are a bit pricey and on the small side, and my other comment is not having a large ice cube in the cocktail - but I do understand some craftsman bartenders being purist in that respect and not wanted to \"water down\" the drink after mixing.   On to the food.  It is clear Justin Severino is a very accomplished chef as his technique and execution is spot on.  I cannot complain about the components on the plate, only the composition of the plate itself.  Every dish we tasted seemed confusing and not harmonious.  Balance was there (acid, salt, sweet, etc...) but the combinations of flavors and ingredients did not leave me wanting more.  Nothing was a marriage on the plate - just an interesting display of technique.    Would I return?  Yes, but only if I was in the mood to try some different flavor combinations.  I don't think this is a restaurant where you leave and say, \"wow, that was so satisfying and delicious\".  I would guess most leave and say \"that was interesting\"",

This place is a classic.... well maybe not 'classic', because I have experienced flavors I have never dreamed of before i went to Cure.    I have been lucky enough to dine at some of the great restaurants of the US from French Laundry to Rich Table to Underbelly, and Cure takes the cake.  Yes, in my opinion, bite for bite, better than French Laundry.  Of course you're not in Yountville, just across from a car repair shop in up and coming L-Ville, but nevertheless, this place is not to be missed.  Plus, Justin, the owner/ head chef, is an awesome dude all round.  He cares about what he does, he loves his job.  Always updating menus, trying new things and breaking boundaries.  He is always willing to tell you a bit of the dishes... and if you are lucky, give you a tour of the basement curing area.  Go here... you will  not regret.",

The servers and chefs encourage sharing, so my mother and I split the salmon starter dish first. Definitely fresh, the dehydrated salmon didn't have a lot of flavor, but the pureed spreadable salmon was delicious. The lemon sauce went with it so well, but the avocado sauce was also a bit bland. Could have also done with crackers or bread. My brother and father split the carbonara pasta dish. They also make all of their pastas in house. It was creamy salty flavorful and hot, however I didn't think it anything I couldn't make myself. The two entrees were really what we found to be the stars of the meal. The chicken and chickpea tagine, and the hanger steak. Would definitely suggest ordering those two dishes, really delicious. Service was great, and the space is calm and small. Nice drinks as well",

It was difficult to keep the name/type of everything in our heads as we sampled, so we kept calling our waitress over to ask what was what. Noticing we were intrigued, she actually had the manager take us down to their fridge to see the curing meats - score!  Drinks: Cocktails seemed pretty good. I had the japanese whisky cocktail, which I enjoyed. A friend ordered the Duchesse de Bourgogne, a flemish red ale they had on tap. I think I enjoyed that more - both tasty and unique.  Entree: I had the gluttony, which was a few different pieces of pork. The real winner here was the pork belly - a fantastic fatty porky taste, and an even more interesting texture. There was the soft fat, the tender pork, and a nice char on the outside as well. Very well done - I wish I had a plate of just that!  We skipped dessert (though we debated ordering another SALUMI platter). Overall, a very positive experience - probably my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.",

Our reservation was at 9:30 but every seat was full when we arrived, except for two seats at the bar, which only seats 4 guests. The corkage fee for a bottle of wine was $15, I would not have brought the wine but I was unclear about the drink menu. I don't think you can order a vodka tonic, but there is an extensive beer and wine list, and a few craft cocktails.   For starters we shared the brussel sprouts with goat cheese, bacon, and maple. The brussel sprouts tasted a little charred and it wasn't as sweet as I was expecting, but it was good nonetheless. For my entree I had the hanger steak with roasted cauliflower, smoked fingerling potatoes, cheddar custard (which was kind of bland, it didn't taste like cheddar), caramelized onion puree, lobster bernaise sauce, and a red eye bordelaise. The steak was perfectly cooked, a nice char on the outside and medium rare on the inside. The sauces were rich, perhaps a little on the sweet side,  I wanted something salty or acidic in the dish to elevate the flavors.   Everything on the menu looked delicious which made it difficult to decide what to order, so I'll be back soon for more!",

They are combining a lot of different ingredients that just do not combine well. For example, my friend's entree of Pork Belly Confit and Pickled Spanish Mackerel or, my entree, Squid Ink & Leek Ash Gnudi with octopus, beef heart and guanciale bolognese, black olive oil, bonito, basil. My friend wasn't impressed with the pork/fish combo. And I was equally unimpressed with the mish-mash of flavors with my gnudi. Are they just cleaning out the frig???  The service was excellent and the decor is fine. But, the music is way too loud for a small dining room. My biggest complaint is the price of wine. A $10 bottle of wine goes for $10 a glass or $40 a bottle! They must think their customers are stupid!  I can find a lot of great restaurants in Pittsburgh that have a more delectable menu and realistic wine prices or, better yet, BYOB. This was where CURE began. This is the venue that made them famous and they should go back to it!",

First impression: waiters=hipsters Next: boy does is smell good in here!  A plus of sitting at the bar is that we were right next to each other for perfect sharing, and we got to watch the bartenders mix these amazing looking cocktails. They were quite intricate.   Appetizers: salumi (small) and squab wings. The salumi was amazing, my favorite was definitely the duck spec and the pork lardo that was melt in your mouth good. With the squab, they had deep fried garlic that I did not even feel guilty about eating! It was delicious!   Entrees: Hanger steak and pork. Hubby loved the pork belly (it was good, I just have to go running today haha) and the pork sausage was the perfect combo of pork flavors. The hanger steak was cooked to perfection (rare for me!) with a cauliflower-garlic blend that you see on pinterest and try to re-create but it never looks as good in person. Cure nailed it! My fave was definitely the hanger steak.  Dessert: We split the chocolate cake with pistachio butter. The chocolate cake melted in your mouth, and the pistachio butter was a nice cherry-on-top. However, it was not the best aspect of this meal.  Another thing hubby and I appreciated was when he was between two beers, the bartender let him try a taste of each. Little touches like that go a long way.  So go try Cure. You will not be disappointed.",

Quality wise, I was pleased, but not overwhelmed. My charcroute (not a typo, I guess - a variant on chaucroute, although it has little to do with a proper chaucroute) was tasty, but too salty. One of my friends got the duck, and found it dry and too salty as well. The check was salty too...    I like the room, and space, and atmosphere. So, I don't know.

    "text": "Cure is considered by many to be one of Pittsburgh's great restaurants.  Thus, our expectations were high, and susceptible to a let down.  Alas, we received a bit of a smack down at Cure.  Led to a tiny two top in the back corner, it was the table restaurants keep for \"walk ins,\" those folks who casually walk into a restaurant without a reservation.  We made and confirmed our reservation.  The young woman commandeering the \"front,\" was rather perfunctory, and did not analyze the patrons entering her restaurant.  A good Maitre D' always reads people well and sits them where they would be most comfortable.  Older couples should not be assigned this tiny table.   Our server was very professional, but lacked warmth, an aspect of the restaurant design and the dining gestalt.  Cure had a cold affect.  Although the room was rustically designed using wooden tables,chairs, planked flooring, etc. the hard edges needed texture and color.  The decor left me cold.  Cure does not have a bar, and the absence of a central gathering spot also subtracts from any sense of communal fun. Cure isolates you.  Half orders of pasta are on offer, allowing us to try a few dishes without getting over stuffed. Yet, my server recommended pasta was mediocre, the Bolognese sauce weak, although the pasta was properly cooked al dente. The pickled and roasted beets appetizer was okay, with an unmemorable goat cheese foam.  Our trout entrees were good, not great.  While the skin was crisp, the spicy sauce overwhelmed the delicacy of the fish. The accompanying fried lima beans were the highlight of our entire meal.  Our deconstructed chocolate souffle dessert seemed to be an after thought.  I craved a bowl of those fried lima beans instead.  This was a rather unmemorable and mediocre dining experience, probably worth 3.5 stars instead of four.  The bill was quite reasonable however, at $127.00 with one glass of wine and two cocktails.",

There was not a dish that didn't wow us.  Foods we had:  Steak tartare - I love the Korean lettuce wrap presentation of this, and the citrusy kick of the peppers.  Bread & Butter - not only was the bread perfectly fluffy, but the butter had such a complex savor and light texture  Farm Trout Entree - I think this was a clear winner. The beens and veggies had a such a crispy, smokey texture that complemented the perfectly crisped skin of the succulent trout",

I am a fan of pretzels but frying it like that, takes it to the next level! I also ordered the smoked beets which was super nice, it came with this lovely whipped creme frachie.  It was a good balance with the beets.   All the other dishes I saw looked very good.  I would definitely come back here again!",

    "text": "This reason for Cure getting a 5 star this time, is mainly because of how wonderfully the staff responded to an issue with the food that one of my dining companion's experienced. However food-wise, my rank would be closer to a 4-Star.  So, let me start of with the food I got first:   - Shrub drink prices have gone up from $3 when I visited in 2017 to $4 in 2018 (same size glass tho'!). They had a new one this time that I really liked, made of fig, bay leaf and cinnamon - it was refreshingly tarty and tasted similar to a kombucha drink.  - for my main I got the large Salumi ($55) and this was served with pickled veggies (the turmeric cauliflower was a specific stand-out), x2 kinds of mustard (there was a Violet mustard which was deliciously tangy and which I first read as VIOLENT mustard and I had a quiet chuckle as I imagined this amorphous mustard paste rising from the plate and giving me a knock-out punch, ha! But anyway, I digress) and two pieces of focaccia. The charcuterie consisted of 4 pieces of each meats. There was a lot of charcuterie and when I got served, the waitress pointed out each one but honestly it all got blurry as I worked my way thru the board. What was great however that each piece was fresh and tasted fantastic! The charcuterie with pistachio was my fave but everything was really distinctly flavorful. I do however wish the board came with some sort of a Pate / terrine/ galantine/ roulade or maybe even a small slice of the pork rilletes - I wanted some unctuous after all that cured meat! Oh also there was one salumi that bore a distinct taste to jamon iberico, which was a nice surprise. If you are curious what this is - this ham comes from a special breed of Spanish Hogs that's diet consists only of chestnuts and this gives the ham a very distinctive flavour but the one served here was a gentler flavor.  - One of my co-diners got the Vadouvan Cauliflower Soup for ($10) and she got the caramelized crab on the side for me, as she didn't want this seafood component. She's not a fan of Cauliflower but she ended up enjoying this dish and I polished off that crab - it was delish!  - another co-diner got \"A Nice Little Salad\" for $10 and this was a really good sized plate! The radishes looked especially lovely.                                               - My co-diner who got small Chestnut Ravioli for $13 raved about this dish! I was sitting next to her and could totally smell the earthiness of the chestnuts and hazelnuts in the brown butter!   - another winner for our table was the Laurel Hill Farm Trout for $28. It was a half fillet of the trout and I was told the burnt lemon really just elevated the taste of the fish. No one wanted to share and give me a bite, so I'm taking their word for it ;-)  - Choucroute for $34 was a bit of a disappointment for one of my co-diners. It was plated beautifully but the portion given for the pork, the boudin blanc and the boudin noir were really small. My co-diner was still hungry after he finished off the plate. Not a big bloke's meal...  - so I'm saving the problem child of our meal for last. One of my co-diners got the Heritage Farm Chicken ($29) and loved the labneh + harissa pastes. But the chicken which looked like it had been in a sous vide bath, was totally pink and felt spongy when she cut into it. We alerted the waiter and he said he would switch out the dish, but my co-diner felt really uncomfortable about even making another attempt with the chicken, and he change her food choice and she ordered the Chestnut Ravioli instead. The waiter totally didn't make a fuss about this request and instead everything was handled so perfectly and smoothly - his attitude really made a massive difference and my co-diner's dining experience ended up with a high note rather than with her remembering the uncooked chicken!  Lastly, we did get dessert - that Lava Molten cake.. so good! Rich and yet wonderfully light and the pistachio cream was so sweet and distinctly nutty. Great way to end the meal.  So overall verdict? I reckon the tasting menu is honestly the way to go. But I'll still come back and check them out again, when next in Pittsburgh.  Note - this would have been Yelp Review 71/2018, but I don't count reviews for places I have previously reviewed",

    "text": "Cure is definitely \"an experience\" that you have to try once in your life in Pittsburgh. Once may be enough for me, as we spent an exorbitant amount of money here. I know I'm cheap, but when your bill for four people is over $500, it hurts. Granted, our party of four came here for a couples anniversary celebration and so, we definitely spared no expense. We, as a table, shared the Salumi and each got the tasting menu along with drink pairings plus two coffees. I will say the salumi was so worth it if you like cured meats. The tasting menu was good, but could've been better. So the tasting menu started out really strong. As we were eating the snacks, we all saw what the big deal about Cure was. Once we were served the soup, it kind of went downhill from there. While the items were so inventive and beautifully plated, the flavors didn't really do it for us. The drink pairings were ok. For how expensive the pairing was, the pours were quite small.  I absolutely loved the snacks and salumi. If I ever return, I'll stick to ordering items a la cart. If you're celebrating a special occasion and are ok with spending a lot, it's definitely worth a visit.",

The remodel isn't that different but the addition of a community table for walkins is a great idea and although the place was packed, we did not feel crowded at all. We probably over-ordered, with a salumi platter and potato focaccia for the table, starters and mains for everyone, and two desserts, but everything was just SO GOOD that I don't regret it one bit. I have to add, there are certain things that charm the pants off of me in a restaurant, and one of them is the resurrection of a childhood memory - the Grasshopper cocktail (on the dessert menu) brought memories of dinners with my late mom and grandma at a time when I was missing them both. And it was delicious. A fitting birthday celebration.",

    "text": "A fine, fine, fine, indulgence.   We visited Cure this past Saturday to celebrate my husband's birthday. Cure is fine dining with a smoky, approachable ambiance. It definitely strikes a unique balance in attending to all the details, like personal phone calls to confirm reservations and ask if there are any allergies, preferences, etc. and not being too stuffy. It is a pretty small place, so ALWAYS make reservations, and be prepared to be a little flexible with your times (for example, when I called for a Saturday reservation, the only times available were 5:00 PM and 8:00 PM, which was fine for us but I know some people prefer a more neutral dining time).  Once we got there, we hemmed and hawed over whether to go with the 6 course tasting menu or get the large salumi plate and share some other items. In the end, our server convinced us to indulge in the tasting menu (though did not include the wine pairings) and we were not disappointed. My favorite parts were the smoked salmon crostini, coddled eggs (a little salty but such a unique dish), and EVERYTHING on the dessert plate. They even put a candle on my husband's dessert plate which was a nice recognition of his birthday without Applebee's-level group singing cheesiness.  We also ordered a couple of cocktails, but the food was certainly the star of the evening.   Certainly not an inexpensive evening but well worth it.",

    "text": "Finally had the opportunity to try this place since it's been sitting on my Pittsburgh Restaurant list for awhile. First off, my husband and I are still trying to figure out why they do not have any Michelin stars. This is hands down of the best restaurants we have been to from the service (thank you Claire/Clare - sorry if i spelled your name wrong), the delectable flavors of the ingredients, to the ambiance of the restaurant.   We opted to do the A La Carte Menu vs the Tasting Menu. Don't stop reading though, because we made our own Tasting Menu off the A La Carte Menu that included:   Bread + Butter Menu Description: Asiago focaccia, whipped lardo, EVOO, roasted garlic, olives, preserved citrus  This is Why You're Here Menu Description: coppa secca (aged for at least 6 months) - sugar cube melon, balsamic, smoked pine nut, basil  Who Cooks for You Tomatoes: Menu Description: black olive, marcona almond, cucumber, watermelon, cilantro, saffron labneh  Sweet Corn Ravioli (Half Order) Menu Description: brown butter, taleggio, pan fritto, tarragon   N.Y. Strip Menu Description: burnt cipollini & tarragon, caramelized onion,  extra-crispy fingerlings potatoes, buttermilk dressing, charcoal grilled Tuscan Kale  Ground Stone Cherry Tart Menu Description: forgot to capture it but I'll describe how it tasted! Light and airy crust with whipped creme fraiche with lightly sweetened tiny yellow/white/cherries.  The next time I go, I would order the following based on my sly glances at other neighboring tables:  1. Oysters (at least a dozen) 2. Salumi  Last but not least, loved the music playlist - old school rap, hip hop...but nothing to ruin the mood over a romantic candlelight dinner (hint hint).",

However, It clearly states on yelp that it is not really kid-friendly, so I don't see why certain Yelpers get upset that it's not the best place to bring their kids and leave 3-4 star reviews . My boyfriend and I came here and there was a kid behind me whining and throwing a fit . I'm not against kids being that I'm pregnant with twins , but please be considerate of others wanting to enjoy their dinner when you choose where to bring them .   Yes, there's a photo of a topless woman in the men's bathroom , however it's meant for men to see , not your kids .",

    "text": "I've heard so many great comments about this restaurant and have always been wanting to check it out. I think maybe I build up very high expection in my head and this turn out to be below expectations.   This is a cozy restaurant and seems to me that they fit too many tables in there. There is minimum space in between tables. We had a 5pm reservation and that is the time that they open for dinner. We were seated right away at a corner. Then 5 minutes later, another couple were seated next to us! We looked around, the restaurant was still empty. I am not saying that nobody can sit next to us, but when the tables are so close to each other and the restaurant has a lot of open seatings. I would think the right thing to do is to spread out the customers around the room. Filling in as it is getting crowded. Not just put them all in lines next to each other to start with. Like I said before, there is minimum space in between tables. So we could hear everything from our neighbor table even if they are whispering. So my husband and I stopped talking unless it is necessary and I think the couple sat next to us did the same thing, they weren't talking very much after they put their food order in. It is awkward to talk when other people can hear everything you are saying. It is also awkward to have a very quite meal with my husband, and it was my birthday dinner too. So.. That's something I would improve if I was the owner.  The way they let us order was strange as well. You have to put down your appetizer,  entry and desert all at once. The reason given to us was due to the amount of time required to prepared the food. I understand some stuff takes longer than others. But if you bring it to our attention and we are willing to wait, I don't see why it would be a problem. Turns out it didn't takes them long at all. The portion was tiny but we were sure if we could add on more stuff and didn't feel like to go through the process with our waiter.   Anyway, I like the taste of the food but probably will not come back because of the service and atmosphere. There are plenty of excel to choice around the city with good atmosphere and service. It is ok if you don't care about having strangers listen to your conversations, But defiantly would not recommend couples going over for a romantics date night.",

    "text": "Best. Meal. Ever.  Seriously.    J and I went for our anniversary on a Wednesday at 5:30 with resverations.  We were the only people in there and for a moment, I was mocking us for getting reservations for a Wednesday.  By 6 pm, it was packed.    I started with the bourbon.  Nicely flavored, interesting little beads of sugar and citrus that didn't add much to the drink, but looked cool.  J had an excellent beer on tap.    We ordered two appetizers cause we couldn't choose just one - the smoked trout and the chorizo.  I love anything smoked. Anything.  So I was expecting to be so wow-ed by the trout that I wasn't even going to look at the chorizo.  The trout was delicious - wrapped in a rose colored and flavored crepe with roe and pickled cauliflower.  Beautiful tastes just bursting together.  However, the chorizo was other-worldly.  It came with tomatoes and chick peas and other things that I couldn't describe.  The flavors worked perfectly together.    For our main course, I ordered the hanger steak served with a shmear of the most delightfully cheesy potatoes ever, braised butter lettuce and 3 sauces - carmelized onion jam, horseradish and dijon.  The dijon was a bit too much for my taste, but the other two were amazing.  The braised lettuce really stood out for the amount of flavor that was packed into the little leaves.  No idea how they did it and it was all the better for it.  The steak was cooked perfectly - medium rare, seared and pink in the inside.   I also asked the waitress for a drink recommendation and she discussed it with the bartender - gave me three thoughtful recommendations.  I settled on the rye whiskey - not one of my favorite things and it could not have accompanied it better.  J got the pork.  It was served with roasted carrots and onions, succulent and sweet; a pile of lentils, braised in bacon and red wine and topped with a perfectly poached egg.  Every tiny thing that was on his plate was amazing - down to the plate itself which was a beautiful piece of slate.    At $130 bucks, it was a bit steep for Pittsburgh, but I can honestly say there was never money better spent on a meal in the city.  Enjoy!",

Comfortable atmosphere with decent music in the background. OK.. caution here, this is not a place for a vegetarian or vegan. Just listen to the name, CURE, it is all about meats; cured meats.  Do NOT torture your animal loving fiends. Of Course I ordered the much renowned.  Salumi platter.  It is a combination of ciccioli, duck speck, lardo, fernet & oil cured olive, nduja.  Yeah, sounds intimidating but even if I can not pronounce much of it, my tongue LOVED IT !!!  The difference in flavors accompanied with mustard/sauces and bread was heavenly.  I could have eaten a few more platters of this cured meat delight.   I did order a small entree of oysters which were also delicious; briney with a delicious horseradish and bacon topping.  Yeah YUM.   I have to say the Salumi platter is to die for ... I even convinced them to make me one to take home.  Yeah it's that good !!! Meal is on the pricey side and portions are small.  You may still be hungry when you leave or consider ordering 2 entrees.   SO happy that I finally made it here; Ill be dreaming of the cured duck. FYI, you can BYOB but the uncorking charge is $15.00; and parking is on the street.  You may have to walk a few blocks.",

Walking in, the chef's kitchen is seated the level up from the dining room in view; it gives you the feeling of here's the chefs kitchen, relax and have fun because your going to experience some savory food. We had Salumi and beef tartare as apps, duck confit and gluttony for dinner, and ended with lemon meringue pie. Everything was so uniquely good and the portions were enough I felt. Our waitress was attentive and easy going. I felt that seating was too close to neighbors but it's not a big place. Make reservations and keep in mind that they don't unlock the doors until 5.",

    "text": "At this price point I expect to be delighted with everything, within reason of course. I think it's reasonable to expect a $35 ala carte pork loin entree to have pork loin that isn't tough and full of gristle especially if the portion is only maybe 5 or 6 ounces. Everything else about the dish was indeed perfection EXCEPT the meat. Given the trophy pigs on the wall I especially expected the pork to be the finest anywhere. I was very disappointed in that. Everything else brought to the table was fantastic in every way including the cocktail. The service was quite good. There was a mixup with the checks that was corrected by our server promptly, but it took a lot of time to do, and despite my fondness for her, I think it was an amateur mistake. I would go back; but I'm hesitant and uncertain now of the quality of their meats or their willingness to serve something tough and unsatisfying.. My dining partner cringed when I told him I was going to mention it to the server (he's skittish like that), so I left it alone, but I also noted that nobody checked in with us after the appetizer as to the quality of the meal. Again, amateur move. All of it forgivable if I were at a place that has a low bar for such things, but I don't think this place wants to set the bar at anything less than quality all around. So I left disappointed and feeling a tad like I didn't get what I paid for.",

    "text": "Our experience was not the best.  We made a reservation for 6pm on a Wednesday night.  After being seated we explained to our waitress that we were here to spend money for our party of four buying cocktails and beers and multiple courses. There was no wait and there were open tables and we were assured this wouldn't be a problem. The oddness began when 45 mins into our reservation the waitress has to check when the next reservation is coming in... we were given no indication when we made our reservation that our time would be limited, and we had made it clear that we were there to stay, so why bring it up now?   Later, one of our party asked if he could substitute potatoes for one of his sides. No substitutions allowed.  Our waitress became very confrontational when we commented that it was a weird policy especially for a high end restaurant. After that, the manager came over. We explained the issues with the  waitress and she served us the rest of the evening.  As for the food, their cured meats, which are their specialty, are truly exceptional.  But the large $40 salumi we ordered as an appetizer came with very little mustards or accompanying veggies and the crustinis were not good. Our main courses were good, but not excellent. The portions were very small for the duck and there were too many flavors on the plate. One sauce would suffice for a small duck portion. The Black Cod plate was overly salted - not what you need after salumi.  The fermented pumpkin on the pork plate was very good. The ravioli were fine but nothing special.  When asked they admitted that pasta wasnt made fresh daily but stated that was a benefit...?   Desserts: Their chocolate souffle cake was done very very well, and the pawpaw cream pie was small but very tasty, although one of the sauces didnt pair well for my palate.   Note these were the only two dessert options.  Generally speaking they have a small menu and as mentioned before you cant switch around any items for any reason.  I expected better service, flexibility and food for the $400 we spent.",

The gnudi (which is like gnocchi) was very tasty and interesting, but I would have preferred it less salty. The Le Bella Farm Duck, $27, was my entree. The menu said breast, confit and apricot tortellini, roasted pigs foot and parmesan brood, pickled celery, dandelion, burnt lemon. It was complex and quite good. Not a large portion (but that's fine). Perhaps the \"brood\" was the sauce? Overall, a nice, complex combination of tastes and textures.  I liked how the burnt lemon's flavor and the celery's texture complemented the rather-rare duck. For dessert I had the dark chocolate souffle cake. After the complexities and somewhat exotic appetizer and entree, it was nice to have something more familiar for dessert. The cake was excellent -- not too sweet, which I liked. Dinner for two (no drinks) for $91 before tip. I'd say it was worth it.  When we arrived at 5:30pm on a Thursday (no reservation) we were one of two couples dining. By 6:30, most tables were filled.  I wish they would turn down the air conditioner; it was too cold in there.",

Make sure you call well ahead for a reservation; I tried a few days in advance and they were already booked, but Jen was extremely accommodating and found a time to get us in.  I saw multiple unfortunate couples try to walk in for a table, with no success.  You should definitely start with the large salumi platter for $26.  It's not overly filling but has a lot of variety, so you will still have plenty of room for entrees.  The locally-sourced menu changes often, and the attention to detail on the plate is just about perfect.  Flavors are complex but well balanced.  This chef knows his stuff.  The lardo was awesome (I actually asked for more for \"dessert\" and their house mustards were kick-ass.  The actually had pig head on the menu (the whole friggin' head came on the plate, too) but they were already sold out by the time we ordered.  Next time hopefully.    From a design perspective, they have an open kitchen, with an overall rustic feel to the dining room.  I liked it, as it's not pretentious and you don't get the feeling that they're trying too hard.  Service was also spot on, being just attentive enough, and doing a good job of what was on the plate.    I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "4.5 Stars (round up to 5!)  I have been wanting to try Cure for awhile now.  Finally, last night (Wednesday) my boyfriend and I had a night to go.  The restaurant is on the smaller side (which I prefer), has dimmer lighting and a cabin-type feel.  We had a reservation and were quickly seated at a small table closest to the window.  My only complaint about this table is the fact that the air conditioning kept turning on and blew cold air directly at us, which made us quite chilly at times (I was glad I brought a jacket).  Overall, though, I really enjoyed the ambiance.    Although the drink menu had some fabulous cocktails, we opted to BYOB a bottle of wine (reasonable $15 corkage fee).  Next time I'll have to try one of the drinks.  For an appetizer, we ordered the Salumi, which was delicious.  I really enjoyed the duck and the porcini salami.  We also ordered the Montadito, which was also wonderful.    I ordered the squid ink & leak ask gnudi (whole portion...I debated getting the half portion), and my boyfriend ordered the duck.  I loved the gnudi.  The sauce was so flavorful and the gnudi was prepared perfectly.  I could have probably gotten away with the half portion, as my boyfriend finished the remainder of my dish (maybe next time order an extra \"snack\" off the menu and opt for the half portion).  I tasted some of my boyfriend's entree, which was nice.  It came with many sauces (some he liked and some he wasn't as fond of).    For an after dinner treat we shared an Amaro flight.  I honestly don't recall what they were (we let the bar tender pick 3 out for us).  They had a wide range of tastes.  One of them was delicious, one was okay, and the last one, well, I wasn't crazy about it.  The service was good.  I could have used a little more explanation for the menu.  However, each dish was perfectly timed (salumi first, then the mantadito, entrees and then desert).  Our waiter was friendly and nice.   It was definitely a more expensive meal out, but well worth it.  We've spent almost as much at restaurants/bars ordering bar food and beers.  Overall, fantastic food and a fun time.  We will be back!",

    "text": "My foodie best friend and I visited Cure as a birthday celebration and were not disappointed. The cocktails were STRONG...but I'm not a connosieur of whiskey or bourbon, so I can't really rate them on taste.  Presentation however..spectacular.  We arrived for a 7:00 reservation and were seated promptly.  It was a packed house, but our waitress was very attentive and we didn't feel crowded or rushed at all.  We ordered the small salumi appetizer as well as the mesclun salad, and both were delicious.  The mesclun salad was by far our favorite, with the roasted beets, whipped chevre and peanut brittle, it was a unique change of pace from the typical summer salad.  We split the main entree \"gluttony of pork\" and used words like \"wow\" \"what is this?\" and \"OMG\" after every bite.  The flavors were amazing, the pork was prepared perfectly, and it was just delicious.  To complete our dining experience we tried the dark chocolate cake and the cheese plate.  The dark chocolate cake was delicious, but not that original really, and the same goes for the cheese plate.  Both were delicious, but not necessary for a great experience.  I'd go back in a heartbeat, and am thrilled to have a restaurant like Cure to provide different culinary experiences for adventurous Pittsburghers!",

The Foie Blonde and Veal Short Rib Terrine was something special, an appetizer and dessert all at once. Savory, sweet, and rich with beautifully layered spice.  This was followed up with Lake Ontario Walleyed Pike, the fish was delicately firm and pleasantly moist and rich, perfectly accompanied with buttery sauce. Who knew Lake Ontario had such delicious fish to offer?  We also had some Rabbit and Gnocchi. The highlight of this dish for me were the gnocchi, which were moist and fluffy inside and nicely crisp and browned outside.  Finally, the Dark Chocolate Souffle Cake is a phenomenal salty, savory dessert. Very little sweetness, just salty, rich, chocolaty decadence.",

Our pleas to turn it down fell on deaf ears (pun intended). I would not go back if the food had been fabulous, and it was not. I will not lie: the oysters were delicious and beautifully presented, and my cocktail (one of 16 offered; who can decide among so many in the time allotted?) was lovely and tasty. My husband's salmon crudo was tasty and tiny. My pasta with chanterelle mushrooms was a complete miss. The delicate flavor of the mushrooms was completely overpowered by the salty cheese grated on top of the dish. My husband and the fellow with us had the hanger steak. Rubber was the word most used to describe it. It's not the tenderest of cuts but it was super tough. The woman with us ordered the squab and got a half of one. We all went home hungry, and we will not return.",

Everything was delicious. The second trip there were a few more menu options, and our group especially enjoyed the spring pea ravioli (even the carnivores wanted more!). The best dinner by far though was a special Sunday Supper, featuring 4 courses highlighted by the best-ever giant sausagey meatballs served with polenta and fresh basil. Only giving four stars because I've never been wowed by the somewhat passive service - and once had a bad service moment though I believe it was an anomaly. Looking forward to my next visit.",

However we left not feeling as if we would return any time soon.  The space is beautiful!   Real barn wood  as well as authentic Lawrenceville hip.  A great choice of music. Unfortunately  the music was so loud we found we needed to shout to hear each other.  When asked to turn it down a bit, the waitress explained the chef liked it loud.  May I suggest a speaker be installed in the kitchen area so those of us dining may speak in a voice appropriate for intimate dining.  We were offered family style dining as we were such a large group.  We all dine out often so we know this is always a great choice.   Again, the food was prepared to perfection; however we  were given such meager portions.  The waitress misrepresented the pricing, as well as the courses.   When we questioned the cost/courses, we were told there was a misunderstanding but no one offered to correct the issue.     The food at Cure is excellent, but there needs to be some tweaking to earn more than three stars.",

    "text": "Having eaten at Cure twice now, I'd have to make the argument for it as the city's best restaurant. The only thing potentially holding it back is that it's BYOB, so you can't get the cocktail experience that a place like Spoon, for example, can provide. But based on the food alone, I'd give it the edge over some of the others typically mentioned in that discussion (aka, Salt, Spoon, etc.).  My wife and I were there as a group of 6 on Saturday and it was superb from beginning to end. Salumi plate was fantastic. Chilled celery soup appetizer, with lobster jelly and big lobster chunks, was insanely good. I'd say the same about the heirloom tomato salad with pine nut brittle and this other-worldly creamy dressing and the beef tartare with chili and chocolate, two sauces, and what I believe was a freeze-dried hazelnut crumble (the sauces were great, but really the tartare was awesome on its own).  Hangar steak was perfectly cooked, the best piece of roasted chicken I've ever had (with pesto and polenta and a hung chunk of bacon - more like pork belly - and warmed peaches), an interesting take on a carbonara with an egg served in the plate alongside big pieces of pasta and peas and bacon, for the diner to incorporate.   Only two deserts, but both got raves (I only tasted the chocolate cake).  I've heard complaints about the noise, but both times I did not find it to be an issue. It was pretty warm inside and by the time we left, 2.5 hours after we arrived, we were pretty hot. It WAS the hottest day of the year and Cure does have an open kitchen and probably not the most modern AC/ventilation system, so I'll cut it some slack.  In any case, if you've got the resources or can save up, get to Cure. It is awesome.",

I tried my son's dish and I am sold on this chef.  This is not chile or barbecue - it is distinctly delicious.  My wife dared try the swordfish (if not raw, typically overcooked), and I was interested when I saw they did the bag method.  This is the only hope for decent swordfish and it was outstanding as well.  This chef may rival Jose Garces in Philly, but everything is much more affordable and a BYO.

For the most part this was fine, although service seemed somewhat of an afterthought for these seats.    My main problem was the food.  I had a tasteless green garlic and dandelion soup to start.  The meyer lemon panna cotta cubes were the highlight and the only part that had any flavor.  Even the trout roe was bland and flabby, not briny and crisp.  For an entree I ordered the squab and pork belly.  There was about a 30 minute gap between the soup and my main course even though the restaurant wasn't full.  I was told the squab was served medium rare; however, my squab can only be described as raw.  It was so undercooked that I tried one bite and left the rest untouched.  The pork belly was fine but at this point everyone and their dog is serving pork belly.  The falafel that accompanied the dish really didn't mesh.  The block of wood that served as a plate came across as an affectation (I should have looked around for the garage sale record player currently popular in these types of restaurants).

    "text": "Stopped in Cure for their inaugural Sunday brunch, a $35/pp fixed course BYOB affair. I had heard much about Cure, but as I usually hang around vegetarians I had never been, so I was eager to see if it lived up to the hype.  The restaurant is small and has a fairly casual interior. Mostly wood, with various butchering tools and hog paraphernalia lining the walls as decor. The  music playing was good(a lot of Nirvana, among other things), but probably a little loud as it could be hard to hear over it at times. They had a small table set up for the self-serve drinks, with carafes of OJ for mimosas(or just drinking juice), and Clarion River Organics spicy bloody mary mix(with celery, pickled, asparagus, and a few other garnishes).  After we arrived it took a while for a waiter to greet us, maybe because we were still staring at the (lone) menu at the table, but at some point it would have been nice to get a hello and a more detailed rundown of the options. We put in our order - there were 4 appetizer and 4 entree selections,and 3 desserts - smoked salmon, antipasti, and strawberry gazpacho for the appetizers, 2 hangar steaks & eggs, and a duck confit benedict for entrees, and one of each dessert(cheese board, chocolate souffle, and a lemon-rhubarb parfait).  Simply put, the food was fantastic. Simple, but perfect, with amazing ingredients. I can't recall most of the names of the items on the antipasti plate, but I cleaned it with ease. The salmon also stood out, with the plate lined with Harissa yogurt making a perfectly balanced dish. The entrees too, were fantastic - the duck confit being the best I'd ever had(of the 2 or 3 times I've had it), all eggs being perfectly prepared, and the hangar steak being absolutely the best piece of red meat I've ever tasted, hands down.  Dessert and coffee came out afterwards, again all were delicious, the souffle stood out as being particularly tasty, and the coffee was great too, served with a large hunk of brown sugar on the side for dipping to the correct amount.   We chatted a bit with our waitress about the upcoming events(Hog butchering, an Italian BBQ, dinner with notion) - Cure holds them often, having a whole chalkboard full of over 10 for this summer. The whole meal took nearly 2 hours to complete, and I felt like we received plenty of food(in response to many people I've heard claiming they left hungry at dinner time).  I'd definitely like try Cure for dinner, I think the food certainly lives up to the hype. They are still fairly new, so I believe they may still have some dining room kinks to work out, but definitely don't let that keep you from trying this awesome spot.",

    "text": "Told us they were wheelchair friendly on the phone, but there is a step and if you use a power chair, you are not getting in this place without a portable ramp.  The staff was very insistent that it was ADA, which is always surprising and more than a little outrageous when you then find an actual step to get inside, with a narrow door on an incline that opens the wrong way for a chair.  When you are meeting friends and that happens, it kind of leaves a crummy taste in your mouth-- that doesn't taste like wonderful cured meats!  I left an angry phone message and they did respond to me, so I give them an extra star for that.  We really want to go here but Lawrenceville in general is pretty tough in a chair, and although some places believe that equal access is important, there are many places like Cure in old buildings that don't care to update entranceways to accommodate.  I understand it can cost a few thousand dollars plus a few minutes of research to see what is required, which must be difficult for one of the most successful restaurants in the city.  Some places are doing it right, so there's that at least.  I hope one day they change it because we really want to go here even with the mediocre attitude toward accessibility!",

The atmosphere is great, and feels just like a trendy restaurant in the middle of NYC.  The staff was fantastic, very friendly.    The apps and entrees are creative and delicious.  For apps, our table ordered the salumi and cheese plates, as well as the carbonara ravioli.  The carbonara sauce was amazing - unbelievably light and smooth, with small pieces of crunchy bacon and peas tossed in.  For dinner, I ordered the duck entree, and haven't had a better duck dish in a long, long time.  My favorite aspect of the dish was the knotweed, which I had not had before.  It was slightly bitter and sweet, and was grilled perfectly.  I'm looking forward to returning soon, especially for one of Cure's special events.  (Also, when you go to the bathroom, you get a great look at the kitchen.  Bonus!)",

The space is really beautiful (I personally don't care for dead things on the walls but other than that I like the antique-y comfy vibe).  I've been twice within the last few months.  First time it took some time to get our reserved table but that was ok cause I got to hang out at the bar and get to chat with lovely bartender, who made some great recommendations.  I love the cocktails there because they aren't overly sweet and the flavors are really unique.  I got the cup which is probably one of the most unique drinks I've ever had.  The service is really great and I love looking into the kitchen.  The second time I went I got to sit at the bar over looking the kitchen and see them meticulously putting together the food.  I had the Duck Confit.  I've been eating duck my whole life and for a Chinese person to say this is the best duck I've ever had is saying a lot!  So completely delicious.  Really good portion size.  Everything on the plate was delicious.  My friend got the Gluttony.  Gorgeous plates which we cleaned with glee!  Serious foodie stuff.  For dessert we had the Chocolate souffle (sweet and salt meeting together on a plate so good) and Lemon Meringue pie which we destroyed.  I will be remembering this meal for a long time!  Seriously delicious place!  Thank you Cure for being so awesome!",

    "text": "My wife arranged a dinner at Cure Saturday night for a group of 8.  Condiering this was only their third weekend open,  Bravo!  First, let me say Celine and I are a fan of Justin Severino from his time at Element.  Greatly appreciate his curing abilities and culinary palate.  Everyone at the table did a tasting menu.  It wasn't planned that way, but after the salumi platter of his cured delicacies, then a polenta dish of savory cheese, pancetta and quick fried kale, Justin had us hooked.   We all decided to just let him prepare our meal.    Next came his sunchoke soup.  I do not recall each ingredient, but the only word to express the table's agreed upon description, sublime.  Folowing was a the evenings, fish selection, walleye pike.  This wasnt the thin pike fillets you find at your grocer.  It's crispy skin and succulent flesh were complimented by the bordelaise and hollandaise sauces, served with smoked potatoes and sugary carmelized shallots.  The roast rib of pork was juicy and tender, and his cassoulet was to die for, with the flavors of boudin blanc, chicken, and duck vying for attention in the delicious broth full of canneloni beans.  Too bad to say, we could not find room for desert or the cheese selection.  I greatly appreciate the fact that Cure only offers a handful of  appetizers, and four entree selections.  This assures the diner of getting only the freshest ingredients on hand and the chef's personal attention to detail.  Saturday night was Cassoulet, Beef Cheeks, Pork rib roast, and walleye pike.  something for everyone.  The corkage fee is reasonable.  The wait staff was impressively trained for such a new restuarant.  The manager Sarah should also be commended for the smooth operation of this new gem to our city.    The only reason I did not give Cure a 5th star, was the music.  An incredible selection of tunes but too loud for a 50 year old with some hearing issues. (probalbly a result of listening to most of the music played that evening too loud in college)    I cant wait to return.",

The bartender was very helpful and gave us a couple of tastes of his favorite vodkas and gin.  The salumi plate was top notch--my favorite being the chorizo-like paste.  We also had the lightly fried pig skins, which were a great accompaniment for the salumi.  For dinner I had the sea bass.  Although it was very tasy with a cauliflower sauce, it was heavier than I anticipated.  My bad because most fo the dishes here tend to be on the heavier side.  P.S.  The oysters on the half shell were about as fresh as I have ever had.",

    "text": "I did not enjoy Cure nearly as much as I thought I would: the cocktails were a miss, they were out of too many things by 8:30, and -- most importantly -- the food (at least what I tried) was a bit of a disappointment.   I did love the atmosphere here. Cozy, interesting decor, dim lights, fits very nicely into Lawrenceville.   The bf and I tried two cocktails: I had a sparkling wine with kirsch and black currant, which turned out too sour and with a really over-powering aftertaste. It had a strong kick to it, but not in a good way for a sparkling cocktail. He tried a a coffee & egg cocktails reminiscent of a coffee flip, except all you could taste in this one was coffee, coffee, and then some coffee.   The salumi was pretty nice, but when we ran out of bread they refused to bring us extra because they were running low. It was 8:30 and salumi is their most popular dish, so I was surprised.   The beef tartare was ok, it had a bit of an asian twist to it, but nothing to write home about. I definitely prefer the one at Salt, for example. My personal preference is that beef tartare come with something crunchy, but this one did not.  They were out of their pig dish, so I got Gluttony -- two types of sausage and a croquette, plus sauerkraut and fingerling potatoes. The sides were OK, the sausage was more than underwhelming. Think of the kind of brat you get on the street in Germany for 1 euro, and that's what this was like, except the dish was priced at over $30.  I know a lot of people really enjoy Cure, so maybe I just had a particularly poor experience. I am not very likely to go back anytime soon, though.",

Why Cure is hands down one of my new favorite restaurants:  - The atmosphere is great- super rustic, unique, woodsy, creative- they have put intention into every detail and it shows.  - The salumi plate was SO good; however, while they did great at explaining what each thing was there were so many options that our party didn't know what we were eating at any given time; maybe put little flags in each choice so people can know what they are eating...?  - The food was DELICIOUS; in our big party we pretty much tried everything on the menu and everyone was blown away.  - They were great about plating/serving our cupcakes; I was a little put off that they told us (multiple times) that they were going to charge $2 per person to serve the cupcakes, which I find to be a little ridiculous when you're already bringing in a party of 7 with $30 entrees each, but in the end they didn't end up charging us for it.  - The service was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable.   Needless to say, Cure is doing a great job and they provided for a wonderful birthday experience- I can't wait to go back again.",

    "text": "Before I begin, I want to say that I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience. It was really, really great.   It was weird! But in the best way. No negative connotations should be inferred from the word 'weird'. I ordered oysters and asked for horseradish and Tabasco as they do on the gulf shore, and the server said, in a very well mannered way, that they do not have those condiments. I was disappointed. Then the oysters came and the condiment was some kind of lavender concoction. I thought 'what is this stuff?'. Answer: condensed angel tears. Freaking phenomenal. What have I been doing to my oysters all this time? So much wasted potential. Much shameful. Very regret. Wow.  Then I ordered the salumi. Tasty, but I've had that before. Top notch, but like I said, this was not 'weird' and therefore, slightly less memorable. That being said, if you like salumi this is the best place for it in the area I know of.  Main courses were rib eye and duck. My wife had the latter. My rib eye was the most ridiculously 'weird' thing I have eaten in a long time. I ate every bite. I wish I could cook like that. The server put some oil or sauce or something on it. He told me what it was but I was 2 or three 'bourbon' mixed drinks in (also really good) and I cannot remember what it was. Similarly, I don't remember the contents of the main course although I remember the flavor/textures. This is the sour/crunchy stuff that is the sweet/smooshy stuff. It also had a sesame oil flavor that was pervasive. Lastly a 'slow cooked egg'. What is that? Answer: ambrosia stolen from the cup of god. Okay, perhaps hyperbole but you understand.   All I can say is if it were less pretentious, I would walk in and yell 'surprise me!', and eat what ever was brought to me until I needed a wheelbarrow to take me to my special uberX flatbed I had worked out a month in adavance.  TL:DR: weird and awesome.",

My husband and I scheduled a date night with cocktails at Allegheny Wine Mixer (highly recommend!) and then over to Cure for dinner.   We started with the small salumi plate, which was excellent. If ordering a salumi plate, I recommend trying the olive focaccia . A great complement to the cured meat platter. We then sampled the beef tartare and scallop crudo. I loved the presentation and preparation of the beef tartare. Typically, you receive this dish sliced thin with egg or olive oil. Cure's version is a beef tartare lettuce wrap, served in cups of butter lettuce. It was fabulous! I liked this dish so much, that the scallop crudo was forgettable. For entrees, my husband and I split the rib eye and the squid ink gnudi with smoked lamb. Other than the beef tartare, the squid ink pasta was my favorite part of the meal. Highly recommend this dish!   Overall, we had a great experience at Cure. I'm not convinced it entirely lived up to the hype, but it certainly was an excellent meal. I went in with high expectations, and left feeling satisfied, but not \"wow-ed.\" Next up, I can't wait to try Morcilla!",

However, my local friends who had been there before were unenthused with the prospect of going again, but agreed since it was my in town choice. I did not enjoy my experience at all.  Very crowded and loud, which would be okay if the food made it worth the atmosphere.  It did not.  The cocktails were well drinks spruced up with a splash of wine and fruit.  The bread and butter was okay but overpriced, which pretty much sums up the entire meal.  Large salumi- ehhh... it was okay I guess.   I got the carbonara. There were a couple pieces of pork bits, but not the amount that should be in a dish from a place that specializes in cured meats.  It was reminiscent of a watered down tuna noodle casserole with small pieces of pork in place of the fish.  I was very hungry and could not force myself to eat all of the soupy dish where peas were the main ingredient.  If I hadn't ordered it, I would never have guessed it was carbonara.  The taste, texture and peas  bore no resemblance to any carbonara I have had in the United States or Sicily.   I asked the friends I went with  what they thought of their food as I was writing this.  They forgot what they got, which is not the best review of a meal as expensive as this one.",

What Cure didn't manage to do is leave me with that \"OMG that was the best meal of my life!\" feeling.  Perhaps blame it on the overall spectacular reviews or the intense hype that everyone I know who has gone gave it, but I simply didn't fall in love with this joint.  Also, as a few others have noted, CURE IS NO LONGER BYOB.  This hasn't seemed to reach the masses as ourselves and four other tables came wine/beer in tow only to be turned down upon arrival.  We started by splitting the large salumi plate, which represented set a great tone to the wife and I's dinner, but ultimately all started to taste the same (I blame the high fat content and lack of enough palate cleansing items... i.e. acidic pickles, etc.).  Both of our meals were good.  The wife's chicken and cornbread tasted fine, but both were a little dry.  On the server's recommendation, I went with the \"gluttony\", for the pure \"Cure experience\", and was presented with probably the best item of the night...  unique preparations of a variety of pig parts (cheek, feet, etc.) that were well balanced with accompanying sauces, foams, etc.  We went for a chocolate souffle for dessert, and while the souffle was well executed from a technique perspective, it left a lot to be desired.  Service was on par.  Not bad, but definitely not great for the price point.  Overall, I'll definitely go back to Cure at some point, but I'm not dying to do so anytime soon.",

So, if you are a vegetarian, you can still visit this place and the chef will make you a vegetarian dish! The whole dining experience was great, we had a small salumi plate, La Bella Farm Duck, and Jubilee Hilltop Farm Ribeye. For the dessert, we had Dark Chocolate Souffle Cake wit pistachio butter which was just amazing! The cocktails we had (bourbon and negroni) were great too. The only problem here is finding a reservations (if you don't have a reservation, chances are you can't dine there. Also the bar is so small, it doesn't make sense to sit there and wait. You have the option of going to wine mixer near by and stay there until your table is ready).",

It came with different sauces to try and he complimented them all.  For our meals, I ordered the pesto pasta and it was amazing! The sauce was so warm and it melted in my mouth! The only reason I would not order it, is if it was not on the menu (They change the menu seasonally!). My boyfriend ordered the hangar steak and it was also very delicious! It was cooked perfectly! Everything was wonderful! The service was awesome! Everyone was very friendly. They had a great crowd for a sunday evening! Definitely make a reservation before going here!",

We had piled 6 cards on the check to have the check be split evenly (not even by individual persons order). She seemed annoyed and said that she wasn't sure if they could do it. 20 minutes went by without word. Finally a man showed up with our checks. He dropped them off, again without a single word.  We signed our tabs and left.  Our waitress didn't speak to us the last 30 minutes we were there, didn't thank us for coming in, or anything.

Our tap water was warmer than room temp and not good. How could they not add ice to the glass, beats me? He didn't like it, so he ordered sparkling water. When the bill comes to $86, it would be nice to just have a cold glass of water.  We ordered the small charcuterie plate, he, the pork belly and I the pappardelle. He liked the pork belly with the soft egg, but not crazy about the kimchi veggies. He said the basil oil was a \"plate filler\" since there was hardly any food on the plate. He also noticed there was a bunch of cilantro on there too for aesthetics. He thought the basil with cilantro was a little too much as both didn't go well with the pork. Perhaps basil and rosemary oil?  My pappardelle was ok-a little salty. The chanterelles were substantial, but overall, underwhelming. If you want sublime pasta, head down the street to Piccolo Forno-the best in Pittsburgh!  As we carried on with our night, my husband and I just didn't feel \"right\". When we got home, we both were, uh, let's say \"effervescent/bubbly\" and spent time in the bathroom.  I'm not sure what happened, but we can say we tried Cure, but won't be returning.",

I went on January 16, 2014 for dinner and it was pleasant as always.  First, the ambiance in the restaurant is comforting and chic.  It's hipster-rustic, with some animal heads on the wooden walls.    Now that the restaurant has a liquor license, I started at the bar with a cocktail.  I had a delicious rye whiskey cocktail made with, amongst other things, lambrusco and a sprig of rosemary.  As a rye whiskey lover, this was simply beautiful.  Colin the bartender does a great job.  For appetizer, I had the crab fondue, which included lemongrass butter, pickled ginger, black garlic, grapefruit, avocado, shishito peppers, sesame, and bull's blood.  It was simply amazing and had a nice light taste, while still being satisfying and filling.  For the main course, I had the hanger steak, which was done medium rare to perfection.  It was complemented with smoked butter, black pepper, and herbs, and the dish was completed with caramelized onion, potato-celery root gratin, sweet garlic cream, spinach, and tarragon pickled shallots.  The potato-celery root gratin was delicious, and aside from the meat was my favorite part of the entire meal.  I could eat that every day.  It was creamy but not too creamy, and had a perfect texture.  The meat had a wonderful texture as well.  I had a glass of Malbec with dinner and it was great.  I wish I had remembered the winery.  Bottom line:  Justin Severino is doing tremendous things with Cure.  If I could drop $80 (with booze and tip) on dinner every week, I would be there every week without fail.  I recommend it to everyone.  RUN TO CURE.  Thanks!",

Maybe we just ordered the 'wrong' dishes but we seemed to like the place less and less after each course.  We started off with the Montadito and Chicharrones. Both were good dishes and the Montadito was excellent and flavorful. 4-5 stars for appetizers. We continued with pasta dishes. The Spaghetti Carbonara was good. The Gnocchi was definitely too small for $26 and was rather croquettes than gnocchi. The braised beef that came with it was done well. 3-4 stars for the pasta dishes.  Desert was disappointing. The Pot De Creme came with a crumble that didn't add to the dish. The Creme was sweet and flavorful but having the crumble with it made it rather bland. The Chocolate cake was moist but just wasn't a good match with the olive oil drizzle. 2 stars for desert.   The atmosphere is very nice and service is good. Sad the meal didn't match up this time.",

But despite the sludge of this evolution, the deepening dark behind its motives, there lies a brilliant spark dahn there in Larryville. Cure is the kind of spot you propose in.

    "text": "I've lived behind this place for several years, through all of the hype, and while we did set foot inside once, never stayed.  With no ideas in mind, and desiring a great place to go on the B-day, I convinced everyone to take me out to Cure boasting it was \"one of the finest restaurants in the country\".  Yes, totally hyped and not very good.  I had a much harsher review in mind when I was at the table, but I figure just giving them one star is enough.  I'm a foodie.  I like the fact that they cure their own meats, but now that I've had them I can't say it was a mind blowing experience.  This restaurant does not deserve to be in the top 20 in the USA.    I understand you shouldn't expect the same sort of culinary experience from a restaurant like this that you would at a corporate experience, but one thing I found extremely lacking was the main course.  For $29, you expect more than a dressed up duck leg with \"inklings\" of sides.  The chef must have been out of the office that night because the preparations were all very messy.   As we sat down we were immediately offered \"water or a sparkling water\", not realizing we were ordering a bottle of sparkling water for $5.  Waitress #1 offered me a sample of the \"smoky porter\", but didn't give me a chance to try it before she returned within 1 minute to ask if I was happy with it.  Immediately, she realized her mistake.  I just felt rushed in the beginning, so if she or her manager reads this, she needs to build rapport and relax a bit, we were obviously there for the long haul not a quick lunch, I mean c'mon we had reservations.  First, we ordered the signature \"Large\" salumi board.  It looked nothing like the pictures on Yelp.  The thing was piled high with stuff, but the stuff was all haphazard and they buried the mustards and just jumbled everything up, unlike the pictures.  The girl who was describing what each of the items were just couldn't figure out what the stuff was anyway, because it was all mixed up and messy.  The crostini was store-bought right out of a bag they probably bought at one of the Italian groceries, and was _not_ made in-house.   Huge disappointment the choke-on-this crostini and the lowest quality item we received.  It was so dark we had to use our phones to even see the food.  Other tables did the same, the place is so dark you're eating grey and brown splotches from the darkness and have no idea what the visual quality of the items are until you turn to flash photography.  What a waste of 20% of the senses.  For an Italian-American-owned, Mediterranean-themed place it doesn't deliver anywhere near the quality of a real Italian place.  We left hungry, my father joking he never got his main course.  He said he enjoyed his fish but couldn't identify the rest of the meal and so he didn't eat it.  I realize Pops is a meat-and-potatoes kind of guy, but I agree the small portions were not the croix of the problem -- or at least not the only one.  My girlfriend mentioned to me that the founder, Severino, refused to friend her on Instagram.  We took a look at it.  The food he makes for himself looks to have way better portioning and is just more visible than anything he serves at his restaurant.  If I had received a typical meal he makes for himself, I probably wouldn't have felt so cheated out of the $29 for what was basically a deep-fried duck leg.    My main course: duck leg deep-fried and crispy. (Confit) Great, but there was little else on the plate other than that awful trendy way chefs splooge their purees.  Whomever made my plate decided that the \"espresso horseradish sauce\" that was supposed to surround the duck should be the main color in the palette, because there was more of that than there was anything else.  And let's be honest, it's the horse-sh!t sauce: brown, chunky and smeared.  It tasted like a fresh horse radish dressing you would have for way less money somewhere else.  If you want to know what it was like from a culinary standpoint, the consistency and color just happened to be exactly like what you would see in a dirty diaper.    ( <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fusercontent1.hubimg.com%2F2216782.jpg&s=9bb6fe444dd7694cafc14733eda8f54c02b874386f1f14936698848d2f9e6ab6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">usercontent1.hubimg.com/...</a> )  Mash potatoes with your $29 duck leg?  No, just a tablespoon full of white puree probably made in a Vitamix blender.  After listing all 20 or whatever ingredients / purees / whatever the heck pretentious dipsh!ts call this crap-fu, the \"other\" waitress couldn't answer a simple question I had about the green smear near my duck.  I asked \"is this a puree made from garlic or are these chunks of cheese?\"  She said she had no idea but both.  For the $200 we spent on the truncated dinner (table of four), we could have feasted on the same great farm-to-table food in the comfort of my own home. All in all, the options are low, the goop on the plate is not enough food, the flavors while complex are not all that interesting, and aside from the fact that they cure their own meat, all they're really there for is to drain your wallet and soak you in pretension.",

    "text": "I had only one expectation coming here.  That it was going to blow my mind and...it sure did!  I am in no way a connoisseur of cured meats.  I actually wasn't fully aware of what the True meaning was.  As our server explained it to us, it's the process of using the entire animal for the meal and then curing it by adding spices, smoking it or preserving it for later in salt.  You could say I almost went into this blindly...but the other yelpers reviews don't lie!  We started off with two meat and cheese platters: Salami -lardo, mortadella, pate campagola, ciccioli, chicken rillettes, cornichon, mustard, red onion, pickles and beets PA Farmstead Cheeses - stone meadow, crottin de chevre, commonfolk, blue misty river, midnight dream and candied prunes  I was surprised to like the chicken rillettes the most (I'm not the biggest chicken fan).  It seemed to have the most flavor to me.  The mustard was AWESOME! I wanted to slather it on everything! I also enjoyed the homemade pickled pickles (heehee), beets and onions.  I really liked the crottin de chevre because I like hard and sharp cheeses more than the softer ones.  It was an awesome combo with the light honey drizzle and the candied prunes.  Can you believe I've never had a prune?  The thought of them scared me, but it was delicious!  Since I've never been to a place like this before I wasn't too sure what to order for dinner.  I just picked the meat I thought sounded best, which was the duck.  I'm not lying when I took my first bite and my first thought was \"orgasmic!\"  Seriously folks, the duck was so tender and succulent with a crisp and incredibly well seasoned outside.  I had devoured the first slice of duck before I realized I hadn't cut off the fat...oops.  First thought was I should cut the rest off....eh...whatever it's all incredible, I'm downing the whole package baby!    I also loved the spaetzle, melted cabbage, mustard and apple combo it came with.  I'm a huge cabbage fan and the flavors were just incredible again.  I would have licked my plate if I could, next best thing was leaving not a morsel left.    The finale of our meal was the chocolate souffle cake with pistachio butter.  I will say, I do not usually like chocolate cake but this was again orgasmic and a total party in my mouth.  Just so moist with a perfect balance of chocolate so that it wasn't too rich.  And the pistachio butter, incredible!  Can I get that in a jar to go please?  It gets better though!  It's BYOB, so bring your fave bottle!  Reservations are a must, as it's a tiny place.  I have to also add that service was incredible and my water glass never fell below the halfway point.  The servers also were super descriptive with the menu and helped make our decisions easier.  I so appreciate good service...you could just tell they enjoyed what they were doing and were totally into the food!  I mean, who wouldn't at this point!",

    "text": "I'm not quite sure where to start with Cure, because overall, it was a great, wonderful experience.  I think I'm going to start with the staff. Everyone was amazing and they are a TEAM--everyone was helping everyone. Our server, Janelle, might possibly be one of my favorite servers ever. She was very cool and very relaxed and had a great serving style. The food runners were very knowledgable and gave great descriptions and information for each and every dish. The hostess/manager(?) was friendly and came over to chat with us for a bit. They have a good thing going here.  The cocktails here are phenomenal. I went with the gin daisy. It was herbal, refreshing, and most importantly, delicious. The wines by the glass are nice as well. My partner had the Carmenere and it was lovely.  Now onto the most important part, the food. Almost everything was delicious. If you are going to a place called Cure, you simply must order one of the salumi plates. They have a small and they have a large. The large is LARGE. The small was the perfect amount for the two of us, especially with us ordering quite a bit of food. The steak tartare is absolutely amazing. It is served with a 30 year aged balsamic (if only there were more of it...) and this powdered brown butter. So unique.  My favorite part of the meal might have been the roasted sunchoke and almond soup. It was so good to the point where I can't even describe it. I sound dramatic, but it is True. Please try it. It's poured tableside, which I always enjoy.  Next we had the half size of each and every pasta: carbonara, veal cheek ravioli, and squid ink gnudi. The first two were great. We did not care for the squid ink gnudi. Not because it wasn't good, but because it was our first time having squid ink infused pasta and we discovered that we don't like squid ink infused pasta. It gives the pasta a fishy taste. Just a forewarning. The setup for the gnudi was great though--bolognese and basil. Their bolognese is incredible and the best I have had. The basil was a nice compliment to the dish.  We had the strip steak as our entree. We feel that this was the weakest part of the meal. The steak was cooked beautifully and to perfection. We just weren't wowed by the rest of the dish, except for the cubed potatoes.   Cure does dessert okay. They have a very limited selection--only two--so we ordered both, the dark chocolate souffle cake and the citrus everything. They were okay. I preferred the cake and my partner preferred the citrus everything.",

The degree of transparency here is awesome. You can even sit at a table alongside the kitchen which is similar to bar seating at a sushi restaurant.  They have what seems to be a large selection of craft cocktails and wines. As a beer guy, I was excited to see only local, craft options on draft.  The food was outstanding! We started with the Salumi and beef tartar. There was soooo much flavor. On the Salumi board, each meat, mustard, and pate had a unique and intricate flavor. I enjoyed all of the samplings. The beef tartar was excellent too! It came with chimichurri  and a couple of other sauces. Again, there were so many levels of flavor. Honestly, I had a tough time keeping up with all of the tastes.  And when I thought the dinner couldn't get any better, the main entrees were served, we split the lobster sagu and veal. The pasta in the sagu was super fresh. I am very surprised to find myself saying that it was one of the best pastas I have ever had. The sauce, goat cheese, hearts, and nuts made for great compliments in the sagu.  Yet somehow, the best thing I ate all night was the veal. It was cooked perfectly. Literally perfect. The outside had a beautiful char while the inside was a medium rare leaning on the rare side. It came with mashed potatoes, a mustard sauce as well as a few other compliments. This dish worked very well in unison.  I believe Cure is the best restaurant for dinner in Pittsburgh of the restaurants I have dined at hitherto.",

    "text": "I've been back a few times to Cure since my initial rating and can confirm that I am a fan. On my recent outing I brought my husband here for dinner - he had yet to dine at Cure which I found shocking since he goes out often to eat. We split the beef tartare and then I had a half plate of the Pigs Blood Papardelle and a half plate of the Gnudi with a glass of red wine (2012 Ch. Les Gravieres de la Brandille Superieur). The beef tartare was the bomb, I highly recommend getting that for an app. As for the pastas, I figure two halfs add up to a whole entree and I wanted to try a few! However to be honest I would have been fine with just a half portion particularly the Gnudi. The Gnudi was my favorite of the two - I'm glad our waitress provided details on the dish as I would have been so stuffed with a whole portion. There's a lot of lamb that covers the bottom of the plate and then just a few gnocchi like balls on top with a spoonful of ricotta (versus a lot of pasta and little meat). I love carbonara and even make it myself but thought I should try the papardelle since I've never had anything like that before. The papardelle was interesting to say the least and I wouldn't order it again. To top off our meal I had a hot chocolate which was tasty but also quite rich so after a decadent meal I could not finish the entirety of it. That being said our waitress was friendly and provided great service. We can't wait to return to Cure and as well try out their sister restaurant.",

Really charming, warm, intimate setting.  The service 3/5. Our waiter was ok, but played it a little too cool for my taste. With high prices, I expect a certain level of professionalism. Maybe I'm too used to the way New York City restaurants run, but this was a tad disappointing.   The food 3/5. Food was just good. From a flavor standpoint, nothing really excited me. It wasn't bad, but wasn't anything I'd crave to have again.   Would I ever go back? Maybe, but I wouldn't actively seek it out again. Everyone else in Pittsburgh seems to love it, so perhaps I went on a bad night. Or maybe it's the type of place people claim to love because its expensive and everyone else does.",

I think they've figured out what works and doesn't and more or less stick to the things that do work. Longer ago you'd sometimes get an entree that was just too experimental and didn't mesh. This is not to say that what they have isn't inventive--it is! Great cooking. Especially recommend the charcuterie. One of the best I've had anywhere and it varies from time to time as well. Also the Hangar Steak is a great preparation.",

I just wanted to update my last review based on one menu item that may look skeptical to some.  I know the menu changes pretty often, but I just wanted to point it out in case its still there.  It's a truffle risotto for $30.  I know what you are thinking because I thought it to.  Risotto for $30!!  That's insane; it better be the best truffle risotto on this side of the Mississippi.  Well, it is.  It came out in a large helping and shaved truffles came on top of it covering the risotto so thick that all you saw was black and no white from the risotto underneath.  Well worth the $30 if you are on the fence.",

    "text": "I've never felt so rushed and disliked at a restaurant before. The whole experience was weird and rushed. We've been coming here since it opened....I remember a time when you didn't even need a reservation on a Friday night and they took time to greet you, talk about the menu, and answer questions. I moved away 2 years ago and recently met a few friends here on a Thursday night. We were most excited to get the charcuterie board that we all fondly remembered being awesome. The charcuterie board (which is now $55) did not have cheese and was not filled with awesome deliciousness like we remembered. The focaccia bread appetizer did not taste homemade...it was just blah...could get better at Market District. We asked if there was a separate cheese board we should order....the waitress who made us feel uncomfortably awkward from the moment we arrived said yes and then brought us out a beet plate....with no cheese. The waitress gave horrible dinner recommendations -- the pastas she recommended were pasty al dente and not True al dente and mine had something gritty in it like sand. The waitress never smiled and never explained any of the dishes, including what the meats were on the charcuterie board (which I remembered them doing before). Our meal was over $250 for 4 people and I will never again go to Cure. There's way to many great restaurants in Pittsburgh where you can spend more than an hour and not feel rushed. Cure, you are too big for your britches and it's not a fun place to hang out and dine.",

    "text": "First off, if you are reading this review AND are interested in dining at Cure heed the next sentence. If you don't know what something is, ask the staff. There WILL be something you haven't heard of. Cure is a charcuterie and dining destination in this still backwards city. Sure, Pittsburgh is trundling forward but things are looking good.      Cure is definitely one of the good things. My lady and I arrived early in the evening and were privy to see all of the dishes that went out, prepared right before our eyes. All of the food has visual charm. If one were to simply eat with their eyes, and many people do, Cure would top the charts.       Flavor profiles were delicious as well, but an uneducated (or picky) diner may struggle with their food. Everything served is quite refined, flavors blending in harmony for those who chose to let them. My companion isn't a simpleton, or lacking social grace, but she admitted the entree had too much going on for her. Apparently the sauerkraut was touching everything. I thought the dish was a fantastic representation of a rustic countryside culinary delight.       The moral of this story; Know what you're ordering and eating, and if you don't like it - that doesn't mean it's everybody's opinion. My opinion is that Cure is delicious, and quite moderately priced too.",

    "text": "I feel like I'm being generous and stingy with my star allocation at the same time.  I've come to learn that I'm not a big fan of cured meats, so perhaps this is my shortcoming that I'm willing to transfer on to Cure's star rating.  So when ordering the Salumi plate, I tried all the cured meats, but wasn't particularly fond of any...as someone at our table said - \"It tastes like Spam\".  But I will say the prunes in honey or whatever heavenly sauce they drizzled over them was superb.  Next time I'd like to order a plate of prunes in heaven sauce a la carte.     Also the lardo stuff on the crostini wasn't my thing - it was too much...of what...you'll know what I'm talking about when you try it.  Lardo is apparently pig fat and butter mixed together to create a concoction of super guilt and mediocre taste.    That being said, I did enjoy their cheeses they offered under their \"Treats\" section.  They were all distinct in flavor and fresh.  The service was phenomenal as they took their time in explaining what everything was.  One suggestion - more crostini's on the plate please.  But when we asked for more they were more than generous in bringing us more.      As an entree I ordered the Walleye Pike which was served with brussel sprouts, bacon and had this mapley/beet juice sauce (not thick, but juice like).  The fish was prepared fantastically and the flavors were great, but it was a bit too citrusy for my mood.  I think I would have been better suited to order something savory from the menu.  But that's my poor judgment that I'll take full responsibility over.    We ordered the Chocolate Souffle Cake with pistachio butter.  The chocolate was on the dark side, more than I tend to like, but it worked b/c I couldn't stop myself from eating it.  And that's saying something coming from a milk chocolate kinda girl.  It was butter soft and melt in your mouth sorta good.  The pistachio butter (ground up pistachio's in some sort of oil) was a great compliment to the dish.      It's BYOB and the corkage fee is beyond reasonable - I think it was like $3!  Staff is friendly, food is unique and tasty - Cure is definitely a must try.",

Good music - but not too loud. Decor/lighting/ambiance all relaxing and inviting. Overall noise level all on the lower side, a nice thing if you actually enjoy having a conversation with your company.  Service - Quick. Attentive. Knowledgeable.   Food - Excellent. Scrumptious. Outstanding. Everything everyone has said about the quality, taste, and preparation of the food rang True. This based on the large salumi plate, black sea bass, duck confit, and gluttony dishes (a trifecta of duck breast, boudin, and pork belly confit).  So you might be wondering why only a 3 star rating with all of these glowing positives....  Well, I just think if you drop $150 on dinner (WITHOUT DRINKS), you shouldn't leave still hungry. It's just not a good value, regardless of how great the food is. Perhaps it's worth going to once a year or so for a special occasion, but it's certainly not a place you can frequent with any regularity. NYC prices in a Pittsburgh market.   The best analogy I can come up with is it's like Vegas - you have to go once for the experience and just to say you did, but after it's unlikely you'll return much - if ever.   There are just too many other options in the city with a comparable quality of food for substantially less....",

I even selected it as the place for my birthday dinner. :)   I placed my reservation far in advance knowing all of the hype this place has been receiving, so I was quite disappointed when I got there and found our table was right by the door (cold weather!) and crammed next to a few others. I was surprised a reserved table was not better prepared, I guess.   My friend and I both got the beet appetizer that was quite good, except for the fact that the vinegar overtook some of the bites. but overall was a good combo.   I got the duck as my main course and I have to say it was one of the best duck meals I've ever had. The other people in my party ordered the chicken and flank steak, but  I did not hear them go on and on about it. My bf asked to have a sauced removed from his plate of chicken, before ordering and he was told it wasn't possible. I find that annoying considering he wasn't asking for anything to be added, just taken away.   I'll end my review with a positive and negative. Minus, my friend called and asked if she could bring a bday cake for me and was told yes, and then they charged her $8 for it without warning. It's only $8 I know, but considering she called a warning would have been nice.   The plus, it's BYOB and has a very cute layout. I suppose I will go back again and give them one more chance, but it may be awhile.",

    "text": "Ugh...Cure, I really wanted/expected to love you.  Sadly, I'm left disappointed with a large hole in my wallet.   Based on the other reviews, Cure must have had a bad night when I went but when you pay a pretty penny for food (and when the restaurant displays such stigma) there should never ever be a bad night.  First things first...the good.  The atmosphere is fabulous. The smokey smell when you walk in sucks you in and makes your mouth water.  It's rustic meets chic with the open kitchen and bar, life seemed pretty good when we sat down.  Sadly, that was the best of our experience.  Service....if I could rate this solo, our waitress would get 1 lousy star. We all have bad nights, we've all had to deal with patrons being awful and rude.  I accept that but like I said above, a restaurant like Cure should never have a bad night (service included).  Our waitress never introduced herself, barely attempted to make sure we were satisfied, never smiled and was just a big dud.  When our food arrived, she checked back only once and we were already halfway through our meal.  Never took another drink order after the first. We had to ask another waitress for something to drink. To be fair to the restaurant, this seemed to be an isolated experience. Other wait staff seemed engaged and friendly with the other patrons. But it dragged the whole night down even further.   Menu...it's disappointingly limited.  That pretty much sums it up.  Not a lot to choose from and for a place whose uses a pig as their restaurant icon, I expected at least one pork dish but nada.  It is my understanding that the menu changes however so I guess if you go to Cure monthly, you would have variation...  Food....what should arguably be the absolute best part was seriously disappointing.  There were four of us dining and here is the breakdown...one had the steak. He rates the steak as \"very good, well seasoned\" but he didn't really like the fingerling potatoes (too hard).  The second had fish. By far the best at our table. It was very good but that's about all that was on the plate.  My hunny choose to have the huge smoked meet appetizer as his meal (salumi??) which was fine but not a good choice has a meal. His fault though.  The only complaint there was that while the server explained all of the meats on the plate, there were too many to remember so we had no idea what he was eating by the time she left!  Lastly, my meal...terrible.  I ordered the squid ink pasta with clams and garlic. I got a lump of black mush on a plate with chunks of unflavored breadcrumbs and pieces of clams.  It had no flavor and I didn't enjoy a single bite.  How can this so called \"excellent\" restaurant have a bad meal you ask?  I have no idea but it left a bitter taste in my mouth (literally).  If you go, I hope that your experience is better than ours but $200 later, dissatisfied, and a little shocked we left without any intention of returning or recommending Cure to our friends.   Peace!",

    "text": "My wife and I had dinner here tonight we left extremely disappointed.  Here's the description of my first course from the menu:  Beets - $11 smoked, pickled, custard, hay roasted black olive caramel, burnt pickled red onion, fennel seed brittle, carrot espuma, black garlic, grapefruit, feta  Do you know what you're going to taste from that description?  Exactly.  The dish was such an overdone mess of flavors that it's hard to know what you're really eating.  Of the three distinct beet preparations - smoked, pickled, hay roasted - the smoked were really good, the hay roasted were OK and the pickled were terrible.  On top of that, the other sauces and/or flavors were too many and too convoluted to make for an enjoyable dish.  This dish was $11. I would have been very happy to have paid $8-$10 for a plate of the smoked beets with ONE complimentary sauce/flavor. For dinner I had the duck confit.  Here's the menu description  Duck Confit - $27 pumpkin, red cabbage, orange, ginger, ras el hanout, black tea soaked prunes, maple- lavender mustard  Similarly to the first course, what am I going to taste in this dish?  The duck was fine.  The flavors of the underlying sauces were too much (in terms of numbers of flavors).  The mustard flavor was distinct from the other flavors but I could not tell you if it was maple-lavender mustard or simply mustard. Beyond the food, I found my seat at the bar to be frustrating.  First, they do not have backs on all of the seats at the bar. Second the \"seat\" of my stool was loose such that it wobbled around whenever I adjusted my weight.  Third, there was a constant draft at the bar such that I was cold the entire night despite wearing a long sleeve cotton shirt under a flannel shirt. Beyond the actual seat, when I went to the mens room I had to rummage through the cabinets to find paper towels. This experience struck me as a restaurant owned/run by a chef with some legit talent who needs a second voice or an editor.  For example, just because you can conceive of 7-9 flavors that might go well with beets, doesn't mean you should throw all of those flavors onto one plate.  Also, this second voice / editor could keep more of an eye on the front of the house - like the seats and state of the rest rooms.  I don't live in PGH, but I've been visiting 3-4 times a year for the past 12 years.  I'm really happy for PGH that its restaurant scene/culture is really taking off.  Unfortunately, I cannot consider Cure as part of this exciting wave.  Too many other good options exist - even in Cure's neighborhood - to waste one of my few nights out on this place.",

Champagne or a bottle of good scotch might not be a bad idea either. The menu is seasonal and isn't afraid to change completely.   That's right the menu is a living thing and does what it wants.   The chef is personable and involved. He brings food to the table and makes small talk. And also, he's really good at cooking things. If you don't like rich, fatty, delicious food, you should go somewhere else. If you want the best meal in Pittsburgh, there's a chance you'll find it here. If you find it somewhere else, call me.",

We tried: Salumi, Foie Blonde, Black Olive Focaccia,La Bella Farm Duck, Heritage Farm Chicken, Chamomile Pots de Creme, Dark Chocolate Souffle Cake.  The meats were so flavorful, juicy and tender.  The Foie Blonde was delicious.  The desserts were creamy and tasty.  The space is very cool and intimate.  Service was top notch.  One of the managers, Tim,was very personable and attended to our every need.  We were very impressed!",

    "text": "The huff and irritated sigh that I was greeted with when calling Cure an hour before my reservation sums up this place: Snooty and pretentious with no reason to be. I simply wanted to clarify their BYOB or full bar status, which did seem to be a legitimate question. The young lady on the other end of the phone clearly did not agree. \"Sir, we've had a fully stocked bar for months now\" she blurted at me in the snarkiest of snarky tones. Their idea of a fully stocked bar was three gins and three vodkas I'd never heard of before (and my name is not Clampett) and $12 for a gin-tonic. Plus a draft beer system that \"hasn't worked since we put it in.\" Full bar!! Food? Not even worth mentioning. The owner and staff clearly expect us to be impressed and fall at their feet for the mere fact that they breathe while I expect to be treated with -- oh maybe the slightest hint of -- human kindness and sincerity. Not here. And I'm sure not ever. I will continue to venture to upper Lawrenceville to dine at Pusadee's Garden (best thai food in the city and best outdoor dining space) across the street, and I will dance a little jig in Butler Street the day I see this place shuttered.",

After sharing the small Salumi plate (more than enough for two), I had the hanger steak and my wife had the duck confit.  Both were excellent and were prepared with many different elements (like something deconstructed) that you can experiment with to find your favorite combination of flavors.  The hanger steak was probably the best I've ever had.  I really enjoyed the little fluffy truffle parmesan churros, a very nice compliment to the meat.  The duck confit was just as delicious, especially the foie that came in the jar.  Luckily we left enough room for dessert because it was so delicious.  A wonderful meal.  Other than the food my other favorite part was bringing our own bottle of wine and only paying a small corkage fee.  I wish more restaurants did this (charging way less than $25 for a corkage fee).",

We ordered the beef cheeks and the foie gras dish and both were crazy delicious (boyfriend felt serving size was a little on the small side, I thought it was just right. He'll definitely order an app next time). We finished with fresh coffees and mini apple pies that were both the perfect ending. No complaints at all, only compliments to the chef and staff for such a great experience! Also, it's BYOB, so don't forget to grab a bottle to bring.",

Since the emphasis is on meat, most plates seemed heavy winter-ized with sauces, creams, starch etc. Little if any lighter fare. Tasty trout, outstanding beef cheeks beautifully cooked with great sauce, novel pork choucroute (wurst-free and cole-slaw like). Advice: Book a table for when they open their doors and order all the appetizers for dinner. If you like the experience, return for an entre another time.",

    "text": "Went with my wife on a Wednesday night.  Nice space, but pretty tight with the tables.  Our server was great. She explained the menu nicely, and she was courteous and professional with the BYOB wine service.  The menu is unique, for sure.  We ordered the tartare appetizer which had great flavors.  I still prefer a more traditional tasting steak tartare, but it was a great effort.  The portion was a bit small for sharing.  We also ordered the salad which was delicious.  It was really well done, but it didn't have any particular signature \"Cure\" influence about it.  The chicken egg, perhaps, was the unique item.  Again, we really enjoyed the taste.  My wife ordered the hangar steak.  Everything about the dish was great.  She really enjoyed the flavors.  I had the Pork (three ways), which was a bit of a mess.  The pork pieces themselves were well done, especially the belly confit.  The problem was all of the extra sauces and purees which created a messy presentation and made it difficult to eat.  I would not choose to order this dish again in this manner, though the belly confit was great.  I was wavering between 3-4 stars, but the BYOB pushed me over the edge.  It is a unique spot to go.  I wouldn't go with sky high expectations, but you should be treated to a nice, adventurous meal.  Almost forgot, we had the Dark Chocolate Souffle Cake.  My wife loved it, but that is right up her alley as she loves dark chocolate and peanut butter.",

I've been here for a little over a month but have already visited Cure twice, and not because it is within walking distance.  Here you can order anything off the menu no matter how startling it may sound and be assured that it will be delicious. For example, at my last visit, I had the duck heart with foie gras croquettes and duck leg confit. I twirled the small heart through the cherry custard and brioche puree accompanying and felt like an evil Disney Queen as I devoured it. yummers.  We also always order a bottle of  Pittsburgh Seltzer. Although it's just carbonated tap water it's fun to use the old-fashioned seltzer bottles and it adds an extra layer of fancy to our meal.  For both of visits our deserts contained pistachio butter sauce, which is 1 million times better than peanut butter and haunts my dreams nightly.",
