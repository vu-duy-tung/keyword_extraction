The vegetarian curry rolls were good as an appetizer, but hardly necessary as the amount of food in my dinner order was more than enough.  I had the stir fry vegetables with tofu over crispy noodles which was great.  The tofu was so good I had to take apart one of the pieces to make sure it really was tofu!     I've seen some negative comments about the service, but have no idea what that is about.  We had great service, and our order came in a perfectly reasonable amount of time.     My only complaint is that they're not open for lunch.  I work in the Southside and this would be at least a once-a-week stop for me if it was an option.",

    "text": "To understand Cambod-Ican Kitchen, you must understand it's proprietor Dan. Dan is the sometimes loud but always friendly owner of Cambod-Ican and he and nearly every member of his family have been filling the bellies of the later night Carson Street revelers since before Diesel was called Nick's Fat City.   Dan has his own roofing business, manages several properties, and yet still would spend all of his evenings and most of the early mornings on weekends outside, in the weather, gladly bantering with drunks, handing out kabobs and wontons with smiles and jokes. The hours must have been hell, but the lines were always long as he would hold court on the end of the \"meat wagon\" style set up until 3 AM every Thursday night through Sunday morning.   It's safe to say that Dan was years ahead of the food cart culture that has developed on the coasts in recent years.  When Nakama opened several years later and, although the Cambodican Wagon was considered a Southside institution, the powers that be forced Dan to close up shop because they didn't want someone underselling them outside their door. But after over a dozen years of working with the freakiest flakes on southside, Dan's dealt with stranger setbacks than \"the man\".   That's when he opened the full service restaurant at 1701 Carson. It features a bigger staff, indoor seating, a much deeper menu and still has all of the classics old school southsiders and slopies would stand outside for an hour to get.  My late night staple has always been the chicken on pita, no veggies with at least 6 friend seafood wontons and moon sauce on everything - (seriously, moon sauce is the best thing since the internet). The only drawback to CK is that the crowd swells with the traffic on Carson so there are times when there's no way for the staff to handle the demand. If you come in at the wrong time, you can end up waiting a very long time in somewhat-to-extremely-rowdy crowd.  Other than that, the Cambod-Ican is a delicious, inexpensive, unique place that's a must visit when I have friends in town visiting Carson Street.",

Like some of the other reviewers, I was amused but altogether put off by their excessive signage in and around the restaurant. If paper products are that expensive, then cut down on the cheap signs and buy a chalkboard. Bazinga.   At any rate, I went with a large group of friends and we all ordered different things. I ordered the noodle soup and an order of spring rolls. Although we all ordered at once, my order came out (and I am not exaggerating in the slightest), twenty minutes AFTER everyone else's. When my spring rolls finally did arrive, they were terrible! No shrimp, just lettuce and a tiny bit of cilantro in rice paper. I tried to complain, and I was sneered at.  At least they didn't deliver their jeers in sign form.   I won't be returning.",

I decided to go on a Sunday with my girlfriend, and we had chosen at random a place we haven't gone to before in South Side. I most definitely do NOT regret this choice. The manager was very enthusiastic, kind, and had a great sense of humor. The staff clearly knows they're stuff, as the food was delicious and in generous portions. Each of our meals were $10.95, which is definitely a fair price. The food was well prepared, in a timely manner, and was delectable. I got the cashew chicken, where as my girlfriend got the General Tso's chicken. Both came with two medium-large sized portions of your choice of brown or white rice. I highly recommend both dishes. The only downside to this restaurant was the dining area itself. I noticed that a lot of the silverware had a few spots on them here and there, as well as the glass windows being rather streaky. But, I asked for a new set and everything was in order. If you frequent South Side and are looking for a great place to eat, Cambodican Kitchen is a must try.",

I highly suggest their seafood wontons with their special moon sauce to dip in on the side. You will not regret it!!!

I also don't like the handwritten signs that made excuses for why their service is slow and why they don't let non-patrons use their bathroom (a simple \"customers only\" would work, but no, they have to go into great lengths to explain that toilet paper is expensive and therefore only their \"friends\" -- the customers -- can use the toilets blah blah).  That aside, decor (minus the handwritten signs) is great.  I felt like I was at a noodle stand in southeast Asia.  I enjoyed my Cambod-Ican noodle soup (their take on pho).  I normally don't like pho because it tastes too much like MSG but it wasn't so bad here.  I tasted my friend's crispy noodles and thought it tasted like really sweet, low quality Chinese take out lo-mein (but at least the noodles were sufficiently crispy).  My other friend found her vegetable curry with chicken to be too spicy for her liking.  The whole payment system is awkward.  Why not just take payment when I order at the window?  Why do I have to awkwardly and deliberately put on my coat in full view of the window to signal them to come out and give me the check?  It's beyond me.",

We were in town for Bears Steelers and ended up looking for action on this side of town after downtown deflated due to Bears crushing victory. Whether due to the game or earlier revelry for the Pirates clinching the playoffs, Carson was pretty low key so we decided to end the night eating rather than drinking.  The food was good and the owner definitely took pride in the preparation a la Muhammad Ali. He actually told me it'd be the best soup broth I'd ever had, which made me wonder whether people I cook for feel the same way when I tout my own abilities. In short it wasn't the best but it was good. I felt bad not finishing it because he was so damn excited about it but i dug the commitment and self promotion. Having been to southeast Asia and living in a city with many southeast Asian options I was surprised I was as satisfied as I was. The wontons were also good but I'd stick with Vietnamese/Cambodian options based on our sample.  Pretty sure this place has the biggest bathroom door 'do not steal me' key chain I've ever seen. Really wish I would have explored that with the owner. I can only imagine what fri/sat late night madness led to that security measure. Maybe drunks were stealing some of that expensive toilet paper referenced in their signage?",

I am extremely grateful for it and am deeply sorry that it took me close to 3 years to actually get to this spot.  Simple and effective are 2 words that can accurately describe it.  Its open late and serves food that caters to that demographic.. (Drunks)  But don't get me wrong, theres good food here for the normal everyday people as well.  The dumplings with moon sauce are way out of this world and if you only could eat here once, I would put them at the top of the list.",

    "text": "I absolutely love this place. I am one of those people--much-discussed in other reviews--who crowds into Cambod-Ican on Friday or Saturday after a night of imbibing on the South Side looking for a surf and turf (extra surf, no turf) to satisfy my alcohol-induced hunger. The surf and turf is a magical wrap-like concoction that is filled with a beef kabob and a few crab rangoons, drizzled with the mystical \"moon sauce.\" I have actually never had anything else from this place, and I probably never will. The crab rangoons are hands down the best I have ever had, even before the moon sauce comes on the scene. They have an onion-like flavor in the dough itself and are the perfect balance of salty and sweet. I don't eat beef, but by request you can have the \"surf and turf\" with a vegetable kabob instead. It's usually the same price, so if you ask nicely, they might add an extra rangoon or two for free.  On weekends the Cambod-Ican has an outdoor stand where they sell exclusively surf and turfs, but you can still go inside and order from the full menu. They are open late, so you can leave the bar at 2am and still enjoy this magical meal. As far as I know, the whole place is cash-only, but there is an ATM inside. Have I mentioned how affordable this delicious food is? It's absolutely worth the price and then some. I never leave without tipping because I feel like I'm robbing the place. Whether you are sober, drunk, or hungover, you will not find a more comforting fried-food concoction on the south side. Writing this review has me itching to go back. Excuse me...",

    "text": "Note: You know this one...lemme year yinz...CASH ONLY!  Ohhhh, authentic, pshawthentic,...who really gives a turd?   When chunks of skewered chicken are so fragile, flavor-blessed, and cozily smoldering on the tongue you devour them quickly only to weep because they're in your intestines, does it matter?   When sugar and salt romance each other, resulting in the cabalistic, Delphian, rayless Moon Sauce, and said chicken is baptized in it, is its national origin that relevant?  So yes, in case you're curious, I did enjoy my pre-concert (In This Moment at ye old Rex Theater) dinner on Good Friday, for the most part at least.   I mean, those seafood dumplings tasted like Crab Rangoon made by Sandra Lee. \"Semi-homemade\" no doubt. In all seriousness, my palate held a processed aftertaste from them, one that was unwelcomingly saccharine and padded with *ahem* mysterious sea creatures that most likely were not crustaceans.   Looking at the upside, I did find my whole-wheat (?) pita to be an acceptable change-up from the usual, white flour kind.   And is the Tumbleweed Pie ever a sly, coy exercise in dessert cool. Served chilled, the pie itself is French Vanilla and coffee ice cream mashed together within a graham cracker crust and topped with whipped cream and a maraschino cherry.  No kiddin' they wouldn't serve this in Thailand, ya snark!   But they should for it is a light treat ideal for ending spicy meals, its creaminess taking away the sweet, warm pain that is occasionally needed to let you know you're alive.   Please don't be put off by the type of mod interiors and exteriors that might make diners wonder if the owners are lampooning the 70's or truly think \"Three's Company\" was engrossing, brilliant television deserving of a shrine. When you use the john, take what's written on the \"board\" and tablet of rules, throw it all over your shoulder (but not the key! it's attached to a heavy pole so people won't walk off with it!) along with any biases you may have, and realize that whoever's heading Cambod-Ican kitchen is a smart-ass that just happens to be adept at preparing cheap, satisfying, semi-exotic grub that could vaguely be described as Asian.  P.S. Cambod-Ican Kitchen is open from 6PM to 5AM from Tuesday through Saturday! They'll leave a light on for ya without judgement!",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Thursday evening with my wife for dinner.  We have had take-out food from here before and had driven and walked by it numerous times without stopping before.  So whenever we entered the place we were sort of shocked by how it looked.  It felt clean but also had that run down look to it.  In addition to that my wife and I were amused by the handwritten pages in all of the menus.  This is also the type of place where you order first and then sit down. As we were about to order I noticed the cash only sign.  So while they have an ATM in the restaurant I made my way down the street to my bank.  Whenever we got back my wife and I both placed our orders.  I ended up going with the beef curry while my wife went with the beef noodle bowl.  We also went with two bottles of water since it didn't seem like we would have anything to drink otherwise although I didn't ask.  After we were seated for about 5 minutes the cashier came out to us and let us know that they were out of beef.  I found that odd seeing how that was one of the 4 main ingredients on their menu.  Instead both my wife and I ended up going with chicken.  A short amount of time later our food was delivered to our table.  My curry ended up being rather good and I loved the developed flavors of the sauce.  What I didn't enjoy was the overcooked to being mushy broccoli and also that some of the chicken was so grisly that I couldn't chew it and had to spit it out.  My wife really enjoyed her soup even though I wasn't the biggest fan of the broth myself.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  While the restaurant itself feels somewhat rundown and the clientele inside felt trashy, I did enjoy most of the food that I had.",

I have nothing against cowboys but you definitely see a little culture clash with an Asian restaurant when the guy is speaking with western accent saying yeehaw!   Anyway the guy was very enthusiastic about Cambodian food, so much that I asked for his recommendation, due to the fact I was new to the food, and so... I ordered his favorite dish- a soup. It was nothing special like a sour version of viatnamese pho while costing around 18 bucks.  The venue was for the most part clean and appeared presentable and pleasing.  Overall the food was similar to chinese and was about 7-8 dollars more... Even my friends dishes tasted like a chinese with a twist.  I wasn't really impressed, while I understand that Cambodia is proximal to China I was expecting for it to have some distinct flavor of its own, and if it was just like chinese for it to be similarly priced, it wasn't fancy or anything.   I enjoy a wide array of asian foods. Cambodian- especially this location did not impress me much. I would try it again, but it wouldn't be my first choice.",

Was this place good because most people may not be completely sober, or was it actually attractive regardless of intoxication level? Now I'm pretty sure it's the latter, in particular with regard to their delicious beef stew. Quite different from a lot of other noodle soup based dishes in that the broth base is curry, so overall it's rather sweet and a bit spicy. But the beef and other ingredients still make it savory at the same time, so every bite is just full of flavor. In addition to the beef, of which there was a lot, there was also a decent amount of carrots, potatoes, cilantro, and basil, with the herbs adding in the freshness factor. The noodles were nothing fancy but they were cooked nice and soft, so they rounded out the whole meal. I don't know about any of the other more fusion-sounding dishes, but this one was in a class of its own.",

    "text": "Let's be honest, you think any restaurant with Asians, Koreans, Cambodians, Chinese and Japanese sells general tso's and fried rice, luckily for you this place does, and so much more.  On Friday and Saturday nights this place is overflowing with intoxicated but friendly people looking to get the surf and turf on pita with Crab Wontons and the famous Moon Sauce ( a syrupy sweet teriyaki).  The real time this place shines is inside, off the menu, late night, during the week for a surprisingly classy full service meal.  Cambodican kitchen stays open till 4AM during the week!    Order the noodle soup, any chicken dish and why not, get the crab wontons.  Order what you want and while you wait, make sure to make a trip to the bathroom.  Really READ the poem.  Take from it your own interpretation and apply it how you see fit.  Sit in this place, take someone, take 5 people and just hang and take the food in slow.  The place is owned and operated by the whole family each with their own unique flair as a person.  They will accommodate you with whatever you need including necessary garnish if requested.  The quality of service is always top notch.  Have your business meeting at Nakama, Take your friends to Cambodican Kitchen.  Tell them HITTofMCM sent ya!",

I was surprised they still had their full menu going. We ordered fresh spring rolls and 2 bowls of pho. For the mayhem that was going on in there of people running jn and out and stumbling everywhere, I was surprised we were able to actually have a sit down meal.   They were damn efficient for the crowd and super pleasant and made everyone laugh. So service was awesome. On top of that, I expected to just grab our food from the window, but he ran all of our food out to us. And when it got to us - so delicious! Spot on flavor and it didn't taste like it was rushed in any way!  We will def be heading back there. Maybe try them out during the week too when it's probably a little calmer. Def recommend going on a weekend night if you happen to be in Southside.",

Cambodican's staff makes you feel as though you are part of their extended family by welcoming each and every patron with open arms, imbued with inevitable quirkiness (i.e. the bathroom key, eloquent food descriptions, and humble dispositions).   As many have stated before, their seafood wonton, invariably coated in moon sauce, is a must have starter. These savory pockets of joy melt in the mouth of those in drunken stupors and sober friends alike.   For the main course I recommend the authentic noodle soups, along the lines of Vietnamese Pho, but with a sweet herbiness that is unmatched elsewhere.  To summarize, Cambodican has been and always will be a Pittsburgh favorite. It's all the joys of a no-frills home cooked meal, while exploring the flavors of South East Asia. Stop in if you ever have the chance.",

Most nights you can see their owner on the street making a scene and enjoying the South Side insanity, it's basically open 24 hours a day, it caters to a vastly inebriated clientele, the decor is outdated and a little dingy, etc. So needless to say, I was very surprised when I yelped this place to find that it has such high ratings. However, when you really strip Cambod-Ican down to its core, it's legitimately great, authentic food, at a reasonable price! That being said, I would not consider the food to be 5 stars, it's definitely closer to 4, but in a city with very few late night dining options, the fact that they are open until 5am, for me pushes them to at least a 4.5 star rating. Feel free to disagree, but I know I'm right, and you probably smell funny.",

    "text": "Cambod-Ican Kitchen is the spot if you're looking for lots of cheap food, served at all hours of the night. However, if you prefer a restaurant where the tables aren't sticky to the touch, an owner who wears a clean shirt, or where you don't need a key for the bathroom, this isn't your spot.  I can appreciate a quality dive joint. There's a certain charm to an establishment that has great food and a lot of character (stemming from the food, the decor, or the staff). Cambod-Ican Kitchen is certainly a dive, but it doesn't really have the character I'm looking for now that I'm in my mid-thirties. When my girlfriend and I entered, we were greeted at the counter by the burly owner handing us menus and barking \"Read\" to each of us. I kind of figured that he was going for funny with this greeting, but he was gruff enough that it took some further interaction with him to confirm that he was just being a goofball.   After ordering, and sitting down at the table in the front of the restaurant where the owner recommended, we were surprised at how sticky the table (and everything else on it) was. The owner also proudly told us about the dried roasted red pepper topping that all tables had, which I found to be very tasty. The little jar they were in was very sticky- I tried not to think about how long it had been since it was probably cleaned.  We were pretty hungry, and ordered the appetizer sampler, as well as chicken thigh fried rice, and pork noodle soup. The appetizer sampler platter was huge, just a mountain of fried food. The egg rolls were average, and the grilled chicken was decent, although a bit on the dry side. A lot of the items on the platter were covered in their signature \"moon sauce,\" which was way too sweet for my taste, but if sweet sauces are your thing, you'll probably love it.  The chicken thigh fried rice was solid as fried rices go, but not good enough for me to venture back. The pork noodle soup didn't have much flavor to it, and the noodles were very much overcooked.   Cambod-Ican Kitchen is an interesting cash-only place, that's open all night long, run by an irreverent, off-kilter owner. I enjoyed and admired his passion, but wasn't into his brand of humor (his diatribes were quite frequent when we were there). I suppose that working at a restaurant at odd hours of the night for years and dealing with drunk patrons can do that, though.  If you're looking for food that is authentic, healthy, or really tasty, I would keep looking. However, if you want a huge quantity of food that's ok, really sweet, cheap, and don't mind an owner who could be a wacky sitcom character, you have your spot.",

    "text": "\"It's okay to let out orgasmic moans here [because the food is so good of course]. Just so you ladies know, from a guy's point of view, we guys love that.\"  ---Words of wisdom from the spunky waiter at Cambod-Ican (I wish I asked him for his name).   This place has such a \"fun\" and laid-back feel to it. They really try to make you feel at home here. My friends and I were unsure of what to get so waiter was nice enough to give us a breakdown of the menu and we each ended up ordering one of the recommended items. I noticed that a lot of the customers are regulars because the waiter knows them by name.   The wait was a good 15 minute, but I know for sure they made our food fresh right after we ordered them, instead of the precooked stuff most Asian restaurants are guilty of. For appetizers, we had their signature \"fried seafood wontons\", which was just another name for Crab Rangoons. I love crab rangoons so I really liked these...crispy with the right amount of cream cheese, not overly sweet. I ordered a \"shish kabob platter\", which came with grilled chicken, grilled kielbasa and rice drizzled with their signature \"moon sauce\". Ladies and gents...moon sauce is just a fancy name for teriyaki sauce. I thought the rice was a little bit too dry though.   My one friend ordered Cambodian chicken noodle soup. The menu compared this noodle soup to Vietnamese Pho. I am Vietnamese, and trust me...I KNOW pho. This Cambodian chicken noodle soup was pretty decent, but no way can this be compared to Pho (the King of all noodle soups). One friend ordered the \"sampler platter\", which has a bunch of fried stuff and their grilled chicken, and the other friend ordered the \"chicken curried vegetable bowl\" with lo mein, instead of rice. That was pretty spicy, but it was probably my favorite out of all the entrees.   So if I rate this restaurant solely on its food quality, then it would only deserve 3 stars because I thought the food was pretty average...nothing deserving of \"oohhhs\", \"ahhhhs\", or \"wow\". In other words, the food did not give me a \"foodgasm\". But, it was such a positive experience overall because the atmosphere and the wonderful service so they deserve 4 stars. Our waiter was the most enthusiastic and energetic man I've ever met. He was cracking jokes left and right, and engaging all of the customers in conversations. The food was okay, but I would definitely recommend you give Cambod-Ican a try just to meet this dynamic character.",

A shish-ka-bob platter comes with three boneless and skinless chicken thighs over a large bed of rice. Two of these with the wontons feeds my family of four.  The restaurant itself is a bit of a dive that may not appeal to someone who prefers a more sanitary dining experience so to speak.",

Besides the shady atmosphere and street. The owner and workers were all awesome. Had the seafood wontons and beef stew. Yea it was great and flavorful. Would like to try other things here because j was impressed and it's open super late. Win win. Had the red bean mochi with whip cream on top and that was great as well.

The atmosphere and the clientele are eclectic and our dining experience was enjoyable for those reasons.  That being said, I unfortunately have to be one of the few who did not enjoy the food as much. We ordered the Cambodian beef stew and the seafood wontons. The wontons were great at first bite, but progressively became a little too salty to stomach. The Cambodian beef stew was packed with flavor but also saccharine sweet to the point that I could not finish it - just seemed like a little too much was going on. I'm not sure if this food just didn't fit my palate, but my boyfriend tried it as well and agreed, and he ususally tolerates most sugars/spices. I guess I would try it for yourself if you're feeling adventurous and have a good tolerance for salt and sugar since there seem to be a good number of people who do enjoy it.",

We both ordered the Cambodian noodle soup--he got beef and I got tofu with veggie broth, and it came with a big plate of bean sprouts, basil, and cilantro.  Very pho-esque.  We enjoyed our soup, and the waiter was fantastic.  I told him I enjoy spicy food, so he brought out two kinds of sriracha, pickled Thai peppers, and some hot sauce from his own personal stash for me to try.  I would definitely go back just because the people here are so nice--but it's a bonus that the food is great too!",

The dish consisted of 3 large pieces of grilled to perfection tender chicken pieces over soft rice. I requested some stir fry vegetables and the chef  did that for only $1 more. My hubby ordered the crispy pan fried noodles with beef and it looked and tasted amazing. Portions were big and we both brought home a box.  Service was especially warm, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The venue is kind of jenk though and so is the unwieldy bathroom stick. I did not use facilities but I imagine them to be kind of gross just based on the greasy, dim-lit surroundings. If i lived closer to the area, I would be by here all the time for a quick bite. Did I mention the moon sauce? That was also da bomb.   I do take 1 star off because of the cash only policy. Handling dirty bills and coins is just a hassle and especially next to your food... But that's it. I would definitely come back for the food.",

Located on E Carson St, the nightlife mecca of Western PA, and the street with the prettiest and bareliest-dressed boys... I mean girls... perhaps anywhere outside Florida and California. And I think the food is actually really good.  I have heard from a number of people that this place really sucks. I'm not Cambodian so I don't know what it's supposed to taste like over in Phnom Penh, but I have to say that I found the food to be really good. It's a little pricy but then what else is available at 1 in the morning?   There's a reason why there's such a long line here. There's a couple of good Gyros around here (cough Mike & Tony's cough), but if you don't feel like a Gyro, then why not come and try some of this excellent curry-ish deliciousness.   The really funny thing about this place is the bathroom. You need a key for it which they will gladly give you - but it's attached to what basically is a lamp post. So you have to drag the lamp-post with you to the bathroom... it's hilarious.  So why do people diss it? Not sure what the problem is really.  I know what my problem is though.  I'm attracted to cooking pots.  I mean, I'm Pansexual.",

Luckily, we stumbled across this gem. Since it was late, we had to order at the window, but the employee was so friendly and funny that he left a good indication on how their overall service was.   We ended up getting the crab fried rice and the Cambod-Ican beef stew. As an Asian, I was skeptical of the fried rice, but boy am I glad we got it. They used real crab, not imitation crab, and the taste of crab even carried into the rice itself. Mm. As for the beef stew, the first bite was heaven and it wasn't just because I was starving and had a slight amount of liver poison in my system.   Just a warning though, it's rather rowdy and we had a few people approach us. Slightly uncomfortable, but expected since it is late night South Side.    Overall, good prices and spot on food. 20/10 would go back... but probably during daytime hours.",

Dishes are all on the sweet side so after a short while of eating they all start tasting the same. Great value and prices.  Now... I will recount my honest experience with service. 5/5 for the female waitress who was sweet, patient, and nice. 0/5 for the older slightly large male waiter. First of all, I'm a young female who does not like to be touched by strangers. When he poked my rib cage to get my attention and later rubbed my arm I was alarmed. However, when he wrapped his arms around my friend's shoulders, I was very alarmed as she froze in extreme discomfort.  So I told him, excuse me but we feel really uncomfortable when you touch us and would prefer not to be touched. Instead of a simple apology, he laughed. In our faces. Us 7 girls were taken aback. Second of all, we love our white rice and we don't care if it's 'bad' for us or has 'no nutritional value'. However, when he brought out our food and saw we ordered white rice he pointed at it and said, \"this stuff is empty carbs with absolutely no nutrition. It is yucky and I never eat it.\" Sorry we love white rice. Third of all, since we were all stuffed and feeling lethargic from the sugar crash by the end of the meal, we couldn't finish our soup. He goes, \"look at all this food your wasting. I will not judge you for picking up that bowl and holding your face to it and dumping it in your mouth because it's soo tasty.\" Sigh.",

    "text": "After a fairly perfect introduction to Pittsburgh nightlife, the Surf and Turf pita at Cambod-ican was a proverbial coup de gras.   The pita is a torpedo of protein (grilled chicken thigh and elongated crab wonton loaded into a thin pita.)  Is it Cambodian? Probably not. Is it delicious? Yes.  The chicken shines in this sandwich. Well marinated, smoky, soft yet firm on the bite. Carefully monitored for internal temperature. Its respectfully finished with a sweet teriyaki demi-glaze that will leave your hands a bit sticky.  The crab wontons are as good as those can get. They are a conglomerate of imitation crab, breaded filling, and hot cream cheese deep fried in a dense corn meal batter. The bite experience is beautiful. The robust batter crust holds firm until it doesn't. You're left defending your palate against a cascade of creamy, crab flavored bliss. But this is a white flag you'll be happy to wave.  The pita was thin, but disappointingly chalky. It did not absorb the greasiness of its contents well. It did not hold them well. It distracted from the quality of the sandwich overall.  Replace the underperforming pita with something softer and more absorbent, yet thin, and this would be a five star experience. Cambod-ican is undoubtedly a great choice if you're within a couple miles and want excellent Asian American street food, particularly late in the evenings.",

Years later, I find myself craving Cambod-Ican Kitchen. Drinking, dancing, stumbling, late-night, I'm hungry. I'm in the South Side. Burger King is closed. Seafood wontons.  In graduate school, I find myself seeking out Cambod-Ican Kitchen. Studying, relaxing, tired, late-night, I'm hungry. I'm in the South Side. Seafood wontons.  As a professional, I find myself going out of my way to fit Cambod-Ican Kitchen into my life. Friends in town? Seafood wontons. Need to get out of the house? Seafood wontons. Just ate some seafood wontons? Seafood wontons.  Everything on the menu is good, sure, but...man, those seafood wontons.",

Its got kind of a strange set up to allow for late night grubbing for the bar hoppers - but slightly confusing for those who are just coming for dinner.  We ordered at the window and the food was brought to our table, but I have a feeling I wouldn't have gotten my tea until dinner if I wouldn't have asked for it.  The food was good, but nothing really remarkable, and their 'moon' sauce is tasty and sweet, but it was really on everything, and overpowered any other flavors.  The food was relatively cheap, and the drinks were actually pretty expensive ($2.50 for a small pot of tea, no refills).  I also had to stand at the kitchen window for a couple minutes to get change to pay, but not one of the 3 people in the kitchen bothered to get someone to help me.  I eventually just gave up and got some change together myself.  The atmosphere was actually pretty decent and I was mildly surprised since I anticipated something more along the lines of the 'truck food' roots that it came from.   I would eat here again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get there.  I also would try something else in hopes of something a little tastier and with a bit more depth.   Maybe",

The food takes a while to come out, but face it - you're drunk anyway - and if you're lucky you'll get to witness the same family bickering we did that I'm sure will result in hefty psychiatrist bills later in life for their kids.  Honestly, the food served here is exactly what hits the spot if you've had a few drinks and need something in your stomach to forestall an impending hangover.  This means, in case you can't read between the lines, that it's a bit on the heavy and greasy side, which is exactly what you need sometimes.",

The restaurant is family owned and operated, with mother and son in the kitchen, and father and daughter in the front. Sometimes they have extra help, but it is usually pretty slow. And very casual, with a decor that reflects this. It's also BYOB.   The only drawback is trying to find a parking space near this section of Carson Street.",

I wasn't expected the signature fragrant broth of pho but I was expecting noodles, any good flavor, and lots of toppings to throw in.  I was disappointed in my very plain soup that was incredibly sweet I squeezed it out every time I ate my noodles. The meat was very tender which was nice, but the toppings (basil, cilantro and beansprouts) were not enough to absorb the broth. It was basically a very sweet beef broth without a particularly memorable flavor.   I also was not happy paying double the price of pho to reserve half the portion of the cambodican noodle soup.  A newbie mistake I made was buying bottled water bc you order at a pick-up-like and didn't know they would bring glasses of water to our table. This added to my bill and went against my usual stance of not buying bottled water (but I was really thirsty).  Wish I could have better things to say since the people were so nice and I loved the orange chopsticks and napkins they had.",

    "text": "I made my first visit to Cambod-ican last night before taking in a show across the street at the Rex.   The first thing I noticed when I walked in were the reviews and newspaper features posted on the wall. Apparently this place started off as a humble food truck a few years ago before upgrading to a full restaurant, and it's a bit of a go-to spot on the South Side. I don't spend a whole lot of time on this end of the city, so it's taken me a while to make it down to eat here, but now that I have, I'll definitely be coming again.  I had the kuyteav soup bowl, which is very similar (though not identical) to the pho you can get at Tram's, Pho Minh or Vietnam's Pho elsewhere in the city. The broth was delicious, with bits of fried garlic floating at the top. It came with a plate of fixings (bean sprouts and cilantro, though no basil this time, as I believe they were out of it for the night), and a container of roasted chile flakes on the table added the perfect amount of heat.   The people I came with had the steamed rice noodles and General Tso's with brown rice, and everybody at the table was pleased with their meal. I snagged bites here and there, loving everything, and I'm going to have to come back to this place again and again to order everything else that looks good on the menu.   Cambod-ican makes everything to order, meaning for a lot of things there's a bit of a wait between paying and receiving the meal, so if you're starving you might want to stick to the listed \"quick\" foods on the wall or perhaps start off with an appetizer.   If you're on the South Side and low on cash, or just want a tasty Asian-style meal, this is the place to go. The portions are huge, the prices low and the food is excellent, especially the soup.",

The shrimp rolls were good, but since they aren't comprised of anything but shrimp and rice paper, I'm not going to applaud them too much for those. I would like to note that this all occurred at around 1:00 AM, so my expectations weren't even that high.  Everyone who has given this place good reviews - I have to speculate when they ate this food, they were either black-out drunk or had a severe case of the munchies, or have never had decent (much less good) Asian noodle soup or noodle dishes.",
