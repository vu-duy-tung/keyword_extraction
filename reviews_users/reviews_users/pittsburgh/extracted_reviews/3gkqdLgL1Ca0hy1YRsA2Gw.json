(I suggested it since I've had really great experiences at their downtown location). There were three people working and about 6 people in front of us. They burnt almost everyone's pizza.  The pizza is cooked on a conveyor belt and they left trays on there so everyone's pizza got stuck in the machine. After discovering the first 2 pizzas were burnt they proceeded to leave those ones on the belt while remaking them, which then in turn caused our pizzas to be stuck in the machine and get burnt.  My pizza wasn't so burnt so they didn't remake it but my boyfriend's was destroyed. Out of anger he just took it because he was hungry and didn't want to wait. Since mine was stuck in there for longer than it should've it was a bit hard to eat and his was nearly inedible.  The one shining grace was the obviously new employee felt so bad she remade my boyfriend's pizza and brought it over to us as an apology (I give this girl a lot of credit, especially since the shift manager should've done something).  They were incredibly disorganized and uncommunicative with each other. Would hate to see it when it's actually busy.",

    "text": "I'd really like to give this place 4 or 5 stars for the pizza, and a 1 for service.  I've had nothing but terrible experiences at this location which is a damn shame for Upper Lawrenceville.  The fact that I keep going back should tell you how much I enjoy the pizza.   Issues I've had with staff include but are not limited to:   1) Randomly closing the doors on us AT LUNCHTIME and not letting us in when we could see that there were customers inside (this has happened to me TWICE)   2) Aloof and rude employees not acknowledging when I'm standing at the counter and they're too busy chatting.   3) Downright lying about the ingredients in the sauce because they were too lazy to fix their mistake and remake the pizza that they messed up. (they put pesto sauce on my pizza when I asked for white garlic. My significant other called them out on  this, informing them that I have a nut allergy and pesto will kill me. They still wouldn't admit their wrongdoing or remake the pizza)  4) Just today, an employee skipped over my sister and I in line and rolled his eyes at us because we wanted salads (which were small and terrible by the way).  He angrily shouted \"okay who here is gettin' a pizza?!\" without addressing us further than the initial eye roll. He then filled the next customer's order and proceeded to take 5 minutes to shuffle around and slowly pull out salad bowls, which were not hidden, but in plain sight.  Even though we ordered standard salads off the menu, he made us tell him what to put on these salads, and rolled his eyes even more when we told him to add garlic, because that meant he had to pull out a knife and cutting board.   Long story short, there's a reason that this location is rated 3 stars versus the downtown location which is currently rated at 4 stars.  If you're in Lawrenceville and you want a delicious, quick, cheap pizza, be prepared to deal with dishonest, angry, aloof employees (there are a few good employees, but they're far outnumbered).  Oh, and don't bother with a salad.  EDIT: CHANGED MY REVIEW TO 4 STARS FROM 3 BECAUSE THE SERVICE HAS IMPROVED.",

It's addition to the neighborhood hasn't been fantastic and it's quickly built a reputation for itself due to negative employee behavior and erratic hours.    For example, on multiple occasions, I've gone in to get the family their individual pizzas for dinner. Staff closed early. There is no rhyme or reason to when this place is open. They just lock the doors before the closing time and clean up. No note posted, no reason. It's ridiculous.  Another time I attempted to enter and they told me they were closing and to leave.   The other issue is consistency. There is none.  There is the potential for a great product but this location is all over the place. Sometimes they serve my kid a pile of mushy bread. Other times the crust is burnt and hard with toasted toppings.  I don't understand how something that is a chain and that should run smoothly is falling apart so quickly.    What I do know is this- despite having liked the convenience and concept of this location, I'm tired of wasting my time & money going here. I won't be returning.",

    "text": "Just to let everyone know I had this idea quite a while ago to have a pizza place with unlimited toppings for one good price.  I did not copyright that idea unfortunately.  Blaze pizza does that same thing, but the one that I went to had all this ash on the bottom of it from the oven.  The pizza here is pretty much pristine and there are tons of toppings to choose from, or you can use one of their many house specials.  Not only that, but you have additional uncooked toppings that you may add to the pizza after it is a finished product.  There is lots of tablespace to chill out on and a nice veiw of the street from the dinning area.  There are also tons of beverage options including bottles coffees, sodas, sparkling waters and fountain drinks.  Yah, this place is pretty much an awesome choice at anytime.  I like this place because in order to get a good deal at most pizza places you have to order for a group of people and have everyone chip in.  With this place you can get pizza alone, or with a group and it is still a pretty good deal.  All the toppings are worth it as well and really being able to customize it is a thing of beauty.  The service was also excellent, yeee haw!",

    "text": "Just picked up takeout from V3. I ordered the Barbeque and my wife had pepperoni with cheese. This was the best flat bread pizza we've had in Lawrenceville over the last two months!   The crust was perfect and the toppings were tasty! This is a chain that offers several types of dough, including gluten free. We had the regular flatbread crust. All pizzas are $8. Gluten free is a couple dollars more.   After reading some of the poor reviews we were hesitant to try it out but we were pleasantly surprised.   The store was empty at 8pm and I think the two people working were owners or managers. The area behind the counter was a bit messy and there were only about 4 different bottled drinks to select from the cooler. They did have a decent selection of soda fountain drinks.   We will definitely go back. It's hard to beat excellent quality at less than $20 for two people. FYI - We didn't order drinks because it was takeout.    Expect an update to the review if there is an issue with consistency as noted by other posts.",

I chose the cattle ranch pizza, it came with steak, ranch, and mushrooms. The dough was soft and the crust was very lightly crunchy. Definitely better than might be expected from what looks like prepackaged dough.  They also have a wide array of shakers and oils (about 5 shakers and 4 oils) by the soda.  This place is kind of like if subway made fancy pizzas (in a great way). As for the price point, Im going to stop going to little Caesars, because for a couple bucks more you get a wayyy better pie here.",

We ordered a make your own pizza and walked up the street to pick it kral other customers came and left with their orders when finally I got up to ask where ours was.  He grabbed a box off the rack and said \"oh, sorry.  Didn't know you were here\". No apology for the wait or the screw up  or any offer of a discount or dessert.  As an added bonus to this sad experience 2 other employees showed up from somewhere and started working.  They couldn't have looked less interested and one of the girls was wearing her \"uniform\" black tshirt hiked up over her bare belly tightly knotted on the side.  Not only did we have to look at that, but when she leaned over to select toppings, her stomach laid on the pizza! Sorry...can't make this stuff up.  Will NEVER return!",

    "text": "My first visit to this V3 location will also be my last, as that visit was difficult and chaotic.   I walked in wanting to get dinner to-go. Note that when you walk in, you walk past some tables and a biiiiig menu on the wall. Since the line was moving so slowly, I went ahead and read the menu on the wall while I waited.  That was a mistake, since the big menu that grabs your eyes while you're in line is NOT their daily menu. The items on it are available on rotation, as a Special of the Day sort of deal. Why in the world they've designed their eatery to prominently feature food that's not constantly available, I don't know. They have printed menus as well, so...put the specials there, too?  But whatever. Since I'd been thinking of two different flatbreads, I went ahead and just ordered the one. Honestly, since I was trying to get home I don't think I had the energy or desire to pick something else at that point. Let alone making something else, since one of V3's claims to fame is the ability to make your own customized flatbread.   By the way, V3 does deserve credit for having so many food options. A regular menu, the make-it-your-way menu, and a rotating specials menu. That's a lot of flatbread possibilities!  So. At this point in the visit, I'm ready to pay and to get my food. However, I kid you not, the man running the register literally turned away from me after ringing out the person in front of me; watched the other workers making flatbreads for a minute straight; and then strolled off to the back. Not once did he look at me or speak to me about why he was waiting, what was on his mind, where he was going, etc. Let me be clear - being on your feet all day is hard. I don't mind someone walking off and getting a drink or taking a minute to let the staff \"catch up\" on an influx of orders. Just. Tell me that's what you're doing. Communicate. Keep me as the customer posted on what to expect.  Eventually another lovely gentlemen got me through the payment part of the visit (honestly he was the nicest person in the whole place), and he gave me a number for my order. I have no idea why anyone bothered assigning numbers, though, since not a single person actually called out the numbers. Instead they began scrambling and shouting out the names of the flatbreads being finished. I even had to remind them which order was mine a couple times because they would try to bring me the wrong one.  The whole visit was a mess, and I was so happy when I finally left with my flatbread box in hand. If this was a new eatery, I'd be more understanding, but clearly given the dates on their reviews, they've had more than enough time to work out the glitches in their system. Disorganization plus rude staff? I don't care how good the flatbread was in the end (which it was) - I won't be back here.",

This place is super, super fun.  So you go in and you can pick any toppings, your sauce, and your crust and it's only about $8. WHATTTT! Yeah I know! You get a personal flat bread for that low price.   The flat bread appeals to me because I like a little crunch to my crust. Personally thin crust is my all time fave.   The pizza cooks pretty fast and a lot of people were in and out while we sat and ate. I got a lot of interesting toppings and some fun flavored oils sprinkled on the top. You can also get some cold toppings once the pizza is finished. You pick what you want. It was fun.  I will say that this place was better than expected. I liked my pizza and even had leftovers since it was a big flatbread. Annnddd remember to get your card punched. 9 times gets you a free pizza I believe!",

The coworkers were incredibly rude, disrespectful and verbally abusive toward him. They spoke and behaved this way in front of me and 2 other customers. In hindsight, I should have spoken up for him. I was just stunned that they could be so outrageously awful toward a trainee. I hope they look for other jobs if they're so miserable, or I hope the young man gets out and finds some place to work where the people won't treat him like dirt.",

After it came out, I was asked about addition finishings that included parmesan cheese, basil, and arugula! Life is better with arugula. I then made my way to the condiment bar which featured oil and peppers. Added some red pepper flakes and made my way back to the office.   I sat down and prepared myself for lunch. Delicious. Warm. I ate half the flatbread, saving the rest for another lunch. Very solid option in the neighborhood. At $8 for the featured flatbread or create your own, it's a reasonable option.",

    "text": "$8 flat rate for any pizza. It's definitely a good deal. They have some signature pizzas that you can choose from or you can choose to build your own. The concept is very similar to the many fast casual restaurants that are popping up (Chipotle, Qdoba, Subway, etc.)   If you choose to build your own, you get unlimited toppings for the flat rate of $8. They have numerous sauce options that you can pick from for the base of your pizza, so it makes it easy to be adventurous with your creation. The meats, cheeses, and veggies are plentiful in choices as well. They do not have a shortage of toppings to choose from! They have something for everyone here!   I have eaten here a few times and I have not been disappointed with the quality of food or service. I have had a chance to have a conversation with Tony, the owner, and he is genuinely a good guy who cares about all of his customers.   It's a good place to pick up a quick meal, and I plan on returning for future visits.",

The pizza came out quickly and was surprisingly delicious. It wasn't burnt, and wasn't undercooked. Seriously cooked to perfection.They need to do better on the fountain drink choices though.",

We order 8-9 flatbreads per working lunch a week and he has never messed up one order. They are made very quickly and he even labels the boxes for us!  Thank you Tony for going above and beyond, your flatbreads are delicious!",

It was super delicious and I loved that you could choose garnishes for your pizza after it cooked.   The staff could've been more attentive and kind but other than that, I will be back!",
