    "text": "Like probably most of the patrons in here on a Monday night, I was staying at the Hilton next door.  I got to the hotel at 8pm after flying all day and then driving from the airport so I didn't really feel like venturing out into an unfamiliar area for dinner.  I sat at the bar, which had a couple TV's on.    I was quickly greeted by a rather attractive bartender who welcomed me and took my drink order.  When she returned with my glass of house Pinot Noir, she asked if I needed a dinner menu.   A minute or two later she brought me a dinner menu and told me about the specials.  The Pinot wasn't the best glass of wine, but decent enough. A few minutes later after I closed my menu, another bartender (a far less attractive male) stopped by to see if I wanted to order or just hang out for a while.  I really appreciate service that's attentive like this without being pushy.    I was hungry so I ordered, but he probably would have been cool if I'd sat there all night sipping my wine.  And I suppose I can't fault the guy for not being the attractive young lady who'd originally been serving me ;)  I started with the Shrimp & Chorizo Chowder which was excellent.  I'd put it on the \"must have\" list for anybody dining here.  I had one of the specials, the blackened monk fish, as my entree.  It was also quite good, but perhaps slightly underdone in the center.  I'm talking just barely though and it was a thick piece of fish.  The roasted garbanzo beans and potato puree were excellent as well and complimented the seasoning on the fish quite well.  They also brought me a basket of bread which was probably overkill but both varieties I tried where a nice compliment to the chowder.     I had a second glass of wine, this time a Cab.  The bartender commented that the Pinot wasn't his favorite either as he brought me the second glass.  All in all, for what I was wanting that evening it was just about perfect; just on the edge of getting 5 starts from me in fact, which I never do.  I don't know when I'll be back in the area and I'm usually not one to stay in the hotel for dinner, but Jackson's just might tempt me to do so next time.  Even if I don't get the pretty bartender next time.",

In particular the scallop appetizer was particularly appealing. Shrimp and chorizo soup and tomato bisque were both flavorful. The entrees were a small letdown. My wife tried monkfish for the first time and was not impressed, more by the fish than the preparation.  My beef tips were tender but not overly flavorful.  We agreed we would like to return. The prices were a little high, but overall we were happy. The next visit I will likely limit myself to an appetizer/soup OR an entree. Not only will that be more healthy it will be a bit less expensive too.",

Bazzano  Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh/Southpointe  1000 Corporate Drive  Canonsburg Pa 15317  Paul, appreciate the investigation, exactly what was investigated, can you detail for me.  As I said service excellent, I tipped well, 2 Cheese plates good, food not so good. Is that all?  Frankly, I had a good time.  I am not asking for much, except a refund for the meals. If these are your thoughts on the matter, service and quality count. I will never eat there again nor could I by conscience stay at that Hilton again, nor could I recommend to any that it is worth the time or money. I work for a large company in the area, oil and gas, what should I say... stay at the Hilton and get MC D's to go, you will enjoy more than Jacksons. Marketing is everything, I'd prefer a refund of the money, for the meals, simple and easy.  Cook had a hangover.., bad day...?  Happens.  Your Thoughts please, and normally I do not bitch, but the truth is, meals bad. I appreciate your time- Jon  Never heard another word",

    "text": "I live within a few miles of Jacksons, but I recently went there for the first time. The standard reviews I've heard from word of mouth were all along the lines of 'nice, a little upscale, expensive but good, etc.'   My favorite Local band was playing there Friday night, so that was all I needed to give it a try.    Everything I heard about the place was True. The ambiance was nice. It was everything you'd expect from a nice hotel restaurant. The menu wasn't huge, but there was a diverse selection.   Our table of four to six quickly became a table for ten, which the restaurant accommodated even after two of us arrived early and were seated. The host and server were very professional and accommodating.   Presentation was obviously important to the restaurant and it showed. Maybe I'm not as upscale as most people, but everything was lovely without being pretentious. I ordered the soup du jour (shrimp bisque) which was phenomenal. For $6, I expected a tiny cup, but it was a generous sized portion in a bowl.    While I'm not a fancy salad guy, I figured I've give the chop salad a go. It was better than I expected. It's hard to screw up a salad, but I've seen it done before. The candied walnuts were terrific. For my entree, I ordered the scallops in ginger sauce. The menu said they were served with ramen noodles and I've really wanted to expand my ramen experiences. I was a poor college student once and I still like cheap ramen on occasion. I know you can get good ramen out there, so I figured I'd give it a go. It came with four scallops and a heaping portion of ramen mixed with some vegetables in a ginger sauce. I have a decent sized appetite, but I had to get the last of my meal to go. I ate it today (cold) and it was still good.   Add a couple of Guinness drafts for me and we had a hefty bill, but I don't think that would stop me from returning again. Besides, if you use the 'other' restaurant reservation app that's the opposite of 'Closed Table', it's a 1,000 point restaurant.   The restrooms were exceptionally clean and the staff was friendly. The bar area was crowded, but it was a Friday (early) evening. The band was supposed to play out on the patio, but the weather curtailed that idea. I would be excited to re-visit Jacksons and dine outside.    Four of five stars in my review, but only because I can't give 4.5 out of 5. I think the prices could be cut back a little and the set-up was a little odd for a two-piece musical group. Also, the chairs might be good for people with perfect posture, but it felt like they made me lean too far forward. A weird thing, I know, but others may party mentioned the same thing.   Definitely give it a try if you don't mind dropping a C-note on dinner for two.",

They didn't have any neither offered to try making one. No worries there, meat happens. But then when I started eating my wrap, it had way too much salt in it. Like \"they put salt in, and then they forgot they put it in and doubled up on it\" much. I wanted to be as polite as possible and waited for someone to ask me how my food was. No one did. Then I looked around a little helplessly like you do when you're flanked by taller people in a booth setting, but to no avail.   So it came down to just making do w/ fries or eat tablespoons of salt and make do with water. I chose the latter and needless to say, left with a bad taste in my mouth.   Their fries are good though!",

For lunch, I order the cheesesteak, which had good flavor but they put au jus on the bread instead of giving it on the side for dipping so by the time your sandwich gets to you it's falling apart a bit. My coworker ordered the ham and cheese on pretzel bun. I stole a bite and it was really good and cheesy.   For dinner, I ordered their ribeye special which came with lemony broccolini and a crazy good blue cheese sauce. The sides are different for the special, but they always have a ribeye on the menu and believe me, you should order it. They cook it on their mesquite grill that beautifully charred the meat but left the inside juicy and perfectly medium. A restaurant rarely cooks the steak to the right temp that you ask for, so that was a very pleasant surprise. There wasn't too much fat in the ribeye either, which was great. It was delicious and made the whole dinner worth it. My coworker ordered the meat sauce pasta and said she loved it! Dinner service was SOOO slow though, so that's why I'm taking off a point. Oh and their Bloody Mary was really bad and watered down, so if you're craving one, this isn't the place for it.",

The only thing I could say that they could improve on is wait time. The food came out a little slow but it could be do to a number of different things.",

I had the prime rib and it was a huge portion!  I was disappointed though as it was tough and not a lot of flavor other than the peppery rub on the outside.  My husband had the mahi mahi and it was over cooked.  Our friends had the scallops and though the scallops were done nicely, there were just three in the dish and  way too much pasta to round out the entree.  The noise level in the restaurant was quite unpleasant.  I will say the wait staff was very good and so was the wine selection.  I wished I had enjoyed the evening more but the food didn't shine and the noise was deafening.  Unfortunately we probably won't return.",

We had lunch there yesterday and the smell from my clothes has carried over into my hotel room overnight.  If you're ok with having to air them out and have a day or so before packing your clothes back into a suitcase to fly, then this is a great choice in the local area to grab a meal.",

    "text": "Jackson's is a staple for us and I highly recommend you try them if you are looking for good food and good service.  They have wonderful food and we have never been disappointed in anything we have ordered.  They regularly have specials, and they are in the process of adding additional items to the menu and/or rotating some new dishes into their repertoire.  We have had just about everything on their menu.  Steak, fish, meat sauce (a hearty and delicious pasta dish), duck, crab cake, the shrimp & chorizo chowder, calamari, and of course, desserts which change regularly....and we have enjoyed all of these dishes.   Jackson's starts your meal out with a wonderful basket of bread and spreads, including their cheese/herb bread sticks which are made in their wood fired oven with their wonderful pizza dough.  They are addictive, so be careful not to indulge too much before your meal shows up!   We often times will get a Caesar, house salad, or wedge salad.  They are all good and satisfy my need for a crisp salad.  Do try the red velvet cheesecake if it is on the menu when you go.  You will be delighted.  But we have enjoyed the creme brulee and other desserts that are rotated seasonally.    The service is warm, friendly, and spot on.  Ask for Martin or Ruth.  They will treat you very well and help you with any questions you have.  They know us quite well by now.  The restaurant has several different dining areas to meet your desires for the time.  They have a bar area, an outdoor seating area with live music on the weekends, and the indoor dining room.  The decor has been recently updated at it is sharp and appealing.    Do NOT be thrown off by the fact that it is directly adjacent to a hotel.  It is not hotel food by any stretch.  This restaurant is a gem that you should try.",

At least that's why I ate there, and while I don't necessarily regret choosing this seemingly fancy diner that evening, I don't plan on coming back in the near or distant future.   The food was fine, and I do feel bad that I squished the tiny bug which ran across my salad plate.   The waiter was nice (unlike another reviewer here I did not have the luck of being served by an attractive waitress) although not terribly speedy when it came to clearing the table or bringing the bill.   At least the dinner was better than the breakfast they offer at the Hilton. Although I didn't actually bother to try that to be honest.",

My fries left a little to be desired as they were clearly the end of the batch that had just been cooked but it didnt really bother me too much. The restaurant itself is nice, with a large bar and nice, high-backed chairs everywhere. The group in town for the wedding hung out each night and had a great time. After the wedding on Friday night, the owner kept the place open until 2AM which was very nice of him.",

The interior decor is very nice and romantic and even has a beautiful fire place making it a great place for date night. There is also a patio to enjoy during the warmer months. Our service has always excellent and very attentive.  The menu has something for everyone. Burgers, soups, sandwiches, pizza and much more. They also offer a $10 Power Lunch which includes a beverage. Sandwiches come with a pickle and coleslaw as well as your choice of French Fries or fresh vegetables. I highly recommend the Crab Mac and Cheese though as it is incredible. It features Lump crab meat, cheddar, smoked gouda, bacon over cavatappi pasta and all I ever get.  Their desserts are superb also. They change seasonally, so you'll always have something new to try. During my first visit they were featuring a S'mores bread pudding which I had to try! It was spectacular!  If you are ever looking for somewhere different from the usual lineup of restaurants I highly recommend Jackson's.",

They were super busy, but the service started out great.  We got the shrimp and crab Mac and cheese appetizer and it was def our favorite thing of the night. That and the wood fired cheesy bread that my husband could not stop raving about.  I started with the wedge salad and he got the chowder. He loved the soup. I had a taste and I agreed. The wedge, however, was drenched in dressing. And I never say that. I usually like a lot of dressing but it was way too much.  We both ordered the prime rib and both of our cuts were slightly over cooked. I ordered mine medium rare and it came out very slightly pink.  Once our food was dropped off, we never saw our server again. Never came to check on us or ask how the meal was. After we were done eating, we waiting 25 mins before we saw him to ask for the check.  However, we will be returning again because everyone on NYE got a $20 dining credit for a 2019 visit, so we will see how it goes!",

We went tonight for our anniversary and were just as pleased. Both times we got the tasting menu. The crab cake there is so very delicious. No filler. Just delicious crab meat. The chopped salad was really good and I really enjoyed the white French dressing they use on it. I have gotten the Filet and today I got the scallops and while both were delicious I preferred the filet. The tasting menu gives you a choice of any appetizer, most entrees, salad or soup, and dessert for $55. To us that's an amazing price for the amount of food you are getting. We will definitely be going to Jackson's more often and requesting Martin. He just makes the experience that much more enjoyable. I like that you don't feel like they are rushing you out. Oh and Martin brought us two glasses of celebratory champagne!",

They offer certain dishes with certain sides, and the servers get very upset when you ask them to substitute something. Upon receiving your food, you will find that the portion sizes are subpar, and the food is mediocre, considering the standard it is held to.   I have been to Jacksons quite a few times (even for wedding rehearsal dinners) and have had a pretty bland experience every time. You would think that for the amount of money you're spending, the servers would be around more and be a bit friendlier. However, I guess if you're getting gratuity on a very high priced meal, you aren't that concerned with customer service.   If you are going on a date, I would plan on spending minimum $130. Obviously this is way more if you get drinks, dessert, etc.",

It's a little pricey and upscale, but the specials are good and pretty tasty.   The outdoor patio is nice. Ceiling fans help keep it cool.   Servers are friendly. Food service is kinda slow.",

    "text": "Their Berkshire pork chop with bacon jam is insane! Looks like the murder weapon. Their Bacon Jam Burger is the most delicious mess ever. (Get extra napkins). Their chopped salad is so good and with salmon thrown on a meal in itself. Steak tip appetizer with horseradish sauce is yum. And now for you lucky people who can scarf down the carbs without consequence LOBSTER SHRIMP MAC AND CHEESE. Eat it soon because someday there will be a law against it. It's crunchy and gooey and decadent with each layer you dig into a new taste adventure. Great service. Great kitchen staff. Great bartenders. And drinks like chocolate martinis, grapefruit basil martinis and a pineapple martini with pineapple that died in good spirits. Going tonight!!!!",

    "text": "My schedule had me dining twice at Jackson's in the same day this week. Once for lunch and once for a bite to eat during happy hour. Both times left me quite underwhelmed. To start with lunch. I had the Club Sandwich which may have been the worst club sandwich that I have ever had. Some cold cuts pilled tightly on two pieces of limp white bread with a handful of overcooked French fries. Yuck. My lunch companion had an underwhelming salmon salad.   Later in the day I met a colleague for Happy Hour at the bar and had their Brie Dip and Pita Bread. The Brie Dip was horrible (and I love Brie) and the Pita chips were cold and lifeless. No reason to ever order this again.   This may be a good place to get a drink but there are so many other good places around to eat. If this place had to stand alone instead of being tied to a restaurant it would be out of business",

    "text": "The food was very good.  Don't go here if you have anywhere to be in a few hours, however.  The service lacks in regards to the waitress decided she wanted to bring the bread and tapanade (along with the cheesy bread) after the appetizers/soup/salad, as that was her plan.  Said she had \"a method to the madness.\"  I wanted my bread like other restaurants, when I first get there.  She was good with refilling the water frequently.  The shrimp and lobster mac n cheese was great, as was the shrimp/lobster bisque.  Salads were tasty.  Then it stopped.  1.5 hours and still no entree.  People came and seated beside us had all their food and finished, doggy bag ready to go, and we were still waiting for our entrees.  We asked waitress for check and to stop everything.  Manager did come by and was very kind, offered to give us the food to take with us if ready, did not have us pay for anything, and apologized for us having a bad experience.  We did see that the chefs in the back were busy the whole night, but perhaps they need more staff on certain occasions.  Would like to go back but just am concerned my evening would be spent waiting...and waiting.",
