But there are a few coffee shops that attempt to break the mold. And I don't mean mold as in fungus. The folks at Labella Bean have gone the extra step to not only serve coffee, but serve up some seriously good food as well. Everything is made to order by some very dedicated people in the back. The people at the counter are always friendly and get to know you by name. The choices for food in the suburban wasteland known as Bridgeville are slim, but \"The Bean\" does a damn good job by any standards.",

    "text": "What a lovely surprise this little stretch of Main Street USA (actually Washington Ave.) has turned out to be. Not only one of my fave restaurants is here in Bridgeville ('Burgh's Pizza & Wings), but now a new favorite coffee/sandwich shop. This place serves up good coffee and truly good food. I'd been driving around all morning and was headed for Bridgeville when I remembered that they serve lunch here. I've only had coffee here in the past, but liked the vibe, and thought I'd give it a try. The sandwich and salad menu is brief but interesting. I went for a half of the Chicken & Fresh Mozzerella Cheese sandwich on multi grain ciabatta...love that they offer that bread choice, which enveloped the chicken, mozz, roasted red peppers and artichoke spread beautifully; hearty, but not overly so. The artichoke spread was wonderful...a bit garlicky, but simple enough to just nicely enliven the other ingredients. With chips and a pickle the half sandwich was enough for my appetite, which lessens as the temperature goes up, and it's 90 degrees out there today. As I mentioned, I like the vibe here, which is casual yet friendly. Really, I could sit here all day listening to the James Taylor they had playing at just the right low volume. LaBella offers bagels, quiche, oatmeal and muffins for breakfast, and they have a nice selection of pies, cakes, cookies and pastries. They have brewed coffee, espresso, fruit tea smoothies, blended iced coffee drinks and frozen hot chocolate this time of year. If I lived within walking distance I'd be here every morning.",

On three occasions I was given an order that was not what I specified. The reason this is such a problem is I didn't find out until I got to my office which is a bit of a distance from LaBella. This meant driving the whole way back to get the order that I should have had the first time, and let me tell you, I have NEVER been comped for their mistakes. Heck, I've never even been apologized to. The last time they screwed up, one of the employees scowled at me and said, \"It's right this time. you can check it yourself.\" Why thank you, I sure did. The staff is overall unpleasant to deal with and the wait time is ridiculous. I've been told an order will take 15 minutes and 40-45 minutes later, I'm still waiting. I have only given this place multiple chances b/c I work in Bridgeville and there are few good places to eat. Well, I found a nice replacement up the hill at Cucina Bella so I'll spend my money there.",

    "text": "Super cute little coffee shop!    I stumbled upon this on a quiet Sunday afternoon while waiting to go to a christening out in Bridgeville.  I was completely out of my city element and looking for a place to hop into with free wifi to hop on the internets for a bit.  Between a couple lunch places this seemed to be one of the only spots open.  Not surprising for a tiny little town trapped among the shopping plaza meccas.    I went against natural instinct and got the \"special.\" A nutella cappuccino.  I felt that I had to clarify if this was a real cappuccino or a \"fake\" one.  \"Fake\" being what convenient stores call a cappuccino but it's just a latte.  This cap was disguised as a latte as I suspected.  So I was into it!  Even as a latte it was one STRONG latte.  They must use a pretty strong espresso because it was a kick in the espresso booty.  This usual chai loving girl got her butt kicked by it!  I noticed they also have a plethora of brunch and lunch options so if i was ever around Bridgeville again I'd like to stop by and try something local instead of, say, Sonic (even though I admit I do love me some tator tots).    The best part for me was the atmosphere.  Incredibly spacious and inviting.  Lots of large comfy chairs to settle yourself in for a while.  Also, there's a good amount of tables and chairs to enjoy brunch/lunch.    The atmosphere was just so warm and inviting that it won me over even though I hadn't sampled much of the fare.  Check out the food options for me, friends in Bridgeville, and let me know whatcha think!",

Never had the food so I can't comment on that. The service is always good and the girls that work there are always nice and polite.The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because of the fact the temperature of the coffee can be scolding hot at times. I'm picky when it comes to my coffee, and I always like it to be served at an immediate drinking temperature, especially whenever you visit somewhere that specializes in serving coffee. My thought is that every time I've been to Eat N' Park (no matter what location) the coffee is always the perfect temperature. If they can do it, why can't everyone else. Definitely a great place to stop, and I would suggest this if your in the area.",

This ain't the place sweetheart. This is where the locals go, where business in Bridgeville gets done, where Main Street USA's morning ritual begins. Always super friendly service, coffee is not quite *bucks strong but delicious (think a few notches above McDonald's best), delicious selection of pastries and an atmostphere that's like your Mom giving you a rib cracking hug. Without question a great place. A little more selection of breakfast pastries and a little decor updating would vault them to a solid 5 star rating.   An essential piece of 21st century Americana.",

As I was sipping on a perfectly prepared cappuccino (foamy and not too filling) I wondered if anyone had written any reviews on this quaint cafe. To my surprise there hasn't been, and Labella has been open since 2001.  La Bella Bean began as a neighborhood cafe before every street corner became dusted with corporate coffee shops and hipster recreations. The coffee is nothing short of delicious,  I have never been disappointed with their drip coffee or their latte's and cappuccinos. The biscotti is familiar to Pittsburghers -the same is served in crazy mocha - but their pastries and desserts are all homemade and have never failed to be divine.   The cafe has daily specials, ranging from a comforting egg salad sandwich served with warm tomato bisque, to their famous white chicken chili. Whatever you choice to get please make it a high priority to taste their homemade balsamic vinaigrette! They put it on top of their LaBella bruschetta, Roma veggie sandwich, not to mention their salads and various other sandwichs. I've never tasted a balsamic vinaigrette  that did not slap me in the face with an overtly vinegar taste, however this balsamic has just the right amount of flavor and pungency. Please try it, I beg of you!   As to the service, always superb! I live in Shadyside and my family lives in Washington county, so every time I'm heading home I make it a point to stop by for a quick lunch and some great coffee.",

I work from coffee shops pretty often, and I'm always amazed that more of them don't invest in a decent kitchen. La Bella Bean has been serving food for years, and it's excellent. I recommend the quiche or the La Bella Bagel. I haven't tried the salads, but other customers seem to rave about them.  The only downside is the parking. It's metered, and patrolled by ninjas.

Lunch was one of the better ones I've had in a while - spinach strawberry Gorgonzola salad.  My friend had a veggie quiche which looked good.  Portions were more than enough.  And the last stand out thing to me was the staff.  They were very friendly and quite willing to provide recommendations.  A definite must try!",

    "text": "So I have lived in Bridgeville for 4+ years and I had never stopped at Labella Bean before because I don't like coffee and thought that would be all they offered.    Anyway, a great friend of mine asked me to meet him there for lunch one day and thank goodness I said yes!  Right off, the people behind the counter recognized my friend by first name...and this is just from visiting there as a customer.  It was cold outside, and seeing the couch by the fireplace made me feel as if I was home.  Everyone, and I do mean everyone, was SO friendly and even more excited to know that it was my first time there!    I had what is now officially the world's BEST chai tea...EVER!  It is so creamy and tasty!  I also got this awesome Strawberry Salad and Veggie Sandwich too...both to die for!   I loved the chai so much that I went back a couple of days later and took another friend who agrees about the chai!  And she IS a chai snob!  I had a BLT and delicious Tomato Bisque Soup and they were even better than the first meal!    Anyway, I HIGHLY recommend this hidden treasure to all of you out there.  It has a home vibe to it, the employees are so friendly, and the food and drinks are out of this world!  What more can one ask for??",

Not only the coffee is fresh and hot, but the can make anything Starbucks can make and more! But the beauty of this place is the food! Wow, I mean it's really good!! The soup and sandwiches are amazing and so is everything else I have ever ordered here! Breakfast and lunch it's all good. It gets s but busy but I almost never had to wait. The staff are friendly and helpful and very good. Parking is a pain, but it's bridgeville, what do you expect? Don't waste your time or money driving past to go to a fast food place or coffee place, stop here on your way to or from 79, you will thank me!",

I had high hopes for this place as I tend to lean more toward independent shops vs Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts.   The ambiance is nice and the location is great. The staff was friendly. We ordered a chai chiller and a white satin mocha.   The chai chiller was ok, it lacked cinnamon and had a sweeeter taste than I expected. My wife couldn't finish her white satin mocha. She expected a creamier drink vs a sugary one. I took a sip and it was way too sweet for me.   Our next visit we'll try something else to see if it was just those drinks or if it's standard.",

The frozen hot chocolate is great in the summer! Overall, a great place to grab lunch in the Bridgeville area.",

Both were good and the ingredients all tasted high quality. The sandwiches came with a pesto/sun dried tomato pasta salad which was also very good. I also had an iced coffee which was delicious. I would give it 5 stars but I have to be honest, I wasn't that blown away by the service. The two at the front counter seemed to be very young girls and they didn't seem very interested in helping us. I also watched them be kind of snotty to a gentleman getting a to go order which was a little off putting. Overall, I'd try it again in hopes the service is better, but it definitely put a damper on an otherwise good experience.",

    "text": "I really don't know what the problem is with the pay metered parking at this place except for takeout purposes. The lot charges $.75 per hour which to me is very reasonable compared to most of the city lots I've parked in that charge a lot more. Labella Bean is next to an Armstrong's express which I would imagine comes of the parent restaurant.  So I decided to go in and try it out. This place is very charming to walk into. The staff were exceeding friendly and helpful. Since it was late in the day I was unable to try their lunch menu but they have a great variety of sweet treats to go with your coffee or expresso. Most of their desserts come from other sources but they do make their own chocolate chip cookies.  I learned that the brew of the day was \"chocolate cherry kiss.\" They let me sample it and yes it was love at first taste! I ordered a small cup of that and believe me it did not disappoint! You can taste the chocolate in it! I was in love with the blend that I wanted to purchase it. They told me that since it was limited for Valentine's Day they ground the last of it for tomorrow and asked me to return so I could try their food and their daily specials. They had no more to sell. This place does have a rewards punch card based on the number of beverages you buy so they gave me one to start with.  With your check in you can get $5.00 off your purchase so I saved mine for the return visit. The place is set up both homestyle with couches , coffee tables, etc. and business like with tables and chairs. There is a long counter table up front where you can sit and work on your laptop and yes they even have charging rods for your Apple or Android device! They have their own free WiFi which gives a strong connection. They have various merchandise for sale. In addition to coffee, expressos, etc, they sell tea, hot chocolate,smoothies, and iced drinks. All beverage items are on a chalkboard and their daily specials are listed on another chalkboard. When I asked about the price they told me the daily specials average around $9.00.  You can also order pickup directly from the Yelp app.  One of the things that intrigued me was that they make and bottle their own salad dressing. Most of them are vinaigrettes of some sort. They bottle sells for $5.00 but you can get a travel size bottle for $1.00. Since I have not tried any of their salads I can't speak for them outside of the fact that it is a bit pricey for salad dressing.  Labella Bean is located in Bridgeville not even a mile down the road from the I-79 interchange that can take you back to the city exit within a reasonable amount of time. Will definitely return to try out not only their other blends but try one of their lunches.",

    "text": "I came to this place looking for something local in the area to pass some time. I always enjoy a good family coffee shop. I didn't wanna settle for dd or Starbucks and there's not much of a choice in the area. On walking in sadly I was not greeted being the lady behind the counter was having a conversation with a guest and the other lady was in the back kitchen. I had already had breakfast for the day so I just wanted something sweet. I looked over the menu options and I found chocolate chip cookies (I'm a sucker for chocolate chip) so I decided to settle on that with a glass of whole milk. I'm not to much of a coffee drinker anymore being if I do I like to make my own cold brew or Turkish coffee at home. Not to sure if the cookies are made in store or ordered out but I've read in previous reviews the cookies are baked fresh. I asked if the cookie could be warmed up and she said of course! She walked in the back for about 10 seconds and came back. I walked to the table to sit down the cookie was barely even warm :( as for the milk goes I said I would be dining in and she poured it into a plastic cup. I wish with me dining in I could have got a small clear glass cup or a coffee mug. I must say tho that the design on the plastic cups are pretty cool and colorful. I was disappointed to see this place use to have a check in offer for yelp first time check ins. The music at this place was welcoming and at a decent volume to where you could hear each other talking but still hear the music. It was freezing in here being it's right before 9am and still so cold outside. I noticed they have a fire pit but sadly it was not on so I kept my jacket on the whole time to stay warmish. I do like how they have a black board on the wall with the weekly specials. They also have outlets and a charging station for guest to use. Luckily I didn't have to worry about parking being i car pooled and got dropped off because with it being so early the parking lot is already half full and it's shared with other establishments. Overall it's just another coffee shop nothing really stands out to me about it. The cookie was pretty average and could be better. I would return again to pass some time and try something else.",

She was speaking to me as though I had made a huge mistake, I then said to her all it is is a latte with no foam. By the way Starbucks was not the first to have flat whites, I have gotten them at other coffee shops before Starbucks ever had them (she was saying that SB was the only place I could get one). This was not my first time visiting LaBella bean but it is my last, I hope if it was the owner that was taking care of me, she will read this and maybe take from this review how to speak to her customers. The coffee and drinks are well made, its just disappointing when you walk into a place and you are made to feel like you are an idiot or putting them out.",

Ordered the salad that was on special and it came with really wonderful fresh delicious dessert bread - yum. The salad, however, I believe (could be wrong) had pre-fabbed \"grilled chicken\" you know like it comes that way pre-cooked from the distributor? Greens not all so fresh. Could it be u ordered to go? The BBQ sauce seemed like a generic bottle. The tortilla strips were also pre fav, pretty unoriginal all around. This place is gorgeous and seems to have a super cool ambiance. Maybe they just wanted to have an easy diverse lunch special menu... I'd have been happier with something simple as pear or apple with some Swiss .... Keep it local keep it fresh. And $10 with tax was a bit more than I expected coming from the city... Maybe have a smaller slice of dessert bread ? Hoping to change my mind upon return!!!",

Hot chocolate is very good. Cappuccino is strong, but I like weak coffee, so just add lots of sweetener - then it is perfect (sorry, coffee connoisseurs)! The raisin crunch toast is awesome and very filling, but now you have to ask for it because it's not on display anymore(?). I tried the tuna salad on a baguette and was told, \"You won't regret it\" - True. Nice, white, flaky tuna that looked like fish(!) instead of some yellow, creamy, mystery blend. It's not huge, but I took half home for dinner because it was more filling than I anticipated. The homemade quiche was delicious and very filling - I liked the one with crispy bacon on top better than the ham.  Nice atmosphere - table, \"bar\", or couch seating. Chargers for your devices at bar. When you sit by the large, street-side windows, you almost feel like you're outside. Staff are very pleasant, seems to be family owned.",

I love their mocha (on the strong side), sandwiches, salads, and an occasional chocolate peanut butter frappe. I would definitely recommend a mediterranean salad (I get mine with chicken), the dark cherry prosciutto salad, and crispy apple chicken salad. For sandwiches I love muffuletta, ham & brie panini, and chicken mozzarella. I'm a self-described starbucks junky, but this place would have all my business if they were closer to me.  It does get busy during lunch times so it's great they have an option to text your order so it'll be ready by the time you get there. The one thing I don't like is the metered parking.

    "text": "After essentially being rushed out of nearby Burgh's, Kay and I still craved dessert. Quickly scanning the neighborhood, I noticed Labella Bean along this unsung suburban business district. As a sweets-hound, I know that coffee shops often sell delectable desserts. Success.   I may not be a coffee drinker, but I enjoy the devil out of hot chocolate, and Labella bean makes one killer, steaming cup of the brew. As rich, smooth, and decadent as liquified truffles, Labella's hot cocoa is an elixir of endorphins without equal. Akin to drinking hot fudge and heavy cream blended together, the thermal beverage is such a strong dessert in its own right that I almost didn't bother to order a wedge of their Snicker's cake.   The cake was a mild disappointment with its bland buttercream frosting and somewhat dry body. Considering its ingredients and theme, I expected it to be a mouthful of sugarymenace. Nonetheless, it quelled a craving even if l regretted not going with my original choice in the salted caramel brownies.   The interiors are extremely spacious and cozy, and the staff are eager to make you feel as if you're visiting family.  If every bar was replaced with a coffee shop, the world would be less obnoxious. That's why it is promising for me to see a place like Labella Bean in a forgotten area such as Bridgeville; it brings a little of the East End to the South Hills. Come on by, get some work done or catch up on some reading, and have some lunch, breakfast, dessert or coffee while you're at it.",

The Panini's and sandwiches are great, and the pasta salad that comes on the side has great flavors as well.  Highly recommend for lunch!",

My favorites are the panini sandwiches and melts as well as the crispy apple chicken salad. Their desserts are equally amazing...I recommend the multi-layer chocolate cake with chocolate icing!",
