Does not take long and the smells are oh so good, makes you mouth water.  Watch out some of the salsa's are hhhhooooooooooooooot!     Several slections of the type of taco: carne asada, carnita, chorizo and a thin rib eye or get a combo.    Taco stand is open on weekends and I think on Fridays in the summer but call to check out the hours if that is why you are going.  If your looking for good tacos or a mexican grocery, this is the place.",

I have noticed that they over-salt the meat as they're cooking it .  Wish they'd lighten up on that .  That's my only complaint .  The Berumen brothers who own the 4 locations seem to be doing very well. You never see either of them at the Brookline location anymore .  I buy various items inside the store, some of the meats at the back meat counter and a lot of the produce .  I think a lot of the people that come from other 'hoods and towns never step inside .  You should .",

    "text": "Growing up near Chicago and in a Hispanic family, I am EXTREMELY picky about Mexican food, including street tacos. This place is spot on and couldn't be better! So authentic. You pay at the register of the grocery store (I didn't check the store out yet) and have your choice of meat. From memory, there was carnitas, chorizo, carne asada, pollo and bistec. The corn tortillas (only way to eat street tacos) are warm and made with lard. You can tell bc they don't break and are super amazingly delicious. I got cilantro and onion, again only way to eat street tacos and then went inside and added some of the little salsas they had in the salsa cart. It was cold, so I don't know if normally the cart is outside. Salsa was also fresh and spot on. Lots to choose from too. It was dirt cheap, another key part of street tacos and on point. Would recommend to anyone and writing this review made me want to go visit this spot soon! Viva!",

It's hard to believe you can get a delicious ribeye taco for $2.50!  The store is great too! They have a meat deli with marinated fajita mix, fresh chorizo, skirt steak, ribeye and pork. The prices are very reasonable. If you are a fan of Mexican food and authentic street tacos, you have to try Las Palmas.",

Back to the grocery store, in addition to some great Mexican specialities, which cost much less than at Giant Eagle, they have a great little produce section with very affordable prices. Example -- limes were five for $1 last week. And best of all is their carniceria (butcher shop). Tired of bags of frozen chicken breasts? Try theirs.",

    "text": "It's a grocery store. NO! It's a taco stand. NO! It's a silly novelty pinata peddler. It's really all of these things. After reading lots of reviews, and with a hankerin' for some delicious authentic tacos, the decision was made. It was below zero around dinner time, which made me wonder where they move this \"stand\" when it's frigid outside. Surely, they move it inside. THEY DO NOT. These friendly dudes were still there, outside the store.  Under a pop-up tent, just like in the Yelp photos. They were happily grilling meats and authentic from-scratch(!) corn tortillas. These guys are hard-core, and they put this same determination into their offerings. One of the guys told us that they're out there \"365 days of the week\", which probably feels pretty accurate when it's that cold outside.  For the anxious, here's the way it goes: 1. Stop outside where they're grilling. They will gladly show you the choices of meats (I believe they also do just veggies...). When I went, they had chorizo sausage, steak, fajita mix, chicken, and a few others. Let them know how many tacos you'd like - they're $2 each. I got three, and it was plenty. They'll put them in a styrofoam container.  2. Head inside the store. Just to the left, there's a salsa bar. Generally speaking, the milder toppings/sauces start on the left, and gradually get spicier toward the right. The guac is fantastic. The salsas are fresh and oh-so-good. The sauces don't disappoint, either. Don't be shy - load 'em up! I typically like my foods pretty spicy (ex: I frequently order my Thai food with a '10' on a '1-10' spicy scale), and the sauces all the way to the right don't disappoint. They're definitely on the hot side, but not overly-so.  3. (Optional) Stroll around the store, pick out a drink along the left-most wall. There are lots of choices - I'm a fan of the Jarritos drinks. Mango is awesome, and goes well with the tacos. There are some gems in this store - like nearly an entire aisle of just hot sauces, and lots of fresh produce. (The peppers looked amazing!)  4. Pay for your food at the front. Just let them know how many tacos you have. They're super friendly, but may not speak fluent English. Part of the charm and authenticity!  5. We were welcomed to stand in the store and eat our food, but we opted to take it home instead. There are no seats or tables inside, though.  I will definitely be back - for both tacos and Mexican ingredients for cooking.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Tuesday afternoon for lunch with my father.  I had noticed this place the week before whenever we went by and became eager to try it whenever I noticed its high rating on yelp.  Since I didn't go into the store, the only real thing I can comment on is the taco stand outside.  There was a guy behind the stand cooking everything as well as a condiment bar next to it.  Whenever we walked up he was just finishing up grilling some tortillas.  He greeted us in Spanish before giving us a run down of the taco fillers in English.  I ended getting three, one each of steak, chorizo and chicken.  He quickly made the tacos stuffing them very full.  They consisted of two tortillas with the filling which reminded me of truly authentic tacos.  Whenever I asked about paying he informed that I could pay cash outside or credit inside.  Since I had cash I quickly payed him and moved over to the condiment bar.  They had a number of sauces as well as some onions and a few other veggies.  I ultimately ended up choosing what I think was an avocado based sauce.  Once we were done with the condiments my father and I walked down the boulevard to find a public bench to eat our tacos on.  After sitting down I quickly dug in.  All three of them were delicious!  My favorite of the bunch ended up being the steak, followed by the chicken and lastly the chorizo.  The chorizo was the lone disappointment of the meal as I feel it lacked any spice at all but it was still pretty tasty.  The bottom line for me is that I will absolutely head back here again in the future.  The tacos were all really good and I think that they were a great value at $2.50 each.",

The \"salsa bar\" was clean, and well stocked.  the hot Chile Verde...VERY hot, in a good way.  Definitely adding this to my regular stops for lunch.",

The selection is quite complete - you can get anything from a selection of dried chilis to Salvadorian crema, and the produce is well priced as well!  There's even a full cooler if you want to buy some agua con gas or Jarritos!

There's no seating, but you can waltz down to the fire station to find a bench against the fence. Plenty of people can fit here. I find it's good to grab a few packs of the Maria shortbread cookies from the benevolent Goya company while here. They're good for post-taco dessert. Do not reveal that you're a Yinzer raised on Mad Mex by asking for sour cream and guac on your taco. That's tacky. Be the locally-eating globe-trotter by experimenting with the salsa bar. You'll learn to love your tacos with the fresh vegetables rather than the gloopy spreads.   Remember this isn't just a taco hut. You might also want to stock up on your chorizo and other meats here. You really can't go wrong. And the prices are all far better than Reyna's (bless their intents) in The Strip.",

    "text": "For South Hills residents who love a taco or ten this is the go to taquiera, hands down.  Like many, I've visited this taco stand countless times over the past couple years.  I've had their sensational, their great, their good, and their less than desirable tacos over time and am happy to write a review that is both candid and accurate.  Here it goes ...  The positives:  Competes successfully with Edgars leaving the other taco stands in Pittsburgh behind, Adequate selection of meats and/or proteins all of which change on a daily or semi-daily basis, Food is well cooked and rarely dry, their puerco and pastor are EXCELLENT, authentic double corn tortillas are the norm - cannot beat it, wide array of cart toppings, salsas, crema, and guacamole with spice and heat covering the range from mild to make your tongue melt, tacos are sufficient in size and well proportioned for their tortillas, truly mouthwatering food much more often than not to go with the jarritos found in the coolers inside, price point is exactly as it should be, in fact I may hit that cart up tonight with some radish, cilantro, white onion and their tomatillo sauce ... I cannot wait.  The negatives:  Really, there is only one negative worth mentioning with that being they definitely do not use the best cuts of meat often (though they cook what they use very well) and because of that their tacos aren't always top quality, no seating (or bathrooms) available, taco cart isn't the cleanest at times, like I wrote their food has been dry (mostly the asada) though not really often enough to consider truly a negative - I am nitpicking here.   So, to sum it up ... I don't think you can miss with this taco stand in Pittsburgh.  Obviously, they are busy and that tells the whole story.  I would say, though, if this cart was closer to the border they'd have to step up their meat quality (and maybe a little more spice too) to be considered good but in the South Hills they are the top dog and fighting for that moniker in the land of the three rivers.    Recommendation:  No brainer - YES, many times, over and over, til tacos are coming out your ears.  The only reason they don't get a fifth star?  ... Because this is a taco stand, not a restaurant, and it can be tough eating on the curb or hood of  your car.",

    "text": "Good mexican food of any kind is hard to come by in this city, let alone authentic street mexican food.  The tacos are dirt cheap, the guys working the stand enjoy what they're doing, and the self serve salsa bar is what dreams are made of.  It's pretty simple.    You choose a filling: carne asada, chorizo, barbacoa, pollo, carnitas, or potato poblano.  They pull two warmed corn tortillas off the flat top, stack them, and load it with enough to fill each of them individually.  You hand them two dollars. Well let's be honest, most likely you're going to hand them 6 or 8 dollars, because not only are they dirt cheap, they're the best roadside taco you can get in this city. Yes, even better than Reyna's lengua taco on one of their handmade tortillas. Close race, but Las Palmas wins.  Next, you step down the line to the salsa cart:  pico de gallo, whole roasted jalapenos, cilantro, avocado crema, mild salsa, medium salsa, hot salsa, habanero salsa, lime wedges, chopped onion, diced tomato.  The only additional cheap item I could think of to add to this salsa party is some shredded cabbage, but I sure as hell am not complaining. Grab some napkins and a fork and step aside.  They don't have any tables or chairs. There is plenty of curb space, concrete steps of nearby businesses, hell there's even a library drop box that can be used as a makeshift table.  Just find a place where you can stop for 3 1/2 minutes and make a complete mess of yourself.  The carne asada and chorizo are top notch, the others good if not great.  Don't sell yourself short. Go get a taco... or five.",

One receives taco and walks over to a neat and clean looking buffet of delicious looking toppings.  These toppings include salsa, salsa verde, gauc, tomatoes and onions.  One devours tacos in an animal like fashion because... they're delicious!  So for serious, they rocked my world!  And at $2 a pop you can buy a ton without breaking the bank!  I had the steak and the pork.  I liked the pork more because it was uber flavorful.  I also loved the toppings bar because I LOVE to dump toppings on as well.  Although at two tacos I stuffed myself and was full for hours (which does not usually happen!).    Do they beat out Reyna's tacos?  My answer would be they're on par but on different levels because they're just a different style.  That's just my observation.  The more taco stands, the merrier if you ask me.  Bring it tacos!",

    "text": "This is the kind of street food you'd find in any market or taqueria in Mexico...cheaper, chewier cuts of meats marinated and then seared on the flattop with onions. Simple and delicious. They were only offering the carne asada and ground beef ones today, so I'll have to go back for the tacos al pastor, which are my favorite. The salsa bar elevates this little taco stand above the rest, with a great choice of salsas, pico de gallo and thin guacamole. I don't know if they have them in order from hottest to mildest, but noticed the ones on the right were made from the more fiery chiles, so a note of caution for those of you who don't like too much heat.   The carniceria itself has a great selection of dried beans, canned goods, produce and dried chiles. The meat market is in the back, and, while I didn't buy anything today, I'll be returning to do some shopping. This Mexican market beats any others in Pittsburgh.   No seating here, but just on the other side of the fire station next door, there's a bench at the bus stop where we sat and devoured our tacos. Just like in Mexico City...  !Buen provecho!",

Las Palmas is just another great reason for you to go. I had two amazing tacos with a spicy pork and had the choice of a many different salsas and toppings. Las Palmas is a great little spot that everyone can come to and get taco'ed up and feel great., especially since each taco is $2.   You really only need 2 or 3.",

When we arrived I was nervous they didnt have anything for a \"veggie.\"   I asked the man what they had that was meatless and he had this potato pablano pepper mixture and so I decided to try that.  These tacos are legit!  I have been to Mexico a few times, and these are the real deal.  No cheese, and the spiciest, most flavorful salsas!  I was impressed!  He warned me that some of the salsas were really spicy, so those are the ones I tried, of course!  SO GOOD! MELT YOUR FACE OFF GOOD!  (Yes, I was actually sweating while eating!)  My only complaint is that by the time we got home my tortilla was a bit soggy from all the salsas I put on it.  I recommend using the little containers, if you have a long car ride.",

On any given day you can find your choice of meat in steak and onions, mixed meat (pork+chicken+beef), chorizo, chicken, mixed pork with pineapple. Everything is so so good and fresh but unfortunately you can stuff yourself with only two tacos or three if you are a serious eater, but two should pretty much fill you up. There is a separate stand for the different salsas and pico de gallo. Just one warning though, the salsas are hot and by hot I mean really hot. Being an Indian, I can pretty much handle any kind of heat but not the salsas at las palmas. You can skip the salsa and your taco will still taste great with the pico de gallo and generous squirts of lime. They have a busy oakland location too in atwood, but the brookline location is cleaner and more spacious.",

The food put out by Las Palmas is tacos the way they are done south of the border. If beef tongue is on the menu when you stop by, definitely go with that! It may sound weird to you, but trust me, try it once and you will gain an entirely new appreciation for beef.",

I quite frequently visit Reynas to get my fix, but I must say, this is the REAL DEAL.  The stand is located in the charming, yet unassuming business corridor of Brookline.   The Grocery itself looked packed with delcious mexican staples, which I will certainly have to return for when I am feeling more culinarily inspired.  The taco stand....does not dissapoint. They have a variety of meats to choose from, cooked and marinated on the spot similar to Reynas. The meat is good quality, soft, and tender.  what sets them apart is a cheaper price point (2 bills!!!!!! per taco), and myriad of toppings available. Go to town. Seriously delightful, still not heavily trafficked.   I will make this drive, and often.",

This place seemed legit, being a made-to-order stand outside the grocery store. You pick your meat, they warm it up on the flat top and serve it up on corn tortillas, then you add your own toppings.  We went for dinner. First, there's no menu, but you can sorta figure out what is what. Second, everything at the topping station is unlabeled. Third, there's little street lighting. Is this hot salsa? Guacamole? I'm not sure.  Like everyone says, the tacos are each $2.50. We tried the carnitas and chicken tacos. They were okay. A little dry but good flavor. However, the carnitas taco was FULL of gristle. Like, HUGE pieces of cartilage in my taco.  I'll be going somewhere else, and I suggest you do the same.",

I've been here on some brutally cold days and they are still open.  Love it. - There's nowhere to sit, and these are not tacos that you are easy to eat standing up.  I'd love it if they put on a couple folding chairs even.  The Market + Fabulous prices.  Ex: I found a pico de gallo that I enjoy for 60% less than the big chain grocery store. + The fresh tortillas. - The corn tortillas only came in tiny sizes.

It's corn tortillas grilled and filled with the meat of your choice.  Depending on when you go those meat choices vary but there is almost always a basic steak taco meat and ribeye.  They also have chicken, pork (my favorite), barbacoa, a potato/pepper vegetarian option, and chorizo.  It's your job to top them with the salsas, tomatoes, onions, and avocado they have waiting.

They have several options for meats or veggies to put on your taco and then a little place to put whatever you want on it. They have so many options and it all tastes great 5/5 stars for me.

Simple, inexpensive, fast and tasty!  I also like the big sidewalks and how close they are too the library and the ice cream shop.",

    "text": "Love the veggie tacos at Las Palmas. What a simple concept they have going; you pick the type of taco you want (meat or veggie), they give you the taco with just the base (meat or veggie), then you add as little or as much toppings as you want. The toppings bar has about 12 different options to choose from. There's several different salsas, fresh limes & cilantro, avocado and onions. With so many topping choices you can dress up each taco different. The veggie taco I ordered came with potatoes and grilled poblano peppers. They even put the tortilla wrap on the grill for a few seconds to warm it up and give it a little bit of a grilled taste. And the prices are great! Only $2.50 a taco!! And just 2 tacos will fill you up. If you're looking for True authentic tacos Las Palmas is definitely the way to go.",

Then I made an escape and while my henchbrethren waited, peering into the shadows from the safety of their car, I snagged a taco. Ah-hah!   I picked out the most colorful meat and said, my mouth full of drool, \"THAT one.\" It was a white meat, with an assortment of red and green vegetables and some string. CHEESE. I asked him what it was and he said, \"E__sc___a__,\" except more fluently and with more syllables. I couldn't understand it either. It turned out to simply be Chicken Fajita. At least that's what Customer A said.   The store is inside. Much goods there. Plus the salsas. Clustered around the salsa bar, were Customers A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J... You get the picture. There were a lot of women flocking to the taco stand.   And did the taco/fajita taste good? Absolutely. Best tacos in Pittsburgh I'm sure. I only wished that it wasn't my second brunch of the day so I could have tried more.",

I got a ribeye taco with sauteed onions, tomatoes, verde sauce and an incredible hot salsa. The way it's set up is you pick your meat and add your toppings separately. The tortilla is amazing and you can tell it's all house made. The tacos are incredibly cheap and soooo good!   The inside of the little store is adorable- they have a Mexican deli, produce, Mexican snacks and candy and they even have coke and other pop in glass bottles. Adorable.   This place is awesome and it's a must if you are in the Brookline or Oakland areas !",

Therefore, I was not surprised to find the tacos were as noted in most reviews ... simply wonderful. I chose one with pork and the other with steak and onion ... toppings were varied and delicious. My only regret is that I only bought two. The next time I will double my order. I sipped cold coconut juice from the store as the perfect accompaniment. I must confess that even though a couple of hours have passed, I have not yet brushed my teeth, I'm not ready to lose the faint aftertaste that is still teasing my palate. Go there!

I usually go hungry and purchase three, hand the man $6 and I am full and satisfied.   There is a self serve area for toppings, some toppings are onions, assortment of salsas (at least 3 kinds), guacamole, cilantro, lime, grilled peppers, spicy chili sauces (beware the brownish one is super hot).

Whereas most Mexican specialty stores have a lot of pre-packaged food and Mexican sourced kitchen and laundry items, Las Palmas is, although small, a full service grocery.  Not only do they stock dry and canned goods, but they also sell produce at reasonable prices and, as their name suggests, they have an excellent meat section selling Mexican cuts of beef, pork, and chicken as well as pre-seasoned taco and fajita meat.  The glory of Las Palmas doesn't stop with groceries, however.  Around lunch time, they open an on street taco stand that sells some of the best tacos in Pittsburgh along with an incredible salsa bar.  On weekends, they also sell homemade tamales that rival those sold in Mexico.  If you are craving authentic Mexican food, or just want to pick up some quick groceries, stop by Las Palmas Carniceria.",

Long Version: Having moved here recently from Southern California, seeing a Carniceria open down the street was an exciting prospect, but I expected to pay for that privilege. I was wrong: prices are as cheap, or in some cases (fresh bell peppers, some produce and butcher items) cheaper, as you'd find at Costco or Giant Eagle.   Plus, they have all the goodies you want like Coke bottled in Mexico (real sugar! no corn syrup), Jarritos Mexican soda, and a large assortment of those delicious and hard to find items you might associate with Mexican food or things available in Southern California. This includes pre-seasoned burrito and taco meats like Al Pastor for very cheap prices.  The only imperfect thing about the whole operation is that some items that are stocked are stocked in small numbers, so occasionally you'll go back to find they're out of stock of something you were looking for, but it'll usually be there next time you go back.  Highly Recommended",

I said it.  What to get: Rib Eye Taco, Rib Eye Taco, Rib Eye Taco. Why: Because I said so and I know things. Condiments?: Add your own. The salsa will kill you, be careful which ones you put on it. Try the milder ones, if there are any. Plus tons of onions and cilantro. What else: If they don't give me enough I yell \"Mas, Pal. Mas!\" And get dirty looks.   Madonna, \"Tacos De Las Palmas\"  Last night I dreamt of Las Palmas Just like I'd never gone, I ordered one A young guy with Ribeye on the grill It all seems like Mexico to me, not West PA  Tropical the Pittsburgh breeze No other tacos as good as these This is where I long to be Tacos De Las Palmas And when there's salsa on I get tingling in my tum It burns my bum and stings my eyes Your Mexican Ribeye  So when I say top 5 tacos in the United States please don't take it lightly. I've tried probably 2,000 taco places in this country (I'm not kidding) and plenty of those were the \"top rated\" places in one city or another. So I consider myself something of an expert. As much as someone who is not from Mexico can be. And si, I've been to Mexico a bunch too.Yo estoy enamorada con Las Palmas.  All the meats are good, some are great, but it's the Rib Eye that is a top 5 taco in the country. It's dramatically superior to any of the others at this stand, or the one in Oakland, or any other rival tacos for hundreds of miles. The next best nearest tacos are the Rib Eye at La Divina in Buffalo (not quite as good), and the Gordita (not really a taco) at Taco Nazo in Columbus.  Don't expect it to be like other street tacos you've had. Mexico is vast and has so many different regions which each have many different types of tacos and stands and shops and trucks, and there are so many different ways to do tacos. This place pre-prepares most of the meats en-masse and then dumps them on a large duo of corn tortillas (twice the size of the tacos you're used to, but still only 2 or 3 dollars), and puts nothing at all on them. Then you mosey over to the salsa bar, and add any one of about 10 different salsas and about 10 other different veggie-type condiments. Muy generoso!  People who don't like this Ribeye taco don't know what a Mexican Ribeye Taco is supposed to taste like. It's supposed to have this exact taste and texture... if you're very, very lucky.  Be warned. Most of the salsas will blow your head off. If they will blow my head off (and I can take it, believe me), then they may be too much for a lot of you. Ask them which ones are milder for a more gentle experience, both now and when you use the bathroom later.  The guys here are super sweet and doing a lot of work for little reward, so consider slipping them a tip which most Pittsburghese don't, I've noticed. Also consider popping into the Las Palmas Grocery Store, which is also wonderful, and probably should have a separate listing, so I can rave about the drinks and the trinkets and the meats and even the tamales they sometimes sell. Not to mention the soccer sticker albums. But since that would score a 5 too, I guess it's ok.  Don't miss the Ribeye Taco here, whatever you do.  Now I'm going to let Madonna finish this review.  Tropical the Pittsburgh breeze All the people Pittsburghese This is where I long to be Tacos De Las Palmas And when the salsa settled I'd run to the loo so fast It burns my bum and stings my eyes Your Mexican Ribeye",

I love the outdoor street cart style and at $2.50 each, you can get full off of 5 bucks! I've been going to Las Palmas Carniceria for years and it has never disappointed.",

    "text": "An outdoor taco stand is definitely not the place to go during the middle of snow showers, let alone deal with parking. The only advantage is that no one else was there! Located outside a Mexican grocery store the man who was running the stand spoke broken English and it was difficult to follow him. There was a lady inside but she couldn't help me either.  I did learn that he has 8 different types of fillings for your tacos. They cost $2.50 each so I settled for a grilled chicken and onion one. It is served in a soft shell and he put it in a styrofoam takeout container. He pointed out to me 8 different types of toppings and went over the ones that were hot and the ones that were mild rather quickly.  According to him there is no seating inside the grocery store but I'm not sure if you could take it in with you. I hurried back to my car to eat it. It was okay and messy as expected. It is nothing extraordinary about it. I somehow ended up with a hot spice so I was glad I had plenty of water in my car.  It would be nice if he had room inside the store for this stand on foul days but it is what it is. If you go I'd recommend you take someone who knows a bit of Spanish so you would be able to better comprehend what he is taking about. Due to time constraints I wasn't able to go inside the grocery store. Located at one of the intersections of Brookline Blvd pay meter parking is available.",

After your order, there is an array of toppings to put on.   Word of advice- if you're not sure, get it on the side because some are super spicy! They really fill up your taco and so I eat 2 and with the toppings, it's the perfect portion. If you're in the mood for something quick and delicious, this is your place.",

Being of Vietnamese descent, obviously I stand out a bit in a line of predominantly Mexican and Caucasian customers looking to buy tacos from their outdoor cart. They make it a point to bring it up EVERY god damn time I am there. Talking in spanish (which they do not know I can understand having grew up in Atlantic City, a cultural hub full of ethnicities. Having some very good friends of Dominican, Puertorican, Mexican, and Venezuelan descent and taken up to level 4 advanced spanish in High school) about how this \"chino\" really likes tacos and that its such a spectacle. And I know they're not just flattered that a non-Mexican likes tacos, they just think the concept is funny and amusing to them. And once, they had the nerve to make remarks like \"ching chong\" to my face, expecting me to find it funny.   Regardless, despite the rude and insulting service, they still get a 3 because their tacos are amazing, along with their salsa bar. But god damn, have some class.",

You can make a meal out of it with two or three tacos. I like going to Chipotle but this place has way better tacos and for a cheaper price. There is just no comparison. After getting your tacos, there is a salsa bar which you can pick what you want to put in your tacos.   There is also a little Hispanic grocery store. They have a variety of meat and veggies. I like buying the pre-mixed meats which you can just throw it in a frying pan and cook it very easily.  I highly recommend getting the tacos from this place! Only down side is that there is no place to sit and enjoy.",

The variety of toppings and salsa which are placed inside the store comes in mild and hot option. The hot.. trust me .. are really hot :) but very flavorful as well. I think the hot toppings went really with the pineapple chicken balancing the sweetness and the spicy hotness of the sauce. The meat were well seasoned and cook to perfection.

This place is constantly featured on Pittsburgh's Best lists and for good reason- you can't beat the authenticity and value of Las Palmas. Each taco is $2.50 and you order the quantity of tacos inside at the grocery cash register.  I come here more frequently than I'd like to admit and they serve different proteins daily but they always (Ok, every day that I've gone) have a beef/steak and a chicken option. Sometimes they have chorizo, definitely a winner. My favorite parts, though, are the corn tortillas and the toppings options (lots of different salsas, etc to put on your taco).   Las Palmas' tacos are a great to-go option. There are no designated tables and seats (it is a taco stand after all) but there are benches along Brookline Blvd so you can immediately indulge if you'd like.  The guys here are so nice. My spanish is rudimentary but I order in spanish and they help me along. It makes my day.   Parking - if you've never been to Brookline there is ample pull-in street parking (metered, though, but the meters take coins or the app) and there are also parallel spots available on the opposite side of the Blvd from Las Palmas. Las Palmas is located right near another Brookline gem- Pitaland- so once you're done with your tacos, stop in there for some hummus to take home!",

Plus the corn tortillas.  So fresh.  Squeezed some lime on top.  Fantastic.  One was chorizo.  It was a little heavier than I would have preferred (i.e., greasy) but I guess I kind-of asked for it.  I topped that with the avocado sauce.  It helped cool the spicy chorizo (and my still burning mouth).  Added more lime.  I would like to buy a chorizo and make it with eggs the next morning.

    "text": "While nearby and looking for a quick meal, I stopped by the outdoor taco stand to pick up a few tacos to go. Despite the chilly weather, there was a line for the tacos. As I waited, I watched the tacos being made. The meats are precooked and kept warm. When you order, the corn soft shells are heated and the meat of your choice is added. When I asked the options, I struggled to understand what was communicated to me so I simply asked for 2 pork, 2 ground beef and 2 chicken. However, there were about 6 options including what I believed to be steak and a fajita mix. I then went inside to the toppings bar and added what I believed to be Pico de Gallo and a creamy guacamole, unfortunately nothing was labeled. I tried to ask a few questions to the cashier but she had some difficulty understanding me. Seems they could really benefit from a few posted signs with the meat options, prices and toppings. I took the tacos to go and shared them with my family. Overall, I felt the taste was authentic though the meat was a bit fatty for me. I also felt it lacked some overall flavor. For $2.50 a taco, it was a great deal but I would not go out of my way to return.",

I knew the food was going to be a treat was when we discovered we were the only English speaking people at the taco stand!  Everyone else was speaking Spanish and we were the foreigners!  The owners were very nice and explained the different meats they are cooking. It was wonderful that I was able to select myself was toppings (dozen to chose from!) to put on. Next time we are bring two chairs and a table to make it a five star experience.",

Tacos are cheap, authentic, and you get to doctor them up yourself with whatever salsas and toppings your heart desires. So far, I rate these as the most authentic Mexican tacos in the Pittsburgh area that I've come across. Note that as this isn't actually a restaurant, you'll have to stand around outside to eat them, but that's part of the experience. Also, if you're afraid of spice, avoid the orange (habanero?) salsa at all cost - it'll knock you flat on your back!",

There is an assortment of condiments to put onto your taco, all of which you apply yourself.    Multiple types of meat, and a vegetarian potato poblano choice as well.

The owners are great, make sure you let them know of anything needed (I have asked for tapas de empanadas); most of the items they carry are Mexican style foods and other Latin American countries.  They also have marinated fajita meat (beef, pork and chicken) spicy but not too much. Last time I went in there they were roasting a pork, my husband said it was delicious! One new thing I noticed is chicken milanesa, one more thing to try, very easy to cook and the pieces are big!  I'm glad we have the this butcher in town. My family is very happy. And I support local stores!!",

They are not that great, they don't make them on the spot like I am used to but at least you don't have to worry about your taco falling apart. Everything else is amazing, the meat, salsa, all the choices you have to fill your taco with. I hope they stay there forever.",

    "text": "This is the real deal, folks. Plenty of Mexican specialties, brands, sauces, seasonings, candies, etc. I stepped inside this place and was whisked away in a moment to a cluttered, darkly lit carniceria loudly blasting a duel between the Spanish broadcast of a Manchester United game and norteno horns and vocals. Its magical.  This place is a bit smaller than the carnicerias I'm used to in Arizona. But for a gem like this to be found in Brookline is almost unreal. There's several aisles worth of groceries. Here you will find Mexican cookies, candies, sauces, marinades, spices, seasonings, canned goods, etc. Dare to be different, grab something and try it. I managed to nab some salsa verde, carne asada seasoning, horchata mixand these little red/white/green coconut candies my daughter fell in love with. There's a cold case with plenty of beverages, chorizo, eggs, queso, etc. You bet your sweet bippy I grabbed several Jaritos. Pina is my favorite.  There's a small produce area with most of the veggies you'd see at any grocery store here. The only thing I noticed different was the napoles. That and there were literally pounds and pounds of fresh jalepenos. Not the typical half-ass, wilted, dying display you see at most grocery stores here in town.  The butcher's counter is where its at, though. They had about a dozen and a half different cuts of meat. Among those, there were about a half-dozen varieties of marinated pork. No carne asada, which was a bit disappointing. They did have the meat, though. And the guy behind the counter told me what seasoning to buy. Also back here, I found lots of spices, tons of different tortillas (corn, fried, corn, flour), and huge bins filled with dried chilis. They also had these pizza sized chicharones I wanted to grab.  There's a small bakery area with about a dozen different cookies, pastries and buns. Plus they have a large rack of Bimbo products. I got a big three colored triangle cookie for my daughter that tasted like tamarind, vanilla and cinnamon. She loved it. I also bought a package of tortillas. Not the tiny blinding-white tortillas that are flavorless, chewy and almost inedible. No...these tasty hub-cab sized, floury disks of tortilla love. The kind that you can actually build a burrito out of.  All in all, I spent about 20 bucks on various groceries and delicacies. I made burritos all weekend long. I bought a bunch of dried red chilis that I plan on turning into hot sauce. I also plan on coming back next week for another shipment.  They sell street tacos outside, too. They're expensive, $2.00 apiece instead of $.50 apiece. And there's not much of a selection, just carne asada, chorizo and carnitas. But they're tasty and full of meat, probably a quarter pound in each. No cheese on the tacos but there is a salsa bar with about a dozen sauces, plus onions, cilantro, limes, etc. Its pretty rad. Rad enough, for a few moments, to make me pretend I'm back home in America munching on tacos in the sunshine instead of this dump of a city. I'll be coming back often!",

They're really straightforward, cheap tacos ($2.50/ea) with doubled up corn tortillas. There is a condiments station with every type of sauce you would want and 3-4 salsas on top of that.  There's one super spicy salsa that's deep red with a bunch of pepper seeds in it. When I went to scoop some onto my taco the man behind the flattop warned me \"very spicy\". And he was right!  They have a huge variety of meats too, I've tried lengua, goat, chorizo, and carnitas. I was really surprised to find goat and lengua (beef tongue), and they are really good! I highly recommend them.  This is my favorite taco spot, I'd give it 6 stars if I could.",

So I did the outdoor taco stand thing, and got 3 tacos to go. They have a toppings bar at the end of the line but it was not very well stocked - the cilantro was gone.

Two tacos is plenty for me - so an inexpensive dinner that is fantastic is worth the drive!  Make the trip Pittsburghers!",

Another Pittsburgh place to eat at crossed off the list.   I like the concept too - it's slightly upmarket street-food. So basically it's like there is a grocery store and then in front of this store is this guy who has set up a stall with his portable stove top and a bar for toppings on the side. There are like 6-7 toppings (and yes vegetarians get love too) and the whole deal cost you $2.50 per taco.  While the rest of the group was in line, I went inside the colourful store (love the pinatas hanging from the ceiling) and purchased x4 Mexican Guavas for .50 cents!! They also sell both varieties of cactus too if you want to try those out.   Anyway after my purchase, I got back in line and tried the chicken, the chorizo, the veggie and the amazing Barbacoa which was my fave. The array of toppings was also awesome but since there is no description- I ended up getting a pretty hot salsa inadvertently and luckily there was a avacado sauce available, which helped bring the heat level down. The veggie was also delicious- I wasn't a fan of the chorizo - found it too dry- but the chicken was decent.   Absolutely great place and very happy I had the chance to try it out!

The past couple of times I went to get some WIC stuff (milk, eggs, cheese...basic stuff), they started telling me I couldn't get them bc of the \"brand\", when in fact I got the exact same things like two weeks prior without an issue. Then about a week ago when I went, (two separate trips bc I forgot something and had to use another WIC check), they let a line of like 10 people ahead of me and I'm pretty sure it was bc of WIC. Finally, the straw that broke my back today was when I went to go check out with my WIC stuff (milk for the baby's  bottle), they told me that they weren't accepting WIC debit cards (which I knew), but they weren't even accepting the checks like at all. AND THEY ASKED ME TO PUT THE STUFF BACK AFTER EMBARRASSING ME! LAS PALMAS IGA has lost any and all of my business.  If I could give no stars I would.",

Staff is friendly. Been shopping for mexican groceries and such for about 6 months.   Now, this is the sad part of the review for me... The main produce chiller was not working today. But, worse, today... my wife and I saw a 2\" roach on the checkout counter, crawling over our grocery basket! The cashier told my wife and I that this was the first roach she's seen. She chased it under the counter with a basket divider. But, my understanding is that when you see one, there are many, many more you don't see...  After seeing the roach, I was kind of in shock, and bought our groceries anyway, but my partner cleaned off every item we got with alcohol and put our grocery bags in the wash... Sorry to write this review, because they are a good community resource. I hope they do something soon to clear the place of vermin. I'm not sure if we'll go back until we hear they have done so. :(",

Located right in front of a Mexican grocery store, you have to go inside and pay for the tacos ($2.50 each) and come out to order the meat you like.  These guys are so generous with their portions of meat.  All the thumbs up in the world for their beef cheeks taco.  Al pastor was great too (the mild hint of pineapple!  Gahhhh, I usually hate pineapple but it integrated so well together).  Looking forward to trying their lengua taco next time.  Did I mention the sauce/topping bar?  Yea, go crazy.    This is such a gem and only 10 minutes from downtown.  Thank you for providing us with the real deal!  Gracias!!!",

You can choose either flour or corn tortillas -- the flour will take a little longer than the corn -- for your taco and a filling of beef, pork, or sausage.  The taco by itself is nothing special.  The seasonings are rather bland and the tortillas are not homemade.  What really makes these tacos good are the condiments and sauces that are in the cart to the left of the grill.  These sauces are freshly made and wow do they taste good on the tacos.  Be careful, though, I have no discernible heat tolerance limit and so was scooping on the sauces and trying them with a spoon.  Some poor guy after me apparently took some of the habanero sauce after me and his eyes were gushing with tears.    Hurts so good!",

I seem to find myself there most Saturdays (it helps that there is a bakery right next door and a pita, etc. store two doors up!).    At $2 a taco you really can't go wrong!  And the do-it-yourself salsa topping bar is just really great.  You're always sure to get your taco topped just the way you want it.  It allows you to experiment with the different salsas as well.  The tacos are filled quite generously with your choice of meats or potato, etc.  I find that one taco is not quite enough but that two really fill me up.    I've never ventured inside the store but am always tempted.  Now that I actually feed the meter (one too many parking tickets!), I will definitely make it a point to go inside the store on my next trip.  The Jarritos drinks are sold outside during the summer and are the perfect beverage to wash down your tacos.  This taco stand is really a must for everyone!  It's authentic Mexican food, not that crappy Taco Bell stuff.  Yummy!",

It's just a stand outside where they cook everything and then there is an area with toppings off to the side--so many delicious salsas, some very spicy, some not so much, their pico de gallo is phenomenal as well as their avocado sauce. Most recently when I went I got 2 steak tacos. It's grilled steak, unsure of whether it was marinated or not, with onions in it and it was seriously great. They had a few other meat options besides just chicken and steak.. They have a ground beef, another steak option I believe, some type of spicy sausage (maybe?) can't be 100% sure because I haven't had anything else yet, but I can not wait to try more! There is also a store, the taco stand is just out front. Inside the store they have some pretty neat items as well, although I didn't get to look around as much as I wanted to.

Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I love sour cream and cheese with my tacos and that's not an option! We will definitely be back.",

I wished that I hadn't.  Two bites into the chewy, low grade cut of ribeye my stomach started to rumble.  That was all I ate of that.  Not sure if it was the meet or the salsa but something didnt feel good in my belly.  I will *not* be ordering tacos from here again.  The grocery is another story altogether.  I come from an area with a huge Latin and international population.  We have many Spanish grocery stores. None as well-stocked as this one.  I would definitely come back here to shop!",

The taco's are delicious. i have to say that the secret to their success is the home made taco shells that are beyond authentic. That combined with a pretty awesome salsa bar that could make just about anything taste good.   So the meat is just alright but like I said it's the soft tacos and salsa's that you go for.

We also went into the store to get tortilla chips and salsa that you can buy homemade from the butcher counter.  Side note - the butcher counter looked amazing and I definitely need to go back to get some fajita fixings.  But I digress...  the tacos!  The tacos are on fresh soft shells.  Corn and deliciousness in your hand. At the end of the grill, there is a wondrous stand for salsas.  It is filled to the brim with the good stuff - pico de gallo, cilantro, limes, pureed avocado, tomatillo salsa, red salsa...  All spectacular.  I am never one that loves pico de gallo, but this was amazing.    Definitely the best tacos in the city and for $2 a taco - they really can't be missed.  Come to Brookline and fall in love!",

Service is casual and friendly; however, since these tacos are best when ate immediately after preparation, you may end up eating outside or in your car.

In search of good Mexican while in Pittshburgh. Las Palmas name kept coming up in various web searches. It was late, we were hungry, and we chose Brookline as the destination.   Upon arrival, I saw the store. Understand first however that I was under the assumption that there was a full restaurant on premises (because I did not fully read or understand the reviews here, duh!) So we go in, and WOW what an awesome market! I feel like I am in Mexico. I look around, go to the back. I ask the guy at the meat counter \"where is the restaurant?\" He says \"there is no restaurant but we got tacos around the corner\"... OK, off we go. I was expecting a little enclosed area, like a walk up clam bar of sorts. When we turned the corner there was nothing like that. It was just a tent with a guy working a flat top and a condiment stand. Hmmm, ok, lets go for it! The smell was amazing, the smoky grilled meat goodness pulled me in.  Hello, TWO DOLLAR TACO!!! I have never experienced a True street taco stand. This, is authentic as you can get, outside of Mexico in the northeast, I presume. Grilled corn tortillas with any meat you desire (pollo, puerco, lomo, asada, etc.) And all the toppings you desire as well. If you want it mild or of you want to burn your face off, it is all there for the fixin'...   A real rib eye taco for TWO DOLLARS?? I repeat... TWO DOLLARS??!! All the meats come from the butchery inside so I knew it would be good because I examined the whole meat case and all the cuts were top quality and above all, FRESH.   I started with two tacos then got another even though I was full because it was just THAT GOOD. Imagine that... THREE tacos stuffed with whatever you want, SIX DOLLARS!   We traveled across town twice in 2 days to stuff our faces with these tacos until our lips burned off :)  When leaving the city we went BACK to the store to take home a nice booty of authentic Mexican groceries - if I had a cooler with me I would have taken meats home too, because no where at home here could I find such quality and prices of meats like at this little store.  I would drive over 3 hours once again to gorge on tacos and stock up on goods from this store. I will bring a cooler next time!!  PS: I found some desserts in the cooler inside - I chose the choco cheese flan - HOLY WOW it was the most delicious flan I have EVER had.  This is truly a hidden gem in P'burgh. YINZ NEEDS TO GET THERE AND EXPERIENCE IT!!!",

I'm normally not even a taco fan, but they take it to a completely different level, every savory bite is a transformative flavor experience.  Here is Las Palmas by the numbers:  1 other mexican restaurant's all-mexican staff that told me Las Palmas is where THEY all go out to eat  2 dollars is the price of each taco.  Each taco is actually wrapped with 2 hand made soft taco tortillas and have a double portion of meat (potato salad is an option for vegetarians), so it's more like 1 dollar per standard size taco.  Gourmet, fresh, delicious mexican at cheaper than taco bell prices!  4 is how many tacos I ate.  I ordered 2, left, ate them, and immediately returned to buy more to go to bring home for dinner that night!  10 is how many different fresh toppings they have, guacamole, peppers, limes, cilantro, onions and a variety of salsas from mild to absolutely DEADLY hot habaneros!  7 is how many days a week I'd happily eat Las Palmas tacos!",

    "text": "So I'm not a local, but we were walking around Brookline and stumbled across the taco stand outside Las Palmas. Not sure if this is an everyday, but it's at least there on Sundays. It's a simple operation: one guy manning a griddle to heat up tortillas with a selection of meats and a condiment bar. I only tried the chorizo, but it was pretty good. I added salsa Verde, cilantro, and pickled red onion to make a pretty yummy taco. I wasn't in love with the tortillas... They almost seen doubled up, but they're just too thick and dominated the flavor a bit. Otherwise, a great spot to grab some pretty authentic street tacos.",

Grilled right outside rain or shine and there's always a line (sometimes longer than others) so you know it's well loved! The salsa bar is also official, just watch out for the orange habanero salsa, yikes!",

Barbacoa's always available, though, and it's almost as good.  Tip: Just found out today that you can pay for tacos inside with a credit card if you're low on cash.  (They'll mark it on your receipt to show outside.)",

Great tortillas by the way. Eat a toreado if you're brave!    This is a real taco stand, so be prepared to stand or take it para llevar.   The grocery is also incredible and a value. Stock up on avocados and limes. Order a thick cut lomo for the grill, you won't regret it.",

I had one chicken and one steak and my husband had the pork - all were amazing. Warning though, the hot salsa is for sure HOT! I'm not one for super spicy but my husband added it to his and for sure said it lived it to the hot label. Can't wait to go back!",

Is it better than Reyna's Tacos (Strip)? Does it matter? Not really because depending on what part of town myself in I would take either.  You know how taco stands work right? Pick your meat carnitas, chicken, or steak. Then choose your veggies. Simple right? Yes Simple! I like the one in Oakland too.",

    "text": "I love Mexican food. If I could eat it all day every day, I probably would. Pittsburgh unfortunately does not have a huge Mexican food scene, but most of the places are very good.  This place is simply delicious. I moved to the city from the country last summer, and this was one of the first places my boyfriend took me on a \"date\" to. He knows my love for Mexican and he knows all the hidden gems around the city. They only have tacos here, but they are done perfectly.  I was a little weary about eating tacos from a cart on the street, but those fears were immediately subdued when I took my first bite. We took our tacos to my car and ate them off sitting off the truck on my car since it was a nice day out. Coke in glass bottles for drinks! The tacos were super delicious and unlike any other taco I have ever had. Really fresh and seasoned perfectly. The 2 tacos were really filling surprisingly! They have a bunch of fresh toppings for your tacos so you can customize however you want.  I will be back to this spot for sure!",

Taco Stand: I don't think you can get a better taco in the city - authentic - pick your preferred meat (or potato & pepper veg option) and load it up with all the condiments that you could want - best part - $2 a taco - its hard to justify cooking when the food is that good and that cheap!  Market: I love this little place - fresh produce, meat, and other items all in this little place. Need something quick, just run in and grab it. I have used it more than half a dozen times for quick needs or when I need authentic ingredients and don't want to hunt all over town for them.   I will be back over and over again....",

Fill up your to go mitts with fresh pico, cilantro, guac and all of the delicious salsas that your body craves and you'll be set for hours. Remember, cash only at the taco stand, muy importante!",
