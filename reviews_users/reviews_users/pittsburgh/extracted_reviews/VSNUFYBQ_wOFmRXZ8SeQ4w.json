    "text": "Such a simple little Polish deli but so good. We stumbled upon this place while exploring the Strip District and are thankful we did.  I ordered the six pierogies, as an assortment, so we could try the various fillings. What arrived were six of the same (which was fine - they were absolutely delightful!) -- kraut and mushroom, with a cup of creamy thick sour cream. The melted butter and extra kraut on top made for a perfect dish. We also had the cabbage roll which was full of flavor.  Prices are on point and the food felt authentic. There's not much in terms of ambiance but we enjoyed our experience for a light lunch.",

I haven't had a real pierogi in ages and these certainly did not disappoint. SO good and swimming in a little pool of butter. They had several other items I wanted to eat (the vegetarian platter) but I had to restrain myself since I would be eating dinner again in 3 hours.... Anyhow, if you are in Pittsburgh & in the mood for a pierogi (if you're not in the mood you should be! get on these pierogis asap!) definitely swing by this place. Not too pricey, cash only if your bill is less than $10. 4 pierogis for $4. So.Good!",

Looking at the many european goodies around the store, I was excited to try the food, located in the rear of the store. I can't say that I'm a pierogi connoisseur, but given the huge variety of salty and sweet kinds they had, I tried quite a few of them and liked them all! i haven't tried or seen sweet pierogies anywhere else, so seeing the strawberry one that i ordered, topped with sour cream, I was pleasantly surprised by how well it concluded my meal.  besides the slightly slow wait (which is understandable due to the small staff), i'll definitely be back!",

We enjoyed a couple of them at the deli and packed up the rest to take home.  This class was a ton of fun, especially with a group of us, or even your significant other.  I recommend attending a class with Dorota as your instructor - she and Slawomir are awesome.   I look forward to the next series of classes offered.  This was well worth the time and money.",

    "text": "We were visiting my wife's family in Western Penn last June, and she was emphatic that we could not visit Pittsburgh without eating pierogis at least once.  Now, I'm down with anything doughy in general, and I'd been a fan of pierogis since discovering them in Ukrainian diners in New York.  I did some research on the Pittsburgh version, and on the first day we went to Penn Brewery and had an order of the pan fried ones there.  They were very good.  My wife was pleased.  The second day we happened to be wandering around The Strip and I mentioned that another Pierogi place I'd read about was close by.  That would be S&D, and we wandered down Penn until we found it.    Now, I'm just going to tell you right off that they only lose a star because of ambiance.  I'll get to the food in a moment, but the place itself is something like a Polish convenience store.  Maybe they do most of their trade in wholesale, I don't know, but the place itself is sort of austere.  You order at a window and then wait at a table under really bright fluorescent lighting until they call your order.  I like atmosphere; that's not what S & D offers.  Staff are professional and that's about it.  All that to say, when we got our pierogis, they blew my mind.  One order of the potato-cheese and one order of the mushroom-kraut.  Just steamed.  Like I said, I've had many pierogi experiences, but what I realized after my first bite of an S & D one was that all the previous ones had been, basically, very pleasant sour cream/apple sauce delivery devices.  Just as these were, steamed with a splash of butter and kraut, they were incredible.  The best I've ever had, and my wife would say the same.  When I finally got around to writing this review, I noticed the other review below, the one claiming that S & D is importing their pierogis and not making them in house.  Look, I don't want to get in the middle of any Pittsburgh pierogi war - but that is difficult to reconcile with what I experienced.  Though not from these parts, I'm an avid eater and cook, and I feel reasonably confident that I would have noticed the evidence of that.  I encourage you to try it and judge for yourself.",

This got us in to the store and after seeing all of the delicious deli items (including a nut roll that looks amazing) I can't wait to go back for lunch. They are looking to expand and add other classes but I recommend the pierogi making one. It was well organized and the 2 instructors (Polish of course) were fantastic!  They gave us a simple to use recipe and careful instructions.  We watched as they prepared the filling and dough and then were able to roll out our own pierogis.  We then boiled them in a pot (my only complaint is that were ran out of time at the end of the class to cook them for the right time) and take a dozen home with us!  They were absolutely delicious and of course the butter/onion topping was a great touch.",

The store itself is like a deli/corner grocery store rather than a restaurant. There were only 2 tables for seating so either the lines are super long or you have to get them perogies to go!   It's cash-only which is a no-no in my book. The dishes behind the glass counter didn't look or smell all that appealing to me. I split a beef perogie meal with my hubby and the taste was okay, not bad. They are like European dumplings, so if you have never had a real dumpling before, then I guess this is fine but I'm a dumpling/bao zi/dim sum connoisseur so perogies just pale in comparison. The wrapper is kind of hard and thick and the filling is very bland. I did, however, very much enjoy the onion butter black pepper sauce on top. That was lip-smackingly good. The haluski pasta side was also buttery, smooth and delicious.   Kind of expensive for the small amount of food you get. Good for a little snack but does not quite do it for me for an entree.",

On Monday I went back to The Strip to pick some up at the deli to bring back to Florida. I was shocked to learn that they aren't made there. They are actually made in Chicago. Ironic huh?  They do have a nice deli counter and helpful staff.  But get your pierogis somewhere else (church) if you want something authentic from Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "I always hate when I go to a place that has a zillion 5 star reviews and find my experience underwhelming. I always wonder if I caught them on a bad day or if there's something wrong with me. Sadly, I found my lunch at S&D Polish Deli to be one of these \"everybody else loves it but I thought it was ehhh\" experiences.  I went for lunch a couple of Mondays ago, eager to try their pierogies that I've heard so much about. I went around 1pm, and it was packed (huge line), but they took orders quickly. I ordered potato pancakes, haluski, and potato and cheddar pierogies....only to be told that they ran out of potato and cheddar and only had farmer's cheese or mushroom pierogies. Not being a fan of those flavors, I passed on the pierogies altogether, which was hugely disappointing. The annoying thing was that they had a ton of potato and cheddar pierogies for sale in their frozen case that I could plainly see. I was tempted just to buy some and ask them to cook them up for me. I mean, I don't know why they couldn't just take some of the ones they have for sale and use those, but I guess they had their reasons. So right off of the bat, I was super disappointed...I would think that a place specializing in pieorgies should not run out of one of their most basic flavors so early into their lunch service.  So just potato pancakes and haluski it was. I placed my order, got a number, and sat down to wait. I'm not an impatient person, and I understand that restaurants get busy during lunch time. But it took over 30 mins to get my food. Over 30 mins...for a few potato pancakes and some haluski! I don't know if this is typical or not, but at a deli-style takeout place, I was hoping to get my food a little sooner.  Anyway, the food finally came, and I couldn't wait to dig in. Sadly, it was not worth the wait. The potato pancakes were borderline burnt on the bottom, which gave them an unpleasant charred taste. Worse than that, I felt like I basically received a plate of oil with a side of potato pancake. Seriously, these things were swimming in grease....when I would press down on a pancake to cut it, the oil from within the pancake bubbled up to the surface. I understand the pancakes are fried, so obviously a little oil is expected, but these things tasted like nothing but burnt grease. I ate one and it immediately sat in my stomach like a lead balloon, so I had to trash the other two. The haluski was a little better, but nothing notable...no better or worse than haluski I've had elsewhere.  So overall from the lack of cheddar pierogies, to the long wait for food, to the grease-laden bombs that are their potato pancakes, I have to say that I was not too impressed by S&D. That being said, because of their stellar reputation and my love of pierogies, I do plan to go back and hopefully catch them on a day when they have the cheddar flavor in stock to see if I have a better experience. I'll update this review once I'm able to get my paws on some pierogies!",

I was told by a friend that the best pierogies are sold at churches. While that may remain True for some folks, I found that S&D's are pretty damn good!! My mouth is literally watering right now thinking of their food.  We frequent the store every Sunday after church to get our \"snacks\" and this generally means we split the Polish platter for $11 which includes haluszki, 1 stuffed cabbage, and 3 different pierogi. This can't be good for us! (I kid!)  The haluszki is very soft pasta but not mushy seasoned with butter, pepper, onions. I don't know what it is about it that makes it so wonderfully delicious? But it is and it's totally worth trying!  The stuffed cabbage is also a favorite of mine. The cabbage is tender enough to cut through with a fork. I don't know what the meat is but it's covered in a tomato sauce. Also very delicious.  Lastly the pierogi in the Pierogi Platter comes with 3 pieces. Each with different filling: potatoes and cheese, a white cheese, and meat with sauerkraut. The dough is always cooked perfectly not hard edges. Flavored with butter and finely minced onions. How can something so simply made taste so good!!   I love this place and I love that each Sunday we have our little tradition at S & D.   It's mainly a Polish market. They also have specials for the day located near the cashiers station.",

Equal parts lunch counter, grocery store, and gift shop, S&D will remind you of a Polish heritage you may not even know you had.   The lunch counter has a wide range of Polish specials, ranging from Pittsburgh's favorite pierogi in a variety of flavors, to soups and stews such as bigos. The Polish platter is my favorite when I want a big lunch. It's a full plate loaded with goabki (stuffed cabbage), pierogi, and a heaping helping of haluszki. All of it tastes authentic and made with care. You'll get served quickly, but a meal like this is best eaten slow, both to enjoy the flavor and to make sure you don't burst.  The grocery portion of the store features most of the items at the lunch counter to go, as well as a selection of fresh and smoked sausages, Polish cheeses, homemade sauerkraut, and more. A wide variety of packaged foods and snacks imported from Poland are available as well. In addition, there are all sorts of clothes, hats, mugs, and flags for sale so you and all your friends can show off your Polish pride. Even when not eating here, it's fun to browse the store, and I just know I'll give in and buy a hat one of these days.  S&D Polish Deli is the spot for Polish food, whether you want to make it yourself or have it done for you. Raise a glass and say, \"Na zdrowie!\" to S&D!",

    "text": "My in-laws were visiting for dinner from out of town and I wanted to treat them to pierogi since I'm Polish and pierogi are associated with Pittsburgh! I was so excited to stop by S&D to take some pierogi home to prepre later.   You can order all sorts of prepared pierogi from the window inside S&D but I opted to get some pierogi to make later from the refrigerator. These pierogi are all made fresh daily in-house. They had regular cheese/potato flavors but also fun and unique flavors like plum! I opted for a few cheddar and a few farmers cheese. The preparation instructions are on their website if you don't know how to cook them!  The girl behind the counter helped me pick out the kinds and quantity of kielbasa I should get. She took her time explaining all the different kinds since I didn't know what I was looking for (never seen so much kielbasa in my life!)   In the end my in-laws were obsessed with the meal and not one bite was leftover. Thank you S&D!!!",

Tasted like a Mac n cheese potato dumpling! What more could you ask for. Seating can be limited depending what time you go but seats open up at you wait for your food. They offer the pierogis to be fired for an extra $1 but we got the cooked ones and they come in like a cheesy milky buttery sauce. Not sure exactly what the sauce is but it's delicious with the pierogis. If you're in the area I would definitely recommend these as a snack!",

This time I purchased potato cheese pierogies, which were regularly $11 for one dozen but were on sale for $7.70 because of the expiration date; a dozen frozen pierogies for $9; borscht for $8.50 per quart; haluszki for $8 per quart; and a dozen of kolaczki apricot cookies for $10 each. The fresh borscht was *just broth* (!), although the frozen borscht contained dumplings. Based on the ingredients, I definitely overpaid for the fresh borscht and haluszki. I am willing to continue to buy the pierogies and kolaczki because they make them better than I do.",

After stuffing our faces with a couple of sandwiches, my friend wasn't sure if we could eat here. I let him know it wouldn't be a problem for me.   Everything was delicious and I left more than satisfied. This seems like a wonderful option for a cheap lunch in Pittsburgh.",

Servings are quite large and totally shareable, especially stuff like the Pierogi Platter, Potato Pancakes.  Best to bring a friend in tow, get a coupla things to share!  Out of the 3 different kinds of pierogis on the platter (krautmush, cheddar/potato, & farmer's cheese), my fav was the cheddar/potato.  Dumplings themselves were quite large and obviously handmade.    Potato Pancakes were quite large, thick, and primarily crunchy.  So again, they were quite heavy, definitely more than 1 serving.    Works out to be ~$1/pierogi, so best value again is to share.",

While you are ordering lunch and waiting, you can pick up any meats or Polish delicacies you could want for dinner!  They also have frozen pierogies that you can take home and heat up for dinner!  I came in a week or so ago, and I ordered the spinach and cheese pierogies, which was the daily special.  For only $4, I got 4 pockets of joy.  The butter sauce was delicious.  The inside was 98% spinach and 2% cheese so I would only order these as a spinach lover.  The filling was fantastic, and there was a plethora of it.  I really want to try the farmer's cheese and potato cheddar ones now too.  The employees are very friendly, and I look forward to returning soon!",

I stop in here often, and no matter what I get, it is always great food.    To be honest, I would have never tried the place if it weren't for an international exchange student that stayed with us a few years ago. He was from Russia and researched the place so we tried it since we hit the strip regularly.  I am sooooooo glad he brought us here, this place is authentic and you won't be disappointed if you eat here, or if you take it home and prepare it yourself.

However, once I've tried it, it wasn't bryndza at all, but what it tastes like to me feta mixed with cream cheese. I could have made that myself and it would most definitely cost me less $7 per .60lb.  The site should have either mention that it isn't authentic bryndza or call it something else, as it's very deceiving for someone who knows what bryndza should taste like.   It's disappointing as I was looking forward oh having some True taste of home. Definitely won't be ordering more items. :(",

But the flavors I had were:  Regular potato and onion Cheddar and onion Beef and sauerkraut Cheese  They were boiled, not fried, and fell apart in your mouth. Delicious and tasteful, I ate 4 by myself in like 2 minutes. Only knock is there weren't available more flavors. Next time I'll come early!",

    "text": "This place is wonderful, and--in my opinion--puts so many things I love about Pittsburgh into one tiny location. The ethnic pride. The chaos. The friendliness. The great food.  I'm half Polish, though I didn't really grow up eating too much Polish food (or, at least, too much authentic Polish food). My wife and I stopped at a killer, real-deal Polish restaurant in Montreal a few years ago, though, and that started my quest for amazing Polish food. Which quickly led us to S&D in the Strip.   It's a pretty narrow place, and it always seems packed (even on weekdays). The space is pretty evenly divided between retail, deli, and a small dining space. You can order food and eat it, and boy is it good. I've tried about four different dishes there, all incredible. (Personal recommendation: the pork stew on dumplings is tops. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!) This is all authentic stuff, folks, and, the folks in the tiny kitchen whip it up quickly. There's limited space to eat, though, and even then the tables are wobbly and kind of gross. This might be the only qualm I have with the place, and it's really a minor one.  There're a lot of Polish and Eastern European household goods jammed into the back of the shop, too--everything from teas to pottery to chocolate to frozen pierogi. Lots of kitschy \"Kiss Me, I'm Polish\"-style shirts adorn the walls, of course, but they also have some lovely glassware and the like. Some of the imported goods are wonderful, too. I picked up a box of Herbapol mint tea once on a whim and now I'll never touch drink anything else.  The good folks there--all family, I think--are super friendly, switch back and forth between English and Polish for effect. There's always a huge link snaking past the deli meat and cheese display, and customers are always so good-natured. I love it, and I love this place. Hope you will too!",

    "text": "I stopped by here today with my father for lunch.  Even though I had never been to S & D's before I was the one who recommended that we eat here since my father is half Polish and half Slovak.  Whenever you walk into the store/restaurant the first thing that you notice is a huge display case and a number of tables and chairs.  Inside of the display case is a bunch of different sausages and many other types of polish food.  Moving beyond that takes you to an area with a huge menu on the wall and then a small window where you can order your hot lunch.  Finally beyond that is a Polish store which has a number of different food items including a number of pierogi's, chocolate and oodles of Polish related items and clothing.  Before we went to the restaurant I had looked at the menu and thought that I would be ordering the Red Borscht and Slovak style haluszki.  However as I was standing at the window about to order I made a game time decision and switched to the White Borscht since I wanted some kielbasy slices instead of dumplings.  My father ended up deciding on the Polish Platter which consisted of 3 potato pierogi's, Pittsburgh haluszki (noodles with cabbage onions and butter), a stuffed cabbage and a drink from the cooler.  After you place your order here you are given a number which is then called through a speaker system when your food is ready.  Whenever our number was called the cashier explained to me that my Slovak haluszki was still finishing cooking and that she would bring it out to me.  So I ended up starting with the White Borscht.  Since I have never White Borscht before I can't really comment too much on it other than it tasted as described on the menu.  It was a semi thick soup with a sour taste which I really enjoyed and I think paired perfectly with the kielbasy pieces which had a smoky flavor to them that cut through the sourness of the soup.  After I had finished my soup the haluski came out.  It was described on the menu as being made of potato noodles with cheese and bacon and came out looking unlike any dish I had ever seen before.  The potato noodles were a beige to brownish color and having a lack of a better way to describe them were somewhat gnocchi like in texture and shape although quite a bit heavier.  They were covered with a soft white cheese and bacon and ended up tasting really good.  My dad also really enjoyed them whenever he tried them.  As for his food he really enjoyed the haluszki, enjoyed the pierogi filling but thought the outer dough was a bit thick and finally thought the stuffed cabbage was just ok.  The bottom line for me is that I will head back here again in the future and I would especially recommend it to anyone who is of Polish descent.  The food was really good and the store itself a neat place but my favorite part of our lunch was all of the memories that those foods brought back for my father.  He told me stories about my grandparents and great-grandparents that I have never heard before which I loved.  As we were leaving the restaurant he also told me that he would like to go back in the future and take his sister and cousin.",

The meat was fantastic and cooked perfectly. The bread that it was on was clearly homemade and of the highest quality. The sauerkraut wasn't too bad, but it wasn't the best I've ever had. They put a lot of mustard on the sandwich, which was the only thing I did not like. I will get the pierogis at the end of the week, as that is easily my favorite Polish dish (just was craving some high quality kielbasi this afternoon!). Overall I'd definitely recommend. Highly authentic and it felt like the girls that worked there were fresh off the boat (who doesn't love that authentic feel?)",

Food can be ordered and paid for and then brought out when it is ready.   We were here on a weekend and while it was busy, we were able to get a table. The interior is like a small store/market with a small area with some tables to eat. Service was friendly and pretty quick too. Think in between fast food service and sit down meal. Restroom was available with a key for customers. Prices also very reasonable.   I will definitely be back to get some delicious pierogis from S&D again!",

We found street parking easily and made our way in. There was a huge line at the deli counter..we took a quick glance and could see why! Tons of smoked meats and polish delights!  Walk back a little further and there are single and communal tables for dining and a very small window to place your order. We stared at the menu for a long time before deciding on the polish platter. This included pierogis, stuffed cabbage and haluski. He also ordered red borsht which I was pretty excited to try! You pay at the window and they hand you a number..find a seat and wait.  The only reason I'm not giving five stars is because of the extreme smoke coming from the kitchen and the cold temps inside..  They finally called out our number to grab our tray of food. The pierogis were absolutely perfect..buttery and warm..sauteed just right. The stuffed cabbage was in a deliciously sweet tomato sauce which kind of melded with the butter from the haluski..so delicious.   Pretty sure I won't have to do much convincing to get him to go back tomorrow too!",

Parking was tricky as street parking and parking lots are available but at a cost. The place is a carry out, with a limited seating area and a well-stocked Polish market. They were out of the mushroom soup so we had the red and white Borsch. We also had the Kielbasa Platter that comes with 3 pierogi (1 cheese & 2 mushroom w/ kraut) a generous plate of Haluski (egg noodles and cabbage) and a single thick, Kielbasa. What a real treat this place turned out to be. It was nothing less than superlative-quality, passed-down-from-generations-recipes of home-made goodness!!! The red borsch was clear broth that was a bit sweet but a great spicy taste to counter the sweet flavor, plus I love beets. The white borsch looked like sausage gravy for biscuits and it was heartier than the red, with a good amount of Kielbasa slices. The egg noodles were buttery, not over-cooked and very addictive that was complimented perfectly by the cabbage and a well-prepared, crispy-on-the-outside-but-not-over-cooked, Kielbasa. I might have been smiling the whole time eating that food. The service was excellent because of their friendliness, willingness to help and abundant patience. Pittsburgh as a whole was sooooo very friendly and patient!!!!! Cannot wait to come back to Pittsburg and come back to S&D; we might eat there 2x next time.",

We came in on a Sunday at 1pm and the place was empty when we arrived, but TOTALLY packed when we left.   I've only had pierogis once in my life and I absolutely LOVED them. They were the Costco frozen ones too, haha. I didn't know the homemade kinds could taste THAT much better than the frozen ones, but holy moly. We ordered 2 mixed platters that came with pierogis, stuffed cabbage, and haluski along with 1 platter of mixed pierogis. We ordered both boiled and fried because we didn't know any better, but the boiled ones were 100x better than the fried ones. We thought we ordered TOO much food, but ended up eating almost all of it. Left so stuffed I couldn't function the rest of the day. It was me and my boyfie's first time having haluski and we both loved it.  The best part of the meal was hearing my boyfie's dad say that he felt like he was back at Grandma's house eating a home cooked meal :').  We ended up finding some frozen pierogis in the freezer in the back and took 3 packs home :) Can't wait to eat them!!",

My husband and I shared a platter of pierogies that included potato & cheddar, potato & farmer cheese, and kraut and mushroom.  They were wonderful and reminded me of ravioli and/or dumplings.  My favorite was the potato and cheddar.  Gave me a warm fuzzy feeling and sent me into a carb bliss.  So if you are a fan of small warm stuffed pockets of pasta, you will enjoy these. Sweet ones are also on the menu, but we will save those for next time.  We also shared the Kiszka which is old fashioned blood sausage served fried with onions.  Ew, why would anyone eat that?! It sounds vile, and I never would have eaten it had I read the description carefully.  But you know what? It was really good! This time ignorance paid off!  No real service here, but the young ladies working behind the window were nice.  It's deli style--order at the window, pay, and they call your number when it's ready.  A small number of tables are available inside the store where you can also find many polish products, frozen foods (e.g. frozen pierogies) and souvenirs.  Overall, an extremely pleasing lunch!  We also had our eyes on those potato pancakes, so we may have to come back relatively soon.",

    "text": "Good sweet JEEBUS, how to begin.   My husband and I are third and fourth generation polaks from the Chicagoland area, and we were on a trip through Pittsburgh, without much time to stop and sight see.  We were googling something simple like \"food to eat if you visit Pittsburgh\", and several Polish suggestions came up.  After a quick glance at the menu for S&D, we rushed right over for breakfast before hitting the road.   And OH MY GOODNESS.  It was heavenly.  I learned that the way I normally make Haluski (without meat) is considered Pittsburgh style!  Who knew!  It was wonderful, and came with gobs of sour cream.  My husband ordered the kielbasy platter and he said it was wonderful, I tasted the mustard and it was spicy and YUM.  I ordered the Pittsburgh haluski, and we split two orders of their cheddar pierogi, and their potato and farmer's cheese pierogi.  I'll take a side note here to quickly say that I am a straight up pierogi snob.  My family has a very specific recipe that I've never seen anywhere else (I'm sure it's a strange post-immigration cluster fuck that has stuck around), and because of eating my family pierogis fresh out of the pan since I was a kid, I rarely enjoy pierogis any other way. We have family pierogi-fests every year and we all come together to do a giant cook.  I know pierogi. I tend to hate the potato-cheese combo, and I normally think it's bland and uninspired.  Simply put: I expect to be disappointed with pierogis, and I tend to think they all pretty much taste like Mrs. T's if they have potato in them.   WELL.  I have been proven wrong, for the first time ever.   S&D offers two options for their pierogi.   Cooked = which I assume just means boiled. Fried = obviously fried up in butter after being boiled.   I was SUPER happy to see this option because in my house, we boil and then fry.  At least in restaurants in the Chicagoland area, this seems unusual.  I'm not sure why, we have a huge Polish community and I would have thought this was normal, but I guess not.  Anyways, it was wonderful to see the option, because normally when ordering pierogi they come out soggy and boiled like italian gnocci, with no golden crisp to them.  This got me excited.  I ordered four of the cheddar, and four of the farmer's cheese and potato.  I was a bit bummed out to see nothing similar to the family recipes, but oh well.   The plate of pierogis that was handed over to me was one of the most beautiful sights I've ever beheld.  Four perfect little dumplings, practically floating in a warm, buttery pond, topped with green onions.  My goodness.  The butter wasn't just butter.  It had to have been cooked with garlic and onion, or something.  I have no clue but it was like heaven, actual heaven in my mouth.  The filling was creamy, and warm, and just UUUUUUUGGGGGHHH I WANT MORE.  My husband and I completely enjoyed our experience there, and it was above and beyond our expectations.  The food was like eating at home, like having your grandma cook for you.  It was the first time in my life that I've been able to eat and enjoy excellent Polish food without having to work for a while day and a half ahead of time, sweating and destroying my kitchen with family in order to reap the rewards.  It was a HUGE treat being able to just order, and enjoy.  And boy did I enjoy.  It was an experience.  And we got home to our Chicago suburb seven hours later feeling depressed and whiny that we're going to have to drive 8 hours the next time we want to go back.",

I'll keep taking my friends here when they come to visit, but what really keeps me coming back is the Cracovia Super Extra Hot Mustard. It's an import and it's sincerely the greatest mustard I've ever had. Serve it with some latkes; mix it with honey and sugar for a good chicken nugget dipping sauce; put a spoonful into a roux for a spicy edge to your mac and cheese; spread it on some bread for your cold cuts; or, let's be honest, just eat a little bit with a spoon every time you see it in the fridge.  Buy some Cracovia Super Extra Hot Mustard, and treat yourself to some good Polish lunch while you're at it. If you don't like the mustard, let me know, and I can name a few dozen people who would be glad to take it off your hands. Nawet drwala powala!",

Came in a Saturday at noon and it was crowded but people come in and out and it wasn't too hard to snag a table.   Food: All aboard the train to carbstown and starchville. Not complaining about that fact, these foods are True polish staples, just stated as a note to come prepared hungry and leave knowing you'll have a lot of carbs in the belly :) kielbasy platter and an order of potato pancakes for two people. Everything is reasonably priced, especially for the portions. The kielbasa was good, but on the drier side. The pierogis were tasty, however I asked if they could do one cheddar and potato and two potato and farmers cheese since the partner doesn't like mushrooms. The hostess wrote it down on the receipt, but unfortunately the cooks gave us one potato and cheddar cheese and TWO sauerkraut and mushroom. I realize I could've said something, but I had already shoved half of the pierogis in my mouth lol. Either way, they're good and filling and there is strong flavors of cheddar cheese and the tang of sauerkraut in each respective pierogi. What takes the cake here is the haluszki. It's light, flavorful, and has a bit of a pepper kick to it. I could seriously come back to just eat a whole plate of this. The noodles were perfectly cooked too, not too mushy or not too hard.   Potato pancakes were a little too oily, but they were crunchy and tasted like what you would expect.   Also stopped by the deli to get a lemon-filled polish doughnut, which was airy and filled with lots of lemon jelly-like filling.   Service: very friendly people work here. It's comforting. The guy at the deli let us try some of the Moscow ham for free and it was delicious.",

Mostly a grocery store, toward the back are tables and a counter where you put in your order. We had pierogies and kielbasa with mustard. The kielbasa was so tender and delicious. The pierogies were steamed and also very tender. They had a variety of pierogie fillings to choose from. I highly recommend grabbing some deliciousness while you're in Pittsburgh.",

You order your food at a small window, they give you a number, and when the food is ready they call you to come and pick up your food. We ordered the Polish platter: 3 pierogi, haluszki and one stuffed cabbage. Each one of the items were perfectly made and so tasty that it makes you want to eat more. Very authentic and with that grandma made taste!",

He deemed the  Potato cheddar = Mac and cheese pierogi Kraut mushroom = they made me like mushroom pierogi  Sweet cheese = so especially great they deserve their own plate.  My youngest surprised me by rejecting the kielbasa and eating almost all of my stuffed cabbage. Even the cabbage!! He also suggested that when we get home, we set up a Goabki stand in the neighborhood.  I think this well made food made a positive lasting impression on my family. Mission accomplished.  Bonus: my husband left with several sausage sticks for secret midnight snacks. :)",

Homemade. Definitely get the potato and cheese and the sauerkraut and mushroom. You'll feel like you're eating in your Bubba's kitchen!! You can order everything they sell and eat there at the little cafe in the deli. It's just a few basic kitchen tables in the rear of the store, but a MUST DO. We would have loved to have tried the cabbage rolls and the potato pancakes, but we already had lunch reservations elsewhere and couldn't eat too much.  We of course took home additional pierogis. They have them fresh in the refrigerator or frozen in the back of the store. We also took home the Polish Regular kielbasa and the Juniper kielbasa. Both simply wonderful. Both kielbasas were smoked to perfection with nice snappy skin. And we couldn't pass up taking home a poppy seed roll!!  And the best part...everything we bought cost just under $50. I'm already planning to visit again and ordering from the Deli online!!",

There is no city with a greater Polish influence than Pittsburgh, and there is no Polish dish more famous than the Pierogi. The yelp faithful clearly feel S&D is king, so to S&D I go.   Located in the strip district, there's nothing fancy about this market, just classics dishes that feel like they came out of your adopted polish grandmothers kitchen.   Aside from the pierogis, i sampled other old world favorites like stuffed cabbage and potato pancakes. It's clear with one bite that these are all homemade from scratch. The pierogis pretty much melt in your mouth, tender and flavorful.   S&D is the real deal. With prices like these, you are only limited by your stomach. Culinary bucket list check off....",

I like my pierogies with a bit more chew (such as the ones I had when I visited Szczecin, Poland). The ones here have too high a ratio of wrapper to filling and they were over cooked to the point where they became soggy.   I also found the fillings slightly off-putting. They tend to stuff their pierogies with sauteed veggies and cheese, which is absolutely fine, but their fillings were also too wet so the pierogies only had one texture upon consumption: mushy.   In terms of cleanliness, perhaps I made the mistake of eating here, but I felt very uncomfortable by how old the pastries in the display cabinet appeared and by the abundance of crumbs on the ground.   If they can figure out how to properly cook pierogies, I may consider coming back",

I tried two variations  - cheese and farmhouse and definitely preferred the cheese, as I found the farmhouse to be a bit too tart. I found the texture of the pierogis to be less firm here, hence my not liking them as much.  So I also got to try Hunter's Stew as one person in our foodie tour had a mild milk intolerance and this was basically sausage with sauerkraut- I liked the taste of this and wouldn't mind getting it if return here.  Btw, it was a bit disappointing too, that no-one of Polish origin seemed to be working the shop the day we came - I was all ready to try out the few words of Polish I had picked up while living/ working in Warsaw and when I greeted the staff behind the counter with a hearty  \"Dzien dobry\" was met with blank looks and they said they didn't speak any Polish!

While they helped us order their pierogis online, we ordered some hot, fresh pierogis to eat on the spot. We tried their pierogi platter which was an assortment of a dozen mixed between 4 flavors. The flavors we tried were potato cheddar cheese, potato farmer cheese, kraut & mushroom, and spinach & meat. They came out hot and dressed in butter and onions, and the dough is as light as a pillow.

Have ordered their kraut/mushroom pierogi, which are delicious; only wish they were bigger (about the size of a pizza roll).  Their kishka is wonderful and very authentic.  Tried stuffed cabbage, which was very good, but have made better myself.  Just recently ordered Bigos, or Hunter's stew.  Hasn't arrived yet, but looks and sounds delicious.",

Well ordered them, got them on 12/23 (just in time) well they were great the dough was perfect like mine the filling was not the same as mine but excellent, fillings are subjective.  They were well worth the money spent and will order from them again.  Also tried the mushroom dumplings (youzka) for my borscht they were just like mine loved them.  A great place when you have high standards and can't make you own.",

I just found my @ home store in Pittsburgh. They just opened last week (Dec. 15 or so) and are still building their store so its not all finished.. but when they are done they will have hot polish food for lunch and take out. Yes!!!   The couple is from Poland that moved here a couple years ago. They import their sausage from Joe & Frank in Chicago. I grew up in Chicago for 16 years (after immigrating from Poland) and this Joe & Frank make their own varities that are really really good, probabbly the best in North Side Chicago. The prices are very reasonable!   S&D Deli is on Penn between 22 and 23rd. They are still in construction but I encourage you all to visit and help this couple start up.I know I will! I was so extremely happy to find the food that Ive been missing since moving here a year ago.... They do have the best (next to Chicago) sausages from Joe & Frank and are friendly in explaining the varieites. Try the Kabanosy, they are my favourite. They also carry Tymbark juices like Cherry and  Apple Cherry etc.. they are really really good. The wife makes fresh pierogis too that i havent tried but its a great idea.  I also found fresh saurkraut there AND polish dried mushrooms (maslaki).. and all the chocolates I adore... Im sorry im just so elated with this..  Im so elated that Im thinking of offering to help them out promoting their shop at polish events around town.  Pittsburgh really needs this!! And i hope that they make it .",

It's an odd looking place, like it doesn't know what it wants to be...is it a restaurant, a deli, a bodega or a sports apparel store? Well, it turns out it's all of the above. Although the restaurant is odd looking - you order at a small window in the middle of the store - the food is 100% worth it! We got two kinds of pierogies - sauerkraut and mushroom/cheese - and a pig in a blanket (which is spicy meat wrapped in a cabbage leaf). Both were absolutely amazing - as if my Polish grandmother had made them herself. The grocery store also offered unique polish groceries - we got a spicy mustard that was very delicious. It lasted about a week in our house as we ended up putting it on everything. The best part of the experience was the great customer service from the authentically Polish girls that were working behind the counter. Overall, everything was excellent and we will definitely return!! PS: I'm not polish and I don't have a Polish grandmother:)",

I got the kielbasy  platter which included a sizable piece of kielbasa, 3 pierogi (which were fried/sauteed) and haluszki (apparently Pittsburgh style which I've never heard of - they seemed like normal haluszki to me). Additionally my wife and I split the bigos which was very good - not greasy at all. What makes the food so good is most of it is covered in butter - but you don't get polish food if you are watching your figure. Also, this place sells tons of polish meats and deli style items at the best prices I have seen in quite a while - they get all their stuff from a deli in Chicago. They even have pork in aspic (galareta) which is pretty rare and I've only seen for sale once in Chicago. My wife got the meatless platter which includes potato pancakes in place of the kielbasa. Overall, the food and portions were excellent. I plan of frequenting this place at least 2x/month.",

We walked in worried that we would be too early for lunch (it was around 11am), but a line had already formed at the order counter. Unfortunately, S&D was out of cheddar and potato pierogis on the day we visited, so we opted for a platter of farmers cheese and potato, potato, and kraut and mushroom. Although the website says that fried pierogis are an option, we were told at the counter that we could only have them boiled. No big deal, as we love pierogis either way and were very excited to try them.  After about a 15 minute wait, our number was finally called. A heaping plate of pierogis dripping in butter was brought to our table. Upon diving in, we knew the wait and agreeing to the boiled pierogis was well worth it. We enjoyed every last pierogi on the plate, but our favorite was the mushroom and kraut. Overall, S&D is well worth the stop. We are already counting down the days until our return!",

We ordered a dozen pierogis, your choice of flavor so we opted for the most common cheese and potatoes. I wanted them pan fried so I specified this on my order, with the butter/onion sauce on the side. I was so disappointed when we got boiled pierogis instead. They were mushy and tasted like mash potatoes. Boo!! Ruined my pierogi experience - it was on my list of must haves while visiting Pittsburgh too.   We also ordered the Kielbasa sausage to try. It was good! I liked that it wasn't so greasy. It came with bread, some beet jam, and hot mustard. Very interesting combo. We got the Polish Style Haluszki as well since we haven't had it before, it was noodles with butter, cheese and bacon. We actually quite liked it and it was a good sized portion for the price. I think we enjoyed everything, except for the boiled pierogis. Wish they would've honored our request to fry them cause we probably would've enjoyed them a lot more. The apricot cookies were buttery and delicious as well! Nice sweet treat to end our meal!",

    "text": "This polish market is a hidden gem on the strip in Pittsburgh.  At first glance you might miss that there is a cafe set in the back of this deli/ market. On day 3 of our families food road trip my wife decided she wanted Eastern European and yelp and google reviews sent us to S&D.  We shared a pierogi plate with several varieties, a kielbasa with mustard and a cup of borscht.  The freshness of each items made for a much better polish experience than the frozen pierogi and Michigan market kielbasa we have had at home.  As we devoured our food we all agreed that if we had a place like S&D near home we would never serve the frozen options available to us at home.  As far as the borscht I personally have never been much of a fan, but as this is not my trip I was excited to try (especially from a place that seemed to hold to a more traditional roots of it's regional cuisine).  It was curiously good and pretty hard to explain.  My previous borscht experiences have been closer to stew consistency but this was most definitely broth based with meat dumplings.  I would describe the broth as both tangy and rich (mildly sweet).  My wife and I will enjoy trying to duplicate their effort at home (especially seeing as how we couldn't identify the sour component in the broth). Overall the food was prepared simply and traditionally in a way that musters memories of a home cooked meal in the \"old country \" if in fact we were from Poland.  The borscht was the most unique and unexpected menu item we chose and it leaves me wanting more and also wanting a good hearty bread and butter to enjoy it with.   Great find by my wife and we will be back.",

We got the 12 pierogi platter for $11, and we got a mix of bacon/potato/cheese, potato/cheddar, and potato/farm cheese, all of which came with a covering of butter and onions. They came out fast and were absolutely delicious!  The kielbasa was $6 and was a sausage served with half a loaf of bread and a sort of sweet borscht sauce that paired well with the meat. Try it out if dumplings are not your thing. Great service + great/cheap food = a 5/5 for me.",

    "text": "2 weeks ago my work colleagues and I were in Pittsburgh. During lunchtime, I took them to the strip district to try some Polish food, which I had heard was a must here. Shortly after arriving to this deli, my group decided to leave, as they were not familiar with the type of food offered here. However, a co-worker and I felt that we had to try this place, so we split from the group and returned. I'm very glad we did because the experience we had here was fantastic.  I had a pierogi platter with a combination of cheddar cheese, farmer cheese, mushroom, and sweet pierogies. The pierogies were fresh and flavorful. I also had a polish sausage, which was a great compliment. My co-worker had a kielbasa platter, which she also enjoyed.   The service was very good; people here were very nice and friendly. The ambiance was casual, but welcoming. I can recomendable this place.",

I ordered the pierogi platter - I asked for a substitute which the kitchen forgot to do, so they gave me extras. I had all three pierogies from the platter plus the daily special of kraut and bacon. Wow, these were phenomenal. My favorites were the two different cheese types - smooth bold flavor. I'm not a huge kraut fan but the bacon kraut were also very good. The mushroom kraut were my least favorite, but if you like Kraut, I'm sure they're great. They're served in a buttery sauce that is just perfection. Service was friendly and price can't be beaten. I wish I had time to come back and try even more.",

    "text": "\"Dzien Dobry!\"  'Good Day' Everyone from \"S&D Polskie Delikatesy\" on Penn Ave in Pittsburgh!  And it was...   Upon walking up to this very prideful little market and deli, you can smell the Borscht before even opening the door; the thick and heavy wonderful stench of different paprikas, pickled cabbages and of course, the assortment of meats that have been packed inside of the Pig Casings (Squeels) and set on display to buy by the pound.  Or perhaps that smell upon entering wasn't what I listed above but was actually the smell of the Head or Blood Cheese they had on display for sale .  Yeah, that's probably it.  Regardless of the aromas, this place Oozed with character almost as much as their \"To-Die-For\" Perogies oozed with that simple deliciousness we have all come to love about Perogies... More on the meal in a minute.  From a wall of delicious Sweets to a deli case filled with Polish favorites to  hundreds of other products, items and chatchki's for sale in this little space, S&D was charming in it's extremely rustic and authentic way.  I didn't pick any up, however, the homemade SaurKraut looked amazing and they even have a case for you to pick up your favorite Polish Meals all frozen and ready to go.  But this is a Food review, right?  {oink}  Upon placing my order with Maria and Hannah, I was given my placard and politely told to wait as the two of them were handling the flow of the business extremely well.  The owners have surely streamlined this food service operation as the efficiency in which these ladies worked was amazing.  Constantly busy from taking orders, preparing the plates, calling the numbers, handling the register and oh, running back and forth to the register for the grocery end of things as well.  The owners are lucky to have these two.  Someone told me I had to try their Pork Stew... I introduced myself, told them I was here to do a review, asked what I should have as I definitely wanted to try the stew.    {Chokes back a tear}  They were all out.  I was told by Maria to try their Kielbasy Platter as it is what most people get and is definitely their biggest seller.     Meeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaat.  The Kielbasy had a deep smokiness and a pop from the casing that made me smile as soon as I began to chew.  You ever just take a bite of something and it Sparks a memory?   This perfectly grilled and seared Kielbasy was what I expected.  Dense, Flavorful, Fatty.  I added a bit of spicy mustard for that zing I adore for successive mouthfuls.  I then shoveled three, COUNT THEM, three forkfulls of (and in great succession!) of the Haluszki.  For those of you without Polish friends growing up, this is a noodle dish that is accentuated by different herbs and spices and are coated with a slippery sealing of butter... You know, more fat... YUM.   The carefully crafted noodles were tender, warm and as most Polish Food is rather bland, these were, unfortunately so, underwhelmingly seasoned. They were however perfectly cooked and not mushy or crusty as noodles sometimes can be.  But...  The Perogies everyone...  Yup.  {{}}  They crushed it with the Perogies.  There were three different varities of perogies served on the platter. After Bite Number One of the \"Potato and Cheddar\"... I was done.  This made me close my eyes from just the texture of the Perogies hitting my tongue.  The softness of the dough was almost indistinguishable compared to the lucious, soft and CHEESY mixture of the filling.  It literally was the best thing I have had in my mouth in weeks.  This was followed, by bite number two and I began balling as it finished off that Perogie and I knew there wasn't anymore of that type!  The other two were delicious in their own rights being filled with either a \"Kraut and Mushroom\" or a \"Potato and Farmers Cheese.  There are no words for these perfectly crafted bits of Polish Perfection.  Come.  Smell it out like I did and do your snouts a favor...  A very solid:  Oinks.",

It was hard to pick just one thing because I saw all my polish food cravings so I just got it all, even the beet soup (borscht). Ok so the platter is the way to go. I loved the stuffed cabbage but I can't say it's better then my grandmas. The plum Pierogi was interesting not a lot of flavor. The traditional cheese and potatoes was the best one. I didn't get to try the farmer cheese because they sold out of them. Wow of advise don't skip the cookies for dessert those were SO good. Everyone ate them before I could get a second one.",

All of the fillings are nothing short of delicious, but the potato & cheddar-stuffed ones are a solid stand-by any time. The pierogies come topped with warm melted butter and onions and are absolutely to die for! Need I say more? You just can't go wrong!   You can order a hot plate of pierogies to eat in, or you can take refrigerated ones to go. I also reccomend the halusky as another great dish, either to eat in or take out.

When your number is called, you collect the food. If you want water, you have to buy a bottle of it.  The food, though, is delicious.  I got the red borscht with meat dumplings. It was somewhat vinegary, but flavorful. It isn't the smooth and thick borscht you'd expect at a Russian restaurant. My companion got the mushroom soup, which she devoured, with a side of sauerkraut-and-mushroom pierogi, with fried onions on top. Surprisingly, these were not very sour at all, and provided a nice mix of textures and flavors.  For dessert, we split an order of the pierogi-of-the-day, cherry. This is not your cherry-pie-filling; it was a mildly-sweet and slightly-tart cherry fruit inside, with minimal water, and the dough wasn't overly chewy. It was a very pleasant and refreshing end to a nice little meal.",

I know Polish food can be heavy, but there's a difference between a heavy food and overly done and oily. Maybe the usual chef was out or we came at a poor time because our food didn't look like some of the other plates that I saw on Yelp, but unfortunately I can't really say because I have never been there before. As much as we appreciated the second portion we got for free because they gave us the wrong order the first time, we didn't finish either order because it was hard to down the oily and mushy haluszki and pierogi. I would love to give this place a second chance, but I don't have plans to visit PA any time soon. I'm just glad other people have had more positive experiences and I hope that continues",

I grew up eating Mrs. T's and more recently tried Stuff'd Pierogi bar and you'll never go back to either of them after having S&D pierogis. You can tell at other pierogi joints like Stuff'd that their pierogis are mass produced without care. The borders of their pierogis are hard while S&D pierogis are soft throughout the entire pierogi and appear to be fresh. S&D pierogis are \"simple\" with three flavors: cheddar cheese, farmers cheese, and kraut&mushroom. I literally go out of my way and ride the bus for 30 minutes to get these pierogis.   I haven't tried many of their other featured items, but S&D's also has great Haluski and kielbasa.   S&D's is somewhere I will continue to go for as long as I live in Pittsburgh. If you're an authentic pierogi fanatic they're definitely worth making the trip out to the Strip for.",

But it wont be my last and I have already mentioned and recommend this Polish Deli to all my friends and relatives.  You can eat in or take out. I did the take out to eat at home a little later after shopping around the strip.     It's a little unusual, I think, because it is both a store and restaurant which specialized very successfully in Polish and Eastern European food. In the store find imported canned goods, dry goods and Polish Folk Art pieces. Browsing around is enjoyable finding food and items I have never seen before and would never see whit out this little place serving our area.  The deli case is just crazy with a wild and wide array of meats and dishes. Pierogi, Kielbasy, and Pastries for sure, but I bet you never have seen such a wide and generous selection to choose from. It's just crazy wonderful, they have twelve kinds of Pierogi and I did not count the kinds of Kielbasy and Sausages.  I had to ask lots of questions, what is this one, what is that one, what is the difference between them.   After my fifty questions I selected some great Kielbasy, Pierogis, Haluski, as my haul to take home. This made a delightful meal that the whole family enjoyed.  I don't know for sure, but I am going to guess they are family owned and operated. They will get my return business, and I hope my friends and relatives go and if you like Polish old world food, this is the best I have had around here.",

Other items to try is the awesome array of pierogies  and potato pancakes - just astounding.

    "text": "Some of you know my real last name. It is Polish and difficult for Americans to pronounce. Some of you also know that I lived in Central Europe for two years.  Thus, I have thankfully experienced authentic Polish cuisine.  Walking into S&D reminds me of being back in Krakow! Pleasant staff chatting in Polish, magazines with extraneous amounts of the letter \"z.\", and the smell of delicious pierogi!  I always pick up a few candy bars and other Polish food items, but I usually go there for lunch. My favorite items are the (authentic) halusky with farmer's cheese, and the kraut/mushroom pierogi.   After I'm finished, I also grab some frozen pierogi from the freezer and order some sausage from the deli. The staff is always helpful.  So why the docked star? First of all, sometimes service in the lunch area is painfully slow.  Also, mostly on weekends, often half the lunch menu is unavailable by noon! I realize this is because S&D is popular and they use fresh ingredients. But I love my brunch halusky and am disappointed when it isn't available.   Overall, however, I adore this place and stop in every time I am in the Strip District.",

Still, when in Rome.....  I tried some of the pierogis.  They were all prepared as well as can be.  Moist, rich filling.  They had fresh fillings and the dough was still moist.  As good as they could possibly be.  They had a sweet and savory quality.  I would rank it as good as any polish food as I've had.",

There are masses of us that eat this kind of food at home in 2012?  Actually I think S&D partially fills this Pittsburgh void.   Their deli and take out food is really really good.        The deli is exceptional and lovingly operated.  The dessert section has sweets that might look different, but are fantastic!  (I love the cheese cakes and the merangue cakes!)  The take-out/eat in area looks very sparse and can be a wait.  The food is delicious, but beware....it is polish and not always polish american!  The pieogi are always home made and a pleasure to eat!  The feel of the whole place is family run and you can tell they are aspiring to be great!      I stop in at S&D everytime I'm in the strip.   Now if they (or someone else) could fill the niche of Eastern European diner or proper sit-down restaurant....I'd be completely happy!",

    "text": "This place is incredible, I have to say. The pierogis(4 for $4) are stunningly good, the dough is so soft that it melts like butter in your mouth(Or maybe that's just all of the butter, they give plenty!), and the insides are flavorful. These aren't your standard freezer pierogis, full of bland potato mush - whoever is making these has perfected their craft, and cares about every one.  I've also tried a few other items, like the borscht... It wasn't my favorite, pretty lightly flavored, but that's OK, it wasn't bad, just not as hearty as I would like. The store is filled with funny polish novelty convenience store items, including chocolate bars and other knick-knacks. The back seating area takes up about half of the store.  I do have one complaint about this place, and that's the wait. They have a poster that says you can get any pierogi filling with a 10 minute wait - or cheddar cheese, cottage cheese, or kraut+mushroom immediately, which to me implies that your wait when there is nobody else in the place would be less than 10 minutes. Every time I'm in here, though, I'm waiting well over 10 minutes to get an order, so they should really try and cut down on the wait time.  Also, like every other place in the strip, S&D is plagued by not being open long enough, so my only chance to enjoy is to try and make a bus trip on my lunch break or fight parking on the weekends - neither appealing, but I have taken both options to sink my teeth into these delicious pierogis",

Always good. I tried for the first time, their Bigos. I love any form of vegetable and they had cabbage a d few other vegetables in here. It was on the salty side, but still edible. place is always nicely laid out. I love their selection of chocolates.  I had this little piece of chocolate called tiramisu.

I had never had soft, doughy pierogi like this! You could actually taste the melted cheese inside the cheddar ones--this is nothing like Mrs. T's frozen lumps of starch.  While the shop closes at 4:30, the kitchen closes at 3:30, and you probably want to get here before 3. We arrived at 3:20, not knowing the kitchen closed early, and the Polish woman working the kitchen was VERY reluctant to cook any food for us. We felt bad so we only ordered off the quick menu (there's I think 4 different types you can get right away, but if you want to wait longer they have tons of other options, including fruit-filled!).  The grocery section had a large variety of Polish goods. As an Italian, I feel more at home surrounded by pasta and mozzarella cheese, but I imagine this place would be a wonderful refuge for those with Polish roots. Watch what you're buying though, many of the canned goods were well past their expiration dates.",

The deli/store/sit-in atmosphere was very chill, and one can browse around each of the areas freely. We decided to first eat lunch, and it was quite difficult to decide among all these inexpensive items. Ended up trying a kielbasa platter, the stuffed cabbage, and the special beef tripe soup.   Everything was delicious--my favorite was actually the soup, which I have no idea how often they rotate it in. Amazingly warm and flavorful, and very much full of meat. I was also a fan of the kielbasa, which was perfectly smoked, as well as the delicious pierogi (cheese and spinach that day). The stuffed cabbage was also an interesting choice, seeing as how they layer the meat inside with cabbage and then put it the tomato sauce. Finally, the cashiers were extremely nice, and we didn't wait more than 5 minutes for the food.  After eating, we browsed the store section, which contained a whole bunch of Polish snacks, candies, juices, and pastries. It turns out they sell a lot of their items refrigerated in the back, including different flavors of pierogi, soups, and cabbage. We only ended up buying a fruit nectar and jarred herrings, but I definitely look forward to next time to trying more new things.",

Towards the back, you can order dine in food - pirogies, kilebasa, etc and mix and match combo plates. Nothing is above $11. Love these pirogies. I sampled the cheddar and potato, kraut and mushroom and farmers cheese. Fried is $1 more. I always prefer mine boiled.  Yum!",

I left Chicago 8 years ago and have been seeking great polish foot ever since with no success, until now.   Walking into S&D was just like the polish deli's my dad used to take me two and the hot, steamed pierogis, kielbasa, and stuffed cabbage brought back great memories of my grandmother's cooking.  Nothing could have been better on a cool, rainy morning.   The staff was very friendly (and beautiful), the service was quick, and the selection was phenomenal. A True Pittsburgh treasure that I wish I had closer to home.",

There were two other workers there that I saw. After waiting about eight minutes, I kindly excused myself and asked if there was someone else that could wait on me as I had to get back to work. The girl turned around, copped a huge attitude, and adamantly waited on me.  I asked again if there was someone else (not her) that could wait on me as I didn't want to barge in on her current customer.  She was extremely rude and slammed everything that she had in her hands onto the counter. I would say her \"Merry Christmas\" was not sincere.  That will be my last trip into this place.  They obviously don't need my money.  BTW...they don't make their own pierogies or kolbassi.",

Sounds kinda boring doesn't it? Trust me, this is some of the most outstanding comfort food I have ever consumed. If this is boring, I am now ok with boring. If this is what life is like in Poland, I'm ready to pack up and go... Well at least back to the Polish Deli anyway. If there was one food I had to eat for the rest of my life...it probably wouldn't be Polish style haluszki, but it would be on the top of my list for sure!   Ok enough of that. So a plate of haluszki and four meat pierogis is more than enough food for lunch. Go to the S&D Polish Deli and get yours now!",

    "text": "Another 5 star review of S&D.  How about that.  I have to start this off by saying the first time I had S&D's pierogi was at the History Center's Hometown Homegrown event in which they judged about a dozen pierogi from around the city.  S&D's potato and farm cheese were my favorite (sorry, Grandma Urbanik!).  They are incredible.  Like, someone's little Polish grandma is making these.  Literally.  S&D won, by the way.  So this place is 3/4 store selling some serious Polish imports from candy and bakery items to the cheese and prepared foods counter.  If you are looking for anything Eastern European, this is one of the places to start.  Hell, even if you're looking for your lamb butter mold for Easter, get it here.  The other 1/4 is restaurant counter service.  They have platters and big plates to share, but I usually get my own plate of not fried pierogi.  The farm cheese is always the \"special\" of the day when I'm there somehow so it ends up being painfully cheap too.  Like I said, these are so great.  The potato pancakes are also done perfectly.  Being picky, I can't say much for the haluski or kielbasy (\"you don't know what's good!\", responds everyone in my family).  They also sell gift boxes of sweets and/or sausages as well as Polish gift/heritage items.  Lanters, Matrioszka dolls, t shirts, you know.  So if babcia needs a birthday gift, get down to the end of the strip.  You must, must, must have these pierogi while you're around.",

Like the haluski not having square noodles and less weird stuff in a the can goods section they have all the norms/basics of a nice Polish grocery store/deli. They have a small sit down restaurant and even a ready made food section with everything you need for lunch/dinner. In the back they have frozen food and goods and cheeses in the front and back.  My personal favorite is the hunters kielbasa with the farmers cheese perogies and sauerkraut. The sauerkraut is some of the best I have had and is a must try. Also a good price.  I also really like that it's all ready made and I can just take some home warm it up and have a ready to eat dinner in no time.",

There's mustard, dried soup packets, pickled beets, frozen perogies, refrigerated herring filets, candies, cookies - all Polish brands.  The Polish platter was pretty good. I liked the rather stiff cabbage around the stuffed cabbage roll. The perogies were all good, especially the potato and cheese one. The haluzski was ok, it was cooked in a sauce of butter, cabbage, and onions.  They also sell Polish cheese.  Good place to try Polish food - though much of it seems like hearty winter food to me. It all feels a bit salty after eating.",

    "text": "I stopped by this past weekend for lunch by myself.  Having never tried Polish food except for the ubiquitous pierogies, I was keen to sample this unfamiliar cuisine.  Because I can be quite picky about the type and form of meat that I eat, I decided to play it safe and order the meatless platter ($11). It came with the following items: a generous helping of haluski, two potato pancakes, and three pierogies (farmer's cheese, potato/cheddar, mushrom/sauerkraut), as well as sides of applesauce and sour cream for the potato pancakes and pierogies, respectively (see photo).  All of the dishes comprising the platter were cooked perfectly, and were absolutely delicious.  The haluski was al dente, and had a nice butter-herb sauce; the potato pancakes were crispy on the outside with a soft, pliable interior; and the pierogies were flavorful and stuffed with filling.  All of them were good, but my favorite was the potato/cheddar, which had a deliciously warm and savory filling that was well complemented by the cool, creamy sour cream.  These were definitely not your grocery store variety Mrs. T's pierogies, which are served at many restaurants around town--these are the real deal!  As I was waiting for my lunch to be served, I browsed the store and was intrigued by the wide variety of Polish foodstuffs.  My attention was captured in particular by the pierogies in the freezer (the same ones served on my platter, I presume), as well as the interesting soups in the refrigerator in the back (tripe soup, anyone?).  If you're looking for hard-to-find Polish goods, this is probably one of your best bets around town to find them.  If, on the other hand, Polish cuisine is as foreign to you as it is to me, stop by for a delicious, filling lunch that will provide a great introduction to it!",

From the jarred and pickled root vegetables like beets and apples to one of Poland's most popular soups, Zurek, a sour rye soup often served in bread bowls (chunked potatoes and sausage). I was there for the pierogies, the fresh ready-to-eat options were potato and cheddar cheese, potato and farmer's cheese and potato and mushroom. $5 for 4 pierogies. You can order them in or to go - they have maybe 6 - 8 tables but it was a tight fit with the bustling holiday crowd ordering sausages, baked goods and such.  I highly recommend strolling to the back of the store to stock up on their frozen soups: borscht (beet/dumpling soup), mushroom and Zurek. They also have a large freezer filled with at least 10 different types of pierogies to purchase and serve at home. For my next visit, I'll have to try something new like one of the noodle dishes served with sausage and beets. It's all about the beets. I was a wink away from purchasing the Pope John Paul shirt on the wall (fun fact: PPJ was born in Krakow, Poland - I have the earrings, now all I need is the shirt to complete the outfit). This place is as close to Poland as it gets - thank you fellow yelpers for leading me in the right direction;) Or shall I say, Dziekuje?",

    "text": "What I love most about the strip district is the wide range of ethnic foods and markets it serves. Just to name a few you have the Italian markets, Asian markets, Mexican markets and then you have S&D Polish Deli! This place is one of my favorites! My mom is a vendor in the strip district and when I helped her a few years back I would always grab lunch here.   What is there not to love, they have fresh polish meats, polish cheeses, pastries (those angel wings...to die for), hot foods (that you can order to go or dine in) and it's a mini market for polish groceries. Did I mention they sell polish gear too? Hats, hoodies and T-shirts can all be found inside!  They also sell the homemade sauerkraut by the quart, it's delish!! A few other things I have tried are the pierogi's, kielbasa, and my favorite haluszki (Pittsburgh style). All things Polish can be found in this little gem of a store.",

Lots of Polish delicacies such as pickles, sweets, sausages, sauerkraut etc. I purchased so many different things here and was never really disappointed. I am not a huge fan of their stuffed cabbage, but that's my taste buds and has nothing to do with freshness or quality, cause this is consistently good.   Another part that I really loved was their pierogi making class! i came here with a couple of friends on a Thursday night. The class itself was a lot of fun and we all were made feeling welcome all the way through. The family that owns this shop is just really genuine and friendly. The class itself took about 2 hours after which we could enjoy our potato and onion pierogi topped with butter and what else - more onions! :) The family was friendly and bubbly and didn't shy away giving a lot of tips and tricks to cook things to perfection. I felt like being part of the family which made this class so enjoyable.   The prices are average in this shop as well and if you order from the deli you'll be surprised by the portions they hand out. They definitely found a new regular customer in me!",

S&D had packs of a dozen homemade, cooked, pre-dressed with butter and onion in the fridge case to go.  Perfect!  Got the Potato and Farmers Cheese.  They were moist, tender, plump.  The space includes a great deli with all the specialty Polish meats like smoked, blood, and fresh sausages, headcheese, cheeses.  Deli case and lunch counter have hot prepared comfort food for you to eat there or take home.  Back of the space is crammed with imported dry goods, condiments, candies and a body-sized freezer full of frozen pierogis.  Do not miss the fridge full of naturally fermented, homemade sauerkraut and pickles, wow!  They've got everything for you Polish needs right here.",

    "text": "A trip to this deli/store is a trip down memory lane for me.  I'm 100% Polish and grew up with grandparents making pierogi and other Polish treats.    There are essentially two portions to this shop.  The deli that serves the meals and the convenience store type back end of the shop.  The food they serve is home made and authentic.  The platters may seem pricey at $11 each, but well worth it for the amount of food that you get.    The store portion has a great selection of Polish related trinkets and apparel.  Think butter lamb molds, Polish flags, decorated easter eggs and a plethora of mugs, keychains, etc.  The back portion of the store has the treats they serve in the deli in frozen form along with a variety of Polish grocery items ranging from candy to tea and everything in between.  My favorite part of S&D is that they have started doing cooking classes.  The first of the series was a pierogi making class.  It was well organizes and so much fun!  I purchased our class through Groupon but would have paid the full price with how much fun we had.  The instructor Marta and her assistant were funny and helpful.  I felt like I had known them my whole life by the time we were leaving the store.  The class started with Marta showing us how the dough is made (with one person from the class assisting).  Then she walks you through how one filling is made (potato and farmer's cheese with onion).  Because of the class size and time, these steps are done for the group as a whole rather than individually.  Once those initial steps are done, each participant is given their dough and filling and after brief instruction on the proper way to close the pierogi, you are let loose.  The nice thing is that the instructors are there for you to go over whether your dough is rolled thin enough, if you have the right amount of stuffing, etc.  After you finish your pierogis, you take them over to the pots and boil them.  You can eat them in the store that evening or take them home.  Most people gobbled theirs up because they were so tasty.    I really look forward to seeing what class they offer next and will likely sign up shortly after it is announced.",

This is a cute little place on the strip with women who actually speak the language. The setup is a bit odd, the tables unstable and honestly they all needed a good wipe down. I asked for and did my table myself. Oh well, they weren't perfect.  On to the food! I went with the Polish Platter which consisted of Halupki, perogies, a mammoth pig in the blanket and a drink. I did get a extra pig because I have portion issues. Plus my W refuses to make them because we aren't polish. What kind of reason is that?! Anyway, the food was well seasoned and hot on the plate. Also, the lunch was $11 which isn't too bad for the strip. Hope you enjoy my picture. :)",

They have three regular perogie flavors and have a daily special flavor on rotation. The three regular flavors are cheddar potato, farmers cheese and potato, and kraut and mushrooms. My favorite were the kraut ones because they funny enough, remind me of chinese dumplings and I am a big mushroom fan.   I could have done without the keilbasa sausage I got. It was pretty hard and dry when I got it and I mainly ordered it for the kraut, which was unremarkable (made with pork but rather two-dimensional.)",
