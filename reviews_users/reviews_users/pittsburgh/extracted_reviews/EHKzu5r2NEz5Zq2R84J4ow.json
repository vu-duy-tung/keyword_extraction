    "text": "Taipei Tokyo - These are cities in Taiwan and Japan being named here that giveaway and designate the style of food you are going to see in this restaurant in Monroeville. Taipei City is the capital of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and of course we all know Tokyo is the capital of Japan. In the US their location is situated in a nearby annex to the Monroeville Mall. Basically they are a pretty decent Chinese restaurant with a good business in Sushi. Eat In or Take Out. We have done both ways and both in and out are pretty good.  Also we have dined on Chinese and Sushi and both are good. The have a wide ranging menu with choices galore and the food is nicely presented and consistently good. For those inclined there is a full bar. Service here is very quick and friendly enough, but certainly efficient is the best word I would say. This restaurant is usually very busy, but not with too long of a wait. I think the wait is shorted by how fast and efficiently they get the food out to the tables who have ordered. There are a good number of booths, a number of 2 and 4 top tables and several large round tables for groups. I love round tables for groups. Very accommodating I would call it. Take out is very fast and is ready almost always before you can get there it pick it up.  No reason to be shy to eat here, but no reason to travel any great distance either. But you might want to just to try it. If you are anywhere in the East, this restaurant will provide you a decent selection and quality of food. Price-wise they are very reasonable. So I'm saying based on service, price, selection and quality, this could be the best Chinese restaurant in Monroeville.",

I was very pleasantly surprised when a friend of mine suggested the place to me and told me the food was good.   Not only are the portions huge, but the prices are very reasonable (especially for lunch). Service is always very friendly and quick, and the servers are incredibly attentive.   Two cons to the place: the decor (outdated, drab, and harsh neon lighting) & the sushi. The taste of the sushi is absolutely fine and is fresh, but its very expensive and the rolls are quite small. It's just odd because all of the other entrees are huge!   All in all, I'll be back to this place for sure.",

I wasn't expecting much--just the usual Americanized Chinese food--but that's not we got here. Granted, my experience was a little unusual.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is quite nice; it's pretty large. A few minutes after we were seated, the owner came by and started talking to my parents. He was very friendly, and recommended a lot of authentic Chinese dishes that weren't on the menu.  In the end, we ordered completely based off his list, which included items such as pork belly with mustard greens () and bok choy (). It was a very satisfying, delicious meal. (However, it was only when the check came that we realized how much more these dishes cost.)  I realize that this was a rarer experience, and that the owner would never have recommended these dishes had we not been Chinese. However, this was the only time I've eaten here, and it was a fantastic dining experience, so I feel that this review should reflect that.",

It comes with an egg roll or soup. The hot and sour and egg drop are both very good. $6.25 for all that.   The Japanese lunch boxes are a good choice, too: they come with a little bit of sushi and a salad. The ginger dressing is unique but tasty.   There are roll specials, too for $10.   If I am feeling opulent, I get the Chinese lunch AND the house vegetable roll a la carte. Or a whole order of General Tso's Tofu from the main menu. I was warned that the tofu was a big order. But it was crispy on the outside, custardy on the inside and tangy good. I ate it all. I am fat.   Free hot tea when you eat in. Once, I saw a server opening a pounder of Coors Light and pouring it for someone at their table. It was 1130AM on a Wednesday.   They have a full bar.",

Where ethnic restaurants are concerned, people frequently confuse the words \"authentic\" with \"delicious.\" Chinese food can be authentic and crappy, authentic and delicious, not authentic and crappy, or not authentic and delicious. This place happens to be the last.  If you're looking for good Chinese cooking, this isn't your place. Chicken feet, tripe, duck tongue soup, fish maw soup, bitter melon, XO sauce, stinky tofu - you won't find them here.  Sweet and sour anything, General Tso's, lo mein, and an assortment of Japanese and Thai dishes - done up exactly the way you like if you're a fan of American Chinese. Delicious!  They do have natto, that's almost worth the trip for me.",

Also, the bathrooms here are dirty, not to mention extremely outdated.  They have so many people working here, I would think one person would be able to scrub the bathrooms down.    Next, the soups here just plain suck.  They seem to put flour in all of their soups, and they are also lacking in flavor.    The sushi however is very good here.  Although, it would be nice to see maybe some sushi specials every once in a while with different \"special\" roll items.

Sometimes the choices are overwhelming, though.   I like sushi, and no matter how much you doll up a roll with sauces and roe, the most important thing is the freshness and quality of the fish. That simply doesn't come across in Taipei Tokyo's food. This restaurant purely exemplifies the two-star \"meh\" review.   The saving grace of Taipei Tokyo are their bento box lunches. Ranging from 8-14 dollars, they have a nice portion of food and includes a soup and salad. Service is nice, but can be slow, especially during the busy lunch hours.

I'm not sure why because there seems to be plenty of people working. I rated the place average. I left an average tip.",

When comparing to other local Chinese places (in order of thier appearence): No hot-tea No refills (or very slow refills.. maybe 1 per visit) Only 1 small bowl of fried noodles no matter if you are eating alone or with 3 friends. Ridiculously long wait for initial service and food. Very small portions - not even a standard lunch sizing.  The food itself (no matter how little of it) wasn't bad and the fried rice was excellent.  We won't be back and will stick with my sometime stale fried noodles at China Palace right down the road.",

The Hawaii 5-0 is a HUGE serving of all kinds of seafood and there is nothing lacking in flavor.  We have had many items from this menu and never been disappointed in portion or flavor.  Sizzling Delight is delightful!  The Hot Pot is one of my favorites.  The only negative here is that they are quite quick.  Quick like super fast, thank you so much, many people waiting for your table, bye-bye.  Not to say that the service isn't very good, it definitely is - just be aware that they are there to get the tickets turned.",

Almost to the point of questioning whether they had massive quantities of food stock piled in the back that they just served when people ordered it.  I know that wasn't the case since I had a special request on one of my sushi rolls, but I still can't believe how quickly our food came.  We visited on a Friday night and the place was packed.  Nearly every table was filled with eager diners.  In the very brief time we were waiting for our food, the server brought noodles and duck sauce and was prompt with our beverage service.  Everything we ordered was fresh and tasty.  The major downfall to me was the size of the sushi rolls.  One of the rolls I ordered was $13 but only had five fairly small pieces.  It was tasty, but compared to other area sushi options, I thought it was a bit steep.  My fiance chose a chinese menu option and was equally pleased with his choice.  It was flavorful and he fared much better with the portion size.  Overall, I enjoyed my dining experience, but in the future, I'll probably stick to my standby of Azon Wok in Plum.",

It was warm, inviting, low music in the background.  The service was exceptional, plates were picked up as soon as you were finished.  For dinner we had pork dried dumplings, Amazing Chicken and fried rice.  Everything was delicious.  They have quirky little sayings on the menu next to each item which we had fun reading.  The Amazon Chicken was sliced chicken in a perfectly seasoned peanut sauce.  We were expecting to have leftovers for lunch, but ended up eating everything.    There are no free refills, but the price of a soda was so low that it didn't matter.  The waiter didn't say one word the entire meal, but for some reason it was fine and gave us something fun to talk about. If this place was in my neighborhood, it would be a weekly stop.",

They are clean and friendly and have a variety of food available for all tastes.  Whether you like chicken, seafood, soup, or sushi, you will find it here my friends. This is a great casual or semi-dressy date night spot or an easy and quick take out- if you call ahead of time. They offer a dimly lit setting and also a bar. I've never eaten or drank at the bar, but it usually seems to fill up pretty quickly with regulars on all nights of the week.  On weekends and during dinnertime this place can get pretty packed. If you prefer a quieter setting with less wait time try coming a little early on a week night.  Plus, I suggest the sesame chicken!",

The reason being is I can get better  tasting and pricing on Chinese takeout elsewhere nearby. So when given my options, I choose the other place. However, my bf loves the general tso's chicken here which is why we have eaten here twice already. The fried rice is decent, a bit more expensive then its competitors. Maybe its the atmosphere? I just prefer not to eat in at a place that is so dim to where I can barely see my food. I am not sure but this place doesn't quite strike a chord with me.",

They also offer some varying Asian cuisine - that looked delicious and was seemingly being enjoyed by other patrons in the restaurant.    While the decor is a little dated, the service is courteous and friendly and the sushi is freshly prepared.  The place even offers some rolls and sashimi not often found elsewhere - so, all in all, there's plenty of variety to meet almost anyone's sushi palate.    From full suits and business outfits to wind pants and t-shirts, this place satisfies a wide range of customers...and does it well!  I'm already looking forward to my next visit...maybe tomorrow:)",

    "text": "This is more of a 3.5 star rating.  We went to Taipei Tokyo after Christmas shopping this past Saturday.  I had been there one other time over two years ago and didn't recall much about what I had or that it was just ok.  Lured by the mention of sushi, I agreed to go again.    It was late by the time we left the mall close to 9:30. However, I checked Yelp and their hours were posted as open until 11pm, Friday and Saturday.   So since they are located only minutes away we continued on.  When we arrived we were promptly seated and given menus but told up front that they close at 10:30.  Not the most welcoming arrival but ok.  I left to use the restroom before sitting down, and when I came out the server was over asking almost immediately what I wanted.  I hadn't even opened the menu yet.  I start looking and about 2 minutes after she had just asked she comes back to ask again.  Ok I know you close in 40 minutes I get it but can I have a minute please?  Matt decides he wants sesame chicken, his famous go to Chinese.  I knew I wanted Sushi or Sashimi but wasn't sure which one.  The price for sushi here does seem a bit high, so I decided to just get an appetizer of sashimi.  Matt had left to use the restroom and again she came over to our table to take our order!  This was a total of 3 times in 5 minutes... Annoyed? yes  So on her trice visit I tell her I think I am ready just a few questions.  This part bothered me more than her rushing our orders, she couldn't really answer ANY of my questions.  I asked what kind of fish is on the sashimi appetizer...um, not sure.  Ok so she asks lady at the bar.  Tuna, salmon, and white fish.  No comment on what kind of white fish.  Ok I will have that.  Second question, your house duck how is that prepared?  I understand there is a bit of a language barrier here but my questions weren't crazy.  Yea she didn't know.  I said is it pan fried, sauteed, deep fried?  Oh deep fried in a pan I am eventually told.  Ok is it cooked to order?  She had no idea what that meant!  Let me translate, can the chef make it the way I want, I want medium rare?  Deer in headlights... She nervously says again how it is cooked and says not it is probably just well done.  Well then no thank you.  I ordered Shrimp Pad Thai, extra spicy.  No sooner does she leave the table she returns with my sashimi, seriously a five second turnaround.  Ok it's raw it doesn't take much to cut up.  The sashimi was very good and fresh, something I will admit I was nervous about.  There were a total of 9 pieces, 3 each of the above mentioned fish.  I was only about half way through when out came our dinners.  This was a total of less than 5 minutes.  Wow...  So the food was overall a solid 4.  My Shrimp Pad Thai had good flavor and a nice portion, while the Mr. loved his chicken, but the service was so in our faces.  She asked us to pay the check almost right after being served stating the registers close at 10pm.  Um ok... then at another point she came over, me mid chewing, and asked me to hand her my empty beer bottle.  No this couldn't wait until I came up for air, she needed to clear our table stat!  It was a bit over the top to say the least.  I ate a little more but we both decided to just get everything to go since it was uncomfortable.    Next time if we decide to visit we will make sure it is several hours before close or for takeout.",

Had hot and sour soup today and pork lo mein. Very tasty. My go to though, because of the vibrant flavors, is the Basil Chicken. And I totally enjoy the Black and Gold roll which has soft shell crab in it.   When you have a taste for this cuisine, be sure to stop in, say hi to Bruce, Heather and Jay and enjoy the food. I always do.",

The restaurant has a relaxed vibe with dim lighting. The hot tea was also really good. They have their own version of yumyum sauce (if you're familiar with other restaurants) however it's an additional fee.  Great spot for lunch!",

My wife got vegetarian fried dumplings and vegetarian pad thai (yes, she is one of those). My appetiser was amazing in taste n texture and the sauce which accompanied it was a show stealer. The roll came out really well in terms of presentation as well as taste. My wife loved her pad thai and veggie dumplings as well. She also had an apple martini which she didn't like much as it was too sweet. All in all, we enjoyed our experience and will definitely come here again.",

Then I ordered a avacado roll. 6 absolutely tiny rolls came back. They were good but the seaweed paper was kinda dry! That was another $5.    I rarely eat everything when I go out but I finished with more room in my stomach after 15 min. They also have lettuce in their veggie sushi roll.. super weird. Lettuce!!??

The staff is really great because they all act like they remember you every time you walk in and they all wave goodbye to you when you leave - it is a warm and welcoming atmosphere. Their chinese food is also really good - i generally order my chinese in the form of take out so that i can sit on my couch and watch netflix while eating it. They pack the take out bags really nicely and the portions are equal, if not greater than they would be when you're dining in.",

I am not a huge spicy dish lover, so curry is definitely out and can't comment. I have had family members order from the beef section and have never had anything negative to say.  Family owned and operated and always present in the restaurant. The service has always been consistently pleasant and accommodating. I have never had a disappointing dining experience here.

Sushi is fresh and served at the perfect temperature.  Not to cold, not to warm - just melting in your mouth.  Just FYI, they use the expensive imitation crab.  If you do not know the difference, then you have not visited enough sushi joints.  Just sayn'  There website is down, so I cannot tell which rolls we ordered.  They were both specialty rolls.  One was the eel topped on with spicy tuna inside.  Both were in the $12-$15 dollar range, I find specialty rolls around that range is pretty across the board.  Therefore, I am not sure why the other Yelpers said the sushi was expensive, also, the rolls were normal size (another Yelper said the rolls were small).  Another Yelper said service was terrible.  Not sure about that, our server was awesome.  The manager came by twice to ask how we are enjoying our meal.  Both the manager and server said thank you on our way out.......     In closing, there is a wide range of reviews, the three bad ones that I mentioned above and others ---- then there is several 4 and 5 stars, I am not sure what is going on with consistency or the place or maybe its the Yelpers, who knows!!!

The entree dinner prices are a bit higher than I would expect from a mall strip location. The portions were a little above average--sharing is harder but definitely enough for one person per dish.   I expected to see more Taiwanese dishes but they are mostly all mainland. The little eateries in Squirrel Hill are a lot more authentic and varied.

They have a nice lunch combo deal that runs every day but Sunday with lots of options.  We opted to split a few rolls of sushi and an appetizer. We chose the seafood cheese wantons to start. They came out quickly with six in an order. They were rather small, but a good way to start.  We also ordered 2 rolls of spicy tuna and the dragon roll. They came out shortly after our appetizer. I am very satisfied with our choices. The tuna rolls were actually fairly spicy which is nice since most places don't make them very spicy. The dragon roll was a nice choice as well though I think we will try something new next time.  Overall nice find. Choose to the convention center, quick service and good food.",

It is just above mid range on flavors. Worth the money but sometimes the fish is just over too fishy. One suggestion I have for everyone is come around 730.Never is slammed but still is steady. You get to miss all the phone orders for pick up.",

The restaurant had a pretty good crowd yet they were on top of everything. 5 stars!!",

But without knowing where to go in Monroeville I went on yelp and with 123 reviews at 4 stars I thought I was safe.   Food quality was the issue. Very bland and thin sauces on the chef specials, pot stickers were over cooked and bland as well, other disappointment was the fried items - chicken from general and egg rolls were fried in seemingly very old oil:(   I am now on my way back out for our second take out of the night as everyone is still hungry!",

As advertised on the menu, the pot had a lobster tail (half a tail - we complained about that), shrimp, mussels, squid, scallops, basil, garlic and ginger sauce. Contrary to the menu the shrimp were medium (not jumbo), the scallops were more like small bay scallops (not sea type as advertised). We complained to Lisa about the tough lobster tail and the tough shrimp. Her response was, the next tell her not to have the lobster tail over cooked.",

My only issue is that there is little lighting and it is kind of dark, perhaps in need of revamping the interior (kind of outdated aesthetics), and their sushi is subpar, but the rest of the menu is great. Lunch menu and its prices are reasonable too. Decent sized restaurant which is good for small get togethers with family and friends, and it's not too loud either.

The staff is quite friendly and the service is good but don't expect anything other than mediocre food. If you're a fan of American Chinese food, you may like the fact that you can get basic sushi here and superfluous rolls that mask the quality of the fish. I prefer to enjoy my fish which is why for me Chaya is the best option in Pittsburgh. One may think it's too much to expect authentic food in Monroeville but  Udipi and The Green Mango prove you can. Taipei Tokyo tries to do too much and should instead concentrate on offering authentic Taiwanese cuisine along with American Chinese favorites for those who are used to their \"Chinese\" food tasting a certain way.",

Granted, mu shu chicken is not the most seasoned dish in the world, but it should taste like something. The shumai appetizer was congealed starch. Chopped shrimp? Not in any of the six pieces. Worst was it was all lukewarm at best. The mu shu pancakes got delivered five minutes after everything else, with many other tables getting served in the meantime.

It use to be no matter what time you got your food, it would always be fresh and tasty. Now, it seems that the food taste best when you get it anytime before dinner. Anything after that can be a hit or miss. There are always generous portions of food and their prices do beat most places. There are a few waitresses there that are kind of rude. And this girl who is always at the front register (she is in charge of take-out orders) is rude sometimes also. Despite some of the not-so-great people, overall, this is one of my favorite restaurants, and it is definitely a place that hits right at home for me. I would recommend the General Tso's chicken, Volcano sushi, green fugi maki sushi, spicy tuna sushi, octopus sashimi, Lions head, any of their rice combinations, and the seaweed salad....pretty much everything! :-)",

I know the male owner of the business who always greets me warmly.  Ordered lunch today and a takeout dinner.  Was surprised by the small portion and even more surprised when I received the bill and was charged for a refill of a fairly small cup of Diet Pepsi. I don't remember being charged for Pepsi refills there and wouldn't expect to be charged at a nicer restaurant for refills.  I told the waitress that I would like the refill charge to be taken off the bill (more on principle than anything).  She refused and sent the owner's wife to the table who preceded to harshly tell me that her restaurant has charged for refills for 18 years. When I asked her to remove the charge, she angrily said that she would but that she didn't like my attitude! I told her that I didn't like her attitude and that she would be losing a long-time costumer over a refill charge. She told me not to come back!  No problem.  I never will.

    "text": "My wife & I have traveled extensively throughout the US of A and we often seek out sushi when we travel.  Even I find it bizarre that Taipei-Tokyo has become our point of reference for sushi, but it is True.  We often concur that our neighborhood sushi is better than what we are finding on the road.  Not that they are perfect here, but on most nights, and we eat there often, the sushi melts in your mouth, doesn't fall apart, isn't so large that it would choke a horse,  and has great taste.  We haven't been to Umi in a while, but we always thought them to be the best in the 'burgh, but for the price difference, we are more than happy with Taipei-Tokyo.  We also enjoy the spicy Chinese food here.  The (non-authentic Chinese) General Tso's  here is wonderful.  Throw in the friendly staff and owners, and we rarely leave here without a smile on our faces and  content bellies full of satisfying food.  Of course, a half hour later we're hungry, but .......",

Hey, when you snag a parking spot in front of the door, losing it is not an option.  The owners are sweet with a freaky memory.  To this day, I could probably walk in and he would recognize me and make a joke about how I would always get delivery (not to mention what I ordered).  The staff is also quite friendly and attentive.  If Zu still works there, tip him well as he is a riot.  The General Tso's is quite good although I always asked for well done and extra sauce.  They have a few other decent dishes although since I have not lived there for almost 2 years, my memory is hazy.  Unless things have changed, I would avoid the sushi as it's not the freshest you can find.  Overall, it's standard (but tasty) Americanized Chinese food with a few traditional dishes thrown in for good measure.  It's pricing is on par with other places but they have terrific lunch specials as well.",

    "text": "This place really is a hidden gem for Monroeville.  It probably wouldn't stack up too well in most other cities, but for here it's worth your trip.  Especially, for sushi in the suburbs.  I took some members of my team there today and I decided not to order sushi like usual, but try some of their \"chinese\" food offerings.  It's located in a strip mall like many of the finest chinese/japanese places are and it was packed with many native folks.  There were more people here today of east asian descent than american (a good sign), incidentally took the team to El Campesino in Monroeville yesterday and again, more mexican than americans.  The interior is nice enough with roomy seating a small bar in the front and a small sushi bar in the back.  This place is the best sushi in Monroeville (although saying that is like saying being the valedictorian at Hill District High School), anyways.. They keep this place really dark.  I don't mind this, but during the day when you step outside it's like you are leaving the cinema.  The service is excellent.  I'd say maybe even 4 stars.  I'm always impressed when we go here how attentive without being intrusive they are.  We sampled a lot of things.  One person tried the barbecue spare ribs which were a good size and didn't taste like they were under the sunlamp too long, but overall lacked much flavor.  Another tried the \"dynamite\" roll which is a very americanized version of a sushi roll.  It's basically a california roll with diced imitation crab warmed up with some cream based sauce put on top.  I didn't really care for this.  I think it would have been much better without the gooey sauce and if the \"crab\" on top was cold and spicier.  I tried the egg drop soup which was relatively bland.  We also sampled the szechuan (sp?) scallops which were quite good and cooked perfectly with a delicious brown sauce.  I had the lamb with barbecue sauce which was a lot of really tender perfectly cooked lamb in a nice sauce.  Some others tried the General Tso's and Kung Pao which were very acceptable.   If you are into Americanized Chinese and you are in the suburbs you could do a lot worse than this place.  The ingredients are fresh.  The food is cooked well.  The service is great and the price is reasonable.  One last thing, they are more than happy to customize your order if you don't like certain things or want others added.  This place should probably get 3 1/2 stars.",

It has salmon, eel, salmon crunch, cream cheese, seaweed salad and tuna IN IT and it all sits on some crazy sauce that they thought up...which is amazing. The only thing I can compare it to is if you mix hot mustard and sweet and sour sauce together (which is great by the way). It's not that, but close. It's pretty spicy but with some awesome sweetness and I can't say enough about the creativity on this.   I also had shrimp and vegetables which were what you would expect, but really fresh. I tried some different sushi last night as well as Pad Thai and loved everything. Since I have several more trips out this way I will be visiting again real soon.   It may look cheesy and sit in a strip mall, but everyone there is extremely friendly and the food is outstanding.",

Opened the menu and noticed the prices were a little steep but still gave them a try. We ordered vegetable rolls as an appetizer and the orange chicken and the amazing chicken for our dinner entree. We wanted to have some vegetables with our entrees and the waitress told us it was an extra $3 with the orange chicken so my wife ordered that. We get our food and the vegetables we got was 3 small pieces of broccoli and a few pieces of onions and less carrots... $1 per broccoli... RIDICULOUS!!! The orange chicken was very good but for $12.95 for such a small portion left a bad taste in my mouth! The amazing chicken was not amazing at all. They should really rethink the name of that dish. After we were done, the waitress asked us if we still wanted the vegetable roll appetizer and of course our answer was no. There are other good chinese restaurants around. I would never ever go back nor would i recommend this place to any of my family or friends.",

If you're looking for a good time, go by yourself or with just one other person and sit at the bar, even if you're not drinking. The bartenders are the friendliest, most attentive bartenders around. Listen to the conversations-- there is such an array of interesting people. I've been a regular here on and off for at least 8 years, and I still meet new people who can share a good story over a Sapporo or sake.   Oh hey, they have food too! The sushi is in my opinion the best in Pittsburgh. The fish is always fresh. I've met people from as far as Nebraska and California who say that when they come to Pittsburgh, they always come to Taipei because it has the best around. I'll just have to take their word. There is a variety of interesting rolls, as well as the traditional maki and nigiri. There is a good blend of Chinese/Taiwanese and Japanese food, with a few things like pad thai sprinkled in. The price is definitely reasonable, especially because the restaurant has a great, relaxed ambiance that surpasses a lot of the higher-end Asian food places in Pittsburgh. It's open a little later than your average dinner place, too, so it's nice to hit up around 9 when some of the other places are closing. It's definitely worth a drive out to Monroeville sometime.",
