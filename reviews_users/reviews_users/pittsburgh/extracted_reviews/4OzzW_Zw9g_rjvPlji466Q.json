    "text": "This is a great addition to 8th ave in homestead. They were working out some kinks with some previous staff but it seems like things are falling into place for them! I had the fish tacos, and coming from Southern California I'd say these were pretty delicious fish tacos. The coconut flakes and mango were a really nice add on. The folks we were with had the steak which they really enjoyed, the mac'n cheese was also delicious, but very filling, and the CBLT also got 2 thumbs up. They had a decent wine selection, great beers on draft, and I had the manhattan which was fantastic!!  The interior of the place is also really great. It's got a modern feel but it's not super hipster. It fits nicely with the area! Go here for a night out, after shopping at the waterfront, or to watch a game.   *there could be a few more vegetarian options, which they are working on. If that's your thing, go with the fries. They were awesome!!",

Candied Bacon, Brussel sprout, and Tomato sandwich. It's on ciabatta bread and comes with frites and a garlic parm aioli. One of the best sandwiches I've had in Pittsburgh! My husband had the mussels. They were fresh, well cooked and in a delicious sauce. I wish we had more time to experience the homemade ice cream and gelato. However, it's the prefect excuse to go back!",

I wish we would have continued walking a few more storefronts down the road. I wasn't impressed with Honest Johns. They ran out of coffee cream so milk was put in the creamer. Immediately could tell it wasn't cream by the color my coffee turned. I told the waiter I didn't want the coffee but was still charged for it. The bacon was more fat than meat. Had an awful taste. The kicker was the bus boy who's pants were so low(below his ass) all you could see was his yellow underwear. That's not what I want to see when I go out to eat. Will not be back.",

    "text": "For those of you familiar with the area, this restaurant is in the same location where Tin Front Cafe used to be.  The restaurant is not affiliated with Tin Front Cafe, and has a totally different vibe.  It is much bigger than Tin Front because it also incorporates the store that used to be next door. They still have the great outdoor area which will be awesome in the warmer months. One of the first things that stood out was that this restaurant/bar is partitioned into three rooms.  Upon entering the two rooms separate from the bar, you could tell a substantial decrease in the noise level from the bar and TVs.  It was a classy and dimly lit, allowing for a much more intimate setting.  On today's visit, I stayed at the bar.    Their menu is not your typical bar fare.  I got some wings and a burger, which sounds typical enough, but my wings were habanero orange - a nice blend of heat (but not too much) and citrus sweetness. They also were not your typical breaded wings.  They were fried without a coating, which led to a very crispy skin.  My burger (which I ordered medium) was cooked properly, and was a nice thick, juicy chuck patty.  It was topped with friend onions, a tomato compote, mixed greens and cheddar cheese. Very tasty.  The fries that came with it were also great.  Crunchy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and seasoned with salt and pepper.  The drinks are what stood out the most.  There aren't a ton of beers on tap - I think that there were 7 or eight - but the ones that they did have were solid options.  But where their drinks are different is in the large selection of cocktails, mules, and wines.  I had a Homestead Mule consisting of whisky, ginger beer and an orange slice.  Very refreshing, tasty, and served in an ice cold copper mule mug.  On top of that, service was great - extremely friendly staff and owner, who came by to chat and introduce himself.  This is definitely a solid addition to the growing Homestead bar/restaurant scene, and one that has its own distinct identity among them.  If you are looking for a place with a huge number of draft beers on tap, then this is probably not your best bet in Homestead.  I would try either Dukes, Blue Dust or Dorothy 6.  But if you are more of a foodie looking for an upscale bar, that can also provide an intimate dining experience with a lot of drink options - Honest John's is a great choice.  Definitely work checking out, especially if you happen to be shopping at the Waterfront.",

Ordered the Pumpkin Hummus starter, which was just Ok, as the tortilla chips were deep fried crispy but tasted greasy of the oil they were cooked in and this overwhelmed any of the flavors within the hummus and made the appetizer feel heavy on the stomach I feel  that lightly toasted or grilled Pita bread slices would have been a better option. Main course big eats were good however and more than made up for the appetizer shortcomings. We shared an Italian hot sausage sandwich that came with arugula and in a ciabbata bun. The other shared entree was the short rib tacos with pickled radish. Both entrees we ordered with the frites and were both delicious and flavorful. Will be back to sample other items on the menu",

    "text": "We were looking for a place to eat before a concert at Carnegie Music Hall a few blocks away and came across Honest John's. We just made Happy Hour which was $2 off draft beer.   We started with the Frites for an app. They were good, I'm a fan of thicker cut fries but the seasonings were good and the dipping sauce went well with it. I had the mussels for my entree, even though it is listed as a starter it was more than enough. The broth was insanely good and I could eat it like soup. My fiance got the burger which he ate faster than I ate 3 mussels. Our waitress was great too, very attentive and wasn't annoyed by my questions about the menu.   The only downfalls for me was it seemed a bit overpriced and the location is still not the best, even with several new spots opening up near by. We were followed right when we stepped out of the restaurant by someone who wouldn't accept that we didn't have cash on us. He didn't leave us alone until we entered Voodoo a block away. I think it will get better over time and I hope this place can stick it out.",

    "text": "My best friend and I get together every few months to try new restaurants around the city. We had plans to see Andy Grammer at the nearby music hall so she suggested we try dinner at this place. We love exploring the happy hour at the new places we try.  When we arrived we fully expected a happy hour menu, since happy hour is listed on the website. They had an okay selection of drinks, but no food selections at all. It's not even an option. Since we both have a fairly tight budget and we already had plans that evening, the main menu prices seemed a bit steep to us. To play it safe we both ordered a quesadilla. It was DELICIOUS!!! Possibly one of the best quesadillas I've ever had. But it was soooooo small. We spent $13 each on a quesadilla that was gone in a matter of just a few minutes. Each piece was about the size of a tortilla chip. In fact, we were both still hungry when we finished. Since there weren't any cheap options on the menu, we left and got something in a nearby drive thru. I gave this place 4 stars because the food was deserving of a whole lot more, but the portion size for the price was disappointing. And for the location of the restaurant at that. My friend used the term \"boujee\". And I'd say that's about right. But hey, I really do hope they stay around. Because they really have great potential.",

The neighborhood is still trying to turn the corner but don't let that stop you. I came in for lunch and was blown away. It's an older building so the seating is kind of odd but let's skip that. The cocktails were as solid as can be. I had a Jalepeno margarita and then switched to a bourbon cocktail and they were both perfect. We had the quesidilla for a starter and it was really savory! Nice starer portion and the flavor profile was perfect. The server was awesome And told us a little bit about the place. Made a great cocktail also so server /bartender! We Also tried the deviled eggs. Now I'm not a big fan if deviled eggs but I ate a couple so if you like deviled eggs give them a try.  The main lunch course did not disappoint and the flavors we're again excellent with good portions. This is a place you have to try if you are anywhere close it adventurous enough to go out and find it. The movies are close, so is Costco, Dave and Buster's and other shopping so make it an afternoon!",

I certainly do not but unfortunately that was the reality with the 3 slices of French toast I got for my meal for $11.  Note to restaurant: if you want to stay in business you need to add a small side to the brunch entrees-a few pieces of fruit, toast, home fries, something.  The food was so delicious and perfectly presented but left you wanting more.  I love the decor of this place and the staff was very friendly. The service was slow-it took forever for our orders to come out and they brought out 3 out of the 6 orders first then about 10  minutes later the next 3.  Not a great practice.  I really hope they improve upon their brunch as it has great potential.",

    "text": "My only complaint about Honest John's is I wish they were open more. :)   I've had the brussel spouts and mussels from the appetizer menu. Both were fantastic. I highly recommend the spouts. I can see myself making a meal of them many times over in the future. The mussels were also a stand out with a delicious broth and chunks of jalapeno chicken sausage. Yummy.  From the mains I've had the burger, fish tacos and pastrami sandwich. The burger was perfectly cooked to order. The fish tacos were filled with chunks of blackened tilapia filets, not the breaded strips most other places use. Delicious. The pastrami was good, but it wasn't my favorite honestly. The pickled onions on the sandwich were missing some zing and the pumpernickel bread wasn't thick enough to hold up to all the liquid from the sauce and onions. It was still a tasty sandwich but it quickly became a bit of a mess to eat with one's hands.   So far I've had the lobster bisque and garden vegetable soups. The bisque came with notably large chunks of lobster and was about the best I've had outside of a coastal region. It was fantastic. The soup offerings rotate, so if it's in the rotation, definitely get it! The vegetable was good. It starts off a little sweet and as you continue to eat a black pepper bite builds on your tongue. I'd have preferred less sweetness but it was still enjoyable with large chunks of veggies, many of which you usually don't see in a typical veggie soup.  They have 2 offering for fries: battered potato and sweet potato. Generally I'm not a fan of the battered fries because they come out soggy/mushy at most places. At John's they've been spot on crunchy every time. But the sweet potato fries are really where it's at. The menu description gave me the impression they'd be cloyingly sweet and I almost didn't get them. Man am I glad I went for it. The fries were perfect and the maple bourbon dipping sauce was phenomenal! I would order them by themselves, they were just that damn good. I found myself continuing to pick at them long after I reached full on food coma bloat. So good.  The staff is great. Friendly and competent, it's the kind of place where if you walk away unhappy, it's your own fault. These people will jump through hoops to satisfy you, all you need do is speak up. On every visit, I've seen the owner and chef, walk through the restaurant checking with customers to make certain they are happy with their food. Seriously, you can't beat that.  I'm a fan...in a big way...and plan to visit this spot frequently. Honest John's is a very welcome addition to Homestead.",

    "text": "Honest John's is definitely the best place to eat in the Waterfront area; the food quality and value for your money is excellent. The decor is welcoming, there is an outdoor patio and the tables are well spaced out which is fairly rare in Pittsburgh. It also isn't crazy loud so you an have a conversation.  The menu is small but there is a little bit of everything and the portions are a little bit larger than standard. I really liked the breads and spreads tray but wish they had maybe more of a variety of breads. We have also tried:  ceviche - very good mussels/sausage app - this could be a meal in itself, great broth pastrami - great ingredients/bread sweet potato fries - these were perfect, crisp and came with a delicious dipping sauce  Server was great, there was a bit of a wait for the food but I think their kitchen is really small so that can't really be helped. She kept us informed of the delay and the owner was there both times keeping an eye on things. Most dinner items are in the $12-$15 range with a few outliers so I would say this is the price range of TGI Fridays/Rock Bottom.   Anyway, I will likely be a repeat customer and really enjoyed my experience so check them out if you are looking for a meal in the Waterfront or Homestead area.",

    "text": "Just to be honest with you...  Honest John's is looking like it's going to be a very nice bar/restaurant in the Pittsburgh area.  The wife and I were having brunch a few doors down but heard about this place and wanted to have a few drinks to see if we would like to come back for brunch or dinner another day.   When we walked in it was about 230pm and they close on Sundays at 3.  A lot of times you get an evil eye when you walk into a restaurant right before they are closing but they didn't here.  The bartender was nice and asked if we wanted brunch or just drinks and we told her just drinks.          Looking around you can see that the restaurant looks very nice and still new looking.  We liked the colors of the floors and the bar area was very appealing.       So we sat at the bar and ordered some drinks.  Carrie got Irish coffee that was really good.  They put Baileys and Jameson in it just the way she likes it.  I just got a Sam Adams Cold Snap.       Looking around we saw that they have a nice patio outside.  It was too cold to check it out but it's something that we would like to come back and try in the summer.         Another couple came in about 15 minutes before they closed and they were able to get brunch still which was nice to see.  We both were here past 3 and the bartender told us to take our time and we did LoL.  We had a nice time there and we got to check out heir dinner/brunch menu too.  We both had another drink and just had a good time here        This place is definitely a place you need to check out to be honest with you!  We got really good service, I's a nice atmosphere, and I'm looking forward to try their food in the near future.",

    "text": "I gotta give this place props for plopping down in the middle of Homestead and making a go of it.  They have a lot of potential and I really hope they make it.   For starters, the space is really pretty.  They did a great job with the decor, which is a modern rustic theme.  Happy hour specials were pretty broad - something for everyone.  We ate at the bar and everyone there was super friendly and they all looked to get along very well.     The food was good, but not spectacular - a solid base to start with though.  We sampled the breads and spreads.  I really liked some of it and didn't love some of it. The black garlic was a lot more bitter than I'd anticipated and the raisin bread was sort of stale, but there was a goat cheese spread and a sweet potato spread that I could have eaten a vat of.   My entre was the short rib quesadilla.  Again, it was good and I enjoyed it, but it seemed like it was missing something.  A few tweaks and the food could really be great and I think they'll get it right once they have some more regular clientele and a little more rhythm.  On the night I went, the place was fairly empty except for a big group of the owner's family.",

    "text": "Update: The mark of a great restaurant is an owner who cares. I received a message shortly after the review below confirming that sides will be added to orders, and a changing table will be installed. Way to go, Honest John!  Honest John's interior decorator deserves 5 stars. Love, love, the decor. The brunch menu, while not incredibly big, is also solid. I order the DIY Omelette with almost every \"topping\" option. A few of the items I chose were missing, but it took a decent amount of time to receive our food, and I was starving, so I ate it anyway. It was delicious! I expected it to come with toast or something, but it was just an omelette on a plate. For $11, that's borderline too expensive for just an omelette IMO. I also ordered a side of homefries for $3, which were equally good. Two other things...  While our server was pleasant enough, service was slow. Granted, we had a party of six, but the party of three beside us also seemed to experience excessive wait times as well.  In my 3 short months as a parent this is the first restaurant I've encountered without a changing table. Even though it's been only 3 months, we go out a LOT, so it's interesting that this is the first time this has happened. I sort of just stood there, and after a bit of thought, decided to use my portable changing pad on the entryway bench. Sorry 'bout that, but I didn't want to do it at the table, and wasn't sure what else I could do. Unfortunately, I think this means I won't be dining at HJ's until my baby Yelper is out of diapers, or I fly solo. All things considered about the experience, it's probably going to be the former to give them a bit more time to work out what's sure to be a great restaurant someday!",

    "text": "Yea for Homestead! Was actually in my way to another place and Honest John's completely caught my eye. It's bright finish to a dim 8th ave is just what this street needs. The decor is simple and clean. Love the bar area and there is outdoor seating! Yes, outdoor seating!!! Can't wait to see that once the cold winter goes.   I started with the Blue Steel which is a simple vodka martini with bleu cheese stuffed olives. Comes in a metal martini glass which is a nice touch. The olives are not your store bought, pre-stuffed. Hand stuffed which makes the cheese a nice treat. So many different drinks on the menu to try...large selection of Mules, beers, wine and cocktail specials.   My friend and I chose the breads and spreads 5 choice option. Loved the roasted black garlic. It is pungent, but great. We also had the tapenade, bone marrow butter, goat cheese and anchovy caper. Served with a selection of toasted pita chips, focaccia and raisin bread. Excellent!  I chose the appetizer serving of the mussels. Thank goodness because the entree would have been way too much after the breads.  Sooo good. Topped with chicken sausage and sweet peppers and cubed focaccia. The broth was tasty! My friend had the wings and I tried a bite. Great sauce and sizable half pound portion.   The owner, \"Honest John\" was there to chat with us     I'm looking forward to returning to try more on the menu and see the happy hour specials.   Honestly...great.",

    "text": "Sometimes you end up somewhere that you weren't planning on going and are so glad you did.  I was not aware of Honest John's until my friend and I parked right in front of it.  Always wanting to support Homestead businesses we decided to go in and have a drink and check it out.  And ended up staying for dinner!  Very cool layout and decor.  The sleek bar is in the center of the establishment, with a dining room to your left, and another dining area past the bar in the main area.  And, when the weather finally breaks, they have a great little patio for dining outdoors.  Nice selection of specialty cocktails along with several Moscow Mules.  I had \"The Homestead\" which was perfect for a cool night, a great mix of whiskey, ginger beer and an orange.  My friend and I could not help but to choose the breads and spreads plate where you can pick either three or five different cheese/spreads which is accompanied with several different breads.  My favorite was the goat cheese, which actually went pretty well with the garlic spread.  It can't hurt to mix things up a little!  For my meal I chose a half pound of wings with the BBQ sauce.  A half pound ends up being about 6 full sized wings.  The sauce, while plentiful (and messy), was really good!  You'll need several napkins for this, but certainly worth the sticky fingers.  My friend ordered the appetizer portion of the muscles, and it was definitely a large portion that served as a dinner portion.    The owner, John, was at the bar area and introduced himself to us.  He talked about the menu and ideas for happy hour specials.  The staff was all very attentive and friendly.  Honest John's is a fantastic addition to 8th Avenue and I can wait to bring my brunch club here for....drum roll please...brunch!",

It services an area of Pittsburgh that for years has been lacking in fine dining options, and you can tell that the owner is passionate, hardworking, and determined that his guests have a great experience. The food is top notch and the drinks are also reasonably priced and delicious. The mussels are a must, my Girlfriend got a to go container just for the cream sauce that accompanied them. I got the Honest John burger which was Fantastic, the shoestring fries were also very good. My Gf had the ricotta ravioli' and she said they were amazing. The service started off a little lackadaisical, however, got better as the experience drew on. All in all, I would highly recommend Honest Johns, it's definitely a memorable meal.",

On a warm summer's eve we sat in the shaded patio and delighted in the Ravioli entre and Watermelon Feta Salad w Chicken we shared. Superb. The Ravioli was creamy, light, with touches of sweet, salty and savory. The watermelon was sweet, sour and summer perfect. We finished with the warm lemmon cake, gelato, and lemon curd proving why it is so popular. The staff was great, making up for a minor delay in taking our order with complimentary cocktails and many apologies. The cocktails -- a classic Manhattan and a made-up-on-the spot Bourbon Mule by their outstanding bartender were delicious. And the price point would make jaws drop in cities where this kind of cuisine and drink would of cost twice as much. Honest John's is a great Pittsburgh restaurant and easy to reach just across the Mon from the East End.",

They close at 3:00 on Sundays and we didn't arrive until about 2:30.  Now lots of places would be a little annoyed at our late appearance or just inform us that we can only get drinks cause they close at 3, but no the bartender warmly asked if we were doing brunch, drinks, or both.  That was very nice not getting a stink eye for the late arrival.    We settled on some drinks and soaked in the atmosphere which was lovely done with a very modern and contemporary feel.  Everything looked new and clean and we noticed an outdoor area in the back which would be perfect for the warmer months.  We did ask for a menu just see what they offered and were quite pleased at the selection making note that we should return for a True dining experience.     I ordered an Irish coffee and True to my experience with Irish coffee's she made it with Jamison and Baileys and even asked if I wanted the whipped cream.  Take notice, I am not a bartender having only played one on TV, but this is how an Irish coffee is done.  It was the perfect warm boozy blend I needed for this particularly cold Sunday.    We didn't wrap up until after 3, and they were not rushing us out the door.  Very nice staff, love the atmosphere, and my drink hit the spot.  I hope to eat here soon so I can write a food review, but if the food is as good as the rest it will be a winner.",

There was no one else there, but it took 35 minutes to get our food, and we all ordered sandwiches.   Several of my friends ordered the muffuleta sandwich which was served cold, despite the bread being toasted - yes, the bread was cold too. Which makes me suspect they had it in the fridge and warmed it up.   Another friend ordered the BLT, and they straight up forgot the Bacon. It was just an LT. We complained and they brought us some bacon on the side, but this is not a mistake that should happen when we are the ONLY customers in the place. They still charged us for the BLT, too.  The server was friendly enough, but the food just wasn't that tasty. I ordered the burger, and didn't finish it or the fries, and I normally clean my plate of those two items in particular. The fries were very basic; if someone said they were from the freezer I wouldn't be surprised. To quote a friend \"the Panera Bread version of this sandwich tastes better\".  Not sure at all where all the good reviews came from on this place.",

The second time we visited we brought our family (8 people) . We didn't have reservations and it was packed. We tried to make other arrangements elsewhere but John stopped us and ensured that he would make it work. And lucky for us it did. We noticed they brought in tables from outside to make it work. We had an amazing meal despite it being packed and we all decided we would be back again.",

    "text": "I stumbled upon this restaurant after a day where everything was going wrong, so I admit, I was vulnerable and needed my food to hug my soul. I had never seen or heard of this place but the name greeted me with the warmth I needed, so I went inside. I was greeted by friendly staff and took a seat at the bar.   The bartender took my drink order and gave me a menu. I was in the mood for something healthy and protein packed. I started with the horseradish deviled eggs with candied bacon and chives. Holy hot damn, these were very literally the best deviled eggs I've ever eaten. Trust me when I say this is not hyperbole. The balance of sweet and savory with the added bite from the horseradish was like a divine trinity in my mouth.   For my main dish, I ordered the baby lettuces salad. Get this, it had baby lettuces, (of course) a dijon-balsamic vinaigrette, bruleed goat cheese, dried apricots, candied pecans, and was topped with grilled chicken. In case you don't know, let me explain what bruleed goat cheese is. Its a creamy round of goat cheese with a toasted, carmelized shell. If you are new to bruleed goat cheese, like I was, imagine if baby Jesus, the Dalai Lama, a unicorn, and Betty White got together to formulate the best way to eat a round of goat cheese. That's what this tasted like. Pure, Zen, magical truth that never goes out of style. Naturally, everything else on the salad was pretty much gravy. Not literally people. There was no gravy on the salad. Just perfectly balanced flavors, and a dressing to bring it home.   The bartender was super down to earth and friendly, too!",

Had great drinks (really loved the Ginberry and Honest 75 with Cava) - and the food was so wonderful. We had ciabatta starter, and the butter with rosemary was seriously delicious - then split the chicken with goat cheese and spinach, and the CBBT(candied Brussels sprouts bacon sandwich) ; the chicken was amazing , tasty, and spinach was cooked so well... but that sandwich. Omg that sandwich was unreal. Full of flavor, did NOT skimp on quality OR quantity of ingredients.. loved it. Going back for it again. and finally to top it all  off, the staff was simply so wonderful. such a pleasure. A True Pittsburgh gem full of delicious American New style food and fabulous, friendly, welcoming staff. We could've stayed all night to drink and talk with everyone eating drinking and working there tonight. Great time. Will be back!! Can't wait to try the Ricotta Dumplings next!",

Then had a coffee cocktail which was so entertaining seeming them make it.  I had the ricotta dumplings which were so lemony and light tasting.

While I found it to be a little small for a party space, the service was excellent on both occasions, with good food and comfortable ambiance.  The brunch options were plentiful and diverse. My sister chose to indulge in only the lemon cake, and cleaned her plate (which is rare for this picky 17 year old), while the rest of us tried the scrambles. I had the ratatouille and it was filling and flavorful. Additionally, we enjoyed the deviled eggs - though the flavor of the horseradish was definitely apparent, contrary to what our server said, so just be forewarned. They're still def delicious! We enjoyed the privacy and shade of the back patio, and are definitely looking forward to our next visit!",

    "text": "I stopped in here for lunch after doing some shopping. During the day the left entrance is locked for security reasons so I entered on the right.  I was greeted warmly and told I could sit anywhere I liked. Mostly table seating having a cloth napkin was a nice touch. A waitress took the time to go over the menu with me. All of their food is made in house fresh and as I will note the results paid off.  I was contemplating the small plate Brussel sprouts but my waitress explained that while it is made for sharing it wouldn't be enough for a lunch. The sandwiches come with either a choice of fries or small salad. For $1.00 upcharge you can get \"frites\" which are basically French fries doctored up with other things.  I decided to go with the beet salad with pistachios and tahini sauce. If you order it without meat then it is one of their few vegan dishes available. I decided to go with grilled chicken with it. In the bar area I was loved looking at the giant size hanging scrabble game. Wasn't sure if it was real to play but it added to the motif.  Sitting directly behind me were wooden high chairs for infants and toddlers. Although this has a full bar and wine list in the room I entered on the right they can accommodate families. I did not see a children's menu nor did a pursue it.  My waitress brought me some freshly brewed ice tea along with my salad and a glass of ice since it was still slightly warm. The salad was very good. It had a bit of a spicy taste to it but not overwhelming. The chicken was fresh and easy to cut with the cutting knife that came with it.  It was a very filling salad and healthy to boot.  This is a very good place to enjoy a meal compared to the dining options that sit in the Waterfront since the food is quality and fairly priced. It is an easy drive to 8th Ave as well.  Located on East 8th Ave in Homestead, inexpensive metered street parking is available. Definitely a must return for me!",

    "text": "Wow!  An unassuming area of Homestead is  Honest John's. On E. 8th Ave.  you will find parking.  Close to the Carnegie Music Hall for a before or after performance meal or drink. As I type this review my tongue is nicely warm from the delicious short rib tacos. Three are In the order with a side.    The decor is clean and inviting. Bar with a few tables and separate dining area.  Our bartender and owner \"John\" gave intimate details on the menu   His recommendation of the Brussels sprouts did not disappoint.  The menu offerings are interesting and not too many. Personally I prefer a small menu, as it is best to do a few things well than a lot of items mediocre.",

Split the Short Rib tacos and grilled romaine salad with someone and both were very good.  The short ribs had a sweet soy flavor with a jalapeno, cilantro and chili crema.  The romaine salad was grilled perfectly and very tasty with some sweet almonds, parmesan and a vinaigrette dressing.",

We started with the deviled eggs (always a winner - little zesty) and beet salad (love the tahini yogurt sauce and pistachios). We both got the ricotta dumplings - so good.  Spinach cooked perfectly with butter and garlic. Mushrooms perfect and a good portion of fantastic dumplings.  Dessert? Of course.  I had the chai spiced cake with ice cream - warm and spicy. Also has the flourless chocolate cake - also warm and just the perfect way to end a great dinner.  Wait staff is great and I think even the owner came over to see how we liked everything.  Always a nice touch .",

I'd read about this place & like the other new spots that have popped up in this area, I was looking forward to trying it. I stopped in on a slow January Wed with my sister-in-law who was visiting from TN. I loved the look & feel of the place immediately. Updated feel with original character of the old building it once was. We were greeted immediately by the female bartender who was quite friendly & accommodating throughout our 2 hour visit. We sat at the bar, but there were regular tables with a divider wall on the other side. I loved their giant Scrabble board on the wall. My SIL had a Bloody Mary & I had one of the IPA's on tap. We shared a delicious, large Brussels sprouts appetizer and I had a burger & she had Caesar salad. There was no wait for food since by the time we ordered we were the only ones in the place. I'd definitely stop back if I were in the area. Looks like they have a small patio out back for summer as well.",

Everyone I went with loved their meal. Generous portions plated beautifully at a fair price. The chef's obviously take pride in their work. They told me it took 24 hours to prepare the pork I had on my special! So good!!! The wait staff was friendly and shared a few laughs with our table.  The birthday girl was pleased as punch. Just loved the tasteful, well thought out decor and was especially impressed with hand crafted reclaimed wood table tops. I also liked how the bar is separated from the dining area with windows so you can have a meal with good conversation and still catch the action on the bar side.  Scrabble fans will love the large wall mounted board with magnetic letters by the bar. I plan to go back and play a round, have round and also to try the Eggs Benedict for Sunday Brunch.",

    "text": "Incredibly disappointing. I came here for Sunday brunch on the strength of the reviews and came away disappointed. Honest John is not ready for prime time. The service was slow (and not great), the food was average (we returned one of the entrees we ordered) and what I assume was Honest John (he was wearing a T-shirt with Honest John emblazoned across the front of it) did not come over once to say hello. For a restaurant that's just getting started and trying to get traction) I found that surprising to say the least. I won't be back and I don't recommend it.",
