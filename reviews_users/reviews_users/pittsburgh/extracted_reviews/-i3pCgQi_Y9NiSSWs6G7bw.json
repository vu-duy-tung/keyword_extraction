The sauces (I tried red & hot) were overly seasoned & grainy.  Basically the experience was like eating herbs and spices on mystery protein.  Perhaps they had a bad day.  The place is close to my home, so I'll give them a second chance.  I didn't have any sides...will have to try them next time.",

And this is authentic GEORGIAN smoked barbecue, not the stuff from Kansas and Texas slathered in red sauce and fat. The pulled pork and beef brisquet -- next time I'm going for the smoked tofu block --  arrive warm and moist in oven-friendly tin pans - yet sauce-less because the cool variety of flavors and types are presented on the side - the party folks loved to experiment this way. The meats are accompanied by two sides - they arrive warm in plastic containers for easy transport with tin pans on the side should re-heating be necessary. Although the greens and beans are to die for, the coup d'grace is the \"Chilli-Q\". Trust me, this is yum yum yummy. For a party crowd this summer, order two meats and two sides, make your own cornbread/coleslaw/macsalad the night before, and share a fabulous no-mess easy cleanup finger licking dining experience. You are sure to repeat such easy entertaining endeavors!",

    "text": "I was craving BBQ tonight specifically brisket, so I rounded up my wife and dad. I Decided on this place, not a very good choice..   The meat was cooked very well, it was juicy and tender. But had very little flavor.  Not sure what this place is thinking about their homemade sauces  taste like someone just mixed a few things up so they could call it there own homemade blend.   The owner was very very nice but definitely needs to work on making new sauces or my suggestion in this case buy some store brand stuff even just to keep as an option for people (we would have taken that instead).   THE next final kicker was the portion size I got the big combo platter for $28 for my wife and I...it only came with 3 ribs, a small leg, about 3-4 slices of brisket ( barely enough to make a sandwich) , and the pulled pork was tender and juicy but barely enough to make a sandwich).   So very overpriced it was like a kiddie sampler plate at the full grown up price.  Plus good thing I ate there half my order was missing. My hotel is 30 min. away imagine getting home and only having half of your baby meal!  I feel bad to say this but all the great reviews here probably never have had real great BBQ. Well I will continue to search Pittsburgh for good BBQ during my 2 month stay.",

Everything is smoked to tender perfection, all three of the sauces are delectable (I'm partial to the mustard), and the cole slaw may be my desert island food of choice (I'm a slaw fiend).  It's really clear that they care about the food here.  I've sampled the brisket, the ribs, the chicken, the pulled pork, and all of the sides.  The only thing that fell a little flat was the mac & cheese -- which has a lot of nice black pepper, but is a little dry.  But everything else is amazing.    The staff is really friendly.  It's mostly a takeout joint currently, and would be well served with some bar stools in the seating area (stand up dining only)...but don't let the location and ambience dissuade you...this is the real deal.  Great food, reasonable prices...Pittsburgh needs more places like this.",

We all moved here from out of state and got a kick out of how accurate it seemed to describe Pittsburgh haha.   My boyfriend got the pulled pork sliders and a friend and I split the half rack of ribs and a large mac n cheese. We got a selection of sauces, the mustard based, signature, and spicy signature. The sauces were phenomenal! If they sold it bottled I would've taken it home! We're all BBQ (sauce) snobs but this was delicious. The Mac n Cheese was my favorite. I would even stop there to pick some up as a side to dinner elsewhere (its THAT good). We could have definitely ate a half rack each so don't fool yourself getting the 1/4 rack. The meat was tender and the dry rub was excellent. I didn't try the pork because my boyfriend inhaled it but it smelled awesome.   Richard, the owner, was very friendly and even came out to chat us up while we chowed down. His wife and sister were also extremely friendly and we learned all about how they started, where they were from, and plans for future YinzBurgh locations. We're really excited about the prospect of a Carson St locale....think of it, drunk BBQ =)  My boyfriend has been debating all week what he'll try next on the Menu. They will be at Bakery Square this weekend for the BBQ and Craft Beer Festival and we can't wait to try more of their food!",

You get rich flavors rather than an over -salted sameness that is so common. The black-eyed peas and collards are so tasty(and vegan even). They seem to be based in a rich broth flavoring. The variety of sauces for the meats are so complex and delicious. I am still using the sauce I have left to flavor my own cooking - soups and meats.",

My coworker tried a Brisket & Bean chili and said the meat was delicious & tender.

I tried the \"Hoppin John\" with Black-eyed peas, baby spinach & seasonings and it was to die for! I would HIGHLY recommend this place.

You'll start with a quick tasting of the sauces, along with an explanation of the differences - there are at least 6 tasty sauces to choose from and each one was better than the last.   They complement the meats perfectly and the result is a truly wonderful BBQ meal.  The restaurant is small and cozy and in good weather there are some seats outside.

Never really found an authentic BBQ in Pittsburgh and Yinzburgh certainly fits the bill. The owners were there in the daytime and are very friendly in describing their methodology. We ordered take-out since there wasn't much of a restaurant area. Overall the food was quite good. I had the pulled pork and brisket. My fiance had the half-slab of ribs. Prices were a little steeper than I expected. We paid almost $40 for lunch for 2. The meats were delicious and required no sauce at all. The sides of coleslaw and black-eyed peas weren't my favorite. If I go back I think I'll be ordering a little differently and getting just the meats. I have a feeling this place will have a hard time staying open. Parking is difficult and there's a KFC right next door. I hope I'm wrong!",

Never again will I miss BBQ in this town! Yinzburgh just does it right by the meat - this is meat that tastes like meat and not like sauce. You can tell they are cooking with love because the favors are all there and the staff is clearly proud of their product. I'm solidly hooked on the honey mustard sauce, but all three are downright tasty. Do yourself a favor and at least give them a try - you won't regret it and I can bet you'll be as hooked as I am!!",

    "text": "Last year, we bought a home and started to grill and smoke our own meats. And after reading Daniel Vaughn's The Prophets of Smoked Meat, a road-trip through TX BBQ, we were eager to recreate our own sauce-laden travels in the Burgh. While we don't expect premier BBQ in Pittsburgh, we had hoped to find something better than mediocre.  It seemed fortuitous, then, that a Groupon appeared for Yinzburg BBQ. Perhaps, our hopes were too high based on the Yelp reviews we read, but we were quite disappointed in Yinzburgh's offerings. The Groupon entitled us to two sandwiches and two sides, and we also ordered a 1/4 slab of BBQ ribs. As other reviewers have mentioned, we received the \"tour of sauces\"--but whereas some described this as a leisurely learning process at the hands of the owners--we experienced a rapid fire pour, eat, decide where the sauce's flavors mingled and melded until neither one of us was sure which sauce was which. While none of them really tasted very good, we gamely chose three to try with our meat--the sweet and smoky, the original, and the afterburner. As near as I could tell, the latter two were made with a pretty heavy hand on the bottle of Wishbone Italian dressing. The food arrived promptly and the server was very pleasant. We split the pulled pork sandwich, the brisket sandwich, mac and cheese, collard greens, and the aforementioned ribs. The pork sandwich was lackluster, to the say the least. It was decently moist, but lacked seasoning, smoke, or flavor. The brisket was marginally better--a tad more smoke and seasoning--but it was reminiscent of corned beef (which, given our visit's proximity to St. Patty's Day may have been thematic?). The brisket leaned toward the fatty side, with little in the way of char, crust, or burnt end mixed in. While Paul ate his meat sans sauce, K, bravely (stupidly?), went back for more. The sauce did little to improve the meat. The sides were surprisingly pleasant. Although the mac and cheese wasn't particularly ooey-gooey or cheesy, it was nicely flecked with coarse black pepper giving it some oomph. The collard greens were the best part of the meal--briny, garlicky, and with some texture left to them. Mixing the greens with the mac and cheese helped offset any dryness in the pasta. We decided to save the review of the ribs for last, as they were the most disconcerting part of the meal. In Vaughn's book he often chides joints for gummy ribs and these were a prime example of what he's talking about. The rub was thickly and poorly applied--creating grainy coating. The meat had poorly rendered fat and was bland with no smoke ring. The flavor and consistency of the meat makes us suspect that the meat is cooked in an oven, not on a smoker. And the ribs tasted strongly of liquid smoke, which has a distinctive, potent smell. Our hands reeked from the liquid smoke, and we as drove home to wash them we decided we would wash our hands, too, of any future visits to Yinzburgh BBQ.",

The black-eyed peas were my favorite side - so delicious and flavorful. The collared greens and mac'n'cheese were also phenomenal.

    "text": "I'm extremely enthusiastic about YinzBurgh BBQ's contribution to Pittsburgh's culinary scene--and not just because it's close to my apartment.  YinzBurgh has scoured the country for inspiration in assembling its offerings, which manage to be mostly traditional yet pleasantly eclectic at the same time.  Like any good barbecue place, they take their meat and their customers extremely seriously.  But more than that, YinzBurgh manages to go beyond importing styles and sauce types from various barbecue meccas--they take the first steps toward defining a unique identity that may someday be known nationwide as \"Pittsburgh barbecue.\"  It was exciting to sample their offerings, and I'm excited to see what they do next.  I'll get to some of the meats in detail, but let me say that the side dishes are where YinzBurgh BBQ begins to define Pittsburgh BBQ.  The collard greens are simple and elegant.  The black-eyed peas are one of the most flavorful vegan-friendly options I've ever had at this kind of restaurant.  But what really sets the menu apart is the \"Chili-Q\"--a proprietary combination of chili and baked beans created by the owner himself.  It's truly a wonderful blend of traditional experiences, fused harmoniously into something utterly new yet comfortingly familiar.  In lieu of a detailed description, I'll give it my full-throated endorsement and urge you to try it.  And now, the moment you carnivores have all been waiting for, the meats (and sauces):  -The chicken is flavorful, roasted on the bone (and practically falling off of it).  -The ribs have excellent flavors, a bit like you'd find in Memphis.  They're hands down among the best I've had in this half of the state.  This meat also tends to fall off the bone.  -The brisket is a little reminiscent of what you'd find in Hill Country in Texas, though a touch drier and noticeably smokier with a surprising amount of flavor.  The brisket would pair well with literally anything else on the menu.  It's great by itself on a fork, in any of the sauces, on a sandwich, or mixed with other meats.  -The pulled pork is a bit harder for me to come up with a succinct and accurate description for, but let's just say if your companion offers you a \"bite or two\" (as mine did), you can expect to take a polite normal-sized first bite and an enormous bordering-on-rude second bite based on your initial experience.  -They have barbecue sauces, spicy and mild, from all the major traditions.  Tomato, mustard, and vinegar bases ensure there's something for everyone.  I highly recommend the spicy tomato-based on sauce; it goes well with pretty much everything (it's perfect for dipping).  [The primary downsides revolve around access.  It's a small place without much seating, so it's not great for big groups.  There's limited parking if you're driving, and the delivery is done through a third party, making it pretty expensive.  Having said all that, YinzBurgh is relatively new.  I see plenty of room for growth, expansion and improvement on all these points if enough Pittsburghers taste the food and then keep coming back--as I certainly will.]",

But they offer other options including two variations of spicy BBQ sauce and a honey mustard flavor which also tasted good.

    "text": "Mediocre takeout barbecue at full-service prices.    I don't know why I keep trying to eat yankee barbecue, because I have yet to find any that's very good.  YinzBurgh's is okay - tastes like it was done in an oven and finished with smoke, definitely not like authentic 'cue cooked at least ten hours over low hardwood heat.  I'd have given 3 stars, but not at these prices.  Really world-class places like Arthur Bryant's, Sweatman's, and Lexington charge significantly less, and they have actual seating.  (Yes I know YinzBurgh has some seats, but not enough.  If anyone else is there, you'll probably be s.o.l. on finding a place to sit down.)  BTW, I'm judging based on their pulled pork.  I'm from the Carolinas, so that's what I go to for in 'cue - can't comment on their brisket (Texas) or ribs (Memphis).  The sauces are okay.  The variety's nice, but none of the ones I tried were great.  The sides are average, too, but the lack of pork in the collards is pretty noticeable.    For a pork fix, YinzBurgh will suffice, but anyone who knows good barbecue is going to be left wanting.  Your best bet in the 'burgh is still to learn how to do a passable pork shoulder at home (and bring back sauce from your next trip to the South).",

Well, I love BBQ sauce and all the sides that go with it, so I really appreciate this place.   They have a smoked block of tofu, a tofu wrap, and tofu salad, plus veggie sides like collard greens and Mac and cheese. The tofu is amazing. It is dry-rubbed, like all their meats, and it's delicious. You get your choice of sauces with your meal-their signature red sauce is the best.  I think the Mac and cheese is also amazing-I watched them make it the last time I was there and it's all from scratch.    The place is really geared toward take-out; there are a few tables and chairs and a tv. Parking is available across the street at Einstein bagels.",

I'm normally a fan of delicious sauciness, but the dry rub and smoke is so good that you almost don't need the sauce... if the sauce wasn't so damn amazing. I'm a real fan of the Afterburner red sauce for brisket, and the Hot Honey for the pork ribs. My husband really likes their vinegar based sauce for pulled pork as well.  We recently tried their new menu items, their Chili-Q (side) and smoked Kolbassi. Both weere amazing. The Chili-Q is the love child of baked beans and chili and my god is it ever delicious (and I don't even like beans all that much). The smoked Kolbassi is basically smoked sausage (so good). The \"sandwich\" alone is not a lot of food, so make sure to order extra sides!",

    "text": "Doug and I eat alot of barbecue south of the Mason Dixon line, so it's not our first choice when we're home. And let's face it...most Yankees know next to nothing about real barbecue. Some folks may be offended by that last comment, but my opinion is based on suffering through many bad meals at barbecue wanna-be restaurants, both locally and in other Northern states. The people who run this restaurant are bona fide Southerners, however, and the reviews had me feeling optimistic, so we decided to give them a visit for lunch today.   This is counter service, with a couple of bar height tables for standing at and some benches for waiting. The woman behind the counter could not have been any nicer, and offered samples of their various barbecue sauces, explaining that they use a dry rub on their meats and serve the sauce on the side. So far, so good. I deeply appreciate a place that doesn't smother their meat in sauce. The red tomato based sauce was a little too herby for my taste, with noticeable amounts of cumin and chili powder. I didn't love it. The North Carolina vinegar sauce was spot on...simple and, well, vinegary, with lots of black pepper and a hint of sweetness. Their South Carolina style mustard sauce has honey in it, and was a little too sweet for my taste. I'm not put off when I don't like the sauces that an establishment offers, however, as I can go without if the pork is perfect. The only other thing I'll say about the sauces is that I wish they kept them at the table in squirt bottles. The little plastic to go ramekins are a waste if you're dining in.   I got the combo with chicken and pulled pork, and Doug got a full rack of ribs so we could share. We both got sides of collard greens and black eyed peas. I noticed right away that the pulled pork was dry. It had no discernable fat in it, and was pulled into very small shreds, which only further caused it to dry out. I doused it with the NC vinegar sauce, and, while the flavor was good, the dryness was disappointing. We talked to the pit master and he went back to check on the shoulder, and came back saying that it did indeed have very little fatback on it, so it seems the pulled pork was dryer today than it usually is. I would give it another try, as it was tasty otherwise. The chicken was very moist and delicious, with a nice smoky flavor. The ribs come with a very assertive rub that didn't fully dissolve into the meat...maybe this is where a little sugar in the rub would have helped caramelize things...so you got mouthfuls of dry rub in every bite. It eventually overwhelmed the flavor of the meat and became tiring to the palate. While the ribs themselves were not dry, they were chewy and lacked that succulent fall-off-the-bone quality that I look for. I've had ribs like this in the South, so they're most definitely a certain style, and were not bad for what they are. Just not my fave. The knock outs today were the sides. The collard greens were simple and tasty, and the black eyed peas were wonderful. I could make a meal of these two things alone any day of the week.   We drank water with our meal as they only had bottled Nestea, which I detest, and I don't drink soda, although the local offerings in that category are a nice touch. I like fresh brewed tea with my barbecue, and was assured that this will be coming in the future.",

Excellent pulled pork, macaroni and cheese, beans, coleslaw, and hot sauces. I definitely look forward to occasions when I get a chance to eat this, and one of these days will actually check out the restaurant itself.  On the other hand, avoid the salads. They're pretty sad and seem like they were just poured out of a pre-mixed salad bag. The meat on top is still good, but doesn't make up for what's underneath.",

    "text": "A copy of the review from my blog:  Last night before the band played a show in Bloomfield, my wife & I stopped with some friends at Yinzburg BBQ on Baum Blvd. in Bloomfield.  Last time I was in that building it was a Roly Poly, and it's certainly a different place now.  I'm a huge fan of BBQ and I have been reading great reviews about the place online, so I was very anxious to check it out.  (Also, I've been in a BBQ mood lately.)  Of course with the whole shellfish allergy thing, I took a look at the menu online before we went down.  My mouth was watering at all of the delicious prospects.  Thankfully, there is no deathfish present on the menu.  I've sadly gone to places before that have had daily specials or menu revamps that aren't online... so I decided to send them an email.  I was met with a quick, friendly & inviting reply from owner & chef Richard.  His philosophy seems to be summed up in his email signature:      1. Barbecue is a cuisine; Barbecue sauce is a condiment!     2. The sauce is served on the side.     3. The love is in the rub!  When we walked in we were greeted by a woman with a sweet southern accent who asked us if we had ever been there before.  We indicated that we hadn't & got a lesson in the 4 main & 2 hot barbecue sauces.  I liked the vinegar one & the signature red...  And, I liked that you could get 2 different ones with your meal.  Next time I might get the mustard sauce.  I had the brisket & pulled pork combo with the signature red & vinegar sauces (served on the side, so you can apply or dip however you like), the coleslaw, and a root beer from Natrona.  I tried both meats sans sauce, and they were incredible.  I found myself having a hard time deciding which sauce I liked better with which meat.  The coleslaw was creamy and flavorful.  I also had a sample of my wife's mac n' cheese (she got a delicious looking half chicken), and our friends' collard greens.  The mac n' cheese was nice & creamy and the collard greens were delicious.  I've sadly never had any until now.  We even had a very satisfied vegetarian in our midst who seemed to really like the smoked tofu wrap.  It's not every day you find a BBQ place that serves vegan and vegetarian items.  There were two 2-seater tables outside, and 2 tables with standing room only inside.  We stood as we dined,negotiating around the mountain of food in front of us.  Halfway through the meal, I was already planning what to order for my next visit.  Next time it's chicken & ribs... maybe the black eyed peas on the side.  Next time will also be soon!  They asked us to tell our friends... and if you're reading this... you're my friend, and you need to go check this place out!  I was so enamored with the food... I forgot to take a photo to upload... oh well, maybe next time!",

The brisket had good flavor but was way overcooked, and fell apart before I could pick it up.  The pulled pork was good but lacked any good bark chunks.  We liked the smoked chicken.  The sauces were all good but nothing knocked my socks off.  Overall this is a 2-3* in the South, but Pittsburgh is lacking in this market so it gets points there.

    "text": "I have to preface this review by letting you know that I write a BBQ blog and that I have eaten more than my share of BBQ around the country.  I have a lot of small and not so small things that I didn't love about their food.  Some are personal preferences.  First, I have to commend the owners for their hospitality and menu.  They're eager to educate people about real BBQ and are very interested in what you think about their product.    We ordered chicken, pulled pork and ribs.  I thought the smoke level was really quite good.  The pulled pork was very dry.  I liked it with the vinegar sauce.  Which, by the way, was the best of the sauces they had to offer.  I also tried it with the mustard, which I liked in moderation but thought it was too sweet and too spicy.  Everything was too spicy.  BBQ isn't spicy.  We got the 1/4 dark chicken and it was moist and delicious.  I think the rub is ok.  The ribs were a little dry.  They might consider a fattier St Louis style rib.  I definitely think ribs should be moist and succulent.  Fat is flavor.  The rub is grainy and adds a mealy grainy mouth feel if you don't finish it on a grill or use enough sugar to turn it into a caramelized coating.   The red sauce hasn't cooked it's spices in so it's really grainy and again too spicy.  I didn't like the chili powder overtones either.    The stars were the sides we ordered.  The black eyed peas were really good, again didn't need to be spicy but nonetheless delicious.  The greens were very nice and tasted of their vinegar sauce.  I thought they could have been cooked a little longer but I really did like them a lot.    They need to allow you squeeze bottles of their sauce if you are dining in.  There's no sense in wasting the little plastic to-go cups or not allowing you to try multiple sauces at will.  We didn't finish what they gave us so they were also wasting sauce.  Everything is served in plastic and I really don't like the waste.  We took some of it with us to recycle at home.  A squeeze bottle will cost them a buck.    I liked the people quite a bit and hope that they find an audience here to support them.  I am on the fence with the rating, it's 2.5 stars for me.",

With a name like YinzBurgh though, I should have expected it to be what it is - a home townie kind of place with great hospitality. And pretty great food too.   If you haven't been there yet, they will take you on a tour across the south with their six or so different sauces: a couple tomato based, a couple mustard, a vinegar, and of course a sweeter bbq style.   On my pulled pork sandwich (weakness) I chose the bbq flavor AND the spicy mustard based one, which come on the side to be put on later. I was torn. I could not choose just one. They both delivered.   For the side I also had the same problem. Cole slaw, or mac n cheese? Clearly I need both. I was hyped up by the guy behind the counter about their mac n cheese, so my standards were set high. Maybe this is why I was unfortunately a bit disappointed by it. It's not toooo cheesy, there's cheese in it, just not gooey or stringy or soupy or anything like that. Just a coating. The cole slaw was also a bit bland and lacking in my opinion, BUT, I did come just before closing so there's a chance I got the bottom of the barrel and it was just plain worn out by then. We're gonna go with that, and I'll stop by again during the day and give those things another shot.   All in all, not bad. I will go again especially since it's the closest bbq place to my house. Oh, and pro tip; I suggest parking in the KFC parking lot right next to it, you can do that.",

    "text": "You'll find some serious southern hospitality here!  As soon as we walked in what I suppose was one of the owners greeted us with a sweet southern accent.  She asked if we had been there before, and when we replied no, she immediately started to describe what they were all about.  How nice I thought!  She also had us sample each BBQ sauce to pick up which one we liked best.  I thought I'd be all about the vinegar based one, but man that was potent!  I liked the original BBQ but I opted for a kicky mustard BBQ.  So with southern style BBQ the owner explained that you put the sauce on last.  I never realized that, so it was interesting to know.    So I dumped a healthy helping of mustard sauce on top of my pulled pork sandwich.  The pulled pork was awesome, very tender and not a dry piece in the mix.  I knew as soon as I saw the side options I wanted to try the coleslaw.  Now, you never know whether a slaw is going to be good or not.  The wrong amount of seasoning, or not enough, can leave it boring or just plain gross.  This was delicious, a True slaw winner in my book!    Just a note, there's not much of a \"restaurant.\"  There's only two benches and two high top tables with no chairs.  I suppose it's just mostly a take out spot.  They also serve delicious (and local!) Red Ribbon soda!  At $18 for two dinners with sides and drinks I would say it's a cheap/fast dinner option on the go!  Can't wait to try some other BBQ selections!!",

The sauce was VERY underwhelming and almost no kick at all for something called \"Afterburner\" and described as spicy. Cole slaw was really sweet, which made it weird.   Ho-hum BBQ joint. Nothing stood out, but for the price it was decent.",

    "text": "After a disappointing previous experience with BBQ in the city, I was hoping that Yinzburgh could redeem the city's BBQ scene. Upon finding out the owners were from Georgia, I thought to myself, \"these guys gotta know what reall BBQ is\". Turns out, they do!  My first time at YB, I tried the pulled pork with a side of cole slaw and macaroni and cheese. I'm picky about all three of those things, so it was a leap of faith to get them all and have high expectations. I was very happy with everything I ordered. The pork was tender and full of flavor, even without the BBQ sauce. The cole slaw was creamy and had the right amount of tanginess. The mac'n cheese actually tastes homemade and is creamy with a lot of cheddar cheese. Score!  My second trip to YB, I tried the brisket. Oh. Em. Gee! This brisket is perfect! Fork tender with a perfectly charred outer crust and tell-tale smoke ring. Take that, hipster BBQ joint on N. Highland! Maybe you can learn something from these guys!  YB has 3 homemade sauces to cover the BBQ geography of your St. Louis style red BBQ sauce, Carolina Style vinegar sauce and a mustard based sauce. It's hard to chose a favorite because they are all good on any of the meats.   The smoked wings are a must-try as well.",

    "text": "Excellent barbeque, traditional and creative sides; owner prepares with love and skill. Accommodating of food aversions and allergies; many vegan and vegetarian offerings (not just the sides).  Gluten free offerings.  Great ribs, pulled pork, smoked chicken.  Salads are huge, with generous serving of the meat ordered (or barbeque tofu).  My husband is a very picky barbeque fiend and he loved it.  In fact, it was the first taste of real food he had after leaving the hospital and it reminded him he still loved food (just not hospital food).    Orders prepared swiftly, so be ready to head over quick if you phone your order in. We got medium portions of several meats, three side dishes, some cornbread for three people and still had leftovers we ate for two days after.  Got all three sauces, liking the Carolina Vinegar on the pulled pork (which didn't need any, but it was a nice extra kick of flavor), their Signature sauce was not overly spicy, but quite tasty with the chicken or brisket.  The ribs needed nothing added -- fall off the bone tasty.  A pulled chicken salad on another day was just huge and so satisfying.  I loved the Honey Gold mustard sauce with that one.  Their coleslaw is possibly the best I've had anywhere, ever.  A friend had their smoked tofu and loved it; she never thought she'd be craving anything at a barbeque joint!    It's one of my short list of go-to places when in Pittsburgh/Shadyside area.",

Now I'm not talking delicious-super-fancy-hoity-toity delicious, I'm talking about authentic, good, solid, food. I would have gone with 4 stars except the service is amazing. The owner -- he's friendlier and better with names than I am -- talked with us in detail about which sauce we should choose, and let us sample his sides before choosing one. I don't normally go to too many restaurants more than once or twice, because my budget doesn't allow me to eat out much and I like to try new things. But the owner's friendliness has put this on my go-to list. I had pork sans sandwich with the Georgia-style honey-mustard-based sauce. Mmmmmm. So good. So filling. The coleslaw is purple :)",

    "text": "When it comes to BBQ I think Pittsburgh is really lacking. I'm from the south so I know my BBQ and that makes me a tough customer in this department.   I went to Yinzburgh BBQ and had a pulled pork sandwich and a side of mac and cheese and everything was good.   So why just the 3 stars? Well I just wasn't impressed. It was good but the place is a shoe box with very little seating and you will eat your food with a plastic fork out of aluminum foil or styrofoam while sitting in their lifeless dining area.   I felt like the proportions you got for the price was a little expensive for a place with no atmosphere. You might as well take your food with you and eat in a more comfortable environment.   I would rather buy BBQ from those guys that pull their trailer smokers into the gas station parking lots where $10 buys you enough BBQ to two people and it's beyond delicious. Too bad Pittsburgh doesn't offer stuff like that, not like in the south.",

We walked in, and were instantly greeted by the owner and what I'm assuming was his wife(?). Both were incredibly welcoming. Upon hearing that it was our first visit, he walked us through a sampling of all of their homemade sauces and explained each. Perhaps we were there at a slower time, but it was great to have a nice conversation with the owner. He discussed his cooking methods and preferences for BBQ. He even let us try the black-eyed peas and collard greens - both were good...and both were vegan, which was a nice surprise for anyone perhaps looking for vegan options (they also have BBQ tofu options).  My wife and I walked out of YinzBurgh with chicken, ribs, brisket, pulled pork, collard greens, mac & cheese, and cole slaw; a decent sampling, to say the least.  Overall, I really can't complain about anything. The pulled pork was excellent, the brisket was good (though maybe slightly dry), and the ribs were good. Note, that this isn't the type of BBQ that comes smothered in sauce, and honestly, you don't need much sauce - if any - to enjoy.  Add in the fact that all of the sides were good, and it's hard to provide any reasons not to go back next time we're in a BBQ mood!",

First off, when asked if we had ever been there before, the nice gentleman working went through all of their different flavors of sauces and had us sample them.  He also asked if we had ever had black eyed peas or collard greens.  Both answers were no... But after today, we can say yes.  I was so pleasantly surprised, that I bought the collard greens too.

    "text": "OK first off this is a BBQ place that has not only Vegetarian options but also Vegan ones, that to me is amazing!  After reading so many yelp reviews I decided to swing by one day with DH.  He ordered the pulled pork (no sandwich) and I got the quarter chicken.  We had to have a few sides of course, so we ordered the black eyed peas, collard greens, and macaroni & cheese.  First off the Yinzburg Afterburner sauce is to die for, its sweet, hot, and tangy all at the same time, and is a perfect complement to the lovely smoked meats.  The star of the show was the black eyed peas.  It reminded me of a special north Indian dish I frequently cooked called Lobia, except without the kicked up spice.  It totally hit the spot.    The owner of this fine establishment was friendly, and willing to explain the process he uses to smoke the meats, and the tofu.  The only thing I was disappointed to hear was that they use to offer smoked paneer (Indian cheese), but no longer do.  They were not getting enough orders, so they ended up throwing it away every night.  How about we all start a revolution to get it reinstated, what do you say :)?",

I think their best ones are probably the ribs and the beef brisket; the ribs were especially tender and flavorful, with the meat falling right off the bone. The brisket went well with any of the sauces, which by the way were pretty awesome considering that they were extremely friendly in introducing and allowing us to sample the sauces before ordering. Nice deal in that we could pick a different sauce for each item in the combo.   The pulled pork and chicken were pretty solid as well. For the sides we had the greens and the chili, both of which complemented the meal. I would like to try the tofu sometime, although we were told we couldn't put it in the combo. :(  This is a very nice place overall, especially since Pittsburgh doesn't really have much southern BBQ to begin with. The accommodations could be bigger (only a couple tables and no restroom), and the prices are on the expensive side, but coming here once in a while can't hurt.",

The mac and cheese was okay though you could tell it was pre-packaged. When I took it out of the container, the mac and cheese was a little cold and held its shape from the container. The sauce definitely made this meal good but if I can enjoy my BBQ without any sauce it is my preferred way (and add sauce to supplement the flavor).

I also prefer a hard roll to a soft roll (I hope this isn't sacrelige in the BBQ world?) but it was definitely satisfying.

He also gave me samples of their okra and both types of beans so I could make an educated decision on what to get in my q-rito.  He was just super sweet and engaging all around.  I ended up ordering the quarter chicken, a smoked tofu q-rito, the mac 'n' cheese, and the stewed okra.  When I told him it was alllllll for just me he high-fived me for having such an awesome appetite.  Even after I had placed my order and paid, he gave me yet another sample of the mac 'n' cheese mixed with the stewed okra, so I would know how amazing it is to mix them together!  And it was.  The chicken was 'fall off the bone', the smoked tofu q-rito was great, mac 'n' cheese obviously can't go wrong there, but the okra was my fave.  Go there!!  DO IT NOW.",

The meat just falls off the bone and the sauces really compliment the dry rub.  I tried the extra spicy and the honey mustard -- both are great.  All in all, this place is a great spot.

The food was really good but in my opinion a little pricey.  The owner was really nice and you could tell he really cared about the product.  I would recommend the ribs they were really good  As far as the cons go.  I would prefer the owner not bother us so much.  He came out a little more often than I would have preferred.  My biggest complaint I had is he kinda made me feel rushed to order.  Also he asked me if I want a quarter or half rack of ribs.  The half was not nearly enough so I got another quarter.  After that he told me most people just get the whole rack because it's the best deal.  Well why wasn't that an option at the beginning?   That was honestly really frustrating and the main reason for the 3 stars.  Don't get any ribs except the whole rack",

    "text": "I've been to Yinzburgh BBQ twice and just from those two visits, I have already experienced better customer service than 99% of the restaurants in my life. For example, as other reviewers have posted below; if you are a first time visitor, they will give you a sample of each of their sauces and a explanation of their origins. Then when you are done ordering, either to-go or sit-in, they personally come out from behind the counter and deliver the food to you. For each person, they also provide a small moist hand wipe which is just a nice touch. Once you get your food, prepare to taste the deliciously smoked but all so tender meat with a side of their flavorful sauce of your choosing. The customer service does not just stop when you receive your food like fast food joints; they make sure that you are fully satisfied until you depart their wonderful southern hospitality. E.g. when one person in my party required more water, they didn't just offer to refill his cup, they brought out a pitcher of water just for our table just in case any one of us was also still thirsty. I highly recommend everyone to try this place out, you won't regret it!",

For the most part, the meats ( pulled pork, brisket and ribs) were good but brisket was too dry. Sauced are good also. Pass on the sides- cole slaw and greens were tasteless and they ran out of corn bread ( said didn't have time to make more).

The inside of the place isn't much to look at with a table for 4, a high top table for 6 and then two park like benches to wait for to go orders.  The walls were also painted red to orange to yellow which helped to evoke the thought of fire. The cashier (owner?) here greeted us right away and asked if we had ever been there before which we had not.  Upon hearing that he proceeded to tell us about the type of BBQ they did and helped us to taste all 6 of their sauces.  I ended up going with the beef brisket sandwich with the Carolina vinegar BBQ while my wife went with a pulled pork wrap with hot Carolina mustard BBQ sauce.  We then split sides of Mac and cheese and collard greens.  The sandwich was pretty awesome as the brisket was both tender and had a great smokey flavor.  My only complaints with it being that the bun didn't seem to be toasted and it was tough to get the vinegar based sauce on the meat.  My wife really enjoyed her pulled pork wrap and had no complaints about it.  The sides ended up being really good too with the Mac and cheese having visible pepper in it and the collard greens having huge cloves of soft  garlic in it.  While not something I had seen before, it helped enhance the flavor and my wife and I quickly finished them.  The bottom line for me is that I will head back here again in the future.  The guy at the cash register was super nice and I really loved all of the food that I tasted.",

The brisket just melted in my mouth with each bite. For sides, had the chili and black-eyed peas. The chili was a bit too sweet for my taste. The black-eyed pea was more like a bean stew, which wasn't what I was expecting. Overall, I had a great dinning experience here and definitely recommend this place for those craving grilled food. Prices are reasonable and you get a good portion. Thanks for taking good care of us Yinzburgh!",

First the positives: the sauces are pretty good, especially the mustard based sauce; also, the staff is friendly like others have pointed out; coleslaw was decent.  We got the sampler, which included pulled pork, beef brisket, quarter chicken (ie, read leg), and a few ribs. The ribs and chicken were probably our favorites; however I didn't think they were great. They both had some good flavor, but were a little lacking. The pulled pork was very bland and the fattiest pulled pork I've ever had; however, it was really moist. The beef brisket was very bland as well. I was expecting it to have a crust of seasoning.  My final complaint is that the portions are a bit small for the price. I would try this place again, but I know there is better BBQ around.",

The owner was really accommodating and gave us a run down as to how ordering worked in the joint. He also gave us the opportunity to try some of the sauces for the meat that are all made in house. My favorite sauce was probably the signature red ... wasn't too tarty, but it was also flavorful enough to be considered an excellent addition to whatever meat is ordered. I ended up ordering the #8 combo, which essentially contained the pork ribs, pulled pork, and pork brisket. Personally, I found the pork ribs to be delicious ... glad it wasn't dry since that's probably the easiest way to mess ribs up by overcooking them. The pork brisket was also satisfactory, but it's hard to not crave Texas BBQ especially when I've had it recently. I found the pulled pork to be a bit on the dry side ... probably ended up being overcooked, although having three different kinds of sauce (comes with combo) does help alleviate that small issue. Overall, I was pretty satisfied. This is a good place for BBQ if anyone is craving it in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "2.5 stars rounding up  One of the few True BBQ places in Pittsburgh that has definitely has some positives but also has plenty of room for improvement.   I came here with my girlfriend on a Saturday afternoon .  She had never really had BBQ and I had recently returned from a trip to Austin having quite possibly the best BBQ ever at Franklin's (see other review) and was really craving some brisket,   We went in and it was just us and the owner who was working in the kitchen.  I looked at the menu and noticed it was in arbitrary sizes (S,M,L,XL) and not in concrete weight so i asked how much weight this was and got a round about answer which he used various degrees of hunger to describe the portions.  So i asked my very indecisive girlfriend what she wanted and she was like a beer in headlights  because she had \"real BBQ\" so i asked for a small sample or the brisket so she could try it... The owner looked puzzled like this question had never been asked before. After about a minute he emerged with a small piece of brisket she tried it and said she liked it.  He began explaining about BBQ and how he used a dry rub rather than a sauce when cooking it, and then segued into a 10 min monologue that went over BBQ, his life, business etc. We patiently waited for him to finish and then ordered. He kept giving suggestions and kept trying to up sell us saying that it would not be enough, like he was calling me out.    So we got brisket, beans, mac and cheese, cornbread and pulled pork  and cole slaw. Ended up being like $45 with drinks. Within a few minutes the food came out and i was actually surprised that it wasn't that much food.  The Food was a bit underwhelming (perhaps because i had just returned from the benchmark of BBQ in Austin) the brisket was dry, and needed the sauces to be eaten. Pulled pork was probably the highlight.  Beans were good, coleslaw mac and cheese were avg, Corn bread was soooooo dry.  Owner came out several times and continued the monologue from before and we patiently listened    We ended up finishing everything minus one of the cornbreads.  The 40 or so minutes we were there no one else came in.  Now i know its not Texas, but at Franklins in Austin we got about $160-$180 of food for ten people and we had leftovers for days... literally.  So the bang for the buck just wasn't there in comparison.  If you have never had real BBQ i would definitely recommend this place because it has a nice selection.  But if you know BBQ then this does not stand out.",

You can tell the staff is passionate about BBQ in their willingness to explain the menu and patience in allowing customers to try all of their housemade sauces.  The sauces are more spiced than sauces typically found in Pittsburgh which tend to be creamy or ketchup. They also have spicy (hot) versions of a couple of the sauces for those who like an extra kick.  As for food, I ended up trying the pulled pork, the beef brisket, the baby back ribs, and the mac'n'cheese. All of the meats were juicy and the ribs fell off the bone.

Parking is available across the street at Einstein Bros. after 2:30 PM otherwise there is street parking. They accept cash and cards for payment.   If you are new, let them know and they will get you oriented and introduced to their food and sauces available. They will walk you through the flavor and origins of the sauces, which I found quite interesting.   I had the pulled pork sandwich and a side of macaroni and cheese. I was between that and the brisket sandwich but being my first time to this place, I had to try the pulled pork. The pulled pork was not dry at all and was wonderful when paired with their \"afterburner\" sauce. Their meats are cooked with dry rubs and not sauces. All of this was pulled together with an IBC root beer. Ill be sure to try their brisket the next time I go     Make sure to take the time to chat with the owner and staff. They are extremely friendly and will give you good advice about what to get.   I definitely plan on going again. Five stars for sure.",

The selection of mains come in all different sizes, and with a bunch of sides to choose from you can have quite the smorgasbord.   The pork was fantastic paired with the vinegar based Carolina sauce (I believe it was Carolina), and the ribs were great with the mustard based sauces. The whole meal was enjoyable.  Will visit again, for sure!!",

    "text": "I've gotten takeout from here twice, and will continue to go back if only for the Afterburner sauce and that amazing mac & cheese. The owner kindly takes you through a sauce tasting on your first visit so that you can figure out what style BBQ fits your palate (we liked the majority of them). He also let us try several of the sides, which are all vegetarian, but personally, I can't handle greens without pork.   The short ribs were delicious and tender, and the brisket and chicken were similarly fall-apart but I'm just not into the \"sauce on the side\" deal--I like my flavors mixed through. On that note, take some Afterburner and stir it through that mac...epicly good. Their mac is a stovetop mac and is like a black peppered, grownup Kraft made with real things (which is a huge compliment from me as I love the blue box).  I'll still give the pulled chicken a shot because I think that might be easier to mix sauce through, but for me, the meats NEED the (delicious) sauce--there's not quite enough flavor rendered from the rub & smoke to eat standalone. There's not a ton of seating, so I would recommend carry-out for a crowd...they are well-versed in logical packaging for your eating ease.",

    "text": "The owners (and as a matter of fact all the staff my wife and I met) are super friendly, and so passionate about their craft that they'll be ladling out samples of their sauces before you've even had a chance to absorb what's going on.  The meats are all very good, although the pulled pork can be on the slightly dry side from time to time.  Portions are of average size (an anomaly in a city where sandwiches are routinely as big as your head and are stuffed with french fries), and they have some interesting local soft drinks.  It's on the pricy side for what it is, and some of the sides (e.g. the mac n' cheese and the cole slaw) are merely average in taste and execution.  That being said, there's something to be said about super-friendly dudes (and dudettes) who are so passionate about BBQ that they felt like they had a moral obligation to open up a restaurant.  For crying out loud, one of the times we went in the guy decided he was going to give us a (truly entertaining and engrossing, by the way) lecture on the origins, makeup, and philosophy of use for the individual sauces he'd created.  It was amazing, terrifying, amazingly terrifying, and terrifyingly amazing all at once.  Last note.  We went there when they first opened up shop, way back in the fall of 2012.  Things may have changed since we last went there (although from the looks of the more recent reviews, it doesn't look that way).",

    "text": "Wow - this place blew me away!   Like everyone has said previously the owners are REALLY friendly.  They provided a sampling of all their sauces so we could make an informed decision as to which sauce to put on our food.  Now Vegans, listen up!  The owner is very vegan knowledgeable.  Not only did he tell us which sauces were vegan he also has a separate smoker for the tofu.  No worries about meat cross contamination.  My girlfriend let out a deep sign of relief without having to worry about how vegan conscientious the place was.    My gf had the vegan tofu wrap and with the first bite she was in shock over how good it was.  If you're a vegan and miss the smokey flavor then you really need to try the tofu here.  The texture is really good and the smokiness is in every single bite.  We also shared the black eyed peas.  Neither one of us had experienced black eyed peas before but we both couldn't stop raving about how flavorful they were.  Definitely the way to go with your side!  I had the 1/4 slab ribs.  My only regret was not ordering the 1/2 slab.  So good!  Meat fell right off the bone and went great with the afterburner sauce.    Before we left we told the owner we would probably be back with a few days.  Thank goodness I finally found a BBQ place I love in Pittsburgh.",

I did have YinzBurgh about a year or so prior to this review and it was OK, not the best, but far from terrible at that time. However maybe the word spreading and more customers have forced some oversight at the cooking stage. I am fairly picky about BBQ from growing up in TX and eating at many nationally rated BBQ joints. From the meal I had recently, YinzBurgh is far from getting credit on any real ranking list.   Both items (Brisket and Beef Ribs) were definitely cooked way too fast (hot) which is a common mistake when BBQ restaurants see an increase in customers and try to keep up with demand. All the connective tissue had not rendered, so it was tough, lacking flavor and very stringy. The ribs were highly over salted and also were very fatty from expedited cooking. Definitely not going back.",

It was an awesome experience.   Right when we walked in the door we were greeted by one of the owners. He asked us if we had ever been there before (which we have not) and then proceeded to explain their southern style BBQ and let us taste test all of the home made BBQ sauces. My boyfriend and I loved the hot mustard and spicy tomato based BBQ sauces. I also really enjoyed the tang at the end of the Carolina vinegar based sauce.   I ordered a pulled chicken sandwich, coleslaw, Mac and cheese and the hoppin' john (rice, beans and collard greens mixed). My boyfriend ordered coleslaw and the beef brisket sandwich. Both of our sandwiches were tender and delicious. We both added the coleslaw on top of our sandwiches, which gave them a nice twist. The Mac and cheese was delicious- not too creamy but with a lot of flavor. I loved the coleslaw- it was processed very thin and was packed with flavor. The hoppin' John was delicious as well- I probably wouldn't have ordered it if I didn't have a card for a free one though-I'm not a huge bean fan. The collard greens gave it a nice southern twist.   The customer service was great, the food was awesome and I LOVED that they serve vegan and vegetarian options- what other BBQ joint in the burgh offers smoked tofu? My only issue was the bun- it fell apart pretty easy making the sandwich a little difficult to eat. Other than that, it was an awesome experience and I would definitely go back!",

We ordered the brisket, ribs and pulled pork combo and honestly the ribs were the only item worth eating.  The brisket and pulled pork were so dry there was no chance to eat it without sauce, as we were told Southern BBQ should be.  The food was served barely warm as well and this was at 6:30 in the evening, high time for dinner.  The slaw and cornbread were nothing to write home about.  The cornbread was served in plastic wrap, is this the correct way?  Friendly service though but never going back.",

The mac and cheese was flavorful, although the sauce had congealed somewhat by the time I got to it. The real showstopper was the smoked tofu. I know, I know, it sounds like a crazy thing to eat, even if you like tofu. But, it was really, really delicious. The smoke gave the tofu a nice skin, and it tasted woody.

    "text": "I had high hopes for this place based on reviews from my fellow Yelpers, but unfortunately I did not love my recent experience here.  I had been meaning to try this place for awhile and lo and behold, I came across a Groupon (hooray for Groupon!) So the hubby and I went this past weekend. The Groupon was good for two sandwiches/wraps and two sides.  The place itself is small -- it's almost like an indoor BBQ stand. It only has a few benches for waiting and maybe four small dine-in tables. We went during dinner time, and while it wasn't packed, there was a steady stream of customers.  Our ordering experience was not great. The Groupon was good for two sandwiches and sides, but when I went to order my sandwich (pulled chicken, white meat), I was told that they were only doing dark meat chicken for the Groupon. So, two things about this. First, to exclude white meat chicken sandwiches from the Groupon seems nonsensical...the pulled chicken sandwich is $4.75 ($1.00 more for white meat)...the cheapest sandwich on the menu. So why would they exclude this? It would make them the most money from the Groupon. But second, and most importantly -- nowhere on the Groupon did it say that this was an exclusion. In fact, if it did, I may not have bought the Groupon in the first place. So, needless to say, this was annoying to learn as I was ordering.  I wasn't in the mood for dark meat, so while I was debating what to do, the owner came over and agreed to give me a white meat sandwich if I would pay the $1.00 difference. I felt like I was being nickel-and-dimed, but whatever, it was a dollar. So I said fine. But then they couldn't figure out how to charge me just a dollar on the iPad that they use as a cash register. Meanwhile, a line of customers was building up behind us. I can tell the owner was frazzled, so it probably would've been easier just to let the dollar go, but she kept trying to find a way to charge me. I finally said I would just buy a couple of drinks and some cornbread and then add the extra dollar as a tip. Problem solved, but I wasn't exactly feeling the warm customer service fuzzies here.  Next was the sauce-tasting part, but after the whole white meat chicken debacle, there was a fairly long line behind us, so the cashier went through the sauces at rapid fire speed. I didn't really have enough time to think about which one I wanted and felt rushed, so I just went with the first one I tried (the smoky and sweet BBQ).  So customer service issues aside, how was the food? Well, I ended up getting the ill-fated white meat chicken sandwich, my hubby got the brisket sandwich, and then we got mac and cheese and coleslaw for sides, plus some cornbread. My sandwich was pretty dry (which is unsurprising, since I picked the driest meat on the planet). However, what I was disappointed with was the flavor. I first tried a bite without any sauce to taste just the meat, and there really wasn't much to it...maybe a very faint hint of smokiness, but other than that, it was really bland. Once I doused the sandwich in the BBQ sauce, the taste improved dramatically...the sauce had a great balance of sweet and smoky flavor with a hint of spice. That being said, it would've been nice if the meat had a little flavor of its own that the sauce complemented, instead of having the flavor of the whole sandwich be dependent on the sauce. The other off-putting part of the sandwich was that there were a lot of bones. I understand if one or two make their way in there, but I was chomping down on a small bone like every other bite or so. It was gross pulling those out of my mouth as I was eating.  The other thing that I found odd is that we dined in, but yet we were still given little plastic cups with our sauces in them. Why not have the sauces in squeeze bottles at the tables? I understand doing it for take out orders, but if you're eating in, it would be nice to be able to use as much or as little sauce as you want (or even use multiple sauces). Plus the little plastic cups just seemed wasteful.   On a positive note, my husband loved his brisket sandwich. He reported that it was well-cooked, melt-in-your-mouth tender, and deliciously smoky. He got the hot honey mustard sauce and thought that it struck a perfect sweet-spicy balance that nicely complemented the meat.    As for the sides, they were a mixed bag. The mac and cheese was okay, but nothing special. It was flavorful, but it was kinda oily instead of rich and creamy. We both enjoyed the coleslaw the most. It was tangy, well-seasoned, and had a perfect consistency -- creamy without being too thick. The biggest disappointment was the cornbread. Although it looked appetizing, it was really dry and completely devoid of flavor.  Overall, given the Groupon debacle and the inconsistent food quality, I'd have to say that I left feeling pretty meh about the experience overall. I'm not going to be rushing back here anytime soon.",

Was very pleased with the service.  The cost was very reasonable.  The meats are smoked and then you add the the sauce.  The brisket was most excellent.  It did not last long.  I probably should have ordered more.  The pulled pork was done to perfection.  The chicken was also a big hit.  The sauces were all quite tasty.  There is really something for everyone.    As for the sides, the black eyed peas were quite good.  The chili-Q was smash hit.  Everyone was raving about it.    Overall, an excellent job.  If you are in the mood for bbq, check out there place.  It is essentially a take out joint with a few tables for seating",

There was then a delay while the woman who took the order put their order together by herself. Can't this place hire some help for a Saturday night?   Finally it was time for her to take our order. Oh wait, the phone rang and she took their order! Really?!? We should have called them instead of waiting  patiently for our turn!   It gets better. After taking the phone order, she tells us that it will be 20 minutes before she can take our order because she needs to work on a catering order. No thanks, YInzburgh. We left.  Maybe someday we will return but we will call our order ahead!",

We have always enjoyed their food, especially the pulled pork with Smok'n Sweet sauce and sides (collard greens and Chili-Q), so we decided to have them cater our wedding. They gave great advice when helping us choose sides and quantities. They were so easy to work with. The price was also incredibly cheap, in terms of wedding planning. We got all this delicious food for our Pittsburgh-themed wedding at the fraction of a cost as a regular wedding catering company. We were also able to provide plenty of options for our vegetarian friends. Everyone loved it. At our wedding, I finally tried the chicken and mac and cheese, both of which were amazing.  I highly recommend YinzBurgh for both everyday meals and for catering.  Note - there isn't much seating inside, so it may be best to get food to go. You can also call ahead to order.",

None of the meat had any flavor, it was almost like they removed flavor from the meat, and then no flavor from the rub and no flavor from the smoke.  There was no bark on the meat, how is that possible from BBQ   Sure I could have put their sauce on the meat to get some flavor but that is not good bbq, if I want meat covered up with sauce I would get a McRib at McDonalds.  I travel a lot and get the chance to enjoy a variety of BBQ around the country so maybe my standards are too high, but I am a certified KCBS BBQ judge so I have an idea of what I am talking about.",

One grew up in Georgia and was a Georgia fan, not good for me, and her husband was an LSU fan, that went better than the Georgia part!  They were fun and gave me a full run of all their sauces so I narrowed it down to a couple mild ones and tried the brisket and the pulled pork.  Both were very good, and the serving size was generous.  It was a bit pricey, but I thought it was a fair price for the size of the serving.  Good Q ain't cheap, because it's a lot of work and takes an investment to make it right.    I had some great sides like I haven't had in awhile.  Overall a great experience and I noticed a guy delivering meat in a cooler from a local farm, Clarion Farms I think it said on his truck, very cool local sourced meet is always a good thing.    I'm always in search of good BBQ, and I enjoyed this place and will come back again!",

I must say....I have been on the search for a place that knows southern BBQ and found it. Great food, excellent (southern) hospitality and a wonderful time. Richard even brought us a few homemade hushpuppies as a surprise at the end of our meal. Thank you Deb and Richard! It was so nice to meet and chat with you while enjoying good, southern BBQ!

I also ordered a side of Mac and cheese and coleslaw.  The meats were not dry at all. They give you a big portion of pulled pork and the chicken was perfectly cooked. The sauces were just okay, maybe I just chose ones that I didn't really like, but I didn't really like the sauces that I chose. But the meats themselves were really flavorful and well cooked. The sides were delicious! The Mac and cheese was to die for and the cole slaw was really good.   The prices for everything can be a little steep but honestly BBQ is always a little pricey and I don't get it often, so I can't really gauge prices. However, you get a decent portion of the meats and also the sides. I think all my food including a soda came out to a total of $18? I would consider coming here again if I was in the mood for BBQ. If we were able to give half stars, I think it would be more of a 3.5 stars, rather than 4. The service was really good and the food was out fast, everyone was really polite to me over the phone and in person when I went to go pick up my food; so that's a plus.",

    "text": "If you like good BBQ, and if you like good Southern food, then you should love Yinzburgh BBQ. This eatery is owned by the same couple that own the popular Meat Here food truck as well as the sit-down restaurant of the same name in Oakland.   Yinzburgh BBQ is not a cozy or downhome BBQ joint. It's a shopfront with some seating both inside and out. While not particularly pretty, the greatness is all in the food, and isn't that really the point?   Low and slow BBQ that even spoiled Southern eaters will enjoy heartily is what this eatery is all about. Also, they offer real-deal Southern dishes like collard greens, black eyed peas, hoppin' john and stewed tomatoes 'n okra. The last dish is what brought me to this BBQ hotspot. I really love and miss okra, and especially boiled or stewed okra, not the usual dried up fried okra that can occasionally be found up here in the North.   The stewed okra/tomatoes were wonderful and made for a delicious breakfast the next day. I had a two meat combo plate with beef brisket and pulled chicken. The brisket was flavorful but just a tad bit dry. I was very pleased that it was not cut until I ordered it. I have found that most BBQ places here in the North have the very bad habit of slicing or shredding brisket and then keeping it warm. This ruins it by rendering it dry. I enjoyed the delicious homemade spicy honey mustard sauce with my pulled chicken. What a great combo. They have about six sauces to complement the various types of meat. My second side was an unremarkable Mac and cheese. Not bad, just nondescript. Of the handful of times I've been to YinzBurgh BBQ, they have always been out of cornbread.  This might be just as well because as I'm from Texas, I prefer savory cornbread, not sweet.   This is one of the best BBQ I've eaten in Pittsburgh.",

They have seven house-made bbq sauces, and the woman kindly allowed me to try them before choosing. I chose the honey-based one; itt's a nice combination of sweet, tangy and spicy!  The brisket was amazing! It was so tender I couldn't pick it up with a fork to dip into the bbq sauce. The flavor was great as well as it was cooked perfectly. I found myself scraping the bottom of the foil for all the little pieces that broke due to the extreme tenderness. At first the mac n cheese looked dry but much to my surprise, it was very cheesy and flavorful. Before leaving, the woman informed me that my mac n cheese had been freshly made which I very much appreciated. Is it better than my mom's? No, but I'll take it. And finally the cole slaw, it's mayo-based and it wasn't that flavorful. I liked that the veggies were finely chopped, but I had to add the bbq sauce for some flavor.   The physical location is not big at all, and does not have much seating. However, the good news is that they offer catering for large groups!   Whether for business or pleasure, I'll be returning to this spot!",

Anyway, let's try it again: For Pittsburgh they're a five star BBQ joint (most of the time) and for other parts of the country known for BBQ they're a four. I gave an overall rating of four because on my latest visit I crunched at least four pieces of bone in my pulled chicken sandwich. Aside from that horrific experience, the smoked chicken flavor with the standard sauce had nice backyard cookout taste.  The brisket sandwich is tender with the same backyard cookout flavor.  There are several different sauces, the hottest being called \"after burner\", which does have a kick. But I've definitely had spicier sauces. The tomatoes and rice and tomatoes with okra are really delicious. I love, love, love the macaroni and cheese. So over the span of 6-7 visits I'd say overall it's been a good experience.

I wanted to get party platters for a 20 person party, and they worked with me on the phone to make sure it fit my budget and somewhat complicated dietary restrictions of my guests (but allergies and vegetarians). When we went to pick it up, we were treated to a taste test of all the sauces and even the sides we didn't choose.   The packing of the food was really nice and easy to transport. Nothing spilled and everything was easy to set out and serve. Plastic serving utensils were included.  The food itself was absolutely delicious. All my friends loved it and it was perfect for a party environment. (We got chicken, pulled pork, Mac and cheese and black eyed peas.) We had the perfect amount of food, so people could even get seconds.  The owner was nice enough to call two days later and check up on how everything went.  Would absolutely recommend.",

A taste of all of the barbeque sauces (not surprising) but also all of the sides! The food was some of the best barbeque I've ever had.  All of the sides were amazing.  All of the sauces were multidimensional.  The meat was \"fall-off-the-bone\".  I didn't try any of the sandwiches or wraps, but the owner did give us a taco the were trying out, and let me just say, I don't really care much for tacos but it blew my mind! The owners were so friendly and helpful.  If you're looking for excellent southern food and/or barbeque, look no further!",

    "text": "I have visited YinzBurgh several times since they opened, and am impressed with how they've improved over the years. On my most recent stop, I had a brisket/pulled pork combo, along with mac and cheese, and their Chili Q.  Both the pulled pork and brisket were moist and tasty, but did need BBQ sauce to punch up the flavor. If you like mustard based sauces, you owe it to yourself to try their Honey Gold sauce. The mac and cheese has always been solid (flavorful, and not greasy), but my favorite item is their Chili Q, which is chili with delicious brisket. How brilliant of a concept is that? One of my buddies had a brisket/mac and cheese wrap, which he was happy with, and I will try the next time, just because it sounds so ridiculous.  I always enjoy the food at YinzBurgh, but I think their prices are a touch high for the portions that you receive. The store is clean, and the staff is very friendly, and pretty quick, too (quickness tends to be a trait that few barbecue shops have, in my experience).  If you're in the neighborhood, and are in the mood for tasty barbecue, give YinzBurgh a try.",

There are some downsides. It's a little pricey, the coleslaw was boring, and there's really no room for seating (my group of 5 was split between 4 stools and a regular chair).  That all said, this place will definitely be a regular stop.",

The portions are big enough and the sides are hearty and pair with the main dishes extremely well.   Parking has never been an issue for me, but given the location I could see it being a problem at peak times. The staff has always been very friendly and helpful and they love to let you sample the different sauces and impart their knowledge of bbq on new customers to make sure they have a great experience. Not only do they serve southern cuisine, but they do so with a healthy dose of southern hospitality.  The menu is full of interesting and unique meats and sides and they even offer smoked tofu dishes for the vegan crowd to enjoy. Honestly the hardest part of going there for me is trying to figure out what I want because it all sounds and smells amazing. I usually settle on the brisket or pulled pork and have yet to be disappointed by either, so I wholeheartedly recommend those to first time visitors.   Honestly my only complaint is that they have strange hours, and more than once I've stopped by after work hoping to grab some grub to take home only to find the doors locked. If they fixed that and offered delivery this would be my favorite place in the city.",

    "text": "While my Partner In Cuisine (PIC) and I were wandering aimlessly around Shadyside looking for a place to have a late lunch yesterday, we decided to take the lesser traveled Baum Blvd. instead of the usual Centre Ave.  The more upscale local places weren't open for lunch so those were out.  We vetoed Ritters (not quite drunk enough to eat there), the hot foods section at Market District (avoid grocery stores the day before a holiday) and the various chain restaurants that adorn the streets of Shadyside (because chain restaurants suck.)  Tired and hungry, we walked and walked when all of the sudden in the distance, I spot a sign.  \"That sign says Barbecue,\"  I said.  To which the PIC promptly replied, \"We are eating there.\"  We were so excited, we didn't even go to an intersection to cross and took our lives in our hands by crossing the four lane highway a'la \"Frogger\" to get to YinzBurgh BBQ.  This is not an easy task since most Pittsburgh drivers are completely psychotic (especially the PAT bus drivers.)  So we get to the restaurant and are greeted by the friendliest business owner this side of the Mason Dixon line.  Richard, the owner discussed our barbecue and sides options at length while he educated us on the \"whys\" and \"hows\" of authentic barbecue.  We got to sample the sauces and the sides before ordering, which was an extremely smart idea on his part because we ended up ordering WAY more food than we intended.  I got the ribs and pulled pork with a side of mac and cheese and the PIC got the chicken and brisket with the side of Chili-Q.  Both of us selected the signature red afterburner sauce.  Each and everything we had was excellent and we ate until our hearts content.  Of our four meats, the brisket and the ribs were the winners.  As a side note, for those non-carnivorous folks out there, there are also a plethora of vegan and vegetarian choices.     The reason why I give four stars instead of five was the lack of seating options.  If I wanted to go out with a group of friends for a good old fashioned barbecue dinner, the restaurant would not be able to seat more than a few of us.  I suppose one could get take out or delivery, but sometimes a person just wants a nice sit down meal.  Lucky for us, the day we stopped in, the weather was cooperative and we got to sit outside and dine.  If they had better seating, I think they would go far.    I also agree that the owners should just allow customers to squeeze their own barbecue sauces and try them on their meats as they eat.  In the long run, I think there would be far less waste.",

The Mac and cheese was prepared beautifully with some black pepper and was amazing .. Cole slaw was different but like I said this place is UNIQUE! The corn bread was grainy but very tasty!

Since we hadn't he gave us a little chat about the kind of BBQ he did, and allowed us to try all 5 (6?) sauces, all made in house. Our favorite was the after burner - very delicious! Then while eating the owner brought us over a sample of the smoked short ribs that would be on the menu for the weekend. All we could say was wow!

Brisket was our faverite, tangy collard green paired nicely with all the meat.  The kids devoured their mac and cheese.  Overall this was an unexpectly nice dining experience considering this was a take-out.",

He is so friendly and he always makes me feel like he really appreciates me trying anything from Yinzburgh BBQ.  I love the Afterburner sauce. I could just drink it I also like the Hot Honey. I've tried pulled pork, chicken, and ribs and they were all so delicious. As sides I've tried cole slaw, collard greens, and chili-Q. Chili-Q is something in between of baked beans and chili. It's so flavorful. The only thing for me is that it is somewhat pricy for a poor college student like me. So every time I go it's such a treat for me.",

    "text": "Reconnect with traditional, primal cooking, let the subtle flavors of smoke and meat tickle your pallet unencumbered by over salted rubs and sugary sauces.  Warning: BBQ snob here who has been burned more than a few times by \"awesome pittsburgh BBQ\" places. If this offends you stop reading now.  Finally, real BBQ in Pittsburgh.  BBQ is a process not a sauce people! It involves cooking with smoke! If there is no smoke it's not BBQ (cough) smokey bones (cough)  The last time someone from Pittsburgh raved about a BBQ joint to me it was Clem's Hardwood Cafe... Terrible- so much heavy handed use of sauce ... i think it might have been pork i was eating? Not really sure, could have been tofu, all i tasted was the sauce.  Now enter YinzBurgh BBQ:  Good BBQ does not come out of a crock pot and is not covered in sugary sauce.  In fact, I won't be surprised to find out that this place gets a few bad reviews for not having enough sauce.  Develop a pallet people!  Anyway, the smoke flavor is nice and assertive. The rub on the smoked chicken wings is quite excellent.  I can't comment on the bread as I don't eat much bread myself and am perfectly content to chow down on a plateful of meat.  Some have complained that the meat is served too plain, however if you are a backyard BBQ enthusiast then you will appreciate the smokey flavors, which don't require heavy handed use of sauces and rubs to mask inferior cooking techniques.  If you want to sauce your meat he has a number of homemade sauces available, however this place meets my #1 criteria for BBQ: Does not require sauce, although I did enjoy dipping my meat in a bit of sauce. My one complaint would be I would want sauces on the table so I could try a little of everything.  The staff: Super friendly and we exchanged backyard BBQ tips including foiling, brining, cooking temperatures, gear... I mean this guy loves BBQ and knows his stuff and is happy to chat you up about Q. Had a great time. I hope that they are able to be successful and get into a location with some seating and of course BEER!  UPDATE:  I have revised my rating to 4 stars down from 5. If they get squeeze bottles with their sauce on the table vs forcing you to choose just one sauce then it'll go back up.",

It is not as flavorful as Smoq's.  The cole slaw was good and the cornbread was just okay, but the BBQ sauces we tried were the best we have tried in Pittsburgh.  We tried three sauces, and each was excellent.  I especially liked one that seemed to have a bit of chipotle flavor.  The service was friendly, and we were able to find street parking just around the corner.  If you love BBQ, you must try this place for the good brisket and outstanding sauces!",

    "text": "Wow. It really doesn't get much better than this place. I'm from CNY where we have a pretty well regarded BBQ joint (Dinosaur) and my husband is from North Carolina and grew up eating tons of southern BBQ. We were bound to be tough critics. Part of my deal is I haven't eaten meat in over 10 years so my recent history with BBQ has been, well basically non-existent. Holy cow was I pumped when I found out how vegetarian friendly this place was. BBQ places in Pittsburgh are quite rare but one that has vegetarian options...shut the front door. It was too good to be True.  My husband and I, hungry for lunch and settling in for a night of drinking, thought it was as good a time as any to make our inaugural trip to YinzBurgh. We're sad we didn't go sooner. Upon walking in we were asked if it was our first time there. We confirmed it was and we were given a detailed tasting tour of all the sauces. I'm a pretty picky eater (I know right, the vegetarian is a picky eater?! no one saw that coming) but I legitimately loved all of the sauces. I really am easily annoyed when talked down to but the owner did such a great job of giving us tons of information without talking to us like we were stupid. It was a treat just tasting all of the sauces. We then placed our orders. I went with the tofu block and mac and cheese. I got to pick three sauces that went with the tofu. Seriously, delicious and fun! As our food was prepared we talked a bit with the owner. Such a nice friendly Southerner, really enjoyed him.  We got our food home and dove right in. The tofu was seriously amazing. I went with the KC sauce for it and holy crap, it was out of this world. The tofu was moist and flavorful. And the KC sauce with it was amazing. So much BBQ deliciousness in my mouth. It was heavenly, I inhaled it. The mac and cheese was sooo good. It was cheesy and rich. It was the ideal BBQ mac and cheese. I ate way too much of it.  It was a touch on the pricey side but it was worth every penny in my book. I'd go back as often as possible. Especially recommend for vegetarians, not very often that we're able to enjoy the smoky deliciousness of BBQ. Go eat here!",

    "text": "I haven't checked into YinzBurgh BBQ yet, but I can give an honest review after eating the food here. Let me explain, fellow  vegan and good friend, Jamie had gone here a few times and raved about the smoked Tofu with the greens and black eyed peas as sides. So we had made plans to meet and order some flicks at his apartment. So after his shift at Shadyside Hospital he went to YinzBurgh and picked up dinner and I went to 99bottles and got a couple sixers for the feast. I also stopped at Walmart (still sucks by the way) and picked up a can of Bush's grillin' beans and headed over.   The timing was perfect as he pulled up the same time I did, so the food would be good n' hot, all we had to do was throw the beans in the nuker and feast. I popped open a Dogfish Head 60 minute IPA , which goes great with a vinegar based BBQ sauce. I added the tomato based sauce to the baked beans to give em a little home made touch. The green were delicious and the black eyed peas equally good but the smoked tofu with that sauce was outstanding. Nice and firm, and just the right amount of smoke. yinzBurgh's tomato based BBQ sauce took a can of baked beans to new heights too. This is a great place that even caters to vegans and vegetarians who happen to love BBQ.",

I had the pulled pork and ribs, my wife had the brisket and ribs, both meals were great.  The owner came out a few times to check on everyone,  as I said, unmatched service, including the person taking orders. The food earns 4 stars, the service kicks it to 5 stars.

Excellent collard greens, nicely flavored mac and cheese, great cole slaw, and flavorful black eyed peas.  Southern cooking.  As for the meat?  The dry rub on the ribs is quite good, and it was soft and tender.  The 1/4 chicken didn't have crispy skin and was a bit dry.  The pulled pork didn't have seasoning, which I didn't know if that is a style or not.  I agree with the other reviewer that the buns were store bought - and if not, they certainly tasted like a bun you get from a summer camp bbq.  It's hard not to root for the store and owner, who clearly has pride in his food.  He dissuades you from calling in an order too far ahead of your arrival, lest your food not be as fresh as possible.  And as described, it's not a sitdown place, with only a few tables and, well, no place to sitdown.  I can't compare this place to others in the 'burgh - Union Pig and Chicken and Showcase BBQ -- as I have to fit these meals into my P90X nutritional program.  I think this joint is worth checking out, however, of you're in the area.",

Their cole slaw wasn't my favorite, but the red cabbage slaw had a sweet taste that complemented the savory meats.  The corn bread is buttery and sweet.  Best of all, the price was affordable for a BBQ restaurant.",

    "text": "I don't want to rain on this parade of generally positive reviews but I feel the need to weigh in with a dissenting view. It's not all bad: it's a mixed bad. The staff is crazy friendly and the decor looks like it was pieced together from scraps left behind by a local and not particularly successful amateur theater troupe. It's low-key to the point that you question whether you've actually entered a building certified to sell food. Behind the counter however, you can see the kitchen at work in a glorious bustle of brining and dry-rubbing that lets you know, yes, what you are eating is, in fact, genuine home-cooked barbecue that presumably meets all health and safety standards.  The owner is a really friendly guy; when you walk in, he asks if you've eaten there before and, if not, delivers his spiel on what he does: dry-rubbed barbecue, sauce on the side, have you tried the sauces by the way? The three varieties are sweet red, sweet yellowish, and sweet with vinegar. I get it, you can't have barbecue without sweetness but he may have driven the point home a little too thoroughly.  I got the pulled pork sandwich (priced at 8.50 including a side) and it was merely alright. I picked the coleslaw and carolina vinegar sauce because, really, that is the only way to eat a pulled pork sandwich. The bun is store-bought, slightly sweet, and thoroughly mediocre. Without the slaw on top, the bun and the tender pork would have been too uniformly textured to enjoy especially when doused in sauce. The pork itself tasted like smoked pork that had been dry-rubbed (surprise). I wouldn't call it bland, but it would've benefited from more salt. If you need smoked meat (don't we all), this is one of the few places in Pittsburgh to get it. The price is alright and the food is passable, if not great, barbecue.  I'm not writing this place off; I still need to try their ribs before judging them completely. I like barbecue but found my sandwich boring. Maybe the portions are better for the non-sandwich options but I could eat more for less elsewhere. I'd also like to explore their sides more. The black-eyed peas were fantastic.",

    "text": "A group of us visited YinzBurgh BBQ on a Sunday afternoon, after a short debate on which Pittsburgh-area BBQ place we should visit. YinzBurgh was the closest we haven't yet tried out, so that settled it.  Arriving, we didn't know what the parking situation would be, so we parked on side streets around the corner, but in their front door they have a sign indicating that customers are allowed to park in the Einstein Bros. lot across the street in the afternoons - convenient!   Walking in the restaurant, the barbecue smell hits you, and it smells amazing. The cheerful woman behind the counter asked if it was our first time visiting the establishment. When we told her it was, she offered samples of all five of their sauces, which is great because I would've just ordered one based on the description and the one I'd have picked definitely wasn't my favorite after the taste test. I ordered a beef brisket sandwich, while between all members of my party, we had a great selection of different meats, probably almost if not all of them. Another point - they do have vegetarian options (we didn't try them), but that's really cool to see a BBQ joint offering options for non-meat-eaters!  Now, our biggest problem - there were six of us but the seating area only accommodates four. Totally our fault for not realizing this going in and choosing to eat there instead of getting takeout, but they do actually have a pretty good sized space and I hope they offer a few more seating options as they continue to grow in popularity.  Onto the food: amazing. I got the beef brisket with their hot mustard-based BBQ sauce on the side, and it was without a doubt the best brisket I've had in Pittsburgh. The meat itself stands on its own, but I'm still into throwing a bit of sauce on. I managed to sample pretty much everything between what others in our party had ordered, and everything was great. The mac and cheese as a side was delicious, as was the cornbread (and a huge helping of it to boot). As we finished up, the cook (and potentially owner?) came out from the back and ensured everything was good, and was delighted to hear we enjoyed our meals.  Our whole experience here was great, and I'll definitely be back for more!",
