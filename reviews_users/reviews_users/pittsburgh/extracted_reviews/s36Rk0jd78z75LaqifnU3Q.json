We went on a Friday at dinner time and there was no wait at all.  My husband & I each ordered a different vegetarian selection and found both to be a notch below mediocre. The potatoes tasted like they came from a box, (though I didn't ask) the sauce on my enchiladas was overcooked, sticky, and a little burnt-tasting, and the beans reminded me of the ones they have at Taco Bell. The margarita was overly sweet and sort of tasted like Kool-Aid. Our server was rude (she tossed our guacamole onto the table as she walked past from enough distance that it actually slid to the other side of the table) and unpleasant.   Judging from many positive reviews and friend's recommendations, we must have gotten them on a bad day, and will likely give this place another shot and will update the review at that time.",

I am so glad we tried it that first time because in my opinion it's one of the best authentic Mexican restaurants in the area.  I had been to the Frankstown Rd location numerous times and most recently I dined at the new restaurant.  I was thoroughly pleased with the new restaurant - same menu, same prices & fresh decor.  They have a huge selection of dishes and the portions are great.  I also love the original margarita on the rocks (large size - of course).  The service is attentive, efficient and friendly.  The food is top-notch.  I have never had a bad experience here.  It was sad to see Rey Azteca leave Penn Hills.  However, they definitely made a good decision in relocating to Penn Center East.

    "text": "Okay, had to try this place. Heard it was good from some friends who had dined there when it was in Penn Hills. They are now in the Penn Center East Complex. I think they have four other locations widely dispersed outside of the Pittsburgh City Limits. Three of us went on a Friday and all were pleased with our meal. I would say the atmosphere is a little plain, nothing fancy, but not bad, pleasant enough. We were seated at a booth for four, but there are smaller booths, larger for 6 booths and some tables. We were greeted at the door immediately and swiftly taken to a booth in the center of the restaurant. A server brought us salsa and chips immediately. The chips were warm and crispy and the salsa was a good medium spicy style with good body.  We had a little bit of a hard time explaining we wanted a pitcher of Margaritas so he got the 'manager' I guess and we discussed the margarita situation. The had plenty of various flavors but only sold the 'lime' flavor by the pitcher, so that was or order on the rocks. I would say certainly not near the best but the mix was okay with a very lime taste and not much complexity. Food-wise they have a pretty good size menu with Chicken, Pork, Shrimp and Beef sections. Also Burritos, Fajitas, House Specials, Vegetarian specials, Combination Platters, Al La Cart, a Children's menu, Salads and some deserts; plus a good sized Lunch Menu. Very complete with so many choices for your tastes. For the unfamiliar they have a section with descriptions of about 20 Mexican dishes.  For example Taquito - Fried Corn tortilla rolled Chicken or Beef.  We ordered 3 dinners: Shrimp, Pork and Chicken dinners. For Shrimp we ordered the Camarones Al Mojo de Ajo, which is grilled shrimp with Mexican Garlic Sauce and lettuce, guacamole cheese, Rice and Flour Tortillas on the side. The shrimp in this dish were plentiful and cooked to perfection they were good size not tiny and very delicious. Would certainly order again. Almost every place of this nature overcooks shrimp so this was so nice to see the proper cooking attention.  For our Pork meal we ordered the Pork Carnitas. This was a very ample portion of fried pork with Tomatillo Sauce, Rice, Beans and flour tortillas. The pork was very tender, juicy and well seasoned. A real hit. Order again.... heck yes.   On the Chicken side we ordered from the Especialidades (specialty) menu and got the Enchiladas Verdes which is three shredded chicken enchiladas with Green Tomatillo Sauce, lettuce, sour cream tomato and a piece of steak on the side. Steak on the side was a pretty unusual accompaniment for me. The chicken was highly flavored inside tender wrappers topped with the aforementioned adornments. Now the green sauce is not my favorite, but the flavor and tenderness of the chicken made it a real winner.  I can't attest for authentic, but my one of our companions who has been to Mexico several times says this food matches up pretty well. So on his word and my taste buds I would recommend a trip here. We will certainly be back to try more of their very good food.",

I had made the sometimes-annoying drive out of the city to their old location in Penn Hills quite a few times, but recently stopped in to their latest location while in Monroeville. What an improvement!  That's not a comment on the food, though. The food was excellent, as usual, but the new restaurant is much larger and cleaner than the old fast food joint they were in before.  My favorite dish is the enchiladas rancheras. It's the one dish that no other Mexican restaurant in the city can come close to matching. Their ranchero sauce is awesome! Other than the enchiladas, Rey Azteca gives you a ton of delicious food for a reasonable price, and the service is fast and pleasant.  It's nice to see that Rey Azteca hasn't lost its touch with the additional locations that they've added over the years, and I can't emphasize enough how happy I am that they have a location closer to Pittsburgh. It's worth the drive!",

Though I am a strict El Campesena guy when it comes to Mexican in the area, I am starting to veer towards Rey's. I mean this is crazy for a kid that LOVES El Camp, especially after only ONE visit to Rey's.   I don't if it's my selfishness, that I don't like new places or environments, but the new El Camp is missing something that it had at the old Pappin's. So after only one visit I am willing to brake my loyalty to El Camp and give Rey's a run.  My recommendations at this joint are very rough & limited. But the sauce on there Enchiladas is fantastic. Don't know if that's what there calling there mole, but it's rich in smokeyness. This must mean there is Adobo sauce involved which is NEVER a bad thing. The right amount of heat so no hot sauce is needed (well, for me).  The chips and salsa aren't even close to the quality of El Camp. Though I do like a thicker chip, these were just bland. The salsa is very jar tasting to this jedi.  My meal made up for more than what they offered in chip & salsa department. So I have to give it Rey's for stepping into the ring with other Mexican restaurants in the area.  Jedi Recommendations;  * Enchilada * Burrito  * Taco (WAY better than El Camp)",

Seriously, go order, and start a stopwatch.  Your food will be there so fast.  You'll giggle.  Anyway, the guacamole is always fresh, the tortillas are hand-made on site, and the beef and chicken dishes are great.  They have several vegetarian options.  I've never tried any of the fish items, because the chicken flautas are deep fried ecstasy.  In retrospect, I never want to see calorie counts for this place.  They are good with kids, and will usually give little ones a sealed container for water (smart people).  While they don't seem to have the high lard content one will find in South Texas, I'm not sure that's a bad thing for those of us over 18 years of age.  (Oh, I miss you metabolism).  The only caution I would extend is they seem to add jalapanos to their refried beans, which can be an issue for the northern palate.  Those of you who love hot food will find this note amusing, but those of us who are total heat-wimps should be warned.",

As we walk in the door, ALL of the chairs are turned upside down and sitting on the tables, except for the ones that were occupied by a few patrons. It was 8:30pm. The posted restaurant hours, which I didn't realize, say that it closes at 9pm. So a full 30 minutes before closing time. I don't know what kind of place that spends money to put in a FULL BAR closes at 9pm on a Wednesday. I am sure they do a killer lunch game given the proximity to Penn Center. But seriously, having the chairs up on tables 30 minutes before close is a bit much. We couldn't even go to the bar to sit to have one beer, while we decided where the heck else we had to go because this place closes at 9.  I admit I am writing this review in a state of hanger. All I wanted was a cold beer and Mexican food. Probably a burrito.",

We shared a lime margarita on the rocks that was good, but a bit too sweet for me. He ended up finishing it. The chips and salsa was very good. We got a cheese cake chimichanga for dessert and it was the perfect ending to our meal. Our waitress was very nice and courteous. We will be back if we ever get back to Pittsburgh!",

There were other staff members bringing us our drinks, food, and chip refills like thirty seconds after we asked for more. The menu has pretty much everything you need from a mexican restaurant. I give this place 4 stars because I don't think the quality of the restaurant is stellar. But it's great if you want to get away from the Americanized Mad-Mex-esque places. Last night we had a chicken burrito, chicken fajita, and a beef soft taco. There was some confusion on the single beef taco and they had to fix it twice, but were super kind and patient for my picky cousin! I tipped a little extra for their effort, it was greatly appreciated. The fajitas were straight forward, the chicken pieces were smaller, but overall they were good. The refried beans and rice were actually really delicious as well! The staff graciously brought us extra sour cream and cheese when we asked and didn't charge us extra. Don't miss out on the margaritas!!",

I had been going to this place when they were up at the top of Rodi Road in Penn Hills about 3 years ago and their lunches were delicious and only $4.50  Since the move the menu has changed twice and gone up to $7 and $8 for the same amount of food which is almost double. I bit down on my taco and got a big sharp chicken bone that almost punctured my mouth. After that the whole experience was a turn off. All 3 of us in our party said we will not go back.",

It's a huge plate of no less than 10 plump grilled shrimp with their delicious cheese sauce over it, beans, and guac salad for between $6-$7 during lunch time.   I've also haid their tacos, fajitas, carnitas, and salads and every time I have been. This place has so much actual flavor in their food and nothing tastes like it was from a can and reheated.

First thing I notice when we're seated: their beer is crazy cheap (finally Pittsburgh! ;)! Under $3 for domestic and Mexican imports. Kudos to you, Rey Azteca.   We split a fajita for two, which came with the usual toppings and sides. I was a little bit disappointed to see that the food wasn't really authentic (cheddar cheese and lettuce? Boo.), but the fajitas were delicious as was the chips and salsa.   Service was really good, though we were one of two parties in the restaurant at the time lol. My only complaint was that for majority of our meal the music was way too loud! Someone eventually turned it down, but it cracked us up, honestly.   Only thing they're missing, imo, is a bar. I think that place would do great with a small bar in it, but what do I know? :)",

It took forever to have my drink refilled and then sat at the table for 10+ minutes before they asked if I wanted the check.   Completely unacceptable.  I wouldn't waste my time or money at this restaurant.  I could deal with service if the food was special but it tasted like any other mediocre Mexican restaurant that I've been to.",

The new location is much nicer than the previous location which was a Burger King before it was turned in Rey Azteca. I wish I could tell you more about the food , but I always get the same thing. The Burrito Texicano. It has steak, chicken and shrimp and is absolutely amazing! Why mess with perfection, right? The margaritas are huge and not to be missed!

And I love the finds of lower priced household goods they find. Uncomplicated, easy to find what you need quickly, and you're on your way. Their pizzas are quite good and their prices cannot be beat, anywhere.",

I was super impressed with the taste, quality, and presentation.  I will be returning again if I am ever in the area!",

I initially thought it was OK, but the salt-lick effect kept building in my mouth.  Because I was so hungry, and I couldn't finish my meal, I decided to eat some of my husband's dish.  I also took a much-needed Zantac.  When the waitress checked on us, I told her my food was too salty and that I could not eat it anymore.  She said that sometimes the cooks change shifts and some like to use a lot of salt.  I asked if there was a way to discount my meal, since I could not finish it and since I was eating some of my husband's dish.  She said she would check with her manager.  Moments later, she returned and said the manager said I should have complained sooner and that there would be no discount.  I thought this response was lame.  She asked if that was OK and I said nope.  I didn't feel like complaining beyond this effort since I was pretty tired.  I would not return to this place.  They don't seem to care about whether or not the customer is getting a good meal and whether or not they will come back.",

We arrived there at 8PM, and it looked like they were already putting the chairs up.  Really, 8PM is late to arrive?  We went for it anyway.  Next we noticed that they have two house margaritas, the regular sized for like $6, and a double-sized for just $2 more. Having had a hard day we order the jumbo (save the waiter and extra trip as well).  Here's what you get for your extra $2: twice as much generic margarita mix,  sickly sweet, and no extra tequila. Bad.  We were not off to a good start.  The food was equally unremarkable.  Flavorless beans, the standard iceberg lettuce salad (OK the guac is decent, but it should be, right?), and a  veggie burrito where the vegetables were practically raw and hardly seasoned.  I ordered the Mole Poblano because I love Mole and it was supposed to be sweet and spicy.  It was neither.  The Veggie burritos weren't finished, no box please, and (and this never happens) the margaritas were also not finished.   You'll notice that others have mentioned how ridiculously many items are on the menu.  That's usually a bad sign, and in this case it sure turned out to be.",

I decided on the Burrito Verdes which is two burritos, one shredded beef and on shredded chicken covered in a chile verde sauce! The margarita was very tasty. The burritos were both delicious! The service was good but the place looks pretty beat up. The booth I was seated on had a split open seat and the \"bar\" was covered in black plastic and non-operational! Bottom line is the food was very good, but the atmosphere was not really warm and inviting!",

The presentation is nice on small plates. :(  The food is BLAND. We had to add an entire lime to the guacamole to even make it edible. It also had too many onions and very little cilantro. Then we had to ask for hot sauces. I don't have to tell you how much of that we needed to use.  So, in the end, I do not recommend eating here.  There's other places in town.

The menus are a bit too much. It was a little hard to navigate and pick one thing. Anyhow, the wait was amazingly short. We got our food in ten minutes, at least. I'm an enchilada guy, and they didn't disappoint. My mom's a huge fan of chile relieno, and she said her's was perfect. Prices weren't even bad, either. If you're in the area, check this place out.   P.S. they were working on the bar when we got here two weeks ago, not sure if it's done it not. If you want to OD on margaritas, be sure to check first.",

I ordered a glass of wine and it did not come until almost the end of our meal. I think there were some minor communication problems, however once things were straightened out, we enjoyed a very very delicious meal as usual. We were also seated right next to the door, which I did not like at first but I let this go because I didn't feel like making a fuss. I did get a draft the whole time we were eating, which was unpleasant.  I know that sounds petty, but to me where you sit has a lot to do with the atmosphere while at the restaurant.   I ordered a cheese quesadilla which, had so much filling in it I didn't know what to do with myself. It was so delicious and steamy hot and the cheese just melted everything together. Usually quesadillas are thin, but this was more like a sandwich in thickness, and tasted so good I could go for one right now. My husband got a burrito with steak, chicken, and shrimp inside. He did not have any complaints and it was finished in no time.   One thing I wanted to mention was that the guacamole was such a small serving and we paid over four dollars for a side of this. I know avocados are expensive, but geez for that amount of guac and knowing the price k paid for the little tiny bowl (see photos), I could have picked them myself!   The complementary chips and dip are always a hit.  We had churro's for desert which, despite as being so incredibly full, we always make room for them and they hit the spot for sure. Other than a few small housekeeping things, we have few complaints.",

The chips were fresh and the salsa had good spice and a smooth consistency.  The menu is large with lots of different combinations.   To drink I ordered a large margarita and Bry had a negra modelo on draft. The margarita had great flavor. For dinner I choice chicken and cheese flautas. They were delicious. The chicken was moist and well seasoned and the guacamole it came with was also very good. The other half had a fajita dish with beef chicken and shrimp which is his staple and he enjoyed it. The little boy had a quesadilla and French fries. He ate almost all of it. Once it cooled down enough for him to eat it.   This was a great place for a meal. The staff is friendly and very attentive. The food is hot, fresh and comes out fast. Not much more I could ask for at a place like this.",

I've had better Mexican before but that was out west. If I'm in Monroeville I will come back.  Had the shredded chicken soft tacos with rice and retried beans. Service was excellent.",

We tried the fish tacos.  Places like Bakersfield in the city charge $4 for a decent fish taco.  Those come with an awesome spread and squirt bottle salsas.  These were $12.75 for 3 and were literally tilapia on a soft tortilla.  No frills for my coin.  Mexican food in this city is such shit.  People can validate by claiming to have lived in such a mexican food mecca before and how this place is the Greatest of Them All but people are generally idiots.",

I've never been  disappointed ordering from here and I love to order from them when I have a big appetite because I want to eat as much as possible while it's fresh.   One of my favorite orders is the Guadalajara especial...1 chicken & 1 beef taquito, 1 chx tamale, served over a bed of nachos topped with ground beef, shredded chicken, beans & rice, all topped with cheese sauce, sour cream, and guacamole. For $14 it is a hell of a lot of good food. It was at least 2, usually 3 meals for me and I eat a lot.  love it!",

Great deals on Tuesdays, $1 hard shell tacos with beef or chicken, and $2 off margaritas during happy hour during the week.

The first basket of chips  and one small dish of salsa is free but refills are a charge of $2.50 according to their menu. The margaritas were on special for $2 off but tasted no alcohol and I'm fairly certain based on a quick glance when it was being made and the taste that it had one shot in a frozen jumbo. When I asked about this and told them I didn't taste alcohol I was told it was two shots and sent back to my table with the same drink. Our food wasn't good with my Yogi special being bland and my husbands $16 chicken shrimp and steak fajitas being burned and almost jerky like, completely over cooked. When I was received the check the margarita wasn't discounted and it had to be brought to a manager's attention. We feel ripped off and will definitely not be back.",

There is ample parking with easy access in and out of the lot.   The staff here is super friendly and they greeted me and everyone else immediately upon walking in the door. The dining area isn't huge but it was large enough that you didn't feel like you were a part of your neighbors conversation.  The menu, my goodness, is massive. I almost got a headache after trying to figure out what I truly wanted to claim for my meal that evening. Options are good so no complaints there. We were served the usual chips and salsa but, quite honestly,  the salsa was the only thing I did not like. It lacked flavor and it was room temperature, not cold, not warm just not a good temperature for salsa,  if that makes any sense. It lacked any real flavor and just tasted like pulsed canned tomatoes to me...meh.  Our meals were very very good. We had a shrimp burrito and shrimp.....and they were amazing. The shrimp, cheese, beans, rice and side of guac were the real deal. Shrimp were cooked perfectly and seasoned well.   This is a great spot to add to our list...can't wait to try more of their menu!",

What is surprising to me is that this place is never busy. We are always in and out. No complaints about that, I just hope they stay in business.  Upon being seated you are served chips and salsa. The salsa is mild. I have ordered a few different things but I almost always get vegetarian #1 which is a cheese enchilada, bean burrito and bean tostada. It is traditional mexican and unbelievably good. My husband always orders the pollo adobe which is very thin chicken with lots of vegetables. They have a kids menu. We ordered my daughter a beef taco, rice and beans for $4. Super cheap. Speaking of, everything is very fair in price on the menu.  With fast and friendly service there is no doubt I will keep coming back as long as it is open!",

The carnitas in the burrito had the proper consistency and texture but were so over-salted they were practically inedible. I had to pull half of them out of the burrito in an attempt to be able to eat it. Highly disappointed with restaurant management's apathy, as I brought this to the attention of two of the floor/serve staff. I am writing this from my table, to see if anyone from management comes to speak with me. Apparently, management does not value customers or repeat business. I still left the server a 20% tip, as she was pleasant and served me with reasonable service. As for El Rey 3, BAD NEWS!  I definitely recommend avoiding this establishment unless you like overpriced salt and bad customer service.",

So bad I sent it back and ordered a diet coke. The waitress was not friendly.  The food was edible but not great. My shrimp was mushy and I am a little afraid that it may not have been cooked all the way.  So unless you like a terrible margarita and rude service,  stay away from this location.",

Upon arrival, we were quickly seated and greeted with salsa and a warm basket of chips. We placed our lunch order and it was served about 10 minutes later. Everything was fresh and hot. Our drinks never went close to empty and neither did our chips and salsa (we  asked for seconds and they didn't charge us!) A lot of patrons around us got dessert (the fried ice cream). It looked so good, but we were so full that we passed on dessert. This is definitely a place you'd want to visit if your hungry, but in a time crunch.
