The server was attentive but just seemed bothered to be at work. The manager stoped by and was polite but not over engaging in conversation by any means. I did like the glass wall to the kitchen. Food was okay. Steak was over cooked but I ate it anyway due to it taking to long to get in the first place. We enjoyed the evening but it definitely was not the best place I have been.",

We started with the seafood tower and it had some of the freshest seafood I have ever tasted. The lobster was perfect, the oyster and shrimp were huge and the crab meat was delicious. For dinner, my husband ordered the snapper and I had the 8oz filet and lobster tail. The steak was cooked to perfection and the blue cheese sauce on the side was the perfect complement. For dessert, we had the banana's foster, which I would highly recommend. The General Manager was walking around the whole night checking in on tables and was very friendly with all of the guests. I would definitely recommend Eddie V's to anyone looking for a perfect date night in Pittsburgh!",

This is my new favorite place. They have the best crab fried rice I have ever had in my life. It was better than any fried rice in a Chinese or Japanese restaurant. That's hard to believe but very True. I highly recommend going to try it. It won't disappoint. I'm looking forward to Christmas Eve dinner here.",

When we checked in both my husband and myself thought she was somewhat rude but brushed it off. We arrived 10 minutes early for our 7pm reservation so we we to the bar for a drink. We quickly realized they were very behind. Another couple next to us had a 7:15 reservation and they were seated before us, at this point it was 7:30. I went to the hostess stand to find out what was going on and the hostess was very dismissive and on the phone. I asked when we would be seated and she said we were next. I said okay but wanted to know why the other couple was sat before us and her response was they were not. They clearly were. Her tone and body language was not something I would expect at a restaurant in this price point. When we finally sat I requested a manager. She was extremely apologetic and offered us a free appetizer which I instead was not necessary. In the end the food was wonderful and the service was excellent. It's just a shame they have a low grade front of the house. Thats the first and last face you see.",

    "text": "We ordered the following: -Crab fried Rice - seemed directionless as a dish and like they threw crab meat on top of it. Wasn't a complete dish and lacked thought. Also seemed to be sitting in some sort of broth. Highly caloric for no reason. -Truffle Mac - best part of my dining experience but not because it was amazingly cooked. Just the most tolerable thing I ordered. Rue was too soupy. -TarTar - this was the worst thing I ate, hands down. The way the steak in particular was seasoned and prepared rendered it inedible and nausea inducing. Truffle was thrown on top but not expertly incorporated into the dish and the oil was overused. Lobster I only finished because the meat was such a good quality but it reminded me of a church picnic seafood salad. Too much mayo was used. And the crostini was so damn hard I could crack a tooth on it. Waiter was kind enough to take it off the menu -Calamari - my co-worker ordered and I ate most of it. Only thing that I didn't regret getting. Presentation was too much though. A lot of fluff on the plate of saturated garnishes. Wish they would have let the calamari be. It was ruined by whatever sauce they put on the plate though. Made the batter soggy and fall off the calamari. -Creme brulee - came out cold. didn't eat but my coworker was put off by it. -Complimentary bread and butter - bread was trash, butter was amazing For the price point of this restaurant, I expected a better fine dining experience. I won't go to another one, in any city. Pittsburgh ruined it all for me.",

I had a side dish, again generous serving, of grilled sweet corn with cilantro and jalapeno pepper. A perfect touch of sea salt made it the treat of the evening.  Even on a Saturday in August with the city half empty due to vacations the place was packed for our arrival at 7:00.   Reservations a must.",

The wedge salad was tasty too. For desert we had the creme brulee ,I recommend you share one it's a decent size . For a more relaxed time have dinner in the lounge near the live jazz band - which I believe perform each night .",

I called at about 7 and they said they could fit us in at 8:30. Second of all, our service was outstanding. Our server, Thomas, paid very close attention to us. He heard me tell my boyfriend I didn't love mushrooms and when he brought out our warm goat cheese, mushroom, and arugula salad, not only did he split the salad for us, but he put my mushrooms on the side. How thoughtful! My boyfriend had the pearl point oysters which were incredible. I had the steak and tuna tartare. We both liked the tuna better than the steak but it was still perfectly prepared. I had the filet medallions Oscar style and it was one of the best meals I've ever had. The steak was perfectly cooked as was the asparagus - I like mine a little crunchy, not soggy. My boyfriend had the halibut and the flavors and sauce went together incredibly well. We also ordered the Brussel sprouts which neither of us were a big fan, but it obviously won't keep us from returning. After our meal, we went to the bar for an after dinner drink and dessert. My boyfriend had the bananas foster...DELICIOUS. I had the smores dessert and it was okay-I would prefer a stronger marshmallow flavor. Last but not least, they have live music every single night. I hope this place keeps it up for the long-term as it will probably become one of our new favorites. I am excited to return with my mom...she will love it.",

We had the choice of sitting in the dining area or the \"lounge\" area and opted for the latter. There was a bar, high-top tables, booths, more festive lighting than the dining area, as well as live jazz music. The musicians were great and made the night fun for us!  Service was great from beginning to end. Started off with bread/butter and a couple drinks. The Maverick cocktail was delicious and refreshing, garnished with cucumber and a jalapeno. We ordered a half-dozen oysters, of which they had a decent variety. These weren't anything exceptional but they got the job done.   The real winner here was the meal. We ordered a 12 oz. filet mignon steak with a cognac-peppercorn creme sauce, the Norwegian salmon, a side of asparagus with hollandaise, and a side of broccolini. The steak was beautifully cooked to medium-rare and almost dissolved in mouth. With the cognac-peppercorn sauce it was incredibly delicious and we wanted to get another one! The salmon was flaky and cooked perfectly. Albeit a bit fishy, it was accompanied with vegetables and a mustard vinaigrette which definitely elevated the meal. We cleaned both plates!   A huge shoutout also to our waitress, who upon hearing of the achievement we were celebrating, brought us a dessert...on her! We chose the butterscotch panna cotta and I think it was the best dessert I've ever had. The caramel-like butterscotch sauce danced effortlessly with the panna cotta and walnuts. The dessert included a coconut macaroon and a biscuit, which we used to mop up the chocolate sauce \"Congratulations\" written on the plate. A perfect ending to our meal!",

    "text": "Ok... So this place was amazing.  We had the salt n pepper shrimp at the bar during happy hour which was divine!  Christopher made a perfect dirty martini and my man had the house Cab which he enjoyed. We had dinner reservations at 5:00 and started with the calamari and 2 oysters Rockafeller.  We both said the calamari just may have been the absolute best calamari we've ever had. It was so tender and delicious. Not too sweet. Not too spicy. It was perfect.  I had the Chilean Sea bass and he had the Twin filets. We also shared the butter poached lobster mashed potatoes and crab fried rice.  Everything was excellent. The crab fried rice had a little strong herb taste that neither of us were blown away by, but it was still delicious, just probably wouldn't order it next time. The lobster mashed were delicious but definitely over kill with all the other food we had.  Everything was so good, we just wanted to try it all.  We also had completely unnecessary desserts... the Godiva chocolate cake and creme brulee.  Again... excellent.   Brandan R was our server and he was an absolute JOY! He was genuinely concerned if we enjoyed everything, and more than attentive. Very personable and super sweet! Tony, the manager, also stopped numerous times to check on us, and make sure every step of the meal was perfect. He was so accommodating and hospitable.   Overall, we were thoroughly impressed by our first visit here and will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Eddie V's is probably one of my favorite chain restaurants ever! Especially because I LOVEEE seafood more than anything :) The boyfie really wanted to try this place before we left Pittsburgh so it wasn't hard to say yes :P I like how this location has a separate more \"casual\" dining/bar area. We opted to sit there since we were both in workout clothes LOL.  Ordered: x JUMBO LUMP CRAB CAKE (Sauteed Maryland Style with Spicy Chive Remoulade) - Boyfie can never say no to crab cakes so of course we ordered them. I'm not the biggest fan of crab cakes because of the breading, but these ones are DELICIOUS! Mostly all crab meat and very little fillers. Still one of our favorites next to the ones served at Joe's in Las Vegas. x MAINE LOBSTER TACOS (House-Made Fresh Tortillas with Grilled Sweet Corn Pico) - MMMM the best lobster tacos ever! I remember the tortillas being a little thicker, but these were still good! A MUST order. x BROCCOLINI WITH LEMON AND GARLIC - we ordered a side of this and it was so delicious! You could really taste the lemon on this dish which makes any vegetable taste good :P x CRAB FRIED RICE WITH MUSHROOMS AND SCALLIONS - this was also a side. We ordered the half portion which was still HUGE. Definitely easy to share between two people. I was hoping the crab was mixed into the rice, but they just plopped some on at the top. It was still really good.  We received our tacos and crab cakes fairly quickly, but our rice and broccolini took about 50 minutes which was ridiculous. Our server was super cool about it and took ownership of the delay. He took both off the bill which was great. Truly Eddie V's service. Little things like this will always keep me coming back!",

We started with the calamari which came highly recommended, west coast oysters (the ones at Off the Hook are better) and the apple salad (big enough to split). For dinner we ordered the bronzino, parmesan sole, ahi tuna and the special ribeye. Can't complain  about any of the entrees and the steak was cooked perfectly (probably the best steak in Pittsburgh). We were told that 3 sides would be good for 3 people, we order 2 (scalloped potatoes and broccolini) and had more than half of each to take home. Dessert portions were ginormous.   Minor hiccups - had to wait a little for a table that we had a reservation for and the drinks from the bar were slow.",

It came with no sides so i got the crab fried rice.  The fried rice had scrambled egg, mushroom and and crab in it and was maybe a bit overcome but again still liked it a lot.  Would rate the experience a solid 4+. If we ever go back to Pittsburgh I would bring my spouse here. service was very good and it was a lovely meal and experience, ambiance was really high end but I just ate in the lounge as I was all alone... Place was pretty dark and a lot of people were dressed in Pittsburgh Penguins jerseys so I'm guessing they have a game tonight...",

    "text": "So....I was looking forward to having my Birthday dinner here for a month, with my gorgeous woman, and when the day arrived, it was overall underwhelming.  The space itself is VERY classy, and our server, Larry, was excellent. I am rating 2 stars for these two variables alone. They knew it was my Birthday, and had some themed confetti tastefully strewn about the table cloth, along with a Birthday card, inside of which was a hand-written note wishing me the best. A lovely touch, really.  I ordered the 8 oz. filet, medium, and the South African Lobster Tail. The Mrs. ordered the Georges Bank Scallops entree, and we decided the side of Brussels sprouts would be a good accompaniment.  Bzzzzt. Wrong.  While my Lobster Tail was very good, it lacked the sweetness one would expect from such an expensive crustacean. The Mrs. had a bite, and found it to be \"dry\". I disagreed, but it was certainly not flavorful the way I'd expected.  My fillet, which was ordered medium, was more like medium-well...grey in the middle, and very dry. Yes, I could've sent it back, but, at this point, we were looking forward to ending the ordeal and leaving. My meal was $89.00  She didn't say a word, because she didn't want to spoil my special evening, but I could tell she wasn't enjoying her meal, either.  During our After Action Report, she told me she found her scallops to be too salty, with a \"gritty\" texture. Her meal was $37.00  The Brussel's sprouts....Oh, the Brussel's sprouts. A large dish of the offending vegetables were brought to us for the princely sum of $12.00, and they were the worst sprouts to ever go over the wall from Brussels. Soggy, tasteless, and lukewarm, I doubt a starving homeless person would've considered them. We each had a taste, and pushed them away.  As it was my Birthday dinner, Larry brought us desert on the house. A dark chocolate, toffee, something or other. Like a creme brulee brownie with toffee and chocolate. It was delicious, and the best part of the meal, sadly. The Mrs. had 2 Chardonnays, I had 3.  Total bill, before tip.....$219.00 Now, here's the thing...I will gladly pay that and so much more, if the cuisine matches the price in excellence. Eddie V's failed here in a major way. I am not a Chef, but I can grill a filet myself, for free, infinitely better than the one I had last night. Scallops, as well.  I think, that next year, I will get some Costco steaks, and some jumbo scallops from Wholey's Fish Market, and save some money.  Definitely will not ever return to Eddie V's.",

    "text": "I discovered this restaurant during my business trip. It was still early evening, so the restaurant was not busy. But, when I told the hostess that I don't have a reservation, the hostess told me apologetically that even though they have several open tables, with the number of servers that they had at the moment, it was considered \"full.\" I asked her if I could sit at the bar, and she told me \"sure\" so there I went.  The back section near the bar, they had a live band playing mellow, jazz-y music with a female singer. The bar was a pretty good size, with a few TV screens for sports fans. It certainly was a fully stocked bar, and they had good drink menu.  I wanted an interesting cocktail, so when I saw \"Bananas Foster Martini\" I thought this is IT!  When the bartender brought the glass out and lit it on fire, I was super surprised!!! He poured semi-frozen drink into the glass still lit, until the fire died down and the drink was done.  For appetizer, I ordered Point Judith Calamari. I thought it was a bit pricey, but that was before I saw the size of this thing. It was humongous!!! If I had knows it was going to be this big, I wouldn't have ordered anything else... It was tasty though, mountain of tangy calamari, on a bed of crispy noodles. It was addictive, but then the more I ate, the more the sauce felt too strong and heavy.   For the main, even though I came here for seafood, I decided to get something lighter. So, I went with Miso Marinated Tofu. They had one large square of tofu, thick and filling. I wished it had more miso flavor than it had on it, as it was kind of tasteless on its own. Fried rice with veggies and cashews did had strong miso flavor, it was great with the tofu.   My server was the bartender since I was sitting at the bar. He was polite, friendly and took a good care of me.",

The host service seemed to still be working out the kinks and made us wait a bit, but the tableside service was good.  Our waiter was funny, informative and thoughtful.  He noticed I loved the bread and gave me two loaves :)  We had drinks to start - ok prices on those.  I ordered the lobster bisque.  Was a little light on lobster, but it was very good for $11.    For dinner, everyone in the group has different things and all we're delicious.  We got the halibut which was good. Scallops were extremely refreshing.  Shrimp stuffed with crab were awesome.  Tofu dish was surprisingly good.  Sirloin was cooked perfectly at medium rare and the sauce was perfect.  For sides, we got the truffle Mac which was very good, broccolini which was awesome.  Au gratin potatoes were a bit much for me, more cream and cheese than potato.  Brussels sprouts were average, oily and I've definitely had way better.  For dessert we got the Godiva chocolate cake and the bananas foster butter cake.  I enjoyed the chocolate cake much more than the bananas foster cake.  It was way too rich for me!  We had a great meal and actually liked the food here better than capital grille.  Lighter and they cook the steaks better.  Docking a star because I still cannot get on board with the prices of places like this.  It's good, but pretty sure those $52 dollar steaks could be $35-$40...",

    "text": "Soooo, saddest little story about Eddie V's. A coworker and I had gotten into habit of going to Eddie V's after work for cocktails and food(cocaine would have been cheaper) and I love it there. We had a pretty consistent order of oysters, tar tare and calamari. Well, we get oysters one night and the second set of them (we got 2 of 3 different kinds) turn out to be the best oysters I have ever had. Unfortunately, the waitress had never told us which were which and we had eaten them too fast to try and figure it out. Gosh. One of life's great mysteries!  Anyways, the appetizers are wonderful, truly! The prices are high but so is the quality. We do not live in a town where oysters should taste great but I order them anytime they are on a menu and I have to say Eddie V's is the best place to get fresh, unique oysters! The drinks are also wonderful, the staff is attentive and it has a really great classic but well-kempt upscale steakhouse vibe. There is nothing stale about this restaurant!",

    "text": "Awful overpriced crap! Had a night out at the theater with a 6:00 din rez with friends planned, they choose this spot. Dropped off my wife and found a parking spot about 4 blocks away.  By the time I got there she was still waiting to be seated even though she had requested to be taken to the table when asked. They said the table was ready but still seated 3 other parties behind her. I'm always alert to unfair treatment from white businesses towards black customers and they seemed to look right through my wife who is black. We were seated a few minutes after and there just seemed to be a general air of confusion once things got going. Every round, from drinks appatizers and main course came late and wrong. It's like they would come to the table and ask \"is this yours? Oh hang on, this goes to another table.\" Literally. And the food was BAD. My main course was a tiny portion of sea bass (I think) in a salty soy sauce liquid (supposed to be miso) and a crappy overcooked blob of wilted greens underneath. My wife had a skimpy portion of 5 tiny overcooked scallops with a couple spigs of some greens and almonds. To top it off, the server had asked us if we were going out afterwards and our friends had reminded them that we had to be at the theater at 8. We barely made it in time! This sub par meal with 1 drink, 1 appatizer, 2 soups and 2 main courses with tax and tip cost us $170. That's way more than we ever spend on dinner, but I would have been cool with it if the entire experience hadn't been such garbage. Eddie V's is a pretentious cash grab with no originality, class or style. I WANT MY MONEY, TIME AND LIFE BACK.",

I recommend self parking at Mellon Square or Forbes Garage.   Ambience/Restaurant- Very elegant and posh. Cool blue and candle lighting. Impressive wine selection and large liquor inventory. Great for a romantic evening or an intimate occasion. White table cloth and fine dining service. Live music every night at 6p. It's a little chilly so bring a jacket and warm clothes.  Dining Experience- Happy Hour starts at 5p with some cocktails and oysters (East and West Coast) then live music started at 6p. A warm transition into a great meal. Many seafood selections and a changing menu. Price point is high but it's worth it for the experience.  Service- They host seats you smiling and provides you details for the server and menu. Crumbs are taken off the table and your napkin is folded when you leave your seat with silverware exchanged for each course.  Overall- I loved it and it was a nice evening that I will remember. One of the finer dining establishments in the city.",

    "text": "I made a reservation for Eddie V's a couple weeks ahead of time to celebrate my graduation from a masters program.  I'd read a lot of great reviews and was excited for the experience.  Unfortunately the restaurant disappointed on quite a few fronts.  Strike 1:  I called the night before to see if I could move my rezzy up 30 min and the hostess confirmed.  My group of 8 arrives at 7:30 but the hostess hadn't updated my reservation.  This resulted in my large group having to wait 40+ minutes in the lobby before we were actually seated, 15 minutes after my original 8pm reservation.  Our waitress and the manager on call made up for it by giving us some appetizers, and I must admit the truffle mac and cheese was great - probably the best dish we experienced that night! Calamari was pretty good too.  Strike 2:  The restaurant was very busy because of graduation festivities, but we were patient in waiting to order. We did not, however, expect that it would take more than an hour to actually be served dinner.    When our dinner came out, the two bacon wrapped filets that we ordered medium rare were completely cooked through - medium well at best! My mom ordered the Chilean sea bass and said it was very dry.   Strike 3: Our waitress was very understanding and worked with us when we sent back the steaks.  After another 40 minutes, our new steaks came out very rare.  Sometimes you just can't win.  The lackluster experience kind of took the air out of the room and tarnished what was otherwise a great weekend.  To be fair to our waitress, she did all she could to help us out but the mistakes that were made were out of her control.  Our bill was adjusted to reflect the weak experience we had, but honestly I feel like a restaurant of this caliber shouldn't have made the type of errors we experienced.  I can cook a perfect medium rare steak at home, and I just learned how to spell sous vide yesterday!",

    "text": "Awesome food with unreal service. I celebrated my 28th birthday with my family and friends there at a large table. Ron our waiter was exceptional. Answering any question we had and very attentive. With my birthday being on Valentine's Day, it was obviously crowded but that didn't stop Ron from being with us every step of the meal and right on top of things. My only complaint was that the drinks took a little while to get to the table and they only had bottled Guinness. Everyone knows Guinness must be from a tap. At a restaurant like that they should know that!  The food came out prepared perfectly. We ended up getting a free order of crab fried rice (it was brought to our table by accident and he said to just keep it) which was a nice surprise! From all the food we had obviously I couldn't finish my my meal and I asked for my last crab stuffed shrimp and a little piece of my steak to go. About 4 minutes later Ron came out and said \"we had a little problem in the kitchen\" and explained that my plate had fallen and that they were preparing me a new steak and shrimp to go. Talk about unbelievable service. I ended up going home with a lot more than what I had left but Ron said it wasn't right if I didn't have leftovers so he really hooked up me.  Since it being my birthday they let me pick any desert on the menu. Awesome that I could pick.  Lastly it is not a cheap place to eat what so ever with a bill for 5 people over 500$ before tip so be prepared. I would for sure recommend though to anyone! Absolutely delicious and well worth the money!",

    "text": "My son picked Eddie V's for his Pitt graduation dinner.  And because our next-door neighbor's daughter was also graduation from Pitt, we invited them to join us.  I made an on-line reservation for 8 and added a note that we were celebrating the accomplishments of our two graduates.  The day before our reservation, I received a call to confirm our plans and was informed that all members of our party needed to be present before we could be seated and that our reservation would be cancelled if we were not seated within 15 minutes of our reservation time.  I wasn't thrilled with getting such a dire warning over the phone but I guess they were packed for the evening.  Our full party made sure we arrived on time.  We were seated in a private alcove and the table was decorated with star confetti for our graduates.  It pays to make a note on the reservation for special occasions.  My sister notified our waiter that she had gluten allergies and he made accommodations for her throughout the meal.  This was truly a five-star experience.  The food and service were outstanding, and the staff really went out of their way to make our graduates feel like they were the most important guests in the house.  They were both sent home with complimentary desserts and the rest of us were treated to a complimentary order of Bananas Foster for sharing.  Yes.. the final bill was an eye-opener, but I had no regrets rewarding the staff for their excellent service.  When we remember this graduation weekend, our meal at Eddie V's will be a prominent part of the conversation.",

So it is popular. Lots of drinking. The lounge has live music which is a real plus. Our appetizers and salads were very good, but in comparison, the entrees seemed like an anticlimax, with only a small solitary lonely little piece of fish on a too large dish without any accompanying sides. Then disaster stuck... I hit a vile tasting piece of fish and had to spit it out on my dish. This has never happened to me before. In My Life. So it was a new low. The pacing of the meal itself was off...too slow and took way too long. Seems like it took forever to get the entrees. My advice to the kitchen is, if the pieces of fish you have left are too small, or are questionable, save everyone the angst and take it off the menu. were never offered bread, or water refills. pricey $$$$",

All I can say is perfection.  I also like that they had some music playing, although it seemed extremely loud for the space and they didn't seem to play for very long. I thought they were just taking a break, but they never came back.  I guess my only complaint would be the ladies room.

First - the service: I felt like I had walked into a room where an argument had just taken place. There was no interaction, helpfulness, or friendliness between the staff. A  younger lady and a middle aged man constantly walked around (manger and maitre d'?) with stern looks, never a smile to the customers or  - forbid!- a stop by the table to see if everyone's enjoying themselves. Our waiter was friendly enough - to us - but didn't know the dishes as well as he claimed. He answered preparation questions incorrectly, we came to discover when our food arrived. Water glasses would be filled - for 1/2 the table. Dishes and drinks were slow to arrive. The main dishes were very slow to arrive - we were happy enough talking among ourselves and didn't ask about them, but our waiter stopped by 3(!) times to say the dishes would be out soon.  There was an excellent jazz trio playing in the bar area, one of the highlights of the experience. Yes, it was loud in the entire restaurant, but not as bad as others in this city - who don't have live music.   The food: I was served the caprese salad - 3 small to medium tomato slices, a tablespoon of cheese, on an very large plate for $15. Everyone looked at it when it was served and asked,\"where's the rest of the salad?\" All of the salads were small - the smallest wedge salad I've seen, and the Caesar wasn't much better. Taste was very good, though. We all had fish - 3 swordfish - small but excellent,and grouper, small also. The grouper is served on a corn fondue - if you don't know what that means don't feel bad. Our waiter didn't either, even though he gave a (completely wrong) answer when asked while ordering. It means basically a hollandaise sauce, with maybe some creamed corn in it? Fortunately it was under the fish, so the filet could be removed from the dish and enjoyed without it. The grouper itself was very good. We ordered a couple of side dishes, these were of a pretty good size - but one was the Brussels sprouts, and they were burnt. We eat and make Brussels sprouts frequently, I understand what the chefs were going for, but the fine line was crossed and they were burnt.  A couple of us ordered desserts, creme brulee and an apple cobbler. It took so long to arrive, we were sorry we had ordered them, but they were very good.  So, in summation : this is a chain (with 16 locations and growing). Pretentious atmosphere. Strange, slow service. Pretty good food, poor value. I really don't want to go back, and that's the final measure. In Pittsburgh, for the same cost or far less, there are so many better choices for dining.",

They had birthday confetti on the table and a nice personalized card for me.  They came out with a birthday toast of champagne on the house for me and my friends.  The food was absolutely delicious.  I had the Kung Pao Calamari, Crab friend rice, crab cake and jumbo stuffed shrimp.  To make things better....I brought my own cake in and they do not have a cake cutting fee.  #winning.  I cant wait to go back and try their happy hour and so many more items off of their menu.  There was also a band playing.  Just really a great experience there.  I appreciate the little extra things the staff did to make my birthday dinner really special.",

We did an early 5pm slot so we could go home and recoup before meeting friends later. We arrived early and were able to be sat immediately. We were greeted promptly when we walked in the door and we were offered to check our jackets. We decided to keep our jackets because we were still really cold.  Our server Mark was amazing. Really knowledgeable and friendly. Started us off with some champagne which was great. We had already looked over the menu at home and had made a few decisions. We listened to his recommendations. We decided on the crab cake appetizer, 12oz filet, 22oz lobster tail, crab fried rice, and lobster mashed potatoes. Everything was amazing. Mark said the side dishes were big told us to get the smaller portions. Honestly the food was amazing. The lobster tail was insanely big. We had enough food left over to have another meal later.  After dinner we were offered coffee and dessert. We got both. We shared the s'mores toffee and it was AMAZING. For the portion sizes the price justifies. Our waters/wine glasses were always full, everyone escorted you tables, bathrooms, etc. we got a great view of the kitchen.  I've worked in restaurants all my life. Watching these chefs create all these amazing meals so effortlessly was like watching an orchestra. It was really neat! Kudos for the great service and meal. We will be back!",

When I booked the reservation on-line the site asked if it was a special occasion, so I checked the box for birthday. When we arrived we were seated at a large corner booth with an excellent view of the restaurant and the table was sprinkled with birthday glitter along with a card. Dessert was on the house for the birthday boy. Near us was a couple celebrating an anniversary with rose peddles on the table.  The food and service were as good as it gets! We shared a large crab cake and calamari for appetizers and had swordfish, scallops, & roasted beets for the main dish. All were cooked to perfection and creatively prepared. There is live music (not loud at all) and a relaxing beautiful bar area next to the main dining area separated by a glass wall. This is an excellent place for happy hour or to hang out before or after dinner.  It was a Monday night and there were several tables of businessmen. The restaurant sits below street level and the ambiance is formal with white tablecloths, however it feels modern and you can see the immaculate kitchen behind glass. I don't think they have anything to hide. Our bill with a $43 dollar bottle of wine was $175 before the tip, I expect the average bill is higher. Portions are generous and side dishes are meant to be shared. The prices are justified for such an exceptional restaurant. It's a exceptional addition to Pittsburgh's greatly improving fine dining scene.",

We were placed in a semi private room with a table for four. The live music was wonderful. Live music is hard to find and its volume still allowed for conversation. In a place such as this the absence of butter knives seemed strange. The bread and butter very tasty. The menu is fish centric with perfectly done ahi tuna and a Parmesan sole. The portions are more than adequate and the sides, especially the rice and the asparagus were well executed and not just filler. Our waiter Michael was warm, informative and very professional. Sadly our bottle of white wine did not come with a cooler. Too full we passed on dessert. The prices are high but the quality of food, venue and service justify the price tag. We will return to enjoy the restaurant again.",

    "text": "Well, I know Yelpers love a steakhouse, but this one gets a \"meh\" from me.  Let me be clear for the people that think I am just cheap and don't know a good meal when I see one...   I am fine with paying top dollar for a meal (and you will certainly do that here), but it better be worth it - and this meal wasn't.     Much of what we had was pretty good - the calamari appetizer, crabcakes, seafood trio, a fish entree, and two sides.   Just pretty good though - maybe slightly above average, but certainly not outstanding.  My steak was really where the problem was - this 8 ounce medium rare filet was a dry and under-seasoned travesty.  The color was right, but there wasn't a drop of juice in this steak.  I don't even know how you accomplish that, but they did. It was flavorless with a dry, chalky texture that was really disappointing.  Apparently, you really need to get the extras to dress it up, because it did not stand well on its own.   Three of us got steaks and we all agreed that they were not great.  We ate most of them, but no one finished their meat.     The service was decent, albeit a bit slow.  The server asked if we were trying to make the hockey game, which we were.  We didn't care about being exactly on time, but we did care about being efficient about it.   He had some personality and seemed to be enjoying his job, which was nice to see.  Definitely a level of formality that suited the place.  There was one minor ordering snafu, which was promptly made right.    The decor is a confused mix of styles meant to be opulent, but really it just missed the mark for me.  Our table (one of the round ones with part bench and part chair seating) was comfy, but it was also so large that we had a hard time passing items and hearing conversation.     All in all, we spent $600 for the five of us, with minimal drinking.   We left full, but somehow less than satisfied.  You can easily find a better meal for far less.  And a more interesting one too.",

    "text": "4.5 stars: 4 food | 5 service  Came to Eddie V's for my birthday, and was definitely impressed.  First accommodation I received was a birthday card, along with scattered birthday themed pieces on the table. It really brought a fun theme to the environment and I was excited for what was ahead.  The menu here is perfect. The organization is great, with appetizers, a subdivision between smaller dishes and larger, and dedicated sections for special dishes like oysters and combos. The variety is also well represented in all the dishes---you'll have plenty of fishes and flavors to try out. The drink menu is also absolutely stacked, and you'll find anything from cheap beers and champagnes to standard cocktails and even the most expensive of drinks that go into prices of the thousands.  In terms of the food, I ordered about as much as I could eat in a sitting.   Appetizers I went with colder dishes, oysters and yellowtail sashimi. The oysters were pretty good, but not stellar. I ordered an East coast variety, and they weren't too salty, which was nice, but they also didn't have much texture and wasn't all that savory. In terms of the sashimi, the dish took a very unique twist on traditional Japanese sashimi, which is usually not flavored. The sashimi was instead served with a heavy and salty sauce, and moderately garnished. At first, I thought it was an okay balance, but as I continued eating, the dish was just really salty and really drowned out the flavor of the fish. The dish was still really interesting and the ham-like texture of the yellowtail was interesting.  For the entrees, I ordered a sea bass and a lobster tail + steak combo. The lobster tail and steak were rather disappointing. First, I had a filet steak, and the steak was so loose, and tasted more like a New York strip (maybe even looser); there was no tender texture that filets normally have. Then, the lobster tail was a South African cold water variety, which had me really excited. These lobsters are special because they have larger tails than Maine ones, and also don't have large claws, which apparently make their tail meat super special. However, when I ate my lobster, I found it to be really tough. This might have just been because it's a different variety of lobster, but the meat was just really tough and didn't have the bounce and juicy texture that Maine lobster has. The flavor however, was pretty bold, and I really enjoyed the butter smell.   As for the sea bass, it was an absolutely sublime experience. Even though the bass filet is steamed, it comes out perfectly tender, so much that the individual layers of meat can still be separated apart. The flavor is light, but the sauce at the bottom of the dish helps adds another dimension to amazing meat. The garnishes that come with the dish is also amazing, and I just loved everything about it.   I also ordered a lobster mac as a side, but it wasn't too memorable. Really standard cheese and the lobster flavor didn't really find a spot amidst all the gooey flavor. For desserts, I had the chocolate cake and it was pretty much as much as I'd expect out of a hot chocolate cake. Not too sweet, nothing too bold, and presentation is really normal --- just a round cake in the middle of a plate. I did get happy birthday written on the edges of the plate, which was pretty nice.  For the service, it was just amazing. I was seated slightly late, and they gave me complimentary appetizers. I had a free birthday dessert, and my waiter just explained everything to be so nicely, whether it was something from the salads, to how a wine is crafted, or even how to eat a dish.   I really enjoyed my time at Eddie V's, and although not all the dishes hit the mark, the service is impeccable, the selection of items is amazing, and everything in the restaurant gives you an opportunity to have a fun time.",

It took us a long time to get our apps and the salads came out at the same time as the apps. I also had a lobster bisque. No flavor. The main courses cane out delivered to the wrong people. The steaks were all ordered the same temperature and all came out different.   Items we asked about and were told they had, were in fact, not available. We ordered multiple drinks that took forever to show up. It was terrible but for what I paid, I expect a lot better.",

We arrived at 5:05 PM and was seated immediately. Yes they have a coat check. The place was very clean and very classy. Our waitress, Alex, was very attentive, helpful, and knowledgeable about the menu. Our meal overall was excellent. The Chilean Seabass and the Crabcake were a 10 out of 10. The lobster mashed potatoes was also 10 out of 10. A few fresh oysters were very good but I didn't want to lose my appetite for the main course. The brussels sprouts were a little dry and could have used a little more olive oil. The sauteed spinach could have been cooked a little longer. I highly recommend this place for a classy meal. We will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Eddie V's is a hidden gem! My coworkers and I decided to come here for RW with a last minute reservation. We called the day of and surprisingly got offered seats at the bar which we happily took. This night ended up being particularly cold and snowy so luckily for us, that meant that there were lots of cancellations. We noticed a lot of empty tables when we arrived, and when we asked, they kindly offered us one.   I started off with the lobster bisque which came with a teeny chunk of lobster and a larger round of bread. This way okay. It would have been awesome if the sizes of the proportions flipped around, but I'm sure that would never happen.  For my entree, I got the salmon and I kid you not when I say it was some of the best salmon I've had. The salmon filet was so soft and flaked right apart when I picked it up with my fork. It came accompanied with baby potatoes, corn, tomatoes, and brussel sprouts which were all seasoned just the right amount.   For dessert I got the banana flambe which was lit on fire right in front of me. It came with sliced bananas on top and butter pecan ice cream which was delicious paired with the hot banana cake. Imagine a nice hot and cold combo in your mouth. In the end it was a bit too sweet for me, but still so good.   The service was impeccable. Our waiter was awesome - when we tried to hand him our finished plates, he commented that the only time we needed to pick up a finger is to enjoy our food. Thought that was sweet. The ambiance here was on point too. I absolutely loved the live piano playing towards the back.   Would highly recommend this place for a nice dinner!",

    "text": "My first time here and while it wasn't perfect, the service and food more than made up for it.  Check it...  The Situation: A week prior I made a reservation on Open Table for the wrong date.  Problem is that I didn't realize this until I arrived.  When I checked in at the desk, they asked for my name and said it would be a couple minutes longer because they were a little behind on reservations.  After waiting for about 25 minutes, I went back up to the hostess stand and inquired on how much longer the wait would be.  At that point, another host checked the computer and advised that she didn't see my reservation.  When I checked the confirmation in my email, I realized my error and explained what happened.  The hostess told me not to worry and they would still accommodate us.  Talk about major save.  I truly appreciated them not only for fitting us in but being friendly and professional during the whole thing. Pretty cool.   Ambiance: We were seated by the bar which was kind of loud at one point but died down once more people disbursed and were seated.  The room was beautiful and spacious with a sexy vibe.  It was a Friday night and there was live music and we sang along to songs like Marvin Gaye's, \"What's going on\". We sat at a high top and had a good view of the bar, TVs and the musicians.   Food:  The lobster bisque was ok.  I have had better but they do make up for it with the huge chunk of claw meat in the middle of the bowl. The crouton or cracker in the middle taste like a homemade ritz cracker, very buttery.   Filet mignon was butter soft and cooked perfectly but did lack a bit of seasoning.  The sauce did help to add additional flavor however and when eaten together were perfect. The accompanying asparagus were ho hum ok.  I mean they were very tiny, some of the tips charred and bitter.  Not a big deal.  The grilled shrimp on top were huge and cooked to perfection. I mean those suckers bursts in my mouth and were so juicy and flavorful.  Yum!  Crab stuffed shrimp were good and the crab mixture had very little, if any, filler.  Again, shrimp cooked perfectly.  The side of au gratin potatoes were very rich and delicately seasoned with garlic and cheese, browned perfectly.  The bananas foster butter cake...there's no words.  The fun is in the added visual of the flambe when it's brought to the table.  My first bite was full of rum and I could've sworn there was a bunch of alcohol left.  Lol  Think rum cake, butter, bananas and caramel with a side of butter pecan ice cream and real whipped cream.  That thing was something dreams are made of.  I mean damn.   Lastly, is this place expensive? Hecks yeah, but it's not an everyday type of place.  This place is special, some place you go to celebrate, even if you're just celebrating that it's the weekend :)",

Eddie V's is located in the Union Trust Building in the area that once housed Larrimor's men's clothing.  Although we dressed for the occasion I noticed that most people were dressed business casual.  We had an outstanding waiter named Glenn who catered to all our needs and made sure everything was spot on. Our table was adorned with two roses and there was an anniversary card from the restaurant! How thoughtful of them! We decided to skip the appetizers and start with salads. Before they were brought out we were each given a glass of champagne to celebrate our special day on the house!   I ordered the goat cheese salad with mushrooms and my husband had the Caesar salad. Both salads were delicious!! We had 3 slices of bread with butter on our table. The bread was fresh and good. For our main course I had the stuffed shrimp with crab-meat and my husband had George's bank scallops which was adorned with citrus fruit, almonds, and brown butter. We were seated right by the kitchen so we could watch the chefs prepare the meal. We learned that one executive chefs from McCormick and Schmick had come over here.  Our waiter suggested that we split a vegetable side so we agreed to that and ordered brussel sprouts with bacon and shallots. Since we were one of the first to arrive we got our food fairly quickly. Everything was delicious and believe me we were so full from dinner that we really didn't want to order dessert! I do want to note that if you are not a fish lover Eddie V's also offers all kinds of steaks and yes, there is an entree with tofu as your main course.  So we finally decided to go for dessert. I ordered the hot blackberry cobbler and my husband had the mango sorbet. My cobbler was so big and warm that I had to devour the ice cream before it all melted! Still it was very enjoyable. My husband's sorbet came with two chocolate cookies. When our waiter brought out our checks he told us that our desserts were also on the house. After 6 we began to hear live jazz music from the next room. We felt right at home here.  We knew this new restaurant was pricey but we came prepared for it since this was our special day. They do offer valet parking after 6 pm for $8.00. Otherwise, you can park in one of the downtown garages. Eddie V's is a welcome addition to our neighborhood and would highly recommend it if you want to celebrate something or have a night on the town.",

However, after waiting one hour we weren't seated. Worse part, several families, who also had reservations, and celebrating their children's graduation that evening  from The University of Pittsburg were told the same thing and waited around for a very long time before walking out. Several families walked out and some mothers were in tears. Eddie Vs ruined what should of been a memorable event in so many lives that evening.   It was clear that the restaurant also didn't have enough staff to accommodate the customers. Tables that should of been cleaned and turned over quickly sat unattended for a long time. It looks like the restaurant overbooked. A total mess. Suggest Capital Grill down the street.",

I made a reservation for a date night, and they went the extra mile by sprinkling rose petals on the table. The dim lighting and live band feature created a swanky and classy vibe to the restaurant which I loved.   Service was phenomenal. Everyone from our hostess to our waitresses were so friendly, helpful, and efficient. They have the dream team working here, that's for sure.   Now on to the most important part - the food! Though they're known for their steaks and seafood, this vegetarian opted for the Miso Marinated Tofu entree which was absolutely amazing! the dish is two blocks of tofu and vegetables in a miso sauce over a bed of rice. It's very light yet filling - definitely recommend! I also ordered a small side of the roasted beets which was enjoyable but nothing extraordinary. The small side dishes are meant to be shared between 2 people - clearly this did not apply for me. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate cake a la mode for dessert which was surprisingly disappointing. The cake was too under baked for my liking. If you enjoy raw cake batter, this might be for you, but I would pass otherwise. Luckily, they have plenty of other dessert options available which I may have to return to taste test.  Definitely do not miss out on Eddie V's! Highly recommend for any special occasion because dessert is on the house if you note it in your reservation.",

From the time we walked in the door until the time we left we were made to feel so special and so welcomed by everyone on the staff up to the management. And that was only the icing on the cake. This place is truly a five-star restaurant. We were pretty hungry and over ordered. We started out with the seafood tower which included a 1 pound Maine lobster several pump delicious shrimp about a half a dozen oysters lump crab and several dipping sauces. Following that my wife had a bowl of lobster bisqueAnd I had the Apple and yellow beet salad which was absolutely delicious.  For our main course I had the ribeye steak and my wife had the fillet and crab cake with the crab fried rice on the side to share. By the time it got there we were already full but pretty decent dent in it which finishing about half and leaving half to take home to enjoy for lunch tomorrow. Our waiter Thomas was absolutely fantastic. If you go be sure to ask for him and he will take great care of you. This is absolutely a Destiination restaurant for special occasions because it is not inexpensive but is it is worth every penny that you will spend. This is one of my new favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. I can't recommend it highly enough. Go there for a special occasion or just to spoil yourself, but go!",

All delicious and very fresh.  I ordered the scallops for dinner and they were probably one of the best scallops I've had in a long time. Just the right flakiness and the dressing complimented the seafood very Well. We ordered several sides... lobster mash potatoes and truffle Mac n cheese were my favorites. Service was on point and the dinning room was quite elegant inside. Great for dates and groups.",

A birthday was mentioned in the reservation and they did a great job celebrating it. We had the best seat in the house. The table was decorated with confetti and i had a hand written birthday card.  We enjoyed 2 delicious glasses of wine.  For dinner i enjoyed the swordfish steak. It was topped with a great mix of crab meat & avocado. I ordered a side of their brussel sprouts. Delicious and buttery. Also included bacon pieces.  My husband ordered the 2 tier shellfish. It is intended for a shared option but he ordered it as his main meal. It had 2 lobster tails, oysters (east & west coast) , delicious jumbo shrimp and 4 different sauces and crab meat. It was served looking awesome (see picture)  My server bought my dessert. I ordered the well talked about bananas foster dessert. It had happy birthday written on it in chocolate. The waiter lit the 151 rum at the table  to caramelize the bananas perfectly. The dessert was beyond phenomenal... Literally the most melt in your mouth, amazing dessert.  They made me feel like a queen on my birthday. We had an amazing time. Server was beyond kind. He gave us his business card so that he can serve us another time.  Valet is $8 and well worth it.  Treat yourself. This was a great experience",

The space is beautiful, the staff were all super helpful, and the live music for a full house on a Tuesday evening was a nice touch. This is the place to go to celebrate an engagement, a promotion, or a nice fat tax refund. Try the champagne sauce with their oysters on the half shell. The swordfish had a beautiful presentation. The vegetable sides are large enough for 2-4 people, and even the side salads can be shared by 2 people. We were full after eating our meal but plan on coming back one night just to feel special and try dessert.",

But this place with the service and environment blew me away.  The interior is so nice, its in a renovated space in the Union Trust building. They had nice jazz band playing.  For apps we have the Calamari, Lobster Tacos, and Crab cake. The lobster tacos were my favorite, you get two tacos filled with lobster. The Calamari was crispy and was a little spicy was so good. The Crab Cake (you only get one but enough to share) was all crab and barely cake, which is how you would want them. I also had the Lobster bisque, it was ok, I would go with the Crab and Corn chowder for sure next time.  Dinner, I had the Lobster and Filet. Filet was cooked perfectly and I had to get the blue cheese fondue for my steak. That was a really good decision. The lobster was cooked to perfection.  For the sides, we went with Brussels sprouts, Corn, Lobster Mash Potatoes, and Truffle Mac Cheese. The Mac and Cheese was not as good as we thought, but the other sides made up for it.  I would suggest the lobster mash potatoes, chucks of lobster and cheesy potatoes, what could go wrong.   I would differently recommend this place, good for a nice dinner.",

    "text": "It's rare I do this, but I must. Eddie V's atmosphere is jovial and pleasant. Accommodating and cheerful. This was the feeling I got while eating there. But, the prices are ridiculous for the quality of food you are being served. Being the restaurant is downtown Pittsburgh I understand the rent must be high. Me and my buddy's got the shellfish tower. The shrimp were dry, no drawn butter for the lobster. The crab meat was dry as well. I then took a chance on the $89 South African lobster tails. They tasted no different than the Maine lobster tails. Just a tiny bit sweeter. But we're double the price. I asked for a salad and lobster bisque. I asked they arrive separately before the main course. They arrived at the same time and the serving waiting poured the soup before I could stop him. So I had both soup and salad sitting before me, which made me rush to eat the salad before the soup got cold. The desert of chocolate cake was Devine, but the vanilla bean ice cream was icy, not creamy (you know what I mean?). And finally I accidentally left my credit card at the restaurant after our meal. When I returned to pick it up the very next day,  the staff informed me that there was no credit card there. I must have made a mistake they said. I then asked, a couple of times and was finally given to the manager that was on duty. I asked to check with the waiter that had waited our table. They informed me he was not working that day. Now, I was only stopping by the restaurant to get my card. It was a very busy day for me. I didn't have a lot of time and was returning to Los Angeles the next morning and was going to really need my Amex. I then asked them to personally call him. They were not keen on that idea. I didn't really care about how  keen they were on my idea. I insisted. Finally they called him.  And guess what. The waiter had pocketed my amex card and taken it home with him. He had forgotten to give the card to his manager or lost and found or whatever they do with credit cards that are mistakenly left behind. Now, once all was clear they asked if I wanted any water, a drink, to sit at the bar, some dinner. I informed them that I had a very busy day and no time for that. They told me it would be an8-10 minute wait. 20 minutes later the waiter arrived and handed me my card. He too apologized. Now, I thought that they would give me discounts for dinner at another time. Or coupons or something besides having me eat dinner right then and there. They did not. But they did smile and apologize for my inconvenience. When you are a 5 star restaurant you take the hit for something that really went wrong for a customer. Now there are other Eddie V's around the country. I often travel to Detroit for business. I have friends in Dallas and find myself in Boston every 2 or 3 years for business, months at a time. What do you think people?  Am I a cry baby, or do you expect a little more from a supposedly top notched, high caliber restaurant?  I end with this, the food was mediocre at best. Our waiter overall was good, the Malbec was balanced and tasty. I just expected more I guess.",

Anyway, the wait was worth it because the meal and service were excellent.  Our server ended up bringing us complimentary champagne as well as desert for the special occasion we were celebrating and was frequently checking on us in between every other phase of the experience.  One of the specials this evening was a one pound (huge) South African lobster tail.  I wanted that, my wife wanted filet, both were more than either of us could eat, we each wanted surf & turf, so the server suggested we get one of each and he'd split them table side even though they're prepared as individual entrees.  That's what he did and the result was perfect; half a filet and a huge 1/2 pound of lobster, and of course lots left over for the next day.  The Patron perfect margarita was excellent; great taste, plenty of booze to meet the price point, so I was happy.",

Our waiter asked if we had any time constraints and said he'd make sure our check was on the table at a specified time when I said we were attending a show. He was attentive to us but not overly bothersome considering the restaurant was not busy while we were there. He also cracked a few jokes and was very personable.   The craft cocktails we ordered came quickly and were very good. We both ordered filet mignon and they were cooked perfectly medium rare. The au gratin potatoes were also delicious, as was the Godiva chocolate cake we had for dessert. There were some seafood items I would love to try on their menu, so I hope to come back in the future.   Eddie V's is certainly in the higher price range, but the service and food was beyond worth it.",

However tonight was horrible service!  we ordered our food and we order appetizers salad and the main course they brought two of the three meals all together at one time except for break it out the side dishes about my food out left and my two children were halfway done eating their food things happen so I really didn't mind I had to get up and go to the bar and asked for steak knife I had it at another waiter to refill my drink I got my food with the others were about done eating their food and my drink was sitting at the bar so long....when I got it it was water down I did not even drink it. very very very   manager came over she did not clear any plates on the table she just put the food down and walked away.  Will I go back... yes .... maybe tonight was just a bad night. It happens but for $250 it really should be a near perfect night. But I will go back because they have one of the best bands on Monday night.",

    "text": "No stars.  None. This place was awful and just a rip off. We suffered it because of our friends but will never do that again.   Details: 1. I was asked if I wanted to wait for my party or be taken to our table. I said I'd like to sit at our table. After I had waited my turn in line, they sat 3-4 tables who walked in after me while I just stood there...waiting for what?  2. After ordering, every drink order, appetizers, then main course, we were first brought someone else's. They got it wrong each time, then we had to wait a very long for our correct order. We were headed to the theater so... 3. Oysters were fabulous. Ok so I'll give a star for that. 4. My entree. Scallops. 5 over-done, over-salty, tiny scallops cost $37!!! Literally an appetizer size portion cost $37!!! And no sides, just 5 minuscule scallops. Did I say they were over salted? 5. My husband had a tiny steamed and over salted, soaking in soy sauce (not miso as the menu said) piece of sea bass.   The service sucked. The food was sub-par and far to expensive. I feel like a total sucker for not walking out the moment they sat all those people before me. What we do for friends.",

    "text": "This is a FIVE star restaurant--anything posted to the contrary is just wrong (or the hater has no idea how to order a decent meal).  Excellent steaks, fresh high quality seafood and inspired combinations.  Bravo, Eddie V's!  I started with the Tartare of Pacific Tuna (curry and sesame oils, avocado, mango and citrus), followed by a second course of Crab and Corn Chowder (smoked bacon, potatoes and sweet corn).  In all honesty, if there were a power outage or other catastrophe that ceased all kitchen function at that point, I would have left completely satisfied with my meal.  The tuna was superb, and the citrus/mango perfectly complimented the ample-sized fish stack.  The Chowder was also noteworthy--a hearty, flavorful effort to be savored.  But my main course was simply spectacular.  I had the 22oz USDA Prime Bone-In Ribeye, paired with the Brussels sprouts, bacon and shallots.  The steak was melt-in-your-mouth tender and exquisitely flavored, and the sprouts were equally delicious.  I even sampled a bit of my dining companion's crab fried rice, which was a unique and welcome departure from the go-to baked potato.  I really don't think you could miss ordering off of the expansive Eddie V's menu.  The meal left me with just one disappointment--why are you not located in Utah?!?!  Thanks for a terrific meal, Eddie V's!",

I told him we didn't have to go somewhere so fancy, but he insisted and I am so glad he did!  We just got home from an all-around amazing dining experience.  We had reservations at 7 and were promptly seated.  We both started with a cocktail - mine was the pomegranate mule and he had the Gatsby sour.  Our awesome waiter brought both out along with some tasty, warm bread.  Ryan decided on the crabcake to start and it was the perfect size to share and hold us over. It was the best crabcake I have ever had - fresh, perfectly seasoned crab with hardly any filler and fresh lemon squeezed over it.  Really to die for.  I had the chilean sea bass and my boyfriend had the crusted sole.  We shared the crab fried rice accompaniment per a friend's recommendation and everything was so flavorful and just perfect.  The atmosphere is upscale and dimly lit - very romantic and fancy. I am so happy we stopped in for such a fantastic meal.  PS..hi ry",

My daughter and I shared an order of the lobster tacos which had nice sized chunks of sweet lobster. I selected the crab and corn chowder which was the weakest item of the evening. Very little crab or corn flavor-bacon overpowered the flavor. My swordfish was juicy and flavorful and served with grilled tender asparagus. The bananas foster cake was flamed tableside and was a delightfully rich, buttery cake served with a scoop of butter pecan ice cream. Perfect ending to a great meal. The service was professional and attentive.",

I stated in the reservation that it was for her birthday and the restaurant went out of their way to make sure she felt special. The table was decorated with happy birthday greetings along with a nice card! They also gave us complimentary dessert and Prosecco for our celebration.   The ambiance of the restaurant is great with lovely music playing in the lounge. The waitstaff was very attentive and knowledgeable. We ordered tuna tartare to start and share. For our mains she had the Chilean sea bass and I had a bone in strip steak. Both were excellent. We also enjoyed an order of crab friend rice that was tasty.

    "text": "Very nice place but we had our challenges.  Our waiter Thomas did an excellent job! He was well trained and very personable. As you read in, you'll realize the importance of that fact.   We got there st 5:30 on April 16, the Pens playoff game started at 7:30 and we had to be out of there by 7:00 sharp. The first thing Thomas did was review our time line to get us out of there on time.  Unfortunately, that didn't happen and we ended up being very rushed to eat our main course, and had to skip the most important part of every meal; desert!!!!!  Not his fault, he did what he could.   The appetizers were very good, calamari, lobster tacos, and shrimp cocktail.  All were very tasty and they were served pretty quickly.  So far, so good.   The second course was a Caesar Salad, generous portion, and the big chunks of grated cheeses were really exceptional.   My main course was an 8 ounce filet special with a crab cake, both were amazing, but the steak needed another couple minutes in the grill. While waiting for our main course, Thomas warned us that the kitchen was struggling to keep up. We all checked our watches, and we're getting concerned. (Remember that the only goal of the night that night for the Pens was less than a minute into the game). The Manager came over to grovel and assure us they were doing all they could.  The truffle Mac and cheese was heavenly, the au gratin potatoes were surprisingly huge and also very good. Unfortunately, we really had to chow down in a hurry to get out of there in time.   When I asked about desert, Thomas didn't even respond because the guy paying the bill wanted wanted to go! Best part, the Manager came back over and comped (fancy for free) all of our main course meals!  That's 4 x $50 on average. Pretty happy ending. I will come back and try the place again when time isn't an issue.",

We weren't seated for our 7:30 reservations until 7:50 and the gaggle of checkin chicks clearly didn't give a damn. They were polite, cute, and respectful, but they were obviously trained to respond with platitudes, not information. Bad start. Our dinners were fine but not notable. We split the caprese salad and had halibut and stuffed shrimp entrees. We also shared the au gratin potatoes. It was too late for desert. The dining room is attractive and the live jazz is enjoyable and very unusual. The prices require perfection which wasn't delivered last night. We will think hard about returning.",

I have never seen anything like it elsewhere. As someone who doesn't like seafood, this is a place I don't get too excited about visiting but this is often a top pick of our friends. Most seafood places will always have a token chicken dish on the menu and/or a steak option. I decided to order the gnocchi on this trip and wasn't really impressed but also wasn't surprised that it wasn't great. Everyone else loved their food and the waiter was fabulous. We were celebrating a birthday and the desert was beautiful. The lounge is a great place to spend an evening listening to the live music that they often have for entertainment. We will likely go back and I will order that steak next time.",

We tend to go here for restaurant week starts their steaks alone are $45 apiece and with the restaurant week deal you get a steak and appetizer and a dessert for $35. Service is always impeccable, our server Olivia was courteous and attentive and there was never a time when I was wondering where she was because I needed something. we enjoyed a lovely crab and corn chowder for an appetizer. My husband upgraded his entree to this Chilean sea bass with miso broth it was incredible. I had the 8 ounce filet cooked medium rare with a dollop of truffle mashed potatoes, the steak was cooked perfectly and the truffle mash potatoes were a perfect mini accompaniment. We ordered the crab Fried rice as our side dish and it was beyond amazing I could eat that as a meal every day of my life and be happy. For dessert my husband had a mango sorbet with a chocolate cookie and I had a decaf coffee and the bananas Foster flambe butter cake. All in all a great evening at Eddie V's and we will be back.",

Atmosphere is on the fancier side which was perfect before we saw a snow at the Benedum. If you love Jazz music I recommend coming when the bands start and sitting in or very close to the bar. I also recommend reservations as I'm not sure what you'll get just walking in.   Food served ala carte. Two appetizers and two sides in addition to our entrees served our party of four perfectly. My swordfish topped with cilantro, avocado and grapefruit was just amazing!   Worth every dollar we spent and I can't wait to come back! Only wish I'd saved room for dessert!",

    "text": "I know Eddie V's is a chain - but this place is a must-go. The food is superb, consistent and the service is great. They always have live music by the bar which makes for a lively atmosphere in a restaurant with great food (hard to find). They have a mix of steak and seafood so something for everyone.  On this visit we started with the calamari, ahi sashimi and burrata salad. The ahi was tasty but a little small, the calamari was good and enormous. The burrata was very small and not good for sharing but was definitely plenty with the other appetizers.  Dinner was followed with the Chilean sea bass - this was delicious, tender and cooked to perfection. We had the truffle Mac and cheese as an app along with the corn and asparagus. Get the truffle Mac - you won't regret this.  Finally for dessert we tried the creme brulee, butter cake and hot molten chocolate cake. The banana foster butter cake was out of this world. STOP right now and order the butter cake, don't question it! Thank me later. Wow!  Brayden gave us fantastic and professional service. We will be back. Thank you!",

    "text": "In town for a wedding and we selected Eddie V's for dinner based on such Rave Yelp reviews and we are Pearl Jam fans (no connection, I know). The bar was comfortable, and a jazz quartet was playing close by. The bartender made Manhattans with Angel's Envy bourbon...delicious...   So we ordered almost everything... Kung Pao Calamari (zesty flavors and lots of crunch), Warm Goatcheese Salad (one of kind experience of flavors), Seabass in a light soy broth (Heavenly) and Parmesan Baked Sole (paled in comparison to the Seabass but it was a nice dish). Lobster and cheese mashpotatos were a bit over tbe top for us but its not like it isnt IIas advertised. No room for dessert so we split a Bananas Foster and practically licked our plates. The location is the first floor of an old building so makes sure you walk in and take a look aroubd the spectacular lobby.  The service might seem slow if you're in a hurry, but it felt to us like the pace was at ease on purpose, as a delicious meal should never be rushed. Why 4 stars? I would give 4.5 if possible, but it was not habds down perfect which is a 5 star review.",

They don't call it prime seafood for no reason, because that's exactly what it is.  My date was celebrating her birthday on a busy Friday evening and the experience was everything that we could've asked for and then some. She was greeted with a happy birthday note and even got her choice of a complimentary dessert. Fun and festive decorations were placed on our table which I should mention was the best seat on the house in our opinion.  For the second time I ordered the Norwegian salmon which is prepared crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The best part of it all has to be the bananas foster which they flambe tableside. Perfection!",

    "text": "My last 2 visits to an Eddie V's have not been great.  Starting to notice that the seafood versions vs the steakhouse versions are different. The steakhouse versions are way better.   We ordered oysters, steaks, bottles of vino, desserts and port.  Let's start by saying service was molasses in. January. Took 20 some Mins to get our first bottle of wine and took almost 40 to get our oysters. We arrive at 7:30 and didn't finish until 11pm.....  Oysters - Blue point. Good ones. Had to ask for cocktail forks, crackers and hot sauce. Should've been there already  Steaks - we wanted bone in filets and ordered, only to have server come back and say they don't have them. Most of us ordered 12oz filets and 2 in our party ordered fish and small filet. They messed up the delivery and gave wrong steaks to wrong people. One of them was rare vs medium rare which I was happy to snag from one of the crew but they should nail the cook temp here.   When we first ordered our meal I ordered a Pinot for our starter and then asked for a duckhorn merlot with our meal. The food showed up and then the wine followed after.....  The au gratin potatoes weren't cooked enough, the mac n cheese was way too chewy and the winner was the Brussels.   We tried a chocolate cake and had a couple of kiddie sundaes which were best of the night and a round of 10 year tawny's. Dessert was best course.   Overall for the money and expectation - definitely didn't meet the value prop I'm used to from Eddie V's. The Austin and San Antonio locations still rank tops and can't wait to go back to one of those to reset my Eddie clock",

We had the lobster bisque which was tasty, but as other reviews have noted was a bit light on lobster. The Point Judith Calamari was excellent. The roasted cashews were unexpected, but delicious! For the entree he ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and I ordered the George's Bank Scallops. Both entrees were delicious and we thoroughly enjoyed our meals, as well as the shared side dishes--the Crab Fried Rice and the Butter Poached Lobster Mashed Potatoes. For dessert we shared the Hot Chocolate Godiva Cake which was served with vanilla ice cream. I'm not a huge fan of chocolate cake, but it just just the right amount of richness. Our server brought us complimentary glasses of champagne as well! We're fans and will be back in the future for more special occasions!",

We ordered two appetizers, a salad, steaks, and a side dish.  The oysters were placed on the table without explanation of the accompanying sauces.  The salad was good, tomatoes were fresh.  The lobster mashed potatoes had so much butter that it was pooling around the edges of the bowl.  One steak was overcooked, came out medium well instead of medium rare.  The server took it back and the manager quickly came over to apologize and offered to even cook both steaks again so we could eat together.  We felt it was handled appropriately and would easily have returned for future meals after this.  However, the steak never came out.  I asked the server after a long while to see if it may be ready.  She came back from the kitchen frazzled and said, \"it will be out but I don't have a time to give you.\"  Then a kitchen manager brought a piece of meat, set it down, did not wait for me to cut it open and quickly left. It was very fatty and appeared to be NOT the cut of meat (filet) that I had ordered.  It was over cooked, again.  The server happened to walk over and said, \"yes, I thought that it didn't look right.\"  I left without eating dinner.  She brought the check over and said, \"I'm sure you guys don't want dessert, so I brought the check.\"  The manager never followed up to see if I had received the new steak.  The issues could've easily been solved had someone not dropped the ball and given up on following through.  They did credit the check for two steaks, but really that was not the issue.  Unfortunately, this restaurant was a big let down.",

    "text": "Well we went for restaurant week and in my opinion treated just as such. Seated 30+mins late with a reservation, once seated it took so long to get a glass of water I was tempted to get a pitcher and pour it myself. Was looking forward to the filet medallions or 8 oz filet but both were sold out along with the 12oz filet. We ordered a dozen oysters and one option on the menu was sold out but the alternative was delicious. My husband ordered the Crispy Salt and Pepper Shrimp which were good but the sauce tasted very asian generic and kinda ruined the delicious scrimp. For our main course we had the Parmesan Sole and the Jumbo Gulf Shrimp both were very tasty. I ordered the shrimp since all of the filets were not and option and most of the seafood had a sweet or asian influence. For dessert once again they were out of what we were looking forward to, \"Bananas Foster\" Butter Cake with butter pecan ice cream but the waiter did say we could choose any dessert in its place which was very nice. My husband ordered the Hot Apple Cobbler which was more like a pie with burn crust and I got the Hot Chocolate Godiva Cake that to me was nothing special. We also had a glass of port with dinner that arrived in a very sticky glass. The desserts took a long time to come out and our waiter did comp the port as an apology for how long the desserts took, which was very nice of him. When we got our coats from the coat check the girl asked us how everything was an I was honest and said we were a bit disappointed as two things we came for were not available. A gentleman who works here gave my husband a card for a complimentary Bananas Foster Butter Cake which was a really nice gesture. All in all I think we should have not come during Restaurant Week because they were too overwhelmed and it ruined our first and probably last visit here. I appropriated the comps they gave us but at the end of the day if I am spending $200+ on a dinner I want to be happy when I leave. I understand the majority of the tables may have been spending more than us but I work hard and when we treat ourselves I want it to be a good experience and feel worth it rather than let down.  The food & service are good but during a busy time you may be underwhelmed.",

    "text": "We met up with some family in Pittsburgh for the night and they chose Eddie V's for us and I'm glad they did. My wife and I love steakhouses in particular steak houses in Las Vegas.  I have to say without a doubt the steak at Eddie V's was one of the best I've had outside of Las Vegas. We also happened to be in Pittsburgh for restaurant week. We started the night with happy hour drinks before dinner. They had a fun drink/app menu at the bar. They had a special menu for this week that included a starter, main and a dessert for $35.99 which is a steal at any steakhouse. My wife and i both started with a salad that was okay but if we had to do it again i think we would both get the chowder or lobster bisque. For our mains I chose to upgrade my steak to a 22 oz bone in porterhouse with a side of asparagus. My wife chose the 8 oz filet and and asparagus as well. Her steak was also perfect. For dessert we decided to get two different things and split them. I had the berry sorbet and my wife the pannacotta. They were both very good and we were both couldn't eat another bite. I should also mention we had 3 bottles of wine between 5 of us (one family member was pregnant). The wine was provided by one family member who provided the wine. They charge a corkage fee which was was minimal for the quality of wine. Their wine list was very extensive.",

My fiance and I are out constantly downtown and travel so we do have high expectations of venues like this and steakhouses in general and this place has become our go to.

He also brought us oysters cause he heard my fiance saying she liked them and I had never really had them. The oysters (which I thought I'd hate) turned out being something I wanna come back here for and have more of. Then for dinner my fiance had the ahi tuna which literally melted in your mouth and I had the NY strip with the peppercorn sauce.  Definitely one of the best steaks I've had in pittsburgh. Finally we finished it off with some port and a creme brulee. Definitely will be coming back and telling others.",

I find it helpful on a weekend to make reservations however on a Thursday evening and what appeared plenty of dinning tables available.  I feel like the reaction should be met with, \"not a problem, we are so glad to have you join us,\" but in reality when I said no, I'm sorry I did not make reservations that he seemed annoyed and almost disgusted instead of being accommodating. That said, although I wanted to walk out I did not want my friend to not have a great night.  I immediately said, we would go to the bar.  It was great despite the initial lack of welcome.  They had a great jazz style band playing and we had a very nice table that initially was off to a slow start with our service but once I asked the bar tender if there was a possibility of being waited on, all was good.  The food, Calamari, Jumbo Shrimp, Lobster mashed, Fried Rice, Kettle Martinis, were all excellent.  Keep in mind, the food and atmosphere are high end in feel and when considering most high end markets like, NYC, LA, SF, one expects to pay a premium and all items are a la carte.  If your looking a cheap night out this would not be it but if your looking for a higher end experience this would hit the mark as dinner was around the 220.00 for two and well worth the money IMHO.  I'd say the staff needs to also realize most that walk in the door can easily afford it or rest assured they'd go elsewhere. To that end, one never knows what someone can and cannot afford so treat all guests as you'd want to be treated.",

A birthday dinner for the love of my life with our 2 adult kids made for a great experience. Larry, our server, was a pleasure to deal with and went out of his way to provide complementary champagne as a celebratory pre-meal drink. The Mavericks were excellent both in flavor and in presentation. Be prepared as this restaurant is not inexpensive. Certainly not for an everyday meal. Our celebration was, however, worth it.  Just a tip that valet does not begin prior to 6 pm. Something the restaurant did not tell me when reserving for 545, so I had to park myself and drop my party at the front door. A little odd.",

This time, the staff knocked my expensive fur coat on the floor and I had to pick it up, and my filet mignon that was supposed to be medium was rare. A manager apologized to another person at my table, but he did not even look at me! I just ate the exterior of the red steak rather than wait for a new one. A few of the side vegetables were complimentary, probably because of my friend's messed-up order and the fact that vegetables cost less than the filet mignon.",

Kristina was extremely professional and sincere. The seafood tower was exquisite and everyone at the table enjoyed it. We had swordfish and halibut and the food was exquisite. If you have time to go to Eddie V's I think you should ask for Kristina and enjoy the evening!",

Great ambiance with live music and a attractive wine area. Seating was very comfortable. The AC was on a little high for Memorial Day weekend but we were able to adjust after awhile.   Our wait staff was great. Shared his favorites and gave us time to order when asked, kept the table clean and arranged for payment in a different area (we always fight for the bill at any restaurant).   All the steaks ( NY strip, filet mignon and bone in sirloin) were perfectly cooked. The sea bass was outstanding. The appetizers of the calamari and blue point oysters were enjoyable as well. The Godiva chocolate and bananas foster was a perfect end to the evening.   Very family oriented and private (they kept some predator hockey players in a special area). We would definitely recommend this place and go again.",

We started the evening at the bar where I had the hope diamond martini. The ice cube melted in front of you that made the martini a beautiful purple color. It was delicious. We also had some apps of raw oysters, eddies Rockefeller, and filet sliders. All to die for! The bartender was very knowledgeable on the oysters and we had a great time with him. When we decided to sit down for dinner we got to the table and it was decorated for my boyfriends birthday with confetti on the table and their was a personalized card from the Eddie V's team. It was a nice personal touch. I had the lobster bisque to start which was an amazing tableside presentation...the bowl came out with a chock full of lobster meat in the bowl and the sever came over and poured the bisque from a hot tea kettle right in front of me!  Awesome presentation with an ever better taste! For dinner my boyfriend had the ahi tuna and I had the Parmesan sole. His tuna was a perfect rare color and flavorful with the surrounding vegetables and sauce with it. My Parmesan sole was so tasty! A nice light fish with a perfect Parmesan crust on it! The sauce was a lemon butter that was so flavorful accompanied by a tomatoes salad! Very yummy  and a perfect portion. We also got Brussels sprouts  and lobster mashed potatoes. The Brussels sprouts were tossed in a nice sauce and bacon (you can never go wrong with bacon!) the lobster mashed were so good as well! Loaded with lobster meat and so hot. Melted right in your mouth. For dessert, the sever brought over the bananas foster butter cake. They came over and flambeed it tableside and it was written happy birthday in chocolate sauce on the plate. (As seen in the picture) It was complimentary and very much appreciated for their  thoughtfulness. We also got the butterscotch panna cotta which was tasty as well! We will never forget this amazing experience. Our bartender was fun to our professional and knowledgeable waiter as well. They made us feel welcome, and was such a nice treat that we will never forget. We were visiting friends in Pittsburgh and made sure we went here and so glad we did. We live in reading, pa now and sad that there is not a closer Eddie v's to us. But to find out there is one coming soon! We have our reservations set for the king of Prussia location on November 2nd which happens to be my birthday! What better way to celebrate my birthday with you guys at Eddie v's! I cannot not wait and thank you Pittsburgh team for the amazing meal and experience!",

I tried swordfish steak for the first time it was very good, topped with avocado crab and chili. The fried oyster appetizer was my favorite I could have devoured so many of those. And the bananas foster desert is quite the delicious experience. Great spot for a classy date night!",

The one thing that bothered us all is the gap between appetizers/salads and the main entree...way too long (30+ minutes).  As for the food...Lobster bisque was very good.  Sea Bass in light soy sauce with ginger and spinach was very good.  Others in our group had the scallops and all said they were not seared off enough...broccolini was just OK was kind of bland, brussel sprouts were too hard and not cooked enough, but the lobster mashed potatoes were excellent.  All in all somewhat disappointed considering the cost...they need to up there game if they want to charge those prices.  Lastly, waited 20 minutes for car at valet.",

A little over the top he gave us a chuckle but was very helpful with recommendations.    My only complaint is the live jazz music was entirely too loud.  Needs to be toned down a bit more like background music it's a nice touch but I'm not there for a concert.  Could not have a conversation in the bar.  If you want to have a nice meal & conversation I recommend making reservations on the dining room side.  I'm sure you would still hear the music but be able to hear each other as well.  I don't enjoy shouting and saying \"what?\"every other word.  Food was very good but the only thing I can say really stood out was my drink.  I think it was called \"Hope Diamond\".  On menu under \"24 Carat\" drink. Delicious & highly recommended!",
