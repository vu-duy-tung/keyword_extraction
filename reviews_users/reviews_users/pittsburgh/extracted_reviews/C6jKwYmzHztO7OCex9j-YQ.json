    "text": "I've pretty much been exclusively ordering delivery pizza from this place for the last two and a half years. I like them because their pizza is pretty no-nonsense and it is cheap. Where else can you get an eight slice premium pie for under $18? My favorite is the Mia special pizza as it has plenty of meat and veggies. The dough isn't as crispy as I would like, but overall, the pizza is delicious. As for non-pizza fare, the house rolls with spinach and feta are amazing. I usually get that or wings with my order. The wings are ok--kind of expensive but the quality is standard, if not a little dry. I live right around the block from Mineo's / Aiello's / Napoli's, but I keep coming back to this place because it's affordable and I'm too lazy for pick up. I wouldn't recommend the hoagies, though. I had a couple and they weren't bursting with flavor & had too much bread going on.",

This business is a sham. PLEASE AVOID if you don't want to ruin you precious moments of celebration.  Extremely extremely dissatisfied and annoyed that we chose this outlet.",

I wanted something that actually wasn't on the menu, an eggplant Parm grinder. Let me just say, they have a chicken Parm on the menu. When I ordered on the phone I SPECIFICALLY stated that I wanted something that wasn't on the menu, eggplant Parm. Oh, and also they DO offer an eggplant Parm dinner, so my request wasn't a huge stretch. The woman taking the order said no problem! After the food was delivered and the delivery guy took off I realized that I got a real funky sandwich. Eggplant with melted mozzarella, sliced mushrooms, red onions, and FETA! Wtf? I'm so tired of poor service and inadequacy. I tried to rip it apart and salvage the eggplant and mozzarella, but without any tomato sauce it was bland and dry. We travel to Pittsburgh quite a bit, but I'll learn to be more picky if Zarra's is closed in the future. Blah!",

Delivery was estimated to take 45 minutes to an hour. The pizzas were delivered almost exactly an hour after we placed the order. Food was hot, sodas were cold. The pizza was not life changing, but I didn't expect it to be. It was tasty though. My husband ordered a small Mediterranean pizza. I ordered a small half cheese, half veggie. Pizzas were a little bigger than expected, so we have leftovers. Leftovers are always a plus. Nice meal for a lazy Sunday night.",

The front desk gave us several menus and we chose Mia's.  I was sorry to see so many bad reviews but I can safely say we were very happy with our choices.  We come from suburban Philadelphia where there is a pizza place on every corner and too many of them are those puffy crusted Greek pizzas which I can't stand.  Mia's was excellent.  Not too much crust for the pizza and well seasoned.  We also had burgers which were good and pasta which was really tasty.  We also got dessert  which was okay,  but the baklava was homemade and really good.  Prices were comparable to home and delivery was fast to the hotel. I highly recommend for visiting families or anyone else in town.  We will use again.",

    "text": "Let me begin by saying that it is not possible to give less than one star, or I would have.  The only stars I am seeing right now are the ones spinning around my head after taking one bite of my Chicken Alfredo that was sent to my house a few moments ago.  My wife and I have ordered from Mia Pizza many times in the past and use GrubHub for delivery services.  In the past, we have had good experiences with Mia Pizza, and it was \"our pizza place\".  Tonight I ordered the \"Chicken\" Alfredo and my life has changed forever.  What I received was noodles covered in \"Chicken\" and Alfredo sauce.  At first bite I thought the chicken was under cooked (strange texture and tart flavor), but I rinsed it off in the sink and this revealed the \"Chicken\" had a lovely gray tint to it, topped off with a strange oily sheen.  My wife took a small bite of the chicken and immediately wretched.  I called GrubHub and simply asked for a refund of the \"Chicken\" Alfredo, a whopping $11.59.  The guy from GrubHub told me he'd have to call the restaurant and ask for the money back.  After about 5 minutes he came back on the line and told me the \"manager\" of Mia Pizza had said he was \"very busy\" and that  I would personally have to RETURN THE \"CHICKEN\" ALFREDO myself for a refund.  He then hung up the phone.  I've gotta tell you, it is a great idea to tick off your customer base AND GrubHub as well.  Sounds like they've got a rocket surgeon playing \"manager\" at Mia Pizza.  On the positive side, I've been meaning to start working out again and I think the stomach cramps I will shortly experience will help with my AB definition.  Mia Pizza has lost a loyal customer and we will go out of our way to let everyone we know that MIA PIZZA is NOT the place to eat.  Steer clear at all costs.....",

Since I live so nearby, delivery makes super fast. AND they are such fast acting ppl... One time I ordered take out and it took only about 20 min to get my food ready... Impressing... well... at least to me.  Quality wise- I don't know much about Turkish cooking but their pizza... woo I just couldn't take it... too greasy and too much cheese for me (if you are into those types of pizza go for it.... their cheese blend tasted good)... But that's about the only thing that I don't like at this restaurant. I almost always order bbq wings that are cooked just right with just enough sauce (Not too much nor too less). French fries-crispy and not too greasy like those of some other pizza places have. Pasta- good, it comes with melted cheese on top I almost thought that I mistakenly ordered a pizza.Pasta sauce wise... restaurants claim that they're homemade but I never believe it... there were lots of onions in Mia's pasta sauce... So I'm thinking they are at least adding chopped onion to their pasta sauce (maybe they're buying sauce with lots of onion in it but I haven't seen such thing).  Overall, I'm pretty happy with their food and will keep order from them.",

What I ended up getting was meat ravioli in Alfredo sauce (which cost more).  When I called back to Mia Pizza I was passed from one person to the next until the guy that took the initial order finally picked up the phone.  When I told him that my order was wrong he proceeded to argue with me.  At that point I got my friend who called the order in on the phone and shut him down.    In order to get my right order I had to hand over my old order to them (which concerns me that they may have reserved that to someone else).  Finally, after two hours after placing my order, I had my food in front of me.  Might I say that it wasn't quite correct again.  The first time I could let it slide, but this is the second time this month that I ordered and got the completely wrong menu item.  After dealing with the wrong food and having to deal with an attitude, I am never coming back here again.",

    "text": "Wow. This calzone was so horrible it was almost amazing. So much (generic) sauce. It wasn't even a veggie calzone it was like eating canned tomato/vegetable soup out of an utterly flavorless and soggy bread bowl. Super runny with virtually no cheese. I'm sure they're great people, delivery was on time but just, wow. Ugh. This is what I get for trying new pizza places. I don't usually say this but I actually would really like my money back.",

I'm also addicted to the fried cheese sticks from this place. Sometimes the delivery guy can't find my work though. Overall it's pretty decent",

    "text": "Okay, so I want to start this review with a disclaimer.  Here it is:  The only items I have ever tried from Mia Pizza are (a) the buffalo chicken pizza, (b) the buffalo fries with mozzarella, (c) the chicken tenders, and (d) the hot wings.  They are all phenomenal.  The buffalo chicken pizza may be one of my favorite foods in the entire world.  I've had buffalo chicken pizzas from pretty much everywhere in the city (including Little Nippers, which is very good in its own right) but always end up coming back this place.  Somehow, Mia's recipe is just exquisite.  Their \"buff chick\" is spicy and saucy and usually cooked to golden brown perfection.  Not only does it have deliciously large chunks of chicken, but it also has crispy buffalo fries cooked under the cheese.  Healthy? No, absolutely not. Absolutely scrumptious? Definitely.  Worth a try if you haven't ever had it? Yes!  The other items are almost as good as the pizza.  The wings are spicy as hell and not soggy.  (Because soggy wings are gross.)  The tenders are crispy, but not dried out.  The buffalo fries with mozzarella have a little kick to them and are usually pretty crunchy.  (Note: The fries are really good with some Lawry's Season Salt sprinkled on top.)  Finally, we sometimes pick up in store and other times have it delivered via grubhub.  (This place isn't eat in.) Today, the guys at Mia have had our order ready exactly when they said they would for pick up.  In my experience, delivery is always pretty quick and the drivers are polite.    If you like spicy pizza, you should for sure give Mia a try.",

    "text": "I have ordered here in the past and the pizza is okay. But this evening was a little different. I ordered an Italian hoagie, because I didn't want pizza. I remember in the past I was not a fan of the hoagie, but I had received a message from the owner stating that things would change. I decided to give it another shot.  Let me tell you, nothing has changed. If anything it's worse than I remember. I requested mayonnaise exactly as before, and didn't get it. No pickles either. The hoagie was a hot sloppy mess. I'm not sure why it was hot, because nowhere on the menu does it warn you that it's toasted, and I certainly didn't request that. Gross. About four slices of meat, a mealy tomato slice and slimy warm lettuce. The lettuce and tomato must have been heated with the hoagie because they were so soggy they were mushed into the soggy bun. There were no onions or cheese to be found in this mess, although that is a detail the menu promises comes standard.   I will not be ordering from this place again, and unless you're sticking to pizza and are drunk enough to forget even that mistake soon, I'd advise anyone to avoid it as well. There are so many great places to eat in this city, and Mia Pizza just doesn't keep up.",

Instead of tossing the wings in bbq sauce,  the sauce was poured sparingly over the wings after they were put in the container, resulting in some wings having no sauce at all.",

    "text": "The pizza is cheap and bland.  I am pretty sure they use pre-made crust despite their advertising of dough made fresh daily.  Maybe it is made fresh daily at some factory, then frozen, then sent to Mia Pizza?  Their wings came with hot sauce drizzled on one side of the wings.  It was weird to eat a fried piece of chicken, then get some hot sauce, then a piece of fried chicken.  Also, they said they came with blue cheese.  They did not...they came with the same watered down ranch that came with the bland pizza.  I honestly wonder why I order from these places that pop up on Grubhub...90% of them are horrendous.",

We ordered it two days in a row and I'm thinking of getting it again tomorrow! The hotwings are so mouth wateringly good you can't stop until they are GONE. It's affordable and they deliver, so if you're visiting Pittsburgh, this is where it's at. don't hesitate, stop everything you're doing and order it NOW! So impressed.",
