I would guess that most people coming here know what to expect - it is definitely not fine dining, but is a nice, cheap option where you can get decent food. The food is fine, and they have some great lunch specials, like all-you-can-eat soup and salad (and the soup is surprisingly tasty). I remember the breadsticks being amazing, but was not that impressed today, so I'm sure if they changed their supplier or if my taste preferences have just changed.",

I went to this particular Olive Garden on a Monday night, and there was a wait when there were clearly open tables in the restaurant.  After being seated in an area of the restaurant that flat out smelled like an old shoe, it took our server about 10 minutes to greet us. Luckily, my friend and I had already gotten our drinks at the bar.  Once the server brought us our soups, she informed us that unfortunately those were the only breadsticks she could give us at the time because the manager was driving to another nearby Olive Garden to get more breadsticks because the restaurant was out.  After eating one bowl of soup and asking for another, it had taken another 20 minutes to get a bowl of soup because more was being made at the time. The only thing saving the review of this particular Olive Garden is that, like always, the food is amazing and delivers. Hopefully other people had more luck dining at this particular restaurant.",

I chose the Crab Ravioli with Lobster sauce, spaghetti with meat sauce, and another Alfredo sauce type pasta. We were already enjoying our salad and breadsticks when our meal came. Two of the 3 pastas were excellent. I was bummed about the crab ravioli because it was very salty. I can be sensitive to salt so I had my husband try it. He thought it was too salty also.  I'm glad we decided to try this Olive Garden. They can be hit or miss with there food. This one was a hit.",

The strawberry daiquiri I ordered was incredibly watery, though, and as you can see from the photo, someone thought it was a good idea to add very sad looking strawberry to it.

    "text": "TERRIBLE, NASTY, ROTTEN, ATTITUDINOUS, ARROGANT, COCKY. I came in for lunch in November and asked for Coke Zero with no ice and a glass of wine from a fresh bottle. IMMEDIATELY the server, also the lady who was acting as bartender, said they only keep the opened bottles for x amount of time, as though SHE GETS TO DECIDE how fresh I prefer my wine. That was my very first red flag that this server was an argumentative know-it-all who did things HER way and was right about everything, leading to the worst experience in dining that I've had in probably years, and the worst at any Olive Garden ever.   So I asked for fresh wine and Coke Zero with no ice. I gave the server a $10 bill as a good-faith gesture of getting part of her gratuity up front by showing I am not some rude ass who stiffs servers with $1 gratuities. She came back with the \"fresh\" wine and my Coke Zero and I started to say, \"Oops, I guess I got you flustered\" -- well, she cut me off right there. Great listener, huh? I was going to say the talk about fresh wine musta made her forget that I ordered no ice in the Coke Zero. She broke into my sentence saying, \"OH, YOU CAN'T FLUSTER ME. I'VE BEEN DOING THIS WAY TOO LONG.\" So then I finished, as she set down my Coke Zero with 200 ice cubes in it. \"Well, I was going to say you musta been a bit flustered because you brought all that ice out.\" At that point, I was the jerk. She took the glass and brought it back sans ice. OK. Then I ordered a \"trio\" (some plate with three items) and she asked if I wanted soup or salad. I said, \"WELL, GEEZ, why not do it as an unlimited soup and salad? You still do that, right?\" She said yes, so I said to go ahead with that.  So the soup and salad comes.  About 30 minutes later, she swings by and asks if everything was OK. I said yes, except for the trio not arriving. She looked at me with a hostile air this time. \"You didn't order that,\" she said. \"You ordered unlimited soup and salad.\"  \"No,\" I said, \"I ordered the trio, and the unlimited soup or salad on top of that.\" Obviously her first impression of being a poor listener had carried through to the meal ordering. At this point, she didn't say, \"Oh, no! I'm sorry!\" or \"Let me fix that\" or \"Whoops\" or \"My fault! I'll put it in right now!\" Instead, she scowled, turned her back and walked off with no words at all.  Next a manager came over and asked what was going on and confirmed the trio had been ordered. I said it seemed odd that he was suddenly at the table handling the ordering as if I had done something WRONG. No, he said, he was \"Just helping out.\"  So the trio came. That was fine. Tasty, even. And maybe 5 or 15 minutes later he brought the check. I put a card in it. Guess what. The check not only didn't comp anything for the rude service and errors, it ADDED extra soup on to the tune of about $5. I waited to bring this up to the manager and he didn't return for THIRTY MINUTES. At that point I was a little steamed. The server had disappeared WITH MY $10 UP-FRONT TIP, as though I were an ASS, he had taken over, and denied anything was wrong, and THEN left me sitting for half an hour waiting to pay. So I explained myself a little more frankly. \"Your server didn't get the order right and walked off like I was a jerk, you take over, and you NOT only don't comp anything, you charge me for MORE than I ordered, then leave me hanging for 30 minutes.\"  His answer? He didn't know I wanted to pay. I ordered the UNLIMITED soup and salad, he said -- that meant I could have wanted to sit there indefinitely.   Really? That is a lie, and an insincere response at best. WHAT'S MORE: He never offered to BRING any more soup or salad to begin with.  Well, that time, he took the excess soup off the bill and I think the trio. Fine. I still waited probably 15 minutes to have the check processed.  Bottom line? Your server here is BETTER THAN YOU, and you'd better worship at her temple. And if you don't, she'll KICK YOU OUT of it and have some insincere liar kick you around further. I STILL left a few dollars in the check presenter. ON TOP of the $10 she made off with.  DO NOT GO.  People like these should be ashamed of themselves.",

I waited about 30 minutes to be seated...during that time I saw 5 people walk out... Several spoke with the manager because they had been waiting for a hour and a half...  I thought... Nah, it would not be that bad... I was seated... I then was ignored by the wait staff for 15 minutes... Finally, the waitress came up and I tried to order.  She warned me that it would be likely an hour more...at this point, I was at 45 minutes at this restaurant... Not even a glass of water.  I said I don't want to be here at midnight for pasta and walked out... They started a promotion today and we're understaffed...  I will not waste my time here... I need to add that the manager was rather rude to a pregnant woman.  This all happened on 10/3/16 from about 6:45 to 7:30",

    "text": "I'm not sure when the food quality dropped off from the last yelp event we attended at the Green Tree location and yesterday's visit to the Pleasant Hills location, but The OG is back to their usual, boring self save for the interactive table computers you now get to play with.  You actually order your own appetizers without any waitress interaction.  Wow, isn't THAT what you've always wanted?  Let's go out to a restaurant and listen to loud talkers & screaming babies while we quietly order our own food...  Nope, I'm NOT a fan.    We had been craving pasta for some time now so when my wife suggested the OG last night, I said, Let's GO!  We were seated promptly as they weren't very busy but unlike other restaurants where they try to seat you NOT on top of other diners, here they led us, or as it actually looked, they HERDED US, into the back corner of the restaurant.  The front half was pretty deserted, but they wanted us to sit right up next to a table of 'fillers'.  You know the type- the people that sit down, adjust the table to their preference, spread their chairs out till their short dinosaur arms can barely reach the table, but so that their belly actually fits in between the table & their spine, completely inconsiderate of other diners...  Yea- the hostess tried to seat us butted right up against their table.  Nope, I don't think so.  We suggested another table, leaving that one as a buffer zone.    Here a friendly waitress came over and made us feel very welcome.  She introduced us to 'table-tron' which I declined, and asked if she would mind it all that much taking our order herself.  She politely accepted but still had to enter our appetizer order into table-tron.  Then I told her we were even ready to order our entrees, which she said don't get entered into table-tron but get written down and hand delivered to the kitchen.  Let me jump ahead, if I may...  Why is it that restaurants NEVER ask you if you are ready for your entrees?  They deliver the App then mid-bite race back to the kitchen to pick up your entrees...  Our App was a combo calamari (which was DELICIOUS), crab stuffed shrooms and fried zucchini.  The shrooms were still bubbling from the broiler when delivered and the zucchini were as hot as molten lava.  We had just enough time to take a couple bites of calamari and I burned my tongue off on a zucchini when the waitress delivered the entrees.  Wow, that was a good thing because (sarcasm alert) I CERTAINLY didn't want to actually eat the App right there in the store.    On to the Entrees...  Kim ordered the create your own pasta and added sausage links & meatballs, yes, I laughed because I knew she would be full even before the entree arrived.  Hers came out looking like the angel hair which she specially ordered had been in the water SO long it was swelled to the size of regular spaghetti... but it was DRY.  Of course it had the sauce & sausage & meatballs on it but do they keep their pasta under a heatlamp drying out till someone orders it, then they dump it on & send it out?  The sausage tasted decent but the meatballs were straight from Sysco.  Why order them out when they taste exactly the same if you cook them at home?   I order the tour of Italy.  Penne with some kind of orange sauce, chicken with moz & provo cheese and lasagna.  The chicken was some sort of combination between grilled breast and chix patty.  It was about as big as a fist but perfectly thin, about a half inch thick.  Do they slice it on a deli meat slicer?  Looks like it.  The lasagna was not what I was expecting.  Stouffers lasagna comes out of the pan looking better than this stuff.  It almost looked like they took a tablespoon of ricotta and plated it, layed a 4\" piece of noodle over it, added a little sauce & repeated one more time.  This display of non-Italian cooking would send every single REAL Italian into cardiac arrest.  Even my mother who has absolutely no Italian in her blood-line makes a Rolls Royce compared to this Hugo.    The salad is the only reason I would return to this location, as the breadsticks are again disappointing.  They taste like Sysco as well, frozen not fresh, dense & not light & airy, warmed in an oven.    Add the OG to the list of places not to go back to.  I'd rather spend the 3 hours in the kitchen with my wife making us exactly what we want instead of being disappointed with this 'Corporate Imitation Italian' ever again...",

To go with my main dish i choose the chicken and gnocchi soup . It was a little salty but still good. The waitress also brought a bowl out for my little man which he was happy about. My main dish was chicken in a wine sauce with risotto. The risotto was a little under cooked but was still pretty good. Chose not to get dessert and will be having leftovers for lunch today.

    "text": "I don't know what's wrong with me, but I'm still an Olive Garden sympathizer, resisting foodie peer pressure to bash them gleefully. A forgotten $25 gift card prompted Kay and I to journey to the OG that started the love affair over a decade ago when my sister and her then beau wanted to reward my unemployed ass for helping them move.   How they actually prepare their food, I couldn't tell you. I am not privy to what goes on in their kitchens, but one taste of their tender, cornmeal-coated calamari (their best appetizer) dipped in that ranchy parmesan-peppercorn sauce, and I no longer care. When they bring out the chilled salad chock-full of tomatoes, greens, onions, and croutons that is skillfully tossed with that exceedingly delicious vinaigrette vs. Caesar dressing, my bias against chains is diffused, and I come to realize that Marilyn Hagerty's humble, Plain-English words are truth --that she is not to be ridiculed.   Braised Beef & Tortelloni was something I had yet to try, and when it came to our table, my gastronomic heart beat loudly for the short ribs fell apart with minimal chewing as did the portobello mushrooms, the very fungi that rival sirloin in sheer heartiness. The al dente pasta, filled with asiago, wallowed euphorically in a severely savory basil-marsala sauce. Some sour cream could have turned this into a dandy Beef Stroganoff.   A slightly freezer-burnt (or not entirely thawed?) Tiramisu let me down a little, but its creaminess and coffee-laden flavors couldn't be quelled by some ice-flakes.   If those preparing OG's dishes are not really cooking, then they are brilliant illusionists, fooling the public (or at least me) into thinking they truly wield culinary magic...or microwaves? Again, I don't know and don't give a bean. The food was tasty on my end.   P.S. The service here was spot-on.   P.P.S. That inaugural visit I mentioned was made memorable by a Drew Carey lookalike with a terrific personality and sense of humor.  P.P.P.S. Spare me the snarky, \"A-ha! You don't know food\" messages in which yinz pitifully attempt to \"debunk\" me. It's not as if I value your opinions, do I?   P.P.P.P.S. I still dig those breadsticks.",

I looked and there were beans and a old tomato in the wedding soup . I asked the server for another bowl because it had old food in it. She bought another bowl and there was a huge potato in it.   It supposed to be wedding soup.. she explained that sometimes the soup get mixed in with the others( well that's gross) she said she would try to find fresh soup.  By this time I didn't want it. Paid my bill she did t discount any of it. Never bought mints or even thanks.   I still tip 20 percent because I was a waitress for many years but today was just a bad experience at this Olive Garden..",

I know OG is not an upscale place, but I do think it is better than sweat pants.  I was there last night and I was not overly impressed with my waitress since she looked unkempt and had food stains all over her.  She was very nice and quick with the service so she got a good tip based on that.  But out of the many OG I have been too, this is by far my least favorite due to the people who go there.  A shower, real pants, and brushed hair are not too much to ask for in a decent establishment.  Seriously....I am in my 20s...if you are an adult, you should wear real pants in public, not pajama or sweat pants.  But that is a whole other issue.  Either way, this OG is okay, but I have been to nicer ones.",

First, we have been greeted by the manager both visits asking how our meal was.    Second, there is a noticeable change in the quality differences as described in my original review.  Our soups have been fresh, hot and not watered down.  Our breadsticks have been hot, and seasoned.  The dinners have been hot, sauced and appropriately sized compared to the other locations.  I cannot express how happy we are that these changes have been implemented...and I hope they continue to stay that way.",

This review doesn't specifically cover one visit, but every time I'm here. The service is always bar none, better than any other OG I find myself at. They always have amazingly fresh breadsticks (win) and my peach tea is always full. They offer refills of soup and salad that you order with your entree, something I've never heard of at the other ones I regular. And when I ask for extra alfredo sauce with my meal? It's never forgotten, and always overflowing (win some more).   Never ending pasta bowl is back now. I'll probably be here a few times before it's over. (Gasp, carbs!)   Happy Eating!",

The meal is about $12 before add ons. It comes with salad and breadsticks (obvi), entree plus a mini dessert.  I went to angel hair, garlic wine sauce and chicken. The pasta was extremely dry and hardly had any sauce on it at all. For dessert I went with the chocolate mousse... amazing.   My bf went with angel hair, alfredo sauce and meatballs. His dessert was the caramel one.   Meal and service were good.  I took a star off because our server and a hostess were talking crap about a busser.

Unfortunately after ordering it took another long wait before our food arrived. Much would have been forgiven if the food was wonderful. It wasn't.  We requested breadsticks without butter because one of us is on a low sodium diet. Our server brought buttered ones anyway,  explaining that it would take a while for unbuttered ones.

It's across the street from Firestone, Goodyear, and Midas, so I find myself here for lunch while I get an oil change or inspection a lot.  The lunch specials are pretty good.  All you can eat soup and salad is fast and a good price.  All you can eat pasta isn't bad either if your appetite is a little stronger.  Dinner entrees rotate with the season, but the staples are always there as well.  I personally like it this way.  Keep what sells but allow one to branch out once in a while if so desired.  For me, I like the tour of Italy and it's usually my go to when I'm here.  Chicken Parm, Lasagna, and Linguine in Alfredo.   Deserts are also good.
