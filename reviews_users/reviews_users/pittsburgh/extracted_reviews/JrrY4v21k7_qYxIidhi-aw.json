Husband really loved the mac and cheese and would get the tofu \"wings\"/ chunks again if the tofu would perhaps be marinated, or smoked or something? straight from the container tofu just ain't gonna cut it. But again, if you have enough of their awesome cocktails, maybe you won't notice, or care!",

    "text": "If you just want to go to a place to hang out, find yourself a booth and relax, Kelly's is just right. The atmosphere of the bar is good and the regular weekday bartender is good. The servers are almost always terrible. Once or twice I have had someone who actually knew how to serve only to never see them again. Also, if you have any complaints for the management, expect the same reaction as you would in some horrible hip retail store. Some of the scenesters think very highly of themselves (and this includes some of the staff), which is amusing since we are all still in Pittsburgh. The place becomes chock full of them after 10pm, so I tend to keep it earlier when there is more of a mix.  The food is decent, the 4 dollar drink special is nice, although I preferred when it was Manhattan's and Sidecars vs Palomas and Mojitos. They are all summer-y drinks so maybe they will keep switching it up?",

It didn't even feel like a bar to me perhaps because they had booths and outdoor seating and everyone, both workers and patrons were fun and enjoyed being there with each other's company.  I loved the mac n cheese and the fish tacos and my drinks were made fast and tasty.  Kelly's was also the perfect place to end up at after going to other venues.

We have been coming here for years and have spent tons of money here when it was actually a cool fun place to go. We have never been treated so poorly in any establishment as we have the last couple times we've been here.  Our male server was WASTED and was more interested in dancing around like a complete idiot and looking at himself in the mirror. He's clearly more interested in himself than his paying customers. Our drinks were horrible and he barely came over to our table. The young athletic chick is horrible too, her lack of experience is obvious but she is apparently manager!!! She was rude to my boyfriend and I as soon as we sat down. Our beers tasted like old tennis shoes. We asked for new beers and she gave them to us for free which was cool. BUT, The customers next to us ordered A LOT of shots and bottled beers while we were there and when she put down their tab she only charged them for 2 beers!!! UNBELIEVABLE. Does anyone do inventory in this bar because she is robbing this place blind. That's not all though, a man came in to visit her and she jumped from behind the bar and started making out with him right infront of the whole bar. EW. The last thing I want to see is my bartender making out and then making drinks. TOTALLY UNPROFESSIONAL and gross!!!! Kelly's used to be my favorite bar but it has definitely gone down hill in a BIG BIG way.",

Music changed from 70's disco to old school punk to classic rock in the hour we were there.  And watch out for the sweet potato fries; they're great, but they come with a garlic aioli which will clog your pores for the next 24 hours.  Great stuff, but avoid it if you're looking to make a love connection (my wife and I loved it so much we ordered a second serving of it).  If Kelly's was in LA, it would be a hipster hangout.  We'll definitely be back next time we visit the 'burgh.",

Regulars are greeted by the bartender and served up their usual drink. I felt like I was in an indie movie!   So in real time, the place has CHEAP happy hour deals! $2 Yuenglings and $4 mixed concoctions. Yesterday was the Presbyterian. It was a mix of Bourbon, Ginger Ale and Soda Water. Not my cup of tea....but maybe someones...perhaps??   The grand jewel of the place is the mac n' cheese. I kept hearing these tales of the most delicious mac n' cheese you will ever feast on. Of course I had to get it! When it came out it looked like the real deal homemade version! Slightly burnt top layer of cheesy goodness. Inside a gooey noodly mixture of cheese, with a strong pepper flavoring. I believe when there was no more noodles to be found, there may have been some bowl licking. For real, that good!   It was sad but kinda funny because a family of four came in with some small children. They wanted to come because they had heard the  mac n' cheese was so good. Well, it's considered a straight bar so they weren't allowed in with children under 18. The mom was like, I called earlier, it's the kids birthday! Too bad....they may have had to settle for some easy mac!",

It was a Saturday at about 10 pm we arrived and found a booth right away. I ordered a vodka red bull but they don't carry red bull(odd) but I ordered a rum and a diet and it was spot on. My date ordered a miller lite which they don't have, bud light either. They only had Iron City and Amstel on light beers.   Bartender was a no nonsense kind of guy but served us right away. We sat in our booth without having to talk over the music or other people so the noise level was even keel. We eventually made our way to the patio into these ridiculously laid back chairs. Could def have some better options for that.   All in all the drinks were cheap, the atmosphere mellow and the employees pretty laid back. Would def reccomend to check out for a few drinks with friends or a to bring a date too. Just beware of the bathrooms :-/",

    "text": "First time at Kelly's tonight-drawn in by their retro neon COCKTAILS sign like a moth to the vodka.   Yuenglings were $2 for happy hour and our Pittsburgh Bites (boneless chicken wings) were only $3.50 and came super spicy, which I dug, but looked like little bricks of...ahem...something you might scoop up while following your dog on a walk.  The tilapia in my tacos was breaded and fried sans spices or herbs, so the main part of my taco had absolutely zero flavor, and was topped with shredded iceberg lettuce, which added a little crunch but not much else. The boring theme was completed by everything being wrapped in a flour tortilla. I don't know about you guys, but for me, flour tortillas with tacos are a huge no-no. Just, why? Why would you do that to a perfectly good taco? I could go on about tacos for days, so anyways, they were salvageable with the loads of guacamole, fresh salsa and sour cream that came on the side.  BUT, on a scale of 1 to 10 the mac and cheese was an 8 and had a crazy crust like you've never seen; charred just shy of being totally burnt, it was sort of sealed into the bowl (since it was baked in the dish). And if you're going to a lounge to have a beer this is definitely the best mac and cheese you're going to get your hands on in the city.  East Liberty is a slumbering restaurant meca until 7 when the trendy folks that are employed around there get off work and head out for dinner and drinks. At 5 when we walked in there were two other tables taken, by 8 when we left every seat was full. The loud chatter over beers echoing off the red walls (Kelly's is going for a 50's diner feel with checkered floors and wide white booths) rounded out the \"lounge\" aspect of it perfectly.  The server was tatted, dreadlocked and pierced, but instead of seeming too \"alternative\" she gave the place a grungy-but-hospitable feel that worked well.",

Based on my most recent visit, about a week ago, I wouldn't give it any stars at all. I went with one person and it took forever to get served. We were brought drinks after a long wait, and the server dashed off without asking if we wanted to order food. Our server disappeared for what felt like an age and when we finally did get her attention it felt like we were bothering her by ordering.  I ordered the mac and cheese because I heard good things, but it was terrible. It felt like Kraft mac that someone accidentally dropped a whole grinder of pepper into. I asked the server why it was so peppery and she said it was usually spicy - there's a difference between spicy and the feeling of eating pure pepper. She said she'd ask in the kitchen what was wrong with it but she never did. After another age of waiting for her to return, the person I was with just handed her a credit card and asked her to charge it without even looking at the check first because we felt like we were going to be there all night.  For one drink and one small food item each we were there for more than two hours, on a somewhat quiet Wednesday night. As I said, my first experience was good but the last one was so bad I don't think I'll bother going again.",

The drinks aren't terribly expensive But the food isn't super cheap.   Like I said, I would totes give this place a 3.5 and if you've never been I highly recommend it! But it's not a 4.   That said, on the right night this place can be a 5 - great ambiance and lots of potential to have a great night here.",

They have daily drink specials and a nice selection of beers on tap.  The bartenders are nice, the patrons are friendly and even if you come alone you will have a bunch of new friends by the time you leave.  Kelly's sort of feels like walking back in time. a 50's diner feel, dark, and cozy. The back porch is a great place to hang out on warm nights but fills up quickly.  Get the mac and cheese if you are hungry. It's stellar.",

And then there was the food, which I would call \"mediocre at best\". My fish tacos consisted of a tortilla, breaded fish (that had unquestionably been frozen 30 minutes earlier and slightly resembled a fish sticks), shredded lettuce (that came straight from a bag). We also ordered the mac and cheese and the Pittsburgh bites. Given that all of these items were also premade, I am not sure how it took 45 minutes to get our food. My best guess is that our waitress forgot to submit our order.  The only points of redemption were the good drink specials and the Honeybee cocktail (which was not on special but was absolutely delicious).",

They have that trendy drink menu which includes cocktails with ingredients like ginger, then have plain old booze too, I've always had great servers here, even when its super busy.   Its loud! People enjoy their banter here, its not dim want to be club bar with pulsing music and people in the shadows. Very small space with lots of seating packed in so be cautious of that, if noise levels grate you.  Food, its decent, the only thing I eat there much is the Mac and Cheese, I could swim in a giant bowl of it and lick it off myself all night long.",

We came on a Saturday night around 9 and despite being pretty full (not hard to do considering the tiny size of this place) we were able to snag a table. Our waitress was attentive and quick with the refills. Kelly's offers about 8-10 micros on draft all ranging between $4-7.50, as well as a pretty extensive cocktail menu.   My friends and I were all starving so we decided to sample some of the snacks Kelly's offered. I had the pork pot stickers which were nice and tender, very flavorful, and pretty well priced (5 for $5.50). One of my friends had the Pittsburgh bites which are essentially boneless wings. I'm pretty sure he liked them seeing as he inhaled the giant portion like he was in a 4th of July eating contest. Our other friend had the chips and salsa. The chips were good but the salsa was terrible, that's to be expected though considering they are using crappy February tomatoes.   I really enjoyed our time at Kelly's and I'll certainly be back.",

It sure beats the mac n' cheese from another area place for drinks, Harris Grill, and at $6, is much cheaper.  I love mac n' cheese with a crusty baked top, and Kelly's version obliged.  I definitely made sure to pick off and eat all the crusty bits along the bowl's rim.  Some of my friends thought it was too peppery the night we visited, but I love black pepper as well.    The sweet potato fries are too thick for my tastes, but in general I like thinly cut fries.  Gin rickeys were on special during Happy Hour on Thursday, which I enjoyed.  The Grasshopper is a nice way to conclude a meal.  Mmm, liquid dessert that tastes like Thin Mints.   I like both Kelly's inside seating area--which suits the old-fashioned cocktails served here--and the deck out back, though the one booth inside that accommodates big groups is in disrepair.  If it's nice out and you have more than 3 friends joining you, head for the back door and the deck.",

Kelly's is dark and cozy, but welcoming. It sort of has the feel of a dive without the griminess of one.  The beer selection is pretty good, both on draft and in bottles. Additionally, the daily cocktail is an excellent special. Even at full price, Kelly's cocktails are a great value (especially for the East End) but at $4, it's practically a steal. Happy hour is a good deal too, with $2 off drafts and half-off appetizers.  The food selection is nothing extensive, mostly the usual bar fare, but what I had was very good. I had an order of fried pickles and a mini mac and cheese. I can't rave about the mac and cheese enough. If you've heard the hype, you should know that it's real. Gooey, cheesey, and baked to perfection. The slightly browned and blackened crust lends a savory flavor to it that you just can't beat. If you only ever get one thing at Kelly's, make it that.  Kelly's is a great place to go if you find yourself in East Liberty and in need of a drink and/or bite to eat. Looking forward to many happy hours here in the future.",

But I've kept coming back because of the drink specials, old school cocktails, the awesome patio, and happy hour food deals.  The happy hour snacks are priced too good to pass up, but honestly, aren't really that special. I think I've ordered the tofu tacos 20 times and I never even really liked them that much, they're just too cheap to pass up. The tofu bites are okay, too, with spicy wing sauces but nothing too special there. The mac n cheese is amazing, like everyone has said, but it is a recipe for a heart attack and doesn't pair well with a night out drinking.  The cocktails, on the other hand, are crazy good. They have a classic menu with old-school drinks that I've never heard of before. A lot of them are knock-your-socks-off strong and unique, and one drink each day is on special, depending on the day of the week.  So I guess what I'm really saying here is, go to Kelly's for a fun atmosphere and grab a couple crazy drinks on the patio with some mac n cheese and sweet potato fries and you won't be broke or disappointed.",

It's burned!  not good!  go to the harris.  their mac n cheese is better.  the service depends on how many of the waitstaff have ovulated recently.  its seriously bi polar.  Sometimes they're nice, other times the will actually tell you just how put out they are to serve you.  If you want to order food, don't sit on the back patio.  I think the staff forgets it exists.  I used to work at Borders when it was open and we'd often go there afterwards for drinks and food.  There was one night the waitress never came to our table, so we went to hte bar and ordered drinks and then she was pissed.  She let us know htis by slamming glasses of water we hadn't ordered down on our table.  We wanted to order food, but she stomped away.    I was so frustrated (but mostly drunk), actually lit the menu on fire to get her attention.  She came right over.  Props to her for not throwing us out, but I think it earned us \"Kelly's cred\" or something bc I've never had a problem since.  Actually, I think I kind of like that the waitstaff is so bitchy.  It's part of Kelly's charm bc it's so consistent.  Most of the food on the menu is tasty.  They make a fantastic hamburger w homemade mustard.  They have $4 daily drink specials, fun cocktails, and a good beer list.  This place fills up quickly on the weekends and if you don't like hipsters, this is not the place for you.  the crowd tends to be a little older, like late 20s - 30s.    Pro tip:  the chance youll get stabbed walking to your car is real, so be careful when leaving hte bar late at night.",

My favorite thing on the menu is the Pittsburgh Bites (tofu, mild) they are deep fried, crispy, and super tasty. Other stand-out items are the halloumi with olives, and tacos. Friends recommend the burger, chicken sandwich, and mac and cheese, but I have not tried these items before. I had a Southwest wrap once that tasted like it was frozen and I didn't like it, I haven't tried the other items, since I'm not into meat, but they also do a nice salad.  There's a lot of hype about famous bartenders and upscale bars in the city lately, and indeed, if you're interested in an expensive cocktail of the \"craft\" variety than Livermore or Harvard & Highland are probably more your speed. Kelly's does classic cocktails, and the bartenders care about what they are making. I have never been displeased with any cocktail I have had here. The beer list is also extensive, they change drafts regularly. I am a wine drinker usually but I have no idea if they serve wine here because I always get cocktails. They are strong, high quality, and reasonably priced. I will admit that there have been nights when I've had a few too many, but thankfully this bar is in walking distance of my home ;)",

The divey laid-back vibe is perfect for happy hour, drinks, dinner, or a late night bite.   The space is cozy and welcoming, and when it's warm there's a patio out back you can hang in. I say hang out, because I don't think I've ever gone for a quick drink or bite. Kelly's is a space you can get comfy in, and probably stay far longer than you anticipate.   Kelly's has awesome Happy Hour specials: discounted drafts, half off apps, and a insanely cheap cocktail of the day. Draft list is consistently great, and if you're not a beer drinker, you'll surely like the cocktails. Across the board, I couldn't be happier to pop out of work over to this spot.   If you are looking for some of the BEST MAC N CHEESE in the city of Pittsburgh, stop reading this and sprint over to Kelly's. The mac and cheese is nuts, and I haven't gone beyond that on the menu because it's MIND BLOWING. Part gourmet, part made by your drunk roommate on a Saturday night, it's delicious and slightly over the top with a ton of different spices. I usually get the smaller serving because there is just so much cheese.  Just writing this makes me realize it's been too long since my last visit. Happy hour anyone?",

The clientele is sort of precious (lots of ironic facial hair) but the drinks are strong and the price is right. They host the local LUPEC (Ladies United for the Protection of Endangered Cocktails) chapter, so they always have interesting drinks you can't find anywhere else (though my dates all insisted on being unadventurous and drinking beer--part of the reason why there weren't any second dates, tbh!) Last time I was in on a rainy Tuesday night, I had a gin rickey and felt like a chubbier, poorer, hopefully more moral Daisy Buchanan.   Their mac and cheese is allegedly the best in the city, and it's really good with a yummy burnt crust, though I prefer Butcher and the Rye's. There's also a cool patio in the back with a tiki-ish theme that's nice to sit in during the summer (don't try to lift those chairs, though!) I'll still go to the Squirrel Cage for my hardest East End drinking, but Kelly's is a nice little place with a cool and inexpensive cocktail selection.",

You want good food, nice bar atmosphere, somewhere to sit, and maybe a nice cocktail (which is rare to get for a good price/quality ratio) or a cheap beer.  Kelly's is not the place to expect someone to talk to you like you're not a regular (the waitresses aren't bitches, they're locals), nor is it the place to order a Coke when the beer flows like [insert a sweet analogy here].  Come in, get a beer, check out the local scene, chill for a while, and try their unbelievable mac 'n' cheese. I guarantee, with an open mind and good company, you definitely won't be let down. If you are, I'll personally come out and pick up your tab (but you'll have to deal with me ordering a bowl or seven of the mac 'n' cheese first).  Great local place. Great Pittsburgh place.",

Instead of saying good evening, which would have been the normal thing, she barked, \"You could have waited for us to bus the table; that would have been, like, a thing??!\" We quickly finished our drinks and departed, all aghast at her behavior, so uncharacteristic of a Pittsburgh bartender.",

If you are looking for good ambiance and just a good drink then Kelly's is the right place for you...that is if you don't mind waiting for your drink for a while. The food is highly disappointing so do not go hungry unless you like overcooked and heavily deep fried. Sunday summer Brunch is probably the only food offer that is worth your while. Again the beach vibes and feel are really cool but it seems they put all of their money into that.",

The $4 drink specials are always worth trying and they also change seasonally. The interior of Kelly's is a beautiful dimly lit bar with red booths. In the summer it's always worth hanging out on the patio. The staff is quick and knowledgeable. Oh and don't forget the food, I always get a mini mac and put hot sauce on top! They have a really great barley wine festival every March and it is the best beer festival in the city- hands down!",

The beer selection is varied with local and international brews and they have a great selection of LUPEC drinks [Ladies United for the Preservation of Endangered Cocktails].   The music comes from the juke box which has a great selection of Johnny Cash, U2, The Smiths, and other treats.  And, if you go in the summer, you can sit in the tiki-style back patio.

    "text": "Kelly's, located at the ever-yuppifying intersection of Shadyside and East Liberty, has the curious distinction of being an avowed non-lesbian bar that refuses the bare minimum of customer service to anyone but lesbians. As a bisexual employee of the software industry, my talents include A/B testing the waitstaff at Kelly's, and boy, have I! The verdict is in: you'll have to be a sister on the Island of Sappho to have an even marginally pleasant experience here. This is totally cool; after all, Lord knows the 'Burgh could use more lesbian bars. But if that's what you are, don't advertise your space as welcoming to anyone and everyone who digs rock n' roll dive bars.  My first experience at Kelly's was also a first date with a lady I've long since left. Our orders were picture-perfect and our waitress was pleasant as could be, stopping by constantly to ask if we needed anything. A repeat visit to Kelly's, for a female friend's birthday party with a damn near all-girl group - the one guy, my husband, was decked out like Bowie from the 70s, which is to say he looked extremely gay - and the beer and liquor was flowing, while the waitstaff was convivial and attentive. \"I could really get into this place,\" I thought.   I was so wrong.  The next two times I came to Kelly's, I made the error of coming with men. This was a Mistake of Epic Proportions, on par with selling Andrea Dworkin on the idea of sex-positive porn. Both times, our waitress (two different waitresses!) ignored our table for as long as they possibly could. My second go-round with bringing men to Kelly's left us sitting in a near-empty bar for 25 minutes. We were about to leave when we finally got service. My first angsty waitress acted like she was doing me a favor by taking my order, and the second didn't make eye contact, preferring to grunt and scribble on her note pad. I don't think she said one complete sentence to us. And so I kept getting the beers and the guys kept getting my martinis, both times. Our mac n' cheese on the first trip was burned, which I assume was the kitchen's way of saying \"fuck you\" for bringing Y chromosomes to the place. On my second trip, I ordered a gin and tonic, and got - no joke - a 16-oz. glass of tonic water with lime. When I politely asked for gin, our waitress tossed me a disgusted grimace and heaved a sad sigh, as if she'd just been sentenced to 50 years in the clink.   Other male friends back in Pittsburgh have reported similar issues with Kelly's, so I'm not imagining the gender-biased service discrepancies. And they're not just rude, nor are they merely bigoted. They make going out WORK. This venue gets one star because it offered me: a) a patio providing comfortable respite in the summer, b) a jukebox with some 70s and 80s alt/punk hits I love, and c) clean bathrooms. However, a one star rating this will stay because loud music, toilets, and outdoor seating are bare-minimum offerings when you build a bar aimed at the under-40 alt-rock set. And sadly, as East Liberty continues to gentrify, even those elements have slipped.   If you like service with a scowl, fantasize about lighting 20-dollar bills on fire, or get off on watching kids with Elvis Costello glasses who've literally just learned how to drink queue up \"music\" destroyed by Auto-Tune, come to Kelly's.",

Me and a group of friends tend to go here once a week or so, but we're hoping the new hotels in East Liberty might have better bars when they open. They never stick to their advertized opening hours. If it's summer they may stay open til 2, but past September they make every effort to close as early as they can. Staff are haughty without any reason to be. Super-obvious, badly curated punk on the stereo. It's Pittsburgh, it's about as good as you can expect in this area. Which isn't saying much.",

    "text": "Kelly's is: adorable, formerly uber-hipster, currently populated largely by grad students, delightful, dark, red, art deco bar with beautiful booths and an amazing secret patio, where I actually had one of the most painful break-up conversations of my life - fortunately I was doing the breaking, so it didn't spoil the space for me!   The mac & cheese is one of the best in the city, and the sweet potato fries are pretty good. in fact, there are a number of tasty food items on the brief menu, but the mac & cheese is the super star.   The drink menu is delightful, and the bartenders here can whip up stylish trendy drinks as easily as the beautiful endangered classics. LUPEC (Ladies United for the Preservation of Endangered Cocktails) makes Kelly's the centerpiece of some wonderful women's history action, and for this alone, Kelly's bartenders should be commended. LUPEC has tabletop information about women's history and classic cocktails year-round. Be prepared to drop $$ for your mojito, but rest assured it is probably the best you could buy in PGH. Trust me, I tried them all. The prices are a little high, with my expectations based on the crowd they draw.   The wait staff here is notorious. If you are friends with someone working there, you will probably get amazing service, and call those who complain liars and wimps. If you don't know someone, be prepared to exercise your patience. I'm not saying it's not worth it, but it can be extraordinarily trying.   The jukebox is another highlight - patsy cline alongside the pixies? Be still my heart. Some of Pittsburgh's more talented DJs spin themed evenings regularly at Kelly's, but there's not room for dancing and you'll get filthy looks if you try.   Basically, this used to be like the Brillobox, before the B-box existed. Now it's a little less insane, but still often packs them in. You may wait a long, long time for a table. If you get food service on a Friday night, God is probably smiling directly at you with freshly-bleached teeth and a cosmic sunbeam.",

It was a little odd to hear so much from one group.  It reminded me of hanging out at a friends house and listening to specific songs from one artist to understand some type of music grow the artist experienced over a period of time.  The bar food is the typical menu.  The boneless wings were good.  Best part was the wings were not breaded.  The chips and salsa were homemade and fantastic.  Decent beer menu, but the oddest thing was a Yeungling and a Magic Hat #9 cost the same at $3.50.  Magic Hat #9 is a great micro brewery (retail cost $1.25) compared to Yeungling is the oldest brewery in America and perhaps the greatest cheap beer available (retail cost $0.83).  So I drank Magic Hat.",

It has a super laid back atmosphere and they always have good music playing. Be on the lookout for when Zombo DJs, because that's the best. It does get super crowded on the weekends and during happy hour, so go early. But in the summer months it's especially nice because they have a fairly large back patio, making it easier to get a table.   The food is pretty good (Pittsburgh bites and the mini mac were my favorites) even though they got rid of the greatest item on the menu-- the tater tot poutine. They have a decent beer selection and a really good list of retro cocktails. Every night there is a different cocktail special for $4 all night and the happy hour from 5-7 let's you get appetizers for half off.",

Too bad she was the only one working the non-bar area, though, because it took a while to get our drinks and food. Your beer list is nice, though sometimes I think it's a bit too expensive. $5.75 for a Franziskaner? It's a darn good pint, though.   You make the best mac and cheese I've ever had. I know it's weird to go to a bar for mac and cheese, but there it is. And you do it so well, especially with a little hot sauce added to the lava-hot bowl. I'd ask you for the recipe, but since it's only $6 I'll come to you rather than trying to make my own.  Nice music last time too - not too loud, since it was still only 8:30. I think there was some Sting (and the Police) playing, and then maybe a Shirley Bassey album. A strange mix, yep, but I liked it.  The dining room was surprisingly uncrowded. I've visited you a few other times and jockeyed to get a seat. It was nice to walk in and get a seat right away, and even nicer that the room wasn't filled with smoke this time. Okay, some smoke, but less than on previous occasions.  So yeah, Kelly's, thanks for a good time. I'll come back on a Monday for the $4 mojito special.  See you soon!",

I understand mishaps can happen, places can have \"off\" nights, but the bartender's behavior impacted our experience and the experience of those around us so negatively it warranted a review. She was a complete train-wreck, stumbling, slurring her speech, and couldn't make correct drinks. I tried to tolerate the behavior while I waited almost thirty minutes for a drink; she was grinding and dancing and having a good time. However, after a patron interrupted her dance party to emphasize customers were growing impatient she was RUDE. She couldn't handle the cash drawer, made the wrong drinks, and was nasty. A couple beside us pointed out the only positive experience they had that evening was she was too much of a disaster to remember to charge them for over half of their drinks. Kelly's- keep the stumbling and slurred speech on the customers side of the bar.   If you go in for a drink, look out for terrible bartender with black rimmed glasses, poor sleeve work and chest tattoo.",

Mid 30white male with dread locks. Incredibly rude. One word answers to question. Literally threw change down on the bar. Threw bottle into the well after making a gin and tonic. It was a very average night and not that busy. Everyone I was there with noted on how disrespectful and unpleasant he was, and how uncomfortable it made them.   Kelly's=awesome Kelly's bar tender= not awesome at all",

He complained about how many hours he had to work. I would have expected more patience from a man that's been growing his hair for 10+ years. Dude should be a vacuum salesman because he sucks.

Every once and a while my friends and I plan a trip to Kelly's for drinks and appetizers, but what has most consistently placed me inside Kelly's is the long wait at BRGR. I'm not knocking Kelly's, but the honest truth is that I didn't really frequent Kelly's for anything more than a few drinks or some fries. For a while, I didn't give them the time or credit that they deserve. I'm usually in the area to have dinner, but Kelly's is generally less packed and has good drinks. Its the ideal place to stop by if you need to kill some time, or if you want to get drunk, or have a laid-back dinner date. Whatever floats your boat.   If I intend to head to Kelly's, its for happy hour. They even have happy hour on the weekends. They have 1/2 priced appetizers, $2 off drafts (I think its $2 off..), and a special drink of the night (I believe its $5). They have grilled a Halloumi & Olives appetizer that's awesome, great fresh cut fries, and  mac n' cheese. ANNNDDD they have ice cream sandwiches. I've had mint, pumpkin, and chocolate chip, and I recommend them all.  The only thing I've had at Kelly's that I didn't like was the fish tacos. I would describe them as gross. They were basically fish sticks inside of a tortilla. I would not order them again or recommend them to anyone.",

I've been here on a crowded Saturday and though it was hipster city the vibe was still chill and I was able to have a good time. I've stopped in a few times by myself and bartenders are very friendly and knowledgeable.   The drinks are around $6 a pop and poured well. Food size is good for the price, though the only thing to write home about was the Mac and cheese. Very yummy cheese sauce and I typically hate elbow Mac but this was delish.   It's a nice quiet bar to stop in for a drink if you're in between things, and if you have a good group of friends during happy hour then it can get fun as well. Definitely one of the more \"bang for your buck\" options in that part of town.",

A perfectly crusted cheese covering a pit of ooey gooey cheesy macaroni. It just makes me drool thinking about it. How about a drink to wash down the cheesy goodness? You can't go wrong with their IPAs and cocktails. I, personally, like their margaritas. Setting the mood are the DJs playing a wide range of tunes. I'm sure you'll be moving to the beats of a couple of their musical selections.  Overall, this is my go-to hipster/divey bar. Great happy hour specials, great food, and good music!

Speaking of hipster, I must have been present during hipster night.  The irony here was that the was I was dressed (coming straight from work) I kind of fit in.    My black rimmed glasses did not tell me any lies in here when I was going over the draft menu.  So many different ones to select from that I wasn't sure which I wanted more.  Of course I tried the Brooklyn Chocolate and then followed that with an East End Winter.  Both delicious, both worth the wait/price.  Staff here seem to miscommunicate with one another.  When we first entered we seated ourselves at a booth and the waitress came over to let us know that due to her not feeling well she was going home and that if we wanted anything we would have to go to the bar.  Fine by us, no harm there.  Went up and ordered the first round and the bartender told us due to the tap taking a while she would bring it to our table, great.  While we were waiting the ailing waitress came back by to tell us that the bartender was not going to bring us our drinks.  At that point I wanted to ask how she was feeling as she had not left, but opted to ignore her.  Our drinks were delivered and we were fine.  The music on this particular night was a mix from the 60s which was fine by me, old tunes are good tunes.  Even for as small of a space the DJ was crammed into, people were still in front of him dancing it up.  Maybe in the near future I will come back here and try their food selections, I'm hearing some good things about this place food wise, but if I do, that will be an updated review.",

No biggie.   My boyfriend and I got fish sandwiches and shared a mini mac to see what the hype was about. The fish sandwich was really good! The breading was super crisp and the bun was perfect. Love how they added hush puppies. The mac was good - this is probably an unpopular opinion but I think it was a little hyped up. Don't get me wrong, it was really good but not the best I've ever had.   The next time I come back will probably be for drinks and food at the end of a night out.",

    "text": "$4 cocktails and mac n' cheese is there specialty...hmm...sounds like the best thing I've ever been apart of! Kelly's is a great spot with excellent food in an awesome setting. The restaurant is truly something out of a movie. The vibe and decor doesn't try to be cool, it just is. I know how cheesy all of that sounds, but it's the truth. Now in Pittsburgh, you go into a restaurant and they have spent all of their energy on picking out deer heads and granite table tops and no thought was given to the menu or level of comfort you want your guests to feel. Sometimes there is just a space that speaks for itself and that's all that is needed. Kelly's is that pace. The old booths and relaxing atmosphere could easily read dive bar...and to an extent that is a truth. But the great cocktails and awesome food prevents it from being overly kitschy.   Each day of the week there is a cocktail special that is $4. Mondays are Presbyterians but there are other classic cocktails on the board such as a Cuba libre. It doesn't matter if you get the fried shrimp platter with hush puppies or a simple BLT, it is all done right. The prices are also spot on. The other day, my bf and I got two meals, one beer for him and a cocktail for me...the bill totaled under $25 before a tip and was delicious! The service is good and the wait staff is helpful. I have no complaints and don't expect to ever.",

He perceived this as some sort of infraction, and from there, we had to get out of there. I let my displeasure be known in an ill-advised way, but unless you're Anthony Bourdain, you can expect to be treated like garbage at this place.",

Downside, for me personally, is the food and lack of cold water or ice. Drinks are awesome!!Service is awesome! Menu isn't bad at all but, very minimal. Not a foodie place but would be a fantastic place to meet for 1st drink and a place to start the evening. Will be back for appetizers but, more for cocktails. Thanks guys! Great service, great atmosphere and personalities!",

The interior gets little revamps and updates here and there (like the menus not too long ago) but the overall spirit has stayed the same.This was my favorite happy hour when I moved to Pittsburgh and it's still hands down the best deal around, not to mention the atmosphere is great. The vibe is a little old-school and completely chill, and the clientele is diverse rather than creepy or obnoxious. The drinks are strong and the food is delicious, so there's literally nothing not to like. I've taken a few new groups of friends here recently, and everyone raves about it.   A few things to look out for...Kelly's hosts LUPEC (Ladies United for the Preservation of Endangered Cocktails) so order from that menu if you want to drink something fun and interesting. They have the same rotating $4 cocktail on each day, so check out the board behind the bar and make it a habit to come back on a weekly basis for your favorite one! Happy Hour is on Saturdays as well as the weekdays, so your weekend just got a whole lot more fun. They also have a patio, which apparently takes a lot of people by surprise. Cheers!",

The only food I've tried was the mac and cheese, which was ok given how much it cost.  Kelly's has two major issues: cleanliness and service. The booths are covered in crumbs, regardless of the time of night, and the tables often need wiping. Mysterious sticky stains abound.  The service would be so-so if not for this crazy policy: let's say you sit at a table. No waiter has been paying attention to you, so you go to the bar to get a drink. Are you allowed to bring that drink back to your table? No, you have to drink it at the bar! It's a kind of catch-22.  For these reasons, I have to give a 2 star rating - there are better bars around.",

So, what I ordered may not be the best combo but, it's what I wanted.  Why 3 stars? Well, when we walked in we weren't sure if we should seat ourselves or wait for someone. A worker walked past but didn't say anything so we found a table and popped a squat. No one noticed us so after about 10 minutes I walked up to the bar and asked for menus. The bartender handed them over then asked where we were sitting. After I told him we were in a booth, he assured us someone would be over. At the time it wasn't a huge deal but once we noticed the time, we realized how long we had been sitting there. That's my only negative but now that I know, I'll just order at the bar from now on when I visit.   We ordered tacos and mac n cheese. Crazy combo, I know but they both were good.  While not authentic tacos were yummy. The mac n cheese...good Lord was it good. It looked a little charred when it got to the table but one bite ruled out all of that foolishness. It was comforting, cheesy and just downright good! I had a cosmopolitan to wash it all down and that was perfect!!!  I am looking forward to visiting again and will update my review at that time, if needed.",

It's built styled after an old diner [It may have once been an old diner] with the bar to the left of the entrance, some seating to the right and a cool court yard in the back of the bar.   This is the place that the staff comes after they have closed their own restaurants. And not just the immediate surrounding ones, but from downtown. [not there's some veteran commitment]. And I completely understand why. The drinks are reasonable, especially for it's \"too chic\" neighbors, the rotating craft beer list changes often no matter the season change or not. And the food is good. Try the tuna melt with cheddar or the pittsburgh bites appetizers [which come in hot or mild/ chicken or tofu]. Most crave the Mac'n'cheese which you can get in a Mini version for $4 if you are not able to stuff all the scrumptiousness into you at once, but beware, it's quite peppery.  The signature drinks are made quickly and great and all the bartenders have great character. Every once in a while there will be a live spinning DJ [something I wouldn't expect whatsoever] in the front corner of the bar.  Naturally, as it needed when your clientele is current or previous restaurant people, having a smoking area in the back is an absolutely must. Best is of course late Spring and Summer nights where you chat the day away with your friens and colleagues.  Love it come again and often",

    "text": "Kelly's has been on my to-visit list forever, but I finally received the opportunity to check it out on Wed.  I was planning to go to Burgatory with a friend to claim my free birthday milkshake, but a previous commitment ran late to the point that we were unsure if we'd have sufficient time before closing.  Since my friend had also suggested getting drinks, I suggested that we try Kelly's instead, so we headed over.  When we walked in, nobody came to greet us, so we seated ourselves at one of the booths.  Upon doing so, a hipster waiter, complete with large gauges, tats, and interesting hair handed us menus.  He told us that the drink special of the night was a rusty nail, which consisted of Scotch and Drambuie (orange liqueur) for $4, so we both decided to try it.  It was smooth, but quite strong, to the point that it burned a bit going down.  The ice thinned it out as we drank, however, so by the time we finished it, it was substantially thinner.  Because we were hungry, we decided to get some snacks to go with our drinks.  As a mac and cheese snob, I had to order the mac and cheese, since I'd heard of its claim to fame as one of the best in PGH.  Consistent with my preferences, this mac and cheese is of the baked variety, and comes with a crust on top, but has a sharp cheddar sauce that is surprisingly creamy underneath. Although it didn't beat my current front runner for best mac and cheese in PGH (Carmi), it's definitely in the top tier of mac and cheeses (score: 9.0/10).  Based on my recommendation, my friend ordered the sweet potato fries with cajun aioli.  When they came out, the fries appeared more like chips, but thicker (see photo).  While the flavor was very good, esp. hot, the texture left something to be desired, since they lacked crispiness or crunch.  Overall, I enjoyed the drinks and food at Kelly's.  The ambience was interesting--something of a cross between a bar and a diner--and came off as hipster without trying too hard (a la Wingharts) or being pretentious.  My only complaint was that the music was a bit loud--not so much that I had to shout across the table, but enough to be slightly annoying.  I don't have any complaints about the service, except that I was carded (I'm not usually carded at bars anymore--but then again, my friend is a couple years younger than me).  I'd definitely be up for stopping back in, esp. to try the much-talked-about happy hour, and some of the other interesting, less common drinks served there.",

I took a sip, as did my fiance, it was pretty bad tasting so I decided I would wait to get her attention. The waitress realized first she made a mistake, asked if we wanted it anyway as she would comp it if we did. We declined and we watched her take it to the table behind us....never again.

Their fries are fresh cut tasting (can't actually confirm they are really fresh cut, but they look like it) albeit a bit greasy. Their beyond burger is good too! Wasn't seasoned with anything but it still tasted perfectly fine with the usual lettuce, tomato and onion. Basically what I am trying to say is.. if someone invites you here, GO. Get a drink.

    "text": "I spent a Monday afternoon at Kelly's after reading an article announcing Kelly's as the quintessential Pittsburgh bar.  Kelly's has the classic appearance of an urban dive bar, but never did I imagine, after all the accolades in the press, Kelly's would be a tried and True dive.  Dark, dingy, and just about empty, Kelly's did greet me with Hendrix in the main room, and Metallica's \"Seek and Destroy\" in the bathroom.  I ordered my vodka and \"Pittsburgh Bits\" from a very normal and pleasant bartender.  Yet, the other patrons, with long ZZ Top beards, were straight out of that tv show \"Duck Dynasty.\"  I have to admit, they were quite funny, but the tune from Deliverance was playing in the back of my head.  This is not the kind of bar any dude's wife or girlfriend would feel comfortable.   Kelly's isn't the quintessential Pittsburgh bar, but it is the quintessential dive bar.  If you need a depressing, dark bar to wallow away in, Kelly's is your kind of place.  When I'm in a depressive, self destructive mood, I just rather watch a dark, disturbing Scandinavian movie which helps me realize most of the world is depressed. Then I am ready for a bar where folks are laughing and happy, enjoying the human condition.  That seems more like Pittsburgh to me.",

My friend thought he had done something wrong so he apologized. The bartender turned violent and manhandled my friend all the way out of the bar.   We have been to bars all around Pittsburgh and have gotten along with all kinds of people. Never had a record of troublemaking. This was a horrible experience for us.   I understand that one bad review doesn't mean too much to you guys, but please look into this. I even went to the bartender and asked him politely if we did anything wrong. He was quite abrasive in his response to me as well.   This is in no way fair. I have never faced this kind of behavior since the 2 years I've been in Pittsburgh.  As a consolation, the Mac n cheese was pretty good.  P.S. If you look at your one star reviews. You will find that a lot more people have been in the same situation as us with the same bartender.",

With the pleather seats, dim lighting, and dark red walls, Kelly's seems like something right out of the '50s or '60s. I guess some people find that divey, but I actually thought it was kind of hip and romantic. Definitely a unique atmosphere worth coming out to Shadyside for.  The cocktails are great, and the selection is unparalleled. This is definitely a good place to get out of your cocktail rut and try something you wouldn't normally order. I had the Presbyterian, basically bourbon and ginger ale with a little bit of club soda thrown in. There's a rotating $4 cocktail special, even on weekends! But even if you eschew the $4 bargain, cocktails are reasonably priced at  $6-8.  Our waitress was awesome, so friendly and attentive! She made all of our drinks herself and absolutely killed it. Apparently Kelly's is known for their baked mac 'n' cheese, which you can even order in a \"mini\" portion, but I skipped it this time. I'll be back!",

It's authentic, let's face it hipster dive bars suck, and I'm guessing (what do I know I'm a tourist?) it has been here fore-evah and seen the fortunes of East Liberty rise and fall.  The decor alone is worth visiting for, there are booths and barstools, a jukebox, neon signs, and there's a ton of linoleum. The colour scheme skews towards red and black and the lighting is just dark and dingy enough to have you squinting when you emerge outside into daylight. There's a patio/garden out back - but I didn't go there because that's not dive-y enough for me! The servers are good, I mean it's not like we are going to become friends after a couple of visits, but they were welcoming enough and efficient. The customers were a mix of all sorts of people with a good mix of age groups. Kelly's serves bar food but we only came for drinks. There's a surprisingly good range of draught beers and cocktails available. The daily happy hour has beers at $2.00 off, half-priced appetizers and a daily $4.00 cocktail. Yes, you read that correctly - Four. Dollar. Cocktails. - insane right? If you're in the neighbourhood please stop by Kelly's and show them some love, places like this are disappearing fast and getting harder and harder to find. There's plenty of fancy pants bars with $10/15 cocktails but when did you last have a decent $4.00 one in a real authentic bar? Exactly.",

They also have a $4 speciality cocktail every day and you can't go wrong with just ordering their old fashioneds and manhattans, which are some of the best priced in town.   It's one of my favorite places to meet up with friends and catch up, as it's a very unassuming place. Sometimes it's hard to find a table though, and it's not really the best bar to stand in.

They are associated with the local chapter of LUPEC (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lupec.org%2F&s=c0267a6a6e4d2aa986424c4736e17c4682c2c9b6a48aea8463c85ffb93698c9a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">lupec.org</a>) and therefore have some just wonderful cocktail suggestions.  I often like to try something different, though have found a few favorites there as well to just be amazing.  Their food warrants note as well, in particular the item I go there fore the most - their macaroni and cheese.  It is, without a doubt, some of the best mac and cheese I've ever had in my life.  It comes out in a bowl molten hot, the top of it just perfectly burnt.  Biting into it right away is somewhat foolish, yet I can never resist.  Must try.",

But do NOT go on a Friday unless you want to wait 20 minutes without anyone helping you, asking for a cocktail menu and having them tell you it's long and unavailable and a waiter who doesn't know what is in any of their dishes.  Or maybe you enjoy that, in which case you should apply for the Friday night staff, you'd be a great anti-social addition.   Any other time Kelly's has a great menu, awesome cocktails and friendly bartenders. But watch out for snatchy Fridays.",

Suffice it to say, my Belvederes-going friends like it, my Southside-going friends like it, my Harris Grill-going friends like it, literally everyone I've taken here has liked it. It's cozy, it's chill, the outdoor patio is awesome, and the drinks are consistently good AND cheap. Every day a different classic cocktail is on special, which is a fun way to try something new. The beer list is short but solid.  I have to confess that I'm not the biggest fan of Kelly's food. I know the mac & cheese gets rave reviews, but I think it's just okay. I usually order it anyway if I get hungry because it's probably the best thing on the menu, but I'm just not that into the cheese they use. The potstickers are pretty good too. The service can be hit-or-miss. Overall I wouldn't go out of my way for Kelly's (if you are craving mac & cheese, head up the street to Union Pig & Chicken for a way better version), but if you're in the area and in need of a good, cheap drink, it will totally hit the spot.",

The server also refused to acknowledge that my other forms of ID (credit card, school ID, etc) matched my driver's license. It seemed as though the server was just set on not serving my party and I.   Minnesota licenses are made out of a rubber-like compound, which may arouse some suspicion, but seriously at least try to verify my ID in some objective manner. He also stated that because my party had licenses from different states (we are students), \"clearly\" that meant all of our IDs were fake.     My experience at Kelly's was quite upsetting.   AVOID if you have an out-of-state or international ID--they only trust Pennsylvania driver's licenses!",

I hadn't been there in a couple of years, but remembered it fondly.    Never made it in.    We arrived at 4.30p (hoping to beat the rush of Friday afternoon commuters) but found the place locked.     No sign on the doors with the hours of operation.     The lights were on and a staff member was standing behind the bar, sorting something.     We knocked on the door.  Nobody came.   We knocked on the window.  The woman behind the bar didn't even look up.    I didn't have my phone and my buddy's phone doesn't have Web access, so we called 411 for the bar's number.    Called the bar TWICE.  Nobody answered the phone.    WTF?    Are you THAT successful that you can't (a) post your hours and (b) you can show even a modicum of good customer service?  Or was it because we weren't hipster dofusses (dofi?) you didn't want us in your establishment.  We went down the street to another bar and enjoyed ourselves for several hours and spend a couple of hundred bucks on food and drink.",

Inside is a bit to dark and loud for my taste.  The drinks and food are both very good. I do love the mac and cheese; it is exceptional. Everything else on the menu is solidly above average bar food. The drink menu is all $6 and is all retro cocktail style drinks. I have had a mixed experience going off the beaten path on the drink menu. I usually stick to a Manhattan (they make a pretty good one). The beer selection is quite good too. Usually they have 8 or so micros on tap plus a pretty solid bottle list.  The service can be a bit hit or miss. As longs as you are willing to hang out for a bit you will be fine, but I have ended up sitting for a long time waiting to get my drink. Usually they have two waitresses for the whole bar, which is not enough, so it is understandable.  Summary: Go check it out during the summer and hang out on the patio. Get the mac and cheese.",

Definitely awesome for people watching  3) On most nights the music is kick-butt and very eclectic. 80s New Wave one minute, and the next is blues, followed by 1940s big band.  4) Their cocktails list is amazing and has a bunch of retro drinks you would never see anywhere else because they are probably as old as my grandparents. Grasshoppers, Pimm's Cups, legit Mojitos.  5) OMG THEIR MAC AND CHEESE IS AMAZING",

    "text": "This sexy hipster bar is located in the east end of Pittsburgh near to the universities and hospitals of upmc. It's close to the new bakery square area in east liberty. The crowd seems to change depending on time of night. After work it's a mix of young professionals and grad students, at night it's hipsters. There is a good blend of people, one night I met an Alaskan fisherman who was definitely insane. That same night I met an artist visiting from NYC. It's a low lit and cozy place, especially in the winter.  The beer selection is very good, 12 taps of craft and micro brews ranging from local offerings by east end brewery to victory, stouts, stone, lagunitas and a couple of Belgians and a barley wine.  Cocktails are very good, strong pours and sort of swanky with a specialty list of mostly classics...no wimpy drinks here but good mojitos.  The food is a cut above regular bar food. Fish tacos, huge burgers, fresh cut fries, boneless chicken bites, chips salsa that are homemade and fresh and...the kicker....the best frickin Mac n cheese on the planet. Not that you would ever think to order Mac n cheese in a bar, but it is perfect with a hoppy ipa. It comes out bubbling hot with a nice brown crusty top.perfect on a cold fall night!  The atmosphere is combo hipster bar cum 40s deco cocktail lounge with a juke ranging from lounge music to old country/rockabilly to devo, clsh, gang of four and other punk/new wave.  The place has a cozy patio that is lit by Christmas lights complete with ivy covered walls and a thatched roof hut. The place is a little young for me but I really like it. It reminds me of cozy low lit spots in the village of NYC",

    "text": "Kelly's is a bit of an enigma wrapped inside a contradiction for me.  On one hand, the inside of the building looks updated (recessed lighting, good AC, clean surfaces).  On the flip side, the tables, seating, and sign out front are a bit retro.  The tables are the kind you imagine at an old diner and the seats are plush leather--some of which are a little torn up.  The sign out front echoes from a 1950's diner and gives me the impression I'm coming to a place out of Pulp Fiction.  However, instead of hearing music Travalta could do the twist to, it's music from today's top 40's list with loud pumped-up bass.  I don't know what to feel, so I just feel confused.  I probably could have been persuaded into thinking Kelly's was actually a trendy bar that just looks retro, but the food was straight up bar food: kielbasa, sweet potato fries, and Pittsburgh Bites/Poppers (I can't exactly remember what they were called, but they were basically a cross between chicken nuggets and boneless chicken wings).  I wouldn't say any of the aforementioned dishes were particularly inspired--just decent bar food.  However, the Mac N Cheese is a completely different story.  I wouldn't go as far as calling it divine, but it was really tasty.  The \"normal\" sized serving is enormous--easily a main course (which I believe it technically is).  Service the first time I went, which was during happy hour, was.... curt?  I mean, our waitress came and took our order, but there were no pleasantries.  Our drinks came as hurried as our waitress left after dropping them off.  The second time I went, which was around 9:30pm on a Thursday, service was little bit more friendly.  Maybe our first waitress was just been having a bad/busy day.  Lastly, Happy Hour did seem very happy to me.  While appetizers are 1/2 off, it is impossible to tell from looking at the menu what is considered an appetizer vs. an entree.  I thought we ordered all apps, but turns out we were about 50% right on that.  The fries and nugget things are apps, but the Mac N Cheese and kielbasa dish are not.  The drink part of happy hour isn't especially exciting--especially if you don't drink beer like me.  While there was a decent price on the draft beers during happy hour, they only have one cocktail (changes daily) that is slightly discounted.    I would come back to Kelly's for the intriguing atmosphere and the Mac N Cheese.  I just wouldn't get my hopes up too high for an awesome happy hour or exceptional food.",

Moths to the Noble Gas flame, people seem to slither their way to these oasis's of the night, incubating amongst each other in a haze of sensory saturation.   Kelly's beckons to the person who wants to sit and have a beer, the person who may want to catch someone's eye without filtering through waves of affliction shirts over the rancor of the latest Young ___zy song, perhaps someone who wants to wear argyle and sport a mustache and still think its not ironic that he(she?) is trying to be ironic, the person who simply wants to enjoy a solid bev for a price point for \"chincy\" Pittsburghers.   Me? well, I like a stiff drink and 70's decor. Somewhere in a previous life I wore nothing but polyester. More like Miami Vice, or maybe Boogie Nights. Either way, environment is always friendly, or intimate, depending on what you wish.   You cant go wrong with a French 57, the mac and cheese is all sorts of nom nom, and the tab for a night at Kellys is something you can feel comfortable taking home, even if you aren't taking anything else.",

I was so happy for the amazing happy hour and specialty drink specials every night of the week for 4 bucks. The food is great too- taking unique spins off of old dishes like mac and cheese (sooooo yummy). While the service isn't amazing, just chill and pull up to a diner booth and enjoy the atmosphere. The patio in the back is a mainstay, and is perfect once the weather gets warm enough. One complaint I would have is that the DJ sometimes plays music a bit too loud, but otherwise this place should be on any Burgher's must-visit list!",

I'll never forget that day, one because it was always awesome to hang out with my grandpa, and two because I bet that was the last time that the place was swept.  The drinks here are interesting, and the Moscow Mule (a mix of vodka, sweet lime, and ginger beer) is one of the coolest drink to order.  A good selection of beers, and decent bartenders make the bar the highlight of Kelly's.    The last time we were there (Thursday), they had live music from DJ Zombo, whose radio show I adored when I was in under grad, so that was a little extra bonus.  The food is, honestly, pretty terrible, but they are known for their mac and cheese.  Being good at making macaroni and cheese is about as impressive as being REALLY good at pooping.  There isn't too much that can go wrong in the process, so I will say that it's every bit as delicious as any other time that I have had delicious mac and cheese.    It always happens that we arrive here when I'm starving, so I've managed to dig through the menu.  Much like the food that they eat in the first Matrix movie, I feel like whenever I eat here, I'm just doing it to survive.  With all of the new restaurants that are in the area, I would recommend grabbing something to eat before you head to Kelly's.  This place is more for drinking anyways.  The waitstaff is pretty rough.  You'll end up walking to the bar to get a drink if it's a busy night, and that's for the best really.  I have never had a night here where at least one of my drink orders hasn't come back all effed in the a.  This is kind of why I'm giving it a 3.  If you're in the area, it's definitely worth checking out, just watch out for the sass.",

We were there on a Thursday night, probably from 7:30 until 9 or so. I was never super busy, but always people there. Our server was very attentive and helpful. I would absolutely go the Kelly's on my next trip to Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "The environment is pretty laid back and chill. I could see going here for some after movie drinks for example, but I don't know if the horrible service is even worth it.   So we walk in and sit down, and our server comes up to our table and first off, asks us if we need a menu. Uh...yeah! So after like two minutes she comes back and asks us if we are ready to order. We ordered the mac n' cheese and a cheeseburger and two cokes. She looked at us really funny when we said we wanted cokes, and then told us that she would try but that the machine might not be working or something. I don't know, she wasn't making any sense.  So the mac n' cheese comes, but we had to wait for another 5 minutes for her to bring us a fork and the cheeseburger, which was kind of weird. As she brought out our food she said \"I'm not trying to offend you guys, but are you homos?\" I was like, in shock. Then one of us, I can't remember who because it seems like a blur, said something to the fact that we were indeed a couple. She said \"Ok that was cool, my co-worker and I were trying to figure it out. It's cool, I'm gay too. But if you were straight I might have had to kick you out hahaha!\" Seriously, I can't make this stuff up. Unreal. She then asked me if I wanted ketchup and other condiments for my cheeseburger and fries and I said yes, but she never came back with anything. At least we got the fork. My drink was empty for quite some time and she never bothered to ask me if I would like a refill.  The mac n' cheese had a good consistency and was really creamy, but it tasted like you were eating pure black pepper. The cheeseburger was decent for a cheeseburger with out condiments. The fries I didn't care for; they were really greasy and bland tasting.  She eventually came to take our plates and asked us if we \"wanted to chill for awhile\" or if we were ready to \"get the f- out.\" Again, at a loss for words, my fiancee says something like we would like to leave soon. She said that she was going to take a cigarette break and would be back.  Again, seriously. After another 15 minutes she finally came back and we left.  Most uncomfortable experience ever and I don't think we will ever be returning.",

(Do they still allow that!?) and listened to juke box music in the 50's style diner-esque booths with quiet conversation amongst friends.   Beyond the cool interior, Kelly's has good food, cheap happy hours and hasn't changed a bit. I miss my good ol' local spot.   Kelly's will always hold a special place in my heart.",

    "text": "I am a big fan of this place. It is kinda a dive bar and kinda a hipster hangout, but the best thing about it is that it has solid drinks and very solid food. They have great drink specials and they do a great job with all of their drinks... most of which I have never heard of. Some of the food is not great, but if you get the right things you will be really really happy.  I strongly recommend the mac and cheese, the Pittsburgh bites (chicken and get it spicy - it will make you want to drink more beers just like good bar food should!), the PLT (so simple and yet one of the best things I have had in the entire city), the meatloaf (the biggest surprise on the menu IMO), and the poutine (made with tater tots! and local Arsenal cheese curds!). Don't forget the daily drink with dinner.  All around, Kelly's is just a solid, solid place and a great place to hang out with friends.",

    "text": "Ah, Kelly's, your friendly neighborhood dive bar!  I've been here a few times and while I've always found myself satisfied with their libations, I can't really say it's all that memorable. Their happy hour menu is pretty satisfactory, with some of the best mac & cheese I've had in the city. Their beer selection, service, and ambiance are a bit..... how do you say? Meh.  Their food's not bad and they provide several vegetarian options for all the non-meat-eaters out there. Unfortunately, everything about it just seems sort of mediocre! Their tofu bites sounded a lot better than they actually were, with the spiciness overtaking the actual flavor. It was definitely something I could have made at home.  Granted, Kelly's has always seemed severely understaffed the times I've gone, so I can understand SOME of the slow service. I'm reminded of the surly hipster waitresses from the bars of my college days, ignoring tables for an eternity and forgetting refills and water. While the prices are decent, I certainly wouldn't mind paying a little bit more to have them beef up their waitstaff. It seems I can't leave Kelly's in under an hour due to how slow it is!  Worth a try during happy hour, but not quite worthy of being one of my regular drinking holes.",

I thought it was eating real Mac-n-cheese and about to be sick for days. I always go for a drink special because for $4, I'm going to get real drunk. Parking is not great, except during the winter when a little snow scares everyone away. I generally try to park behind the building (currently construction blocking those spots) or over by the library on Baum. I also love this bar because there is no smoking inside. Despite the fact I enjoy the smell of cigarettes, I hate when I smell like an ash tray. There is a smoke-friendly back patio.",

    "text": "First off, I need to break my rating down a bit...   The bar and the mac n' cheese get 5 stars.  Nothing better than the mac n' cheese here, I probably could eat a bucket full.  It is peppery, though, so if that ain't your thang then you've been warned.  Also, the quality of other food I've gotten here was better than your average bar food.  The bar has fantastic choices of drafts and the service is very good.    The patio in the back was a very nice surprise... I was at Kelly's several times before I even knew it existed.  Wonderful option...but this is where things go wrong.  The service at the tables and the patio is atrocious.  Actually it's laughable how rude the waitress was to our party (unprovoked!).  I was prepared for it after reading some reviews on here, but was startled by how much the warnings rang True.  I don't believe this is a matter of \"we didn't know somebody\" or \"we don't look hip enough\", I honestly just think they understaff their floor.  There was one waitress in charge of all inside and patio and she was obviously overwhelmed.    Next time I will stick to the bar (and the mac!).",

    "text": "I first heard about Kelly's mac and cheese so I had to try it, of course. I'm a huge black pepper fan, and the flavor is extremely prominent in this one so it really hit the spot. It comes out burning hot in a cast iron skillet, and for $6 you get a pretty good amount. I've also had their sweet potato fries and their tacos, both were pretty good. The tacos come with a large helping of sour cream, guacamole, and salsa - the sweet potato fries were more like thick chips. My only complaint was the sweet potato fries, while tasty, didn't seem fried very well - soggy and greasy.  Every night of the week they rotate through a list of $4 retro cocktails for the whole night. I had a presbyterian one night, and a rob roy another.  I also grabbed a white witch off the menu - very tasty, a lot of rum with a sweet aftertaste.  Overall an awesome place. Happy hour is 5-7pm, btw.",

    "text": "One of the most unique places in Pittsburgh has got to be Kelly's.  When you walk in, you could virtually be going back in time to the 50s with the bar along the wall, high-backed booths and odd but soothing pink lighting.  There's definitely an eclectic crowd that frequents Kelly's, I guess you can call it hipster, but that adds to the uniqueness of the bar.  You never know what kind of people you'll run into there.  I haven't ever eaten there, but the drinks are fairly priced, especially their $4 mixed drink specials.  I've never felt cheated on the amount of libations in their Gin Buck or Mojito.  When the bar area gets too crowded, you can also go to the back patio and order drinks from the waitresses on staff, who are usually pretty good.  It's a good bar with a different vibe worth checking out.",
