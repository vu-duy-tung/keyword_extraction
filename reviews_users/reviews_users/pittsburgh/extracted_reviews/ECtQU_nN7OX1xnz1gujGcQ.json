Me and my Hawaiian friend went there to grab what I heard was some great Indian food, during one of the \"Unblurred\" Friday evenings. The concierge looked at us disdainfully, and was talking about how the 3-4 empty tables we saw was reserved. No \"reserved\" signs were in sight on these tables and dude did not mention when any seating would be freed up.   Whether or not he was prick or or a racist prick, I have no idea. He seemed more interested in getting us out of there than he was in trying to serve us. It is Garfield, so may be he has had issues with the local denizens causing trouble, who happen to look like me. Dunno. All the white people get to eat, we do not?   With the exception of the Awesome Spak Brothers, I would not bother eating anything on Penn Avenue. Ever. I spend more time focusing on the surrounding crap than I do with actually eating.",

There was still fresh food on the buffet. They refilled while I was there. As a vegan I appreciate Indian food & had many options. Usually my gauge for any Indian place it the Chana masala, my favorite dish. I was super impressed with theirs. Perfectly steamed  chickpeas with right amount of spice & cilantro! A second favorite was the Aloo Pang which is spinach potatoes & spices. The nan was fresh & hot. Also, the service was great, I never once had to ask for water.   For my second experience with people's I decided to order take out. They do free delivery to the surrounding area! (I live in Stanton Heights) it came within an hour of calling & was freshly made. I had no complaints. I order Chana Masala, Aloo pang & nan....it was about $20, lasted me dinner & lunch the next day ! Plan to Order again soon",

I usually get either Baingan Bartha or Aloo Gobi, as well as a dal and a plain naan. The dals are confusing because there are three on the menu and they only really have two. I've tried to stop letting that perplex me, but I can never remember the one they don't have and often try to order it. Maybe my take out menu is outdated in that I should cross that one out. Ok, now on to important stuff...I order a spice level of 10 out of 10. The results are dynamite! Instead of using some cheap sauce or hot oil, I can see and taste that they use fresh chillies for added spice. They also use a ton of cilantro and delicious almost caramelized onions in the flavoring of the dishes. Each bite is a mouth explosion. And I love mouth explosions!   This restaurant has it's shortcomings, but since it's the only place in town that has satisfied the lust of my taste buds for hot oral pleasure, I am a big fan.",

I ordered it with a a friend at work and while the ordering process was fairly simple (grub-hub) and it arrived in a reasonable amount of time the quality of the meal was seriously below standard.   I love Indian food and one thing I love about it is the complexity of the flavors. This was flat, one note. A earlier review mentioned his tikka masala reminiscent of Campbells tomato soup - well add the butter chicken to that experience.   The chicken had that metallic like taste you get from microwaved meat which did compliment the bland taste of the food - hey, if nothing, they are consistent in how awful the meal was prepared.   Right now, I am sitting at my desk and my body is actively fighting indigestion. Yep, this place is terrible. 4 star average? Wow, that is shocking... of the countless Indian meals I have had this is by far the worst.  Update: 8 hours later and still feel sick from this meal. Ugh. Never again.",

I ordered two entrees (Aloob Ghobi and Aloo Saag) and naan baked w/ ground lamb.  With delivery, tax, and tip, it was nearly $35.  The entrees were in pint containers that were about 2/3rds full.  There was a pint container of basmati rice, which was cold.  I asked for a 6 spiciness - I like spicy food but this was just about at my threshold - a notch spicier and it would have been inedible.

I think that it is a possibility that my waitress was brand new.  She was having trouble listening to what I ordered.  I thought carefully about what I wanted tonight and ended up just going with the old favorite of chana masala with some vegetable samosa.  She said, \"is that the chicken tikka masala that you want?\"  I said, \"no I would like the chana masala which is chick peas and vegetables with sauce and spices.\"  After it was cooked she brought me the chana masala with no samosa.  So I said, \"where is the vegetable samosa?\"  To this she replied, \"you just ordered the chana masala\" and I said, \"no I also ordered that with some vegetable samosa.\"  She did end up correcting her mistake and apologizing after she brought the samosas.  As far as the chana masala goes it was just o.k. tonight.  It had a tangy sauce with some decent spices, but not as much of a thick tomato sauce as I have had at other Indian restaurants.  I thought the portion size was very good because I did not go away hungry, but it was also a bit on the salty side.   As an aside I think that I am a bit more picky when it comes to dishes.  I am sure this waitress will get the hang of things eventually I would hope.",

The fish in the curry was salmon, which was a little unusual and not quite as good as other fish you could curry, but I was also made aware of that when I ordered. For the price we both left very full. The waitstaff was very helpful. When I ordered a \"10\" on the spicy scale, he asked if I wanted \"American 10\" or \"Indian 10\". After finding out that \"American 10\" = \"Indian 5\", I was steered toward the \"Indian 7\" which really was perfect for me.

I have dined in plenty of times so I know how their usual 6 taste. So when I order it to go I thought it would be the same. Sadly mistaken, it was a 1. I called to let them know and to my suprise they didn't care. Nor did they even want to rectify this mistake. My advice to you for to go, try it before you leave because there may be no turning back.",

I won't go in to the particulars--I agree with some of the comments below--I will remind people that it's BYOB (I really think Indian food tastes so much better with a beer) so come prepared.    I would not call it life-alteringly-good Indian, but I've found much of the food to be flavorful and the service has always been friendly, if a bit slow at times.    Decor is typical--seems like a kid-friendly place and good for large groups as well.    Oh, and they're closed on Sundays, for which I'm happy for them, but I have to admit I would probably go more often if I could grab take-out on a cold sunday afternoon. . .

Tables are not huge but are neat. Staff is courteous and attentive. They serve complementary roasted papad with chutney.  We ordered paneer masala - yummy, dal makhani - awesomely awesome with lachcha parantha- I have had better lachcha parantha in past this one was okayish n onion naan- this was good.  Food was served without much wait, which was pleasing as we were hungary after the day's activities.  They serve jeera rice with the entree, which was also good. Overall Food tasted great.   We give them 5 stars based on 1 visit during a tourist visit to Pittsburgh; it proved a nice one.",

    "text": "I usually don't go to Indian restaurants because I find my own Indian cooking way better than any Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh (Yeah I'm snooty that way). But on this occasion, I was craving Indian food and was too tired to bother cooking. People's turned out to be a revelation.. even for the 'hard to please when it comes to Indian food' patron that I am. They had a variety of Chaats (a sweet, spicy and tangy appetizer). I tried the samosa chaat and loved it. Their menu is quite extensive. I was lost for choice at first (several vegetarian options) but went with the Bhindi Masala, Malai Kofta and the Garlic roti. The curries are not your standard creamy red sauces that you find in other restaurants but refreshingly flavorful. You can actually taste the tomatoes and the spices in the curry here as opposed to just one overwhelming flavor. I also tried some of my friend's paneer naan (bread stuffed with indian cheese) and definitely recommend it. For an Indian, I'm quite the spice-wuss.. so I picked a 6 on their hotness scale. It still ended up being a bit too hot for me. So if you're like me, and not a fan of hot, go lower than 6. They also have 8 different types of biriyani (a rice pot dish) which I didn't try on this trip but will definitely go back for. As stuffed as I was, I had to have a masala chai at the end of my meal and I'm very glad I did. It wasn't thick full fat milky chai that's usually served at Indian restaurant that usually is too much to handle for me but just the perfect end to a fabulous meal. I also must mention the gracious and friendly service. YAYYY such a surprise find! Definitely try it.",

I have only done take out, but the atmosphere is pleasant and the staff very friendly.  Preparation time was very fast so there is not a long wait if you haven't called in an order.  I was not exactly blown away by the chicken korma , my favorite dish and yardstick for Indian food, but the vegetarian version was very good. The nan is good, but the samosa was a bit over-cooked. The clincher for me is that they are the only place I have been able to find mango mousse, one of my favorite deserts.  It is thick and flavorful, and not like mango-flavored whipped cream that I have had in other places (not in PGH). It is worth trying this place at least once just for the mousse!",

We've noticed that it can take a little while to get served/food to arrive at the table if you dine in (assuming because of how busy their take out service is) so we tend to opt for take out. I am a vegetarian but my boyfriend is not, so People's is a great choice because of all the options for both of us. I have dreams about their vegetable shai korma, but have had nothing bad to say about any of their food. Spice levels are True to the number you pick and won't arrive unexpectedly hot.

They both looked old and one of them smelled old.  I decided to eat the chicken masala first since it was the only thing warm, and it was so bland, and unappealing that I decided I had to heat up the other 2 dishes to try and make up for it. Both of these dishes were extremely unappealing as well. I sadly had to throw most of it away. I always order indian food requesting a low spice number, but that has never accounted for loss of taste like this. I didn't even know you could go wrong with chicken marsala!

I also like that they offer a combination platter - which, realistically, is almost too much food for one person.  Service is quite fast - if I'm dining alone I can get in and out in under 30 minutes!",

Excellent seafood and vegetarian selections as well as drinks (love the mango shake) and several other entrees and apps. Business is always booming with take away and guests in the dining room. It's a no-brainer as to why they're a staple on Penn Avenue and why they're so successful. The food is always on point and always delicious; rice and naan cooked to perfection.

However, they are BYOB, which has led to many memorable special occasion dinners for us here. Do yourself a favor and get the Bagan Bharta, and then try any of their saag dishes. The naan is divine and comes out crisped and perfect every time. The best deal for dinner is the vegetarian meal platter, which offers 2 entree items, rice, naan, raita, dessert, tea and pickles.

They also serve beef and shrimp among their proteins (besides chicken and lamb) which are not as frequently seen at Indian restaurants so that provided some more variety in options as well.

To our surprise-  looking at the size of portion of two dishes which cost almost $24 was disappointing! There was literally 4 small pieces of chicken in  chicken makhany. Rice looked  dry and hard. Both dishes smelled a little wierd to my wife.  I did not care, I was hungry. I ate. She followed , seeing me.  We said to keep spice level medium. The spice level was way too hot for guys who actually eats a lot of spice. So, thank God, we did not feed to our 3 year old!  Half an hour after eating the Biriyani, my stomach started to cramp, and here we go- stomach flu.  Both of us started to have the same lower  stomach pain and loose motion last night.  It has been almost 20 hours. Both of us still having stomach pain, discomfort.   Not sure what's going on with this restaurant! This was the first time I went to this restaurant.  I talked to few friends about the incident. It seems they are newly opened. And none of my desi community friends went to this place before.  So enter at your own risk. :(",

Also, aside from the quality of food, the staff is always very kind and the restaurant is always clean. And the price of the lunch buffet is awesome.

This spot was filled with couples for Saturday evening date night.   And it's not hard to see why. It's quiet, unassuming, quality food at an affordable price.   The service was attentive, and we didn't feel rushed to leave. A couple next to us brought their own wine; so it's BYOB (unsure about a corking fee).   I ordered Chana Marsala; it was good but I didn't like the tomato in it... I've never had Chana with tomato like that and it threw me. Personal preference I'm sure , next time I'll order it sans tomato . My dinner partner ordered Chicken Chat, spice level 6-- it looked good but I couldn't try it because I'm a spice level 0.

I enjoyed the vegetable pakoras as an appetizer. The samosa chaat was ok--not as spicy as I'm used to but still tasty. I also tried the chicken vindaloo, a generally spicy and tangy tomato based dish. If you like spicy, the vindaloo is a solid choice. The star for me was the garlic naan. It's so buttery and delicious and serves its purpose--to sop up all the extra sauce--well. I'll be back to try more and will update my review as I do!",

The food is fresh and delicious, and the servers are super nice.   I really wanted a mango drink so I decided to try the Mango Lassi. It was refreshing and creamy, and tasted wonderful. It kind of reminded me of a mango smoothie. For our appetizers, my sister and I shared the People's vegetarian sampler which our server recommended. Great choice, because everything on it was excellent! There were 2 samosas, 2 vegetable pakoras, and 2 aloo tiki. The aloo tiki and samosas were the best in my opinion, they were soft and pillowy and had a nice crisp to them. The pakoras were good too. For my entree, I had palak paneer with lamb. Palak paneer is one of my go to Indian dishes because it is creamy and warms me up on a cold day. The paneer was fresh and tasted great!   Overall, I would highly recommend you try People's if you want authentic Indian food that tastes amazing. I have all positive things to say about it!",

I was craving Chana masala, which I've only had at Tupelo Honey Teas and theirs is delicious. Since it was 7pm and I was doing UberEats, I figured I'd try some from an Indian restaurant. A+ decision, as I thoroughly enjoyed my order from People's Indian Restaurant.  I ordered the Chana masala with extra sauce, and an order of vegetable samosas. I'd had samosas once before and enjoyed them; these were much more heavily spiced but they were delicious and huge. The Chana masala was perfect; the spice level was exactly what I expected as well. They didn't just put a bit of extra sauce in the order, they gave a second container of sauce! Definitely bookmarked this place for future Chana masala cravings, and to try some new dishes to expand my Indian fare palate.",

We arrived on a Saturday for the lunch buffet around 12 and went straight to a table and grabbed plates. Huge disclaimer: LUNCH BUFFET IS $8.45. Yes you heard me $8.45.   To be honest I tried a bit of everything and can't really remember what it all was, but everything (except this one spinach dish) was really tasty. I really appreciated the fresh fruit also, but I did feel like when they ran out, they didn't plan on bringing more out. I took the last scoop of fruit and 10 mins later went back hoping there would be more, but there wasn't. Probably on me to ask and I didn't though.   I will absolutely be back",

I recommend them above all other Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh.  For dine-in, I had a nice time here the one time I stopped in. The windows let in a ton of light and the atmosphere is very warm and pleasant. The buffet main dish food is extremely bland - definitely the least flavorful Indian food I've ever had, and I've eaten a lot of Indian food. The textures also leave a lot to be desired. A striking contrast to ordering off their menu. It was definitely a mistake to mess with the buffet, but it was the thing customers there were up to. What's great eating here is the atmosphere and the location. Order off the menu.",

Very disappointing being Indian food that is watered down and not spicy. I was expecting better given the other reviews. Overall I've had way better and there are plenty of other good options close by that are better than this place.",

I'd also recommend the buffet, which is quite extensive and a good value if you're really hungry or want to sample a little of everything. Service is always friendly, attentive, and efficient.

I got chicken vindaloo for my husband and aloo mattar for myself (and garlic naan, of course, because I'm pretty sure it's against the law to eat Indian food without naan). Because we were both recently recovering from the stomach flu (and I had no idea how their spice scale is calibrated), I went easy on the heat and ordered each at a level 4.  The verdict? Sadly, kinda meh. The sauces in both dishes had textural issues...the aloo mattar sauce wasn't as creamy as I'd prefer, and the vindaloo sauce was a little watery. And the biggest bummer was that both dishes were pretty bland. One of the main reasons that I love Indian food so much is because of the spices...and I'm not just talking about heat, but the multi-dimensional, warm, aromatic, earthy flavors that this cuisine is known for. Unfortunately, the flavors fell pretty flat in both dishes. On the positive side, the chicken in the vindaloo was very tender and cooked perfectly, as were the potatoes in the aloo mattar.   Overall, while the meal wasn't terrible, it isn't Indian food that I'd go out of my way to get again.",

The menu has a wide variety of options, some classic, some more obscure. I was feeling like paneer makhani (butter paneer). I ordered that and we had garlic naan to share. I also ordered a salty lassi.  The paneer was great, and they give a very generous amount of both paneer and rice with the dish (other places can really skimp on paneer, but not here). I ordered a 7, which is my go-to for places that scale 1-10. It was a little hotter than I was expecting, so maybe adjust your expectations. The garlic naan was also delicious. The salty lassi left a bit to be desired - I'm used to more cumin/general spice.  Reasonable price, attentive service, and good food! I'll be back to check out the lunch buffet for sure.",

You can just hang out with some friends enjoy the great food. I like going during the lunch time buffet but we were there for dinner so I was not able to sample as much of the dishes as I would have liked. Still we did pretty good.   Appetizers:  Paneer Pakora: Homemade cheese chunks deep fried. Of course this is my go to appetizer at any Indian restaurant. I will say that here I did not get as many of the pakora chunks as some of the other places I have ordered this from, but still they were good.   2 piece Vegetable Samosa: I think that the name suggests it all. There were two crispy turnovers filled with potatoes and peas. Yum. Just the right size. The three of us were able to eat these and they filled us up really nicely.   Vegetable Pakora: Fritters stuffed with vegetables. These were fantastic. Fried perfection. The sauce that it came with was also really good. I enjoyed these more than my favorite dish of the paneer pakora. YUM. Would get this again if I had to pick only one appy.   Main dish:   Ok, I am a little bit of a glutton but I like a good deal. I am trying to find on their online menu what the dish that I ordered was called but I cannot find it listed at all. It is the best deal on the entire menu. You get a chicken or a lamb curry dish, a yogurt dish, a pickle dish, a piece of tandoori chicken, a dessert, and some naan. OH WAIT. You also get a cup of chai tea. It is the best deal on the menu. You can also get this in a veggie dish so you do not have to get meat. It is about the same price as just the curry. Why would you not just for a few dollars more get this with all the extras!!  I liked it here. I had a great time and the food was wonderful. I suggest coming here for a nice dinner or lunch alone or with friends.",

The service is also great. Just took off one star for the naan- it was a little burnt each time I came here.",

The restaurant isn't clean, sometimes they take awhile to refill the steam trays, and it's kind of loud.  But it's cheap and decent.  Best way to fill yourself up on a cold day on the east end.",

    "text": "Hadn't been here in a few years and remembered I enjoyed it in undergrad, especially for late night half off. Called in advance to make sure they were open until 10 and had half off like they used to. The woman who answered the phone said yes to both so I rushed over. The portions were small, but I assumed it was because it was half price so I shrugged it off. The tomato sauce was chunky and generic, the raita side dish was 4 spoonfuls big, and the chutney dips were cold and bland. Assuming this was due to the discount, I didn't complain. Receive my check to find out it was all full price. Despite the woman telling me on the phone that it was half off, it was buy one get one half off. The woman on the phone was the same as the hostess. She admitted it was she who answered yet refused to accommodate her mistake. I don't normally feel compelled to complain but that is ridiculous. A subpar meal and subpar service in addition to False marketing. Never going back despite the fond memories I had accumulated when in school. Completely ridiculous.",

    "text": "People's Indian is a solid traditional Indian place. Offerings are standard, but well done. I like their bindi masala and vegetable korma. In meat offerings, their lamb is really quite good.  Their lunch buffet has a solid selection of both meat and vegetable dishes and includes samosas, which not all buffets do. Also included is chai, which is good (if overly sweet).  In general, it's one of the better local Indian places. The service is also pretty consistent and pleasant (unlike, say, India Garden where the service is consistently horrific).",
