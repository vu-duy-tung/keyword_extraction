We were sitting at the uncrowded bar at least 5 min, staff never came over.   The girls were busy talking amongst themselves and were more involved with doing busy work than waiting on customers.    After we called out to them to order a drink, they never checked back after a bit for another one.  They were too busy talking and putting on lip gloss!  Since they are newly open, will give another chance, but they need to have a seasoned bar staff if they want to keep customers.",

I highly recommend RumFish, but the prices are a little escalated, but it is the atmosphere that helps with the price challenge.",

Anyhow, there are no longer the different size pours for wine and the central menu item is now a \"build your own dinner\" idea.  It definitely works, provided you know how to pair fish or meat with sauce and sides.  I've done two different versions (both fish) and they've been pretty freaking fantastic.  The kitchen knows how to cook fish!  Also new since they opened is a HUGE outdoor space, complete with stage area and water features.  Haven't been outside to take advantage yet as it's been PACKED both times I've been since that opened.  Speaking of packed, with the outdoor space, the place is PACKED every evening... Parking can be kinda interesting in the small lot.  All in all, a great addition to the South Hills dining scene.",

The sashimi was fresh and was made to order right in front of us.  The oysters were also shucked right in front of us.  We were just passing through and did not stay for dinner.  Everything coming out of the kitchen looked good.  The new outside area was open and looked like a lot of fun.  The owners brought your favorite beach restaurant to Pittsburgh.  I can't wait to get a babysitter and bring my wife out to this place for the evening.  The kind of place you can eat a good dinner and stay the night for drinks and entertainment. Great job with the design and menu.  I'm just jealous I don't live closer to Bridgeville. ;(",

Food was not great- my fish sandwich was served on slightly stale, cold ciabatta bread with a side of underripe honeydew melon. For the price they could at least have decent bread for a fish sandwich!  Server was also creepy- would not leave us alone though we sent a clear vibe that we were ok as is. Asked us our names, where we were from etc etc. Came by the table no less than 8 times. I know he wasn't busy but For god sakes, leave us alone so we can eat and talk in peace. Won't be back- too many other decent places nearby- will just go to walnut grille instead!",

I don't know if that is a permanent status or just because we are finally getting rid of winter.  They asked if we wanted to sit outside and with the weather clearing of course we said yes.  What we didn't know was that our seats would still be wet so we all ended up with wet bums.  I ordered the shrimp boil as an appetizer, which being called a boil you would think it would be warm, but no it was cold.   Next I ordered the fish of the day and asked for it blackened.  Well, I guess that was a mistake because I received the driest piece of fish that I ever had before.  I told the waitress and she immediately took the meai of the check.  I really believe this place is more concerned with providing entertainment on their beach and being a bar than being a good restaurant.",

When I did return, it was a night and day difference. Took the greasy Kennywood food off the menu and replaced it with healthier and high quality choices. AND started carrying the tequila I so love. My husband and I love Rumfish. Love everything about it. We seem to find ourselves there at least three times a week  The pork is to die for! Lamb shank is amazing. Whipped potatoes taste better than mom's. Ribeye for two is huge and intimidating but every bite is better than the last. Salmon is superb.  I could go on, but you need to check them out for yourself.    If you are someone who visited them early on and didn't like it, you need to go back. They've done a 360 and you've got to revisit them.  And now that the outside areas are mostly done, it's been the spot to see and be seen.",

    "text": "I'm a bit of a hypocrite.  I love good food.  I love good fish.  This restaurant has fabulous fish.  I'm rating it 4 stars because there is so much to like about this restaurant.  I'm a hypocrite because it is unlikely I will visit often.  And as in all reviews it is a matter more of personal taste and less of objectivity on quality, because the quality is certainly there.  The good:  This restaurant knows it's fish.  The restaurant itself is beautiful in a very urban chic style.  More bars than I can count, an unusually large outdoor multiple bar area with couches, fire pits, open air pig roasting and a stage.  This is an environment I would expect in Phoenix or Atlanta, yet it is here in Bridgeville.  Indoors, modern decor, garage doors that open multiple walls to the outside, more  bars, raw bar (oysters, sashimi), open kitchen, and clean bathrooms with nice soap.  (yes, the quality of the soap does qualify for a review)  The menu is multiple choice:  you pick your fish, your sauce and your side.  They have a kids menu with a house mac and cheese.  M&C is also a side on the adult menu and is very very good..  (see my review on Sauce for my local obsession with mac and cheese)  We ordered shark and the west coast fish of the day.  THICK pieces of fish cooked a little rare in the center the way I like it.  Very fresh tasting and proportioned appropriately  Asparagus, mashed potatoes competent.  The medium (which is mostly good):  The atmosphere is social.  They have about seven bars between the inside and the outside.  The clientele starts older and moves younger as the hours get later.  I'm old.  so read me with a grain of salt, but when I lived in Atlanta and was much younger, I truly enjoyed a venue such as this and am glad we have one here.  My impression:  it's a great place to go after work, almost everyone appeared to be professional, it's a great place to meet age appropriate divorced people and a great place to take someone you met on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmatch.com&s=5a7ad17eb3943c81dac85ae79b9c0c050694769f0de09ef7d94e7ed56fd99c4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">match.com</a>.  This restaurant/bar really has a lot to offer in the social arena and If I were single I would absolutely take advantage of it.  While I haven't experienced the later night, the stage indicates it's likely a lot of fun.  The bad:  The waitress knew nothing about fish other than the required pre-briefings.  example conversation:  what is the shark?  answer:  It's a meaty fish.  Q:  What is the west coast fish?  A:  It's a meaty fish.   Q:  have you tasted any of the menu?  A:  no.    Q:  what is the rum sauce?  A:  its a spicy mayonnaise based sauce best used on meaty fish.  Q:  what is the aioli?  A:  It's a mayonnaise based sauce best used on meaty fish.  Yeah... not helpful.  In fact most sauces here are modified tartar sauce...... in other words mayonnaise based.  So if you, like me wanted a rum sauce with actual rum that was an actual sauce, you are out of luck.  It wasn't horrible, it was mayonnaise with red pepper.    The aioli was mayonnaise with spices.  You get it.   Best leave your kids at home because this is a fun place - especially if you are of the age to have kids but still like to go out, have some drink, good food but not want to go deaf or deal with the college set during dinner.   For the young singles, later is a fabulous first date to impress and when the outside is open with a band....",

The other day friends wanted to meet so we met there and gave them a second chance, thinking that well, they've been open for a while now. Maybe they straightened out their chef and kitchen. Nope. My husband got fish and said it so greasy, he couldn't eat it. I got the jambalaya with clams & mussels, and, it said, with red skin potatoes, but came with none. It basically was a bowl of mushy broth with bread on the side, with a bunch of EMPTY shells!! No meat in any of the shells. It tasted HORRIBLE!!

Well, anything beyond the venue would have been nice.  When I arrived at the outdoor stage, I looked at the menu and ordered a Dogfish Head 90 minute.  The bartender said that she has never heard of it.  She asked her coworker, and he had never heard of a 90 minute either.   I pointed to the beer listed on the menu, and they said \"Oh, you can't get that out here.  It's only cans.\"   They seemed to be surprised that I didn't know that I couldn't order a bottle outside, despite them having given me a full menu outside.  Fine, so I ordered a Torpedo can.   They said that they're out of it.   OK.  Guinness is also on the cans menu, so I ordered that.  They said that they don't think that they have it.  She asked the other guy, and he said that he'd look.  They finally found one.  Now it's food time.  We tried to order the crab dip.   They said that the only thing that you can order outside is chips. You're not allowed to have any other food outside.  Again, they seemed to be surprised that we didn't just know this, despite being provided with a food menu outside.  Oddly, we saw some guy with a burger at some point.  Apparently they have a burger and hot dog place, And maybe if you grease the right palms, you can take your burger to the other part of the outside.  Or something.  We wanted real food, so we relocated to the inside bar.   We got crab dip, and it was perhaps the worst I've ever had.  You could do better with a plastic tub of anything from any grocery store.  It was some runny cheese, with some crab flavor.  Maybe a few shreds of crab scrap were in there, but it was hard to tell.    I ordered a dark and stormy.  It ended up being mostly sour mix.  I can only assume that they've never heard of a Dark and Stormy before, so they were just winging it.  We needed some more food, so we got some sushi.  I asked how many pieces came with a nigiri order, and our server had no clue.  Apparently it's two pieces.  When it came, the sushi was actually quite good.  But everything else about the place was bad enough that I can't give it more than one star.    The staff was distracted and oblivious about anything on the menu or what they had going on there.   The layout and operation of the place was clearly not something that had the customers in mind.  The whole operation was unprofessional and disrespectful.  The only reason I came here was for my friend whose band was  playing.  I might come back for him, but not for anything else.",

I ordered what was supposed to be blackened chicken on firecracker wrap don't know if the chix was blackened because I really couldn't find any was just lettuce and mango chopped up on a dry tortilla that was red.  My brother ordered $20 dollar fish&chips which was 2 medium size pieces of fish and some soggy fries. Don't waste your time or money.

    "text": "It was my first time here tonight and it was packed on a Wednesday so it obviously isn't too bad. If you ask me, it was the food that brought people back-- not the service.  We got there about 25 minutes until 7. Happy hour ends at 7. We had reservations so we were seated as soon as we got here. Our waitress took her little time coming to take our orders. We wanted to get at least one round of drinks and appetizers at happy hour prices because the deals are great! She came to take our order 25 minutes later... Right when happy hour ended.   Drinks took about ten minutes but they were great. I'm a fan of Moscow mules and it was one of the best I've had. My dad and his girlfriend got mixed drinks and loved them too. My boyfriend got an IPA because he's picky about his old fashioneds.  The crab dip tasted like tuna to me. Not a big fan at all. I ordered the salmon, creamy polenta, and green beans. I actually really dislike any fish that isn't shellfish but the salmon only had a tiny hint of fishiness. You also got a dipping sauce for your fish. I got the chimichurri. My boyfriend had the tiger fish, polenta and asparagus with ponzu sauce. He loved his meal but we ended up switching sauces. All in all, the food was good- lacking in some areas but THE SERVICE IS ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY 110% AWFUL.   Our waitress passed by us so many times when we needed more water, more drinks, or wanted to put in another appetizer order. I work in the service industry and I felt embarrassed for the management staff by how awful our waitress was to is and surrounding tables. They should consider taking on some more staff or teach their new staff how to cover all your tables in an efficient manner. All the tables around us had complaints about the service from what we could over hear.",

One weeknight we had just exercised at the nearby LA Fitness and wanted to try someplace different for dinner. It was a weeknight and we thought it wouldn't be too busy. We were not sorry for our decision.   The first thing I should mention was that we went on an unusually warm spring evening. Their patio was open and I have to say that you need to check this place out. We were surrounded by sand and waterfalls.  There were several firepits and couch style seating. They really make you feel as though you're on vacation.   I should mention that the service was very good. The food was also wonderful with enough selections from both the land and the sea to keep us both happy. The only downside was the the prices are a bit high, but the quality and atmosphere are worth it for special occasions,  like when the sun goes down.",

A friend and I were in the mood for some brunch (and of course cocktails) and we knew exactly where to go for good quality and friendly service. This place is definitely a hole in the wall; a very clean, friendly, inviting, and fun-filled atmospheric hole in the wall. You can definitely expect a different kind of atmosphere for each meal-time of the day.   I ordered a spicy bloody mary and the Po'boy shimp sandwich. Both were PERFECT! The bloody mary was spicy, but not overpowering and just the right amount of salty. The Po'boy was fresh, shrimp was cooked to perfection and soft. Definitely adding this to my favorite meals. Our waiter was friendly and on-point with his service.   Brunch is generally quiet, but fast service and you will definitely be taken care of right away. Lunch is average, but not too packed. Dinner is where the action is at. The open area outside is always lively with live music (in the summer), fire pits, waterfalls, and a very well stocked bar.   I would definitely recommend their Dark and Stormy mixed drink. It's ginger beer, lime, spiced rum. Out of this world delicious.   Great food! 10/10 Fast, friendly service 10/10 Atmosphere 10/10 Cocktails? OH heck yes 10/10",

They do do a good job of emanating a \"beach club\" feel even though the place is in Bridgeville, Pennsylvania. But other than that everything else is just kind of mediocre to blah.   The last time I went I was meeting my sister-in-law and some of her friends for drinks and dinner. We had to wait for a table, so we got a few drinks from the outside bar and sat at one of the couches. It was already very busy so we were lucky. It took awhile to get seated. We were quoted a 20 minute wait, but it ended up being closer to 40 minutes.  After we were seated we waited awhile at the table before our waiter came over. He brought us water and asked one person we were with what she'd like to drink. She said she was just fine with water. He quickly looked around the table and said, \"You're all good with water? Okay good. Be back in a little.\" He didn't really give anyone any time to actually order another drink. I was going to order the wine, but had to wait until he came back.   We sat again and looked at the menu for another 5-10 minutes. Our waiter came back and quickly took our orders. I ordered my wine and the Shrimp Po' Boy. The food did come out really fast. And it was decent. The Shrimp Po' Boy was pretty straightforward. The fries were actually really good. Everyone else liked their food. I think other people at the table got the Crab Cake Sandwich and the Chicken Sandwich. It was disappointing though that while we were eating the waiter didn't check in or anything. He just came back when our plates were clean with the check. It just surprised me that a restaurant that advertises itself as somewhat higher scale has service equivalent to what you'd find in a diner. I get that they're busy, but at least try to check in and see if our food is okay.  After we ate and paid we went back out to the outside bar area, which by this point was pretty packed. We had to stand since all the couches were occupied. We got a few more drinks and people-watched. The outside bar area is unfortunately pretty obnoxious. It was a club atmosphere but a relatively middle-aged crowd. It actually seemed like there were quite a few mid-life crisis middle-aged men hitting on women in their early 20s. It felt a little like Southside minus the college. Some people might be into that, but that atmosphere wasn't really for me.  It might have been really nice on a more chill night, but with it being that crowded and loud (a DJ was blaring club music) we decided not to stay too long.   In summary - food is decent, the atmosphere is cool and might have been cooler if it had been more relaxed that particular Friday I went, the club feeling it had though was lame and annoying, and the service is pretty shoddy. I'm not going to tell you not to go here. But it's definitely not anything amazing.",

We struggled to find our server for long periods of time and when located she was less than friendly.   When the food finally arrived an hour after arriving, it was lukewarm and tasteless. Requests for condiments were ignored. In the end we had to ask the hostess for our check since our waitress vanished.   The decor is nice, but unless you plan to just get drinks, I recommend going elsewhere.",

After that, it all went down hill. Our waitress was inattentive and we had to ask for refills on water and forks for dessert.  The salad came our with more rust then green on the leaves. The flat iron steaks were cold in the center, and bright red. They were almost 2 inches thick, so hard to get cooked perfectly. My son had the sea bass and it was gummy in the middle, definitely undercooked. The NY strip had no flavor (but the onion rings were good!). There was not one meal on our $230 bill that was decent. The one thing the place had going for it was its appetizers. They did give us $50 is gift certificate for food only, guess we will get appetizers.",

But we had dinner, crab cakes and a strip steak.. both really good.   They changed their menu a little and the only complaint is they don't have sauteed mushrooms for the 3 steak varieties they now offer. Live band playing soft music was a nice touch. Regardless, we will certainly be back.",

But the lack of service, especially on a Tuesday night that was mostly dead, everyone seemed disinterested. Took for ever to get served at the bar and the raw bar was nonexistent. I was set on seafood for the evening, so I stayed hoping that it would get better.   I ordered chicken egg roll apps and blackened mahi mahi. The buffalo chicken egg rolls were good but could have done without the cucumber sauce, (KISS--ranch or blue cheese.) I hate to say the service hasn't gotten better.  It has been over an hour and still no entree and I'm a party of ONE!!!  They keep saying my food is coming but at this point I'm not sure I want it.   FINALLY, it arrives. The fish is prepared well and Mac and cheese is really good. The Brussels Sprouts are fair at best. All and all a good meal but not worth the wait.   Food was 4 star but service was 2 star. Better luck next time.",

Based on our waitresses recommendations, the wedge salad was just ok (the bacon was too hard, skimpy on the egg and blue cheese) and the chicken florentine sandwich wasn't that good. The Alfredo sauce seemed wrong. Our drinks were fine.   The atmosphere was very cool, nice outdoor seating - waterfalls and fire pits - very relaxing. We will come back and try again with some fish dishes next time and probably NOT take the wait staff recommendations- ours seemed a little spaced out.",

The waiter was nice and served everyone very well and the food was okay. The architecture, atmosphere, and great outdoor space is definitely something you don't get around this area and serves as a great place to hang out with the family or friends. I ordered the Rumfish Wrap with grilled chicken and it also came with fries. It was good and the flavor was there, but it wasn't anything special nor did it have a wow factor. Quite frankly, I've had better wraps from Chipotle. I would rate this place as a 4-star because of the restaurant's great building and outdoor space, however because of the mediocre food I had brought it down to a 3-star. Don't let that turn you off, this place is definitely a try and I will come back sometime in the future.",

However, Rumfish Grille was so bad that it inspired me to sign up for Yelp and begin writing reviews.   The bartender must have forgotten to pour booze into our $9 cocktails to start the night. No problem - we can switch to IPA's. Except somehow both the bartender and waitress didn't notice that the beers were lukewarm. Maybe we would have had a chance to switch them had our waitress been around at all. She liked to hide.   Eh. It's okay. This $36 dish I ordered will surely make up for it. I should have taken a picture of this dish. For upwards of $36, they must have put about $3 into the plate. The chicken breast was maybe 3 oz.   The only redeeming quality of this place is the outside tiki area. Even then, if I want to spend $5 on an IC light I can gladly go to south side.   Avoid Rumfish unless you're a middle aged showboat who isn't practical enough to just save money and go to a real beach.",

( Can't wait to come back here to sit out back) ....    The interior is nice as well.   Service was great...   The food was really good.   I selected a 'Create your own' option, in which you pick a protein ( Mahi Mahi, Crab cakes, Chicken breasts, Tuna, Salmon, Lobster tail, Shrimp and more... ) and then two sides ( Fries, mac n cheese, south African rice, whipped potatoes, veggies...etc)... and then a sauce ( chimichurri, asian ginger scallion, tartar, roasted garlic aioli, red pepper cream are just a few examples)... I went with Chicken/ African Rice/ Zucchini and Au poivre... I didn't even need the sauce... it was delicious without.   The friends who brought me here stated they come here often, and as I am on a project off and on that will bring to me the area, I will for sure be back and I can't wait to try something new .",

I told the waiter and he brought another veal serving that was also 70% fat. Service was prompt until I complained about the veal. After that we had to ask 3 times for a water refill and had no one return to the table to inquire as to how our meal was. Ended up being an over priced and under appetizing meal.",

For a couple years they had a mixed grill on the menu, then they got rid of it. They had all you can eat crab legs every Thursday. Then without word, they got rid of it. Every time there's something worthwhile on this menu, they get rid of it and what's left is mediocre at best. Twice now my food has been cold after taking 30 minutes to come. Add all that to the $9 drinks and the fact that happy hour and drink specials are only available with bar seating makes this whole place not worth it. The waitress didn't know what beer was on tap. She didn't know what the dinner specials were. She couldn't tell us what fish pair with which sauce. Every time she had to go and ask and was gone for 10+ minutes. Never asked how the food was.

I can't wait until the outside is open, it will truly be amazing once that gets open.    I do feel the menu needs some work.  More salad options would be nice for someone like me that doesn't really eat meat or seafood.  I did get the pork and it was wonderful.  I did an up charge for the risotto and was HIGHLY disappointed, it lacked a lot of flavor and was under cooked.  I would have been better off not paying the extra $2.00 and getting the whipped potatoes instead.  Prices are high for the area and I hope the food selection gets better and more refined or else the place is in trouble when it comes to the food.  People will for sure be there to drink when the outside is finished.  Lets just hope the place is still in business by the time that happens.",

    "text": "We had out of town guests and I wanted them to experience Rumfish.  We had other local choices, like Bonefish or Walnut Grille but our guests looked at the Rumfish menu on line and decided this is where they wanted to go.  We were seated in a dining room at about 6:40.  Shortly after that their \"Game Night\" started and from that point on, we were unable to hear the waitress, and she could not hear us.  We could not even speak to each other.  It was loud, like a concert-very loud!  We had to sit and eat and we're forced to listen to the loud game and emcee with his microphone.  Needless to say, it was a carnival ERatmosphere and I could not have a conversation with our guests.  I screamed at the waitress \"WE CANT HEAR YOU\".  She said, \"ya I know, sorry\".  The manager stopped by to ask about our meal and I had to scream \"OUR FOOD IS GOOD BUT WE CANT HEAR EACH OTHER\".  ER She said she would have them turn it down, but it wasn't enough to help.  The bill was $125, and we tipped our waitress $25.  We left disappointed and I apologized to our guests.  I have called the restaurant 3 times.  Once I got a recording and left a message for the manager Bree to call me.  Hasn't happened yet.  I called later and a bartender offered to help if possible, but I said I wanted to speak to the manager.  She was due in at 3 pm.  I called at 4 pm and was told she was too busy to come to the phone.  I left my name and number.  I haven't heard from her yet.  I'm not a prude and I like loud music, but this lousy game night, obviously done to draw business on a slow Tuesday night, was obnoxious and loud and ruined our dining experience.  The bar seemed to clear out as well.  We were seated in a dining room, but that didn't separate us from the noise.",

The strange thing is there a party planner you are referred to to plan the whole party, but the restaurant was not on board or knew the things she was telling me. When I called the restaurant, the girls told me the outside area was free and first come, first serve. There was some open areas so wish I knew I could have come early and held a spot. We did order food outside, but the whole party could have ordered from the grill and had a space for $250 less. In my opinion, it would have been worth coming early to save that much money. Then I was told we had to spend $250 in addition for apps and drinks for our three hour window. The waitress did separate checks for us and never mentioned anything about this. They also told us we needed a list of guests attending for the door guys so our guests wouldn't be charged a cover fee at night. The night guys knew nothing of this? Again, no communication between the restaurant and the party planner. In the end, the outside area was beautiful, drinks were good and our waitress was great!! I just feel with all the money we spent at the restaurant in food and drinks and the business we brought, there shouldn't be a $250 cost for this. Again, if you want to charge this to people, I should have been told I could come early to hold an area and order food from the outside area.",

Without bread or a salad they ought to be more generous with the sides since fish isn't filling. For 50 bucks I want to leave stuffed. Good thing Sonic is down the street.

The server came back and he said they ran out of cod and substituted catfish, I think it was bad fish. The surf and turf is a sandwich, it was fatty beef on a soggy roll. It should have been enough warning when only four tables were occupied at the peek of lunch time.",

    "text": "Came here with a friend for dinner on a Wednesday night.  Place was mostly empty.  The raw bar area was closed and empty. I think they are struggling, which given its location at the back corner of a strip mall, isn't a surprise.  The decor is attractively modern and upscale looking. The feeling that they aren't doing well continued as the service was slow but friendly.  I sensed they are understaffed right now.  It may improve once the weather improves. ?..they have a glass garage door that swings up to provide outdoor dining in warmer months.  That looks like that would be nice.  They didn't have any NA beer....until after we ordered.  The server came back 5  minutes later and announced they had something,  but I had decided to stick with water by that point.  My friend had mahi mahi  and I chose wooloo, (sp?) a Hawaiian fish I had never tried.   Both were outstanding. Very flavorful, cooked without dryness,  and a good portion.  We thought a nice touch was the care  taken with the sides (you choose your own).   The roasted cauliflower was really good, as were the rosemary red potatoes, and my friend enjoyed her roasted root veggies and quinoa. Most places treat sides as an afterthought.  Not here.   We passed on dessert, and there were only 3 choices anyway..... The pricing is high,  as others mentioned, I think because of its location in a strip mall that features Bottom Dollar and TJ Maxx.  I think this place would have no trouble getting $20+ an entree in Mt Lebanon or around South Park Mall.   Would I go back?   Probably would in the warmer months...if it's still there.",

I checked my account on line as I always do and seen that the cost of my bill plus the tip that I had left had been taken out of my account, although now there was another transaction for the original amount of my drinks taken from my bank account. I called the moment I seen it and asked to speak with a manager, which apparently there was not one there. I called the next day to speak with a manager who said he would call the account manager and figure out the issue of why it was happening and also call me back but that it \"happens all the time.\" Like seriously?! Never called me back so of course I had to call him back and he was completely RUDE. He claimed to have left a message on my voicemail (I had my phone on me the entire time waiting for him to call back) which is obviously a lie. Not to mention he also said that he gets calls like this every week and never even apologized... What a shitty place with shitty managers that obviously don't know how to treat customers. If you get calls every week that your double charging people than maybe it's time to do something about it! I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy!",

We all ordered apps/dinner/dessert. They had a special, if you got an appetizer and dessert it would be 10$ extra. We waited FOREVER for the appetizers, FOREVER for our dinners, not to mention the waitress forgot to bring me my alcoholic beverage for about 45 minutes, which she made sure to tell me was much more expensive. It's ok though, it's a holiday, and she must be flustered, but there was NO APOLOGY. So after waiting another 40 minutes for the waitress, she comes up to tell us that none of our desserts are available. We call the manager over, he is a complete passive jerk. How that man runs a restaurant with his attitude is beyond me. It's not about holding the 10$ charge, it's about your service. With no smile, no remorse, he said \" what I'm doing for you is beyond fair\" no one was even arguing with him. The waitress then took another 20 minutes to cut our checks. Needless to say we left the restaurant at 9:30. This place is totally not worth the money.",

The policy here is to serve inside people first, thus you wait and wait.  I ordered a dessert.  Apparently, you cannot order that outside but the waitress said she could do it.  So, wait and wait.  She comes over to our area many times for new drink orders. I ask how hard could it be to cut a brownie? Please make sure the ice cream hasn't melted. After 50 minutes I am handed a box.  Inside is a cake like dessert with marshmallow seared on top.  I immediately walk it over to waitress. She insists that is what I ordered.  When I say no, she continues to say I ordered it.  So I walk away and figure I'll try it. It is HORRIBLE!, I let my husband try it and he doesn't like it at all. So $10.00 wasted.  Overpriced, bad atttitude and not a good taste. This really left a bad taste in my mouth!, Can't reccomend rumfish for eating while listening to music.  They are not earning customer goodwill by their policies.",

I ordered fried shrimp, Mexican street corn and brussel sprouts. The brussel sprouts was the best of what I had. Shrimp had a very soggy batter. Slide off the shrimp.

    "text": "I took my parents to Rumfish last night for their last night visiting from St. Louis. I had been so excited to try Rumfish for months, despite the fact that I heard very mediocre things about it. It looked like such a cool and unique place, and I had very high hopes for it. We arrived around 8pm. We were told there would be a 25 minute wait, which was odd considering the restaurant was fairly empty (including the outside section because it was pouring out). After waiting over 30 min, we started walking around to see what was going on. After doing this, we suddenly got a text that our table was ready, and as we were walking to the table we could see that almost every other table in the restaurant was empty. We ordered 4 waters and received them after about 5 minutes. We were already feeling a bit leery about staying, but decided to go ahead and order because we had already picked what we wanted to order since we had looked at a menu while waiting for the table. We even signed up for the mailing list and received a free appetizer and had an appetizer picked out to order as well. When the waitress brought our waters, she said (and I quote), \"I will be back in exactly 2.5 seconds to take your order.\" After about 15 more minutes of sitting there and never seeing a single employee walking around, we decided we had no choice but to leave and take our business elsewhere. No one even saw us walk out of the restaurant or tried to get us to stay. We think they may have been understaffed because of the holiday. If they had informed us they were understaffed and running slower when we got there, we would have left right away with complete understanding and no negative feelings. All of us have worked in the restaurant industry and understand that can happen. The way Rumfish handled the situation was very frustrating and not aligned with good customer service practices.   We didn't get to the next restaurant until after 9pm. Thank you Rumfish for taking a (very frustrating) hour out of my last night with my parents. I will never go back.",

The \"slow\" service is always lackluster to poor, the portions are tiny (I recently ordered a shrimp po' boy hoagie and got all of 5 small, overcooked shrimp and a whole lot of white bread) and the prices are borderline ridiculous.  (They charge $5-10 less than Morton's for the surf & turf for essentially a half-size portion.)  And don't bother to ask the servers about anything seafood related - as they seem to know nothing about the food. How fresh are the fish options, how often are they delivered, are they delivered fresh or frozen, do you microwave?  They never have any answers.  The vibe is very strange.  While the beach & live music is nice, it's seasonal and there is absolutely nothing special about this place for the other 7-8 months of the year.  And the place is not family friendly - especially with the \"suburban\" bikers and related attitude.  That's why on a recent Thursday night the Mexican place next door was packed with families and this place was almost deserted. I really tried to give them a chance (Pittsburgh desperately needs non-chain seafood dining options since this is the epitome of a \"meat & potatoes\" town), but Rumfish is just plain bad.",

If they would just create a better, more flavorful slaw to top it with it could be 10x better.

    "text": "Went to Rumfish last night and they are in the process of switching their menu.  Unfortunately half of the appetizers listed on the menu they didn't offer any longer. So we started with the oysters and crab dip.  Crab dip was good, oysters not so much.  Why would you put brie cheese on an oyster?  You can imagine the taste and texture.  Next we ordered scallops and porch in mushroom risotto.  Scallops were very tasty and the risotto was like mushroom porridge,Yuk! So the server did try to offer alternatives and we went with red potatoes however they were in olive oil and garlic but no salt and pepper.  Could have been much more flavorful.  Then when we went to the outdoor area, I ordered a blue moon and a Yuengling light as they couldn't offer the Sam Adams beer that we had on the patio.  Ok then.  But then the server comes back to say they are out of Yuengling Light.  Really?  Are we in Pittsburgh?  Let's talk ambiance.  When we arrived there was a local band playing which did a good job and the bar outside was busy. They stopped at 9 though to switch to a dj format.  Unfortunately at 10:45 the dj was STILL messing with his playlist and high school lighting.  I me toned it to the bathroom attendant who was just as frustrated but when I asked the bouncer why someone hasn't told the dj to get going he just shrugged his shoulder.  Needless to say we left.  I realize there aren't too many options for an outdoor club at night but really, management you really need to get your act together.  Lots of new places opening around town and you either can: excel, keep up or close.",

    "text": "Food and drinks are not bad.  Actually, when I've been there specifically for dinner, I've been quite pleased.  My issue with Rumfish is their nightlife.  The atmosphere is great, drinks are cheap and good, usually the entertainment they have is good -- all around, I wish I could enjoy it because I have in the past on several occasions.  Unfortunately, it was ruined for me a couple summers ago.  We got there at 8, I was asked for my ID by a bouncer and I gave it to him.  I was like 26 at the time, or somewhere around there.  No big deal.  Then, four hours, four cocktails, and a shot or two later, I was accosted coming out of the bathroom by an employee for my ID.  Well, sorry, dude.  But since I was carded when I came in, I didn't take it with me to go urinate.  So this douche follows me all the way back to my little fire pit area just so he can look at my ID.  And he was rude about it.  I expressed my disdain at the time, and on their Facebook page a few days later.  You know, it's not like I'm offended by being carded upon entry.  But get a better system.  If they don't trust their bouncers, get new ones.  If they still don't trust them, get a wristband or something obvious like they do in every other nightlife location so they don't have to police people at the bathroom.  Like, just because I don't feel like wearing a fuck-me dress every time I go out, it shouldn't mean that I should just expect to be policed multiple times after already having been somewhere for hours.  Sorry I take care of my skin, and have tiny boobs, and that just makes you assume I'm 11.  Ugh.",

She treated our table of 4 like we were an inconvenience to her.   We also had to get our own silverware, and tell the table next to us (that had the same waitress) where to get theirs.  Her demeanor was completely standoffish. My friend ordered a side salad, and we had to ask 2-3 times for her food to come out (after the 3 of us had our food). She just assumed that my friend needed to eat her salad before she got her food.  Our food was not great. My burger was raw, my fries undercooked, and my friends chicken were all over cooked and nearly inedible. It was evident that our food had sat under the heat lamp for an extended period of time. Their slaw with their chicken was wilted... WILTED AND BROWN.  We asked to speak with manager, to address aforementioned issues. The manager was not any better. He was rude to us, because evidently we're an inconvenience. He cut us off when we were trying to explain our frustrations. He rudely advised us that if we had a problem with our food, we should have told our waitress and he'd fix it. Well, it would help if the waitress came back once to ask us how our food was.  Tables next to us with a different waitstaff were treated respectfully. They also were seated after us, and got their food before us, and paid/left before us.  It took our waitress 3 attempts at giving us the correct bills.   This is why restaurants need to drug test employees.... I'd be better off getting a burger from Burger King...   We waited over 20 minutes for our checks. We will never be back.  We had to pay our tabs at the bar because our waitress ignored us!",

The fish was fresh (I had a variety salmon, tuna, octopus, shrimp).   The sushi bar and staff behind the sushi bar (one doing sushi and one doing oysters) provided a lot of interactions and opportunities to try their product.

The crab dip was AMAZING but we got the bigger size this time ($15 compared to the smaller one for $8) and it was not worth it. It was mostly bread, the same amount of dip and half our chips were stale. Overall, the food is very good but because of the slow service sometimes and the dip I wouldn't highly recommend. --Edit-- I tried to come here again for a quit but one night, we got there a little before they closed and asked when they're kitchen closed, she told us the time and said they were closed even tho we got there before they were closing.

When we arrived, they sat us at a bar that was over looking the kitchen. There was no alcohol served at this bar. The place is huge, but it was also empty. We asked if we could sit at a nicer table close to the bar or close to outside and the waitress said absolutely not, because every other table has been \"reserved for weeks.\" Well we were there all night, and not one of those reservations showed up. Crazy right?! Also, Rumfish has so many rules and regulations, I thought I was in elementary school again lol the bar over looking the kitchen didn't have alcohol. It's a BAR. and the bars outside didn't let you order food. If you were seated inside you were given glasses, but forbidden to walk on the patio with it lol. It was just weird and didn't really seem necessary.  Ok, on to the food! The $5 fish tacos were a STEAL! You got 2 in an order and I thought they were fabulous! However, they are $14 regular price and that's a total rip off. My husband got the burger with pulled pork on top and he really enjoyed it. It came with a side of fries. The fries and burger was a really nice portion, but it better be because it was $16! The menu was pretty pricey.  I thought the food was great, and I can say that I will be back to enjoy some sunshine with my cocktails",

My boyfriend already paid for the food so he wouldn't not take it. I wish we could give 0 stars  because that is what this place deserves it .",

If you come later in the evening they usually get a pretty decent crowd and frequently have a band or a DJ. Definitely worth a visit.",

    "text": "As a night club, Rumfish is great. Beach atmosphere in Bridgeville PA! Great music, surprisingly expensive drinks, but its pretty up-scale so its to be expected.  However, as a restaurant, it feels almost like they are playing a trick on you. Like \"How much can we possibly charge for mediocre food and take as long as possible with people getting up and walking out?\" The $26 for a Salmon Salad? Roasted Red potatoes that we hard as a rock despite asking them to be cooked 3 times (then clearly just microwaved till they were somehow both rock hard and a puddle of slime). And the service took... just forever. Im normally not one to complain about anything, but Rumfish should stick to what they do well and scrap the restaurant as a whole. Not just forgettable but actually a BAD memory.",

Other entrees were upwards of $30 and I'm so glad I didn't get one of them because it could not have been good either.  We got some appetizers from the Happy Hour menu as well and they were fine. Crab dip, fish tacos, and calamari ($5-$6 each during happy hour). Didn't have a problem with the quality of the price but they weren't anything special. Calamari was certainly frozen prior to being warmed up to serve. Fish tacos could have used some more flavor. Crab dip was probably the best of the bunch, but still just so-so.   Our waitress was nice and attentive, but I do want to note that it was not busy at all.   Ambiance of the place is cool. They have a big outside patio area and it's all nautical/tropical themed, but way out of place in a Pittsburgh suburb.   I would never recommend this place to anyone. Much better options around the area.  If you're in the area however and want to check out their happy hour specials, sure why not. Just don't order any entrees and don't expect anything great.   Two stars instead of one for the Happy Hour menu and theme.",

The outdoor space was awesome and fun. But the service is the reason i will not be returning and this is why:  1. The server was nowhere to be found for long periods of time. (Not sure if they were understaffed or if she had tables inside too.) To the point where i salked up to thebar to order.  2. I was denied being served a product (which i had already located behind the bar by perusing myself).  The bartender told my server that they didn't have the product. (Clearly didn't take the time to look and just denied a guest what they were asking for.)  The server came back to relay the message to me and told me that the bottle i saw must have been empty on the shelf.  I walked up to the bar and showed the bartenders where the bottle was. After this ordeal of ignorance i did get my tequila, woo!   3. The price of the tequila (i found with no warning from any of the staff) for one ounce was $14.00. That is 1 oz of Casamigos Relosado for $14. That bottle cost $52 in a pa wines and spirits store. This means that this place is making damn near $300 off of that one bottle that i, at first, was denied.  4. I asked for a manager and was not very understanding at all. His response to me about the ordeal was that his bartender didn't see it and he affirmed that the price for one ounce of Casamigos Reposado was indeed $14 and the coust of a double was $28. At that point i just asked for my check. He walked away and never returned. [Poor service on a managerial level as well.]  5. To top it off i used the womens room outside and not one toilet paper roll nor paper towel roll was in the dispenser. Also, there was litrally no trashcan. Just a pile of dirty paper towels on the counterspace.",

With two bars and waitresses and waiters walking around, it's easy to get drinks. Most recently, my friends (a group of 11) started outside but decided we wanted to sit inside and the waitresses were really accommodating and got us a table. I started off with a Liquid Haze mixed drink. It was made with Malibu rum, Captain Morgan and Melon liquor. It was really delicious and a little tart. My friend and I split two appetizers. We had the Buffalo chicken egg rolls and crab dip. Both were great! The egg rolls were interesting to me but I'd get them again. The group was overall satisfied and we had a great waitress, Larissa, who was very patient when it came time for us to pay! I enjoy coming here for a night out with friends!",

I got a burger which was huge and cooked perfectly AND (bonus!) was able to get Mac n cheese as my side - yummmmmm!!!! My hubby got a fish sandwich which was apparently good because I didn't even get a chance to nibble it before it was all gone. However, he claims he was just hungry.  We got dessert to go which was actually very tasty.    Overall, it wasn't 'so awesome I can't wait to come again' good but would definitely go again for a solid meal that's not too pricey.",

    "text": "A disappointing update to my previous review. My husband and I visited recently, and we were severely disappointed with our experience.   The first thing I noticed when we arrived during happy hour was that the place was nearly empty. The staff was pretty much standing around, even though the place looked like it could use some cleaning. It was also EXTREMELY hot indoors. On a 90 day, the doors to the outdoor patio and bar area were wide open, and there were giant noisy fans blowing any cool air from inside out toward the bar. It was warm and stuffy, to the point that my husband asked if the air conditioner was broken. The hostess stated that it was just warm because of the overhead doors being open to the outside. We were seated at a table that looked like it had been wiped with a dirty rag. It was off-putting, but I just wiped it down further with a napkin. Since the doors were wide open, flies were happily buzzing around indoors. This persisted during our meal, and was quite annoying.   The next disappointment came in finding out that they changed the menu, and it is extremely different now. At some point they discontinued serving sushi - which was one of the highlights of a previous visit. They also no longer have the coconut chicken appetizer that we both loved, nor the pork loin or seafood pasta that we ordered. When asked, the server recommended either the buffalo chicken egg rolls or the pulled pork nachos as appetizers. Maybe its just me, but I don't think egg rolls or pulled pork nachos when I go to a seafood place.   We settled on the pulled pork nachos and the drunken mussels. The nachos were decent, the amount of toppings were sufficient, but the pork was just average. The cheese reminded me a stadium cheese. They definitely werent anything to write home about.   The drunken mussels were pretty average. The portion was average, the garlic white wine sauce was underwhelming, and the ridiculously large pieces of garlic-cheese bread that was served with it seemed out of place. They weren't the worst mussels I've had, but they also weren't anywhere near the best. Sadly, this was pretty much the highlight of our meal.  Since the seafood options on the revamped menu left much to be desired, both my husband and I settled on the Beachside Chicken, which is described as \"Grilled jerked chicken breast, island slaw, yellow rice & pineapple aioli\". I asked for my pineapple aioli on the side, since I wasn't certain I'd like it.   Our meals arrived and the chicken was a joke. It was, by my estimation, a 3 or 4oz chicken breast, filleted into 2 pieces. The blackening seasoning was tasty, but since the chicken breasts were so small, the ratio of seasoning to meat was a bit overwhelming. The yellow rice, was literally, just yellow rice. It could have come out of a box. The \"island slaw\" was essentially cabbage, a few slivers of bell pepper, and what tasted like soy sauce. There was nothing \"island\" about it, and, to me, it just wasn't good. My husband did like the pineapple aioli, but it tasted \"artificial\" as opposed to being made with fresh pineapple. I ended up asking for a side of mango salsa, which ended up being my favorite part of the dish. I mixed it into the rice, which livened it up, and also dumped it onto my sad little chicken breasts. The mango salsa is what this dish needs to be cohesive. And, for god sake, stop butchering tiny chicken breast like this!   Including 3 drinks our meal came to $78 and change. Thank god I had purchased a voucher on the local \"Just Pay Half\" website, giving us a $50 credit at the cost of $25. Since alcohol isn't included, we still ended up paying about $51 for this meal, including the voucher cost. My husband and I both agrees that even that was overpriced for what we got. We will not be going back to Rumfish Grill, and I will be surprised if the business makes it another year or more.",

    "text": "Really mixed feelings on Rumfish. The ambiance is amazing.. a whole beachy compound all whilst being located in a strip mall in Bridgeville. Nice lighting. They paid out for nice decor and it shows. The food is okay to good, but not exceptional. The seafood stew sauce is awesome, but the seafood is often overcooked. Many fish dishes are good, but sometimes you get the sense your dish has been sitting under a heat lamp for a little too long. I like the food enough to return, but the service has been pretty offputting more than once. My mother and father in law came to town, so we took them to Rumfish for dinner. Our server was just bizarre for lack of a better term. He talked at us a minute, stopped back wayyy too often and started rambling completely unprompted about his personal life - like weird oversharing types of things - while we all sat there uncomfortably, even rested his hand on my father in laws shoulder at one point... super weird. He was sweating a whole lot. Really twitchy - just seemed entirely drugged up. We literally were not even able to talk to each other for more than a minute at a time without him returning to talk at us. We shoveled our meals in and left in a hurry. Probably would have spent more money on drinks if not for the weird, weird service situation. Seems like their service is a common complaint on here. With a wait staff that includes that guy, I understand why.",

I think the local owners are very open to ideas and change so I think down the road it will take off as a good place to eat. Portions were pretty small for the money however- needs to be improved.",

Every time I go, I start with the ceviche.  The preparation is a little different than I'm used to (much bigger chunks of fish), but always great.  On our last trip my husband ordered peel and eat shrimp, whole lobster, mac and cheese and fingerling potatoes.  All were exceptional, although I didn't get to taste his lobster, he wasn't sharing.  My grandson got the tuna steak and risotto with Ponzu sauce. It came perfectly prepared.  I was going to try the tuna also, but was enticed when she said they had a salmon special.  A little pricey, but so worth it.  It was simply excellent.  We have never been disappointed.  Each time our meals have been prepared exactly as ordered and very flavorful.  Service and atmosphere are also first class.  Seems as though attention to detail is very important. On our last visit, we sat near the open kitchen, and were pleased to see how the expediter took such care in the food that was sent out.  I would definitely recommend Rumfish Grille for the fish lovers out there.",

    "text": "This is a fun place to go in the summer for the cabana bar out back. They have a dance \"floor\" (translation: sandy area) with a DJ and two outdoor bars, firepits, cabana style seating, direct TV for the Pirates games, nightly drink specials, and frozen drinks. It is a good place to hang out with your friends on a Friday or Saturday and chill out. I wouldn't come here for the food. You have to go inside the restaurant to eat. The service is haphazard and I had to wait forever for someone to take my order at the sushi bar (this was after waiting at the regular bar inside where I was completely ignored). They are grossly understaffed and the mixture of indoor bar, outdoor bars, sushi bar, and indoor dining room makes for one hot mess when it comes to finding a server. I had a shrimp po boy sandwich and I wouldn't recommend it. It barely had any shrimp and what were on there were tiny popcorn shrimp that were tough and had obviously come out of a frozen food bag and been microwaved. My hand cut fries were decent, but lukewarm and slightly soggy. I'll go back over the summer, but just for the drinks and the atmosphere.",

On one hand they are set up for a party bar, with the outside bars, the stage and on the other hand they are trying to have a high-end menu with bland food. Also, they only have 4 or 5 suggestions for mixed drinks on the menu. What about a martini list or fun frozen drinks? I think this would work with more casual food choices to go with the party bar atmosphere. I will go there for drinks but not going back for dinner.",

My experience with dinner this past Saturday (4th of July weekend) with 2 of my closest friends was awesome! We were seated quickly (we arrived around 8pm), it was still very crowded, especially outdoors, but our waitress was very nice, even when 2 of us at the last minute decided we changed our minds on what we wanted to have for dinner. We had mussels and poutine for appetizers (a weird combination, I know, but still they were both very good). It was my first time eating mussels; I don't typically like seafood but I found myself liking them a lot. The three of us did the create your own entree, all of us had the salmon, a veggie, and we all decided to go with the mac and cheese as our additional side, which was THE BEST MAC AND CHEESE I HAVE EVER HAD. IT was creamy, cheesy and full of flavor! Honestly, no complaints and would go back in a heart beat.",

    "text": "This place is a FARCE. Rumfish must be overseen by a bunch of imbeciles, with no one having a clue how to run a restaurant effectively. How on earth do you run out of practically every protein on the menu, or glasses, and plates all the way down to the bread? This restaurant has been opened for a year and one would have thought it was their first night of operation. It is beyond my understanding how it is still in operation today. I visited on Saturday and the food is simply mediocre and I waited 20 minutes for a glass of beer, yes, my friends, 20 minutes. I was told the bartender was new, although I could see 5 of them serving drinks. I would have loved to quench my thirst with a glass of water, but was told by my waitress that they had run of glasses! Haha! When it came time to order my dinner, I had planned on ordering the Mahi Mahi, but they were out. What else was unavailable from the menu you ask? Monkfish, catfish, duck, both beef protein and several sides? How embarrassing, whomever is responsible for inventory needs re-trained. What a joke, we would have been better off going to Long John Silver's. Please People, do yourselves a favor and avoid this place at all cost. Terrible food, absentee ownership whom obviously has no desire in providing the residents of the South Hills community an acceptable dining experience. Summer is approaching, and the outside area is probably their only saving grace. Perhaps they should re-think their concept. RUN, RUN away from RUNfish grille.",

    "text": "I went here for lunch last week and dinner last night.  Good both times.  The lunch menu has more options and is easier on your wallet.  The atmosphere for a warm summer night is amazing. I am anxious to go here on a Saturday night before it gets too cold outside.  The fire pits will keep you warm.    So for lunch my fiance and I split two meals so that we could try them both, I ordered the Smoked Salmon BLT.  Very good and served with your choice of a side.  I was impressed with the variety of options they offered for sides including some healthy options such as summer squash and quinoa.  My fiance ordered the Fish and Chips which was also good.  The batter it was cooked in was crispy and had a nice taste and not too oily.  The fries were also good.  To premise this, I eat Fish and Chips almost every place I go and I'm picky about it.  This place was way better than Pipers Pub.    For dinner last night, I had the scallops and asian noodle dish.  The scallops were perfectly cooked and wonderful, although a little on the salty side, but I heart salt so I liked it.  The noodles were mixed with some veggies and nicely flavored.  Good hot or cold.  (I'm eating my leftover noodles right now as I type this cold, YUM!)  My friend had the crabcakes.  I ate a bite of hers and it was also very good.  Can't complain whatsoever about the food  Every dish thus far has been good.  We sat at the bar and had an attentive waitress last night (but this was 8:30 at night).  And I was offered a glass for my beer!  Both times I have been there it was not slammed.  So maybe I have been lucky (considering other service reviews), or maybe they are stepping up their service game.  Either way, I'll def be back for food as well as fun.",

Had to use our cell phone to read the menu.  After about 10 minutes of no one coming to our table, we flagged down someone who turned out to be the asst. manager.  He was very pleasant and apologetic and said he personally would be working our table.  The peel and eat shrimp appetizer was very good.  Although, we could have used a bit more cocktail sauce right off the bat.  I'm sure more was there for the asking.  Could have also used more napkins and a hand towelette.  Wife had the pasta with four vegetables.  It smelled fantastic, had plenty of veggies, and was flavorful.  I had the pork with apples.  Excellent.  The mix of apples and cranberries was perfect.  Except for the slow start, we were pleased with the night overall and definitely will return.",

Besides getting our drinks (after waiting 10 minutes for her to acknowledge us) she didn't do anything. Our food was brought out by the food runners (which is fine) but our waitress never once came back to ask if we needed anything or to just see how we were doing. We were served our mussels with no side plate so my boyfriend and I both had to eat over the shell plate. I got the peri peri mixed grill and it tasted like they poured the entire bottle of seasoning on my food. Later that night I got sick. Not worth an $80+ bill...do not go for the food  On the other hand, the outside is very beautiful. I would suggest you go to rumfish only for the social atmosphere - drinks and hanging with friends.

No food service outdoors, but a grill type menu will be arriving soon (like pork on the grill). Very limited on what alcohol can be served outdoors. No glassware permitted, so if you want a glass of wine...that's right...it will come to you in a plastic cup.

For the prices here I would rather spend a little extra and go to Monterrey Bay or Off the Hook where I know I will get an amazing meal. This place has been hit or miss, never does it provide the same experience as I had before. I gave it three chances and this past Friday was the absolute worst. We went out for my sisters birthday and at what should be the peak of dinner rush, 16 of us were able to get a table right away. Which was awesome but at the same time made me wonder why this place was not busy. We ordered waters, were brought seltzer water... Ever take a huge sip of that expecting it to be something else? Not pleasant at all. Then we received our $9 beers which were warm. Half of us ordered the lobster bisque because I had it before and thought it was so good, one of their best dishes. We received them and it was watery, very very fishy and just not at all what I have had on previous nights there. We had to send it back it was that bad, I never send food back. Finally when we all received our entrees, I had ordered the \"jumbo\" scallops. I received what they call jumbo but in actuality was bay scallops somewhere between small and medium size. My mashed potatoes that I received with my meal where like they had been sitting under the heating lamp too long and formed a hard shell over them. The broccoli was bland with no seasoning or butter for taste. Not one person in my party had a good meal that they would say was worth the price.  While the outdoor area is very nice it did not make up for the meal that was served. I will never be going back to this place.  I recommend if you are looking for a nice fish dinner to spend the extra cash and go to Monterrey bay or off the hook  in warrendale.  You would probably get a better meal at Red Lobster at least they are pretty consistent with the food.",

Especially avoid the seafood stew. I mean, Pittsburgh generally isn't the best place for seafood, but this place really sets the bar low. Too much salt, too overcooked, shellfish tasting spoiled, etc.",

Drinks are ole try and the atmosphere is great with both in and outdoor seating. Only issue is that we wanted to go to the beach area later and there was a cover charge and after what we spent on dinner (good amount) it should be complimentary.  Service was on the mark.

    "text": "So tonight we decided to give the Rumfish Grille a second chance. We probably shouldn't have. I'll get to why in just a minute.  I want to start out by saying that our server (named Jackie) was great. She was pleasant efficient and knowledgeable about the dishes. She couldn't be better.   Okay, that's the end of the compliments. We were asking a question about the menu when the manager showed up. She took a discussion of their vegetable choices and became confrontational. REALLY? I come from a management background. If a customer has an issue that they are trying to bring to a manager's attention, causing an argument with the customers is not good business practice. I told her that this was our second time there, we were not impressed with the establishment, but were here to give it a second chance. That would have been a cue to up their game, she missed the cue. I told her that I had reviewed them on yelp and would be again. Her response to that was appalling. She said that bad reviews were from disgruntled employees. Um... no. I 'm sitting in front of her telling her that I'm one of those reviewers.  I finally told her that picking a fight with a customer was exceptionally unprofessional. She started to stutter at this point, gave me a big fake smile, and stomped off. Wow.  Did I mention that this was all before we had finished ordering?  Our question was regarding the vegetables. They had a seasonal vegetable consisting of rubarb, parsnips and some other less than inviting veggie. They also had mushrooms, stewed tomatoes or cauliflower. My sweetheart wanted to substitute a salad, we had no problem with an upcharge. This was not available. My love ended up ordering a dinner salad to go with her dinner so that she could have some type of vegetable.   When the food came it was okay. At least the best of it was okay. We had it boxed up and will serve it to our dogs. As a matter of fact, our dogs had some of it this evening when we got home and they enjoyed it.  So, the bottom line is that the management is ignoring negative reviews and not understanding why the place isn't busy. I'm trying to come up with something positive to say... Well, if our dogs had thumbs they would have given a thumbs up.",

Still a beautiful restaurant, but clearly only a bar/happy hour venue now. Food was so so, service was just awful, and the place was dead so no excuse. Took a 1/2 hour to get a glass of wine, when we asked why we were told they were busy with big takeout order?? Hey, we were THERE, so take care of us. When we slightly complained we were immediately told by our waitress that 'manager could discount our meal'.  (Very telling). Well when the check came that didn't happen, and neither did the manager. As we one by one made our visits to the bathroom we notice fruit salad on the floor, it was never cleaned up, as our waitress passed by it many times...an accident waiting to happen and like I said, the place was DEAD. Lazy? Unprofessional?  Who knows who cares. I'm done with this place. A great reunion with friends, but so disappointed. Can't believe it's still surviving, I had heard it went downhill but wanted to give it another try. Must be one heckuva place for happy hour, because to eat there? Sheesh. Management needs to step up. Expensive meal, bad and slow service. I've never posted on Yelp before, but had to. Get it together Rumfish.",

    "text": "Came on a Wednesday evening and were seated at the bar overlooking the kitchen.  It was interesting to see the inner workings of the restaurant.  We were watching over the appetizer area.  Since I have not worked in the food industry, I wonder about the regulations about when to wear gloves and when it is permissible not to.  Yes, I understand that not wearing gloves happens more frequently than we know, but it was astonishing reminder seeing it repeatedly.  Ex. 1: plating salads, tacos, etc.  Ex. 2:  Worker put a small amount of chocolate sauce on a plate, realized it was a mistake, wiped it off with his finger, then plated the correct dessert.    The real reason for sub-par rating was the service.  As many mentioned, service is slow and inattentive.  Our waitress seemed like she was miserable at work and had little interest in her tables.  There was no greeting.  No listing of dinner or appetizer specials.  No \"service\".  Dialogue was nothing more than: \"what do you want?\" and \"are you done?\" before receiving the check.  Perhaps a really bad day?  I don't know.  Food was acceptable.  Clam fritter appetizer (much like a hush puppie) was the hit for dinner.  Meals didn't impress.  If you order the grits, expect five ... maybe six ... pieces of shrimp.  If there was a \"positive\", the outdoor patio looked inviting as we passed through the restaurant.  My concern would be whether or not we'd actually get drinks/service outdoors and if we could converse over the volume of the music.  The \"potential\" presented by the patio seating is the only reason to consider returning.",

For the main course, I had Tuna with Cilantro Rice, Grilled Asparagus and the Ponzu sauce. It was magnificent.   Another member of our group had their regular Scallops entree (very good!) and the third person had their Scallop special (very good, as well). Although, one of the scallops in the Scallop special was undercooked, the waiter saw that and immediately took care of it.   I highly recommend this place for the food AND the atmosphere.
