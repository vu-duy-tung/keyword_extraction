They could easily go to downtown or Lawrenceville   and be all fancy and up their prices by 50% and I'd still go with a smile on my face.",

I have lived in the area for nearly ten years, and am extraordinarily embarrassed and disappointed that I have not been here before today. The wings are very well made - fried just right so they're crispy outside and still juicy. The Royale with cheese is AMAZING. Get it with fries. Mine were fresh-out-of-the-fryer hot and crispy. My wife got the bacon wrapped pork chop special, which had a sweet and smokey bourbon glaze. As good as my burger was.... The special was even better! The iced tea is home brewed. In fact, damn near all of the food is home/hand made. Even the burger patty was handmade!   The atmosphere is very relaxed, which I love. It's a great go-to kind of place. Really wish I had found it sooner, and I can't wait to go back!",

Located just north of Observatory Hill on Perrysville Avenue, Bella Ria's is a family owned business serving some really great Italian eats. My boyfriend and I were in the mood for a pizza, so I placed a to-go order by phone. I was told the wait would be approximately 30 minutes. I arrived a little earlier to find the pizza already finished and waiting for me to pick up. The interior and exterior of Bella Ria's isn't exactly welcoming, so if you're looking for a fresh looking space, this isn't it. However, they make up for their lack of decor in the food. We both really, really enjoyed the pizza. All of the ingredients, including the crust were cooked to perfection.  We'll definitely order again from Bella Ria's in the future and (perhaps) dine at the restaurants instead of taking out.",

    "text": "I stopped by here last night with my fiance for dinner.  I have been by this place many times before as it sits right near the entrance to my old high school stadium where I still run quite a bit and somehow I have never though to go here.  That's probably because it really isn't much to look at from the outside and it shares the building with a beer distributor on the other side.  Anyways, I was looking at Yelp the other day and saw someone post some good things about it and decided, man, I should probably head there.  So my fiance and I decided to walk in not really knowing what to expect.  The inside is a decent looking space with 8 tables (I counted because there was one waitress) and then a counter.  Its only problem being that it looks very dated, like it was probably put in about 30 years ago dated. That's not to say it was too bad since it still looked and felt clean.  Above the counter there is also a TV which had both the Pirates game and then preseason Steelers game on it while we there.    For dinner I decided to go with one of there specials for the evening and ordered the bourbon bbq bacon pork chop which came with potato pancakes and a salad.  Whenever I asked if they had a vinaigrette, the server actually gave me a choice of three from which I chose the balsamic.  Before our salads came to the table our waitress brought us some bread which looked to be covered in some sort of oil and covered in cheese.  It was excellent as the oil had some garlic in it and the bread was a little crispy.  We ended up eating it all up before our salads came and our waitress asked if we wanted some more with our dinner which we readily agreed to.  Our salads weren't bad as they had some darker looking lettuce and none of the iceberg that you normally find.  They also were topped with onions, tomato and olives.  The overall taste of them wasn't too bad although I thought that my vinaigrette was a bit sweet.  After we finished our salads our meals were brought out.  My pork chop was thick but not very large, wrapped in bacon and had the BBQ sauce on top as promised.  The potato pancakes were also on the plate as well as some carrots and broccoli which was a surprise to me since they weren't mentioned.  I will admit that I don't like cooked carrots much so I won't really comment on them but the broccoli was decent and tasted a little of butter.  My potato pancakes were surprisingly good as they had some spices in them that made them interesting and actually made me regret getting some sour cream with them since it covered up the flavor a bit.  Finally my pork chop was also pretty good.  I could really taste the sweetness of the bourbon in the BBQ sauce and it went great with the saltiness of the bacon.  My pork chop was also cooked pretty well although some of it was a bit dry.  Overall though it was a successful meal.  I have to admit that I was also very impressed with the waitress as she was waiting on seven tables at a time and never really seemed to be in the weeds.  Granted everyone straggled in at different times but I still found it to be impressive.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  My only real complaint with Bella Ria's is that I think we paid a little much for what we ended up getting ($17 for the special I think).  Even so, I did enjoy my meal and know that my fiance did as well.",

Watched stink bugs crawl up the windows which the ledges were dirty.

    "text": "I have been here twice now and have been very impressed on both visits. The first was for lunch and I ordered what ended up being the massive Royale with Cheese and fries. Guys, this thing was huge!  And the taste was equally gargantuan!  Everything is made to order so it was extremely hot and fresh though that quality may take a few minutes longer than the chains. Trust me, it is worth it!  Next up was a visit for breakfast.  They offer an nice menu of standard breakfast items with specialty omelets and hashes. I went for the Corned Beef Hash and it was one of the best dishes I have had in the area hands down.  The real star here are the potatoes. I don't know what they do but it is best described as culinary wizardry.  Amazing.  I may never order anything else here again. I can't wait to bring some people to Bella Ria's for breakfast after this experience.  Again, this is a made to order type of family operated restaurant. You are getting high quality for the offset of time. Don't let that keep you away. The one drawback I do see is the small parking lot and limited seating inside. It can get cramped and there may be wait times to be seated. There isn't much room for waiting either.  I'd like to see them expand somehow to accommodate those rush times but at the same time, I don't want it to lose what sets it apart from other restaurants in the area. I'd rather make those sacrifices and retain the essence of what makes Bella Ria's great!",

The two best aspects of Bella Ria's are the homey feel - fostered by friendly staff and familiar faces - as well as the home cooking. A high portion of the food here is made from scratch. I've eaten here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and can highly recommend each corresponding parts of the menu. The French toast and pancakes are awesome, I always love the buffalo chicken wrap, and the pastas, salads and pizzas are top notch. The icing on the cake is the delicious desserts offered. The Oreo pie is one of the best things that I've ever eaten. It's a must try. Visit Bella Ria's! One try and you'll be hooked, and will become a regular I am sure!",

In fact, the one Sunday, we ran into the owner and he said that his wife told him if he ever opens on Sunday's, she's divorcing him. Ahhhhh the lives of small business owners.   Tonight I tried the Veal Parmesan with penne pasta and a side salad with homemade Italian dressing. The veal was crisp, the marinara light and the cheese gooey. Very delicious!   We loved the warm garlic bread with fresh Parmesan in top. It was so delicious and warm with a very light crisp.   The desserts were very good too - a berry crisp and a coconut cream pie! The coconut cream pie had toasted coconut all over the top. Super good!   I like that it's a casual place with lots of returning customers. They close early - 9pm on Friday and Saturday.",

At first glance the outside of the building is a bit dumpy and the inside looks like a retro diner. *****just remember looks have nothing to do with the food and I am glad I did not get scarred off by the looks of the place***. The waitress was super friendly and brought menus over immediately. Waitress took drink orders and brought over some delicious bread. I had the chicken parmesan which came with ziti. I have to say the chicken parm was among the best I have ever had. I would definitely highly recommend Bella Ria's for your Italian food needs. You can be sure I will be going again and again. Be sure to never judge a book by its cover as you will definitely miss out on some top notch eats.",

We entered and were greeted by a friendly waitress and were seated. It looks like they do a swift takeout business in addition to a sit down restaurant. The place is casual and friendly, no need to dress up- just be yourself. The food was delicious! Home made Italian wedding soup, side salads with fresh field greens, tomatoes and cucumbers... not a piece of iceberg in sight! We each got specials for the evening- linguine and clam sauce with a savory white wine sauce and plenty of fresh clams on top. The filet with port wine reduction and mushrooms came perfectly cooked with homemade mashed potatoes and roasted carrots. Everything was clearly fresh and homemade- we really enjoyed our meal and appreciated the friendly service!",

I love that they have the Italian sodas, San Pellegrino. They have four flavors last time I was there. Everything I've eaten there has been fantastic. I've had hamburgers, Italian food, steak, salads, the blue cheese dressing has big chunks of blue cheese, good bread, desserts are awesome. Everything there is very good. One odd thing was that a crabcake I ordered came with honey mustard dressing on top of it. I'm from the Chesapeake Bay area originally, and I have never in my life seen anyone put honey mustard dressing on a crabcake. If I had known they were going to do that, I would've told him to leave it off. I still ate it, it was just a little bit odd. I love this place!!  Also, sometimes you have to wait for a table, but not very often. Parking is pretty easy right outside the restaurant. The restrooms are very clean. It's a family run restaurant, I like that too.",

One server which caused us to wait a little bit for him to bus the table, but he was running around and answering the phone so we couldn't blame him.  I went with the \"Royale with Cheese\" which isn't really like a Big Mac, but better. Fried onions and crispy bacon set it off.  My wife had a side salad and the wedding soup, both of which she enjoyed.  I like the fact they had about 5 daily specials, even though I didn't try them. Will definitely be back to try some of the dinner specials I've read about from other Yelpers.",

My first impression of the joint was mediocre (diner-like, radio blaring, unimpressive) but not surprising based on other reviews. The place was bumping. Only one waitress was working so she was busy serving all the tables and manning the register. She was friendly and helpful when available.  Food: I got the chipotle pork loin special with red skin mashed potatoes, vegetables, and a salad for $18. It was excellent. My wife got spaghetti (angel hair) and meatballs which was also very good. Everything tasted homemade and had great flavor. The waitress gave us two rounds of garlic bread which tasted awesome (better than most fancy italian restaurants)! Also, we got conolli to go and haven't tried it yet, but it looks delectable.  Overall: The service and size of the salad that came with our meal was mediocre. However, the cost, quality, quantity, and flavor of the food overall was great! I recommend this restaurant and look forward to trying other meals here.",

I was seated immediately after walking in and the place was almost full of people enjoying their meals. They have a variety of items to choose from, not just pastas, all reasonably priced. I ended up selecting one of their specials - house made baby back ribs with seasonal veggies and red skin mash potatoes - how could I say no to that?! It also came with a side salad with a housemade balsamic, and all for $16.50. The ribs were meaty and fall off the bone with an excellent rub.  I didn't get a chance to try some of their desserts because I was stuffed so will have to stop by again.",

I always heard it is a favorite spot of  the local residents and knew at some point I had to try it for myself. Coincidently, as we were being seated, I saw we were next to a signed picture of Kevin Glavin, a well known opera singer. Apparently, he is a regular customer when he is in the area and the  inscription on his picture read\" One of Pittsburgh's Best Kept Secrets\". Bella Ria's had plenty of dinner specials to choose from and the regular menu looked pretty decent as well. It was almost impossible to make a decision! I chose the sirloin and crab cake and my friend decided on the red snapper special.  Both were served with a fresh tasting salad, steamed vegetables and a mashed red potato.  I like that the word homemade is used frequently . Which includes their dressings, soups and best of all.....homemade desserts!  The dining room is simple yet comfortable. Our server was very attentive and she was able to keep up with her other tables without skipping a beat.   We were very pleased with our dining experience and look forward to trying the beef brisket that is made in house. In fact, it  certainly wasn't hard to figure out from the thick aroma that a batch was cooking tonight and will be tomorrows feature.  Note:  Bella Ria's does not serve alcohol.",
