    "text": "Szechuan Express is a solid place for cheap, quick, Chinese food. It looks exactly like the hole-in-the-wall places that line Clemente Street in San Francisco.  Just walk up to the counter, place your order, then take a seat or wait around to carry out.   The food here is not gonna blow you away with high quality or uniqueness, but for $5 it will surely fill you up. The garlic sauce tastes very similar to the chili sauce, but again, for $5 don't bring in unrealistic expectations. Its a bit grungy inside, so if you need it to be super clean to eat somewhere then maybe you should choose another spot.  A couple good dishes are: beef noodle soup, double cooked pork, and chicken with garlic sauce.   The staff is extremely friendly too. I usually stop in around 2 a couple days a week for lunch and the dude who works there is always laughing and having a good time with the customers.",

The shrimp egg roll was actually pretty good but the beef with garlic sauce was absolutely disgusting. It had an almost jello like texture. Far too sweet and mushy to be even called food. So disappointed as I eat ANYTHING and I thew mine away. Add that to the 90 minute delivery time, and I wished I had saved my money.",

The fact that there are undoubtedly better Chinese restaurants but *something* makes you keep coming back?  Perhaps the world will never know!  But what I do know is that whenever I get a craving for Szechuan Express, it will not subside until I'm sated with a vegetable roll and - my current favorite - General Tso's tofu.  I've been grabbing food here for around 10 years and have never had a problem.  I'm very picky when it comes to chicken - if there are any \"bits\", I won't be coming back.  But I've always had perfect meat here.  I only recently tried the tofu and while it's not the best, it's still decent.  It's not too chewy and soaks up the sauce but doesn't turn into a sponge.  The General Tso's sauce itself is tangy and, yes, quite greasy.  But sometimes that's just what hits the spot!  You get a choice of steamed or fried rice; I always go with steamed.  I *think* you can ask for brown, but I always get the default white.  If you're looking for quick, cheap, filling Chinese without any frills, get ye to Szechuan Express!",

I go back every time I'm in Oakland, and I get the tofu and broccoli with garlic sauce, and I am content. Yes, it's a ton and a half of rice, but the sauce is delicious, and you get plenty of tofu and broccoli for, you know, a week. Food comes quickly and it's always hot. There's a cooler with cans and bottles of everything, there's plenty of seating, and the same dependable crappy music is always playing. And for all these bad reviews, there are always people there. Like I said, whenever I visit Pgh, I stop at Szechuan Express for a solid block of Chinese food.",

There are some great places to get chinese food, or pad thai in this wonderful city, but the combination of raw-quality and cheap cheap cheap prices rockets this place to the top of the list.   This place is amazing. It's always a good sign that the food is good when you watch the other patrons order and many of them are students at the Universities in the Oakland who hail from Asia, and order in their native tongue.   This place is NOT fancy... and there are poorly shot 8x10 photos of all the food lining the walls, so if you don't know the name of the dish you want to try you can always see it. I prefer this to some kind of kitschy wallpaper with pandas.   Also, I've never waited for than 8 minutes for anything here, and a single dish has never cost me more than $6... and that money will get you a take out container PILED with food. Get takeout, and eat it for at least 3 meals.   I once commented on how good the Pad Thai was here, and the guy behind the counter told me in good english, through a bit of an accent, that their old chef was originally a chef in Thailand, and he had brought his own recipe from home, and allowed them to keep making it that way. It is the best i've had in the city... not the prettiest, mind you, but the BEST tasting.   I HIGHLY recommend this place. Besides all this, where can you eat and feel like you are in the movie Blade Runner?",

Ordered on Grub Hub.  it took over 1 hour and 15 minutes to get the food...(it is about a mile and a half away, maybe)...crab rangoons were soggy and cold, and the filling is mostly cream cheese...Pad Thai was greasy and lukewarm, no peanuts (isn't that a staple of Pad Thai recipes???)  I normally don't call and complain, but we tipped well and I was starving.  They told me they don't put peanuts in ANYTHING b/c of allergies (but the menu clearly lists peanuts) and they offered to replace the rangoons.  Well I was hungry so I asked for Chicken and Eggplant to replace the Pad Thai...so about 30 more minutes later...we get only slightly less cold and greasy Crab Rangoons, and a gross interpretation of the eggplant dish, slathered in some dark brown greasy flavourless sauce.  No other veggies, just chicken..  Two bites and I gave up.  I'll be eating cereal tonite.  Oh, and I asked my BF,  \"is this the place you really like and we both enjoyed in the past?\"  Oops, no that was ORIENT EXPRESS on Forbes, near the museum/South Craig.  That IS good Chinese.  Yes, it was inexpensive...but when you can't eat it...cheap just doesn't cut it.  I think there's a reason the meals were 6.66.  I'm waiting for the stomach pains...",

The whole purpose of delivery is to 'deliver' the food to me.   I ordered their General Tso's chicken but there was a memo that I didn't get. They decided to substitute my chicken for tofu, which I personally think is the most disgusting thing known to man. It was so bad I threw the shit away and ordered a pizza.

The  meat was inedible and no longer even resembled chicken on the inside.  It was kind of like Chinese you leave in your fridge and then a week or so later microwave hoping its still good and then instantly realize its not and throw away.  My best guess is that they made it as part of a large batch, hopefully that morning but at worst earlier in the week, and then repeatedly heated it up and let it cool resulting in the sauce covered husks of string and rubber that they gave me.  The chicken fried rice was almost food but had a slimy texture to it which kept distracting from the flavor leaving an ominous dis-settlement in my stomach as I tried to ignore it, and then ultimately giving up.    I also ordered french fries just to get to the minimum for ordering and thank god I did because they were the only part of the meal that was edible with the added bonus of possibly being digestible.   Speaking of digestible, what little I ate was not.  I ended up awake most of the night sipping water and trying not to vomit, so uh thanks for that.  Overall if this were one bad meal I'd wait a month and try again think I maybe caught them on a bad night before making up my mind. However based on what I got they clearly put no effort into making fresh or even semi decent food.  Yeah this place is cheap but not cheap enough, if it were free I'd still warn against it.",

If you want autenticity go to the place that is packed with asians.  This is a Pitt/CMU tradition, and the heart of \"Asian Alley\" on Oakland Avenue.  There is no decor, it's packed in, and certinaly could use some renovations.  Save the complaints for a different style.  This is 100% authentic Szechuan chinese, and you should appreciate the complexity and style of the food served here.",

    "text": "A restaurant with an identity crisis. On the one hand, the fact that they have around 150 dishes on their menu, mostly around the $5-7 range, caters clearly to the college students in the area and those seeking fast and cheap Americanized Chinese food. Conversely, if you order the right items, then you can get a pretty good value meal, but don't expect any high-quality mainland dishes.  My tip: Look around at what some of the Chinese customers are having, and you'll probably have better luck with them. Their noodle soups, in particular the beef are usually quite large and very satisfying. On the other hand, I dared to try some of their new, more ethnic, dishes when they expanded their menu a few months ago, such as the Spicy Chicken, but they leave much to be desired.  It is well known that they may offer certain discounts if you order in Chinese, but even if you can't the food is cheap enough as it is. The eating environment is not very attractive, and it can get crowded and loud while the tables and trays aren't exactly clean. Mainly an eat and go type of place.",

If you order in Chinese, they give you an extra discount. The food is made really quickly--under five minutes, usually.  The food itself isn't that great. Everything is either too greasy, drowning in sauce, or both. Also, I wish they'd fill the boxes with less rice and more of the entree. I've had the beef noodle soup, which is flavorful but greasy. Both the beef and broccoli and chicken and eggplant dishes had too much sauce. I rarely go; usually, I bring people here only because they're curious about the cheap Chinese food.",

Finally after at least 5 minutes I was addressed and I placed my order. I couldn't tell if the server was unfriendly, if it was merely a cultural thing, or if he just had trouble understanding me. Anyway since I'm giving the benefit of the doubt here, I increased my ranking by one star.  I ordered the beef noodle soup and it was terrible - too spicy and the beef had a weird taste to it. Usually after I leave establishments one of the employees will either say thank you, have a good day or something, but not in this place.  A few things to take into account are that the employees were college age and it was pretty close to closing time so that could have impacted the level of service. All in all I just did not enjoy my experience and I won't be returning.",

There's not much variety around the university and I have eaten out so much lately that I just wanted to try something else. On the good side they have photos/posters of all their food hanging on their walls which makes it so much easier to decide what you want. You then head to the counter and order! The cashier then gives a shout out to the kitchen via the microphone hanging from the roof!;) the food was prepared so quickly I couldn't even properly sit down and get a glass of water!! This is unfortunately where the good things end. The food was awful. Drowned in oil and sauce. The meat was quite chewy and tough ( I had beef with vegetables). The rice was bland and when I tried to put some chili sauce on it, I realized that they even watered down the chili sauce! Or was there oil in it? I don't know! All I remember is the liquidy texture going everywhere. I probably finished a quarter of my food cause I was so hungry, but all the oil made me feel sick! You probably get what you pay for! For a $5 meal it was a huge portion. But if you're looking for a quality Chinese dish you should probably look elsewhere!",

Cheap food, tolerable quality, and generous portions are all I need to keep me happy and my stomach/wallet full. They really live up to their \"Express\" name. I've had food come out less than a minute after I put in my order which is probably a good and bad thing at the same time.  I can understand the hate. Is the food five-star quality? Absolutely not. Will you find the occasional stray hair in your food? Quite possibly. But for less than $6 an order, it's a great deal. Even now when I pass through Oakland, I'll stop by for some General Tso's tofu for old time's sake. Of course, they still remember my order after all this time. I'm a Szechuan fan for life.",

This pretty much speaks to all the high points of Szechuan Express--fast, cheap, large portions, and decent enough quality.  There are photos of all the dishes lining the walls--you should know to expect utilitarianism walking in.  Two of us ordered the 65 SAUTEED SHANGHAI BOK CHOY (made spicy upon request), 72 SHRIMP WITH EGGPLANT WITH GARLIC SAUCE, and 127 COMBINATION NOODLE SOUP.  Everything was okay, everything could have used a little salt.  Sauteed bok choy is pretty hard to screw up.  The eggplant was nice and saucy, but sadly the sauce was a little bland.  The noodles were the biggest disappointment--the veggies in it tasted decent enough but the chicken and noodles had zero flavor.  My fiance found it fine enough for lunch but not worthy of keeping the lefties.  Still, for about $22 for all 3 dishes and a huge pile of leftovers that I'll whip into a tastier stir-fry by seasoning the crap out of it, I can't say I'm too disappointed.  They named it Szechuan Express for a reason--even they know what's up.",

Based on the exterior of the building, you should not have super high expectations. A more \"dive\" style restaurant, this place is great for cheap Chinese food, conveniently located in a college environment. More authentic than other places, you can't beat the prices that range from $5 and up. They also offer more than 150 menu options.   While they offer General Tso's chicken, egg rolls, and other Americanized dishes. I haven't tried them. I know people can be very reluctant to try new dishes but step outside of your comfort zone and for such a cheap price, what do you have to lose? For example,  (salty pepper chicken),  (3 cups basil chicken),  / (seasoned beef or chicken). These dishes do not come in the styrofoam containers that most dishes will receive. They come in a plastic bowl with a clear top.   If you go at peak hours, it can be very hard to find seating. But take a look around and see that the reason you can't find a seat is because of all the Chinese people eating there. That should indicate to you that the food is decent, even for them. One of my Chinese friends eats here almost every day. As others have said, look around what they are eating, and if it looks good, just ask what the dish is.   Order in Chinese and you'll get a small discount.",

We ordered via grubhub's app. I ordered General Tso Shrimp, shrimp fried rice and a small extra white rice. The app offered a coupon so with 2 sodas I met the minimum to add on a free Young Chow fried rice.  Yea! Here comes dinner!  Delivery took a reasonable amount of time. The bag arrived and everything is packaged in Styrofoam. Two things here: 1. Who uses Styrofoam anymore?? it is terrible for the environment and 2. Styrofoam makes everything inside soggy. Yuck. And the sodas arrived warm. I guess they thought we'd like them for later or they are just too lazy to make the cokes cold.  At this point I notice that there are not only zero fortune cookies but zero packets of condiments. My kid was super bummed about the no-cookie bit (me too). Now for the food.  General Tso Shrimp. The shrimp are fried in a heavy batter, like a thick, cheap tempura. Since the batter takes longer to cook it does not take a genius to figure out that the shrimp is so over cooked that if you are lucky it is only just rubbery. Half of them were bone-dry and hard. Yes, they were that over cooked. I included a photo - the shrimp is a the bottom and is so shriveled that it looks just like the gummy tempura batter. Disgusting.  (psst - try this at How Lee - AMAZING)  Shrimp Fried rice. Wow. This was even worse. How they managed to hit both salty and bland is beyond me. The after taste was weird and off. It coated inside your mouth like dirty grease. One bite and the rest in the garbage.  Young Chow Fried Rice. I have had this before from a different place and that place was awesome. This one... and I am not exaggerating... made my daughter cry when I told her that was her dinner. Yes, full tears. I took a closer look and totally got it. I included a photo of it. The pork looks like jerky. I think there was chicken in it, who knows. It looked like vomit. I am not sure I would feed this to a dog it looked so unappetizing. The shrimp looked ok comparatively. No one ate this.  The white rice... yes, the ONE thing EVERY Chinese food place should be able to get right was even dry. Scraped up dry bits from the side and bottom.   It's been just over an hour - and yeah, I ate some, like an idiot. I was starving. Now I feel sick, that bloaty, nauseous feeling with a slight headache bad food feeling...  Terrible. Just terrible.  edit: 9/3/2014 - the business and I had a colorful back and forth about my review over the weekend and the manager indicated that in order to have a satisfying meal that the diner should only eat in or pick up - that the delivery changes the quality of the meal.   While I have my own opinions about this it appears that he likely also complained to YELP about my photos (and likely my review) of the meal I was served by his restaurant. these images, most notably, showed a shrimp so completely over cooked that it had shrunk to about 1/3 of its normal size and was swimming inside of the breading. the other image showed dry, unappetizing fried rice.   What struck me the most about our emails was what I perceived as a complete lack of professionalism and inability to listen to feedback from a customer. Further, if he feels delivery is the issue when why offer it?  To be honest, the delivery was the only thing that met expectation - it arrived within 45 minutes. I have ordered take out from a wide variety of places and have had great meals with it taking even longer to get to me.   so, bottom line for me? the kid who is managing this restaurant pretty much reinforced my opinion of his business. there are a LOT of options out there in this category and i will happily spend my money at any of those before I spend another penny with this place.",

I recommend the traditional Chinese one.  If you're that guy who order General Tso's or sesame chicken, then you're wasting your time here because what you just ordered is not in fact food but filth.  Next time order real Chinese food.  The stir fried pork with green pepper is spot on with its authenticity and flavor profile.  The average American will need to get a little adventurous in order to truly enjoy this place.  Take a look around you, are any of the native Chinese ordering orange chicken? No way.  Remember, there are two menus; do yourself a favor and order from the one that the Chinese use.    Also, Jason is really a lifesaver.  In case you're wondering what that means, just know that he's always got his customers' backs and never ceases providing excellent food with expedient service.",

Of course I wasn't expecting authentic Chinese food, but this wasn't even good Americanized Chinese food. This was one of the few restaurants that messed up Chinese food. My friend I went here with got sick off the stuff, I wouldn't recommend trying this place if your stomach can't handle it.    I got the vegetable delight with garlic sauce and my friend got the shrimp lo mein.  The dishes are hard to mess up but somehow this place accomplished it.  In my vegetable delight there was way too much cabbage stem and not enough of anything else.  My friend's noodles were bathed in soy sauce, she tried to sequester it into one pocket but to no avail for it pooled over to the other compartments.   One good thing about this place is that there is a HUGE selection. The walls are covered with their menu so that's a positive. However, the prices and selection are still not tempting enough to make me go a second time.",

I ordered chicken and broccoli and asked for strings beans to be added in as well. The food literally came out PIPING hot in 2 minutes. The green beans/broccoli were fresh and still had a crunch while still being flavorful. The chicken was good. Not anemic like some other places I've been and had a good flavor and texture. The rice was also very good - slightly sticky and the perfect base for the chicken/veg/brown sauce.  Atmosphere - 2 stars. I stopped during a busy lunch service where orders were flying out left and right every 2 minutes. The cashier was friendly enough and aced my order. The water/plastic utensils/napkins/etc are out for you to grab as you need. Let's face it - it's not a place to hang. There are pictures of the food and menu on the walls and I didn't get a particularly clean vibe.   If I were able to give the rating with the caveat that I recommend ordering to go and you're not getting anything fancy, I'd give it 5 stars. I'm torn!   Bottom line- if you live/work in the area and you like fresh, hot, chinese food with no frills - eat here. I know I'll be back!",

I'd like to try some of their other items as well, before I form an opinion.   The storefront doesn't look like much, but they have a large selection of food. Seating is limited, and during lunch hour it might be difficult to find a seat. I wish they didn't have to use styrofoam containers for the to go food, but then again it's pretty common to see styrofoam to do containers in most Oakland food places. The lady at the desk seemed nice enough.  Overall, I'll be returning to try more seeing that they have a good selection of chicken based menu items.",
