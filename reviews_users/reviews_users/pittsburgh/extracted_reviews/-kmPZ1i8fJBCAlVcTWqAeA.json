Overall though, it's a place I will enjoy going to again.  It's earned it's atmosphere, and after 87 years, it's earned it's spot as a landmark. P.S.  One more thing, we found out that if you want the Prime Rib on Saturdays, you'd better get there early, or call ahead and reserve your cut.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Tuesday evening with my wife for dinner.  We had both driven past the Grant Bar many times before and it was only after getting it recommended by a friend and hearing how amazing the Coconut Creme Pie was that ultimately got us there.  The outside of the building leaves a little to be desired as it is clearly pretty old.  Thankfully once you are inside it looks pretty nice.  There are three separate rooms inside with one being a large bar area, a second being an area that sells merchandise and the third area where we sat being a dining room.  The dining room was seat yourself and we found an open table and plopped down.  One thing to note about the dining room is that it is very open and so can be extremely loud.  I only mention that because our waitress had to tell me the soup du jour three times because I couldn't hear her.  For dinner on this evening I decided to go with the Parmesan cod and chose sides of pea soup and a salad with a balsamic dressing.  My soup came out first and since I was hungry I quickly dove into it.  It had a thickish consistency with large pieces of ham in it.  I thought that it tasted alright, especially whenever I got some ham in a bite, but it certainly wasn't anything special.  The salad was the same way as it was your run of the mill restaurant salad with a few toppings of onion, tomato and croutons over a bed of mostly iceberg lettuce.  Thankfully my Parmesan cod ending up having a lot more flavor than the soup and salad.  Even though its name for some reason reminded me of chicken Parmesan which would have just been weird, I still ordered it.  It came covered in \"old world bread crumbs\" with some Parmesan on top of a butter sauce.  The fish itself was somewhat flavorless and so I enjoyed the butter sauce and Parmesan which gave it a nice flavor while the bread crumbs added some much needed texture to the dish.  After my wife and I had both finished our dinners we each ordered our slice of coconut creme pie ($3 a slice on special!). Now this is where the Grant Bar really shines for me as the pie was absolutely delicious.  The crust was nice and buttery while the pie itself was decadent having a great creme with the perfect amount of coconut taste.  The bottom line for me is that I might head back here again in the future.  While some of the food left something to be desired I did end up enjoying my fish and the coconut creme pie alone might be worth coming back for.",

    "text": "I can echo a lot of other reviews when I say that this is not your edgy, trendy, hipster restaurant. You won't find any cutting edge items on the menu, but you will always find reliably good food. It's a charming place that's been around for years and years, known for their turtle soup and HUGE slices of pie. I've been there more times than I can remember but for some reason I've never tried the turtle soup, so I can't attest to its greatness. I have tried a number of things from burgers to shrimp to fish, and everything has left me feeling satisfied. And the pies. They live up to the hype, but be prepared to be in a sugar coma for the next few days. One thing to note is that they do not have much in the way of healthy or vegetarian options. This is probably obvious to most but I wanted to highlight it just in case. You will be able to find something on the menu, but the Grant isn't known for its salads.  What I think really sets the Grant apart is its wonderful staff. The service has always been excellent - the staff is welcoming, friendly, and kind. The servers know the menu inside and out and are happy to help with any questions or offer recommendations.  Come in here on a Friday night (especially during lent) and you may find yourself having to wait 15-30 minutes for a table. The Grant is packed with regulars, which I myself may officially be now? Anyway, if you do stop in, be sure to appreciate the Grant for what it is - a charming family-owned operation that's stood the test of time.",

I made a reservation and was glad that I did. The place was packed by 6. I ordered the combo - 4oz marinated steak and stuffed shrimp. I seriously didn't need my knife to cut the steak; tender and flavorful. The stuffed shrimp was tasty.  My dining partner had the rainbow trout which I also tasted - probably the best I've ever had.   I took a piece of the banana cream and the coconut cream home - goodness they were both wonderful - nice homemade crust and the topping was not overly sweet. YUMMO   Please try this gem - I love off the beaten path - mom and pop - homemade food - getting away from the chain restaurants- don't think you'll be disappointed.  Nancy was our waitress. She and the staff will take good care of you.",

Neither underbattered or overbattered to donut consistencies, the quintet of butterflied shrimp was cooked to an ideal stage. Also coated in batter were the above par french fries. However, aside from the chipper service, the rest of my pre-concert (Enslaved, Ancient VVisdom, Royal Thunder, and Pallbearer at Mr. Smalls!) dinner at Grant Bar was a downhill ride on a bad road.   My side of cole slaw, and the apple pie (with rock-hard ice cream yet) I had for dessert were both almost completely flavorless. The cup of Turtle Soup, something I had been dying to sample for most of my life, tasted like a Campbell's can of tomato-based fraud with microscopic cubes of mystery meat playing the role of the tortoise. For years my father has told me that area bars catch turtles and make soup from them. What I had last night came off as storebought and warmed over. Urban myth? Considering the harmless neoteny of these shelled critters, I am ambivalent.   Regardless, consider my experience to be a half-horsed one.   P.S. That shrimp was very good, though, easily beating out the faux (?) crabcakes I had during my last visit.",

    "text": "Intrigued by the range of ratings, I decided to try it when going through Millvale recently. If you are looking for a young, hip crowd, eating fusion cuisine....this ain't it.  If you want solid food in a working class neighborhood....this is it.  I even had the little old blue-haired ladies around me to prove it.  The walls are decorated with fake logs and guessing from some of the menu items, it might have been a German restaurant sometime in it's long past. The waitstaff was excellent. If you are looking for a server who is doing this while trying to decide what they want to do for the rest of their life....this ain't it.  If you want someone who knows the menu, and is quick and efficient....this is it. My philosophy when trying a place for the first time, is to try what they are known for.  In this case it is the fried shrimp and pie. Done deal.  So I was a bit under-whelmed by the shrimp.  The batter was underdone and pretty bland.  The cocktail sauce helped a lot, but some tartar sauce would have been better.  My advice is to try the 3-piece version first.  It won't fill you up, but you won't regret it later, because you will have room for the pie.  It comes with 2 sides, so I asked for a Caesar salad  They have Caesar salad on the menu, so they should know how to make it. The waitress said they could put some romaine on a plate and add some croutons.  Thinking maybe they didn't want to do a whole Caesar, I asked for the Caesar salad as both my sides. But I got exactly what the waitress said. A big plate of thinly shredded romaine, a few croutons and a cup with some obviously bottled dressing.  If someone else wants to figure out if they can make a decent Caesar salad, go ahead, it ain't gonna be me! The good news is the pie was excellent.  A large piece of thick and creamy coconut cream with a nice flaky crust.  If you decide to risk the 5 piece shrimp, you can always make the pie to go. Would I go back? Nope.  Would I go back if someone else was buying me lunch? Yup.  Would I go back for pie and coffee? Yup.",

After reading reviews here it seems everyone likes the shrimp and few like their \"signature\" marinated steak.  Living dangerously I ordered their surf & turf to try both.   Portions were small with 3 shrimp and a small steak.  The shrimp were excellent and the steak was medium as ordered and also very good.  It was neither over tenderized nor tough.  I did have to use my knife to cut it but it had a juicy pink center and was not chewy.  My wife had the cod almondine and she thought it was different than the last time she had it but she enjoyed it.  The mushroom soup was excellent containing lots of fresh mushrooms. They had no happy hour specials so we first stopped at the Grist House 3 blocks away.  I highly recommend that or Draai Laag for beer but both have limited hours.",

If you don't read this entire review I would like you to take away these adjectives used to describe this failure of a restaurant; disgusting, dated, bland, nauseating, repulsive, and low quality.  I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone. My girlfriend drove into town late and we wanted a place nearby to eat so we went to Grant Bar and Lounge.  We walked in and were seated quickly.  Our waitress was fairly busy and working a handful of tables but was quick to give us menus and take our drink order.  I should have known by the quality and cleanliness of the menu that we should leave immediately.  My menu was stained with unknown foods or fluids and crumpled like someone used it to practice their origami homework. We shared the Fried Jumbo Shrimp ($13) plate as an appetizer although it is not listed as an appetizer.  She ordered a glass of lambrusco red and I ordered a Yuengling.  The drinks arrived fairly quickly and the shrimp were a few minutes after that.  5 battered and deep-fried shrimp on a plate with cocktail sauce.  They were tail on, 12 count, de-veined and butterflied, then dipped into I believe house made batter and deep-fried. We then placed our main course orders.  She got the Broiled Seafood Platter ($23) - Comes with 8-10 36 count tail on shrimp, 2-3oz salmon, 4 scallops and a crab cake.  Turtle soup and baked potato were the sides for her.  I ordered the Marinated Top Sirloin Angus Steak ($20) - Supposedly this is a ~10oz marinated piece of angus top sirloin...sides were turtle soup and fries.  We also pre-ordered two pieces of apple pie to go for friends. The turtle soup arrives shortly thereafter with a breadbasket and crackers.  The dinner rolls were the cheap kind that you can buy in a tray (think Sam's club) and bake a sheet of like 48 of them at once, then pull them apart.  These are the type of white bread flavorless rolls that you would get at a fire hall chicken dinner or an all you can eat gun bash.  I had a roll, regretting it shortly thereafter.  I then tried the Turtle Soup.  It tasted like Campbell's Vegetable Beef soup and I question whether there was actually any turtle meat in it. I ordered my steak medium rare.  The steak was rare on one end and medium at the other.  However, that is not my main complaint.  This piece of beef, or whatever it was, must have been pounded for ten minutes to tenderize it.  The muscle fibers were smashed and flattened like a Swiss steak from a high school cafeteria.  The meat was somehow folded over itself with sinew and tendons holding pieces together.  I literally think that after hitting this thing for 10 minutes with a tenderizer, the cook took it outside and backed his car onto the meat and did a burnout on it and shot it onto the grill.  Hands down, this was the WORST steak (if that's what you call it) that I have ever eaten.  I did not finish it because it was DISGUSTING. About the time I found out that my meal was going to be horrible, I look over at my girlfriend and see utter disgust and thought she might throw up.  She tried the \"crab cake\".  I put that in quotes because whatever this oil soaked, filler laden patty of failure was, it was not a True crab cake.  She picked it apart and we find IMITATION CRAB all through it.  I could not find an actual piece of lump crabmeat anywhere in that heap of nastiness.  I was so embarrassed that I brought her to this butt crack of a restaurant.  I tried it just to see if she was correct and let me tell you that this was honestly the worst thing I have tasted...since my steak 30 seconds prior.  But now I was embarrassed for this restaurant and the people in charge of it.  The management and owners should be embarrassed and ashamed that they serve swill like this to humans...and charge them for it. She did not eat any more of that FAILURE CAKE or the salmon because it was swimming in a pool of butter.  She ate the shrimp, scallops, and her baked potato.  I ate my fries and we were out of that horrendous dining experience.  When the waitress came back she asked 'Was everything OK?\" because she noticed that neither of us finished our food.  I responded with something to the effect of 'Not really...is that crab cake...made out of...imitation crab?\"  The waitress responded with 'It's a blend\". The bill was $83.  Food this deplorable should be around $30.  I will never go back to this restaurant and will adamantly tell anyone that asks about it to run and hide.  NOTE TO MANAGEMENT/OWNER: You need to immediately investigate what is happening with the food served to your customers.  If you cannot figure out how to make a crab cake without FAKE CRAB, filler, doused in OIL then you should remove it from the menu.  Also, I have eaten angus meat for years and your claim of top sirloin angus is laughable.  You may be able to pass this filth off as steak in Millvale however I'm not buying it.",

    "text": "I stopped here for lunch enroute home and was glad to see they have their own parking lot.  When you enter you are in the bar area. The restaurant is sits in the back. I had a very friendly and helpful waitress. The decor inside is a like an Alpine ski lodge with a German flair. The menu is extensive and as is the case they had specials for the day.   I was going to opt for a sandwich and two sides but when I saw they still had the summer strawberry salad available I went with that since I knew it won't be much longer due to the season change. The two soups they were offering today were vegetable barley and French onion. I decided to go with the latter.  I got my food fairly quickly. The French onion soup was good but nothing to write home about. It seemed more watery than what I'm used to but it was good enough for me. The salad was topped not only with strawberries but also had mandarin oranges and almonds worked into cut up iceberg lettuce. Again it was good but not the greatest. I really wanted to try the coconut creme pie for dessert but was too full from the soup and salad. Maybe next time.  Expect to pay a bit more for an entree with sides but if you can get away with a sandwich or a salad it becomes more reasonable.  Located on Grant Ave just off the Milvale exit of Rt 28 as I had said you can park on the side of the building or inexpensive metered street parking is available.",

She was pleasant, accommodating and checked on us frequently.  The food: good, not great. Needs more seasoning. We won't make a return visit. The fried foods appetizer came with zucchini that I enjoyed however the marinara tasted bitter and metallic. For dinner we all ordered off the specials menu. I had the Jumbo Gulf shrimp. While I did like the house made batter on the fried shrimp, I would have liked more seasoning. The baked potato was good but they put margarine on it and I prefer butter. I enjoyed the veggie side dish they called ratatouille more than anything else on my plate...it was stewed tomatoes, onions and zucchini. For dessert, I tried the tapioca pudding because it came highly recommended by a family member. I should've gotten pie.",

Grant's is situated in a safe neighborhood with a parking lot.  The interior consists of a front barroom and back restaurant.  Decor is plain, but warm.  They have a full bar and serve much better than bar food.  Service is experienced and engaging.  It's hard to find large, breaded shrimp, such as theirs, anymore.  My only concern was the overly salted chicken soup to go.  Nevertheless, I've been there before and will be there again.",

    "text": "Our path to pie was paved with really delicious food and drink! While trying to decide to eat one day, we finally caved to try somewhere new that has been on our list for-ev-er. We went on a Friday at lunch, and instantly there was this vibe inside you were going back in time where everyone knows everyone! You can tell a lot of thought went into the architecture ad items on the walls inside, as well as a deep care about the food.   It's very american, homey, nicely cooked food. I thought the price we paid was very fair for the quality and quantity of food. I had the chicken parmigiana with a house salad (chose honey mustard dressing), rolls, and fries. My husband had the breaded chicken sandwich with onion rings. Both pieces of chicken were perfectly cooked without being greasy and the breading did a nice job of staying on the chicken. The fries and onion rings were perfectly cooked, and the onion rings with their simple breading were really good. (No onions sliding out of the breading!) With our meal we enjoyed a Troeg's Sunshine Pils from the bar.  When you visit Grant Bar, you HAVE to have the pie, you just HAVE to. (There's always room for dessert!!!!) Our server listed off the pies for the day and we chose the coconut cream pie and the egg custard pie. The egg custard pie was a very unique, and delicious pie. It tasted almost like egg nog, but with the texture of a fabulous key lime pie. If the pie is available when you go, this reviewer insists you try! The coconut cream was very delicious as well, but I'd say the egg custard was the winner in this round! Want to know something cool? I noticed, and then researched that yes the crust is pricked, and then brushed with egg white to keep the crusts from getting soggy! More extra deliciousness that shouldn't be missed.",

Often times it's difficult to find a restaurant where you can get good, quick food close to the venue that isn't some horrible chain.  First of all, the Grant Bar is large, so we have almost never had to wait for a table (just once during Christmas).  This past week, we went to two shows at Mr. Small's, one on Tuesday and one on Wednesday.  We ate at the Grant both nights.  The first night, we all had the surf n' turf or the steak and it was really delicious - cooked exactly how we asked.  The wait staff was attentive and made sure our beverages were always filled and they are so personable.  The menu is interesting in that it looks like a combination of a diner and a high end steak or seafood restaurant, so there are definitely plenty of choices.  The bar menu is your standard blank and blank, beer and wine, but that's just fine because the drinks are cheap and strong; perfect for a pre-game situation.  The second night we got burgers and they were just as good as you would get at Burgatory or some other fancy burger joint, again, cooked right to our specifications.  We've been there enough that we know it wasn't a one time thing - it really is a great experience time and time again.",

During our visit I think we were the youngest people there by 20 years.   Food: 3.5 stars.  The food was definitely above average. My wife ordered the ham with broccoli and chicken noodle soup. The soup was ok, broccoli was steamed and had a nice buttery flavor, and the ham was very tastey having been cooked with brown sugar. I had the cod with vegetable soup and home fries. The home fries and soup were alright and the cod with its butter and breading hit the spot.   The reason this is a 4 star is the nice staff and the cool atmosphere. A very quaint restaurant in millvale that your parents are sure to appreciate. This isn't a place I would frequent often, but definitely try it at least once for the experience.

You can totally tell this is a spot that sees repeat costumers day in and out. We had an early dinner at 5pm and it was packed with families and couples. The decor reminds you of a ski chalet, it's quite cozy. All you needed is a roaring fireplace!  We read the reviews about the battered shrimp, so we started off with that as an app. They were very good, and I believe that breadcrumb family recipe is legit. Plus, the cocktail sauce was surprisingly good. But the main dishes we split, between the rainbow trout, almondine cod and seafood platter were a little bland.   The real treat is the pies, as I stated earlier. Most are cream pies, offering their famous coconut cream pie, but also banana cream, chocolate cream and an apple pie, among other choices... I kinda zoned out after my excitement set in for the coconut pie.   It was light and fluffy and delicious, just like you'd expect it to be. Toasted coconut flakes just topped it off. I hear the owner bakes a bunch of pies in the morning and you get what you get by the end of the day, so I was glad to enjoy the coconut one!   While I probably wouldn't be back for dinner, I'd definitely be back for a slice of pie... or the whole pie!",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of the Grant Bar.  It's wonderfully old school and authentic, visiting there is like stepping back 50 years in time.  I highly recommend their pork chops. Their Coconut Cream Pie is a specialty that will be featured in the upcoming national Pie show by the very talented Rick Sebak of WQED.  It is light as a feather, flavorful, and everything a great Coconut Cream Pie should be.    This place is authentic Pittsburgh, nothing fancy, but reasonably priced and a real slice of restaurant history.  The bar part is in the front, but the dining rooms are in the back and the atmosphere is like hunting lodge.",

    "text": "Millvale is on the fast track to becoming the next Lawrenceville and with that said one place that should remain the same is the Grant Bar. Not only is it a piece of history but there's much more. I like going in and being treated like an old friend. Have only been a handful of times but the staff test you like they've known you a lifetime. The food, oh my, the food. We've had all of these burger place popping up the last few years and one of the best places to get one is right under our noses; without the price gouging. Burgers are so fresh and juicy and I'm dying to know what goes into them.  And the desserts...oh jeez the pies! My boyfriend and I are big fans of splitting meals. Let me tell you that a slice of pie is more than enough for two people. Seriously a small family could split a piece. Whenever I have people visit I like taking them to Pittsburgh area establishments that are off the beaten path of tourism. Grant Bar is in the top ten for that! Ok now after writing this review I'm starving.",

    "text": "If anything, come here just for the pie. But if you want to make a whole meal of it do it! This is a staple in Millvale and it attracts locals who have been coming for 30+ years. I was pleasantly surprised that this place was as good as it was. Everything is made in house including their onion rings and pies. As a vegetarian they have several options, but the place is especially known for their fried shrimp. At our table, the club sandwich was a hit as well. Definitely make room for the pie!",
