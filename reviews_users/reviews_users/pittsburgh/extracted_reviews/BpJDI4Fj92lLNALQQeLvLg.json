The most critical part of pizza is the crust and Slice rocks the homemade, hand tossed perfect (in my opinion). Not too thick, not too thin, just perfect. Next comes a good variety of delicious fresh ingredients. Slice excels in providing high quality cured meats, cheeses, vegetables, and pizza standbys like roasted red peppers and kalamata olives. Both the pesto sauce and the red sauce are full of flavor. I haven't tried the white sauce yet. Slice has three locations, but I'll be excited to frequently visit the one at PNC Park whenever I attend a Pirates game or just need a good pizza fix!",

And the dining area technically becomes part of the stadium.   This new pizza place here has nothing to do with the old corporate one that was here previously. Slice opened here in April of 2016 and has expanded on their original two locations in the area.   The owner is super friendly and totally passionate about his work, and you can tell. Because of his positive attitude the staff has a positive attitude and the food reflects that as well.   The pizzas are NY style and absolutely excellent. I can't wait to come back for a slice in the summers or any other time I'm in the area.   Pro tip: the little spinach rolls are amazing.",

My husband and I had eaten at the Slice on Broadway in Beechview and liked it so we knew what to expect. There are a few tables inside the shop and several outside. It was a beautiful night so we sat outside. They have a pre-game special of a large pizza and two drinks for $25. We ordered that with two extra sodas. We got half cheese half black olive and sausage. It didn't take long for 4 adults to eat the pizza. The sauce has a great flavor and has a nice portion of cheese. The crust USA little chewy and a little crispy. It's a great bite of pizza. The nice thing is that you can buy pizza inside the ball park as well.",

The garlic knots are good - they come in threes.  Maybe it scored some points for being attached to PNC Park and serving beer. I'd come back, it's good, but it's not a 4 or 5 star pizza place.",

Pizza is huge and so good!! Cannot wait to try their other locations, because the listed menu is limited in the stadium.  Still they also have pizza by the slice, salads, hoagies, garlic knots (which smelled delicious) and beer specials. You can order ahead of time, and can use the entrance as a gate into the stadium. Honestly such a great spot for families at the Pirate game!!",

Never a long wait for a slice of pizza that is almost 2 slices big! Great location at PNC park for a game or local business people on lunch looking for a delicious slice to enjoy. You can sit inside, outside, or take to go which is my norm!",

When I arrived at the check out to pay for my pizza..my eyes couldn't help but to check out everything that was behind the display case..so many delicious variations of pizza.. I decided on the meatball and banana pepper roll.  It looked good!  So I purchased that.   I brought back to the office and couldn't wait to try it ..  theres very little meatball or banana pepper.. it was all dough? (see picture)    I certainly don't expect it to be oozing out of the roll but should be at least enough to see or taste it? Well the dough was good -  seasoned with a lot of garlic and ranch was provided.   I am just gonna stick with the pizza from now on.",

    "text": "Pizza is not bad ... I enjoyed the texture of the cheese and it had a unique but still delicious flavor... some things could have been improved upon though. The crust could have been more crispy and less soft while it was still fresh but you can attain the crispness yourself by heating it up in the toaster oven at home. The result is that the pizza can be difficult to eat with the cheese falling off and the crust drooping in your hands - it's still tasty though. Also, they seemed to skimp a good bit on the toppings. We had the roasted red peppers and banana peppers. Although the toppings themselves were on point there was just so little of each topping on the individual slices that it was barely adding additional flavor to the pizza. Something else that disappointed our group was that the pizza delivery guy took a good 2 hours to deliver the pizza and we didn't order enough appetizers to hold everyone over which caused everyone to be famished by the time the pizza arrived. We even started to wonder if the pizza was going to arrive at all, nonetheless when the pizza finally did arrive it was still somewhat warm and edible.",

It's a part of PNC Park and the Pirates were in away in Detroit (kicking butt I might add) so the place was pretty quiet. Food was great, pies are big, and slices ample on their own. They have take-out beer too (Headhunter!)  Bathrooms were clean and sterile when we were there, but very creepy at night. Kids refused to go by themselves. You exit the back of the restaurant and the vestibule (where the bathrooms are located) is outside, not well-lit, and has a wrought iron gate closing off the park. Inside, the bathrooms are huge, all concrete, and, on this night, the lights inside were flickering a bit. It happened to be a full moon, so the kids were causing mass hysteria over these bathrooms. I personally thought they were fine.",

The staff has always been pleasant and is quick to take orders. I also noticed they are on the \"uber eats\" app for delivery.
