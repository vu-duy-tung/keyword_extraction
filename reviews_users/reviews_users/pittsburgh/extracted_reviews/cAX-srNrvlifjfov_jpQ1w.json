    "text": "Texas de Brazil is amazing your first time then kind of just plateaus at really good to good. Nothing will beat the first time you eat here, it's like nothing you've ever seen before. Endless meat, a decent salad bar and oh yeah did I mention endless meat?  The taste of meat is inconsistent. For example we went last night and the meat was medium rare and tasted amazing. The time before the meat was more well done and extremely salty. I personally prefer the medium rare and less salt. They do allow you to choose the desired temperature and will bring it out to you separately.   At $45/ plate it seems fair. They are very attentive to your needs and almost swarm you with all varieties of meat during your entire dining experience which is exactly what you want at a place like this. I recommend getting on the mailing list for deals and specials, that is usually the only time I will go because it will make a good experience great when you know you are only paying half price!",

The waiters ( I won't dare say Gauchos) were walking around with skewers of meat not knowing where to go!!! Many of them Passing our table when we clearing had our disc side up that we wanted food... When the meat finally started coming out there wasn't much to choose from. Oh and the $25.00 coupon offered if you sign up for alerts doesn't come until after you've been there. Asked the waitress if she could take off the $25,00 and she said they needed the code from the email.  When I got the email there was no code. .  Texas de BraZil does Not compare to Fogo by any means.  If you want a good steak in Pittsburgh go to Hyde Park!!    If you are ever in Philly and want impeccable food and service visit Fogo de chao!!! You won't be disappointed!!",

All 15 or so meats seemed equality destroyed with salt. I'm not sure if this is a tactic to reduce peoples consumption but I've been to other high end Brazil BBQ style restaurants and will NEVER return to this location.  That being said the quality of food and cooking was very good and I was left disappointed to be forced to eat sushi from a salad bar for dinner. The entire party of 6 were equally disappointed.

    "text": "First time at a Brazilian steak house, but the friend in our party of 4 said it was just as good as one he raved about in Montreal.   Know thy self before going into this fantastic spot.   If you want to go the salad/food bar route with an amazing selection of dressings, prosciutto, cheeses, lobster bisque, California rolls and so on...due so without shame. Not everyday should be one where you tackle mountains of endless meat.   If you do possess the fortitude to go full Monty on the full dinner...Godspeed. Rule #1: skip the sausage. This may feel dirty and normally I'd agree. However, every sausage you turn your back on leaves more opportunity for filet, bacon-wrapped filet, flank, lamb chop, rack of lamb, a countless collection of other meats and those little cheese filled table rolls.   Either decision will pay dividends. Choose wisely.  *Amendment* I was encouraged to tell the REAL story about my experience at Texas De Brazil. Please don't continue if you are sensitive to graphic imagery.  I'm ashamed to say this was my first time at a Brazilian Steakhouse. I was so over-whelmed by the constant temptation of filet, bacon wrapped filet, more filet, top siloin...O! there's the filet again!   *I'm warning you...this is where it gets weird*  As my party and I exited Texas De Brazil and made our way toward the parking deck I could feel the pressure building. My pace quickened. My knowledge of the interior lobby of the Sheraton I was walking toward was my salvation. As I began to run I turned to my friends and yelled \"SHERATON!\" assuming they could piece together the immediacy of my situation.   *Seriously. Last chance.*  The order of events once hurriedly inside of the hotel restroom went as such: -Seat cover -Sit -Wipe -Flush -Turn -Vomit -Flush -Turn back around to sit again -Flush  I had eaten so much meat that I nearly exploded. That being said...can't wait to go back.",

But there is some things that could be improved and what I noticed is when you go there past 7 you won't get too many choices of meat and most of your meat will be a little burned and even fired bananas and mashed potatoes looked like they were left overs.  every time you go for 2 people you will end up spending a little over 100$ for sure and when you do that you want decent food on the table!  overall, I took my friends there, I always recommend people to go there, we love it!",

    "text": "Kay and I made reservations months in advance for our 4 year anniversary dinner at Texas De Brazil and were not let down by any means. In fact, having only seen churrascarias on television beforehand, my expectations of a grand feast were not only met but exceeded from the beginning of our meal until closure. The term \"epic\" may be overused these days, but it most certainly deserves to be affixed to this astonishing South American churrascaria located in Pittsburgh's Station Square.   As you enter, you're whisked to your table by hosts that almost move like dancers, the staff at TDB performing like it's opening night for a show on Broadway, and the critics are in the first row.   A vast salad bar is yours for the taking...  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D3uts_gdx6VU&s=87eb8f2fa515a4f8a52722f1c09937dd89921c02a340a00ec40570f23cdf449d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=3uts...</a>  You'll find...  Sushi  Salads with myriad dressings.  One of the most chunky and kingly potato salads ever crafted, its mayonnaise dressing elegant and simple, its flavors extravagant.   Grilled asparagus.  Hearts of Palm  Fresh Mozzarella.   Smoked salmon.  Need I go on?   One trip alone will do a glutton in, and yes, this is an odyssey of gluttony made respectable. There's so much to sample that one can easily neglect the steakhouse portion of the meal (a much less expensive salad bar-only reservation package is available for the timid and/or frugal), but that would be a tragedy.   Men in vaguely ancient, martial attire wield long, imposing, sword-like knives and  staves that carry on them exquisitely glistening, unending specimens of meat, all of it seemingly medium-rare, every morsel serving as a reminder that the carnivorous is at heart, purely carnal.   Leg of Lamb, bacon-wrapped chicken breasts, filet mignon, naturally-cased sausages that pop when bitten into, parmesan-coated pork loins, flank steak, alcatra, picanha, braised beef ribs, obscene amounts of sirloin...I was overwhelmed, forcing myself to flip the green card over to red to stop the glorious onslaught of prime protein, all of it shaved from the metal spits in mouthwatering, sublimely seasoned flaps that contained ideal amounts of flavorsome fat.   I wanted to try everything. Everything!   <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DlYFGTf3M3Sc&s=253e7cecfe2c6121cf91c4af436ac8d26c1e4fa87bdf11c5689b210a72fcc8de\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=lYFG...</a>  I'd become so intoxicated by the food, I'd forget what I'd already tried. Plate upon plate of their pao de queijo (cheese bread) threatened to fill my stomach beyond capacity, the tiny, chewy balls of dough and parmesan proving addictive, irresistible. Mounds of perfectly fluffy, buttery garlic mashed potatoes nearly did the same as did the egregiously scrumptious, syrupy, sugar-coated sweet fried bananas which almost made dessert unnecessary...but dessert is always necessary...  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DQ4xTuv5dpBs&s=ab3dcb2c7b238953197c9a82c8b6bab3c4aa0c7aaff6d3f0c72df9b9409abcc9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=Q4xT...</a>  Coconut Chess Pie, Chocolate Mousse Cake, and Pecan Pie were all shared by us both. Yes, we ordered 3 desserts, going far out of bounds. We had become extremists. When would enough be enough???  The chess pie and mousse were each full of angelic, saccharine cream while the pecan pie brought us down to earth with its molasses, shoofly mouthfeel and nutty essence.  Our exorbitant bill (smack!) reflected our exorbitant appetites. We felt as if we'd been led astray by Hunter S.Thompson for a lost weekend only for him to kick us out of his limousine, abandoning us on a roadside, never to speak to us again. Yet we were without regret.   Dinner at Texas De Brazil is an evening of sheer indulgence not for those whose will is strong. To show restraint here is to be cheated out of something juicy, rich, savory, sweet, unforgettable. You are meant to eat everything you see and everything you shouldn't. You are meant to go home in a near-coma after attempting to stagger out of the dining room under your own power. Cast your inhibitions aside and have the meal of your life with that person most central to your life.   P.S. The service provided by everyone in the house from front to back was the absolute tops. The entire crew went out of their way to ensure that we left undoubtedly satisfied, and we were undoubtedly satisfied times 3.",

    "text": "The food is amazing, the service is TERRIBLE. I have no problem paying $50+ per person, but when I am paying for a meal that costs hundreds of dollars I expect to be treated with common courtesy.  To be completely honest, I have received better service from MCDONALDS than I have from Texas De Brazil. Nearly every waitress at Texas De Brazil walks around with a chip on her shoulder and gives everyone at the table an attitude.  The last two times I went to this restaurant we had to deal with a snotty and rude wait staff that ruined the meal for everyone at the table.  There was one evening where myself and 5 others arrived about 30 minutes before closing and had the rudest, least attentive waitress I have ever encountered in any establishment. Ever. Not exaggerating at all. She gave us attitude the whole time, didn't smile, didn't ask how anyone was doing, and looked ticked off, miserable, and pissed/annoyed at us the whole time. She didn't notice, or care, when we were missing a place setting and needed more silverware. She made us all feel very uncomfortable and unwelcome. We asked her for a rare cut of meat to be delivered to the table and she gave us attitude about that and made it seem like it was a huge problem. We should have gotten up and left right then.  At the end of the meal we asked for dessert, and once again, received an enormous amount of attitude. I think she was the snottiest at that point, and after she took the dessert order we had had enough of being treated like shit and took the dessert in to-go boxes. I completely regretted going out to dine that evening.  We hoped that that treatment was us catching them on a bad night, and decided to give them one more try...  The last time I went to the restaurant I had made reservations for a large party of 40 people. The majority of the people in our party are professional tattoo artists, many of which have been featured on national and international television numerous times. We all came to the restaurant directly from a tattoo convention in Pittsburgh, and due to this, half of our party ended up arriving later than our reservation time.  I checked in with the hostess at 7PM along with 5-6 others and she directed us to wait at the bar. About 30-45 minutes later I received a call on my cell phone from the hostess, asking me where my party was and if we were still going to make it to dinner. Um, didn't I check in with her already? Did she forget? She smoking some mary jane?  While we were waiting at the bar, this pillow faced woman (who also has an attitude) approached me and curtly asked how everyone would be paying and then, after giving us a really fake attempt at a smile, immediately left. She didn't even attempt to be courteous, didn't ask how we were doing. Wow.  I had to leave the meal before everyone else due to not feeling well, so I got up and tracked down our waitress to ask her to pay for my bill and two others. Apparently this was a huge problem for her, and she asked me, \"How many glasses of wine did your friend have? Did she pay at the bar or at the table? She ordered a creme brulee right?\" ISN'T THAT THE WAIT STAFF'S JOB TO KEEP TRACK OF THE ORDER? That is NOT my responsibility lady, that is YOURS.  I was trying to talk to her about the bill and she rudely walked away from me in the middle of the conversation! I couldn't believe it! I had to chase her down AGAIN to have her take care of the bill. How utterly and unbelievably RUDE.  The worst part of the entire evening? I later found out that they DOUBLE CHARGED THE TAB ON MY FRIEND. Yes, that's right. I PAID FOR HER ENTIRE TAB, AND THEY DELIVERED THE SAME BILL AFTER I LEFT, BILLING US TWICE FOR THE SAME MEAL. Unbelievable.  The hiring manager at Texas De Brazil needs to get his head out of his ass and fire the rude and inattentive wait staff.  I have worked in the hospitality industry for years as a busser, hostess, and waitress, and I would NEVER have treated my patrons as badly as I was treated by these jerks. I am so appalled at the service I received at Texas De Brazil that I will never return. I don't care how good the food is - I refuse to PAY to be treated like shit.",

There were plenty of empty tables!  Once we finally sat down, all they brought over was fillet and flank steak over , and over, and over, again.

It is very inconsistent, which isn't a good quality to have for such an expensive meal.   The bad:  One experience, the beef ribs were cold in the middle, but somehow still cooked.  I think they were just reheated from the night before.  Also, the steaks are unevenly cooked, not a huge problem for me but some people might have a probably with the fillets sometimes being med. rare and other times med well.  Finally, not a fault of the gaucho per se, but he flipped my spoon out of the bowl and on the table splattering soup.  This occurred as the manager was walking up to see how the meal was going.  The act was an accident, but then the manager didn't even get anyone to come clean it up, I had to ask the waiter.  The good:  The service.  Overall, our waiters have been fantastic.  One time a waiter was average, but I think that might just be compared to the others we have.  The food, yes it might be inconsistent, but overall really good.",

Alexander our waiter arrived, took our drink order and waited for the others. Alexander explained the drink menu, dinner options and salad bar. The salad bar was great! In spite of other reviews, the salad bar had pewter looking name plates for all dishes, not paper tabs from a deli counter.  The Gauchos were more than attentive with the meat-and more than friendly to explain the cut,style and seasoning.  The manager made his rounds and ensured we were properly fed and satisfied!  I would give it 10 stars if possible!!!!",

    "text": "I think that any negative review has not dined at a Brazilian Steakhouse previously.   Yes, the meat is salty in most cases- that's how it's supposed to be. It's cooked in rock salt.  Yes, the meat comes quickly if you have your chip on \"green\". You are informed of that upon sitting, and encouraged to take your time.  Last night we had an excellent experience at Texas de Brazil. I was impressed by the choices on the salad bar- and had to fight myself not to eat all of it so I would have room for all 'da meats!!  Our server, Alex, was phenomenal and added to a really nice night. He was knowledgable about the two signature drinks we had and even met me at the salad bar to make sure everything was going well.  It was a packed house on a Friday night, but a manager stopped by to make sure everything was up to par. Good gesture.   This is what you would consider a \"dining experience\". I can understand how some would call it rushed (if the chip is green, I never felt rushed otherwise) or salty, but that's part of this Brazilian ambience. Take it or leave it.  It's a little pricey, but I don't consider it over priced. We had two dinners, four drinks (total), and dessert and it was about $140. I've spent WAY more than that at other steakhouses. We were there for a special occasion, so I didn't mind paying extra.",

Being a large open room meant that it was quite noisy.  There was a nice variety of food at the buffet, and it was quite enjoyable.  The meat is seethe by carvers who roam around the dining room.  To me, the flank steak was the best of what they offered us.  Some of the other beef was overcooked ( for me).  We had to repeatedly request pork, and when we finally got some, it was disappointing in that it was rather dry. The food is plentiful, so you should be hungry if you go.",

The server explained to us how everything worked and sent us over to the 50 item salad bar. It's definitely a salad bar but really so much more! They've got so many different fresh cheese and cold/warm salads to choose from.  After we finished the salad portion, they brought over the fried plantains which was explained to be the palate cleanser between meats (it really did work, so I definitely recommend utilizing this- they will bring more if you run out!) When you flip your card to green, the men carrying around the meat will stop at your table and carve you off a slice. Flip your card to red and they stop doing it until you're ready to keep eating.   We also had the red sangria, which was good (huge pitcher) but I'm not sure if it's something we'd do again because it added $40 to our bill and wasn't as extravagant as the rest of the meal.   We finished with a slice of Brazilian Cheese Cake and their Chocolate Ganache cake - which as a professional baker, this was arguably the most important part to me... and it knocked our socks off! I would 10 out of 10 highly recommend! Just make sure you're ready to treat yourself as our total bill come out to $155 before tip.",

All beautifully prepared!! I can't wait to visit again and shove all that beautiful meat in my mouth..(again no homo) if you've never been here you need to visit at least once.

    "text": "Meat metropolis, carnivorous conundrum, however I describe it you'll still have to experience it to understand it for yourself.  If my visit to Tin Front Cafe was my earth friendly food decision (see my review of them, awesome place) then this was my f*ck all the animals food decision.  Did I feel bad?  When you taste the marinated, sea salt infused lamb chop you might not feel bad either, but let's not get ahead of ourselves cause surprisingly there's more than MEATS the eye here.  Located in Station Square in Pittsburgh PA this protein playground is surprisingly low key and you'd drive right past thinking it wasn't much.  As soon as you walk through the front door though, you realize you've walked into the belly of the meat beast.  I couldn't help but admire that everyone in the place was happy and not a seat was empty.  While we waited me and my other 5 friends made our way to the bar.  I had the signature drink the Caipirinha (meaning little peasant) a Brazilian drink along the lines of a Mojito but a little more sweet than minty.  At $9 it was a small drink but that's to be expected at a place like this.  I will say I think it was great, and worth a try at least once.  Our table was finally ready.  We had the option of heading to the large and impressively fresh salad bar before we began our meatscapade and there's way more than lettuce on there.  Sushi, lobster bisque, potatos, fresh pastrami and hunks of cheese and bread and crackers populate it.  For $25 you can get just that and you could have a pretty good meal with just that, but that's not why you came.  After a sample of the salad bar the main course got underway.    They give you a small circle card that is red on one side and green on the other.  Green means go, red means please stop I'm so full I'm gonna explode.  Makes sense? Good lets eat meat.  Try a tablespoon of mashed potatoes and maybe one roll but save all the room for various cuts of seasoned beef, lamb, pork, chicken, and brazilian sausage cut fresh straight to your plate.  The lamb chops and the parmesan encrusted pork stood out to me.  All the steaks were flawless and can be cooked however you like them.  The sausage was smokey and delicious and the chicken melted right off the bone.  Make it a mission of yours to eat every meat at least once.  They can carve off just a sliver or a huge slice so you can portion your sampling out based on your stomach size.  They give you these sugar and cinnamon fried bananas to cleanse your pallet between meats and I ate essentially a whole bundle of bananas as part of my meal in memory of Haramba and because they are f*cking delicious.    At $45 a person some people think this is a bit pricey ($70 after a drink and a tip/per person) but you could easily eat $100 in meat and with that being said, it's pricey but for good reason.  It's not cheap and it only borders expensive for what you get.  This isn't something you would probably do every weekend but every 3 months I could see myself treating myself to this meat masquerade.  I waited a year to go and I can safely say it was worth the wait and actually made me wish I went sooner.    Go with a group for a special trip, this is a great place to watch each member of your party slowly tap out and turn their cards to red.    apreciar! (Portuguese for Enjoy!)",

They only fair warning and I don't know if it was just an off thing, the floors were SUPER SLICK so if you're toting around in 4.5\" stilettos like I was - be careful.

Great spot for catching the Gateway Clipper/Segway/Ducky Tours  Facility: Friendly Hostess and asked if we had dined here before to which we answered no. We were seated with a smile.  Explained the salad bar and meat options to us. You serve yourself at the salad bar and the options are plentiful if you don't eat meat. Then gauchos (Brazil Cowboys) come around with large meat cuts cooked at medium rare on skewers to cut off and serve as much as you like.  They also have a large bar area with good bottle selection. The facility is large and could easily accommodate a huge party at a moments notice with everyone starting to eat in under 5min.  My Experience: Stephanie walked us through the menu and cocktail list. Our server Rich was top notch, funny, professional and on point. Last, Slade (I believe) stopped by and shared his experience and growth inside of the restaurant giving it a family feel counter to most corporate restaurants.  In Conclusion: A must do for a large party or a very hungry couple that may be on a time constraint and wants a quick wholesome meal and excellent service from the whole team.",

I think the key is to know a bit of what you want before going in, otherwise you'll get full too fast! The salad bar is good but not amazing so I would save room for the meat. My fav was the flank steak, super juicy and flavorful. The filet mignon medallions was cooked well and very tender. My boyfriend loved the lamb chops and the leg of lamb. We skipped trying any chicken or pork, so I can't comment on those. If there are particular meats you like, you can let your server know and they will make sure it comes to you table.   Drinks were good, the caipirinha was delicious - closest to a shaken margarita. And the key lime pie after was delicious! The only negative is sometimes there was significant wait before meats circulated, especially if they run out before getting to your table and you have to wait for the next batch. I'll probably be back again for lunch since it's cheaper, or for a special occasion.",

The food was good, the service was average with a \"rushed\" feel.  The location is all open inside and pretty loud.  They were very busy when we visited on a Saturday evening.  We had reservations, but still had to wait for a table.  That is a little annoying to me.  This place really noisy and in my opinion has too many tables crammed in.  The wine I had ordered wasn't available.  The server did not know anything about wine or drinks.  Seemed like college kids working at the place.  You could see that the servers were rushing everywhere.  There were not as many people serving meats as the Ft Worth, TX location.  There were kids all over the place and at the salad bar eating right off it with no staff doing much about the situation.  Mostly parents to blame on that deal, but also part managing staff as well.  Overall ok experience, but was not what I was expecting from previous visits to other locations.  You can wear jeans and a tee-shirt here and be just fine.  I will go back, but I'm not in a rush to visit the place again.",

    "text": "I have been to Texas de Brazil numerous times and to various locations. My family and I fell in love with the restaurant at it's Aruba location. Simply awesome experience. However, the experience in Pittsburgh has been quite different. This first visit to the station square location was good - busy Friday night, pretty speedy service. Yesterday my family and I went to celebrate a birthday and it was a Sunday. We had reservations but still had to wait 20 minutes to be seated in a fairly empty dining room. Once sat, our waiter was nice and helpful and served us accordingly. The biggest problem with our dinner were the gauchos! We sat with empty plates (and bellies) waiting for them to stop by with a delicious skewer of meat. We were either passed by or they all went to a party of ten and were instantly cleaned out. It was pretty annoying considering the price of the place. I said something to our waiter and it helped...a little. Maybe the point in all of this is just not to go on Sundays.",

    "text": "Having experienced TDB in Aruba and then again in Orlando...the states still haven't met the standards of the Happy Island of Aruba when it comes to this steakhouse.  With that said, the Pittsburgh location was hands down a better atmosphere than the Orlando restaurant, and the food was great.  If you've never been to another one, the salad bar is fantastic.  If you've been to the TDB in Aruba...it's a little lacking.  I will say that no one really goes to a Brazilian steakhouse for salad...and the meat was excellent.  Even better than the food was our server, who was incredibly knowledgeable about the authentic Brazilian cocktails, the seasonings on the meats, and very attentive to our table.  This would be a great spot for a business dinner, any celebration, and the start to any guys-night-out/bachelor party etc.  It's a meat fest for sure, and I recommend fasting for at least 8 hours so you truly get your monies worth.",

I've been to the other two in PGH and the food and service do not come close to comparing.  I've been to Fogo De Chao (multiple cities), Chima, and a few other Brazilian Steakhouse as I travel the county for my job and this is right up there with them in food quality and service.  I'm not sure what the other reviewers are saying about the bad service, but the service here was awesome.  They were fast and dealt extremely well with getting the meat we wanted as well as cooked to the right temperature for various likings at our table.  Simply put....I'll be back.  Can't say the same for the greenforest cafe or the palms.   btw...my wife is originally from Brazil and I've eaten at Churrascaria in Sao Paulo and Rio in addition to all the chains here in the USA, so I can confidently say this is definitely one of the better ones!",

    "text": "We were sat in a too small table that was in the middle of a main isle. It felt like the table was just placed there to make more room. As soon as we were shown our table we immediately asked for another table and were told by the hostess that all the 4 tops surrounding us had reservations for 4 coming and and they couldn't place us anywhere else. We should have just left because that was just the beginning of a let down night. With a table as such, every tom dick and harry was buzzing by our table from both sides and we constantly felt the breeze and it always felt like someone was going to bump into us. It wasn't relaxing to say the least. The table was so small, i could not even place my purse anywhere, even hanging from my knee so eventually just ate with it in my lap. The most disappointing part of this dinner was that all the tables that were empty when we came in were all eventually filled with couples of 2 dining. After the third couple was seated at a bigger table I said something to our waitress. She apologized but said she couldn't do anything. The food was good albeit everything was a little too rare for me and we had to wait longer for meats that were medium. We had a super tough time trying to get our bill and we asked the manager twice to see if he could get it for us, which he did get the second time...that is actually understandable as they were very busy. I think the lies and bad seating has me convinced not to go back though. At 50.00 a head to start with, I can get a much better atmosphere than feeling like im going to get knocked off my chair by passerbyers/meat servers every 60 seconds",

We  waiting an hour to be seated (arrived at 8 not seated until 9) even though the restaurant was half empty,  We were expecting different types of meat  (lamb, beef, chicken etc.)as has been our experience at other Brazilian steakhouses.  All we received was filet and filet with bacon, no other cuts of beef or any other meats!  What!  I thought we were to be served other meats.  Not worth the money we spent.  After speaking with the manager all he kept saying was \"the good thing is you are still in the restaurant\", but no change in meats..  If I wanted just filet, I would have gone to an American steakhouse and not pay $50/per person.",

The salad area was remarkably fresh and had everything from cheeses, soups, sushi, eggs, breads, vegetables, salads, seafood...I could go on and on...  However the meats were the best part!  After I tried an array of things from the salad area, a troop of meat carvers came around with steak, chicken, pork, and lamb!  The meats were perfectly seasoned. I don't usually eat lamb but the lamb chops were too good to pass up!   I managed to save room for dessert and tried the bananas foster.  It was like banana pudding on crack! It was soo good.  I will defiantly be returning soon!!!",

So I was a little disappointed,  I didn't like how close the tables were to each other, it felt crowded.  When I  got up to walk to the salad bar or restroom I was bumping into people.  The food at the salad bar wasn't bad.  I just think for the price we paid there should have been more selections.  We ate there at 5:45 , its probably better to eat there later,  when we were at the salad bar there were a lot of people around it, the line was moving really slow. The meat selection was okay, but I think they gave really small pieces compared to what I remember in Aruba.   The deserts were really good. The waiter we had was slow it seemed like we waited along time for things, because they said they were busy,  restaurants always give that excuse. I don't know if I'll go back there, I feel for me its not worth the price since I don't eat that much.",

    "text": "I visited Texas De Brazil this weekend with my mother and two of my siblings.  Each year we select a new place to visit, and include an agenda of events and restaurants.  This year we decided to \"kick off\" the weekend with dinner at this restaurant.    Everything started out great!  Our 45 min. wait was only 20 minutes, and once seated, we were quickly greeted by our server.  Our server's name is Maurice.  He began with an introduction of himself, along with a detailed explanation of the restaurant.  Which, I would like to add, is VERY unique!  Once Maurice finished his 10 minute spiel, he tried to encourage us to order alcoholic beverages (even though we all explained we were not interested).  We then helped ourselves to the salad bar, which was amazing!  A wide array of soup, salad, cheese, and a variety of various other small foods.  Once we were ready to begin the main course, we were greeted by many different meats.  All of which were truly mouthwatering, DELICIOUS!  The problem, and the 3 star rating, comes in at the conclusion of our meal.  We rarely saw our server, at least, until it was time for him to offer us dessert.  He tried to pursuade us to order something sweet to finish our evening.  We explained that we had already eaten more than we should have, yet he continued to be somewhat pushy.  When he finally realized we weren't budging, he seemed to get a little irritated.  At this point, we explained that we would like to receive our checks.  It took 30 minutes from the time we told him we wanted our check, and the time we actually received our checks.  And then, at the time we received the checks, we told Maurice that we had a coupon that we wanted to use.  Maurice seemed to be irritated even more by this.  Nonetheless, he walked away to allow us time to prepare payment.  From the time we received our checks to the time we were finally \"cashed out\", an HOUR had passed.  Mind you, only one time in that hour did Maurice stop by our table.  When he did, it was to inform us that the coupon was the reason things were taking so long.  I need to clarify that when we had first arrived to the restaurant, it was very busy.  But, now, around 9:30 at night, the restaurant was near empty.  So, to say that this was taking so long, seemed so completely ridiculous!  Not to mention, once we finally received our change and credit card slips to sign, Maurice lingered around our table.  It was so convenient for him to disappear during the hour we were waiting for our bills, yet once we were ready to leave, he was clinging on close by.  Needless to say, the service ruined the entire experience for us!  And, at $45 a person, it was VERY frustrating!  I sure hope others don't have the same experience!",

While waiting, we sat at the bar and had a drink served by a friendly bartender.  Once seated, the waiter explained the concept to us and we started at the salad bar.  I'm not really sure you should call it a salad bar as there were selections of hot items, sides and more not found at a regular salad bar.  Once we turned our disks to \"green\" the real food started arriving.  Did I mention the big selection of meat?  Everything from chicken to beef to pork to...  Did I mention that there was a lot of well prepared skewered meat?  Some was slightly over salty, but overall it was all well cooked and seasoned.  If you go, bring a big appetite.  This place is appropriate for a group, party, family (although may be a bit much for smaller children) or any festive night out.   Not sure if I would recommend for a first date.",

Our waiter arrived quickly after we were seated and eased us right into the experience. Immediately I felt comfortable here, as if I'd been here daily my entire life. We were directed to a plentiful salad bar that featured much more than salad. From sushi to heart of palm, the salad bar buffet already had enough to fill me up. Luckily I was warned by a family member who had been here to wait for the main event: the meat. Everywhere I looked there were men bring around skewers of different types of freshly made meats. A buffet that is brought to you and consists of sampling filet Mignon, flank steak, bacon wrapped chicken, pork, sausage, lamb, ribs, etc. Who could ask for any more? And to top it off, the wait staff was kne of the best I've ever seen. Not once did my needs go unfilled. They knew what I needed before I had a chance to realize it myself. My glass of water did not empty once, I never had to scramble for room on the table, and the waiter kept up friendly conversation the entire time. I highly recommend Texas De Brazil.",

You must be careful to not fill up on the salad bar before the meat starts to come around. My favorite items from the salad bar are the lobster bisque (my favorite of any restaurant, and *always* the \"soup of the day\") and the potatoes. When you are ready for the meat, you turn over your card from red to green on your table. The several servers come around and offer you meats such as filet mignon, flank steak, lamb, pork, chicken, and sausage. Secret: You must ask for the yummy beef ribs. For some reason, the restaurant does not like to bring them around as they do with the other meats. You also get a few side items--mashed potatoes, fried banana, and cheesy bread, brought out to your table (included in the overall price). They offer several desserts for an additional fee. I notice that this location heavily pushes drinks at the end of the meal. I have been to many other Brazilian steakhouses, and Texas de Brazil is my favorite one.",

What brings people to these kinds of restaurants is the meat.  The servers that brought the meat came in waves.  You'd have three or four come by at once, then you'd be sitting there for an extremely long time looking around trying to get someone to come fill your plate.    We came during restaurant week, but only about half of the restaurant was filled, so there should be no excuse for the horrible service.  When we were finished eating, we sat around for a very long time before we were able to get our server's attention to get our bill.

Our server, Livingstone made our experience enjoyable. he was attentive, courteous,and entertaining at the same time.  I loved it! it is definitely pricey but considering the quality of meat that they offer at an unlimited portion, it's understandable.  We had to come try the Brazilian restauant, it was well worth it! we'll be returning soon,hopefully!  I will be recommending Texas De Brazil to my family and friends.",

Beware of happy hour drink specials though, not every drink is discounted, i.e. gin and tonic was $10 and price of wine was very high.  Ambience: Upscale, very crowded, best make a reservation. Place is clean but lighting is VERY dim.  Food Highlights: Salad bar items were plentiful, fresh and delicious. The lamb chops were the bomb at medium rare perfection, some of THEEE best ever and so was the Brazilian Picanha. Didn't know sirloin could get that good. Filet Mignon, meh. Leg of lamb was tasty.  Service: Service was on point and awesome...until the checks arrived. Took about 1/2 hour to sort out check errors, including one that was $30 plus dollars off and NOT in our favor. Thus the four star rating.  After eating here be prepared to be stuffed for hours if not for days!!!",

    "text": "This meal was a study in contrasts: generally excellent food, outstanding service, and a most unappealing atmosphere.  From the moment we approached the host desk until the moment we left the restaurant, it was clear that we have to raise our voices to be heard by staff and ourselves. The restaurant is attractive.  It is unfortunate that individuals may dine here dressed as if they have come off the baseball field or in from a run; caps, athletic pants, and clothes with holes in them abounded. Our preference is seating a booth; there are no booths here.  We were placed at a table in the center of the noisy and frenetic dining room, so close to other tables that I was bumped by staff on multiple occasions. The salad bar was satisfactory, not great, and it is cramped.  I was disappointed that there were not marinated mushrooms and that the steamed asparagus had no seasoning: tasteless.  The potato salad and cabbage salad were delicious. There was only one soup, lobster bisque, something which has no appeal to one who does not enjoy seafood. With the exception of dry and tasteless pork that was brought to the table, we greatly enjoyed all of the succulent and flavorful meats.  The parsley-topped mashed potatoes were excellent.  No butter was provided or offered for the potatoes or for the mediocre, unheated tiny rolls that were provided. The rest room is tiny and inadequate: two urinals and two stalls, which was not enough to avoid a significant wait on a crazed Saturday night.  The meat servers were generally gracious and welcoming. The highlight of the meal was server Veronica, who immediately made us feel that we had known her for a long time.  She was attentive, efficient, welcoming, and charming, sincere when she said that she hopes to be able to serve us again.  My most recent visit to a churascarria had been at the King of Prussia Fogo de Chao, where my experience was far superior to Texas de Brazil.  For $44.99 per person, one expects excellence.  It is achieved here in food and service, but the atmosphere caused the evening to lack the enjoyment that we deserved.",

For those who are unfamiliar, Texas de Brazil is a Brazilian steakhouse that is unique. You pay for a \"dinner\", which includes a long buffet that features salad, soup, sushi, and other appetizers, and all of the meat that the chefs are preparing. You are given a disc with one red and one green side. Flip the card to green when you need more food, and the servers will literally bring food to you and slice it onto your platter.   The staff here is absolutely amazing, charismatic, and quick. They are very quick in getting you seated and thoroughly explaining to you how their restaurant works if you're new there. The other servers are super friendly and make sure you're getting your money's worth.   For an authentic, unique Brazilian steakhouse experience, come check this place out. I guarantee you will get your money's worth, and unlike other fancy, expensive restaurants, Texas de Brazil will have you coming back for more!",

    "text": "As a vegetarian in a Brazilian steakhouse, I was surprised with the amount of food I was able to eat. They provide a cheaper salad bar only option which is more equipped than your average salad bar.  The cold bar had your usual salad and veggie toppings, bread, cheese, etc. There's a smaller hot bar side with soup (not vegetarian that night sadly), rice, beans, mushrooms, and potatoes. I had more than enough options to choose from - maybe too much because I was dying at the end from too much food! Additionally, at the table, they provide cheese bread, mashed potatoes, and sweet plantains.  Dessert is not included in the meal and unfortunately, you'll have to pay extra if you want that slice of cake. A server comes to you with a tray of options. They have various cakes, pies, an creme brulee. We decided to pass on the dessert because 1) the sweet plantains served as a good dessert and 2) my stomach was already in pain from all the food at the bar.   My biggest complaint would be the disorganized service. Knowing it would be a busy time, we came equipped with a reservation, however, we were not seated until 15 minutes after despite seeing empty tables throughout the room. Even after we were seated, we kept receiving calls because some of the hosts did not realize we were already eating.   At the table, you get cards to notify the meat servers whether you want them to come up to you or not. Obviously as a vegetarian and having only purchased the salad bar option, mine was flipped over to the 'No Thanks\" side. Despite that, servers kept asking me if I wanted meat and one even threw a slice of pork on my plate after I said no. I think the systems has some kinks it could work out.  Despite a few disappointing moments with service, Texas de Brazil gets a 4 star rating from me. The variety and quality of the food went above my expectations. Even though I could eat any of the meat, it was a fun experience to see the unique serving system. I would definitely return in the future (but maybe with less form fitting clothes)",

The service was amazing and the food was delicious! A couple things we got later were a bit overcooked, but the first round was all perfectly prepared, too.  TONS of food, so we definitely can't go to restaurants like this often, but the food was worth the unhappy stomach.  The bar was nice, too. Great happy hour specials were surprising and the service there was great, too. Amanda was wonderful. Sadly, I don't remember our waitress' name.

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying I grew up on a cattle ranch in Montana and I never went a day without eating meat in some form. I LOVE meat, and if your like me you've been to many restaurants, had a steak, but it doesn't quite fill you up. Sometimes these meats are upwards of 30 to 40 dollars. Then someone told me their was a place for me. A place that had unlimited meats, and not just beef, but lamb, pork, fish and salads and cheeses. Immediately it called to my mind visions of a Golden Corral and I was very skeptical.  For 45$? How could that be good for that price? I was so wrong. The meats are cooked perfectly (although the filet mignons were a little over cooked) and the lamb chops were the best I have had. The waitstaff were also amazingly friendly. It gets even better: an upscale bar inside served amazing cocktails for very reasonable prices. I am hooked. I will return again and again. If you like meat, this place will be your go to for sure if you are really really hungry.",

Our reservations was for 7:45 we had about a 15 minute wait, but they kept us in the loop and was very friendly and polite. The decor was very nice, the chandeliers were high end vintage with a dash of modern, wood tables with nice comfortable chairs, a big block candle burning on each table with white cloth lien napkins, and blue goblet drinking glasses and basic silverware. The salad bar area had everything from shrimps to lobster bisque soup. It's not your average salad bar, it was well prepared, maintained, and clean. They give you a basket of these little round ball style of rolls. I did not like, but my husband did. Meat, meat, meat all kinds of meat! Chicken wrapped bacon, filet migon wrapped bacon, chicken parmesan, pork parmesan, lamb chops, Brazilian sauage(my favorite), flank steak, ribs, etc. if you're a vegan or vegetarian stay home or go to another restaurant unless you don't mind friends/family eating meat in front of you. You can do salad bar only. My husband had two strawberry style Brazilian drink, it was strong and good. It was crowded around this time and the noise was a little loud with everyone talking. Lights are dimmed, so it's kind of romantic. It was our anniversary. They gave us one free dessert, we went with the banana foster to take home. It was tasty. This is a place I would go to once a year because it's way too much meat (lol). I would suggest that they have cards on each table letting the diners know the selections of meat for that day. They do ask is there a meat you would like them to bring over, but how would you know all the meats? Overall, a very pleasant dining experience and our waiter was very attentive and polite. I would recommend to family and friends.",

    "text": "What a great experience!  My husband wanted to treat me to a nice dinner since we have been like two ships passing in the night lately,  so he made reservations here.  We had never been before,  so we didn't know exactly what to expect,  but we were pleased.    Our server,  Connor,  was wonderful!  He was very thorough in his explanation of how the dining experience was going to go as far as foods and what meats would be offered.  We opted for a bottle of wine to share, even though it was a bit pricey.... and I ended up drinking most of it myself.   The meats were cooked to medium rare,  which my husband likes,  but I like mine more medium well.  The men going around the dining area were polite when I asked for my meats to be cooked longer and were prompt in returning with them.    My hubby ordered the Brazilian cheesecake for dessert while I visited the restroom.  Very nice restroom by the way!  Dessert was wonderful!  Fudge, cheesecake, caramel & pecans.... YUM!   The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars..... The price.  Our bill ended up being $150 before tip. Had we not gotten the bottle of wine,  it would have been much less,  but hey \"when in Rome\" as they say. We knew it would be expensive, and it was good, but I think it's a bit over priced.  Other than that,  great experience & we will probably be back on a special occasion like our 1 year wedding anniversary in November!",

The salad bar was smaller than the other steakhouse I went to but it was pretty good. The meat was good. I enjoyed everything but the flank steak. The sausage, parmesan chicken and lamb chops were my favorites. The bananas they give you to cleanse your palate are delicious so were the beans and rice and scalloped potatoes. The lobster bisque was outstanding!",

Our server came over, was quite informative about the beverage options and the majority of our party went to the salad bar.  Upon getting our plates the meat parade began.   We had multiple servers visit our table offering us multiple different types of meat.  All were delicious.  We were also asked if we had any favorites and they were sent over as well.  I highly recommend the bacon wrapped filet, lamb roast, and short rib.  Garlic mashed potatoes were tasty as well.  This restaurant is built on exemplary service.  Managers stopped by to check on us, wait staff was phenomenal.  They even offer 20% discount for a myriad of individuals (police, firefighters, education).  This isn't a place I'd go weekly but it is excellent.  Yes it is salty but the food is exceptional.  Keep up the great work!",

    "text": "This is truly a meat lover's paradise. We went here with a coupon that we received after signing up for the mailing list (apparently this is the smart way to dine here). Servers were pretty attentive and helpful in getting us started with our first time here. As we first started out, we were pretty much swarmed with all different cuts of meat. It was cool at first, though as we ate through I think it would've been preferable to eat more slowly and get our food a bit at a time. The red/green indicators that we had were pretty much ignored most of the time--they were on red at the beginning when we were swarmed, and then for the 15 minutes afterward as well, though the gauchos still kept asking us whether we wanted more. Later on, it seemed that they got tired of us and stopped asking, so even when I turned mine back to green I had to be a bit proactive in getting food.   The food itself was overall very tasty. My favorite cuts of meat were probably the picanha, filet, and lamb chops--super tender, lots of flavor. At the beginning we wanted to sample everything, though later on we realized that there really is no need to. Use your judgment and just get the ones you feel good about. One particular cut was rather dry and we realized that it looked that way as well. Other than the meats, the sides were fantastic, especially the cheese bread and fried bananas. The unlimited salad bar was top notch as well, which included a lot of different cheese and cold seafood options. Great way to balance out all that meat. Though your wallet might want you to eat like 90% meat to get your money's worth, your stomach would be much happier if you kept that down to like 40-60% and fill up the rest at the salad bar.",

I love lamb, and while the lamb chops were good, the rack of lamb of lamb wasn't really. The filet was excellent, as was expected. The other meats were good as well. I guess where I felt the place was missing was the salad bar.   The other Brazilian steakhouse I've been to had a bomb salad bar. While meat should be the strongest thing, I feel the salad bar should be equal. You can't have a great meal without great sides, right?! Mostly everything I picked up off the bar I wasn't thrilled about. And it was a smaller selection than I thought it would be.   Service was excellent, but i would have expected that one because they must be attentive to be bringing you all the meat, meat and more meat and two because the place was pretty dead. It will cost you a pretty penny if you're not indulging though, since the whole meal is around $44. At that point you almost HAVE to keep the courses coming just to get your money's worth. And that, my friends, is not worth it to me.",

    "text": "I had a free entree coupon for my birthday so we figured we would give the newest Brazilian steak house in town a try.    Upon entering, I was immediately struck by how cold and unwelcoming it felt.  It was rather industrial in decor and seemed like they were trying too hard to be trendy.  We were the first table seated for the evening, so everyone was eager to bring food, drinks, etc.    First, drinks are very expensive.  Not that I didn't expect that given the type of meal and location, but $2.50 for a non refillable eight ounce bottle of coke seems a bit extreme.  The salad bar looked impressive, but I was expecting more.  Everything I tried was decent, but nothing jumped out as remarkable.  I was also hoping for more than just one type of sushi.  I felt the same way about the meats.  It did not seem that there was the variety that there were at other Brazilian steak houses that I have been to.  All of the meat was decent, but none stood out as favorites.  If I did have to name a favorite, it would be the lamb chop.  It seemed that rather than have a variety of meats and flavors, the same flavors were put on two or three different meats.    Service was exceptional.  Constant refills on water, meat, etc.  We were also visited twice by managers to ask if everything was OK with our meal and if we needed anything.  Overall an OK experience, but not worth what the price would have been if we paid for two dinners.  Next time I want a Brazilian steak experience, I'll stick with Green Forest in Penn Hills.",

I gotta admit, I walked in those GIGANTIC doors and was floored (haha, get it? This is an architecture pun...) by how huge everything was. It really is a great place to feel like you're at a crazy expensive joint. At the same time, it really is just kinda like a cheesecake factory of meat.  If you've never been to a churrascaria place and you're in Station Square and you're looking for something impressive, this will definitely be interesting to you. HOWEVER, there are MUCH better places in Pittsburgh you can go. Yet, I will still explain to you what churrascaria is (because we just established that you haven't been to one before).  You pay two different options of prices here (other places have other options): everything or vegetarian. With the everything option, you get unlimited meat of different types brought to your table and then you can have unlimited stabs (haha, another pun) at the salad bar which has far more than salad at it. If you couldn't tell, if you get the vegetarian option, you just can eat at the salad bar.  THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER: the cheesy bread puffs they bring are like HEAVEN in your mouth! Eat them! Savor them! But don't fill up on them!  Anyway, moving onto the review of this actual location, having been to other churrascaria places, I was really disappointed by how few different cuts of meat they brought around. They were supposed to have some ridiculous number (like over 20 or something), but we were only ever brought about 8 different kinds. This really made me feel like they were trying to cheapskate everyone. At Green Forrest, we literally tried every single kind they make.  So basically? I'll never go here again, but if you're visiting Pittsburgh and don't have a car or something, sure... try this place out.",

    "text": "I really didn't want to come here, because I really despise going to Station Square.  On top of that I'm not a big meat eater but my brother has been dying to try this place so I went. The place was packed which you would think is a good sign but since the majority of people seem to think that fine dining IS a chain restaurant, that didn't tell me much.   You have two options you can either do the salad bar on its own or you can have the salad bar with the meat courses - they have traveling servers who make their way around the dining room with various meat options to offer diners who have ordered full service.  Each person gets a small card with green on one side and red on the other.  Green means that you want meat (or ordered the meat in addition to the salad bar), red means no more meat, and no card means you just ordered the salad bar.  I opted to just go for the salad bar as there was a lot of interesting options available from fresh veggies and cheeses to shrimp, pastas, and salads.  They also had some hot bar items like lobster bisque, roasted potatoes, etc.  My brother and his girlfriend decided to each get the meat with the salad bar, but it ended up that neither of them ate much meat because the salad bar had so much to offer.  Overall the food was good, but it just didn't knock my socks off.   Our server also charged me for the meat option when I only had the salad bar and it was a little bit of a hassle to get it fixed and mostly that was just annoying given that I'd had a conversation with her about my choice prior to making my decision to just go with the salad bar.  Also, the meat servers kept reaching over me to serve meat to others at the table, which was incredibly annoying and also simply lacking proper serving etiquette.  It was a typical \"fancy\" chain restaurant experience.  I can't say that I'd race back there again, but I wouldn't object to going there, though I know that given it's location at Station Square that they will not have any trouble staying busy.  If you really LOVE meat, then this really is the place for you, but if you just \"like\" meat and the thought of eating pounds of it to get your money's worth then you might be better off going somewhere else.",

We have dined at locations in Florida and Illinois, so we knew exactly what to expect from Texas De Brazil.  But what we didn't expect was the \"Burghin-ization\" of this chain.  At other locations, you are greeted at an elegant and serene hostess stand away from the dining room.  In Da Burgh, it's more like walking into a high school gymnasium.  We had to shout at the hostess so she could hear our names.  The acoustics are horrendous.  The beautiful lighting fixtures are lost in the din of the ugly black ceiling.  The tables are helter skelter.  As another diner mentions, you can't go to the ladies room without having to knock at least 3 people over.    The elegant salad bar topped with their signature massive floral arrangement seems surrounded by the homeless lining up for their last meal.  Even the gauchos are different here.  Some of them are a wee bit timid, rather then proudly strutting around to show their meat. Maybe they will get of the hang of it.  Maybe not.  Where are the elegant white table linens?  Where is the incredible service?  To our dear servers, I am sure you are exhausted.  But please don't complain to me about how hard to you have to work and how much your feet hurt.  I am here to celebrate!  Only in Pittsburgh.  Now if you can just get by all that.....  We loved dining here.  Even with the lack of ambiance and stiff service, the food is still the number one star.  The salad and hot food bar is amazing.  The lobster bisque is delicious.  The salads are incredible.  And the Brazilian potato salad and marinated veggies are so good.  I am in love with the  pineapple carpaccio.  We loved adding the mushrooms with our beef.  And I am not sure why, but every meat tastes extraordinary at TDB.  Love the anticipation of waiting to see what yummy meat will show up our table next.  When we weren't seeing the bacon wrapped filet, we had to ask for it.  And we had to ask a second time.  So, don't be timid about asking for anything in particular.  For dessert, not included, we shared an incredible slice of pecan pie a la mode.  Sweet ending to an incredible meal.  Just a couple of helpful tips.  Try not to eat anything on the day of your visit.  Maybe even the evening before.  It would be a shame to not be able to try all of the TDB offerings.  And be sure to visit their web site and sign up for their E-club.  I see a free birthday and anniversary meal in your future.",

I thought this might deter him however he was very determined to have his steak and eat it too ( pun intended)  If you're in the mood for something special please please check this place out yes the prices are pricey but you can pretty much get a good sense of that from the outside. I have been to a restaurant very similar to this in San Antonio Texas and they really do not disappoint. If you were any kind of meat connoisseur and just really generally like food you will find this restaurant right up your alley. The salad bar that they have in the middle of the restaurant is a meal all in itself serving everything from rice and beans, to fresh vegetables and shrimp! My daughter was also impressed at the bowl of random bacon that was strategically place next to the bread yes bacon!  This restaurant will give  you a taste of all of the meat you can think of lamb, chicken, and beef. When you enter the restaurant and are seated it is explained to you in depth how everything works if your coaster is on the green they will continuously walk past your table and offer you various cuts of meat to include Brazilian sausage, I love sausage  Again this place is a little pricey but it's definitely worth the extra stretch if you're planning on eating here I do recommend that you come very hungry because if you don't you will have wasted approximately $30.  All in all my service was very good and I am glad this is where my Saturday lunch landed.",

My family (wife and 2 x kids 12 / 10) really enjoyed our experience here and the kids loved it too.   For lunch and adult meal is $30, $15 for kids 12 and under. The bread, salad, cheese station was also pretty good as well. Every piece of meat was divine, but my favorites were the beef cuts. We finished our meal off with an espresso and I had a cappuccino. We would definitely be back.",

He explained he menu perfectly and brought us lots of different sauce options. The servers walking around with the different meats were also all exceptionally nice. They were funny and sweet and came around multiple times. The food itself at this establishment isn't really for me, but that's not knocking the quality of it. I was there for a birthday dinner, I didn't choose it. But the food itself you could tell was good if that's what you like. They had a wide variety of steaks, chickens, lamb, pork, sausage. The salad bar was unique, with soups, sushi, etc. if you are coming hungry and like meat, you will absolutely get your moneys worth",

    "text": "Just visited Texas de Brazil for the 2nd time and it was an AWFUL dining experience. We were part of a group of 6 who had a reservation, but when we arrived, we saw the hostesses scrambling to find a table for us. Once seated, we waited approximately 15 minutes to receive drinks, and approximately 25 minutes until ANY meat was brought to our table. The server asked us how we wanted our meat cooked to which the entire table said medium. I'm not sure WHY they even ask this question since every piece of beef we were served was rare, verging on completely raw. Once the meat did start coming to our table, we waited about 5-7 minutes between servings. The meat here is like a game of Russian Roulette, you never know if you are going to get a good piece or if it is completely full of fat. When the waitress sent the manager to our table my husband was explaining to him that tho we understand that the typical temperature of the meat is generally medium rare, we are getting meat that is completely rare. The manager was extremely rude and cut my husband off as he was speaking. His attitude turned us off COMPLETELY. I can go to McDonalds and not be spoken to with such disrespect as this fellow exhibited. He later came over to the table to try to chat but at that point he had already ruined an already bad meal for us so we just wanted him to go away and leave us alone. We will NEVER be returning.",

It was a tight ship that really gave you the cyclone of meat experience. When we dropped a napkin someone came running to replace it unprompted. The salad bar was extensive. Lobster bisque in particular was stand out. As well as the filet and lamb chops. The other meat choices were, fine. Some a bit dry like the chicken. Anything wrapped in bacon was incredibly salty. Other Brazillian grills I went to had more daring meat choices like chicken hearts, alligator, seared shark. All in all a really fun macho night out. I had to carry my friend out over my shoulder like we were reinacting the movie Platoon.",

My mother and I sat at the bar and had a few cocktails while we waited for my dad to show up (which took a minute) and finally moved on to sampling the extensive side bar. The side food was yummy and, while more plentiful than the last Brazilian steakhouse we went to in Vegas, was not extremely varied. The main course of the MEATS was delicious. The lamb chops were divine! I'm not a very big red meat eater (I don't even like steak), but the experience more than makes up for fairly straightforward menu. Most of the meats were distinct enough from one another that it didn't feel like we were being forced to eat one giant slab of meat for 2 hours. We had a lovely time and would recommend to anyone looking foe r a dining experience rather than a simple meal!",

Most restaurant week deals in other Brazilian BBQ establishments in other cities (such as Fogo de Chao and Chima) have removed these items to cut costs so I'm very pleased that TdB stands ahead of the pack in that regard.   Furthermore, I tend to prefer my steak prepared rare and the gauchos did a fantastic job honoring that request. Along those lines, the service was also speedy and the pao de quejo came out piping hot.   I am only docking a star for the lack of swordfish and seared pineapple that is often served at Brazilian BBQ. The salad bar could also use some maintenance and more options such as kale could be included. Other than that, all of the meats were of exceptional quality and cooked exactly to my liking.",

I was very excited because I have heard a lot about this place and keep forgetting to go during restaurant week.  We had a reservation and waited maybe 10-15 minutes to be seated, but the place was packed and I don't think they set tables aside for reservations necessarily, but I would definitely make one because we noticed others waiting for a lot longer than we did.   The waitress was extremely busy so she ran through what they were all about and recommended some drinks. Throughout the meal, though, she did come back to refill drinks and such.   We went up to the salad bar first to check it out.  It's not your standard salad bar- there's sushi, cured meats, cheeses, pickled vegetables, bread, different dips and sauces, a huge cheese wheel that you hack away at to get a few bits, soups (lobster bisque yum), and side options for your meats like warm wine infused mushrooms. The salad bar portion featured only lettuce, marinated tomatoes, croutons, fried bacon strips, and salad dressings. They don't have all the toppings that you're used to at a typical salad bar- but everything tasted great and the salad dressings looked and tasted homemade.   When we returned, there were fried plantains and a bowl of awesome mashed potatoes to accompany our meats.  We flipped our cards to green and, even though it was packed, immediately every 5 or so minutes there'd be a different type of meat making its way to us.  The brazilian sausage was AMAZING, the garlic rubbed steak was awesome, as were the lamp chops and ribs.  The only thing we didn't care for that we tried was the Parmesan chicken - it is chicken thighs, which I am not a fan of. It was a little gamey and really greasy and not very good.  They also offered me a free dessert since I was celebrating my birthday- I chose creme brulee which was delicious!  I really enjoyed this experience, but like so many others, you get more full then you've ever felt and tell yourself you will never go back because you've had enough. It's definitely, in my opinion, more suitable for a birthday, anniversary, or other special occasion, and not for everyday dining. However I would definitely return and bring some more family members merely to see their faces when presented with meat upon meat upon meat!",

To start, the salad area was very good. There was a huge variety of items to start our meal with. I loved the cheese varieties and the couscous.   After this, basically every meat brought to the table was absolutely wonderful. All the beef selections were perfectly medium rare, my personal favorite. I really enjoyed getting to have a small portion of everything offered instead of filling up on one choice.   Additionally, I cannot say enough about our server, Rich. He was incredibly attentive without being the least bit overbearing. Any and all questions we had were answered thoroughly and immediately. He was very friendly and definitely helped to make our meal one of the most enjoyable we've had. If you are planning on dining here, I highly suggest asking for him.

They were either understaffed or overbooked but neither is a good excuse for poor service. (2) My husband found a women's hair in his salad bar items and/or baked into the cheese biscuit, which we *might* have overlooked BUT... (3) A mouse was running in and out of the wine cellar area behind us and into the restaurant - a mere 20 feet away from the kitchen.   As if that wasn't bad enough, the staff and manager's reactions were horrifying: First, they did not seem to care or mind that a rodent was running loose. It was almost as if they knew about the problem before it happened. (2) I had to actually persuade the manager to take care of our bill. Unfortunately, his solution was to only slightly discount our meal rather than completely comping it. We're not the type of couple to ever ask for freebies - I even offered to pay for the wine, hoping to suggest that we were not inclined to pay for a meal after such a horrifying experience. To make matters worse, we saw the hair and the mouse after finishing eating. Had we seen it before gorging on food, we would have simply finished our wine and left. What an awful feeling to realize after ingesting an entire meal that your food was prepared in wholly unsanitary conditions - not to mention the kick in the face of shelling out $100+ after everything that happened.   This was a completely unacceptable meal experience. Before this all happened, we discussed possibly going back and/or taking friends or family but we will NEVER step foot in there again.

    "text": "My husband and I had reservations for dinner at 7:00 to celebrate Valentine's Day and one of our last dinners together for awhile since we have a baby on the way in a few weeks and a five year old at home so these date nights don't come to often. We arrived at 6:45 and were not seated until 7:45, which I'm not upset about because I was expecting a long wait for a busy night. The restaurant was packed which is understandable for Valentine's Day weekend so when we were seated right beside the entrance and where everyone was gathered waited to be seated, mind you it was 4 degrees out that night, I asked if we could possibly wait for another table elsewhere. We were told \"I assure you every table here is the same your food won't taste different elsewhere.\" So regretfully we sat there trying not to be a pain on such a busy night. Our whole dinner was interupred with people literally running right into our table or standing over top of us while they were waiting bumping into us the whole time or just staring at our every move, along with freezing when the door opened every few seconds. Our food was Cold bef ore it even made it into our mouths. We were told 6 times by different customers that they felt bad for where we were sitting. The food was good and our server was nice but finally having a night out and not even being able to hear eachother talk because of the large crowd next to us was very disappointing. It seemed like the servers only brought up the same 3 kinds of meat since we were in such a crowded hard to get area so when I asked for the bbq ribs on two different occasions they never came. I read on the review card to express your concerns before you leave the restaurant not in an email later so when I told the manager about our dinner he was distracted and simply said \"sorry\" and walked away. We paid the $120 For the nightmare dinner and went elsewhere to get dessert where we could be warm, hear eachother talk, and not be stared at the whole time. I then wrote an email to let them know about our experience since the manager did no seem concerned and my reply was that \"for special occasions they rent extra tables and place them where they have room. We must of got one of those tables. Sorry about our experience and offered us 10% off our next meal.\" No thank you we will not be returning.",

Something that our friend ate made her violently ill. She was unable to move from the table and was vomiting in a waste bucket that we were able to get to her in time. The manager came over at a loss, saying that he didn't know what to do in this situation. Our friend regains her composure and makes it to the bathroom and the server takes away the waste bucket but didn't have anyone mop up the floor which had vomit on it. When the check comes, our sick friend was still charged full price for a meal that made her ill. The situation was handled extremely poorly.",

We had walked past Texas de Brazil and thought it looked fun so we went in and it was packed and smelled delicious. We got a table within 5 minutes despite how crowded it was.  It was such a fun experience!!! Having the traditional gauchos come up to the table and offer you food was the highlight of my night. If you are a meat lover (like I am) this is absolutely the place for you. I tried a lot of everything to be honest. My favorite was the filet mignon and the lamb. If I'm not mistaken, you pay about $40 for an all you can eat. I definitely ate well over $40 in meat. They also have a great \"salad bar\" that is so much more! Imported meats cheeses breads roasted veggies!  Also, I have a severe peanut allergy that we told the hostess about. She was very nice about it and the manager met us at the table and guided me around the salad bar pointing out what I could and couldn't eat. The whole experience was memorable and a great way to celebrate my birthday",

When we arrived we were seated next to there wine cellar that is glassed in which created for the funniest moment of the night but ill get to that in a min. We started with the buffet which was very fresh but didn't have the largest selection which is ok with me because I would rather fill up on meat but I have to say I love beets with goat cheese and they had both so I was in heaven even before the steak. The meat for the most part was great. They prepaid it medium rare but will cook it however you like. As well if you find it to salty which I did not you can ask for it with no salt. The filet just melted in my mouth. This night they had top rib meat which I can't think of the technical name for but it was very fatty and after getting it on my plate I decided I would pass. I also have to compliment the meat guys they were all so good with my son as well as the rest of the wait staff. So many times while being out I've felt like restaurant staff have just dismissed him but I can't think of a single time when my son said something to a waiter or server that they didn't stop and acknowledge him. Now I will leave you with this. If siting by the glass wine seller keep your kids close because mine decided he wanted to check it out and ran right into the glass. Bryan and I laughed so hard. He didn't get hurt or anything and I don't think the table next to us even saw it but it was hilarious. This place is great for the whole family and the meat is amazing!!!!",

    "text": "After anxiously awaiting a new brazilian churrascaria, Hubs and I made reservations at TDB for restaurant week. The special was their typical buffet and meats with a dessert option or 35$. It was actually a pretty good deal and ened up saving us $30 total. Upon walking in, I was blown away by he size of this place. Gigantic. It was also very busy as there was a late aftenoon private game that had just ended. I'm glad we made reservations seeing there was an hour and a half wait!  We were quickly seated and the server helped us pick out a glass of wine. We were given a small bread basket with round, cheesy bread balls and were instructed to help ourselves to the appetizer buffet. The buffet has a selection of prepared salads, some seafood, meats and cheeses as well as greens/veggies to make a salad. After a quick salad, I was ready for the good stuff-the meats! Our server brought over our wine as well as fresh plates, a side of fried bananas to cleanse the palate and mashed potatoes. We turned our coaster to green and anxiously waited . . . and waited . . . and waited. We saw several skewers of meat come out of the kitchen but then they retuned to the kitchen area empty without coming anywhere near our table. I'm not sure if they didn't realize that we were waiting or if it was tso busy that they didn't make it to our table before running out but we missed many tasty looking meats. Our server stopped by to ask how it was going noticing our plates were empty. I explained the situation and within two minutes, the meat was exiting the kitchen in the opposite direction and headed toward our table. We tried the filet, ribs, lamb chops, leg of lamb, skirt steak, sirloin steak, rotisserie chicken, chicken wraped in bacon, parmesan crusted pork loin (my favorite) and plenty more. We lost track after 12 different meats. After having our fill, we both chose the banana foster pie for dessert. It too was so tasty and delicious. We left our meal feeling very pleased with the overall experience. My only criticism is that our other favorite churrascaria  (Green Forest) has a better appetizer buffet with a bigger selection of seafood items.",

If you have a group of picky eaters this is a definite crowd pleaser. Everything on the buffet is great, but I try to just go for the meat condiments and meat unless they have scalloped potatoes which are just so good. Service is perfect and you are often overwhelmed with food, but the whole environment is really fun. I wouldn't think that I would like a place with so much interaction (they bring the meat to your table and keep it coming), but I get excited anytime we are about to go. We do reserve for special occasions as it is pricey and ridiculously gluttonous. A meat splurge is best saved for a few times a year rather than a weekly hang out. ;)",

Before I tell you about my time here I'd like everyone to be aware they sell 2 $50 gift cards at Costco for $80, $20 savings! So, We came with a group of 6 & had to wait about 15-20 to be seated although we had a reservation. The place is EXTREMELY loud and very hard to have a decent conversation. In my opinion the tables are way too close together. In our 2 hours there my purse fell off my chair from people walking passed about 5-6 times. As far as food goes however the meats were excellent. Almost all their meat is cooked at medium rare-medium but they did offer to bring anyone's meat back to be cooked more if they wished for no pink.  There is a wide array of sides and appetizers to go along with every meat. While I did not like my drink (Tito sunrise) my friends sangria was delicious! Def. recommend. Good food? Yes. Would I go back? Ehhh...def. not on a Saturday.",

Entering the steak sanctuary I was telenovela by the incredible atmosphere and the positive energy of staff and patrons. The salad bar was well presented but lacked the selection of other Brazilian banquets I have been blessed to experience. I loved the hospitality of our server Eddie and his knowledge of the entire menu. Unfortunately things took a turn for the worse about halfway through our experience. The Gauchos turned into 'Gone'choes. I had to ask multiple times for our server and water guy to find some meat. Steelers fans at the table next to us are placing the magical green coasters on their forehead in an attempt to get someone, anyone's attention. After requesting our check, we had to wait nearly 30 mins. I really, really wish that they could have had the stamina to create a great experience from door to door. While there were good aspects of the experience, I struggle to give Texas De Bra'slow' more than two snail pace stars.",

    "text": "Technically, this should be no stars as it was so bad we didn't even make it to the food. My fiance and I went here tonight for a celebratory dinner. We were about 15 minutes early for our reservation and they weren't quite ready for us so we figured we'd grab a drink at the bar while we waited.   The bar was not very busy but it still took a surprising amount of time for the bartender to even acknowledge us. There were quite a few fruit flies buzzing around and when we finally ordered our drinks (both of which were from their cocktail menu - so things they SHOULD have had) I was told they didn't have the bourbon for the drink I ordered. Not a big deal as the bartender suggested a substitute, but it seemed like it was an inconvenience for her. She made my drink and part of my fiance's drink when she brought mine over and told my fiance that they were out of the lemonade for her drink. She then put mine down and walked away before we could order a different drink.  Eventually we did get a replacement drink order  but almost immediately noticed dead fruit flies in it. There were not only a few dead flies IN the drink, there were noticeable parts of flies floating ON it. When I pointed this out to the bartender she copped an attitude about it.  The drink had only had one sip taken from it so it's not like we were running a scam, but despite the large fly my fiance had fished out and dropped on a napkin the bartender still seemed fairly incredulous. The couple next to us wasn't having much luck either and at this point the meat they were bringing to the tables smelled odd and we just decided to leave (the table was also still not ready and we were now about 10 minutes past our reservation time). The bartender did eventually come back and made a big show of ripping up the old bill like she was doing us a favor by comping the one drink but really, rather than being proud of ripping up the old bill, she should have been embarrassed about serving a drink like that.  We left and told the hostess to go ahead and cancel the reservation on the way out. The hostess mentioned  that the table \"wasn't that far behind schedule\". We told her that wasn't why we were leaving and my fiance asked to speak to the manager. The hostess said the manager was unavailable as they were helping at the bar. We just laughed and left and will not be giving it a second try. If the bar is that dirty and generally bug infested, I can't imagine what the kitchen is like. No thank you!",

In Aruba, the service is exceptional, but I always assumed it was because we were at a tourist destination. The service at the Pittsburgh restaurant was also really great, which was a wonderful surprise. The staff would ask us often if there were any meats we were looking to try and would make sure a server with that meat stopped by our table. They also gave us tips on what sauces from the salad bar worked well with the meats. Our server that refilled our water, took our dirty plates, and handled our check, however, was not very good. He barely checked on us and we went a good 20 minutes with empty water glasses and when you're eating a lot of salty meats, that water is a must! He also acted really put-off by the fact that we asked for a split check since we were dining with another couple, which I thought was strange.  The meats are usually rare to medium, but you can ask for well done. There's a good variety of beef, chicken, pork, lamb, and sausage. My favorites were the garlic medallion steak and the Parmesan pork. They also serve fried bananas and mashed potatoes as side dishes for each table. In aruba, they serve fried plantains, which we liked better, but I guess if you're in the US they opt for banana. It was still good though. You can't really go wrong with a banana fried in cinnamon and sugar.  The salad bar has a great variety and also serves non-salad bar items like sushi. If you go with a group, you can opt to get just the salad bar and no meat for a reduced price.   My biggest complaint with the Pittsburgh location is they crammed way too many tables into the dining room. You're bumping into people non stop. They really need to remove some of the tables so that people can move around better and not feel cramped.",

They tell you straight up when you are seated how the meats are prepared. 2. if you want you meats prepared without salt, that can be done. You tell your waiter. It will take more time to prepare. That's on you.   If you're looking for a quiet spot, this isn't the place to go. If you're into a bustling atmosphere, make the trip.   Plenty to choose from at the salad bar. I will probably skip this next time and concentrate on crushing meats.",

    "text": "First time experience and it was good. I was highly impressed with there choices at the salad bar. So many choices and it was all very good. The meat choices were all good on an average. Some I didn't care for and some were good. The only choice that stood out for me was the garlic sirloin, which is odd for the cut of meat and what I usually prefer. This is my first experience at a Brazilian steakhouse so I have no comparisons, but the meat quality was average to good nothing special. I definitely will be bringing others back here every once in a while.  The only negative thing I can really say is the whole red/green card thing was a joke. They didn't follow that one bit and started asking us for meat as soon as we sat down eating our salads. it seemed like they ignored that and just brought us whatever meat based of the table next to us and what they were eating. It made it a little hard to enjoy when they showed up with 4 cuts of meat at once and nothing for 5  minutes. They could of done a better job a timing and spacing it out. It was like all or nothing it seemed. Overall that wouldn't prevent me from coming back.",

There are waiters walking all over the restaurant with different meat on skewers and they just cut it right then and there for you straight onto your plate. It's an all you can eat restaurant so pace yourself! When I was there, we had to wait at the bar for almost an hour to be seated, and this was with a reservation! Since we were seated so late, the restaurant emptied out a bit and a lot of the waiters with the skewers disappeared.. we had to ask our waiter multiple times to ask for more meat to come around. But then when it did, 3 /4 times it was bacon (and I don't eat bacon). Despite this, we filled up pretty quickly and so towards the end we didn't mind that the waiters weren't coming around anymore.",

The salad bar to start had cheeses, smoked salmon, shrimp, tabouli, crusty bread, etc. all gourmet, nothing done on the cheap. Soup of the day, lobster bisque was the best I've had in a long time. (No chunks of lobster, yet superbly delicious) the Churrassco(skewers of meat) were hot off the grill, perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. Service by Chris was exceptional and classy. Finished off with a perfect creme brulee. Lovely night and overall great experience!",

The service was superb but being on a cruise, we assumed it was due to their experience.    For my birthday, my husband surprised me with Pittsburgh's Texas de Brazil and scored total bonus points!  We don't eat red meat and we let them know ahead of time... not one gaucho came over to our table with red meat - it was fantastic!  It was really busy too so they were good.    The salad bar was much more than expected, I could probably get enough from that only but I would NEVER pass up on the meat.  The lobster bisque is amazing and I can't say that I will ever have a bowl as good as this!  A manager came over to check on us but wasn't annoying, simply cared how our experience was.  We loved it so much we went back the next week and the place isn't cheap!  That's about $200 in two weeks to eat here.  I don't regret it.  I'd do it again.    Make reservations online because they do get busy and also join their birthday club - one free meal!",

It may or may not have been related to the food. I will never try another Texas de Brazil and recommend you don't either.",

I'm not a huge meat-eater, so I liked that they had a salad bar with a ton of options (I'm a cheese and veggie person so I loved everything I tried).  I still appreciated their meat selection...the picanha was my favorite!  The fried banana sides were refilled pretty quickly both visits, which was all that was really important to me, so I thought the service was great.  The only things that I didn't really like was that I had to navigate my way through a maze of tables to get to the salad bar, so coming back with plates of food made me a little nervous that I might drop something, and our table was a too cramped for 4 people, especially with so many sides going around.  I would still eat here again for sure though!",

Our server, Ryan was welcoming, knowledgeable, professional and friendly throughout our meal. In terms of the food, I was a great fan of the salad bar and was particularly fond of the various fresh cheeses and marinated shrimp. We got two sides with our meal; I especially enjoyed the garlic mashed potatoes which I was sad to not have the stomach to finish. The core of the dinner was the AYCE meat (various types - my favorites were the parmesan chicken, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, and sausage) which I had my doubts about initially because I personally am not a fan of red or pink meat, and they mentioned that they cook the meats to default medium to medium rare. However, the meats I did try that did not fall under those categories were amazing and had perfect texture and juiciness. My boyfriend ate so many meats, several times to the point where he was stuffed and then past the point of being stuffed, after which he continued to say yes because, as he told me, \"it's just too good to say no to\". We had no room for dessert but ordered the chocolate mousse cake to-go which was amazing as well.",

Do yourself a favor and grab a tiny bowl and get a delicious sauce or two to dip your meat in. (My favorite was the chimichuri with my steaks, and the roasted garlic on the warm bread). The sushi was surprisingly very good!  Not to be missed, the lobster bisque! Oh man....so delicious, and in a buffet environment no less! I've had a lot of lobster bisques, and this one is definitely tops! Also....au gratin potatoes. Try some, do it - maybe mix in some of that roasted garlic too!  Okay, so everyone goes here for the meats and I can definitely see why. They make it easy for newbies and you get a red/green sign to signal the servers to stop by, but really they were all asking regardless if it was red (pass for now). I was partial to the beef cuts, but the chicken and sausages were acceptable. After a few bites of sausage, the salty factor caught up to me and it was no longer enjoyable. If dining with others, perhaps split a portion your served, that way you can sample more and decide what tastes best for you. My husband I used this method and we were able to sample almost everything we wanted, and then some.  Worth the hype, and at the price I could not have asked for better cooked steak. You definitely get what you pay for. Utilize the reservation feature on their website!",

    "text": "We have been going to Texas de Brazil since it opened at Station Square in Pittsburgh. It was always our go-to restaurant for birthdays, celebrations & Mother's Day. We've always had fantastic service, the food was hot & delicious with a lot of variety & the overall experience was always wonderful.   This time, we went on Mother's Day & it was quite possibly one of the worst dining experiences I've had in years. We had a reservation for a specific time & they left us (including my elderly mother) standing at the hostess station for over 25 minutes. They weren't updating us with how soon our table would be ready & when I would ask them, they acted like they were doing me a favor. All 3 front desk employees were rude & none of them had a smile on their faces. When they seated us 25 minutes late, there was no apology for the wait and no explanation.  Once we were seated, it took a very long time for the server to take our order. She was nice'ish (when we actually saw her), but she did not pay much attention to us because we weren't a large party. My son's drink was empty for about 15 minutes, and we kept trying to get her attention for a new drink, and no, it wasn't a free refill type of beverage. She was at the table right next to us twice and didn't even look up or over at us. We did not feel like valued guests at all.    The cheese biscuits, one of our favorite things, were cold & hard as rocks & the selection of meats was minimal. We are used to having at least 10 different types of meats, and this time, we were offered maybe 4.   We still tipped our server more than 20% because, coming from the hospitality industry, I know how challenging a holiday can be. However, her service left a lot to be desired & frankly, I don't think I saw her smile even once. It actually seemed like almost every employee was miserable, unhappy & hated their jobs. The only exception was the men who came around with the meats. They were friendly, professional & seemed happy.   I'm really disappointed in the downward turn this restaurant has taken because we absolutely used to love it. I hope management can shake things up & bring this restaurant back to what it used to be. There is absolutely no reason we should have had this terrible of an experience. We are not hard to please & always give the benefit of the doubt. There was so much room for improvement, and we were really disappointed. We will not return until we've heard improvements have been made. And I plan on sharing with my friends who like to go there as well on special occasions that our experience was awful.",

We get to the restaurant and we had to wait 15 minutes before being seated. What is the point of making a reservation if I'm not going to be seated right away? I'm usually a pretty patient person but I made an early reservation because we had to get to my graduation. I felt like I was in the Seinfeld episode where he makes a reservation for a rental car and when he gets there, they don't have any cars left for him. And he said exactly what I said, \"That's why you make a reservation. What is the point of making a reservation if it's not going to be ready for when you arrive?\"  Our server Alina was doing the best that she could for us. It was pretty busy, but she was really knowledgeable and a great server. It's not her fault that the bread isn't ready. But everyone was just really behind! Even the meat people hardly came around initially, maybe once or twice within the first 30 minutes of our arrival. We saw meat people going to tables nearby us but never in our section; we weren't the only table having this issue. Our bread didn't come until half way through our meal, along with the mashed potatoes. Our water cups were almost always empty. Service and meat picked up towards the end of our meal, but by that time we were already full from the cold bar and we also needed to leave if I wanted to get to my graduation on time.  The food was delicious but the service honestly sucked. And a place this freaking expensive should have both good food AND good service. It was really irritating knowing that my family asked to go somewhere nice for graduation and they paid so much money for such annoyingly slow service.  Overall for the price, it was a really disappointing evening and experience.",

The drawback came when you are waiting for the servers with the meat. We waited at least 5-10 minutes if not longer for a meat server. Most of the beef was fatty. I requested chicken which came around later and was wrapped in bacon. That's good if you like bacon. Honestly, I will not hurry back.",

Decided to take my step daughter here for her birthday . My husband called to reserve a table . Whomever answered the phone was rude and impatient . Told my husband since it was a Saturday and we wanted to reserve at 6 pm to just come in . They would not reserve. And the wait could be until 9 pm! So we drove over . At the hostess booth there were three women . I asked them if we could be seated , they declined, I looked around and saw several open tables but they insisted there was a waiting list we needed to get on and the wait was a hour or more .  Don't get me wrong .. the food IS good . I just assumed since I had such a wonderful experience on my birthday , that my stepdaughter would have one as well . We went to dine elsewhere . Wish the staff could be more accommodating . Considering the amount of money we leave here ( AND we're GREAT tippers!)",

    "text": "This place has definitely gone downhill, which is surprising to me. My family and I came here for dinner last night. We made a reservation, which was recommended and we still had to wait for our table. I wasn't sure why we had to wait because there were plenty of open tables around the restaurant. Once we were seated, our waiter came over to take our drink order. Our table of 5 all ordered waters and you could see on his face that he was annoyed that we didn't order any soft drinks or alcohol. I honestly made me feel weird that he reacted like that.   Anyways, the salad bar was well stocked, so that's a plus. However they don't have nearly as much variety as other Brazilian restaurants around the city.   Another flaw of the evening was how infrequent the waiters came around offering meat options. When they did come around, it was almost always the same 3 things.   Our waiter hardly ever came back to check on us or refill our glasses during dinner. However, when it was time to pay, be picked up our check very quick.   I've been to Texas de Brazil plenty of times before, but something was definitely off last night. The only reason I would come back here would be for the lamb chops- they literally are out of this world amazing - but very hard to track them down throughout your meal.",

The food was great but the waiters to bring the meat to your plate kept skipping our table. We kept flagging people down to try to get them to come to our table, our waitress that did our drinks and whatnot kept flagging them down and the still kept skipping us. Our check was $90 (after a coupon was used) and we left still hungry because we couldn't get food to our table. It was absolutely ridiculous. I've had better service from Bob Evans or McDonald's even! Will take something very big to get us to go back.",

    "text": "I visited for a friend's birthday during restaurant week. This was my second time coming to a Brazilian steakhouse, so I knew what to expect. The salad bar was quite good and the selection was great. I really liked their sushi, the scalloped potatoes, and their rice and beans. The meat was good as well, however nothing blew me away. One piece of meat was so chewy and did not break down at all, so I literally could not swallow it. The employees who were bringing the meat around didn't give you any options in terms of cooking preferences (rare, medium rare, etc.) which surprised me as I did have this option at the other steakhouse I visited. We had a large party and the server did a great job with keeping up with the drink orders, and bringing us all of our desserts (which was part of the restaurant week deal). The dessert was ok- I had the key lime pie, which was decent, but nothing to write home about. There was one thing that seemed to upset a lot of people at our table and something that should be noted for future guests. Since it was restaurant week, the meal was cheaper than it normally would be and also came with a dessert. A lot of the guests at our table brought gift cards to pay for their meal- some of which were from Costco and Sam's Club (the white gift cards). I also had a gift card, but mine was a black gift card (purchased at Giant Eagle). The server notified us when we asked for our bills that they could not accept the white gift cards, as those cannot be combined with any other discount. The black gift cards were acceptable to use. This upset a lot of people at our table, because there was no signage posted about this and no one had notified them until the end of their meal. Had they had known about this before, they wouldn't have ordered the dessert, since they had to pay for that out of pocket in order to use their gift cards. They had used these gift cards many times prior at this restaurant, and did not realize that restaurant week would change anything.   Overall, our meal was ok, but I wouldn't come back and pay full price. Perhaps my experience wasn't so ideal because it was restaurant week and busier than normal, which I can understand, but I'm still not sure if I will run back here any time soon.",

For dinner you have two options-- the full dinner or the salad bar only. I wouldn't recommend skipping the meat, but you can absolutely have a good meal at the salad bar. It has plenty of options-- including some seafood-- and everything tasted great.  There was a wide variety of meat, and it was fun to sample a little bit of everything. The bacon-wrapped filet was amazing, and so was the sausage.  My boyfriend has a peanut/tree nut allergy, and we were offered our choice of a couple different complimentary dessert options that he could eat safely (flan, creme brulee).",

We finally had to ask our waiter if we could try a few things since it never came to our side. The meat needed more seasoning. When they did come to our table it was the same things.  It was not worth the money. Now, I know.",

If you enjoy eating meat, this place is your dream come True!  As long as you have your coaster flipped to green, the meat just keeps coming to you! They have a large variety to choose from. From various cuts of steak, sausage, pork, chicken, and ribs.   The salad bar is a trap. There are so many delicious options on the salad bar! I think they are trying to get you to eat as much as possible from the salad bar so you eat less meat. But hey it's a good strategy!  My personal favorites are the house picanha and the lamb! The flavor is perfect and it is very juicy! I also really enjoyed the bananas that they bring out to your table. I can never get enough of those!  If you leave hungry, it's definitely your fault!",

    "text": "Meat? Unlimited you say? Brb making a reservation now..  This was my second visit at Texas de Brazil. I could write a run down of all the meats I tried but that'd be a bit overboard. It was super busy on the Friday night I visited, on top of that it was also Restaurant Week ($35, regularly $45).  FOOD: Ugh so delicious. Salad/sides bar was solid too. I always stock up on the asparagus and some greens to make me feel better about eating a village's worth of beef. Filet mignon and top sirloins were solid. I'd like to say that the BBQ brisket was not so great and the sauce was overpoweringly sweet (I'm a Kansas City girl, I just couldn't say no to trying BBQ in the Burgh). After awhile even though the flavor is good, you get sick of eating beef after two hours (yes we sat there for almost two hours, oops). Had to pass on dessert as I was slowly slipping into a food coma in my seat. My first visit I did get creme brulee, and it tasted awfully \"egg-y\", not representative of a good creme brulee :(.   SERVICE: At first, it was slow as the beef took awhile to come out as I sat there with my little indicator on green impatiently waiting to feed my red meat addiction. They would come out with sausages or chicken, but my eyes and heart were set on some top sirloin and filet mignons. We were seated in a spot where they would usually come to us first out of the kitchen, and while you might think that's a great thing, my boyfriend commented on how we got the kind of burnt/too crispy outsides of meat.   I smell like beef..",

Balsamic onions, roasted garlic cloves, and a nice selection of cheeses just to name a few, enhanced the flavors of the meat. While potatoes, beans and rice provided the starch component. I had heard bad things about the speed of the servers and the quality of the service. I want to say my experience was the exact opposite. My server? Awesomeness! The speed of the carvers was great.

I wouldn't of had to ask her that, if the staff that carried the meat wouldn't of skipped our table most of the time.  It was happy hour when I went. They had a sign outside of the restaurant telling me so. So when I asked for a drink, the waitress said, \"sorry thats only at the bar\". I said ok, can I go get a drink at the bar and bring it back here? She said no. I mean really?!   The Green Forest was a much better experience. It had more cuts of meat, at a better cook temp.

All the meat was cooked perfectly at medium rare. My husband had a few pieces which were a little less than medium rare and he loved it. We were so full, we only ate a few bites of the carrot cake for dessert but it was the best we ever had.  Our server Ashley was attentive, helpful and very sweet.   Overall, it was a fabulous dinner and we will definitely return.",

The servers kept our plates stacked and wetter all very nice.  Once they notice we slowed done they asked what we wanted and I was able to end with a plate of filet mignon.  Great night.",

    "text": "This is not my favorite Brazilian steakhouse, but it's a Brazilian steakhouse so it's pretty good. The price is standard around $45 per person. It includes all the meat you can eat and a salad bar. Atmosphere is decent tho it can get loud. The waitstaff is friendly and most of all the meat is delicious.  My only complaint about the set up is the salad bar, it's very tight two people cant fit side by side so it's a bit tricky to get your cheese and salads. That's not a terrible thing though as you should concentrate on the meat anyway it what you paid for.   The meat is always on the rarer side but that's standard for these types of restaurants... You can ask for meat more well done and they will accomidate you",

I went with my niece (who has never been before), her husband (who has been to several locations, as well) and their sons.  Everyone had a good time. The Boys were in heaven.   They have done a great job with this location. The service was outstanding. We were taken care of without feeling smothered. The flow of the meat and the knowledge of the servers was great. They took time to explain what they were serving and finding out the favorites.  Our main waiter, Jonathon, was attentive and friendly. He took time to make the 'newbies' feel welcome.   The salad bar is worth the price of admission, but the different meats is the reason we all come.  They were all prepared perfectly.  The Boys loved anything wrapped in bacon (and who can blame them).  Even dessert was amazing - save room for the Bananas Foster Pie.   Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "I'm torn on how to review this restaurant. Given the lack of choices in da Burgh for Brazilian steakhouses, I might rate it 3 stars. Compared to other Texas de Brazil locations I have tried, this restaurant rates 1 star. Over all, I decided to average it out at 2. It isn't at all bad, but it should be much better.  Other reviews have covered the experience so I'll stick to what didn't work, and then mention the things that did.  The salad bar is nice, but not half the size of what is normally offered at a Texas de Brazil. I will sometimes opt for just the salad bar, but this one doesn't have the selection. Usually I would tell vegetarians they could eat here and be happy, I'm not sure I would recommend this location.  Meat is the star of the show. It was sadly lacking here. The meat we got was good, but they had maybe half as many gauchos as normal. The experience is supposed to be like a meat parade - the meat comes in so many cuts and options, and so fast, that you can't keep up, and very quickly have to flip your card over to say you've had enough, at least for now. Here that never happened. The meats came around so infrequently we nearly always sat with an empty plate before the next gaucho came around.   Of the advertised cuts of meat, we saw just about half in the time we were there. Usually picanha is rotated through frequently, but here it came by only twice. Flank and leg of lamb came by once. We were offered filet, chicken, and sausage many times.  Also, at the beginning they ask if there is any specific cut you like, and we said beef ribs, which is our favorite. When we were ready to leave, they still had not come out so we asked again. They did come out, but the meat was dried out and not very appetizing.   High points were my caipirinha, the lobster bisque, and I'll give them bonus points for the fact three different people asked us if we liked our table or if we would like to move.   The experience was summed up by my boyfriend asking at the end of the meal if I could take him someplace else for his birthday, since this wasn't quite what he was hoping for.",

    "text": "My favorite restaurant of all time is \"Green Forest\". So I was slightly disappointed when I came to Texas de Brazil. Although Texas de Brazil did somethings better than Green forest.  First I wanted to talk about what I did like. I liked the table, I liked my waitress, and the restaurant has a great salad bar. I think the salad bar was genius; they have dishes that someone wouldn't typically get. This is to reel you in to what else your about to eat.   Then Texas de Brazil does a slight left ...then a detour through average city. This is where it loses a star for me, as Green Forest has a bigger selection and the meat taste better. This is to be expected as this is a branch. But I felt like there was only 5-6 meats going around.  This place got a seal of approval. Probably a better place to start out and try Brazilian food. But Green Forest wins by a landslide.",

There's benches everywhere so you can sit, relax and enjoy the fresh... smell of Joe's crab shack nearby (not complaining). There is also a fountain in this area but it wasnt turned on.   We made a reservation for 5 through google. We arrived went in 5mn before and was seated immediately. They were extremely busy for an early Sunday evening.   The food was great, the servers were all awesome, and the overall experience was well worth the price.   The reason for the -1 star is because they have a salad bar but I was unable to find things to put on the salad (i.e. tomatoes, cheese, carrots, cucumbers, etc). I'm not sure if I overlooked it, but I walked around the salad bar a few times before settling on a salad with only ranch and a plate of a variety of sides they had available.",

    "text": "I tried again.  Again, Texas de Brazil failed.  A couple of my co-workers and I wanted to try Texas de Brazil for restaurant week - so reservations were made.  The day of the reservation, i got a call confirming the reservation, asking if we were celebrating anything, etc.  I confirmed that we were coming for restaurant week - but that was all.  Once we arrived, we confirmed - again that we were there for restaurant week, once seated - we again, confirmed to our waiter that we were there for restaurant week.  We were sitting in dreadful seats.  For an hour - all that came to our table was the same pork 4 times and the same chicken dish - 3 times.  We had alerted our waiter.  We even tried to flag down the RED meat.  I get that they potentially have sections that they cover.  Maybe our section isn't in a specified section.  We - on purpose - finally sat with empty plates and timers going on our phones.  It was comical at that point.    20 minutes after we had notified our waiter that we had only been getting pork and chicken, someone came by with a different meat.  Yipee!  Then - another 20 minutes went by before we could get another sword of food.    While we didn't get the food we wanted, we were ready to leave.  Our bills came.  I have dined at Texas de Brazil for restaurant week multiple times.  I have never had to notify my waiter that I am there for restaurant week to get the restaurant week pricing.  So imagine our surprise when our bills were regular pricing!  Once we found our waiter again, told him of the error - he came back threw the bills on our table.  Not just nicely set them down - threw.    It was yet again not a good experience.  I want to enjoy Texas de Brazil...but it seems to just...I don't know - disappoint.",

There are different types of cheese, sausages, fish, spreads and they where all dellicious. The meat was great too. We tried less types because we don't eat pork. Our waiter Donald was very professional and nice. Oh and the FRIED BANANAS were soo good. As you sit down waiting for the meat to be prepared you can go ahead and take whatever you want from the salad bar, but if you are not a big steak fan you cand just eat from the salad bar and you also pay less.  They are going to explain everything when you enter the restaurant. Try it you will not regret it! P.s a little tip: desserts are brought to you at the end of the dinner, they are not included in the menu price. We where full but got them to go not knowing they are extra. They are ok, not great.",

    "text": "This is a fun place to go for a celebration! We came here for my boyfriend's birthday. He had never been to a Brazilian steakhouse before so I knew he was in for a treat.   We made a reservation and were sat promptly. I think it is good that we decided to make a reservation, because even though it was a Monday, it was still fairly busy inside for some reason. Our waitress greeted us promptly. I don't think we got a great explanation (hard to hear, and clearly rushed), so thankfully I had eaten at one before and could walk him through what to do to supplement. She recommended a wine to us, which we decided to try. It was newly imported from California, and delicious! We ended up getting another bottle.   We started with the salad bar, which is way better than any other salad bar you've ever seen. So many different choices... I think we went a little crazy at first piling everything on our plate! From soup, fish, salad ingredients, sides, etc, it had so much!  Once we sat down, the wine was brought over and we began our dinner. There are people who walk around with meat on skewers and approach your table and ask if you want what they have. You can always say no. We found that often times the meat we actually wanted (shrimp, sirolins, etc) tended to not get to our tables. Thankfully, when our server came back, she hunted down someone with the shrimp and he was able to bring us more.   Everything was delicious! Great experience. Definitely come prepared to drop some $$$",

    "text": "My friends and I recently treated ourselves to a night out, and it was an experience, to say the least. We arrived approximately 20 minutes earlier than I our 5pm reservation, therefore we were seated at the bar to wait. Conveniently, happy hour had already begun so we enjoyed $5 cocktails while waiting. I personally indulged in the Rio Sunrise which I ordered again later in the night before happy hour concluded.   When we first arrived, the place was almost completely empty except for a couple seated at the bar. Initially, it didn't make sense why we couldn't be seated our table with so every table open, but once dinner began, it suddenly made sense.   At 5pm, we were taken to our table where we were able to stretch out and get comfortable. Our server promptly asked if anyone had been here before to which we all replied: no. He explained how everything worked and welcomed us to the salad bar. His explanation of everything got us even more excited for what was to come.   We made our way through the salad bar which was full of pleasantries including spanish cheese, sushi, lobster bisque, and so much more. I tried to get small portions of everything knowing all that all that meat would be coming soon in addition to fried plantain and mashed potatoes. I enjoyed mostly everything I got from the salad bar including the lobster bisque. It had nice flavor, but I also expected it to be thicker.   Then the meats came and kept on coming! One after the other: sausages, porks, steaks, chickens--you name it. The servers were very  patient in waiting to see who actually wanted their selection off the 2ft skewer. They took survey and then made their way around our table. They would either drop the meat onto our plates or instruct us to grab our personal tongs.   I quickly had a few favorites including the spicy sirloin and lamb. Lamb ended up being a table favorite. Our server had the lamb and spicy sirloin sent back to our table after the first couple rounds. After awhile, I had to turn my little card over to red so that I could eat what was in front me. Know that if you're like me and you like your meat well done, you can just let each of the servers know. Ever so often, I'd use the fried plantain to cleanse my palate. Not really; that's what it was for but it was also just so delicious!   After we we just about full and our table mostly cleared. Our server brings over a tray full of cake and pie slices. Game Over! You're never too full for dessert! I had the carrot cake and regretted nothing!   I don't think I've ever left a restaurant so full and satisfied not only with the food but also the service. We all had agreed that our only 'good' service in comparison to 'excellent' service was the hostess. Everyone else more than made up for them with their smiles, patience, desire to serve and knowledge. This meal was a whopping $44 not including my drinks and dessert, but well worth it in my book.",

Seated quickly by a friendly host, we were warmly welcomed and she explained how they do things. Then we began! Terrific salad bar and soups! Well presented with delicious options! My 12 year old boy loved the (Diablo styled?) shrimp and bisque, as did I. Then came the meats. Hoo boy...my son! Ever see a ravenous 12 year old growth spurting wild man in his carniverous element? There he was...and good heavens did he eat! Smiling between the samples steadily offered by serving staff constantly on the march about...he was as happy as I was with the great quality and varieties of offerings. Marvelous! Oh...and the potatoes, bread and (yummy!) bananas with cinnamon...wow! WOW! Great waitstaff. Great food. Great place! A must stop...and often!",

    "text": "If you haven't tried a Brazilian steakhouse, you really should. They have employees in traditional garb walking around with big skewers of meat that they cut right on to your plate. They have lamb, beef, pork, and chicken. There's a bunch of different cuts and they can slice you a portion in whatever temperature you like. There's also a cold bar with various charcuterie, cheeses, sauces, oils, and vegetables (I must have eaten a full pound of nova lox with capers and goat cheese).  For dinner it is $45 for access to the meat and cold bar, and you can certainly get your money's worth.  I do however have a few criticisms. Some of the meats are smaller than you might expect (although you can certainly get more than one piece). The lamb chops and fillet mignon are on the smaller side. After my table paid we stayed for about 30 minutes and our waters were not refilled although our glasses were empty.",

It looks from the outside a larger restaurant, but when you walk inside it really isn't, but it makes up for it in hospitality and excellent food. I enjoyed the salad bar, the Lobster Bisque, and all the delicious meat and poultry brought to the table.  Highly recommended and will visit again !!",

Then proceeded to the salad bar that had endless possibilities. Our waitress brought the garlic mashed potatoes, fried cinnamon bananas, and cheesy bread. The bread was like a magic cheesy cloud!! We never even made it to the hot food bar as the meats just kept coming. We had a great table close to the kitchen which gave us prime choosing of first cuts. Our favorites were definitely the flank steak, sirloin, and Brazilian sausage.  Although the lamb chops were close behind. We would absolutely dine again.

We started off with salad and got some sides  and then the meat just started coming.   After about three stops from the meat cutters, I was pretty much done. My boyfriend kept eating because he really does love meat especially red meat. And it's not like this place is cheap, you want to get your money's worth.  I ended up getting a few more cuts of meat for myself . I love the fact that the meat is fresh and warm and cut right in front of you. I love knowing where the food is coming from. The young men cutting are super nice and definitely make the experience fun.   I finished my meal as I always do with dessert. It was cheesecake and it was huge and very good. Overall I would say yes to this place as you understand what you are getting .",

    "text": "I went here for a friend's birthday and there were 15-20 of us. We had a reservation which is a must here, they were crowded! This was my first time here and I wish I did some research because I did not go in hungry which was my main mistake but wanted to celebrate pre-bar with friends anyway. (It was a busy weekend and had multiple outings earlier in the day). This was actually my first time at a Brazilian steakhouse so I had no idea what it was like. However, I was pleasantly surprised so maybe my review is nice for a newcomer's take?  Anyway, they give you a circle card that you flip to green when you are ready to try meats and flip to red/the other side when you do not want them to come to your table anymore. There are several men that come by each table with different cuts of meat: sirloin wrapped in bacon, filet minion, lamb, pork, ribs - just every type of meat you could ask for. They do also cook medium rare - well done and the waitress did check what we prefer. We first went to the salad bar which if you are unfamiliar like I was - it is not your average salad bar - it has fish, shrimp, salads, fruit, curry style dishes, soups, bread, etc (a lot of variety). I think it is good to know to be very light with the salad bar so you have room for the meats. The meats are literally mouthwatering - the lamb stood out the most for me, very tender and juicy. I really cannot wait to go back and the next time I will be sure to come on an empty stomach to get my money's worth and enjoy more meats. I think it was just as exciting just watching them cut the meat as it was eating it.  There is a salad bar only option (which is nice for vegan and vegetarian friends) which is $24.99, the salad bar and meats is $54.99. It is pricey but if you go in hungry it is worth every penny for the quality and quantity that is available. My main tip is to not drink alcohol there - go to a bar post-dinner as their drinks are very pricey and would probably cost you nearly your meal in order to get a buzz.   The only downfall to our visit was our waitress was a little scatterbrained and actually told us she \"got lost\" with which tables were hers and we had to wait a bit to even get drinks refills or have her get our checks. Granted it was a busy Saturday night and I am not sure if she was maybe new but the meat servers were much more well deserving of our tips than our waitress was.  **I did take photos of the meat and videos of it being cut but it is hard to get good photos with the lighting in there. Yelp didn't let me add the videos! I guess I was more preoccupied eating it.",

Texas de Brazil was able to accommodate our party of 4 despite not having reservations. There was a 45 minute wait but we had a few drinks at the bar and our table was ready well before the quoted 45 minutes. I ordered a strawberry caipirinha and it was very sweet, but tasty nonetheless.   Compared to the competitors in the area, Texas de Brazil probably has the best salad bar. There are a lot more options here. I was also pleasantly surprised that they didn't limit the meat options during restaurant week because my experience at another churrascaria, they limited the options when the price was discounted. We had delicious lamb, filet mignon, bacon covered filet, you name it! I didn't find the meat to be over-seasoned and everything tasted great! Also loved the cheese bread and fried bananas!",

    "text": "VERDICT:  A dizzying array of grilled meats and a very well stocked salad bar (available by itself, too) make this a worthy destination for carnivores and  non-carnivores alike.  SERVICE:  I've had mixed results here, ranging from good to sub-par. It seems to depend on the server, their level of knowledge, and how busy it is. On the whole, it's on the slow side, with longer than necessary waits for non-buffet items (drinks, sides, desserts). The manager did recognize me on my repeat visits though, and made it a point to come over and welcome me back, which I appreciated.  FOOD:  For those unfamiliar with the Rodizio/Churrascaria concept, diners pay a fixed price (comparable to what you'd pay for a steak entree at an upscale steakhouse) for an all-you-can-eat array of seasoned grilled meats. The meats are brought out from the kitchen on skewers and portions are carved off directly at your table and onto your plate. You can indicate whether you want the servers to come around again by flipping an indicator at your table from red to green.  TdB is worth the price of admission for the lamb alone. Lamb still isn't on the menu at too many restaurants, and over here, it's prepared beautifully, both as chops and as leg of lamb. Try it with the mint jelly from the salad bar and you won't be disappointed. If lamb isn't your thing, fear not - you could always get the chicken parm, flank steak, sausage, ribs, sirloin, or a variety of meats wrapped in bacon, including a bacon wrapped filet. And then there are those delicious warm biscuits.  If it all seems a little overwhelming, I'd skip the ribs and the filet mignon. There are  restaurants and steakhouses a plenty that serve these items, and frankly, do a better job of it. The parmesan crusted chicken isn't particularly noteworthy either. To get the biggest gastronomical bang for my buck, I'd concentrate on the lamb, the flank steak (goes great with the potatoes), the sausage, and the Picanha, which is the house specialty. Picanha is a steak cut popular in Brazil, similar to Top Sirloin, which is how it is sometimes referred to here. At TdB, they have it available seasoned with garlic and without. Despite my love of garlic, I preferred the non-garlic version for its subtler flavors.  Every dinner also includes the salad bar, which puts anything at other chain establishments to shame. In addition to salad of course, there are soups, sushi, cured meats, cheeses, and fruit. In fact, it's tempting to fill up on the salad bar alone. Fortunately for those of us who want to do just that, or are vegetarian/pescatarian, the salad bar is also available by itself for a lower price.   AMBIANCE: TdB's location in Station Square gives it a festive vibe, especially on the two or three days a year when Pittsburgh has nice weather. The decor of the restaurant itself is a bit garish and the lighting could stand to be a not quite so bright, but aside from that, still reasonably upscale - think birthday dinner, not anniversary.  BOTTOM LINE:  What's not to like about unlimited beef, chicken, pork and lamb? Until and unless a Fogo de Chao opens in Pittsburgh, this remains a better bet than the past-its-prime Green Forest churrascaria in Penn Hills.",

The food was great.....when it came around.  There were many times we had clean plates waiting for someone to come around with more meat.  While the salad bar was always stocked I did not come here to spend $29.99 to eat salad. Our server was OK, nothing spectacular and by no means a ball of fire.  The last Brazilian steakhouse I ate at, the waiter was always bringing clean plates and taking away dirty ones.  We had to go to the salad bar for clean plates several times and the dirty ones sat on our table for quite a while before they were taken away.  Our waiter never once brought clean plates or  brought out more bread.   All in all for the price we paid, it was an ok experience, however next time I am going to spend that kind of money, I will go to the Cheesecake Factory.",

We gave them a second chance, thinking the previous time was an off night.  The following time it was worse.  We were seated by the entrance door, and most of the meats that came out of the kitchen, were snatched up by other diners, before they made it to our table.  The only thing arriving at our table were the less popular meats, and these took 10-15 minutes between meats, to arrive.  (we timed them).  We mentioned this to our waiter, which to his credit, I believe passed the message on, but to no avail.  The manager finally came over and assured us more meats would be coming soon, but we had lost our appetites by then.  Another note:  The Brazilian sausage that we love, was replaced by, (I kid you not), what looked and tasted like Hillshire Farm, grocery store sausage.  I'm not sure if they didn't get their regular shipment of sausage meat, and had to resort to this, but it was sad and insulting that they tried to pass this off as a normal offering.  We still have a $50 gift card for this restaurant, but will most likely try to sell this to someone else to use.  We can't risk getting burned a third time.",

    "text": "We went to this restaurant for a 7:00 dinner during Restaurant Week. This was the first time I'd ever been to a Brazilian churrascaria, and maybe I'm just easily impressed, but I LOVED this place.  We probably had to wait 5-10 minutes to be seated even though we had a reservation. It seemed like the restaurant is understaffed, as there was only one host and a manager was running around trying to help her out. It then took a good few minutes for one of the servers to take our drink order, but after that everything picked up in speed.  The website indicates the dress code is business or smart casual, but I saw a few dudes there in Harley tees, so it seems like basically anything goes. My husband and I were dressed in nice jeans and a blazer and a more casual dress, respectively, and didn't feel out of place.  I was kind of preparing to be disappointed with the meal, to be honest. Reading the selection of meats that are unlimited in your experience, I thought it was going to be a too good to be True situation.  It wasn't. Everything was delicious.   They serve all red meat medium rare, and being someone who usually orders meat cooked medium well, I was a little hesitant. I shouldn't have been. If you like your meat well done, tell the server and they will cut it from the outside, where it is cooked more thoroughly. I didn't bother requesting this though because I found that most of the meat was only a bit pinker that I am normally used to, but I enjoyed it just the same. The fillets were all cooked medium to medium well and are juicy but not bloody.   Yes, the meat is salty. I am a bit of a salt-a-holic, so it was just about perfect for me. That being said, by the end of the meal my lips did feel a little weird from eating all the salt!  My husband's favorite was the bacon wrapped fillet, I loved the house special, and our servers stopped by multiple times to ask if we wanted those cuts sent back over. As the staff mentions, any one of them is at your service. If you see any server, you can ask them for more plates, specific meats, drinks, water, dessert, even your check. They all work together and it seems to be a good system given the nature of the restaurant.  The salad bar looked delicious but I didn't take very much from it on this trip. I'm a red meat fan and was gearing up to a eat a lot of it, so I skipped things I would have otherwise enjoyed. Before coming to the restaurant, I couldn't imagine paying $25.00 just for the salad bar, but after seeing what it contains: sushi, salmon, greens, soup, rice, potatoes and your more standard salad items, I might just consider it.  We took our deserts to go--I was happy that the let us, some restaurants can be a bit strict during restaurant week promotions--key lime pie was awesome.  The meal was delicious, but if you eat the way we did, I can't imagine frequenting this place very often.",

We were seated immediately at a quiet table in the corner overlooking the restaurant so we had a great view of everyone and could see where all the meats were at! Our waiter Raymond was on point!! He totally made out visit! The meats were cooked to a medium rare perfection. The lamb was out of this world with their mint jelly. Raymond made us a topping of rice, beans and Brazilian vingerette which again was quite tasty! The salad bar options ranged from traditional Brazilian to Japanese to American. Totally something eh for everyone. We passed on the desserts because none of them were too appealing after such an amazing dinner.",

They will bring around huge skewers of perfectly cooked meat. The waiter will also bring fried banana as a palate cleanser and garlic mashed potatoes probably to fill your stomach. They also have a huge \"salad bar\" with sushi, cheeses, vegetables, and soups.  They have a large selections of wine available by glass or bottle.  The price is pretty steep but you will get your money's worth. We paid about 50$ per plate.  This would be a great place for a special event.  Will definitely come here again!",

I had been to a Brazillian bbq out in orlando a few years back so I knew these things existed and the charm of the place.  With their restaurant week deal, I could not pass up on the opportunity (it was 35 plus tax and tip for unlimited salad bar/meats and a choice of dessert) - still expensive but definitely better than the regular price.  The salad bar was good, I would have expected a little more variety but oh well. The meats were delicious. I loved the leg of lamb and the lamb chops. The brazilian sausage was another good piece of meat as well. The pecan pie hit the spot at the end.  I am not lying when I say I did not eat anything until dinner the next day. I stuffed myself. It was a great experience (but being frugal and a grad student, I don't think I could go here often) - nonetheless, I will be back to devour some glorious food.  (We visited the bar but it seemed a bit overpriced for our taste so we didn't really get anything)  The servers and the people walking around with the skewers were very cordial as well and answered any questions quickly.",

It's a Brazilian churrascaria  which really means it's a Brazilian cowboy barbecue. Sounds simple enough but it's better!!!  This is an all you can eat monster meat bonanza like nothing you have experienced before unless you've eaten here. It's an all you can eat buffet but here's the twist... servers walk around with sword like skewers full of the best cuts of meat cooked to perfection. You have a little disk you flip over from red for no I'm good to green which is load me up with meat. This is the highlight of this wonderful place to eat. That isn't to take away from the salad bar which has many great items itself such as the prosciutto or the awesome cheeses. Did I also mention that yes they also have a full service bar that is spot on!",

    "text": "Honestly wanted to give this place a 4-star rating, but in the end decided against it. As like many of restaurants of its type, there are two options: either full bar or salad bar only. Though most people who come here would probably find this place pretty dope in terms of a relatively plentiful selection of meats, salad bar offerings, service, and whatnot, I was a bit dismayed to find that the salad bar was a bit lacking in terms of fresh fruits/veggies options goes. So many carbs, so many oily options ... didn't really help my conscience that I was eating a bunch of meat as well (though I don't exactly come here for that very reason). Otherwise, great place to come to in terms that steakhouses go. Be warned that parking can be a bit annoying since it's in Station Square, which tends to be a bit more expensive parking-wise if you don't have validated parking (for those who work there) or leased parking.",

    "text": "After giving up on the staff at Joe's Crab Shack for my father's birthday dinner (for some reason he likes it there, why, I don't know), my family settled on trying Texas de Brazil based on some initial feedback we had received from a friend and the sheer smell of meat radiating across the plaza.  The wife and I had an OK previous experience at Green Forest, but unfortunately, Texas de Brazil left us rather dissatisfied with the entire evening.  Following a rather disorganized seating process (the hostess more or less insisted we head to the bar to wait, but no sooner did we get there and attempt to order drinks, two separate servers tried to come seat us), we were sat at a table.  We waited an easy 5-10 minutes before anyone even came to the table.  Once our server arrived, he more or less just said to go grab our food (we still hadn't received water at this point), at which time, we interjected that two of our guests would be getting the lite dinner option (which he immediately became disgruntled and attempted to insist that they get the full dinner - go figure, the meals were $20 cheaper).  Throughout the evening, we only received one refill on water even though our glasses were consistently empty.  Also, while it seemed there were a wide variety of meats to be enjoyed, the same 3-4 options kept being brought to the table (on our way out, I noticed 3 different meats that never even made it to our table to try).  In addition, the cheese bread, potatoes, and bananas all went un-replenished once the first set was eaten.  After a certain point, we simply decided we wanted to cut our losses and leave the restaurant (but we couldn't, as the server couldn't be found to ask for the check - we had to ask a gaucho to find him for us).  The final straw in our experience was the fact that we were charged 18% gratuity for what has been the worse service we've received year to date in Pittsburgh.  This is why I don't let family pick restaurants for celebratory dinners.  For the $43 + tax/gratuity per person that we had to drop on this bucket, I could of easily taken them to any of the best-in-class joints the burgh has to offer.  What a waste.",

The salad bar was almost exciting. We actually loved the salad with the homemade dressings. The bisque was extremely good.  We decided to get meat right away. My teenage sons just couldn't wait. There was a constant flow of meats. We agreed that the flank steak was the best. Our second choice was a toss up because there were so many good choices. I could see how it could get too busy and perhaps the server could forget to bring something requested. But the meat never stops.  We had fun and were pleasantly surprised. We were celebrating two birthdays, so we got two free desserts. Yes, it is expensive so I couldn't go often. But I will certainly go back.",

It's a little high end with charcuterie options, quinoa salads, and lots of other options. They also have soup. The Lobster Bisque is rather thin but full of flavor. You serve yourself from the salad bar and soup which both come with your meal. When you are ready to eat meat you sit at your table and the meat parade (as I call it) begins. They bring huge skewers of different meats to your table. We tried everything. The filet was melt in your mouth but we found ourselves liking the lamb the most. Of course they had pork tenderloin and other types of meat. They were all delicious. All of the servers were friendly and made the experience enjoyable.  It is a bit pricy but worth every penny.",

The caipirinhas were ok, but not as good as Seviche- for my taste palate. However, the food is what took this restaurant to a perfect score in my opinion.  The salad/cold bar is packed with the good stuff; mushrooms, potato salad, regular salad, salmon (which is amazing), asparagus, tabouleh, and the list goes on.   The best part of the meal was all the meat. I'm not a huge meat eater in everyday life, but if you come here - be prepared for a protein overload (in a good way). The chicken selections were okay, but my favorites were the lamb chops, steak selections, and BBQ pork ribs. Yes... I had them ALL! They also have leg of lamb, parmesan chicken, bacon wrapped chicken, filet mignon, bacon wrapped chicken, flank steak, beef ribs, sausage, parmesan pork, etc,. Plus- they bring mashed potatoes, bread, and fried bananas to the table.   I would recommend saving your appetite for Texas de Brazil in order to try everything your heart desires.   I will be back soon, and suggest this restaurant to everyone I know!",

Filet Mignon wrapped in bacon, Brazilian Sausage, Parmesan crusted pork loin etc.    Our waitress did state to \"pace yourself\" but that was difficult to do because once you started to taste one selection - another one would arrive.   I had a tough time turning my little disk on our table to the \"red\" side -which halted any new meat from arriving.  We received two sides - garlic mashed potatoes and sweet grilled bananas (which are supposed to cleanse your pallet).  The mashed potatoes were tasty but the garlic was a bit too strong for my taste. The grilled bananas were different.        The restaurant was busy and seemed as if our waitress was overwhelmed it took a little while for our drinks to arrive.  Our water goblets were not refilled either.   This was a great experience and I look forward to my next visit.",

    "text": "Texas de Brazil has become one of my family and friends favorite places to go for dinner. This past weekend I made reservations for a party of 15 with the help of the Manager ( I believe his name was Mike ). When we arrived the table was ready and waiting for us at 7:45. The salad bar was stocked full with great choices of fresh foods. The meats were all amazing, I like my food cooked a little longer and they are very accommodating to that fact. Our server was Ryan and he was very informative and fun for our entire group.   My only complaint was the bathroom situation. I'm positive they did not do a bathroom check for the two hours we spent there. There was toilet paper and fecal matter all over every stall but one. It's a Saturday night, I understand they are busy but this needs addressed. I'm disappointed in the ladies that left it in such disarray.",

    "text": "Quite a bit of fun. Lots of food and festive. Texas de Brasil offers the typical American take on a Brazilian Steak House. The unique serving style can only be found at a couple of local places in the Pittsburgh region.  All of the Brasil steakhouse restaurants in Pgh are similar. They are all delicious. Texas de Brasil is superior in the sense that Station Square is by far a much nicer setting for a night out in comparison to the local competing Brazilian style steak houses. Texas de Brasil is a national chain and one can expect the consistency found in most national chains.  Consistency is good.   I highly recommend avoiding this location during any promotional events. We made the mistake of making a reservation without realizing it was restaurant week. The place was packed beyond packed and the restaurant experience was not worth the small discount offered.  The staff appeared a bit stretched thin and wait times on meat carvings was much longer than usual.  Wait staff was a tab bit less attentive than usual. For example we had to ask for the meat servers to return at least five times before they did so. (That is unheard of during other nights we have dined) Also, the mint jelly did not taste the way it typically does and the waitstaff seemed too spread thin to be concerned about the fermented quality. (Sadly their mint jelly is what makes their lamb exceptional)   Go on a regular evening so you can leisurely dine without the insanity of over bookings. Yes, the experience is not low cost however it's a fun evening out. Expect on a regular evening to be FLOCKED with various meat carvings. Food and drinks arrive quickly and the staff will be charming.  You will leave satisfied and slightly shocked at the amount of meat you can consume! Texas de Brasil is a great location for a family night out.",

The bartender and servers were polite and attentive.

I recommend this place based on my first experience.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place but our experience last night left a lot to be desired. Let's start with service.. we had a reservation and were promptly seated. And then we waited and waited for probably 15 minutes before a guest I was with flagged down a meat server to send a waiter over... then as the night went on our waiter finally brought over clean plates after our plates were filled with meat scrapes for awhile. We were there for about an hour when he asked \"are you done?\" And grabbed all of our plates and the clean ones off the table. Some people at our table were not done yet so I felt like we were really rushed out of this place even though there were maybe 10 tables there. Next, the food.. I enjoyed some items at the salad bar and thought they had a good/unique selection. The meat was okay.. I thought some of it was way TOO rare and I usually enjoy rare meat. I know they cook their meat on rock salt but some pieces were so extremely salty and inedible. All the meat servers rushed our table when we first sat down and then they were no where to be found about 45 minutes in which I thought was really strange. Dessert was okay but I feel as if 9 dollars for a piece of cake is pretty outrageous. All in all this place was just okay. Service was seriously lacking and food was just ok. For the price I feel as if all aspects of the dining experience should be outstanding but in this case it just wasn't.",

My husband tried to make a reservation this afternoon, we both called them several times and they never picked up the phone. So we left the message for them and told them we would have four people and asked them to call us back about the status of our reservation. They didn't called us back. 4 hours later When we got to the restaurant, the hostesses very rudely and abruptly told us the wait was an hour and a half without even saying hello, despite the fact that the restaurant was half empty. My husband explained that he had called several times but nobody had picked up the phone to which they replied that they were too busy to pick up their own phone. Their attitude was very unprofessional and we will not be returning ever. It is a shame because the first time we went here we really liked it and we were hoping to introduce his parents to it. But it was embarrassing to be treated that way after talking the restaurant up so much. They have lost our business permanently.",

She forgot our drinks twice and I went up to the manager for him to get them for us.  She was only waiting on 3 tables besides our table and the restaurant was not that busy.  She did not refill our waters. Two of our people had a little bit of their dessert left and she asked if they needed a box and they said yes but she never brought them back after ten minutes so they left them on the table. For the amount of money we spent on this dinner I expected the service to be excellent.  On a positive note the food was delicious.  Last time it was really salty and this time it was much better.  Probably the last time we will be there.",

    "text": "Great service, decor and food. I was very pleased with my overall experience at this new Pittsburgh Churrascaria. I've been to quite a few Brazilian steakhouses and the quality of meat here is one of the highest I've had. The flank steak was my favorite, with a gamier, more grassy flavor to the meat. Very different and awesome. The quality of the filet mignon was excellent, too, and I consider myself a filet connosieur. :) Try the traditional Brazilian drink Caipirinha. It is a sweeter, smoother version of a margarita but made with rum. They have a few flavors, strawberry being my favorite. Our server Eddie was incredibly personable, funny, and efficient. He took care of all of my food allergies and let me know what was safe!   Gluten free info: most of the meats are gluten free, but a lot of the salad bar/hot food bar items aren't. In fact, I was told every hot food bar item had gluten in it, as well as the bread, salami, shrimp and salmon on the salad bar. No Fogo de Chao similarities there.  Soy allergy: do not eat any meat that has been marinated, no salad dressings, no marinated items on the salad bar. All have soybean oil. However, the chef specially made cuts of meat for me without marinade so I could sample everything! Very hospitable.   There was a little miscommunication about what was safe for me to eat, but considering this is a new restaurant and I have a billion food allergies, they worked very hard to make sure I didn't get sick!",

If you've never been to a Brazilian churrascaria place, it's basically a meat buffet. You get a card that you can turn to red or green. Red means stop and green means keep it coming. Steak, chicken parmasean, bacon wrapped steak, skirt steak, filet, lamb and a few more. Servers walk around with skewers and they cut off pieces of you want to try it.  There's also a salad bar with some hot sides and soup. The lobster bisque was good. I try not to fill up on the sides so I can have room for the meat. There weren't much side hot side options. The Jasmine rice was good. Some of the meat was a little salty but otherwise ok.  The price was a little high for the small side and salad bar.",

    "text": "I knew this would be an expensive meal before going. Overall 3 1/2 stars. We had 2 adults, 2 kids (6&8) and bill was $200 after tip. We had food plus pitcher of sangria and ginger ale for kids because that was the only drink served that was refillable. Also split 1 slice of chocolate mousse cake. With adjustments for drinks and kids meals(see below) this could easily be 4.5 stars and overall value worth the visit.   Food: 4 1/2 stars because the meats are amazing, salad bar alone is a mEal and quite impressive. The meat comes with two cinnamon sugar plantains and mashed potatoes. There is jasmine rice, wine portobello shrooms etc on buffet to compliment the meat course. Kids enjoy the salad bar so if we went again I wouldn't waste the meat on them. Stick to salad bar for kids as there's bacon, shrimp, salmon, cold cuts, vegetables, rice, fruit for them. You can save money this way. Older kids however would enjoy the meat. Only downside is beef served med-rare. We specially requested med-well and I felt the beef/ lamb cuts were not as good quality. They had more fat on them. Also the lobster bisque had zero lobster in it. It was like a sherry lobster favored broth which was disappointing.  Drinks: 1 star. Way too expensive. I enjoy wine but the markups here are 3x or more for a bottle. Rex Goliath is 10-12$ and it was priced at $39. In stead we got a pitcher of sangria which had no alcohol whatsoever. For $29 it was like an expensive fruit filled pitcher of juice. Kids drinks aren't refillable except ginger ale. Stick to water while you're here. About 20% of the bill can be saved by sticking to water and drinks here are a rip-off.   Ambiance: 4.5 stars. Restaurant is well decorated, CLEAN (bathrooms and buffet were in top condition). Took away half star because the tables are a bit close for my taste and we had a stroller for a sleeping baby.   Service: 4 1/2 stars. Our waitress was great. She always had a clean plate for us and was very attentive. I took half star away because even when our cards were red the meat servers still kept coming by. They almost swarm your table which can be overwhelming a little bit trying to get your own meat and manage kids who need theirs cut up. That said you definitely get a full plate of great tasting meat. They also don't rush you out. Managers as well were on the floor the entire time making sure everything was running smoothly and asked everyone how the were enjoying their meals. Dirty Plates are quickly gathered and new ones magically appearing as well. This restaurant gets the importance of good service.",

I tried one of their cheese I forget the name, it was so delicious! Also they have sushi maki rolls which are pretty good too. The range of the selection is just so wide. They got soup, chilli, cold cuts, cheese, sushi salmon, rice, couscous, shrimps...etc. everything from the salad bar was so tasty.

The restaurant was busy, but our waitress, Autumn, was completely on the ball. Our water glasses never went empty and she was conscious of what needed refilled on the table and asked several times if there was any particular types of meat we were looking for.  We ordered a pitcher of the house sangria, which was plenty enough for the three of us drinking it. My husband had the speciality mojito, which was also delicious.   The cold bar had an excellent variety of meats, cheeses, salads, sushi, and shrimp. We could not get enough of the cheese bread balls and the plantains! We could do without the mashed potatoes.  The meats were delivered regularly and everyone who came to our table was very friendly. They even accommodated numerous requests for our meat to be cooked to a higher temperature (the meat is typically cooked to medium rare). The quality is f meat was top notch (says my father the butcher). The beef rib fell off the bone and was a huge hit at our table. My husband also ate the lamb, which he said was delicious. They had a house special top sirloin and the seasoning was amazing!  Yes, the meat is very salty, but they explain up front that it's because of how's it's prepared (traditionally on a bed of rock salt).   This restaurant is everything we expected it to be: a meat lover's paradise.",

Good cheese, good meats, good salad.  When the meats started coming out it was like heaven.  The people who brought things out were very nice.  The meats were very good and our waitress was amazing.  We told her we wanted more poppers and more lamb and she had it brought it up.  I will be back.  As a tip if you want more of something.   Tell your waitress.",

    "text": "I have the restaurant 3 stars because it was amazing service, the buffet was clean and well organized and our waitress was very helpful the buffet had fresh cheeses, sliced meats, vegetables and your average salad bar. They also had a hot section with three choices, rice beans and cheesy potatoes. I would say if your a meat lover this place is for you, the samples are small but you can ask for more. The meat to me and my family seemed a bit salty. We went through so many waters at dinner because of how salty the meat was. There was a lot of options but I don't think it's worth the price. It was a fun experience but honestly just a glorified buffet. I've had better steaks and meat elsewhere.",

    "text": "Freaking awesome. Great sides, loved the bar. The shrimp was very undervalued. As far as the meats, I would have to go with the top sirloin, great taste!!! Also the bacon wrapped chicken was pretty tasty as well.  It was a little odd that they didn't have fountain coke. But what do I know I don't own a multi million dollar restaurant. Can't wait till our one opens in Lexington!!!",

    "text": "As time has gone on, the service at this Texas de Brazil has only gone downhill.  We've been here at least 3 times over the past year.  Food at the salad bar was not replenished...I ordered a refill of my drink and had to remind the waitress after a half hour that I still hadn't gotten it...it was a soft drink and for the first time ever I was charged for a refill of ginger ale.  The meat either came all at once or we went long stretches where the servers didn't come around at all.  The variety of meats has seemingly been reduced over the past year or so, too.  I'm aware that a new Brazilian meat buffet has opened in downtown and my wife and I both decided we would try somewhere else the next time we go out for this type of experience.  For two adults and two kids it cost over $140.  For that price I expect more.",

    "text": "I finally ventured in here for lunch today - I heard good things and wasn't disappointed.  Everyone will comment on how the restaurant operates, but what about the FOOD??  I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor and quality of everything from the salad bar to the roasted meats.  I thought maybe this place would be so focused on their 'unique' dining experience that the food would suffer - not the case!  A few things to note that might be helpful:  1. Lunch offerings are different than dinner.  Cheaper price but less options on salad bar as well as with meat options. 2. You can go to Costco and buy $100 gift cards for $79. 3. If you're paying with gift card - you CANNOT place a tip on your bill.  Cash only. 4  Go on their website and sign up for their email list a few days prior for a \"$25 off dinner for two coupon\". 5. You have the option to just purchase the salad bar at a much lower price, if that's your thing.  Will be going back soon to hit up the salad bar (I still have $30 left on my giftcard.)",

    "text": "This was our first visit and I'm giving the food only 4 stars.  The salad bar was amazing and we had no problems with the quality of frequency of the meats offered.  However....we were greeted (and I use the term loosely) by the worst hostess I've ever encountered in a restaurant.  She didn't smile, spoke like a robot and acted like she was doing US a favor by leading us to first one table, then no.....another table......all without making eye contact or speaking. And this is the first impression of their restaurant!  She asked if we were celebrating anything (we were there for a birthday) but no complimentary dessert ever materialized.   There was confusion over who was supposed to be our server and one staff person snottily replied IT'S RIGHT THERE when asked the location of the restroom. Wow.  Do they really think the food is so good that they can get away with this attitude????",

The only issue is that the meat doesn't come around fast enough, and when it does you only get one slice/piece. So you basically get one small piece of meat every few minutes.",
