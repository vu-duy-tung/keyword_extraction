    "text": "Dear reader,  I submit to you this humble comparison of two Gyro joints that sit within spitting distance of each other. But it's more profound than just bragging rights for the best Gyro, this is also a tale of Yelp vs. local word of mouth. You see, I was challenged by a friend not 30 minutes before on the quality of Yelp reviews vs. WOM.   So I'm getting a ride from a local (thanks Bernie!) to the South Side, and he points out a Gyro joint as being the best in P'burg (Mike and Tony's) and then I see just across the corner another Gyro joint I recognized from Yelp reviews as having 4.5 stars. So it hits me. Let's put his tithe test.   I asked to be dropped off, pull up Yelp and check reviews. Sure enough, my WOM rec, Mike and Tony's has only 4 stars, and Lesvos has 4.5. I see my opportunity to test local WOm vs. Yelp right then and there (and eat two Gyros instead of one!)  I won't belabor the results:  Mike and Tony's was a better experience for me, thought neither was perfect.   M&T's - 4 stars Lesvos - 3 stars  Now, keep in mind this is based on one visit, Gyro to Gyro. Sampling method is not perfect since there was a few minutes between eating each, and Mike and Tony's likely has an advantage since I was more hungry when I ate theirs (although I only ate half to try to control for this).  Here are some details:  M&T - total hole in the wall, but not in a bad way. Gyro came in seconds to my table, piping hot and absolutely piled with meat. It was juicy, and the pita had just the right amount of resistance. The meat was just a tad over seasoned, as another reviewer mentioned, but really food flavor overall. The tatziki sauce tasted like straight sour cream to me, with similar texture. It wasn't bad, but I prefer something a little mote delicate, with some lemon, cucumber, and a bit of yogurt tang. Overall, pretty freaking tasty.   Lesvos - also pretty good ( and same price BTW), but just missing on a couple of things. The meat was a little dry, and though tasty, not quite as tasty. There was less meat although still a generous portion. The sauce was a tad more delicate, though still mostly tasting like sour cream. The bread was not bad, but just a tad more presence than ideal for perfect balance - a little too thick and chewy.   Moral of the story? Not exactly sure, but if I had gone by Yelp alone, I would have missed out on the better Gyro just next door.",

I remember the first time I went in there it reminded me a lot of my first visit to In&Out.  Simple menu, so hurry up and order, there is a line behind you.    What impressed me about this place was the quality of the meat and the quantity that they are able to load into the wrap.  Wow.  Normally I tend to ask for double/extra meat but at the time I only had $5 in my pocket so I went with normal.  But I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of meat they stuffed into the wrap along with the fresh vegetables.    Every time I get a chance, I definitely walk through the door of Mike and Tony's to get a little slice of gyro heaven.  Cash Only",

Its got the steel town vibe. doesnt get much better. Its IMPOSSIBLE to find a gyro like this on the west coast.

    "text": "There are a lot of places that serve gyros in the area.  And everyone that I spoke to said this was the place to try -- and I spoke to a lot of people.  One fine day, I just happen to be near this location during lunch hour and figure I might as well try it.  The interior is a tad dark and dank which tends to make it feel a bit dirtier than it might have been.  The associates behind the counter were nice and were more than willing to help us.  I was happy to see the spits of gyro meat turning at the front of the store -- no precut freezer meat here.  We ordered the following at the counter:  Fries Barqs Plain steak pita with cheddar sauce Gyro with tomato and tzitziki sauce on the side  Taking the rootbeer with us, we found a table.  It was a bit dirty from the previous customer and I couldn't figure out why -- the place was barren. The food was rather quick to come to the table and looked very good.  As I normally do, I tried the meat and the sauce separately.  The meat was over-seasoned while the sauce was underseasoned.  I don't even think that it was tzitziki sauce, but I went forward with my meal.  Trying to find that balance, I began adding the sauce to the gyro.  With each bite, I had to add more sauce.  It got to the point where I didn't want to add any more sauce.  Luckily, I had added enough sauce to enjoy the gyro.   I tried a piece of the steak pita and went back to my gyro -- the steak was full of fat and gristle while also being tough.  I didn't need to eat anymore of it.  The fries were your standard freezer fare and were fried properly -- crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  In the end, I would say that Lina G's has a better gyro.  I really don't like my gyro swimming in sauce and if I have to choose between Mike's and Lina's, it will be Lina's every day.  It is much easier to add seasoning to an unbalanced gyro with sauce than it is to remove seasoning from the meat.  Still looking for a gyro that is balanced.",

I made the eleven minute drive from my apartment to Mike and Tony's Gyros and Shish-Kabobs and I was rather disappointed.   French Fries: Delicious, crispy, golden brown. Crunchy on the outside and just the right amount of soft potatoey-ness on the inside. They were also piping hot and made to order.  Gyro: The meat was under-seasoned and the sauce was not very flavorful. I've definitely have had better tasting gyros. The bread was a little crunchy/hard on the edges.   Coke: Delicious!!!  Maybe it was the rising expectations that led to this Mike and Tony's gyro experience being not so great so I've decided to give them another try in the future. Until then I will be trying the gyro shop on the next block!",

For the three of us, the two orders of fries was too much.  The gyros were awesome. I got the soulvaki and she got the steak. My soulvaki came with at least a dozen grilled chunks of meat enclosed in a soft pita, lettuce, tomato and tsatsiki. I ended up eating my sandwich with a knife and fork because there was too many contents for the pita. The steak was delicious, too. She got a solid sheet of steak about 1/4 inch thick. She said the tsatsiki was the best she ever tried. I liked it alot but I wouldn't say it was the best. I actually thought it was a little too salty. We also ordered the baklava. My girlfriend had never had it before but she loved it. As did our 2 year old daughter.  My only complaint is that my pita started falling apart on me. We showed up pretty early in the morning, so maybe they were finishing last night's pita. But that's my only complaint!  This place is apparently a Pittsburgh staple and it was our first trip there. Its definitely top notch. They have a pretty simple menu. Service was prompt and friendly. This place is cash only. And beware! You order first, then eat, then pay when you leave. We almost walked out after our meal.",

The meat could have been tough and should have been tenderized or was old? Hard to tell, but I don't like to chew and chew meat forever. Also way too much salt and overkill.with the cucumber sauce that didn't have any flavor. The workers were nice and good service though.",

    "text": "This is a very straightforward, no-frills place to get your gyro. Like many places in the area, it's pretty appropriate for crashing after barhopping or getting some drinks at neighboring joints. Prices are cheap, and portions are pretty big. The gyro meat is quite tasty, and they give you a lot if you order the plate--literally overflowing onto the salad part of the plate. The sandwich was okay too (we got the steak), though the meat portion seemed a bit less and it was a bit messy to eat by hand. So my verdict would be to go for a plate if it's late at night and you're looking for a filling meal. It's great how both the sandwich and plate also come with combos with things like salad, fries, and fountain drink.",

For some reason after consuming gallons of alcohol all you wanna do is shove food down your throat. You are wondering around the southside with your friends, 2 girls you met in a bar and a random homeless guy who you thought was the funniest dude alive. All of a sudden you stumble onto a little shack type place with a lit sign outside that says \"mike & tony's.\"   My friend you have just hit drunk heaven.  For the rookie orderer at mike and tonys it may seem like the \"soup nazi\" skit from seinfeld. You need to know what you want, these guys move quick, they only take cash and the gyro is an even 5 bucks. Don't studder or they will move on to the next person until you are ready. Once you order, move to the right, wait for your bag and get the hell out!   Usually by the time you get to the corner you have unwrapped it and taken your first bites of this magnificent spectacle. I've seen many a rookies first reaction. You slightly tear up at first, embarassed you wipe the tears of joy from your face. Then you look down at this magical wonder you have just traded for five dollars of currency and try to speak through your full mouth of tender lamb meat, \"this is the greatest thing I have ever eaten.\"  They have won, Mike & Tonys will forever be a southside tradition now.",

The meat to wrap ratio was just divine. The meat was beautifully seasoned, although slightly a bit salty. The sauce tasted straight up like yogurt. I wasn't very impressed.

For me, their gyros are second only to St. Nicks Greek food festival. Both places have a fantastic gyro, which comes with a ton of meat, with an amazing tzatziki sauce, except compared to St. Nicks $8.00, Mike and Tony's is only for $5.50! Whatda bargin! The pork was a little fatty but spiced and cooked well, and with pork you get fat, so I can't really can't blame them for that. It was also a little more expense, but still totally worth it. The spinach pie was \"eh\" for me but I'm not into that too much. The only thing I think would put this place over the top would be some kick-ass hand cut fries. Alas, they have yucky frozen fries.

If you get it to go, they send you off with your gyro in a plain brown paper bag, just like a typical school lunch. Only this is way better than any school lunch i've ever had.

I've never been to Greece, and if I had to think of a better Gyro, the only one that comes close, is Central Gyros in Chicago. I can't choose which one I like better, so I'm going to have to say they're jointly the best Gyro I have ever had, and therefore this really is the food gem of Pittsburgh. Of course you have to try Fiore's Pizza and Peppi's Roethlisburger too, but if you only have 1 meal, 1 time, in Pitt, and you like Gyros... here, my friends, is your Mecca. Brought to you by Mr Tyson and Mr Romo.  There are actually two locations of this, and because it had a shorter line, i think I like the Southside version better. But there is one downtown that caters to the lunch crowd, and they are excellent too. Another thing that is fantastic about Mike & Tony's is the price! Their Gyro (piled with juicy delicious meat, with loads of fluffy Gyro style pizza, sharp onions, juicy tomatoes, and creamy yogurt sauce), is cheaper than most burgers! Extremely impressive! Just like the founders, Mr Jackson and Mr Hopkins.  Gyros should be made a certain way. There's an exception, in Buffalo, where \"Gyros\" are something else entirely in some Greek diners, and are very good, if not as good as traditional Gyros. But what I cannot stand is those fake, frozen, pre-packaged Gyro strips. They are already cut out in Gyro strip shape, and they just grill those and bam, Gyros. No thank you! Gyros are supposed to be shaved off a large spindle, delicious and juicy and fresh... that's the only way to go. Add some yogurt sauce, onions and tomatoes on a Gyro Pita - the end. The best in the world are Mike & Tony's in Pittsburgh, and Central Gyros in Chicago. Nom nom nom. This place does Gyros RIGHT! So thank you Mr Jordan and Mr Soprano.  Parking is tricky and tight at both locations, so be careful. They're always a little tow-happy in Pittsburgh, though not as bad as NYC. Try around the corner from the Southside location, that's your best bet. I asked owners Mr Buble and Mr Bennett and they told me the same thing.  Mike and Tony's - you are absolutely outstanding!!!  My original review (what was I thinking)  One of the best Gyros in America, hands down. Very cheap too. Eat it while it's hot, that's the way it's supposed to be. Then let's make out, so I can taste some of that Gyro too. Well, no, I mean, I'd love to make out anyway, but tasting the Gyro is a bonus. OK OK, I admit it, I just want the Gyro taste! You caught me Blue-and-white handed! (the greek flag. Although there is nothing greek about this place. It just happens to make better Gyros than most Greeks).  So thanks again to Mr J. Fox and Mr Hawk for opening this place!",

I figured that, hey, \"You're in the South Side.  The world is your oyster!\" when it comes to good, inexpensive, quick eats that aren't necessarily from a chain.  After a quick Yelp sweep, enter the five-dollar gyro from Mike and Tony's.  Hot, and more importantly, FRESH, and fast.  And cheap.  And goooooood.  I tortured the poor receptionist and assistant at the salon as I inhaled it in the waiting area like a hungry racoon before going back to get my hair done because it smelled as delicious as it tasted.  If a gyro is this good on a stone-cold sober Tuesday evening, can you imagine what people do after stumbling out of Mario's Saloon?  Mike and Tony must have to avoid getting full on mouth-kissed by patrons left and right!  One more thing: it's cash only.  That's probably contributing to how they can keep the prices so reasonable.  Don't worry, they have an ATM right there in the restaurant.  Ante up!",

    "text": "Hands down best gyro in Pittsburgh in my opinion.  Possibly the best gyro ever.  Even at 2am when there's a line of drunk people waiting, the staff is quick and efficient.  Clearly they've been doing this for awhile.  The fries are not the best, but for some reason I always get them with the gyro because they taste so good together.  The gyro is so jam packed with goodness that when they hand it to you you don't think it's that big...until you unwrap the foil and start eating it.  I always eat mine so fast that I nearly choke.  I can think of no sweeter death.  I used to frequent Mike & Tony's on a regular basis when I lived in the South Side.  Now that I don't, I try to stop by whenever I happen to be in the neighborhood.  I just can't resist.",

The service was great, the staff were nice, but to achieve True greatness, I think the pita needs to be fried on the griddle with a bit of butter for crispy contrast, and the tzaziki does need a little zip, and even some cucumber.  Don't get me wrong: this is a solid entry in the \"what should we eat for lunch?\" quiz, but it needs a little more finesse to knock my socks off.",

    "text": "Note: Cash Only!!!  Heed my words.  When you go to Mike & Tony's, order the gyro, the french fries, a beverage, and nothing else.  Do not deviate from this path.  I made a fatal error one evening last week prior to the Exodus concert at The Rex Theater.   After debating where to go eat with my fellow metallions as we waited for The Rex's doors to open, they all swayed me towards Mike & Tony's, a franchise I was acquainted with and whose low prices were too tempting for this cheapskate to resist.   Why didn't I order the gyro after relishing it once before at their other restaurant?  In the name of Yelp and wanting to try and therefore review something different, I ordered Souvlaki.   Gyros don't take long. A young man with hair long enough for me to wonder if he was depressed over having to miss an important metal concert just doors away utilized some sort of hand-held electric slicer with a disc for a blade, whizzing and whirring away at the lamb loaves flicked by small orange flames, manufacturing flaps and flaps of grey-ish, speckled protein. He crafted at least 10 gyros as I sat in a wobbly chair at a wobbly table sipping on a Hi-C watching coverage of the recent Boston Marathon bombings unfurl horrifically.  The more my Souvlaki was delayed, the deeper the feeling of potential disappointment sank into my heart, paralleling that of current evens. I watched the nuggets of pork being neglected and could almost smell them burning as news of the dead and injured flashed on the television.   When the sandwich arrived in front of me with no plate provided, my hunch proved correct.  The meat was the consistency of a door stopper. It felt as if I had stolen a 100-piece o-ring set from a plumber in a fit of insanity and was trying to chew a handful of them. The pita bread haplessly crumbled upon each bite as chunks of elastic beef spilled out of it, bouncing...bouncing off of the table's surface, nearly scalding my mouth.  \"We have no idea right now who did this or why, just to reiterate,\" I heard a male, middle-aged voice state coldly, his deep, authoritative voice resonating throughout the busy restaurant.  With 1/4 of the sandwich left to eat, I hurled the rest of the sham into a trash bin and left angrily.  \"What's wrong, man?\" One of my buddies asked. I was silent.  \"What happened? Didja get the gyro?\" Matt knew something was amiss.   \"No, I uh...got Souvlaki.\"  \"What??? You dumb-ass!\" The sound of a dozen groans and half as many hands smacking against foreheads could be heard.   \"I need dessert,\" I blurted flatly. With some more time left to spend and wanting to leave disappointment behind, I headed over to The Milkshake Factory for comfort.   A lesson was learned: Just order the gyro at Mike & Tony's. Exploring the remainder of their menu will result in grief, one that cannot be compared to that which was brought about in another state or is rained down daily overseas by our military but grief nonetheless.  P.S. I should note that I've also been to M&T's Downtown Pittsburgh location and had a much better experience, their gyros being very moist, tasty, generously appointed, and filling (that tzatziki sauce could use a little more zip, however). Not ordering the gyro was folly.",

My boyfriend and I order the same exact thing every time we come here. I get the chicken gyro special with ranch instead of cucumber sauce and an Iced Tea as my drink. The boyfriend orders the gyro special with everything on it and a Coke.  The food is always consistently good!  I adore the chicken gyro. They marinate the chicken for hours and it is obvious when you take a bite out of it. It's full of flavor and it's juicy! Since it's cooked on the grill, it has that charred taste to it slightly and I love that! The ranch is awesome too, although it is a little runny. The pita bread is amazing too- soft, but at the same time it doesn't get very soggy if you order take out.   The fries are delicious too- although, sometimes the cook (depending on who is working) over fries them and they are a little too crisp for my liking.   My boyfriend LOVES the regular gyro. Never anything to complain about there.  We are addicted to this place and do not plan on venturing out to try other gyro places. We already found our favorite!",

    "text": "A gyro under 5 bucks? Yes.   It was filling, tasty, and quick!  My friend and I biked to South Side for the sole purpose of obtaining a gyro. Under her recommendation we went here and let me tell you - it was worth the life risking bike ride. The bike ride isn't bad, I'm just a horrible biker, so getting here is actually quite easy. We ordered our gyros, went to wash our sweaty hands and came down to sit to our freshly made gyros. I love, love the gyro bread, the fluffy goodness that cushions your jaw with every bite. I would advise everyone to get this. EVERYONE.",

The fries were crispy and the guy gave us both a lot! We came before they were closing so it was really nice of the staff to serve us. Would definitely order from again!",
