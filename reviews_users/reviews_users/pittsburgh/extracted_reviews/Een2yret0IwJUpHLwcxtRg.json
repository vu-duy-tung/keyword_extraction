He had been looking for a restaurant that made a wonderful fried chickpea sandwiches he enjoyed while serving a mission in Livorno, Italy. When he saw that Arancini House serves authentic Sicilian food, he looked at their website and saw THE sandwich! (Panelle)  We loved the place as soon as we walked down the stairs and were met by amazing smells and very friendly people.   Since we hadn't been to Arancini House before, the lovely person behind the counter gave us a great description of their traditional foods and their origins.  We ordered The Original and Al Burro arancini, panelle sandwiches, pepperoni rolls, meatball rolls and wedding soup. Everything was delicious. The food was hot, fresh and ample in portions. We just loved how welcomed we felt. This is our new favorite place! We just wish they had a franchise in Washington State!",

A friend and I split three balls -- the red with ragu, white with bechamel and the weekly special -- greens and beans. It was tough picking a favorite because they were all wonderful. I look forward to returning and trying the panelle, the rolls and the pizza. My friend actually returned the same night for dinner. It's that good. Great place with a wonderful owner.",

    "text": "They have Saturday hours!!  Had read about this place a couple of times and really wanted to try it, but their hours just didn't work for me.  So, I was psyched to see their hours had changed (thanks, yelp)!    Stopped by around 11:30 on a Saturday.  Joe, who I assumed was one of the owners, was super-friendly.  He explained their options and told us about some of their plans.    It's a cute little space on the terrace level (read: basement) near across from the Saloon and up the block on Washington from La Pomponee (etc).  Lots of seating.  Had the broccolini arancini (fried risotto ball), eggplant parm roll and a san pellegrino.  The texture of the arancini was quite nice.  Soft on the inside and lightly crisp on the outside.  The roll had a nice mix of ingredients to give it flavor without being soggy.  It came with a side of sauce.  I thought the sauce was quite good - definitely made the roll.  DH had a sausage and pepper roll and a slice of pizza.  He found the pizza (a new addition to the menu) to be a tad greasy (they use whole milk moz), but solved that with a napkin.  Our total was just over $20 - so comparable to what we'd spend at a take out place (Chipotle, etc).  All in all, a really great addition to the neighborhood!  We'll be back.",

I can not say enough good things about Arancini House. Their soups are probably my favorite but the pizza is a close second. Everything is great so it's hard to choose. Some have said it's hard to find, but they now have a sign on the street level and a neon sign by the door so you can't miss it. It's so nice to go to a place that is inviting. The fish sandwich during Lent is fantastic too. Everything on the menu is great. This little gem is a must try.",

    "text": "If you are in the mood to try authentic Sicilian food at an affordable price in an adorable atmosphere with the friendliest, extremely talented owners- look no further! This is not your lit up store front that you pass on the street, look in and decide to try it; instead, you read the sidewalk sign and proceed to the left where you follow two flights of stairs down and to the right. This place defines \"hidden gem\" in every sense of the term. The ambiance is bright, fun and intimate. It is very welcoming and the owners add to that. My mom and I were walking in Mount Lebanon looking for a place to eat when I stopped to read the sign for Arancini House. Being that I'm on a restrictive diet, I was going to turn away when two patrons heard my mom and I talking and told us we have got to try their amazing food. They even went on to say that the owners would try to make me something that fit my Paleo diet. We followed their advice and couldn't be happier. Joe (owner along with Manny) was so bright and passionate about his food and business that you couldn't help but get excited about it too. I ordered the chickpea fritters (flour and chickpea). Joe was so enthused about this dish that he wanted me to try it before I even thought of buying it! What great customer service! I ended up buying two orders! They have such a phenomenal taste that I can barely describe it: a beautiful lemony taste paired with baked chickpea and a fried crust. You really need to try it and then do a better job than I could in describing it. It is phenomenal. I ordered the two of the house salad with chopped romaine and spring mix, roasted red peppers, olives, artichokes, cherry tomatoes, and a homemade red wine vinaigrette. I told the owner all about my diet and he decided to make me a new salad complete with  protein (tuna). My mom ordered the meatball roll and really enjoyed it! She was also impressed with the chickpea fritters, I was so absolutely thrilled with the service and dining experience at Arancini House that I would recommend this restaurant to everyone and anyone!",

I also had a side salad with a fantastic vinaigrette.  Not pricey in the least and you get a great meal.  It is definitely a little hidden as you walk down a flight of stairs off the street level, but inside it's quite cozy and welcoming.  My guess is they will grow quickly and maybe eventually move to a street level storefront some day.  Viva arancini house!",

We asked the co-owner and he explained to us that he owns the restaurant with his father in law (I believe) and the recipes are all traditional Sicilian recipes that his family has been making for years.  The arancini balls were great but what was even better was the vegetarian eggplant roll we had!  Imagine a non-flaky and semi-doughy croissant.  Now imagine it stuffed with eggplant parmesan.  Yum!  Thank you, Arancini House, for having me leave your shop with a very happy belly and a little marinara sauce on my skirt.    Just a tip: this isn't visible from the street, but rather you need to walk into what looks like a professional building and stroll down a flight of stairs.  You'll be so glad you did!",

Arancinis are hard to come by in Pittsburgh, and can be found in areas with larger Sicilian populations like NY and Boston. Being a Bostonian who's lived next to the North End (Boston's Little Italy) most of my life, I have high standards when it comes to Italian food. The Arancini House is the real deal! This is place for some good Italian comfort food.",

We tried the Al Burro, a slice of plain pizza, a sausage and peppers roll, a pepperoni roll (which was a great, delicious twist on my home state's official food), wedding soup, wedge salad and tiramisu. All of it was delicious, but the arancini is what is the star of the show here. But what REALLY stands out at Arancini House are the people and the customer service. The owner is so friendly and personable and took the time to explain arancini to us and what each item was. Combine that with fresh, delicious food and reasonable prices and we can't wait to go back.",

Arancini House serves up Italian fried rice balls among other Italian items like pizza and rolls. You might have a hard time finding it because it's in the basement of a building. However, just look out for the signs and arrows.   Came here on a Friday night with the hubby and the small dining room was completely filled except one table. Perfect for us! The space is super casual and you order and pay at the counter. We ordered the Sicilian pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms and of course we couldn't come here without trying arancini (rice balls), which we got the stuffed hot pepper. One bite of the arancini and you are in heaven! Crispy outer shell, but the rice is so soft and moist and the flavors of the filling are absolutely perfect. Next time, I will get several and not just one! The pizza was also great; crispy outer crust yet soft and thick. Pizza wasn't too greasy. My one and only gripe is the mushrooms seemed like they were canned. What I loved most about this visit was the \"secret\" Calabrian pepper infused honey the owner brought out to us. This item is not on the menu but trust me, you're going to want to ask about it! The owners were inspired by Mike's Hot Honey so they made their own with Calabrian hot peppers. The honey is mildly spicy yet still very sweet and it's perfect on the pizza!!   I just wish they had late hours everyday. They are only open late (until 9 pm) on Thursdays and Fridays. Any other day, they're open until 5 pm except they're closed on Sundays and Mondays. Otherwise, I love this place and I will definitely be back!",

Lebanon is one of those places that I have left feeling truly excited about finding a gem of a place to get authentic amazing Sicilian food. We happened upon the small shop and were greeted by the most pleasant people.   We shared three different Arancini, two kinds of their rolls (think mini calzone) and a slice of pizza. Each thing was better than the last. Pizza is the best mix of a crust that both has a crunch and chew to it. Amazing sauce and cheese ratio and it doesn't help that it was hot and incredibly delicious. The Arancini are the best I've had at a restaurant hands down!   Please go, give it a try and bring your friends!! They do not disappoint.",

Both times we had no problem getting a table and there are high chairs. Awesome!  The food is fantastic!!! Authentic Sicilian! I had some questions about the arancini and compared them to a dish I had in Rome. They were able to explain the difference and the meaning of each of the words in Italian. It was fascinating!    My latest time there I had an classic arancini ball. It's a fried risotto ball with bolognese meat sauce and peas inside. The perfect size - the size of an orange - and was a filling meal when I added a cup of wedding soup. My son got a piece of plain pizza and devoured it. I had one bite and knew why! SO GOOD.   The set up is simple, order at the counter, grab a drink from the cooler. Easy and quick. The decor is so cute with lots of orange accents, which made a lot more sense when I found out the arancini means little oranges!   I highly recommend this for lunch or dinner!",

    "text": "Best Sicilian pizza around!   My husband and I have been on a search for good sicilian pizza for some time, and a friend suggested we check out Arancini House.   We stopped in on a Thursday evening and aside from another couple we had the dining room to ourselves. The place was clean, and one of the owners waited on us. He took his time and explained the menu to us, and told us all about Arancini (which apparently means \"orange\" in Italian).   Since we had been looking for pizza we decided to skip the arancini this time and order a Sicilian with pepperoni and mushroom. Unlike a previous reviewer mentioned, I noticed that the mushrooms were definitely FRESH, and not from a can or jar. Canned mushrooms are one of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to pizza, so I noticed right away that these were fresh! I was pretty happy about that! (I posted a picture as well)  The crust was well done too - cooked all the way through and crisp on the bottom and outside. The amount of toppings, sauce and cheese were perfect as well. Overall we were VERY happy with this pizza.   I also had a bowl of wedding soup which I was less excited about. It did not taste homemade or like anything special. Don't get me wrong, it was good... But it was just typical \"restaurant\" wedding soup.   The owner checked on us and cleared our table even though this isn't really a \"sit-down\" type place and he was working alone. He also told us about how they got the business started and his father-in-law's (who is co-owner and chef) cooking experience in Sicily. I appreciated him taking the extra time to chat and tell us about the food and culture.   The only down side is the hours (mostly early afternoons and closed on Sunday and Monday). I feel like this place would be CRAZY popular somewhere like Lawrenceville, or as a food truck.  Overall it was a really great experience and we can't wait to go back to try all the different arancini.",

This place is local to me so I go often. The staff is friendly, the food is always good and there's always a good selection of Arancini or rolls to pick from.  I really can't say enough good things.   I get the Banana Pepper Arancini often because I'm a sucker for banana peppers -- especially ones stuffed with sausage. My other go-to is the Panelle sandwich. It's also happens to be a tasty vegan option if that's what you're looking for. Don't overlook it because you don't know what it is: chick pea fritters on a homemade roll.",

It is on the Terrace Level of the Executive Building, which is below the ground level floor so it's a bit hard to find.  I think I've tried everything on the menu at this point and it's all delicious, although the Italian hoagie is a standout.  It's delicious.  To top it all off, everything's fairly affordable.  Give it a shot next time you're out to lunch in uptown.",

    "text": "This is one of the tastiest spots to visit in the South Hills. You'll find Arancini House within Mt. Lebanon's business district. You just have to keep your eyes peeled for their door and walk down stairs to their lower level location (I believe the elevators in the building can also get you there).  Arancini House is cozy and unassuming, but don't be fooled by their humble set-up. Behind the counter are some of the friendliest staffers I've ever spoken to. They love answering questions and chatting with their customers. And they make fantastic, freshly baked food!  They offer a nice selection of arancini, including a weekly rotation of veggie options. I'm especially fond of the Al Burro (Bechamel cream sauce, prosciutto di cotto, peas). Also available for diners are wedding soup, a couple salads and fried appetizers, sandwiches, and homemade dessert. And of course, their generous helpings of pizza!   I highly recommend stopping in here and exploring the menu at your own pace. At least one arancini is a must, of course. Just be ready to come back for more - in my experience these tasty treats are filling and satisfying!",

Despite being fried in front of me, the filling wasn't quite hot enough, and didn't have as strong a flavor as it looked like it would. The rice did have a really nice flavor, although I would have liked it to be a bit more towards grains than porridge. I didn't try any rolls or pizza, which might be excellent, but it seems fair to judge by a namesake.",

The owners came around to check on everyone- they were so friendly and we we learned they were from an area in Sicily that we had visited.

Luckily I had an hour in my parking spot left and decided to give it a go. I am of Sicilian heritage and have never even heard of arancini. Basically a fried risotto ball stuffed with some seriously delicious stuff. I was very grateful that they were serving vegetarian versions because it seemed like a traditionally meat filled ball.   The two working when I went in were so incredibly friendly and helpful. I was walked through every dish they had and everything was explained. They even explained how their pizza had both a crunch and a chew (they were correct about that by the way). I couldn't decide between the arancini and pizza so I decided to be gluttonous and get both!   The first thing I noticed was how rich it was but also that neither item was overly salty. Having a slice of pizza that is not covered in salt made me realize that most every other slice of pizza I have had in my life was over-salted. Incredible, fresh tasting ingredients went into both dishes. You have a great view of everything happening in the kitchen, which was immaculate. I was very impressed and will wbe returning.",

We were initially spoiled by having arancini in Palermo's famous street markets, so we were delighted to find that the ones at Arancini House are truly on par with the ones in Palermo. They're actually better than several that we had in bakeries/ fast-food spots in Sicily, to be honest. We loved that this spot has plenty of vegetarian options, including the fanastic Caprese arancini and the panelle (fried chickpea fritters) sandwich, which along with tater tots, came with plenty of lemon to really give the panelle the perfect flavor. We also took home a piece of delicious lemon mascarpone cake. The owner was incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, and clearly wants diners to have the best experience possible (which we did). BYOB with no corking fee is a great bonus. We will absolutely be back for more arancini, and to try the egpplant roll, pizza, and other desserts. Arancini House was a home run for us!",

Had the original, banana pepper and the spinach which were all phenomenal.  Started with the Italian wedding soup, which was tasty and with just enough meat and pasta.  Was sorry I did not order a salad after I saw them in the display case.  Finished with the lemoncello cake that was awesome.
