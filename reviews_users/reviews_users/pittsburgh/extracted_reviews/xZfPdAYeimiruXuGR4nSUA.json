    "text": "I'm so glad we have the Food Co-Op in Pittsburgh. Although still fairly expensive, it's less than Whole Foods, and I don't do all my shopping here, just the things I have a hard time finding elsewhere. The bulk selection is one of the best I've ever seen, and I truly appreciate the salad bar on busy days. Their choices are more on the crunchy/hippie side than the high-end gourmet side of things, and it's nice to shop for vegetables without having to turn something down because it's not organic...most of the produce is. The staff is helpful and friendly, and, if someone doesn't know an answer to a question, which can happen with a volunteer, he or she will find out for you. On member 10% discount days it can get very busy, so go early or late.",

The potatoes and garbanzo bean patties are amazing.  The prices are pretty much in line with any smaller heath and local food oriented grocer. I can usually count on them to have specific items that Whole Foods is sold out of and sometimes at a better price. Plus, the Co-op hot bar is a million times better than the Whole Foods hot bar - quality over quantity all the way.  Short lines, great staff, good for Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "This is sort of a niche place for me. It's a bit too expensive for the average person, I think (and yes i understand that it's a co-op, etc. but it doesn't change that it's probably middle to upper class prices by comparison), but it does offer some deals. It's the best place to buy spices because they're sold in bulk, and if you want to try something new or only need a little for a recipe, you don't have to buy a whole bottle. There is an entire aisle of spices, spice blends and dried herbs, so there is a lot to choose from. It's also great to buy a little at a time because you can make sure your spices are always fresh. Same goes for the bulk food bins, though probably half of them are the 9,000 flavors of granola they stock.  The salad bar has great variety. The hot food bar, not so much. It runs out quickly, and it's too easy to run up a high tab if the good stuff is weighty. I'm not a fan of most of the packaged fresh food in the deli case. The stuffed grape leaves are not good, and a lot of the other things seem sort of bland to me.  There's an extensive vitamins and supplements section, with pretty much any herbal supplement you'd want. The produce section is expensive, but almost always very fresh.",

I like the bulk goods and spices because you can take as much as you need, you get the spices whole and they put them in big jars so you can sniff them if you want before you buy (the downside to that is that every time the jars get opened the spices probably lose some oils), and there's a huge selection.   This place has my quinoa, pearled barley, spelt flour, and nutritional yeast.   Some of the vegetables pop out at me and I'm tempted to buy a lemon or some really ripe piece of fruit. Usually I don't though. During the summer they were selling fresh herbs in pots. That was really tempting. Once they sold kittens. That was amazing.   It doesn't hurt that its right by the climbing wall, fencing, gymnastics, and bike shop.",

    "text": "I've been going to the East End Food Co-op for several years now.  There's something appealing about supporting the small, locally member-owned food stores that appeals to me.  The Coop was updated several years ago to help it keep up with the competition- Whole Foods mostly.  The renovation expanded the size of the Coop, and also made room for more product- all good things.  The larger front doors and a more prominent showcase of the fresh veggies and fruits, make for a more noticeable, and inviting entrance.  Since the renovation, and increased competition, the store seems to have been able to keep up with other organic and alternative food stores in the area.  Along with an expanded fresh fruit and vegetable section, you will find large bins (self-serve style) filled with everything from brown rice pasta, to organic nuts, beans and legumes.  It's nice to be able to select small amounts of seeds and other items as you need them.  Also available are homemade peanut butters (almond, cashew, and regular peanut) which are delicious and creamy- several varieties of local honey are also within reach.  One of my favorite things about the East End Food Coop is the salad bar.  During the summer I like to make myself a salad with sunflower seeds, peppers, red onions, and feta cheese, spinach; take it to the park, and have lunch.  If you like juice, and protein shakes, you won't be disappointed- the flavorful and creative creations made in the bar area are among the best I have had anywhere. The refrigerated section of the store is vast, and includes organic milk and cheese, soy ice cream (as well as regular) and several kinds of tofu.  Their humus is creamy, with lots of tahini, garlic and lemon juice.  You'll also find tabouleh, homemade sandwiches, and colossal cookies.  If you're a fan of dark chocolate, there's plenty of that too.   The only thing about the Coop that isn't great, are the bathrooms.  They are always dirty, and furthermore, smell awful.  You can't be clean in unclean bathrooms.  I hope that the management at the Coop will address this issue, and soon.",

It embraces its east end neighborhood, makes amazing products available to the community, and in general feels like it cares, which is the only acceptable vibe for anything calling itself a cooperative! I mostly go here for the juices, honestly, but I'll tell you why: EEFC is literally the only place in Pittsburgh proper to get your hands on some straight, non-pastuerized juicer juice. Why is this not a thing here?! Even the Whole Foods is lacking a juice bar!! Seems juice is the new Pittsburgh Mexican food. Sheesh!",

The same goes for the spices--such a bargain!  The Juice bar has great smoothies and juices--they're a little pricier than I'm used to, but great for a bit of a splurge!",

It's also stocked with the best produce anywhere in the city in the winter months when Giant Eagle's selection looks beat up.  The prepared foods case in the back is deliciously weird.  And it's locally owned/operated, so you're not exactly sending your hard earned money to Whole Food's CEO.  The membership is lifetime, apparently, which the employees always kind of failed to express; I thought you had to pay for it yearly, and the difference is pretty big.   That said, I live far enough away that getting here regularly still doesn't justify the membership.",

I love the bulk section, especially since I can choose the quantity of what I want to buy.  Super convenient for travelers.  You can buy pasta, granolla, flour, quinoa, cous cous, cane sugar, spices, YERBA MATE!!!, dried fruit, nuts, olive oil, peanut & almond butter, soap.....man, I could go on & on.  You can buy all of that stuff & choose how much you want of it.    I was suprised that they had cacao powder, for such a small place.  They have a nice little section of tofu, tempeh, & seitan next to a bunch of vegan cheese that looked really good.    They also have a juice bar & vegetarian \"cafe.\"  I don't think I'd call it a cafe, more like buffet.  I wasn't all that impressed with the food they had cooked, but I'm not going to penalize them for that.  For such a small place it's pretty amazing what they already have going on there.  I really want to try something from their juice bar too!!    There must be someone dj'ing the music in the store because I heard some great music that you wouldn't hear on the radio.  Everyone was very curteous and nice.  I should try to make friends with these people since I'm new in town.",

There are other options to this store like for instance Whole Foods which is only 8 min away. Whole foods has very often sales which this one doesn't.   Also there was a strange old/rotten smell going through the Co-Ops place - indicator something is wrong.  I think they are owned by 8000 members, so enough people spreading the word that they are great.  But the truth is - its an expensive store with big attitude, and very little to offer.",

They carry my beloved Temptations soy ice cream even in chocolate chip cookie dough. Nummers! I grabbed delicious produce, a spinach and feta & olives-zaatar pie made by Najat's Cuisine, a STILL WARM ginger cookie made there, a raspberry ginger beer, and I'm sure I am forgetting something. I would come here all the time if I lived in Pittsburgh. Their hot food looked good, but I wanted something to grab and go.

Absolutely GREAT bulk section with a wide variety of grains, legumes, and pastas.  Killer cookies and baked goods.   On the other hand--if I lived on my own, I could do all my shopping here.  But, since I don't--I can't.  It's tough to stock a household kitchen solely from the EEFC--I mean, I can't really afford to regularly buy $15 laundry detergent.   Realistically, the Co-op can't serve most of us for one-stop shopping.  But it's worth it to put down a few extra pennies for potatoes or juice to support a genuinely community-oriented business.",

I randomly found out about East End when I was doing a search for organic, local food products. We decided to go check it out and instantly fell in love. Their produce selection is second-to-none, seriously. And yes, I am including Giant Eagle in that!  Seriously, just about every time we've gone all the produce looks so fresh and brightly colored (i.e., the peppers, tomatoes, fruits, etc.) and ripe. I also like how they carry pasta noodles, rice, and other fun things in bulk. We always lament about how since there's only the two of us, we don't always need the large offerings that you usually find at places like Giant Eagle. Being able to pick out just the amount you need and not letting anything go to waste makes me feel a lot better.  Beyond the food products, I have also gotten into making my own body washes. East End carries all of the ingredients that I need with multiple options. They have recently redone their store (and are still renovating) and have expanded their meat (they didn't use to carry meat at all) and cheese selections tremendously. The meat is a little pricey, actually the whole store is little pricey, but in my opinion it is well worth it. It's nice knowing that the items are organic and come from sustainable farms. Bonus: they buy as much locally produced items as they can as well.   I really have nothing bad to say about them. The service has always been great and I love the selections and products offered. I can't comment on the cafe as I haven't eaten at it, but I hear the food is great. A combination of East End and the Strip has pretty much replaced Giant Eagle for me. I only stop by there now if I'm close by and just need a few items really quick.",

First, it's not bad, for what it is. I like trader Joe's better, I like whole foods better, but this place had stuff I use that the other don't.  Nice produce section, items seemed fresh, and plentiful. Mostly organic, and I do like how they label things \"local\" so that we can help our local farmers, and growers.   Great juice bar, salad bar, and hot lunch items. Everything looked appetizing.  Great spice and herb section, I bought some freshly ground ginger and some wonderful sweet and smoked paprikas.   Good vegan section, tofurkey brands and lightlife products. Good dairy section too, their prices for soy milk is a bit outrageous.  That said, the east end food co op is a good place to shop for the pantry.",

I never get it with garlic even though you should. I can't handle that much garlic in a drink. I'm a wuss.   Hot foods was bumpin' but I was still able to stroll around and decide on what Indian Kitchen cookery would go in the belly for dinner. A little tofu surprise, chickpea curry, steamed kale, steamed veggies with big slices of zucchini, and a few red lentil scoops. Everything looked fresh and delicious. After grabbing 2 soups and my dinner I downed my sweet wheat grass shot and was ready to get home. At the register they forgot to ring up the shot but I had to let them know. All smiles as I left.

I also love buying grains, beans, etc. from the bulk bins, fair trade products and many daily food items like cereals, nut butters, snacks, etc. They now stock meat/poultry from local farms and specialize in Vegan options.

The beet hummus is to die for and the wraps are incredible. I also like the beauty section and natural makeup and night creams.   Yes, some stuff can be pricer that Trader Joes's, like the Amy's frozen pizzas, but it is so worth it becasue you know that the extra $ is going towards a good cause.

I would like to see a better listing of which meat is grass fed and grass finished, as many of the farms in the frozen meat section did not have any of that information.

A few individual employees are pleasant and competent, but the organization overall has some serious issues with ethics/transparency.

    "text": "The co-op is an invaluable resource for Pittsburgh.   First of all, the selection is fantastic. No matter what kind of health-conscious diet you follow from vegan to paleo - they've got what you need. My favorite items here that you can't really find many other places are raw milk (legal in PA, woo!) and the local meats. The prices on the meat here are higher than most butchers in the area, but on par with the lesser quality meats at Whole Foods - choose your co-op!  I seldom find the produce prices to be ridiculously high. For example, I recently purchased mushrooms at $1.99 per lb. and strawberries for $2.50 per lb., which seem to be two of the more expensive items at any given store. Their sales are worth planning a shopping trip around.  When I followed a plant-based diet, the bulk section was my holy grail. For grains, flours, nuts, and seeds, they have a wide variety of unique products. I also love that you can fill a jar and buy it right at the store - most other bulk sections in the 'Burgh don't have this.  All in all, I like being able to go into a store and not have to sift through the produce to see if it's what I want (organic, local) because it all is! Naturally, they do sell tropical fruits and things that simply do not grow here, but everything is very clearly labeled in its origin and growing method.  The employees are always friendly and helpful as well. The only terrible thing about this place is the fact that there is almost NEVER parking - I've parked in the lot maybe  ten times out of the ~40 or so times that I've shopped here. I don't mind the walk down, but with heavy bags in my hand, the walk up the street can be tough!",

My interest in the food there was a little curbed by the prices which you could easily beat at  a regular grocery store. However, the raw milk and goat milk there was an interesting find though!

This all changed yesterday when I was desperate for a healthy smoothie and nowhere near one.   We were a little confused as to how to get into the co-op, because didn't realize that it was on the opposite street all tucked away. After we figured that out by following another patron, we were really excited to walk through the doors.   If you've never been into a co-op, you should know that they are typically smooshed together and have an interesting smell that emanates from the bulk-spices isle. I love this smell. It's really the best grocery store smell, EVER.  Proceeding through the store we noticed the colorful and abundant produce section. So many beautiful fruits, veggies and herbs. The prices varied, but they were probably on par with what you would pay for any other organic produce somewhere else.   When we found the back area with hot foods, cold foods and the smoothies...I died of happiness. There were so many wonderful things back there. The food bar is $7.99 a pound, which is a lot cheaper than some places! The smoothies were all very tasty sounding, but I settled on a smoothie with soy ice cream, strawberries and papaya juice. Oh, my, god. It was so delicious! My boyfriend got the King smoothie, and he really enjoyed his too.  Right beside the smoothie bar there is a section for all kinds of books. My eye was caught by an organic and local homebrewing book. It is now on my list of must haves!   The rest of the store was great. I especially love the cheese selection (we bought AMAZING and LOCAL tomato-basil havarti), the vegan meat products and the prices.   I'll definitely be coming here a lot more. It's a great little co-op, and it is definitely the best I have been in!",

A recent election was just botched to the point where they threw out votes. Why does this matter? It matters because they provide direction and governance to the management team. If the Board is bumbling about there is an impact on all operations. I have found this to be the case with the 10 year plus talk about a second location or major improvements to current location. The latter btw is impossible due to other tenant issues. So, MOVE. Instead years of inaction and lip service. Deliveries are tough and parking tougher. Considering that 90% of visits are by car this is a problem. Produce is often in poor condition or simply just not there. At my last visit a few weeks ago they were out of bottled spring water (common) and mac and cheese boxes...think about that...mac and cheese...water. Not watercress - water. So, I am keep my membership out of principle, but my consumer dollars will be going elsewhere and hoping for change.

So many local options, such good produce, and awesome prepared foods.  Sure some of the prices are high, but if you learn to shop it, there are also great values everywhere.   And I really appreciate that they stick their neck out, and are spending time and money in the fight to label GMO's.  It's important issues like this that really define our Co-op IMO.",

Even now that I live in the North Hills I still enjoy to seek out the East End Food Co-op on a semi-regular basis.  I go there for the bulk bins mainly, but always end up grabbing some other things.  Their fresh fruit and vegetable selection is always good and cheaper than Whole Foods and Market District for sure.  I am a gigantic fan of their whole coffee bean selection as well.  Very good place.  And not swarming with hippies all the time, though that's not that bad of a thing.",

I originally went the first time to get some essential oils, but left with that and then some! I've been back quite a few times since then and I can't get enough!  I get a little overwhelmed when I go in if I dont have a very specific list (and even then, if you're not familiar with the products or choices, it can be confusing) but I do love to go in and just explore.. It's really a little piece of heaven for any health food lover.  I love their selections of dairy products and meats as well.. theres also a great supplement section.. I could go on and on, but you get it.  This place is a diamond in the rough and I love it!",

My favorite juice combo is the carrot, apple, and ginger, aka \"Ginger Wabbit\".  Although they can be a little pricey, certain juices are sometimes on special, so keep your eye out!  They also have plenty of smoothie and coffee bar options if juices and wheat grass shots aren't really your thing.  Don't be afraid to ask the staff member for some recommendations!  The hot food/salad bar has great vegetarian and vegan options.  Usually the selections include roasted veggies, homemade soups, tofu and tempeh options, kale, and some kind of grain.  On the back wall of the store, they have a selection of already packaged salads, sandwiches, mock tuna and chicken salad, hummus, marinated tofu, great to grab and go or enjoy for lunch in the cafe.  I can't comment much on the store selection, because I mostly stick to the prepared foods and juice bar.  They also have a large selection of nutritional bars, including the local companies such as Barre and NuGo.  Don't be intimidated to give East End Food Co-op a shot, the staff is totally helpful and the healthy, fresh lunch options are worth stopping in for!",

    "text": "Oh my gosh I was like a little kid on Christmas the first time I went into the store. There is simply no other place to buy your certified organic goods in the Pittsburgh surroundings. This includes make-up, produce, nail polish, toiletries, Chapstick, face wash, and everything else you would normally find in a grocery store-- only nearly all of it is organic!   I can't tell you how long I have been looking for a place like this and even though it's slightly pricier than Trader Joe's/Whole Foods (or just about the same), I don't know about you, but I would rather pay for the quality of my food than for a name-brand jar of salsa.  One of the things that I liked most, is that they indicate on the glass of the hot food bar, which ingredients are organic- which I think is fabulous, because we have a right to know what we are eating! They sell Teatree oil, rosewater, and other bamboo cosmetic supplies. Almost all of their spices are organic, and they have a cafe where you can enjoy food that you might order fresh from the bar. I wish they would open up more places like this in the surrounding Pittsburgh area. This is nothing that others haven't stated already, but the only downfall, in my opinion, is the small parking lot. I don't even care- I will still give it five stars because I'm just that in love and I hope you will be too.",

I was diagnosed with a soy allergy last year, so I was truly like a little kid in a candy store at East End Food Co-Op. There are so many options that not only accommodate my annoying food allergy but also support incredible local businesses.  For my first East End visit, I snagged several items, including incredible locally-made challah bread, three types of flavorful locally-harvested honey, cognac fig cheese, and my favorite amy's pizza in pesto, a flavor that I have never found elsewhere. Thankfully, I was shopping without a basket or cart, or I would have spent well over $100 on my first trip. Instead, I was trying to balance all my great finds in my arms, which limited my purchases.  My one warning about East End... don't expect Aldi or Trader Joe's prices here. Like Whole Foods, you'll be spending $50 or more on just a bad or two of groceries. Just remember that you're supporting multiple local businesses when shopping here, and you'll leave feeling fulfilled about your money spent!",

But going to the co-op is a different experience than most grocery stores. The co-op serves a broader purpose. I love several things about the EEFC: first the people that work there are friendly, diverse, and caring. Second, the selection is curated to provide options that are more sustainable and nutritious. Third, and most important to me, the atmosphere is unlike more grocery stores; it's pace is a bit slower, it's definitely not a super market (but the selection is still diverse), and it's more relaxed. Fourth, they're cafe is great; I often take my daughter here for breakfast. The only caveat is price: you will generally spend more money here than Giant Eagle, TJs, or Aldi, but the quality and experience is superior.",

There is a good selection of fruits and veggies, as well as toiletries (shampoos, soaps, toothpaste, tampons, shaving creams, etc.) to household cleaning products. The frozen section is also very diverse with a good selection of frozen meals, ice cream (dairy and nondairy), and veggies. The Co-op also carries a nice selection of foods for people with restricted diets especially for Celiac and vegans, or for people with severe allergies like myself.   They also carry hard to find vegan cheeses such as Treeline that I have difficulty finding at WF in Pittsburgh and the Co-op in West Virginia. I was also happy to find that they had my favorite Ito-En sencha green tea shot (it's just green tea in a can, it's not like one of those energy shots at all).   The deli is also fantastic, and I highly recommend the Co-op deli over the WF deli. There are a wide variety of soups and salads and dressings. The vegan mushroom soup is really, really, really yummy. There are also vegan meals in ready to go containers (salads, vegan pesto noodle salad, etc.). You can also order coffee/espresso at the deli counter. As with any good Co-op, they have a variety of non-dairy milk options.   If you have food allergies or have any dietary restrictions the Co-op is an excellent place to get a quick meal (hot or cold) and to pick up groceries. There is also a little dining/sitting area at the front of the store. It's kid friendly and they even have a little compost/recycling bin! Yes, this is important for me to mention because I come from Seattle where recycling is the norm and we get fined if we don't recycle..and recycling does not seem to be a big thing in WV where I currently live.   There is also a community board if you are looking to post something up (events, classes, pet sitting, etc.) near the bathroom in the back of the store.",

One of the most important things to me is to have the availability of local produce (outside the traditional farmer's markets, that happen primarily in the summer around here) and be able to buy in bulk.  I used to live further east, and would travel the hour, with a baby, to shop at the co-op.  The $100 life-time membership is so worth the benefits.  I'm not sure what to say about the co-op other than JUST GO THERE!  Its a whole different way of shopping for many people in this area.  I feel like I'm giving back to the community every time I go there.  Also, if you're in need of that hard-to-find supplement your doc is talking about, the co-op probably has it.  The selection of local dairy and eggs are really great too.  Although the co-op is definitely pricier than your typical big box store, you get what you pay for.  And, there are tons of sales, coupons and specials each month.  I will always be a faithful member of the co-op.  Oh!  And the cafe is awesome!  I love the juices and smoothies, and the salad bar and hot foods rival all.  Its the only buffet-style place I can go to where I know I can eat practically everything (ovo-lacto vegetarian).  I love going for a bite, then doing my shopping.  Then, I'm not so hungry while shopping that I buy everything in site!!!!",

Having frequented a mom/pop place exactly like this back home in NYC, the Co-op gives me that good ol' homey feel, here in my new Pgh digs. The fresh produce is organic, locally sourced, and varied. There's oils, honeys, grains, nuts, candies, spices, oh my! to buy in weight for exactly the amount you need, (see my pics). They've got a vegetarian buffet, I've have had their breakfast which is quite good, I crave it time to time. There's also a salad bar, cheese and charcuterie section, and a smoothie bar. You can get fresh coffee and pastries to go with, including gluten free options. Meat, seafood, dairy, health/beauty products including makeup, and pet products are also available. They don't have the extensive variety of Whole Foods, but they are not slim pickings either. There's lots of unique items to try or experiment with. They're also pricier than WF, but you can definitely find things reasonably priced. There's a small dining area in the front where you can sit and eat too. There's a parking lot but spots can be hard to find, given it's shared with neighboring businesses. The employees are friendly and seem to enjoy working there. Give it a try and support this small local business!",

Then the other day I wandered into East End (which is actually closer to my new apartment) and see I needn't have worried.  When I first heard the name, I imagined East End would be a dusty, incensey-smelling place full of turnips, staffed by people clothed in Birkenstocks and clothing made entirely out of scarves.  I could not have been more wrong.  East End blows away any Trader Joe's, Whole Foods or any other health food/grocery store I have ever seen. It is extremely well-stocked with amazing produce and food that makes me literally *want* to eat healthy and, heck, even to exercise (so I can eat more of their good ingredients).  And the stuff seems to be sold at normal (not Whole Paycheck) prices.  My favorite part was at the back there was a salad and hot food bar.  I tried this spicy sausage soup (made with ToFurkey Italian Sausages).  It was AMAZING!  I cannot wait to make it for my extremely non-vegetarian parents and not tell them I used vegan sausages!",

A membership is $100, which can be paid in 4 installments. It's a lifetime share in the co-op and completely refundable. You don't need a membership to shop, however it grants you a 2% discount, plus a quarterly 10% discount on an item of your choice.   The volunteer program was dropped in 2014, which I find disappointing, but that's a Nationwide trend.  The co-op is a friendly place, and they offer some programs. During my recent visit, I discovered many modern updates I was not expecting. It's a fun place to shop and offers wonderful and healthy products, such as local honey.",

Poor to even worse parking, in the basement of an old industrial building. Barely any accommodation for PD or elderly drivers.  I have extensive experience with the Ithaca NY co-op as well as several in VT. If you go to one of those you can see what a poor store this one is. They have a pretty decent selection, but items drop from their line-up with alarming frequency so it's hard to depend on that. Prices are high. I've found myself shopping here less and less as time goes by. Pity. The credit union could be of great service but instead it's barely there. It's also \"E\" rated by an independent rating agency (E as in not passing, not for \"excellent\"). There is a lot of room to improve this place but the board and staff seem pretty close minded and like it just the way it is.",

Not sure why it had taken me so long to motivate myself to enter these doors, but it finally happened.  Many of my friends have talked about this place and how great every product is within.  Not sure, but I just didn't believe that at first.    Walking in I was surprised.  It reminded me of the old markets that I grew up with.  A lot of freshness held within with a cozy feel.  While walking the aisles I was seeing items I had no idea existed.  It finally hit me that this might be the place I want to be shopping at due to my long list of allergies.  It was like a light bulb lit up above my head.  While my friend was obtaining the items he needed I went on my way and decided to read the labels of a few items.  I am so happy to have found this oasis in the city.  Big bonus for me, they have Jeni's Splendid ice cream, straight from Columbus, OH.",

    "text": "I have lived close by to the co-op for a little over a year, and I do the majority of my grocery shopping here (probably about 80%--I also shop at Aldi, Trader Joe's, and Whole Foods periodically; they all have their assets).   Probably the co-op's greatest assets are its local produce and friendly environment. First, while the produce can be expensive (usually for good reason considering the quality and origins of the produce), some produce is very well-priced. For example, there are bins of local mushrooms that you buy by the pound; if you compare those prices per pound to the pre-packaged containers at other grocery stores, it's an incredible deal. I also tend to shop the produce on sale; there's usually always something. Sometimes the deals are downright crazy (e.g. $1.25 for a pink of organic blackberries or $1 for a bag of onions). Second, all of the co-op employees I've interacted with have been very friendly and helpful. In general, the store has a friendly vibe. Even on weekends, I've never found the co-op to be as overwhelming as other grocery stores.   As others have said, the bulk items are unique and useful. There are also good deals to be had there. I also enjoy the bakery items; I don't have any dietary restrictions, but they certainly aim to cater to those with specialized diets (e.g. gluten free, vegan, nut allergies).   As for drawbacks, I find them pretty minimal. The parking lot can get crowded, but again, I don't think it's worse than any other grocery stores in the area. I also tend to avoid buying some pantry staples (e.g. vinegar) and snacks (e.g. chips, crackers) here because the same quality can be found cheaper at other places. I'm used to going to different stores for different needs though, so this is not a big deal for me.",

    "text": "There are two main sets of reasons for liking Co-ops in general and the East End Food Co-op in particular.  The first is instrumental--price, quality, wide selection, location, etc. The second has to do with your values. If you don't like agribusiness and greedy corporations, Co-operative shopping is a great alternative that works. Our Co-op, which I joined decades ago, is the crown jewel of Pittsburgh's progressive community.      Some items cost more. One reason among many is that our employees are paid a living wage. A guaranteed way to bring prices down is to do more of your shopping at the Co-op. This will bring about growth and consequent economies of scale.   <a href=\"https://www.yelp.com/biz/east-end-food-co-op-pittsburgh\">yelp.com/biz/east-end-fo...</a>",

The store itself is not very big, so I can imagine it can get crowded here on the weekends. It was nice to have an escape from the traditional grocery stores to come here. They have a drink bar with coffee and smoothies and juices. They have so many local goodies including TONS of produce, meats, dairy items, and baked goods. Their selection of sprouts was really impressive and they were all so fresh. They have tons of kombucha, including those giant GT bottles- I have never seen them anywhere else but here. This is the perfect spot if you're looking for something in particular, or have a special occasion. I am looking forward to returning!",

The bulk food section is awesome from all types of organic flour to organic candy, granola, rice, pasta, teas, coffee, even bulk tamari. You can bring your own container and fill it up. If not, bags and containers are available. All different types of vegan (as well as some non-vegan) canned goods, soymilks, vegan cheeses, and meat substitutes are available. There is so much crammed into the place sometimes its hard to find what you need, but staff is very friendly and are always there to help. It doesn't have the glitz and glam of Whole Foods but the prices are a little better. If you become a member, once a month you can purchase items at a pretty good discount.",

So, I'm on my dinner break sitting, chatting it up with a co worker while eating.  I see something white in the spinach just before putting it in my mouth.  WTF is that!  OMG, it looks like one of those fat ass worms we'd  pluck from the greens in my grandma's garden.  I threw the fork down and my co worker says...\" you're seeing stuff.\"  Um NOT!  I sat there digging through the spinach determined to find that damn worm.  Thirty minutes later  SHAZAM...found it. Ugh, my coworker spread open the spinach leaf.  EEEkkkk, it was bigger and fatter with black spikes poking out.  FUCK!  Call the manager at Co-op and he says...\"Bring it in for a refund, thanks for being so nice about it...We usually just see worms in the fruits.\"  Geez, thanks for that lil tidbit.    This happened last week around the Sept 14, 2010.  Guess that means it's really organic, huh?",

Life is good here! If I was raking in more moolah, I would shop here more frequently, but Trader Joe's prices are a little bit more reasonable (and the food there is a little bit more \"mainstream\" for my significant other).

My normal experience with co-ops includes massive amounts of produce, dairy, baked goods, and meats. Not here though; instead it's like a co-op in miniature. Even the mozzarella I was looking for came only in tiny olive-sized balls. Don't get me wrong - I fully support the existence of a co-op, especially in an area like the East End, but to be honest, I think a trip to the Strip District would be much more productive shopping-wise.",

This tragic fault does not rest with the co-op, of course, but with the state of Pennsylvania.  But you probably don't care because you know where all of these elusive \"beer distributors\" are located.  So, to get back on track, I like the local produce focus here, and some of the cheeses appeared to be local, as well.  Nice staff, decent prices, good little salad bar.

It's been in the community for years and I feel good knowing I'm shopping somewhere local and cooperatively owned. They aren't the biggest grocer around, but they do have a nice selection and it's good quality food and it's definitely clean too. The produce is fresh and the variety is nice too. They also have a salad bar and hot food selection that are very tasty. They have a cooler section that has prepared food as well that is pretty great. They have a lemon pepper tofu sandwich that is absolutely amazing! The prices are decent... they're slightly higher for some things (but not all!) compared to a commercial grocery store, but they're cheaper than whole foods and I believe the quality is worth the tiny bit extra. They also offer lose (not prepackaged) goods such as nuts, granola, beans, teas, herbs, etc... that I really like. It's a fantastic place to go if you are vegan or vegetarian, but even if you are neither and just enjoy high quality and local food it's a place I certainly recommend. The parking lot and street parking gets a bit full at time and it can be a little tricky getting a spot at certain times, but I don't think that should hold anyone back form going.",
