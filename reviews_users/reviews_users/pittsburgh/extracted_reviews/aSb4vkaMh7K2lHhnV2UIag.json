We go in sit down and ordered some food. I ordered the Special Village Beef Shish Kebab and my friend ordered the Chicken Kebab and Lamb Gyro combo dish.   Needless to say we were very pleased. The beef Shish kebabs were great! The meat was tender and it wasn't dry. The rice was tasty and wasn't dry as well. Same goes for my friends dish. The sauces were really good. There was a spicy brown sauce (didn't catch the name) that was amazing!   The baklava was also delicious!",

Also there are very few tables and the place is fairly crowded and busy. It's a byob place and they have a couple tables outside for outdoor seating.",

It was not 'bad', but I felt like I just paid 'meat prices' for what was essentially a lettuce wrap.  With so many other restaurants around, my advice to them would be:  Don't cut corners, because in the end you'll lose more money from lost business than what you'd save by skimping on meat.  Service was friendly - server was not slow, but the kitchen seemed a little slow all things considered.  Atmosphere was ok.  I won't be back.",

Turkish Kebab House was definitely the right choice. Probably the best gyro I've ever had. Seriously. Loved it. The lamb gyro was presented on a plate with lettuce with bread on the side. And hell, it was just as good as a salad. Seriously, get the lamb. So as I stop rambling on about good lamb, take a chance and try out this little place. Be cultured and adventurous, it'll be worth it. Normally I'm not but hey, it's a good New Years resolution to try more things.",

The place is quite small and can accommodate no more than 20-30 people at once. I ordered the chicken adana wrap which was really reasonably priced (7.5$). I was given yogurt sauce and hot sauce on the side, both of which were delicious. The wrap itself was quite tasty and the chicken was well made and favorable. It was definitely as tasty as other Mediterranean joints in the area. I ordered a baklawa in the end, which was priced at 5$ (but contained 4 pieces) and was quite nice too.

I knew I would keep coming back. However, in more recent visits, they've either run out of the kofte if it was toward evening/night time, or they simply did not have it available (even during lunch hours). This is pretty disappointing because their kofte is amazing and it is my go-to choice. Because of this, I'm going to have to deduct a point from service. When they don't have kofte available, I settle for the adana, which is drier than the kofte and not nearly as good. I wish they would consistently have the kofte, not just 50% of the time. I used to love this place, but now I just go in hoping they have what I want to order. Also, do not get the eggplant spread and if you are planning on getting the hummus, don't expect too much of it. On a brighter note, the Turkish coffee is very good. Definitely give it a try!  Taste | 4 Atmosphere | 3.5 Presentation | 3 Service | 2 OVERALL | 3",

The service in the restaurant is great and every take out order is perfectly packed, with nothing out of place or missing. I always open my take-out containers to delicious, steaming hot food. Its not the fanciest Turkish or Mediterranean restaurant I've visited, but it's clean with good service, and is definitely my favorite in Pittsburgh.   I most often order the cold mix appetizer. I usually order tabule, hummus, babaghanoush, and the eggplant spread. The sampler always comes with stuffed grape leaves and the other options you can order (bean salad, etc) are also very good. I've also had the shrimp entree and everything was seasoned and cooked perfectly. I also typically order a Turkish coffee if I'm eating in the restaurant, but have been disappointed with it tasting burnt on a few occasions. My table mates usually get the lamb or chicken Adana and always enjoy it.   I think that if you're craving good Turkish food, then you should check out Turkish Kabob House.",

I lived in Turkey for couple years, and sometimes miss their food, this place is the BEST TURKISH AND MEDITERRANEAN CUISINE in Pittsburgh, believe me, I tried all of them...  Ouu and fish!! If you like fish, you should try it!!! Sooo Nice!! I will add a picture of fish later!!!",

I waited for the management and he first tried to say that you are here too early. I showed him that I was supposed to be here in 20 minutes and we are in time and you are asking me to wait 30 -45 minutes. Regardless you are not going to have the table in time. He basically said sorry, there is nothing I can do.  And meanwhile, they had a large table and two small tables ready but instead of keeping them for us, they gave them to other people that came after us.  The management was basically first trying to make it our mistake and then he didn't even try to fix the problem as soon as possible.  Long story short, very poor management",

I whipped out my Yelp app and saw that I'd bookmarked Turkish Kebab House, so I suggested it, and my friends were game.  Seeing that they were open, we headed across the street to check it out.  Since it was lunch, all of us ordered wraps.  In light of the name of this establishment, I ordered the chicken kebab wrap ($8), and my two friends each ordered the mersin tantuni wrap ($7).  I didn't try their wrap, so I can't comment on it, but as one of them is a Yelper, I'm sure she'll review it separately.  As for my wrap, I was quite pleased with it in terms of flavor and portion.  The chicken was cooked well, and was nicely complemented by the crisp veggies.  We were also provided with homemade hot sauce and yogurt cucumber sauce as condiments.  The hot sauce wasn't too much to my taste (this is probably a personal preference, however), but I loved the yogurt sauce, which I applied liberally to my wrap.  Service was about what I'd expect for a place like this--not too fast or slow, or too attentive or inattentive--so no complaints there.  The ambiance is a step up from the former tenant occupying this space (Pizza Cono), with photos of sights from Turkey adorning the wooden accented maroon walls.  Overall, I was quite pleased with my experience here, and would definitely be willing to return for dinner sometime.",

And because it's so good, I have only occasionally has something else from their menu. The meat in the kebab is marinates with the flavorful Adnana spices and the wrap come with two sauces---a hot, spicy, orange colored sauce and a yogurt based sauce, resembling the Indian \"raita\". I use the orange one on the wrap & the yogurt sauce to douse the heat! Their Iskander kebab comes with pieces of flavorful gyro kind of meat on pita bread pieces doused with a yogurt sauce--another dish I can recommend.  And really I keep going back for just these two dishes. The service is friendly & the atmosphere, as in most ethnic restaurants, is casual.  Recommend it strongly!",

The waitstaff were very friendly from start to finish. Although prices are a bit on the higher end, their portions are very large, and were able to share the mix grill between two people. Before bringing out the entree, they gave us some fresh and warm pita bread, accompanied by two sauces. Both were very good--one was the usual yogurt, while the other was a less creamy, spicier type. When the main plate came out, we were surprised by how large it was. All four servings of meat were extremely flavorful; the adana kebab and gyro were probably my favorites, given how tender they were. Beneath all that was a plate of rice with spices that captured all the flavor remnants from the meat, as well as a modest salad on the side. This one plate of food left both of us stuffed and satisfied.",

I had the iskendar kebab which is essentially chunks of lamb smothered in a tomato sauce as well as yogurt with pieces of pita bread at the bottom. The pita soaks up the sauce and is excellent! Recommend adding the spicy sauce that is served on the side to give it that extra kick. I sampled the other dishes and they were quite good - chicken kebab platter and another must have the Adana kebab. Large portions for some things (in our case the Iskendar) although some dishes are easily consumed. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't a chicken gyro but either will be back! Of note, just be warned that it is quite tiny inside so not ideal for very large groups.",

My husband and I were wandering around Forbes and Murray earlier today and started looking for a place to grab a late lunch/early dinner. After checking out some reviews, we settled on the Turkish Kebab House.  Even at such an off time of day, there were 10-15 other patrons dining in the tiny restaurant when we arrived. Our waitress was a young woman who was both friendly and efficient. We started with the tabbouleh, which was absolutely delicious. The freshly baked, soft, perfectly browned pita paired nicely with this cold salad of parsley, mint, and onion. I really could have eaten about five servings of this tasty appetizer.  For my entree, I ordered the yogurt shish kabob while my husband ordered the classic chicken and lamb kabobs. I really appreciated that the waitress helped explain and guide us through the menu, making sure that we were receiving exactly what we had anticipated and providing her personal favorites. My yogurt dish was pita topped with mild tomato and yogurt sauces and chunks of lamb cooked to a perfect medium. My husband's dish was the classic lamb and chicken chunks paired with rice and salad which he topped with two tasty sauces delivered to the table, one mildly spicy in flavor and the other a classic tzatziki.   Don't let the exterior of this restaurant deter you because I can promise that the food will deliver. I am already looking forward to returning to this spot again in the future!",

At any rate, it was a pit however separated from the rest of the olive in the middle of cubed tomatoes and cucumbers. A tooth breaker for sure.  I also tried a Falafel wrap (first, luckily).

Chicken Adana has different flavor profile when compared to the kebab. They are definitely not spicy. Though, I am used to eating spicy food, that didn't matter because they have very juicy and tasty chicken. It didnot come across as a bland dish.   Coming to the desserts, the puddings they offer are the best. There are times when I go there just to pick up the pudding and treat myself. I don't even care to find out the calories I am gaining by eating that dessert.   I highly recommend this place if you are going out alone or with a bunch of friends and the pudding is something, that you should not miss trying.",

Their servers are also very friendly. Our server kept bringing us refills of the spicy sauce, which we were consuming a lot.  She insisted we try the baklawa for dessert. They top it with a dollop of sweet cream. Best baklawa ever!  They do not have a double door system, so every time someone enters or leaves (in the winter season), a gush of freezing air rushes in.

    "text": "Setting (+): It's small, but a lot nicer than your typical \"hole in the wall\" restaurants.   Service (+): Efficient and attentive staff! This place gets pretty packed during prime dinning hours so I respect that the staff cut straight to the chase.    Food (+): The hummus here is amazing. I'm usually really picky when it comes to hummus because I'm not a fan of \"lemony\" hummus. The hummus here is just right, not too much citrus and the perfect amount of flavors. The soft and fluffy pita bread is a plus too! For main plate, I ordered the lamb and rice. It was pretty much a deconstructed gyro on a plate with rice. The rice was so rich and buttery, which complimented the drier lamb and citrusy side salad. Overall, a great balance of flavors and textures.   Price/value (+): Not a cheap eat place, but prices aren't bad for the amount of food and quality.",

You spend like 20 dollars for some chicken, rice and lettuce. If I didn't feel like I was getting ripped off, I'd probably eat here every week. But instead it's like once every 8 months . I can get Indian food with tons of expensive spices in it for less than what I spend here and it's better tasting. So, I don't see why they charge so much.",

I wasn't expecting anything fancy but was hopeful based on the above suggestion. The decor is pretty casual and while not dirty, doesnt have the most pleasant ambience.  The service was a bit slow, but not unmanageable. The lamb dish I got was not as moist and flavorful as I have had elsewhere. Furthermore it was difficult to chew. The table pita was decent and the raita/yogurt sauce was good and added flavor to the dish.  Finally, the price was not any better than other places. All in all, based on the rave recommendation I was let down. It is fine though if you evaluate independently from that.",

    "text": "VERY disappointed.   I was super excited to come here because the reviews looked awesome. We came for dinner and were immediately seated. Our waitress comes over and literally doesn't even look at us, she is looking off into the distance asking us what we wanted. I asked if I could get the mixed chicken and lamb gyro and she responds with \"No chicken.\" Okay, thats fine...I get the lamb gyro instead. I don't think she said anything else to us. We get our food and I think it was just sitting in the back for awhile. The meat wasn't even that warm, lukewarm would probably be a good description for it. My boyfriend got the mix shish and adana kebab. He also said his food was kind of lukewarm in temperature.   Okay...I'm super hungry so I start eating and about halfway through I started to feel nauseous. Usually I have a stomach of steel, I swear, but this made me feel sick. I ate about half of it and couldn't finish because I felt sick. At this point, I also wanted a napkin but our waitress was nowhere to be found? I saw her put her jacket on and disappear for awhile so another girl came over. She was very sweet, as was the other waitress who came over and gave us a napkin.   We asked for boxes and the check, and I see that our original waitress is back and taking an order from another table. One of the nice waitresses came over and had to give us the boxes and checks. I felt bad because I wanted to tip well for the nice waitresses but since we weren't their table I wasn't sure if they would get the tip. Our original waitress never returned to our table, by the way.   I'm just very disappointed because I wanted to enjoy the food here and I did not want to get sick. I basically paid $27 to be ignored by our original waitress and have food that made me feel unwell. I gave them an extra star because at least my boyfriend didn't get sick and he somewhat enjoyed his lukewarm meal.",

This time - Mediterranean was the decision.  Ideally we order via Grubhub because delivery is the easiest.  Over a few days, after checking who delivered via Grubhub - and Turkish Kebab House was the winner - so i began getting everyones orders.  Then...the day I was getting ready to place the order - they were not delivering via grubhub.  That was a disappointment.    We worked it out that I went and picked up all the food - which while frustrating/inconvenient - it was a nice excuse to get out of the office briefly.  Everyone - the physicians, myself, etc were very happy with the food.  We had oodles of leftovers - but were happy to feed the nursing staff left on the floor.    Hopefully they work out their delivery issues and continue to delivery in the future.",

I just stare at the wall photos of Istanbul, Antalia, and Yalava I think. Brings back memories of my visit to that beautiful country. I tried the Shawerma during one visit and the Iskandar kabab on another. The kufte was really good but more on the harder well done side than I would normally like. Still very nice and blended well with the yogurt, and tomato sauce. I heard good things about the tender shish kabobs. Will try that next time. In the heart of Squirrel Hill, if you happen to be in the area and like Turkish or Levantine styles of grilling, give it a try. Friendly staff. Can be hit and miss if it's really busy but they try to keep on top of things.",

We got take out from there yesterday; it was great! It tasted so fresh. My husband and I each got a different type of wrap. My mixed gyro (chicken and lamb) was delicious. Meat, tomato, lettuce and a choice of two sauces; traditional (but, better) gyro sauce or a very hot and different hot sauce. My husband opted for the chicken kabob wrap; it was gone before I could ask to try it so it must have been great. Lastly, we got the cigarettes (I think that's what they called them). They are small thin rolls with cheese in the middle; served hot. WOW.  Very impressed and eager to go back. Perhaps try dining there instead of taking out.",

Very bare bones decor inside, which is one reason why it's a very popular take-out spot. Not a good pick of you want a trendy or romantic night out. Quick, no frills service.  I love their vegetarian options. We split a sampler platter for $15 and it had a great variety of salads, grape leaves, and tzatziki yogurt. All tasty and a heavy appetizer to split for two people. We also tried their hummus and baba ganoush. The former was pretty standard (I've had better) but the latter had great flavor. The falafel platter had a side salad, hummus, and four large falafel patties deep fried to a nice crisp. Good meal size.  One person in our party got a meat dish, the ground beef patties with spices (Grilled Kofte I think). The meat was tender and flavorful, the salad a bit boring. Large meal size unless you have a big appetite.",

I have had most of the cold appetizers and all of the types of kebobs on the menu. It is fresh, well-cooked food.    However, the service is not. I went in to get some cold appetizers and pitas to go for snacks later since I was on Forbes already. I had never done this before but I thought why not. When I was given a total it was a couple of dollars more than I expected and I asked why (since I literally order this same stuff weekly through GrubHub so I know the price). She showed me the receipt and they were charging $.90 for each pita in store. I asked (politely) why that was because they are $.50 using GrubHub (and free if you are sitting there eating). The response: \"That is what is in the system. I don't change the system. If it is different online that is not my problem. Do you want them or not?\" Well, that was just downright rude. I paid the price and while I waited for my takeout I checked to make sure I was not mistaken about the price differences online. I was correct. Across all platforms (GrubHub, yelp, MenuPages, eat street, ect.) the extra pita is $.50. When they gave me my food I mentioned that and I got a slightly reworded, again rude, response like the one above.   Here is the deal. It is not that they are inconsistent in pricing (which does make me irritated) or even that my order was a couple of dollars more ... it was the unwillingness to correct it and the RUDE response. It was inappropriate. Good businesses do not do that.   I spend a ton of money here (literally one of my fav places in Pittsburgh and I eat here a lot) and tell all of my friends to try it. NOW I will never go back or suggest it because of the rude service.",

Since the reviews were brilliant and Mediterranean food rarely disappoints, we did not mind the 30 minute drive to get the food.  Ordered through GrubHub and went to pick up the food which was ready on time! The location seems to be very prime (am not a local, and it was late night so it's just my guess) and buzzing with people. When I went to pick up the food, the food was handed over a counter, behind which seemed like a partial open kitchen and the kababs were nicely marinated and skewered on, ready to grilled for next orders. I could say that the kababs were going to be tasty just by looking at the marination (I was actually drooling from inside :) )  Ok, now to the point, the kababs all of them (lamb shish, chicken, adana and falafel) were perfectly grilled, superbly seasoned and came with a generous portion of some aromatic rice and lettucy salad and a couple of sauces. If ever am back in town I'll surely not leave without having their kababs, so that pretty much sums up my experience with Turkish Kabab House.  Oh, and by the way the owner was pretty accommodative, in sorting out a issue that I had with GrubHub, really appreciate that.",

When you come in you sit wherever and they come to you. They also do takeout i believe. You get a ton for your money too! I typically eat half and take the rest home. This is my favorite place to eat in Squirrel Hill, it's a go to for families of all ages. They have an upper level for parties i believe, i'm unsure if you can typically eat there too. I love how authentic it is being family owned. overall please give it a try you will not be disappointed.",

However, we noticed there were empty tables outside, and they let us claim a table on the sidewalk right away.   The disappointing part of our experience was the service. No one gave us menus for at least 15 minutes, our water was not refilled, and when we asked our server a few questions about the menu, he was unable to answer them. Maybe service would have been better if we had waited for a seat inside  We ended up getting the baba ganoush as an appetizer, and I had the falafel wrap. Both were delicious! My dining partner also tried the Aryan yogurt drink. I was pretty skeptical but it was actually quite refreshing and served in a lovey copper pitcher, though beware it is pretty tart  Would have been 5 stars with better service",

I walked in and the layout was slightly confusing because it was filled with tables and nobody really greets you. I went to the back and a waitress sat me down and gave me a menu.   There weren't tons of vegetarian entrees but they had a lot of appetizers. I ended up getting a few of those. In ordered the shepherd salad which is basically chopped cucumbers, tomatoes and onions. I ordered the cigarette borek which was a cigar shaped pastry shell filled with cheese and spinach. Finally, I ordered the falafel platter. It was really good! The borek and falafel were both deep fried but the salads made me feel healthy!   Now for the best part.. the baklava!!! Hands down the best I have EVER had. A bit crunchy, chewy, sweet but not overly sweet and not too sticky.. and the nuts! My goodness it was perfect. They serve you four of them with whipped cream and chocolate. Incredible!   I will be back again, however, it will not be a place I frequent due to the lack of vegetarian dinner options.",

I've had falafel at Daphne Grill and it is not even close to being as savory and delicious as Turkish Kebab house.  Another favorite of mine is the shepherds salad. This is cucumbers onions and tomatoes in a delicious vinegrette that they make there. It's so incredibly fresh and delicious.  Finally, their baklava is homemade & it tastes so delicious pastry flaky and it's not too sweet. I hate places that make baklava that tastes like they poured white sugar into the honey, mixed it, then drowned the baklava in this. This dessert is tastefully done, and is so delicious.  Their drink: Turkish tea is also very warming and tasty. The service is also fantastic - I've always had this one woman, and she is very friendly and gives great service. The interior of the restaurant is clean and beautiful at Shadyside.  Highly recommend people visit the Shadyside location!",

Someone very close to me took me to this place and I have found very few middle eastern restaurants that I have loved as much as this place.

It's located in squirrel hill so there is plenty of opportunity for a casual stroll after dinner/lunch here.   This is my absolute favorite casual middle eastern place and is tied with Alihans as my fav overall middle eastern restaurant.",

    "text": "This order is a bit late (from around Thanksgiving week). I ordered through Yelp for pick-up, and made an error. I thought I had set the order for pick-up in 2 hours, but upon order confirmation I realized it was not a delayed order. I called the restaurant within 3 minutes of making the order, and asked if they could hold off on preparing my order and have it ready for 9pm (it was around 7pm). There was a bit of confusion at first, but they agreed.  I arrived at 9pm, and my food was hot and ready to go! I ordered yogurt chicken kebab and baklava.  For the kebab, I was expecting chicken on skewers served with rice, etc... When I arrived home, I was surprised to see I got something completely different than expected, but I was tired after a long day so I decided to just eat it... What a mistake, because it tasted horrible. I didn't make it more than 3 bites. The dish was chicken in some kind of tomato sauce, and there appeared to be EXTREMELY soggy pita at the bottom. I couldn't figure out what the soggy thing was at first, but the texture almost made me sick.  The baklava tasted good, until I got something in it that was inedible. There was an object in the baklava that was white, and very hard -- it almost looked like a ceramic fork tine (honestly, my first thought was an animal tooth of some kind - but that doesn't make sense).  I ended up calling the shop and started by saying I thought I got the wrong order. The lady pulled up my order and told me that it was correct. I told her I was expecting chicken on a stick, not a tomato sauce dish, but she told me I didn't know what I was talking about -- that's what kebab is! I also told her the food was soggy and tasted like it had been sitting for a long time, and she blamed the fact that I took two hours to pick it up... Even though I had called with 3 minutes and they had agreed to make it for a later pick-up.  Honestly, I didn't feel like fighting her. I simply told her that I was very unhappy with the food I received, and she didn't bother offering any kind of remedy. I let it go, but I will NEVER be back, and I cannot believe how disappointed I am in this experience. No thank you!",

The Shish kabobs were chewy and extremely dry. Safe to say, I won't be going back here any time soon.",

We ordered the eggplant salad, stuffed grape leaves, lebne and falafel plate for appetizers. These came with flat bread and were very tasty and nicely presented. For mains, we all shared yogurt chicken kebab, shish kebab and chicken kebab, which were absolutely delicious; the shish kebab is definitely the best I have ever tasted, and I don't like lamb all that much, but this meat was out of this world! The main dishes come with a nice size salad and yummy rice, the plates are big, you get a lot of food, the prices are super reasonable for all that you get. We weren't able to finish all the food, so we had leftovers to take home. We were so stuffed that unfortunately we didn't have any room to try the desserts, but that's a must for our next visit. We will definitely come back and would recommend to anyone. They have varied options for both meat lovers and vegetarians.",

The lebne appetizer is especially noteworthy. I've had it other places but not like they make it. They put walnuts, dill, and lemon ; it's the best I've had anywhere",

Twice they called me up to pickup my order only to tell me it wasnt ready when I got to the counter.  To their credit, the spices in Adana kepab were spot on but it was way too dry. The sauces came on the side which turned quite messy as I had to disassemble and reassemble the wrap. The cigara borek was chewy and the cheese mixture did not taste correct. It wasnt a bad flavor mind you, it just wasnt the right flavor. The second visit, I dined in with a friend and it was more of the same. No kofte so we got Adana wraps. The dine in service was terrible. After dropping off our wraps, the waitress basically disappeared. After a very long wait she finally came back out and asked if we needed anything else, and I asked for our checks. She disappeared again for 20 minutes at which point I went to the counter and asked a cook to get her.  I've tried several times since to give the place a try, every single time I do they do not have kofte, regardless of time or day of week. I find this completely unacceptable, if you dont want to serve it, take it off the menu.   I'm done with the place. This really would have been a several meals a week location for me but the complete ineptitude of the staff is too much to ignore. Don't waste your money on this place.",

However everything else was lacking. When I order and salad is brought out I expect the salad to be at least green. It was a brown salad that came out of a bag. I expect that from my house but not going out for dinner. However the dressing was good I am disappointed in its appearance and that's it's pre prepped salad. It came with the standard green pepper, but turned out not to be so standard. The picture and my experience tells me the peppers are supposed to be long and sweet, however this restaurant decided to go against its picture and give me a small pepper that was to hot. The rice pilaf was fine tasting, and the grape leaf wraps were fine however it was not enough to save this meal.",
