I've been there twice already and will go back before I leave in a few days.  I sat at the bar during both of my visits, and the bartenders were both very nice...Bob during the day and Paul at night.  The pumpkin beer and milk stout are both awesome.  Like other reviewers stated, the nachos are great!  I think the best part was that everyone was very friendly.  Other customers seated at the bar were eager to chat, which is so nice when you don't know anyone in the area!  Great place!  Thanks for the hospitality!",

The hubster and I were here on a Saturday evening after a show at the Improv so we were happy and in a good mood and ready to enjoy some good eats.  We ordered drinks.  He a wheat beer of their brewing, me my fave Bloody Mary with Absolut Peppar.  The hubster deemed the beer acceptable, but wouldn't go out of his way to come back just for another one....yes, he DID order another one \"just to be sure.\"  My Bloody sucked.  Watered down tomato juice with no discernible Peppar of any kind, let alone any other seasonings.  Even a good standard mix would have been better.  Our very efficient and friendly waitress took it back and watched while it was remade by the other bartender.  Nope, no better at all.  That went back and I went with a you-can't-screw-it-up Amaretto sour.  It was fine.  Hub ordered a Reuben - why, I'll never know because they simply never measure up to the gold standard of what used to be at the long-lamented Gazebo in Shadyside.  You younguns wouldn't have a clue of the establishment of which I speak.  He said this one was \"fine.\"  I had the Texas Fire steak with jalapeno butter which I enjoyed very much!  Packed a punch of heat and flavor, but the sides were uninspired.  Steamed veggies.  Any flavor was steamed out in the process - eh.  Cheddar mashed potatoes - there was cheddar in there?????  No way!  The tab was reasonable - we DID have a Living Social deal that took $30 off, so our check was for $12 and change, not including tip.  Not bad (even with the $15 cost of the LS Deal), but had we paid full price, it wouldn't have been worth the experience.  We'll hit the Improv again - we have before - but, we'll head somewhere else afterwards.",

Today we got the guac sampler and the fish tacos.  We were undecided on a couple of brews, and the bartender comped us some generous samples.  The guac sampler (spicy pepper, mango, and pineapple) came with housemade chips which were a standout (not too oily, just the right amount of crispness), and the fish tacos were tasty but ordinary.  We've also enjoyed the cheese and pretzel app.  But the 4 stars are definitely for the beers.  RB has a great selection of affordable beers in a variety of styles.  Little-known fact--they actually offer a beer sampler where you can try the 10-12 brews they have, and it's something like $7 for 3-4 ounce pours of each. It's not on the menu, but the servers told us about it on our first and second visits. BEST DEAL EVER. Even if you only like half of them, you're way ahead of most bars on the price per ounce.  (The only better deal is when the bartender comps you the samples).  Good food, great beer, great service--a fabulous way to do dinner & a movie!",

It seems there are so many breweries out there that offer great beer, and slack off on the food. Unfortunately Rock Bottom is one that falls into that category. Let's be honest, when you go to a brewery, you want the full experience. If it was only about the beer, I'd go buy a growler and take it home.   So, about the beer....EXCELLENT!!!!! The Jagoff IPA is with out a doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had! They only I can think of that I think is better is Dogfish Head, but that's a matter of opinion. The beer selection is constantly changing, and they always have some excellent seasonal beers. You can't go wrong, there's bound to be a beer everyone will like.   As for the food.......it's pretty much a crap shoot. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's terrible. My biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food. One time it's perfect, then maybe it's cold, or it's burned, or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it. Unfortunately, it seems there is zero attention to food quality.   That's pretty much it. This place fixes it's food consistency, and it's a five star place. Till then, it's hit or miss!",

This was our second attempt at trying Rock Bottom on Fathers Day. The first time almost ten years ago. We went in the early afternoon and they had already ran out of steaks. How do you do that on Fathers Day?! This time we went around 12 noon and beat the rush.  My wife got and loved the Berry Bash Sangria. She just said it had too much ice in it. Our daughter got the root beer float which she love and I started with a Mango Ice Tea, but later switched for a raspberry ice tea as the mango ice tea wasn't sweet enough.  We started off the the Kobe beef sliders as our app. It took at least 15 minutes to get them. You get three sliders and they were very good.  My wife got a small greenhouse salad with Jalapeno ranch dressing to start off with which she enjoyed and the lobster & shrimp enchiladas as her main entree. She complained about how salty it was and the fact that there was no lobster in it at all.  Our daughter got the kids burger and fries. No surprise there.  I ordered the New York Strip with mashed potatoes and it came with green bean as well. My strip was cooked perfectly and has a decent taste. Longhorn has a much, much better quality of steak though. The green beans were pretty good and my mashed potatoes very bland and pretty average.   The kitchen sounded like an live episode of Hell's Kitchen. The waiters were repeatedly asking for orders at least 5 to 6 times. The kitchen was backed up the whole time we were there.  On a different note, our waitress Susan was very good. Come here for drinks and the bar food. Skip everything else.",

As always it is a haircut weekend so the twin carnivores, the mother in law and I decided to tie the feed bag on at RB. Our server Matt was easy to work with and informative.   I started off with the tortilla soup. Spicy and thick it went down easy enough. However let me say that the price at $3.50 was rather steep for the serving size. Did somebody say OUCH!! Thing one and thing two each had the 'small fry steaks'  with fruit (cantaloupe, melons, and grapes) and steamed broccoli and at $6.75 each, I think I was 'buffaloed' IF  you get my drift. The steak consisted of three small thinly sliced pieces of .... Hmmm.   They say that kids say the darnedest things well thing one noticed that his steak was very very gristly, and thing two noticed that his was rather dry. Not the best dinner they have eaten. They say you get what you pay for OR NOT!!    My meal consisted of the Chicken Bacon Mac & Cheese  and at $14.75 I had no complaints. It was filing hot and load with chicken and bacon. How can anything be wrong with that much BACON!!!   The final dinner consisted of chicken fried chicken and at $13.95 my mother in law was sated. Over all this meal was a wash. If anyone from Rock Bottom corporate reads this... You may seriously want to rethink you portion sizes.   As you know I vote with my feet and dollars, and neither will be there again ANY time soon!!",

We ordered guacamole for the appetizer and that took long enough, within less than 10 minutes of receiving our appetizer , our food came out and didn't even have time to finish the guacamole. We barely seen our waiter to even get a refill! We finish eating and of course waiting to find our waiter when another girl comes over and starts to clean up our dishes while we were still waiting to find our waiter! She knocked over the half glass of tea all over the table, ALL OVER MYSELF , down my shirt and pants AND MY PHONE!!! She was extremely apologetic tossed a few small napkins at me and took the dishes while leaving the ice all over the table, never came back to finish cleaning up the mess... So sitting at the table that is covered in water, tea, melting ice cubes, wet napkins, still looking for our waiter to bring us the check. Took another good 10-15 to get our check, pay and leave.",

It started off with the dual hostesses pointing our 6 top group to a booth in front of the door on a freezing night but the table across the aisle had 6-8 coats hanging on the hooks for our booth and we couldn't get in. We asked for another table and were treated like idiots for even asking such a stupid question. After openly scoffing and scowling at us we got another table. Right next to a group of a dozen 7-8 year olds who had no adult supervision and ran around screaming and throwing shit around the room. We actually pulled our tables back from them to give them more running room. After all this crap the food came out and was  - meh..... Our server was great to us and embarrassed for the restaurant itself... Stay away from this place...there a ton of better places in the Waterfront",

The beer there is great, it's a fairly clean establishment with a good wait staff, but the food IS AWFUL. I ordered the quesadilla appetizer, and for $10.59 I got 4 mini tortillas, not toasted at all, with some melted cheese and chicken. No salsa, no lettuce, guac, sour cream.  NOTHING.   Then I was hoping the pizza I ordered would sort of redeem our experience, I got their \"hot\" style pizza since I like spicy food. The small pizza probably had 8 jalapenos worth of peppers, and then some sauce and cheese. It was so underwhelming. I wish the food could match the quality of their beer. Real bummer.",

    "text": "Absolutely horrid and dangerous. Don't ever come here if you value your safety because the service staff do not give three shits to the wind about you.   The service was extremely slow on a night with hardly any customers. Our waiter brought us our food ice cold and only to come back and say it was for another table. He then proceeded to take our food and give it to this other table after we had touched it and tried it. If I was sick then whoever  was at this other table could've gotten ill. I'm afraid to think about how many other customers this might've happened to and will happen to in the future.   He brought out a new order of the food and it was ice cold again. I am not one to complain about things. I hate complaining. But this seriously was the worst, coldest plate of nachos I have ever had the displeasure of tasting. I told the server to take the plate back and just get rid of it. To dispose of that abhorred insult to nachos everywhere by any means necessary. He then had the gall to question whether it was cold after I had literally just tried the frigid chips. In a world where \"the customer is always right\" I couldn't believe it.   I'm usually one to give the benefit of the doubt to restaurants. Sometimes people are having a bad day. That's okay, but usually the food will shine through. It's been so long since I've visited a place where both are absolutely shitty at best. I will reiterate. Don't come here. Or at least, don't come here for the food. It's not worth it when there are plenty of other decent business around that actually care about your safety. If you need a drink, at the least their booze can help you drown out the depressing service.",

It wasn't the best burger I had ever had, but it certainly wasn't the worst.  It satisfied the craving I had and that was really all I expected.  The reason I'm giving this place a four star is the beer.  I had the High-Level IPA and it was fantastic.  Rock Bottom is know for its beer and they did not disappoint.  Everyone in our group that had beer was impressed.  Don't go to Rock Bottom necessarily expecting the best food you've ever had and you won't be disappointed with the experience.  What you can do though is go expecting some pretty damn good beer.  Do that and you won't be disappointed.",

House brewed beers were below average. The wit bier tasted like a flat, less flavorful Blue Moon - and considering Blue Moon is not anything special, that is saying something. Beers took at least 10 mins to come to the table after ordering. Food was served ICE cold and was completely tasteless. The sandwich I got was mushy. I didn't eat 3/4 of my plate and noted that most others in the 8 person party I was with didn't either. Everyone said the food was sub-par. Would never return here.",

It was a short hike from the theater, but I am not cold tolerant, and was glad of the warm, comfortable restaurant interior.  It was pretty empty (my favorite), and we were ushered to a booth, which was roomy and comfortable.    Our server was friendly, attentive, and made great recommendations.  The beers were very tasty!  Even though we were starving, our server recommended getting 1/2 order of nachos if we planned to get dinner.  GOOD TIP!!!  The half order of nachos is piled on to a traditional dinner plate, and it was plenty of appetizer for 2 people.  My friend got the country fried chicken with mashed potatoes and slaw.  She seemed to enjoy it.  I got the veggie pizza with feta, which was good, but I think I would have been happier with something else.  There was no fatal flaw in the pizza, I think I was stuck eating bread with grilled veggies and feta while my friend ate fried chicken- and that was entirely my fault.   Overall, this was a positive experience.  It has a \"chain\" feel (because it is a chain), but I would go back and recommend it to others.  It is for foodies? Nope.  It is amazingly original?  Nope.  But it is good food, good beer, good service, and a fair price.  Definitely.",

There were a lot of great choices on the menu. I chose the grilled chicken sandwich which had barbecue sauce, bacon, cheddar cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, and red onions. The chicken it self had a great grilled flavor. I think it was good enough to eat plain. The barbecue sauce was smokey with a hint of sweetness. The pickles added a tangyness. It was a huge sandwich. It was served with fries but they were a little soft. They needed a few more minutes of cooking.  I only ate half of my sandwich so I would have room for dessert. They have a couple of smaller desserts that are served in Mason jars. Then they have a few that are larger that you could share with 2pr 3 people. I ordered the cheesecake with caramel and toffee. Yum!!!! It was the perfect ending to a good meal.",

    "text": "I haven't been to Rock Bottom in years.  Maybe even decades...is that even possible?  Well, either way, it's been awhile.  So with my gift certificate I took my brother out for a birthday dinner.    As I get older, my tolerance for things like crowds and youngsters gets lower and lower.  As a result, I told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the Waterfront before everyone goes out for date night.  Plus the Pirates were playing at 4:05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game.  When we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table.  Our server was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  Right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers.  We loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, \"I have to go back for the rest.\"  In all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - I can never tell).  I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer.  I liked more than I didn't, and very few were not to my liking.  So the $6.95 10 beer sampler was well worth it.    During our sampling we indulged on some Southwest Egg Rolls.  They were okay, but not quite what I expected.  The spicy ranch was top notch, though.  As we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a Kobe Burger.  They were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium).  And to top off our wonderful evening, the Pirates brought home a win!  My only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler.  The glass container itself is sold for $12.95.  That's the empty price.  To me, that's a little ridiculous when East End only charges $3 for the bottle and Penn Brewery $5.  Paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me.  So I walked out empty handed.    But it won't deter me from returning.",

    "text": "Ergh, this place. I hate giving bad reviews but on my latest visit, I should have listened to my gut and not repeated my visit here. Naturally, I'm not a stranger to this chain, understand it's a chain, but the past visit here was just not good.  Came with my brother on a Sunday after a driving lesson. We were hungry and this was his way of paying for gas money. We were seated in the dining area. Every time we are seated in the dining area it's a bad experience. On the bar side you get entertainment, the beer flights/draft specials are decent and the bar food/appetizers are passable.  It started off with the soft drinks. I'm not a pop drinkers so when I want a simple diet pepsi I expect it not to taste funky [and yes, I prefer the weird twang of diet drinks to sugar in a glass taste of regular]. There was incorrect carbonation, whether they were running out [I suspect this], no ice [lukewarm] or they had just hooked up a new box [unlikely]. I sent it back.  My brother got a burger which he said was fine, it came with an egg on it and he found himself satisfied. I tried to steal a few of his fries, which were a failure. They tasted like the off brand in the freezer section [a full mouth of starch], and were barely crispy enough. So abandon plan. On my own dish I had the classic mac n' chicken. First of all, the pasta was crispy?, really?, it wasn't a cheese sauce, it was pretty much butter baked on and sprinkled in Parmesan and smothered in breadcrumbs. And when I say smothered here, this is not a good thing. Sigh. The chicken was pushed to the bottom of the pan, which my brother tasted because I was turned off my this version of my favorite dish, and said it was cooked properly. A small save?   Again - I sent it back after about 3 bites. The waitress came back asking if I wanted a box, I told her to take it away. She did and disappeared into oblivion until we had to flag her down for the check, which I didn't see as my brother paid for it while I used the restroom, I hope they didn't charge us for the pop drink.... Needless to say, I came home hungry.   Honestly, if you come, come for drinks and a salad, they don't screw those up. Everything else, avoid.",

    "text": "So after an evening of enjoying a comedy show at the Waterfront, we headed to Rock Bottom for some late night grub.  The place was pretty busy, we had to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple told us they were about to leave and we could have their bar table.  As nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left.    So finally seated I look over the drinks and being the huge IPA lover that I am I went with that and it was indeed a good choice.  The hubby had the Red Ale which was also rather good.  The service was OK, not the best not the worst.  But moving on to more important thing, the food.  Talk about missing the mark hugely!  I ordered the mini street fish tacos.  You get four mini tacos with a marinated in lime piece of fish, and tomatillo salsa.  They were just strokes away from inedible.  I love fish tacos, I mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? The shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when I picked them up.  The sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked.  If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten them at all! Lesson learn on that.  The husband had the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  It had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream.  My husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizza's and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings!  For instance, he would usually just say, Chicken BBQ and cheese, nothing else!  I refused to let him do that this time, because I was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie.  And boy was I jealous when it came out.  It blew my crappy tacos out of the water!  Should have stuck with something simple.    Furthermore I could care less if I come back to this location.  The beers were good but hell you can get a decent IPA just about anywhere anymore.  And the underwhelming food sealed the deal.  I know this is a chain, but it still doesn't have to stink...",

Down side is limited menu selection and NO Coronas.  Besides that so far I'd recommend this establishment.  Ordered the 2 am burger with cheese, bacon and egg.  Yes i said egg.  The egg was suppose to be cooked over easy but it was totally cooked finished so having the experience of having yoke run down the side of the burger was gone.  Besides that the burger and fries taste good.  If your unfamiliar with area and need a cool place to go, try Rock Bottom.",

Their Happy Hour is the best value in town with discounts on beer and appetizers.  They have several beers in their regular lineup and constantly vary another half dozen or so.  All are brewed on site.  Try the Jalapeno Pretzel Sticks. They are made with jalapenos in the dough, stuffed with cheese and served with jalapeno spinach dip. Their nachos are served on a huge platter that is more then enough for two. And make sure that you sign up for their loyalty club. It rewards you with discounts and special promotions that make a good value even better. Did I mention that the wait staff in the bar area is their most experienced, longest tenured so you generally get the best service there.",

Sounds like a good time, but be careful or you'll end up on the rock bottom.  After a 30 minute wait staring at half of an empty restaurant with the usual goofy decor you would find at a Buffalo Wild Wings, we were finally seated. We could feel the tension from other diners that something wasn't right. The manger was running around apologetically and the food was casually sunbathing under the heat lamps. We immediately ordered a few apps but just like GOT, and now our watch begins.  We waited and waited to finally receive the saddest, tiniest plates of food with bloated chain restaurant prices. The food was uninspired, tired, and ordinary. The only reason why I am giving them 2 stars is because of the extremely gracious and apologetic wait staff who took off 20% of our meal due to the terrible service.   So if you have decided to take a seat at Rock Bottom, take comfort in knowing that even the staff seems to know your pain.",

The bun had the most flavor which is a sad statement.  It was topped with an olive and a mini pickle... odd.  My \"squash\" side was lacking squash. Instead all squash was replaced by peppers... which I cannot eat.  Our server was nice.  The beer was simple.

    "text": "It's been a couple years since I first reviewed Rock Bottom, and while I still don't love the place they've definitely improved since then. They admittedly still aren't my first choice food-wise because, by design, they're a pretty generic eatery for the most part, especially compared to other options in the area. Their local brews are really the only thing that sets them apart from other places in the Waterfront, and Pittsburgh has so many breweries and so forth now that even that isn't the biggest draw anymore.  That said, their brews ARE usually quite good and worth trying. Plus, they ARE improving in terms of service and quality of food, and that deserves a mention. Sure, I may think their menu of burgers, pizzas and American eats is pretty average, but I also think the quality of the dishes is improving. For example, my burgers are no longer coming to me overcooked, and as a result actually taste like a burger and not like a pile of toppings and a dry meat patty. Some dishes are even more memorable now; I actually really like their veggie burger, which is packed full of flavor that even I, a known carnivore, can appreciate. And their fresh pretzels and dip? Absolutely amazing - exactly what you'd expect from a warm pretzel fresh out of the oven.   I was especially impressed during my last visit by a server named Mark, who was incredibly attentive and came to our table regularly to check on drinks and keep us updated. He never said a negative word and was quick to correct any mistakes or problems that popped up during the night. If Rock Bottom hires more people like him, there will be many more happy people coming and going from the place, I guarantee it.  Add in the fact that this is one of a small handful of places that accepts reservations in the Waterfront - a MAJOR plus when planning big outings with friends in the area! - and you have a reliable place where a group of people can go after a movie, shopping, etc. for food and drinks. And for that, Rock Bottom's earned another star in my book.",

    "text": "NO LONGER THE SAME RESTAURANT.   I can't begin to say how disappointed and, frankly, angry I am with the Rock Bottom Brewery in Homestead. We came to love the Rock Bottom chain in Chicago for their energetic and well-trained staff, high-quality craft beers, and excellent food. Not haute cuisine, of course, but some very tasty and inventive recipes across a solid range of American, Italian and Tex-Mex varieties -- consistently good, regardless of which franchise we happened to be eating at. So it was with real delight that we discovered a Rock Bottom in Pittsburgh when we moved here several years ago. Same quality staff, same quality beers, same quality food, and all in a perfect location at the Homestead Waterfront. We began frequenting this establishment on a regular basis, at least once a month.   But that all changed in 2016, with the hiring of a new manager and the radical turnover of waitstaff - and I would assume kitchen staff. While they carry the same menu, this store is definitely NOT following the same recipes, not training their staff in the same way, and not maintaining the same quality of craft brewing. The wait staff are dull and bored, the food is dull and boring and is NOT prepared according to the recipes listed on the menu, while only the beer remains relatively passable. In short, this restaurant was taken over by someone with zero commitment to maintaining the same standards of quality food, training, and organization represented by the rest of the chain, and seems hellbent on reducing the store to the same level of mediocrity found throughout the Pittsburgh region. This restaurant was GREAT, but they are killing it. If you're at the Waterfront, don't waste your time going there. Longhorn Steakhouse and PF Changs are vastly superior options.",

    "text": "Tom and I decided to try this place out before catching a late movie on a Saturday night. He is a beer buff, and neither of us had ever been there, so we gave it a go.  We walked in around 8pm and we were told that there would be an hour long wait. We put our names on the list and went shopping around the area. About 25 minutes later, our table was ready. Parking was a cluster since the lot is shared with Dave & Busters and a karaoke bar called Sing Sing. Tom dropped me off at the door so I could secure our table.  Our server, Jackie, approached me almost immediately and brought two waters to the table to start. She was very attentive and funny, and probably the best part of our experience at the restaurant. Tom ordered a Red Ale and to his surprise, didn't care for it. Jackie gave Tom three free samples of beers she thought he would like after talking to him about his beer drinking habits. He loved all three, and chose the most bizarre (and expensive) beer. Jackie switched the Red Ale to the beer of Tom's choice, and charged us for the less expensive beer. Very nice of her!  We started out with the Ball Park Pretzels with Jalapeno dip. The pretzels came out quickly and they were very fresh, not to mention huge! We only ate one and took the other to go. Very good app though!   Tom ordered some sort of bacon cheeseburger, and I got the Chicken Fried Chicken, which was a pounded chicken breast, breaded and fried, over white cheddar mashed potatoes with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw.  Tom's burger came with a small handful of fries, and my meal was very spread out on my plate, like something was missing. Not very good presentation at all. The food itself was okay, nothing to write home about. The potatoes were my favorite part. Tom said that his burger was mediocre.  Another note: The bathrooms are shared with the Sing Sing karaoke bar that is in the same building, so expect drunk singing women in the bathrooms and brides-to-be puking in the stall next to you after enjoying too much alcohol at their bachelorette party... Yuck.  Overall, we might come back for the beer and service, but not for the food. And DEFINITELY not to use the bathroom...",

    "text": "Rock Bottom is a chain brew pub one that, in my opinion, is just \"OK\".  The restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table. They have many of their own brews that you can sample but to tell you the truth none of them are that good. I have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable.   Their food is pretty much like their beers, forgettable. I have had one of their burgers and their pizza and they really weren't anything to write home about.  I feel they will impress those who have never been to a brew pub but I would probably describe them as the Chili's of Brew Pubs. If you are in homestead and are looking for a burger and a beer it might be a good choice for a bite, or at least until the Burgatory opens!",

    "text": "Average is the word to describe Rock Bottom brewery. Service is good, staff is friendly, but the food is mediocre at best.   Our most recent visit to Rock Bottom brewery was on a Tuesday night. The restaurant was not very busy. We were seated immediately and waited on immediately.   My husband ordered a $4 flight of drinks on special. He enjoyed each one, especially the Wintercrush, which was suggested by the server. I really liked the Irish Pearl, which is a dark dry Irish stout. It had notes of smoke, wood, and coffee, which I really enjoyed.   For my meal I ordered the ribeye, medium. It was cooked slightly medium-well around the edges of the steak. There was very basic seasoning on it, so it was just a steak. Nothing special, no seasoning that stood out. I added shrimp to my steak for $3.99. The shrimp were a severe disappointment. They were extra small shrimp, and they lacked any seasoning. They were also overcooked, so they were curled up into tight little balls.   As for my sides I ordered the green beans (seasonal vegetable), and the apple coleslaw. The green beans were also bland. No seasoning on them at all. They could have used a little garlic or onion or something. The Apple slaw was average as well - it was a standard mayo based slaw, with a few pieces of Apple here and there. I feel like more vinegar would have brightened it up and allowed the Apple to come through more in the dish. If I had to give this meal a letter grade, I would give it a C.   My husband ordered the fish and chips, with a side of Apple slaw. The fish was tasty, moist and cooked well. The Cajun remoulade was really good, and added a nice touch to the meal. The fries (chips) were standard fries seasoned with a Cajun season salt. I'd say his meal was better because it was better seasoned.   All in all we had a good experience, but the food wasn't anything to get excited over. I would probably return for the pub-food and drink specials, but wouldn't come back if I were in the mood for steak.",

The Gentleman was good in my opinion.  2 out of 8 beers impressed me and above standard for my tastes while the others were below standard when it comes to craft beers.  Again this is my opinion. I have a wide range of styles I enjoy but IPAs are a solid choice for me.  Pricing for flights was excellent at $6 for 6 4oz. tasters.  The service was lackluster. Myself and two friends were sat and the waitress took my order and the other man but ignored the girl that was with us and walked off without even asking her if she would like anything. She was a bit put off to say the least. We tracked the waitress down and she apologized but the rest of the stay was a bit awkward.    I hear the food is very good and will return to try it and adjust my review accordingly.",

They were very crowded, but we got a reservation on OpenTable and were able to skip the line.  We arrived a few minutes early, but they were able to seat us when we got there.    The beer is consistently good here--  I went with the fire chief red ale, and my husband tried both one of the cask strength beers and an IPA.  I ordered the bacon chicken mac n' cheese, and it was as good as I remembered.  My husband's steak was overdone, but the servers were very apologetic (they offered to replace it, and ended up comping it) and he said it was seasoned well.  For dessert, we split the mason jar bourbon pecan pie, and it was delicious, with a really delicious ice cream on top.  This location may not have quite lived up to our expectations from the original, but I'd be happy to end up here again if I'm in the area.",

Rock Bottom brews some of their own beers with a nice variety of ambers, reds, and IPAs.  Typically when I'm here I like to sit at the bar or in one of the high tops near the bar where you can seat yourself.  If weather permits they also have a nice sized patio where you can also dine. Usually I'm here to share appetizers and my go to is the ballpark soft pretzels with the cheese dip.  They also serve some pretty good nachos.  When ordering from the menu I've found the grilled chicken BBQ sandwich to be a HUGE HIT.  This is one delicious sandwich.

Oh, well.  Can't speak about beer here as I'm not a beer drinker.  The space is pleasant and our server was efficient even if the meal wasn't the quickest to come to our table even though it wasn't busy.  Would I revisit?

The one chain that I can't break from is rock bottom.   Their beer is always good- as far as their staples go, I really love their white ale. Their seasonal IPAs have been good and my favorite seasonals of all time included their chocolate raspberry stout (...yes, it tasted as good as it sounds; they had it last year around Christmas) and their smoky BBQ brown ale (tasted like summer, complemented BBQ amazingly ; they had it this past summer, I bought a growler of it lol).   As far as their food goes, I typically stay away from the appetizers. $10 and up is a little too pricey for me as far as appetizers go. I've had their southwestern rolls and they were good but not worth $10.   Almost every time I go I order the Baja chicken sandwich. It's my favorite chicken sandwich! So good. The chicken is actually grilled (which goes for all of their chicken sandwiches) and I love the charred flavor that it has. The bun is soft but sturdy and doesn't fall apart while eating the sandwich, the sauce is amazing, the onion frizzles are the best and last but not least... There's a half of a fresh avocado on this sandwich. Mhm! I love it. My boyfriend usually gets the hickory BBQ bacon chicken sandwich and loves it as well.   Another item I ALWAYS get... Their apple coleslaw. I've yet to find better coleslaw in a restaurant. So simple, yet oh so good.   They also recently changed their fries and these are much better than their old ones.   Their side salads are awesome as well. They are decent in size- spring mix topped with sunflower seeds, raisins, half of a hard boiled egg (which I give to the boyfriend), chopped cucumbers and tomatoes and croutons. Yum!   I usually order the same thing every time I go. I steered off my normal path once and ordered the buffalo Mac and cheese and found it to be quite tasteless. Which turned me off to trying new items there. Plus I am just too in love with the Baja chicken sandwich and apple coleslaw to want to try anything else.   Service is always great, the bartenders are friendly... I love this place. Ask about their rock bottom rewards !",

Not bad but nothing great either. They were supposed to be shrimp AND lobster, but I was really disappointed to find only about 1-2 VERY small pieces of lobster on each taco. Being mostly shrimp, I do not think the taco was worth the $13.50. The shells were pretty different as well. It was a hard shell taco with a soft shell on the outside. I think they would be better with just the soft shell. 2 types of shell just adds extra calories and no extra flavor really. Another thing I thought was odd was that they come with lettuce inside instead of the usual shredded cabbage. They were decent, but again without the lobster it was not worth the money. The rice and French fries were very tasty, however!   Over half of the party ordered the mac & cheese, which I tried and it was really good! It came with bacon, chicken, and a few other things that I cannot remember, but next time I go I think that is what I will order.   Oh! Also a person at our table ordered the jalapeno pretzel sticks with some sort of warm dip and they were to DIE FOR. The dough was so warm and fresh I could not stop eating her appetizer lol. Definitely a must for next time as well.   Overall it was a good experience! They had the food out in a very timely manner given the size of our party. Again disappointed by the tacos, but everything else was good.",

    "text": "We decided to be basic and do dinner and a movie for valentines day. We hadn't been to Loews at the Waterfront, so decided on there. Since we were in the area, we also decided to dine at our favorite place at the Waterfront, Rock Bottom.   While at home, I hopped onto Open Table at 6pm to make a reservation. One was offered to me at 6:15 as well as 6:30. We went with the latter to avoid rushing. We arrive at 630pm and were informed by the host that we would have to wait another 45 minutes to be seated. We asked why and mentioned our reservation. He said manager insisted walk ins have priority over reservations. I have no idea what world they live in but that is a foolish rule. Why even bother being on Open Table if you aren't going to acknowledge those reservations? I have worked as a hostess at a fine dining restaurant using Open Table.. it is not a complicated system so unsure how they managed to not make it work. We were upset. The guy said he'd put our name down on the wait list and to come back at 715!!!!!!! My boyfriend asked to talk to the manager because that was just cray. Luckily the manager over-heard our entire conversation and said he could seat us now.   Walking through, I counted 7 open tables ready to be seated (plus our table). Since I worked in the food industry before, im assuming their kitchen was backed up which is why they didn't honor our reservation and needed more time before seating new guests. Fine, I get it. but explain it that way instead of saying \"walk ins have priority over reservations\".   Despite that hiccup, we had a great dinner. As always, we ordered the firecracker shrimp as an appetizer. We also ordered their signature Champagne Mojito. It was a little too bitter (cheap champagne im assuming) Next time we will order just regular mojito.   For entree, I went to the Ale Chicken which is chicken, mashed potatoes, veggies served with mushrooms ale sauce on top of it was delicious and I highly recommend. My fiance went with the Cuban Cristo.. a basic cristo which is then beer battered and deep fried. It was recommended by our server and bobby really enjoyed it.  There was an adorable paint night event in the side room. We still love Rock Bottom but I wanted to update with their official rule regarding reservations.",

This has to be one of the worst dishes I've ever had it was like pancake syrup over breaded chicken. To finish the meal we had the homemade chocolate chip cookies served with hot fudge. Well there was no hot fudge it was chocolate syrup the ice cream was so crystallized from melting and re-freezing all around disappointing.",

    "text": "First off, I will say that I just moved here from California and was a big patron at the Rockbottom in Long Beach. I came to the Homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location.  Now, Rockbottom is a chain brewery, so a lot was the same... the menu, the food prices (yet beer is cheaper, and I am fine with that). I have always found their food to be pricey, but they use excellent ingredients and it has always been tasty and filling so I am fine with that. The food here was just as good as the Long Beach location, so I have no problem with the chef at all.  Service was good, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. I wish that they had asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour was still going, but that isn't a big thing. Went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartender's attention, but he was very friendly and I got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned I had just moved here... I really enjoyed that.  Beer: We got the beer sampler to try the whole list... and, well... I found the dark beers a bit lacking in comparison. The light beer and the wheat were amazing, very impressed. The pale was ok, as was the velvet pale that was one of the specials of the night... but both were way too citrusy. The Uppity IPA was very good... I don't usually like IPAs because the hops overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance. Still, couldn't do a whole glass. I felt the Imperial Stout had a bitter burned taste that was overpowering... I almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it (not ice cream malt, for the non-homebrewers). The brown and amber were decent, but bland. I ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and was able to finish it all without forcing it.... one point up on Long Beach, who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass was empty.  I REALLY wanted to try the Das Gut Dopplebock, but they were out. Looks like they will have it in bottles to go soon so I hope I can catch that. Also want to try the Snow Moon Belgian.  Verdict: While I was not too impressed with the dark beers, I found the lighter ones very good and I look forward to trying the other seasonal beers. It is a good hour drive south to get there, so I won't be going too often, but I will be back.",

Desert :      Carrot Cake (to die for) Bar food:     Pizza or ball park pretzels.  Both of which are sprayed with brown ale.   Half the menu is really good, the other half is great.   The beer is good.  Ask for the sampler!  They usually have a velvet and something on cask.  Ask for one of those if you are looking for something different.  They will also have a scotch ale, an IPA, whiskey stout or other specialty depending on the mood of the brewer (which, if its still Matt, the mood is GRUMPY).   If Andy is still working there, he is sure to please and Molly is great in the cocktail area. Head over to Sing Sing after dinner and its a wrap. I used to work there several years ago and I make it a point to hit every RB I possibly can. Don't go to the one in Charlotte though, its not really a Rock Bottom.",

    "text": "I've always been pleasantly surprised with the food I've gotten at Rock Bottom.  I say \"surprised' because with any restaurant that falls into the slippery territory of a \"chain\", you expect to find your fair share of culinary duds.  But I've really had a lot of good meals at Rock Bottom.  Now, granted, you do owe it to yourself when ordering to not forget where you are (a \"bar-straunt\" if you will), and don't get anything above and beyond this place's call of duty.  For instance, I will never be ordering the ahi tuna.  I'll leave that to my favorite sushi bars and restaurants a bit closer to the water (the Mon doesn't count.....).  But besides that, I always really enjoy my meal choices.  I've recently gotten the chicken avocado sandwich.  Chicken was grilled perfectly, plenty of avocado, and it was a good sized sandwich without being excessive.  I've also ordered the Margherita pizza, which could definitely be split between two people.  It's an eight cut that comes to you on a big wooden pizza paddle.  The pizza was really great.  The crust was crispy, it had a good balance of cheese and tomatoes, and the basil pesto was fresh and tasty.  And not greasy whatsoever - BIG bonus points there.  But my biggest surprise as of late was when I ordered their chicken flautas.  I'm a HUGE Mexican food fan and always hesitate to order Mexican outside of a Mexican restaurant for fear of being disappointed.  But I had an insatiable craving one night and decided to go for it.  It was DELICIOUS.  The flautas are deep fried which gives you an amazing crunch, and they still managed to not dry out the inner ingredients.  The accompanying rice was nice and moist as well.  I was so happy!  I've always been quite happy with the service there as well.  I go on Thursday evenings for trivia, and nine times out of ten the service is really spot on.  The ladies servicing the bar area are friendly and attentive.  Only once or twice, to my memory, has my service been sub-par, and that can usually be chalked up to an extremely packed Trivia Night with only two visible servers helping 50+ people.

    "text": "SUMMARY: If I was in the area and no one had a better suggestion for where to go, I might come back for beer and appetizers.  GOOD: - Decent beer... - Original pretzel appetizer.  You take chunks of soft pretzel and dunk it in spinach cheese dip. - Huge portions.  Most of us had leftovers.  The RB Appetizer Sampler was multi-story and way more food that we could handle.  The half order of ribs looked like a full rack. - Attentive service with quick seating and frequent drink/water refills. - Amusing name.  BAD: - Lots of food choices... burgers... steak... chicken... salads.  Lots of drink choices... beers... wines... mixed drinks.  I guess this could be seen as good, but it takes a while for everyone to pick something and since no one's awesome at everything, you could tell right away that nothing distinguishes this place. - None of the food was super awesome.  Nothing was awful, but nothing stood out in any way.  I've had better beer, appetizers, and a better main course at plenty of breweries. - Kind of dead on a Monday night with 3/4 of the place empty.  Come if you want bar food, but keep your expectations low.",

I've been here a few times and have always gotten a burger, which are always juicy and fill you up, but if you're looking for something a little nicer, their Cajun Pasta is very good. It has sausage, ground chicken and shrimp, as well as linguine, so you will leave full and satisfied. The pasta was cooked well and the cream sauce had just a little kick to give the dish extra flavor. The service here is excellent, very pleasant and attentive. As soon as we sat down we had someone taking our drink order and our food came out quickly once we ordered it, despite our group being large. The atmosphere is casual and comfortable, great for a group of friends or family.",

They missed one great opportunity to make things right, but they blew it.   We decided on the Guacamole Made-To-Order. It wasn't made table side, and it wasn't all that good, just rather disappointing. The pizza, was pretty tasty, especially the crust.   I ordered the Oatmeal Stout, but it was only so-so.

However there was old food just sloshing around in the water and the bartender kept placing our drinks in the gross water.   We got the buffalo shrimp appetizer and the deep fried cuban sandwhich. Both were just ok and nothing spectacular or worth going back for. Not sure what is going on here but this place has tons of potential and should strive a little harder on all fronts.

As a former Restaurant Manager, of a restaurant in Pittsburgh that used to brew its own beer, I did once help the Brew Master make an ale, as part of the training. Craft beer is an inquired taste. I can drink it on occasion under the right circumstance.   Rock Bottom has never been our go-to craft beer place. I like going to Rock Bottom after the movies, because it is the only place open late, other than Eat-n-Park, which I do not like.   I love the Mac-Cheese with Bacon & Chicken. It is the dish I order every time. I am not much on the spices that they cook with for the other dishes. The rest of my family loves the spices dishes. The Mac-Cheese is a dish that I  highly recommend.   My  three stars is because of the service. The one thing I really dislike about this place,  is at night dinning, the side work and the cleaning the servers do when people are eating really bothers me. The service gets so slow because, the servers are doing their side work to complete their shift. I really dislike having the sweeper run under my feet or around the table when I am eating. I understand it totally, I get the concept BUT, I wouldn't sit any one in a section that the server is closing out. With the huge dining room area that they have, they had plenty of tables to leave until closing. This is the one pet peeve of mine when dining. When the servers are cleaning and taking care of the rest of their work, they tend to forget about the tables and customers they still have. It takes forever to get the bill or refills. I always ask for two glasses of water and the check when they drop of the food.",

    "text": "Grabbed an early dinner with a girlfriend tonight at Rock Bottom.  When we got there, we chose to eat outside as it was a beautiful day. The patio was nice with elevated (stool) seating, which may be a deal breaker for some, but the patio is not near the main road so not a ton of cars going by, a plus.   The waitress came to our table quickly to get our drink orders and I asked for the happy hour menu [I could not find it ANYWHERE prior to my visit so I added a pic to the Yelp posting, you're welcome :)]. Though the menu is quite small, especially with foods, the foods really are a great deal. An especially good value are the pizzas (choice of margherita or pepperoni), because they are a nice size (8 cut!) and very delicious, you will probably have leftovers as I did. My friend said that the seafood tacos were very good, and they did look very nice on the plate. Their greenhouse salad is also delicious and a good portion, and they have their own spin on it- there's raisins and salted sunflower seeds sprinkled on top. Normally I would be reluctant for these in a salad, but it just works! Their salad dressings are all homemade but the dressing cups are extremely small so I had to ask for another.  All in all, decent food, our service was great, food came within a reasonable period of time. Happy hour is the only time I can see myself coming here in the future because the food is worth the price you pay during happy hour. (I am giving 4 stars because I had a great meal at a great price with great service, but I can completely get why others would rate lower if they paid regular prices for the same food)",

Went here the other day with my colleagues from work for lunch, and I was beyond less than impressed with our meal.    Our service was great, a gentleman who truly hustled the whole time and kept our drinks filled (one of my biggest pet peeves when it doesn't happen!).  Because of how great he was, and the fact we were on a True time crunch, I didn't say anything about how unpleased I was with my meal.  I ordered a cup of their chicken tortilla soup, and their Chicken Waldorf salad.  Neither would I ever order again.  The soup was, in my opinion, terrible.  I don't know if it is just because I have had better, or had different expectations, but to me it was just bland, watered down and terrible.    The Waldorf salad was whole other ballgame.  It was supposed to have all these wonderful toppings on it, and these \"toppings\" were scarce and hard to find.  There were barely any grapes on it (maybe two or three halves?), two or three large clumps of the walnuts, a small scattering of sand grain sized blue cheese, and two little apple chips on top which were old, stale and soft.  All of this on a very large and plentiful mound of (fresh, at least) salad mix.  The chicken...... ugh... the chicken.  Maybe a couple very thin slices thrown on top...which did not taste very fresh.    This salad that I received was most certainly NOT the salad that I see other Yelpers posting.  If it had been, I'm sure I would have loved it.",

Veggie burgers are always good, too, though the staff sometimes seems confused when you order, say, the bourbonzola burger with a veggie burger.

Rock Bottom is definitely a solid bar. As a microbrewery, their beer list is full of house brews. There are better beers in the world, but there are a lot of worse beers out there, too.   What really makes Rock Bottom standout, though, is the food. My girlfriend and I shared an order of nachos, and it took everything we had to finish them. They also make a mean soft pretzel.   The Waterfront may not be the most convenient thing to do while in Pittsburgh, but no trip to the Waterfront, is complete without a bite and a drink at Rock Bottom.",

Join the Mug Club, even if you don't go often, and rack up points for free mugs and beers.  Thursdays are Trivia Nights and the DJ is playing the music loud, so go if you don't really want to have a conversation with the person you're with :)",

I will never forgive the idiot in management who took the chicken quesadilla off the menu. That said, I ordered the lobster roll and when it arrived, the bread was as hard as a brick and cold. The filling was okay, but the lobster flavor was masked by over spicing. I suggest you eat somewhere else and imbibe at the Rock Bottom.",

First surprise: decent beer.  I remembered the normal RB Brewery beers were not much to write home about but they had a couple of new styles, including a very good imperial IPA that for $5/glass cannot be beat.  Second surprise: pretty tasty food with a lot more healthy options than I expected.  Recommend the summer salad and the ahi tuna - both were great.   Service was a little slow (not sure why) so a 4-star review is downgraded to 3.5. I'll be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh for work.",

The waitress told us that they were not making mini appetizers and gave us a full sized chicken quesadilla. If you have ever had the southwestern egg rolls from Chili's - the filling tasted like that and I am a big fan!   Mondays are half off burger days and I tried the just hot enough burger - topped with crispy jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, pico de gallo and housemade habanero ketchup. It was delish! The ketchup was so good and the fries were extremely crispy.   The prices are a little steep for lunch but if you go on Monday, it's totally worth it. I think that the quality of food more than makes up for it but don't expect for pay under $10 for a sit down.   I felt that the staff was very nice and the waitress was very attentive. The service was quick and I think you can get in and out in under an hour.",

    "text": "When I went to Rock Bottom, I didn't know what to make of the restaurant.  Is it American food?  Mexican?  European?  There are no defining characteristics on the menu (or in the decor) that can help with this conundrum.  After eating at the restaurant, I did some research.  Rock Bottom is considered to be a brewery first, serving \"American style\" food. Upon entering, we first noticed the large bar, and pool tables at Rock Bottom.  It was a Saturday afternoon, so the bar wasn't hopping, but you could tell the staff was preparing for a busy night crowd.  Before lunch I decided to wash up (as I always do).  The bathrooms are located in the back of the restaurant, past the bar.  Behind the bar sits an enormous room containing large copper vats that ferment and produce their homemade beer.  I was amazed at the mammoth containers; how much beer can these things hold?  I sat and watched for a while as the brew masters checked gauges and temperatures- what a cool job! I returned to the table and looked at the beer menu; Light Lagers, Wheats, Red and Amber Ales, Brown Ales, Pale Ales, and Darks....how can you choose?  It was too early for me to drink, but my brother-in-law chose Ale.  I tried the beer; it was clear (no cloudiness; a trait that often eludes home brewers) and crisp, with lots of hoppy flavoring. The lunch and dinner menu is a labyrinth of different cultural cuisines.  Some of the appetizers include Brewery Nachos, Quesadilla Rolls, Guacamole and Chips, Spicy Spinach Cheese Dip, Buffalo Wings, Firecracker Shrimp, Seared Ahi, Ball Park Pretzels, Titan Toothpicks (chicken and cheese in tortillas), Edamame, Onion Rings, and a Sampler Platter.  Now, just try to explain to me which culinary avenue Rock Bottom is exploring here.  We chose to forgo the appetizers, but had small dinner salads that were fresh, with homemade dressings- very good. I ordered a standard Cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, cheddar and onion.  You can now choose your patty at Rock Bottom: try chicken, turkey, or ground beef, not a bad idea!  Also ordered were; a Reuben, Chicken wrap, Brewery Chili, and Steak Salad.  My burger was good; cooked medium with sharp cheddar cheese, and a fresh bun.  My Mom had the Reuben, and thought that the meat was very lean.  Believe me, if the corned beef wasn't to her specification, she would have let us know.  The bread was toasted nicely, and Swiss cheese was abundant, as it melted all over the sandwich. My sister thought her steak salad was good also- the meat was tasty and fresh.  My brother-in-law enjoyed his chili; not too spicy.    To me, Rock Bottom is an enigma; I'm not really sure what to make of it.  I need to put my reviews in classifications, but I can't with this one.  So, let's call it a brewery house with a diverse menu.  The food at Rock Bottom is really good, the portions are generous, the price is right. Also, the servers have always been courteous when I've eaten there.  I hear from reliable sources that it's a good place to go on Friday and Saturday nights.   Rock Bottom isn't a particularly expensive place to have lunch or dinner.  The food is well-prepared, and there are many choices if you have picky eaters in your group.",

My shower was wonderful, the wait staff was great and kept everyone's glasses full.  It started pouring down rain and they let us stay a little longer so my gifts wouldn't get wet when taking them out to the car.  The only reason this place gets 4 stars is because we were not allowed to take our leftover food from the buffet home.  There was salmon, chicken, potatoes, and mac and cheese left over and they told us we couldn't box it up.  Not sure why- they can't re-serve it!  It would have just gone to waste!

He got a burger covered in mozzarella cheese and I got a mahi sandwich.  Both great--the fries and side salads are good here too, and there is no skimping on portions of anything.  There were tons of things on the menu that I'm looking forward to trying.  We are usually not dessert people at all but ended the meal sharing a triple chocolate stout cheesecake--who can resist a beer cheesecake, come on!  Our food and service was great.  They had the Penguins game on all the TVs in the bar and were setting up live music for after the game.  Seriously, what's not to like!?  I'm thinking this place has changed for the better since the last review a year ago... :)",

The service is good, but the wait for food or a table can be quite long (generally 20-30 minutes even for just beer and apps).  I've been to the one at the Denver airport as well, but I was stranded and had free meal tickets, so okay-but-nothing-special pizza from Rock Bottom it was.  Since it's a recognizable national chain, I think of places like this as more of a tourist brewery rather than a True Pittsburgh craft-brew experience.",

    "text": "My husband and I stopped in this restaurant for lunch on Saturday. We easily got a table. The appetizer of Asiago Artichoke and Crab Dip had no visible crab or artichoke, was very runny like soup, and had visible puddles of oil. It looked nothing like the picture of it on Rock Bottom's website, and it was the lowest-quality artichoke and crab dip that I have ever received at a restaurant. We told our waiter that we were dissatisfied with the dip. He apologized and took it away. I think that this was the only time in my life when I have sent a dish back to the kitchen. A short while later, the manager came over to apologize for the dip, and she offered us free desserts if we wanted. Our entrees of an avocado chicken and bacon sandwich and a cheeseburger tasted much better. We declined the free desserts, although we did appreciate the offer. Our waiter remembered to bring out drink refills. Our table and chairs were clean. There were TVs for us to watch while we ate.",

The location is perfect in the Waterfront because it is close to everything and within walking distance to all of the great attractions in the development (shopping, entertainment etc). Even if you don't want quick bar food, the menu has a lot more to offer with entrees and they are all great.   I definitely recommend the tacos and the flight of beers. Great beer selection!  You definitely need to check this place out and it is also connected to the dueling piano bar Sing Sing. Also a great time and they offer free admission sometimes with your receipt from Rock Bottom that shows you have dined there.",

I believe the norm for a restaurant is max 40 minutes and even then, that's a long time and there are some apologies that come along when the food comes out.  Waitress was just ok. I don't think I saw her smile once...which is fine, some people done smile. However,  she wasn't very friendly.   Uppity jagoff IPA was delicious.   For aesthetic reasons, they could use a smaller plate for the pork flautas. They took up less than half the plate.   Guacamole appetizer is $10. Steep for the amount you receive.   Food was ok. Added with the food time-delay, I'd probably stop by elsewhere before my Dave and Buster's trips.",

The menu has changed a few times since I started eating there (and being a hostess there for a very short amount of time a few years ago), and some of my favorite items are no longer on the menu. However, the old standby is still there: jalapeno pretzel sticks. And boy, they are phenomenal. Not only are they JALAPENO PRETZEL STICKS, but the dip they come with is delicious, creamy spinach dip. It's almost too much.   On this particular visit I ordered the chicken tostadas, and they were very good! Flavorful, a good ratio of toppings, and the tortillas underneath were just the right amount of crispy. Overall, if you want easy, approachable, American bar food, Rock Bottom is a good choice.",

Thank goodness I am not anaphylactic, but it makes me very sick the next day, similar to food poisoning with chills, vomiting, and severe fatigue.   Of course, I informed my server right away at the beginning of our meal, \"I am allergic to capsicum, which means I can't have any kind of peppers\" and asked him to make sure none was included with our guacamole dish.   The guacamole came out and after eating some I commented to my boyfriend, \"Does this taste spicy to you?\" He thought it didn't so we continued eating since we couldn't see any peppers in the guacamole. I was also starving.   My burger came out cooked perfectly, but there was red flakes all over my fries. I asked my server, \"Excuse me, what seasoning is on these fries?\" \"Oh it's a combination of things, like paprika and some other stuff\" \"Paprika is made from peppers,\" I explained, and asked him to bring me new fries without any seasoning. His response was \"oh, I assumed seasoning would be fine.\" That's when I looked closer at the chips that came with the guacamole and saw they also had this seasoning all over them.  They brought me new fries and everything tasted delicious, which is why I gave them 2 stars. But thanks to poor training and assumptions that I could eat things I explained I was allergic to, I spent all of the next day extremely sick. Allergies need to be taken seriously!!!",

My sandwich was wrong, with an ingredient I literally cannot eat.  Instead of apologizing or anything he just grabbed the sandwich away from me.  When he brought the new one all he said was \"ta da\", so with that we asked for our check.  Didn't get an apology for the mess up, didn't get a thank you for dining at the restaurant.

    "text": "Strictly based on the food not the beer, Rock Bottom is descent.   The menu is extensive and a lot of the dishes sound really great, but nothing actually tastes good.The mixed drinks are weak and the quality and seasoning of the food is pretty bad. The service is consistently good.   1. Sangria tasted like Kool-Aid, very weak.   2. The vegetable medley is terrible, mushy, tasteless, very Wal-Mart.  3. The salmon was extremely over cooked, dry, and tasteless.  4. The garlic rib eye had a descent taste, but it was 6oz of meat and 6oz of fat. Half of the steak was completely inedible because of the fat and poor cut.  I wouldn't come back unless forced by a group of beer drinking friends.",

He thought that those were the best that he ever had. My oldest son had the chicken mac-n-cheese. He thought that it was very good. We all shared the calamari and jalapeno appetizer-- very spicy, but very good. We also had the buffalo wing appetizer. The sauce was very good, but the wings were OK. The brownie dessert was a little disappointing. The brownies were dry. I also had the key lime dessert. It was OK. The service was outstanding. The atmosphere was vibrant and enjoyable. We will definitely return the next time that we are in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "Rock Bottom is a nice hangout place. Often when you are out and about with friends you arrive home with no voice from screaming over all of the background noise. Great if your out to see a band, but not so much fun if you actually want to talk to the people sitting around you.   Depending on your mood you can sit in the dining area full of booths and tables. It's alittle separated from the main bar area so provides for a semi quiet dining area. The bar area gives you a choice of sitting at the surrounding tables with waitress service or hanging out at the bar itself. Complete with a chillie ice strip to keep those yummy brews cold and the ever entertaining company of your favorite bartender. When the weather cooperates the outdoor patio houses about 6 tables for outdoor dining. The view however...not so picturesque, just the entrance to the Improv. Which hey, that could be the perfect seat if you're stocking the local comics!   The bar area contains pools tables and dart boards to try your skills. On any give night sports fans can enjoy the games of the day on one of the 6 big screen TVs surrounding the bar area.   The menu is pretty decent with burgers that are cooked to order with the choice of either steak , veggie or chicken. They have a number of specialty burgers with different cheeses, toppings and creative themes. The bourbonzolla is a tasty burger with a Bourbon based glaze and Gorgonzola cheese. Appetizers which range from nachos to firecracker shrimp. Steaks, pasta and salads with rotating specials from different areas of the menu.   On Monday the burgers are half off...I don't think you have to be a member of their mug club to get the special. However, if you are here regularly the mug club is great with free gifts and specials.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rockbottom.com%2FMC&s=ed772c51b4bdee649632e2f4d4a1302f8e6b876596cd89cda2a01c33c456bb4f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">rockbottom.com/MC</a>   Needless to say I have a fun beer glass collection thanks to Rock Bottom...LOL!   Now everyone favorite part about Rock Bottom's Beers!  The in house brew master keeps it interesting with a rotating variety of frothy yummy to try along with the consistant favorites of Ale, IPA's, Rotating Darks and Kolsch.   Stop by on Thursday nights for a colorful game of trivia where teams battle it out in a game of intelligence and drinking skills!",

My friends and I love the atmosphere, the DJ (Todd), and the service that we get at Rock Bottom.   Every week when we go a menu is never needed because we pretty much know everything we want on it, except for when the change the menu from time to time and we get to have a special treat with something new!   As an avid Rock Bottomer, hands down I have never in my life had a better spicy spinach cheese dip than I have had here at Rock Bottom. Whether I have eaten dinner or not before I come down to the restaurant, my favorite and my food of choice is the ENORMOUS Ball park pretzels with the cheese dip. It is a meal itself! The mixture of onions, cheese, spinach and tomatoes is perfection!   Another favorite of mine is the Barbecue Chicken Pizza, it has a great kick to it and it's big enough for two people.   The service has always been super great and now since we go often we have developed a great relationship with some of the wait staff.   A truly great place to have fun with friends and meet new people!   Come to Team Trivia every Thursday at 8pm!",

The food was great until the steak and shrimp came with the broccoli. It was not good, the broccoli was burnt bad and I ask medium well and they sent it bloody. My boyfriend's bison burger was not that tasty either he sent it back. They sent the burnt broccoli back and I got a great salad, the steak had to go all the way to well done, but I believe the grill is not being clean properly cause the steak tasted burnt and charred. So the manager came over and ask my boyfriend if he wanted something else, he didn't and he asked me how he could make it better, I asked that next time could we have are food done properly cooked. He apologized and actually looked out with discounting the meal and gave us fresh spinach dip, which I enjoyed.

    "text": "Even since Rock Bottom opened (7 years ago???) I have always thought it was a dance club.  I am not really sure why but I thought it was along the same line as (throw back) Hi-Tops but I did. I think I always thought this place was a club because of the behemoth size of the space.   Well I was out with a friend and we needed a place to go before a show at the Improv and Rock Bottom was close.   Part of this is my fault...I always order \"healthy\" items at places that specialize is greasy bar food...then I am upset when the meal isn't 5 star.    I started off with one of their wheat beers, it was alright. I nursed it all through dinner so I don't think I was head over heels in love with it.  I got the Catch of the Day, Off the Hook, Fish Dish, Sailors Delight or something(I forget it had some cheesy fish themed name).  It was cod (meh, that should have been the sign not to get it) with roasted asparagus and lemon rice.  The fish was suppose to be broiled but it had a thick breading (annoyed) and the portion of fish was tiny. The rice and asparagus were great though.   My friend got a chicken sandwich which he enjoyed although the fries were pathetic.  The fries were probably pre-cut frozen fries or just very poorly executed.  They were so thin that you have to grab a huge handful just to get any actual potato flavor.  Pros: A lot of tables (no wait), brew special beers, big menu, could hear the dueling piano bar next door  Cons: Place was fairly empty and we got a crappy table by the door when it was 5 degrees outside, most of the food was fried, cheese filled, cream based, or wrapped in bacon.  I know some people love to eat food like this all the time( I do every once in awhile) but if you eat out a lot you can't always get the spin dip, burger, and ice cream sundae.  (I would love to but its just not in my cards). I do like like when causal places offer some healthy options.",

    "text": "We just came from dinner at Rock Bottom. We sat in the bar area instead of the dining room this time because my husband wanted to the basketball game. Maybe this was our mistake. Our waitress was awful! We waited an unusually long time before she even got to our table to order our drinks. Because they are a microbrewery the beers change and we couldn't remember the one we liked so we asked to share a sample of two. This is something they do all the time. She seemed impatient and when she brought the sample she just slapped it on the table without telling us which was which! When I ordered the one I liked I asked for an orange slice because it was a wheat beer. Also extra napkins. Well it arrived, no orange and no napkins. It was though she really didn't care what we wanted! When we reminded her she abruptly walked away the slapped a dish with an orange slice but again no napkins. When my husband mentioned it again she very rudely said \"I am very busy!\" No apologies, just rudeness. I guess we didn't matter as much as her other guests. Most people in the bar area just order appetizers and drinks but we were ordering dinner and drinks. Being busy is a good thing for a business and if you can't handle it you should maybe think of something else you can do that you might be better at. Having said this, the times we have sat in the dining area we have always had decent service. But this really made us angry and I do not think we will be going back.",

The wait time isn't terrible if you go a little later on a friday or Saturday night. And they most often call you before the quotes time.

The food was standard pub fare with a twist, well-executed.  My burger was topped with onion petals and gorgonzola, and cooked to perfection.  The waitress recommended their macaroni and cheese for a side, which was definitely a good choice.

It arrived in a huge doughy-like clump that when pulled apart we had discovered some had gone uncooked. The replacement appetizer was much better but we were a little shocked that the first one even made it to the table (it looked terrible). The jambalaya was more than lacking. The sauce tasted very bland. The andouille sausage tasted like the plastic bag it had been stored in. The only good thing I could say about it was it had huge chunks of pulled chicken. Too bad it wasn't good. Their pizza is pretty good and the portion is decent! Unfortunately, we ended up very sick after dinner (most likely the calamari).

I noticed a Ball Park Pretzel, with a jalapeno cheese dip. I was blown away, the fact that I got 2 pretzels amazed me. I ordered within 25 minutes of seating. My pretzels hit the table within minutes. The smell of the warm salt and hot cheese opened my senses. But I knew we could step this shit up, I asked for mustard. And what do you know. Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard is in front of my eyes. I combined that shit and life evolved.

    "text": "Rock Bottom has a sizable menu with all things one would expect at a brew pub that is a full service restaurant. The number of Mexican cuisine offerings seems to be growing. The food seems to be reliably good.It's also excellent for groups! I've been there several times with groups. While the most recent time was only seven, some in the past have been large groups (one of 20, and another with over 30) on weekend evenings and I'm thoroughly impressed with the friendly, efficient and professional manner in which the accommodate groups. Whether increasing the number of diners at the last minute or providing separate checks, they are flawless. Lots of other restaurants could learn from them. Impressively, even with providing separate checks to such large groups, they've always chose not to add gratuity (and we obliged with good tips), They also managed to deliver food to everyone at the same time, and processed payment of the checks in no time at all. Bravo to this restaurant's management and service staff, it's top notch. My only complaints are related to the beer -- both the taste and attempting to choose one. Choosing one was difficult as the large menu chalkboard didn't have ABVs listed on it  , the beer on cask condition was not the one listed on the menu board and there was at least one other discrepancy between the beer list on the table and the menu board. And what's listed on the restaurant's website for this location isn't even close. In addition, the server was not able to answer a fairly simple question about one of the beers (but she went and asked a bartender), which was surprising for a brew pub, but it should be noted that otherwise, the service was flawless. I wasn't impressed with the two beers that I tried (and I'm not remotely a beer snob).The Good Neighbor Kolsch wasn't as smooth as I'm used to getting from any Kolsch, including ones that I've had here in the past. The Life's A Peach wheat with mango and peach had a bit of a bite to it as well.",

    "text": "I always enjoy Rock Bottom. Standard beers on tap are always great and their rotating selection usually has a hit as well.   I prefer the bar seating as to the dining room, but this is a good way to separate the family dining from those of us without kiddos.   Nachos, nachos, nachos. Truly the best in the area. Great burgers, chili and salads. Really...I don't think I've had a bad meal here. Nice outdoor seating in the summer.   This is a great place to watch a game or just hang out. Iced counter at the bar to keep your drink cold.  I know they have other cocktails here, but I can't order them at a beer place. I've seen them and they do look good, but I'm stuck to the beer selection.   They have a great happy hour and specials throughout the week.   Service is always great whether there are two or 10 of us.",

    "text": "Every time I've been here the food has always been delicious and the service has always been very exceptional. My go to is the Laredo burger and the Mac n'cheese as a side. They Mac n' cheese is absolutely wonderful if you like garlic! I've had a few other menu options as well that have been superb. The beers on tap are always great. My newest favorite is the First! Pumpkin Ale.   One thing I really appreciate about Rock Bottom is that they aren't one of these restaurants that try to rush you out when you're done eating. The food comes out fast (which is great when you're starving!) but if you want to stay an visit with your date or eating companions there's never any rush. I was just at Rock Bottom last night meeting friends for a movie that didn't start until 11pm. We got at the restaurant around 7:30, ordered drinks, ate and had a few more drinks and then just hung out for about a half hour until it was time to Walk over to the cinemas. It was nice not feeling rushed to leave as soon as we stopped ordering.  My only complaints are that sometimes meat ends up being cooked a little more than you often ask. Medium often turns into medium well, but that's not a huge problem for me. I also don't think the signature cocktails are worth $9, but that's more of a corporate complaint since Rock Bottom is a small chain.   Overall I definitely recommend eating here if you're in the Waterfront!",

We tried two beer flights so we could have the entire beer menu. The flights are priced exceptionally well. We had the nachos for an appetizer, which were good but not the best I've ever had. I had the Brewer's Cobb, which has always been amazing at every Rock Bottom I've ever been to and an extraordinary amount. My husband had the beef tips, which tasted good but didn't have a lot of meat. It left him wanting more. The mashed potatoes and onion straws paired with the tips were good though. The atmosphere was great, it was clean, and our server was friendly and attentive. Very happy with the experience.",

    "text": "I went to Rock Bottom this past weekend, and it was \"nice\" to see that nothing has changed in the year or two since my last visit. While the beer is pretty good, it has never outweighed the fact that the service isn't good and the food is average, at best.  It was even difficult to get beers at the bar...we tried to have the girls order, thinking they'd have better luck...when that failed, the men tried...that didn't work either. If we hadn't REALLY wanted a cold beer after a comedy show at The Improv, we would've just left. It definitely wasn't busy enough to be noticed and ignored by the bartender, so I can't overlook it. Of course, the service has always been spotty at Rock Bottom, so it was hardly surprising.  Combine the weak food and poor service with Rock Bottom being too far from home for a night out just to drink, and you get the exact formula that's kept me from going there in the past...and will keep me from going often in the future.",

    "text": "I love Rock Bottom. I don't frequent the restaurant side of RB as much as I do SingSing, but the food comes from RB. I order practically the same thing every time (Bacon Mac 'n Cheese, Brewery Nachos, and a beer...usually an IPA or a Manhattan) and the last two times I was at RB, the food was disappointing: it was cold and unappetizing, my Manhattan sucked, and the service was worse. The food is always better over at SingSing for some reason...even if they do come from the same place!   I was craving the Mac 'n Cheese, so I went down to pick some up. I had a gift card, so I figured I wasn't out any money if the food sucked. I saw that there was a new menu, so I sat down to order. I got the Street Food Quesadilla, Bacon Mac 'n Cheese, and Beer Battered Onion Rings. I also ordered a Homemade Root beer and a few samples of the house beer.  Everything was amazing! It came out hot and tasted awesome. They have a new Head Chef and it shows. I was floored...the new Street Food options are fun and tasty. They are unique and different...not something you'd find at any restaurants in the area.  The Service was good. My waitress was named Liz and she certainly was on point. She even helped me find a beer after I was sorely disappointed by the IPA offering...which was weird. I always thought the House Brews were tasty and fun, no matter their style or make. I'm an IPA girl, but I would happily drink anything that came from their taps. I was disappointed in the offerings, but I ended up settling on the Pale Ale that was quite tasty.  In the end, if you were turned off by Rock Bottom before, I'd definitely recommend going back to check out the Street Food and new menu offerings. Service has dramatically improved, food quality has improved,  and I was thrilled.",

I was with one other person and we waited upwards of 50 minutes for a table. When we were finally sat it was by the door where it was really drafty. It was below freezing out, and we were both really cold. The food was great though when it came, and it somewhat warned us up. We ordered the tortilla soup, nachos, Diablo pizza, and 2 am burger. The soup was delicious. I'm itching to have another bowl already. I also tried their darkest beer that had hints of cacao and peanut butter. I'm not a beer fan, but I really liked it. Our waitress was extremely nice as well. We were comped 20 something dollars when we didn't even complain or say anything. It was a nice surprise when we got our bill. I'll definitely be back.",

This was one of the few places in the waterfront that accepted reservations, so we made reservations here before the comedy show at the Improv. I think this is one of the few places that takes reservations because they'll do anything to ensure a soul will walk in there and spend money. Our server started with a bang. Energetic. Nice personality. I guess he didnt realize that you actually have to check back on your table throughout the dining experience. Im still waiting on a refill. Most people will still consider it a \"positive experience\" if the wait for the food is long but the server updates you along the way. My updates on my food that was taking too long- Rock Bottom. Thank goodness we could leave there and go laugh and forget about this Rock Bottom experience. (Once too many?)",

Going through the menu one thing that caught my eye was the BBQ Brisket Stuffed Burger.  That just sounded so good.  Unfortunately the reality didn't match the idea of the burger.  The favor of the BBQ never came through and the smoked Gouda flavor was none existent. It was like having a standard old boring burger.  I was very disappointed.  For $14, I would have expected a lot more flavor.  I would not recommend this burger unless they do something to bunch up the flavor.",

The other folks in our party mentioned that the burgers were pretty good; however, my Cuban Cristo was a mess.

It's one of the most unique veggie burgers I have ever had: a homemade patty of beans, rolled oats and veggies. The chipotle mayo really gave it that oomph. My burger was more than enough for me to handle and everything was worth the price. As for drinks, I'm a complete noob when it comes to beer but my friend ordered a tap and even from a small taste, I could tell it was very good quality beer. Bitter and sweet, with a slight tang. I rarely drink beer but i I'm going to, then might as well drink the best kind there is - fresh and microbrewed.  NOTE: There aren't too many options for vegetarians. The veggie burger was pretty good and I'd recommend it, but other than that, there's also the veggie tacos, a few select appetizers, and a few salads from which to choose.",

I ordered the hibiscus wheat beer and my friend ordered the white wheat, both of which are brewed by Rock Bottom. They both tasted delicious and were exactly what I needed for a hot day. My friend ordered the Fried chicken entree which came with mashed potatoes and of course she gave me a few bites since we always share. It was a pretty delicious meal, but the fried crust fell off a few pieces which I am not really a fan of. I ordered the Sante fe salad with grilled chicken not fried. The salad was okay I was expecting more flavors overall, but I didn't really get them.   It was a good experience and will most likely be back when I am around the waterfront area.",

It's pretty much always packed around happy hour/dinner time because it's a great spot.   The Pittsburgh location doesn't quite compare. The actual layout, food, service, etc., is average. I ordered the bison burger last night and it was pretty good. But, it was a bit dry and it didn't seem like they put much effort into it. Honesty, when I received my food, it reminded me of being at a place like Applebee's of Chili's. They were out of Mac and cheese because they had had a busy night. I didn't mind that at all because I had tried the Mac and cheese before; you should give it a try if you haven't.   The waitress was great. She checked in often to make sure we were comfortable. The menu is large. You're sure to find something you want to try. But it's a brewery, so the options are mostly variations of bar foods. It's a cool place to go if you want to eat late and have a decent sized group with you.",

No matter the time of day or day of week! The menu offers a lot of choice, but not a lot of non beef or non fish options.  The service is always a little slow.  And the tables are sticky! I do like their light beer, but since the bathroom is deplorable, the last thing I want is to drink beer!  Sorry Rock Bottom, I gave you a fair shot, but I won't be back.",

There was literally one bite of chicken in the meal. One person ordered a burger and was brought the wrong one. Three others ordered the 2am burger. They said they were out of hash browns so they substituted with one sad onion ring. The burgers were a disappointment. The server seemed to be doing her best but the kitchen was way behind and had everything backed up.  Overall the drinks were bad and the food was of low quality. We definitely won't be coming back. Rock bottom describes this place perfectly.",

I asked for medium cooked and they gave me burnt. instead of caramelized onions, they added raw onions. they should check the quality of jalapenos they use, it was not hot at all. they also forgot to add mayo. ohh and they took 50 minutes to prepare this burger, and we missed our movie at amc.  the waiter did not even bother to ask if everything was okay. won't visit again.",

The enchiladas were supposed to be chicken and had two tiny strips of chicken and I'm talking minuscule.   Rice was still cold when it was served a second time a half hour later.   Manager apologized and waitress offered us something while we waited for our food for the second time.   I don't know whose fault it was, but there are clearly some problems in house.   I'll take the blame for ordering chicken enchiladas at a brewery but wow, they were so horrid!",

    "text": "Good:  Beer and cocktails are good and reasonably priced. - apparently brewed in house right behind the bar? A unique selection - the beer version of my favorite coffeeshops, hah. Vibe is super chill - great place to relax, watch the game, and grab some drinks. Service is attentive and friendly.  Meh: Food is quite expensive for the quality and portion. The menu is uninventive and leans completely toward heavy... or a salad. Clog artery or eat like rabbits :( Their salads probably aren't super healthy either. Not a place I'd go just to eat their food, and they probably know this. You go to grab a drink, you get hungry, eat food out of convenience.  I guess not a place I'd go out of my way to visit for a drink, either. but for being in the waterfront - if i'm in the area, it's an option.",

    "text": "Meh.  That sums it up for all my experiences here.  I always go in with high hopes, and come out having had a so-so experience.  The beer doesn't really float my boat.  Although, they did have a pretty decent sour when I was there a couple of weeks ago.  The first time out of my 5-6 visits I found something I liked.  The food is okay.  Like most restaurants, they don't have a TON of vegetarian selections, but definitely enough that I felt like I had options.  My partner and I had veggie burgers during our last visit there.  Nothing special.  The fries were pretty good.  Liked how they were seasoned.  One thing that really stunk about our last trip was the amount of time it took to get our food.  It wasn't our server's fault, and she did check on us once to say sorry for the delay.  We were also dining with friends who'd had such a horrible experience the last time they came that management gave them $70 worth in gift cards for the restaurant and offered to comp their last meal.  Geeze!  Kind of stinks that when you give the place another try with the gift cards, things are still lacking.  We'll probably visit again, but this isn't my first choice for dinner when going to the Waterfront.  One thing I will say is it has adequate seating for large groups, and loud children would probably make out okay here as it gets pretty packed on the weekends.  A good place to take family from out of town.",

The manger brought out the new one and he took care of our friends check. Pretty great service. She loved the burger, and said it was one of the best she has had.
