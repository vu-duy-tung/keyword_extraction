    "text": "Saturday night. Table for 2. We walked in a little before 8 PM and saw only 4 tables seated (2 of which were larger parties). Despite that, the noise level was insane. I had to shout at my friend and the waiter had to crouch down to hear me. The decor looks like they tried so hard to be cool but it just looks like everything else out there. Or worse - something staged at Target.   Our waiter was awkward in his interactions and came off a little unsure. As someone in the service industry, you should know what an Arnold Palmer is. I ordered the Bloomfield and my friend ordered the Fox Chapel (both medium well). It took close to 40 minutes to get our burgers. His fries looked like they were sitting out for a few days and so did my mac n cheese, but to our surprise, both were tasty. Still, you eat with your eyes, ya know?   The thing that got me was the fact that they tout F2T, but they drown these burgers in toppings. I couldn't taste the meat at all through the sauteed greens and my friend's burger had so much goat cheese that the meat took a backseat to that flavor. I understand wanting to dress up a burger, but shouldn't farm to table meat be the one stealing the show?",

    "text": "I had to try this new place. When I walked in, first first impression was how clean, open, and, new the place looked. I really liked the wooden table tops, they were beautiful. I appreciated the wheel chair accessibility to the second level, and that the floor was offset with to tiers as it was. I liked the open, high ceilings and industrial look of the place. The design is very modern.  The only negative critique I have is how noisy it was. The tables were only about a third capacity and I imagine the noise only getting worse with more being served. Service was good, I was seated immediately, no wait. The waitress did an ok job, but, didn't do anything to be welcoming or introduce anything about the place it the menu. With it being new I kind of expected more from the wait staff. The food was ok. I had the rosemary fries, they were seasoned well, didn't need anything added, they had a nice crunch to them, tasted fresh, and, I'd have them again. I had the Pitts burger. The portion was very very small for the price. I requested rare but got medium well instead. You can see that in the photo I'll add. Overall, I think they have some work to do. Such as something to decrease the noise; curtains, drapes, cloth to catch the echo. And either the portion has to go up or the price come down, but, the hamburger was worth a third of the tab. I was left asking, \"where's the beef\". Again, look at the photo. I will try and give them a second chance in a month or so.",

And then finally.....2 burgers 2 orders of french fries, and 2 waters.....$32.24 with tip.  Needless to say, the next time I have a hankering for a burger, I'll just make it myself",

I ordered the Polish Hill which is a burger with cheese, caramelized onions, and pierogies. It was cooked to a perfect medium and tasted great. Unfortunately they don't have their liquor license yet but the bartender, Randolf, was nice enough to offer me one of the beers that had been given to them from a rep free of charge. Free beer is always the way to my heart! I will definitely be returning and telling friends!",

    "text": "Decent burger place that opened in the Lawrenceville area. Apparently this place is well known in the North Hills area and they decided to open a location in the city. Great timing as I was coming off work & decided to drop by to try their wares. Ended up taking a Maggie's Farm (smoked gouda, horseradish, caramelized onions, roasted chilies, rum aioli, plus patty [medium rare, I chose]) and a half side of rosemary fries to go. As for the fries, they were decent though I found the rosemary a bit overpowering to my taste buds. Would recommend they go a little lighter with the use of such seasoning in general. As for the burger itself? Pretty good overall. I wouldn't place the patty quality as good as that of BRGR or Burgatory as it was also rather lacking in flavor/juice, but I'd probably consider such passable and better than fast food burger patties (a slight step up). It's nice that they have a build-your-own option though that's probably more expensive, sandwiches, shakes, sodas, salads, other sides, and more so that's a plus for food variety. Will have to try other things and update accordingly. Overall though, would recommend other places to go for better tasting burgers.",

The burger was juicy, flavorful, and I loved the addition of the chile/pepper. I didn't taste much horseradish, but it doesn't matter. The burger was great. It came with a side salad with garlic vinaigrette. Loved the dressing, loved the lettuce. My friend ordered the fries. They are thin and perfectly seasoned. I love how this place uses salt. There is a perfect shard of salt in every bite.  Salt angel. We travelled to the harmony location several times based on some article about them being the best burger in Pittsburgh and I'm happy they opened their second location in Pittsburgh. I hate the metal plates in harmony though, they mess with my body.",

It wasn't busy in the restaurant when we arrived. There were only a few people at a few tables, which was great because I was really hungry. However, I have to say that our service was very slow. It took a long time for us to give our order. Then a family of 5 came in much after us and they received their meals before us. My mom and I actually even ordered the same exact thing, so it was a very easy order.  Outside of the slow service, the burger was good. I ordered the Forest Hills burger. It had bleu cheese, honey, mushrooms, and mixed greens.  It was cooked well and plated nicely. I also got rosemary fries. There is an upcharge for it, but they were really good.  The atmosphere was relaxed. Your typical mixed industrial feel. There were big TVs over the bar area and it has an open kitchen.   I would try out the restaurant again. The food was good enough for a return visit.",

I'll make it easy for you: skip Burgh'ers and got to BRGR or Burgatory for a good, quick, reasonably priced burger.",

The highlights include friendly service, a menu with a wide variety of craft burgers, and specialty cocktails featuring spirits from Pennsylvania. I enjoyed the Mexican War burger. I really liked that the keto-friendly option of serving the burger on a romain wrap was right on the the menu - no special request necessary. There's also a vegetarian option. Very accommodating. The side salad with bleu cheese dressing was good too. On the Friday night I visited there was no wait for a two-top. There's plenty of room for small groups. I recommend Burgh'ers and I'll go back.",

I'm not a fan of Bleu cheese (included with the burger) so I asked for cheddar but was told it would be an up charge. Why do you charge more for cheese when you are replacing with another cheese? Food came out and fries were cold and macaroni wasn't cooked the whole way. Burgers were a little small but tasted good. Chicken was nice sized. We had a Groupon but don't think we'd come back without another one. $14 for each burger, too expensive for what you get. Can go elsewhere for cheaper and better burger and fries",

Between the Pittsburgh-themed decor, the burrow-themed burger names or the fact that the majority of what they serve is locally sourced, Burgh'ers is really Pittsburghy.   I got the fox chapel burger and I really enjoyed it. #TheBlend (50% meat, 50% mushroom) was unique and tasty. Really a great burger if you're a fan of goat cheese. The pierogies we got for the table($10) were also delicious, but the menu doesn't point out that they serve you 4 and they are fried. That is all fine, I'm sure I could've just asked but $2.50 a pierogi is expensive(even though they are also locally sourced.)    Kristen was a joy to have as a hostess as well, accommodating and friendly; Not to mention she stuck around to answer the random questions we had about the plates, owner, her preferences etc.  All in all, good burger, good service, decent prices.

Otherwise very tasty! My husband made his own burger and I got a chicken sandwich with side salad. The food was EXCELLENT. Chicken sandwich was fresh and bun stayed crisp, not soggy, despite the multiple  toppings on the sandwich. My husband's burger was cooked to the right temp and his rosemary fries were AMAZING (obviously I had to try some). Overall this place was excellent and he has already been back since our visit.

The street sign advertised BYOB and our waiter said they are planning on getting a liquor license but it sounded like it will be a while.  So bring along a couple of beers or some wine to enjoy with your burger.  Service was fast and friendly.   I had the Pitts burger that has cheddar, slaw, pickle, basil, onion and a special sauce.  My burger was cooked to my order and was tasty.  I thought the toppings were good but the special sauce seemed to lack that Zip I was expecting.

Friendly service, attentive service but when I addressed two things - the macaroni and cheese was too salty and my daughter couldn't eat it, nothing was offered to correct the situation. When our food first arrived, there was an immediate check to see if all was good. First bite was good, then we were not checked on until the end of the meal, where the two complaints were made. My other complaint was the fried chicken, the first bite was good until I realized that all three of the pieces on my plate were dark meat. I can tolerate dark meat but I did not expect the meal to be entirely dark meat. I would have never ordered it. When I expressed my disappointment,  again no offer to remedy the situation.   The three burgers that were ordered at the table were all tasty but the consensus was that they ran small for the pricing of them. The fries were delicious and plentiful. The draft beers were great. Stick to burgers and fries and if you don't mind the pricing for the patty size, you will be fine. We much prefer the 16.00 huge, multi meat cut burger at Eleven.  There was plenty of loud music to be heard. I don't know if every day is 80's day but you can manage to tune out the Phil Collins and Billy Joel if you try.",

Great server that we had , he took our orders quickly and with a great attitude. He definitely made the meal better. 2 If is had build your own burgers and they were super tasty. Nice size and cooked perfectly . The rosemary fries were very tasty as well as the Mac and cheese which was super yummy and cheesy. One of us had the impossible burger which is vegan and I truly could not taste any difference than the full fat beef burger we were eating. I was blown away at how great hat burger tasted. Excellent draft list and cocktail list. Only weird thing was they only had soda in single cans , maybe the other sodas were free refills but a Diet Coke was in a can. I will be back to this place without hesitation . Check it out you will dig it.",

It was freezing on the night we headed to the Lawrenceville location...and when we arrived we were hoping for a warm welcome, but the restaurant itself was so cold I kept my jacket on the whole time. Not so great.  We got the pierogi appetizer, which was pretty good - you only get 4 pierogis for $10...which is pretty lame.  I got the Polish Hill burger. I ordered it medium well and it definitely came out medium, but I'm not that picky and the burger was good. My husband got the make your own burger and was happy with his choice. The fries were good too.    Overall, the food was good - nothing spectacular. Four stars because it wasn't cooked to order and the price point is steep for what you get (and the chilly atmosphere), but worth a try for the fun menu options.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were excited to try this place since it's so close to our apartment and have gone a couple times now. Unfortunately, it's just ok, nothing great. It probably won't become a regular spot we check out very often.  Our first visit was during their soft opening, my boyfriend had a basic double cheeseburger and fries. I had the Mexican War burger without the chilies and paid the $1 extra for the rosemary fries. We split a chocolate milkshake. The milkshake was made with Millie's ice cream, which was the selling point. However it was kind of poorly made, it looked kind of like the blender was broken, it was kind of just mushed up ice cream with some milk added to it. It was thick in parts, but then super soupy in other parts. We decided it wasn't a big deal since it was their soft opening, it was still decent just because it was made with Mille's ice cream.   My boyfriends double burger was huge, despite the pattys being a little thinner than some other places around town. He said that the burger itself was very salty though. My burger was ok, but nothing super great. I felt like that patty was a little thinner than I was used to. It's honestly hard to compete as a burger joint in the city now when there are already some places doing REALLY good burgers. (Burgatory, Smoke's Burger night, The Vandal, etc) I wouldn't pay $1 extra for the rosemary fries again, they were literally just the same fries my boyfriend got with rosemary flakes sprinkled on them. There were a couple other items on the menu we wanted to try, and it was only their soft opening so we decided we'd be back.  On our second visit, the service was kind of slow. We waited close to 20 min before someone came over to us to ask for our drink orders. When we did get to order, both of us got chicken sandwiches. My boyfriend got a simple grilled chicken sandwich and I got their fried chicken sandwich. He got fries again, I asked for mac & cheese but they were out, so I got a side salad. Since they were out of mac and cheese we decided to try the fried goat cheese bites as an app, I love goat cheese! The goat cheese bites were $9 for 4 little bites, which is a little on the pricer side in my opinion, especially because they weren't that good. When I bit into them they were mostly hollow with some goat cheese attached to the breading on the inside (think a mozzarella stick that the cheese has slipped out of). I only had 1 bite that had much cheese in it. The goat cheese is also herbed goat cheese, which isn't explained on the menu. My boyfriend said his grilled chicken was salty again and it was pickle brined as well, which isn't explained on the menu. He doesn't like pickles. My fried chicken sandwich HUGE, but it was just ok taste-wise, the breading kept slipping off as some other reviewers mentioned. The side salad was ok, the ranch dressing seemed like it was missing something. Overall we found this place to be kind of mediocre so we unfortunately probably won't be back much.",

    "text": "Very disappointed with the burger quality for both myself and my husband. Burgatory, BRGR and even Five Guys offer better made burger. I got the chicken burger, which was very dry. It's understandable that chicken can get dry, but usually with good toppings and sauce this can be covered up. But my burger was dry and the toppings were not enough to balance out the dryness. In addition, it was on the saltier side. However, compare to my husband's overly salted burger, it was not so bad. My husband got the Mexican topping burger. Although the topping and cheese was good, but then burger was sadly over cooked (medium turned into well done). The salt level on his burger was also twice as salty as mine.  Although the service was nice and the place was clean, I am giving it an extra star. But sadly, we will not be going back anytime soon....unless they make some major changes. The price we paid was definitely for gourmet burgers but the quality was not there.",

This place reeks of pittsburgh with the black and gold chairs, toilets, wall art, and menu. Most of there burgers are named after areas in pittsburgh (shadyside, Lawrenceville, strip district...). We bought Lawrenceville (a burger with mayonnaise and a pierogi), and shady side (with honey and other ingredients). Both were amazing, and the fries they came with were great. The staff was friendly, and it was spotless. My favorite part was the restrooms. The toilets and sinks were black and gold. This restaurant dedicates itself to the town.

Hostess and waitstaff were great...friendly, smiling and through chatting were happy to be working there.  Since the tavern license hadn't started yet, we were treated to free Straub draughts.  The menu was, in my opinion, their starting off point.  Besides wild game, beef and chicken, I would like to see maybe a salmon burgher or an open face entree. I opted to build my own burger with potato bun, cheddar, carmelized onions and sauteed mushrooms.  The bun  was great.  I am so sick of those \"brioche\" buns falling apart under the weight of great stuffins.  My burger was prepared to order and came out perfectly.  Now...the fries.  I have lived long enough to have gone through many many incantations of the french fry.  Curly, spicey, puffy bubbled crispy version, etc.  What I got at Burgh'ers was honest to goodness fries which actually tasted like potatoes, crispy, hot and plentiful.  Anyone who knows me always can depend on eating fries from my plate when I am done with my meal.  In this case...fork and knife were up in defense of my fries.  The first time in almost 20 years that I cleaned my plate. The restaurant is new, attractive, friendly staff, great food.  You will be doing yourself a favor to try Burgh'ers.",

If you want to switch the cheese on a burger that you're ordering from the menu, even if the cheeses cost the same on the customized menu, they charge you a dollar extra. Want to trade out one veggie for another? That'll be a dollar too. They even charge 50 cents for putting ketchup on your burger, despite the fact that there are already ketchup bottles on the table! The burgers themselves are pretty mediocre, honestly no better than fast food burgers that you can get for a fifth of the price. And the service is unbearably slow, with orders taking ages even at off-peaks hours of the day. Given the fact that burger places are ubiquitous these days, I seriously recommend staying away from this place and finding somewhere better to eat.",

They offer a variety of signature burgers, but they also provide a build-your-own option which was what I went for. All their burgers come with a side of fries or side salad. I ordered the veggie burger on a lettuce wrap with cream cheese, caramelized onions, cole slaw, and topped with their special sauce which is similar to a thousand island. They offer some unique toppings and yes, I made it my mission to create the weirdest combo which, surprisingly, didn't turn out too bad! Warning for anyone getting cream cheese, they don't just spread it on. They give you a huge slab of it so approach with caution. My biggest complaint is that the veggie patty itself is VERY salty and not as full as others I've had like Burgatory or BRGR. Not very impressed.  I was a huge fan of the restaurant atmosphere. Very open and bright with large windows along the walls. It has a modern industrial vibe with the metal chairs and exposed hvac ducts. Chill and casual for a nice lunch or dinner.  Service was great throughout our visit. The waiters punch in your order as you tell them what you want which makes the process so much more efficient. Anything to get my food faster!",

    "text": "I had really high hopes for this place from the first time I walked by.  Unfortunately it was a let down on multiple fronts.  First, the atmosphere is not at all welcoming.  It feels like a cafeteria inside.  There is very little decor, the floors and walls are just a bright white, there is a lot of open space, and it just has a weird vibe.  It does not set the scene well for a good eating experience.  The bar area did look cool so maybe I would try to sit there if I ever come back.  Onto the food.  Upon looking at the menu I immediately had a bad feeling because the menu says they \"smash\" their burgers.  I am not sure why this would be something you advertise.  I'm hoping by they mean prior to cooking they smash down the uncooked meat, rather than during cooking.   I ordered the Maggie's Farm burger.  I was expecting a high quality burger given fact that burgers are their main focus, as well as the high prices.  What I got was nothing of the sort.  The burger patty is way too small.  If you are going to be selling five guys style burger patties that is fine, and I can enjoy a good thinner burger.  But to charge $13 or more for a thin smashed burger is absurd.  I ordered mine medium rare and it was over cooked.  I'm not sure if this is even the fault of the cook however because I don't know if it's possible to cook such a skinny patty to medium rare.  The burger also did not come out very hot.  The fries were good, as was the homemade ranch dressing.  The overall flavor of the burger was actually good, just not what I was expecting.  It reminded me of Red Robin.  An average piece of beef, but with some very good sauces and toppings.  I just wish they would price their food as such.",

She brought out a macaroni and cheese appetizer that was fierce!  Cheesy, springy, zesty and DELISH!!!!  Our main courses were the shadyside and the polish hill burgers surrounded in a sea of crispy french fries.  My rosemary fries were UNREAL.  The burgers are a thin seasoned patty, topped generously.  Make sure you order a chocolate shake for the trip home...it's made with Millie's local ice cream, you'll thank me later. The bar and tabletops are made from local trees acquired in Butler.  Everything in the whole place is local, from the meat to the toppings to the glasses you drink out of.  Hell, even the bathroom screams Pittsburgh....  FOR EVERYONE ON YELP THAT WANTS A 6 DOLLAR BURGER AND THINKS THAT A POOR REVIEW IS WARRANTED FOR YOUR WALLET BEING UPSET, GO TO EAT N PARK.  I think Hardee's also has a cheap dirty meat wad you can shove down your pie hole.",

    "text": "Um hello delicious, fresh burgers! I've always been curious about this spot and decided to stop in for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. The place was totally deserted which I find crazy now knowing how good their food is. Pro-tip: go on a Tuesday afternoon! You'll get your food super quick and it's a super relaxed atmosphere.   Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and explained that their most popular burgers are all named after neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. They have two sizes of burgers: a craft ($13, regular sized burger) and a mini craft ($10, a little larger than a slider). All burgers come with a side of fries or mixed greens and you can upgrade for $1 for rosemary fries (THE BEST) or $3 for pierogies, mac and cheese, or slaw.   I opted for the Fox Chapel craft burger, which did not disappoint. The patty is their #theblend, which is half local grass fed beef and half sauteed mushrooms. If you like mushrooms, go for #theblend, flavorful but not overpowering. The burger was topped with goat cheese, mixed greens, pickled onion, avocado, and a balsamic reduction. It seems like all their burgers are served on a potato bun, which I didn't love, but it was still tasty.   Now, let's talk about the rosemary fries. These are totally, without a doubt, worth the $1 upgrade. My mom hates French fries but could not get enough of these. Their fries are hand cut, too, which is a score in my book.   Overall, I think this may be my new favorite craft burger spot in the burgh. Love that all their ingredients are fresh, and most even locally sourced. Aka you'll won't feel gross after eating their food. I didn't have a brew, but they have a huge craft beer selection, too.   If you're not in the mood for a heavy, in your face Burgatory burger, definitely hop over to Lawrenceville to Burgh'ers.",

We were seated immediately and the service and food were really good!  We took advantage of the $5 Faber Friday special - the gin is especially good. Love to see local beers and spirits represented on the menu, as well as a few of my favorites central PA ciders - Jack's and Wyndridge Farms.   I got the Morningside burger (again, if you read my reviews, if there's an opportunity to put an egg on a burger, I'm going to take it) and B built his own (basic bitch) burger.  Love the potato roll. The fries (I got the rosemary ones) were fantastic.   I ordered my burger medium rare and the egg over medium. The burger was rare and the egg was over easy. I like both things that way too, so it was no big deal. Thankfully B's burger was well done, as he requested, because he's definitely more particular than I am (as are most people!)  Service was prompt. Dining room was pretty loud, despite not being full. Food was solid. Spent about $50 for two people, two rounds of drinks that were on special. Definitely recommend this place and look forward to getting back myself to try to the macaroni and cheese, chicken sandwich, and a cocktail or two.",

The spot in Lawrenceville is awesome. So very clean and crisp with cute decor. Nice bar area with a few TVs (LOVE the bar stools and how you can adjust their height). Open 7 days a week. They have their own Brew House so house beer on draft, plus others, and then a very extensive bottle list. Menu is quite big with tons of starters, burghers, sandwiches, etc. The Impossible Burger from here is INCREDIBLE. Their sourdough bread is vegan and I can't get enough of the burgher, which you can either customize to your liking with tons of fix-ins, or choose one of the styles they've created on the menu. Burghers come with fries or side salad, and you can upgrade to their rosemary fries which are out of this world amazing! Don't skip out on those, they're unreal! The staff is also SO kind here. Owner's come over to ask how we're liking our food, the girl that works the bar is super friendly, and the hostess are seriously always so perky. Burgher's just won some crazy prestigious James Beard Award for best blended burgher \"The Fox Chapel\" against over 350 restaurants. This place always hits the spot, and I love how they prepared The Impossible Burger, way better than Burgatory.",

First off, I ordered a Mexican War street burger & size of the beef patty is smaller than what is typically served at  burger joints, no worries I have a small appetite.. . Ordered it well done it came out medium well. (huge sigh). Presentation lacked and all the ingredients were sloppily added. Mayo was just a blob, the peppers were huge, throwing it off balance, and the avocado was a tiny smear of green so I couldn't taste it at all. But upon first bite the burger did taste good - no wow factor - but good enough. The beef tasted like quality but greasy, the bun was really soft and good. 3 stars.   The creative nature of this burger in particular was disappointing - no interesting ingredients, no creative elements, lack of craftsmanship. To sum it up this isn't a food lovers place... more like a chill and get a beer place which isn't bad at all. I did order a beer and it was very good, and well priced so I would come back to drink.",

    "text": "Burgh'ers is one part 50's throwback burger joint, one part hipster L'ville eatery, and all parts delicious. I like the fact that they locally source a lot of their ingredients...you really can taste the  difference in quality. On our recent visit, my hubby and I sampled a variety of their offerings. We started with the pierogie appetizer, which included four pierogies each topped with a mountain of caramelized onions. The pierogies themselves appeared to be fried, with a crispy outer shell and a delicious, soft, fluffy filling. They were a perfect pairing with those sweet onions. Were they worth the $10 price tag? Probably not. But still a delicious way to begin our meal.  For dinner, my husband ordered the Maggie's Farm burger, and I decided to indulge with a custom pickle-brined fried chicken sandwich. My husband opted for the standard side of fries that comes with each burger, but being the mac and cheese fiend that I am, I decided to upgrade my side so that I could try theirs (I mean, if I'm going to indulge, I might as well go all in, right?) When my meal came out, I first thought that my waitress had made a mistake and put in my order with double meat, because my sandwich was comprised of TWO fried chicken breasts! But nope, that was not a mistake....their regular chicken sandwiches are just HUGE! And lemme tell you, it was a tasty sandwich! The chicken was super crispy and juicy and had the most delicious salty pickle flavor that stood up well against the rich, creamy cheese and other indulgent accoutrements on my sandwich. So good....and so big that I was able to save one entire chicken breast from the sandwich to take home with me for lunch the next day. As for the mac and cheese side, it was fairly basic, but definitely tasty. A lot of the cheese sauce pooled to the bottom of the bowl, so I had to stir it up with the pasta. The sauce was creamy and well-seasoned, but given that it was an extra $3.00, I'm not sure that it's worth the upcharge, especially considering the fries that come standard with a meal are delicious. Speaking of which....yes, I stole several fries that came with my hubby's burger and they were awesome. I'm not a beef eater, so I didn't try his burger, but he reported that it was cooked exactly as he asked for (medium) and was one of the better burgers that he's had in the 'Burgh.   Yes, it's pricey, but I think the food quality helps to justify the price. On my next visit, I would probably skip the appetizer and the mac and cheese upgrade, which would allow us to get out of there for around $30....very reasonable! We'll certainly be adding Burgh'ers to the ever-growing list of places to get a good burger/sandwich around the area!",

    "text": "I've been wanting to stop in here for the last few months since I go to a hair salon across the street. I finally managed to go on a Thursday afternoon about 2:15pm. Since it was off peak, there were only a few tables with guests & no one at the bar. I sat at the bar since I was alone. I was asked if I had any questions about the beer & didn't realize they brewed their own & had a restaurant (and their brewery) in Zelienople, who knew? They gave me a taste (a rather large taste I might add in these cute tiny Pilsner glasses) of their ale & IPA and both were delicious.   I ordered the Maggie's Farm burger which came with Gouda, horseradish, carmelized onions, roasted chilies & rum aioli. You could really tell that it was a fresh made burger & the horseradish & chilies gave it a good kick. The bun was soft, and the fries were fresh cut & plentiful. They also have rosemary fries for $1 more.   I look forward to visiting their Zelienople location soon & was told they plan to expand to the old Mellon Bank Building on Main St & will eventually have a rooftop deck!  Returned early June: On Thursdays they have $4 house wine by the glass all day. Red is a Merlot, White is a Pinot Grigio. I choose the white & it was a nice dry not too fruity wine that was perfect for 4 bucks. I chose the Fox Chapel which features \"the blend\" which is a combo of beef & mushrooms in the burger, plus goat cheese, greens, onion, avocado & balsamic. It came with a lot of hand cut fries. The burgers remind me of one you'd make yourself at home. Not fancy or huge, but tasty & just enough. It's worth a stop for a burger.   Returned again Oct 25, 2018: Sorry to report that this time I left without ever getting even a drink! Why? I must have been invisible. After giving Burgh'ers 5 stars twice I felt obligated to let management know that even if servers are busy they should always acknowledge a customer's presence. This was an off peak time, 2:15pm on a Thursday. I had 45 minutes to grab lunch before an appointment. I sat at the bar. There were 2 tables & one other couple at the bar. There was a woman who evidently worked there sitting at the bar working on a laptop near kitchen. There was one male server working the bar & tables. Both the woman & man appeared behind the bar twice. But I sat at the bar for 12 minutes. No one made eye contact or acknowledged I was there. Ridiculous. So I left. If this had been my first visit I'd give zero stars. But since I had 2 previously good visits I am just taking one star away & saying Burgh'ers please improve your customer service!",

    "text": "Wow this place has a fantastic happy hour deal! You can try 3 sliders for the price of a normal burger, which gave me the chance to try out several interesting combinations. I particularly like the Fox Chapel Burger and love the way they keep the ground beef patties loosely packed. The draft beer list is also quite extensive, and they had a few fruity beers which my fiancee liked. The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is that I think the burgers are overpriced during non happy hour - - indeed you can get a slightly less inventive yet still solid burger at nearly any bar along this street. Burgh'ers whips up delicious burgers but I would be here more often if they were just a dollar or two cheaper.",

The menu offers an interesting take on burgers, but we would have liked a bit more detail, e.g. what's the #theblend (meat and mushroom patty as our waitress answered when we inquired).  I ordered the Fox Chapel, which has #theblend as well as goat cheese, with balsamic. Hubs ordered the Mexican War. Our burgers were flavorful. As someone who doesn't crave meat, the mushroom mix was appreciated. The Mexican War had chillies in the patty, which offered a nice kick. The food was a decent size and I'm a fan of places that offer side salads in lieu of fries as a no charge option. The buns are very basic potato buns. I'd recommend the restaurant being more adventurous with that.   The draft list has a good bit of options. Hubs got the ESB--fine option for the price. I got the Millennial Marmalade. It was sweeter than I'd like, but should have gathered by its name.",

The burgers are $13 and for $1 you can upgrade your fries to rosemary fries, which is a must!  The food comes out on mismatched china, which I love.  I had the morningside burger which was topped with American cheese, egg, bacon, and mayo and it was delicious!  I was also able to get a Groupon and save some money which made the food taste even better.  I would definitely check Groupon before you go in case there is a deal!  Burgh'ers also brews their own beer, which I haven't tried yet, but I look forward to it on my next visit!  Overall, I think Burgh'ers is a great addition to Lawrenceville!",

The concoction that resembled a 7th grade science experiment gone wrong also was so salty I gagged. My 8-year-old refused to eat the mess. The burgers were ok but the amount of horsey sauce on mine created a near blowout of my nasal cavities. Finally, the RANCH salad dressing was sooooo off. It was basically a peppercorn dressing and my 8-year-old gave it a try and started coughing wildly. I thought she was exaggerating as kids are know too, but then I tasted it and also choking next to her. What a waste of $40. So bummed.",

I had no idea whether or not it was affiliated with the Burgh'ers I had years ago in Harmony, PA but I secretly hoped it was because it was the best burger I ever had. That chance finally came when I saw Burgh'ers listed on the Pittsburgh restaurant week specials.   After much debating I went with the Mexican war burger simply because it was something different and because Good Food Pittsburgh labeled it as one of the top 10 dishes to try for restaurant week. Typically it's not the burger I would have chosen but why not try something new, right?! I was very pleased with my decision. The burger was cooked perfectly and the flavors blended together so well. I was sad to see it slowly disappear.   This is one place I will definitely be visiting again and again. I would highly recommend people try it if they haven't already. As I write this I'm already thinking about when I can go back.",

    "text": "My wife and I went here for dinner on a Friday evening. We had reservations for six since we weren't sure how busy it was going to be. We got there and there were several tables available for walk in which surprised me a bit. Not sure how busy it is typically on a weekend evening, but the reservations were nice to ensure us a table.   We both started with a hazy New England style IPA. I would give it a 3.5 out of 5. There were lots of other beers. Most of them seemed more atypical than what your average brew house would have given burgers being the main staple of the menu.   We also ordered the pickle brined chicken. It was given good reviews on yelp so we gave it a try. It appeared they went with a corn flakes breading. The breading to meat ratio was way out of proportion and the breading didn't adhere to the meat very well. Perhaps it was just a poor dredging process. The pickle was very subtle but you could definitely tell it was brined as it was overly salty. I would give it a 2.5 out of 5.   My wife ordered the shady side and I ordered the Maggie's Farm with fries. Both were very good we thought. Again though it seemed like the patties were overly salted. The freshness and flavor of the other ingredients helped though. We would give the burgers and sides a 4 out of 5.   Lastly, the service was decent. 4 out of 5. I only deduct one star because it took a good 5 to 10 minutes until we were greeted.  After that there were no issues though.  Overall, the entire experience gets a 3.5 out of 5. I really wish that yelp would go to half stars because this place does deserve another half star.  However, it was closer to 3 than 4 for me.",

I thought this was such a cool concept. I'm pretty plain so I went with a bacon, egg and cheese mini burger, and I got a side of cheese sauce and dipped the burger into it. It was so good. I definitely suggest dipping it in the cheese if you're into that. The fries were a treat- super crispy. I was really impressed.",

We both did make your own burgers and didn't realize until our food arrived now small the parties were. It was about the same size as a five guys \"little burger\" but at a higher end burger place price. The fries were pretty good but nothing out of the ordinary.   Our waitress was good and the overall decor was a modern/industrial feel. However, I don't think the food was good enough to get me back here anytime soon.",

    "text": "SOOOO GOOD! I went to try Burgh'ers on a groupon because I was interested in the locally sourced meats and produce. I am generally a 5 guys fan but not really into places like Burgatory. I found this place to be an awesome in between place. The decor is bright modern and industrial. Very bright and clean. I was greeted warmly at the door and directed to the bar.   My order was for takeout and as I waited I was able to take advantage of the $4.00 Faber drinks special. The bartender was very pleasant and very knowledgeable about the drinks and the menu. never having had Faber spirits before he was able to answer my questions about the brand.  I ordered the Fox Chapel and the Maggie's farm burgers on potato bun with added bacon with the standard fries and salad. These burgers were good, very good. I tried them both with #theblend patties which are half beef and half mushroom. The burgers were better than any I've had. Tender and perfectly cooked. The reason that I gave them 4 stars is because even though I paid for bacon and ordered these on potato buns they came out bacon less on brioche. That being said, and I don't think I have ever said this before, I didn't miss the bacon. The burger was so good I didn't even notice the bacon was missing until halfway through. The brioche bun was soft and sweet and perfectly complemented the flavors of the burger. So even though they didn't get it right they got it right.   This is not a cheap burger joint so expect 10 -15 per burger depending on add ons but it is worth it. They have chicken and blt's that I didn't try but turned my head when they came out of the kitchen. They even have the option of wild game meats and fried pierogies.   Groupon is running a few different deals for this place and you should get one. I just bought 2 more and am going back tomorrow. Hope to see you there.",

We went in on a Friday night at 7( I remembers because I happen to have a reminder set up on my phone for 7pm) ordered almost right way. Didn't get our food at 8pm. We looked around, there are some tables, sure, it's Friday but the place was not that packed. I would say 1/3 of the table was empty. So glad we ordered two appetizer, and they came out in a fair amount of time. But our waiter kept apologizing but still can't keep up. Didn't refill our drink for a long time, take him a while to get a beer from the bar etc. two words for the service,  sincere but too slow!  Taste: appetizers were ok, we had the fried chicken and fried goat cheese ball. Fried chicken was too salty for my taste but the rest of the friend liked it. We all think the goat cheese were just ok, average. But burgers were great! I forgot which one did I get, but we had 4 different kinds and every one of them were excellent!",

    "text": "When I see that the food served is locally sourced not only am I delighted with it but I know I have to pay extra for it. This is the 2nd location of this restaurant that has the original in Harmony, PA. I liked the motif with the black and gold chairs perfectly arranged so that each table had at least one of each color.  My waitress was very friendly and helpful in explaining the menu to me. One of the things of note is make sure you ask when ordering because there is an up-charge for most everything whether written or not. For example when I was deciding the type of bun I wanted for my burger I learned that a whole wheat bun would cost $1.00 extra. Most of your sandwiches come with a side of either French Fries or salad with dressing of your choice. If you want cole slaw then it is a $3.00 upcharge along with macaroni and cheese. Those are written on the menu. You can order sides but if you are price wary then make sure to ask before ordering.  In addition to burgers you can order chicken sandwiches, salads,  BLT, or grilled cheese. You have several options when it comes to ordering burgers. You can either order a premade burger from their list or build your own burger. Your additional choices for an upcharge give you the following options: \"the blend\" which means it will have part mushroom filler, \"the double down\" which is about 1/2 pound of ground meat, and \"wild game\" which would be another meat. In today's case it was bison for a $4.00 upcharge. Some of these burgers are can be veggie burgers or have no meat in them whatsoever.  I decided to order the Forest Hills burger which came with blue cheese, sauteed mushroom. mixed greens and honey. I actually didn't have to wait too long for it. The salad side was indeed generous and the burger was cooked just to order and I could taste the freshness in it.  I had the feeling that even though the fries were good I knew I wouldn't be able to finish them.  In addition to milkshakes made with Millie's ice cream, today they were offering ice cream sandwiches. The cost was about $7.00. The ice cream sandwich consisted of two cookies supplied by Mediterra bread and Millie's ice cream as a filler. I was told it would be large enough for two people to share so I decided to pass on it.   Behind me stood the bar with hand crafted brews. At the far end was the chef's prep area. The place was very clean and I was very pleased with my lunch. I am looking forward to trying out their other location in Harmony, Pa when the occasion warrants it.",

I looked up impossible burgers in Pittsburgh to see where it was offered.  I ordered the Strawberry Way beer which was a light and slightly sweet beer. I loved it!  For my meal I ordered an impossible burger on vegan bread with caramelized onions and mustard. I opted for herb fries for an upcharge. My boyfriend ordered an impossible burger with blue cheese, greens, mushrooms, and honey (Forest Hills burger). He also opted for the herb fries.  We both loved our meal! This was my boyfriend's first time trying the impossible burger and he said it was better than real meat. The herb fries were also a huge hit. Highly recommend if you're looking for great burgers and beer in a clean restaurant with friendly service.",

    "text": "I was pleasantly surprised that they actually brewed their own beer on site.  And it was only $4.00 a pint on a Saturday night!  We were feeling like indulging in a burger and a brew and thought what better place to try than here.  When we first arrived we were seated in the dining area, which honestly it's just one big area, but nevertheless it was at a two top table.  I was a little disappointed that our hostess sat us and didn't give us a beer menu or explained how the food menu worked.  We sat for some time.  With no server in site, and minutes ticking by.  I was tired of waiting and got up to see if any seats had opened up at the bar since we arrived.  Sure enough there were a few and I quickly grabbed my stuff and headed to the bar where we were greeted by a great bartender.  He promptly took our drink order.      They had a pretty decent N.E. IPA on tap, and at the $4.00 price tag, it was a definite score.  Next we ordered our burgers.  I was in between three options, Maggie's Farm, Fox Chapel, and the Animal.  The animal caught my eye with the addition of basil and jalapeno.  It also came with cream cheese and tomato.  You can get fries or a mixed greens salad for which I chose the latter.  My other half chose the Maggie's Farm burger and fries.  When our food came out I couldn't help but notice the slice of cream cheese on top of my burger.  It was massively cut, terribly excessive and such a waste.  I smeared off 97% of it.   After the cheese was under control the burger tasted very fresh but the toppings didn't bring as much flavor to the party as I thought they would.  On the contrary, I tried the Maggie's Farm burger and wished I had went that route.  It had a nice spicy kick to it.  Mine was good, but the cold, thick cream cheese wasn't the best topping for this burger.      One thing we noticed as the time ticked closer to closing time is that people were still coming in, were still ordering food, and still getting drinks.  I think the 10 pm closing time is merely a suggestion.  Overall the bar experience was very nice and the burger was good though the execution of the burger fell a little short.",

We were expecting that with their burgers but we didn't know they brew their own beer too.  That was a pleasant surprise.         We walked in on a Saturday evening and it was busy but we got a table for two.  We wanted to go to the bar but it was full.  We waited at our table for five minutes and nobody stopped by to get us drinks or to greet us.  We saw some spots open at the bar so we just left our table and sat at the bar.  They were busy but somebody still could have greeted us.  The bar was much better.  There was a TV and the bartender was good.  He was busy but we got service.  He told us about their beer and we got to look over the menu's.  I went with Maggie's farm burger cooked medium.  My wife ordered the Animal.          The beer that we ordered was a New England Ipa and it was good.  That night they were on special for $4 which was great.  You rarely see something like that.  Our food came out and I really enjoyed my burger.  It wasn't a big burger like I was thinking it would be but it still was a good size.  My wife didn't like her burger as much.  It came with cream cheese on it like she wanted but it was a huge slab.  It should have been thinner and probably more melted because it came cold.  The meat was good just need to fix the dressing I'd say on the whole burger.  I didn't ask for lettuce and tomatoes but it probably could have used that.   Overall we had a good time here and I would come back.  I do recommend trying this place if you want a good burger and really good local craft beer.",

    "text": "This was part of a brewery tour my boyfriend and I did. We hadn't even heard of this place until a few weeks before. A burger joint that started making beers? Why not. We went expecting to see mostly basic styles and nothing to stand out. It was easily the best beers of the day.  We hit the spot up during happy hour. There was a fair number of people at the bar but not many at the tables. It was a Wednesday. The bartenders were on top of it. Service was prompt and they noticed and refilled water glasses.  We ordered some French fries to munch on with our beers. They are half off for happy hour. We ordered the rosemary fries for something different. If you are a fan of rosemary go for it. The fries were crisp and flavorful and there was a lot of rosemary.  We ordered a flight of four beers to try a variety.  Belgian Block - This golden ale was delicious. The banana notes really come through. This is smooth and easy drinking. It drinks easier than the ABV suggests. I would definitely drink this, especially on a hot day when I want a lighter style.  Grand Duchy - This was a solid porter. I always am skeptical when I see cherry in the description since I have found it to be a tricky ingredient in beer. This was my least favorite of the flight. However, I think that says more about the other beers than this one.  Oat Black Water - This is a very good stout. I do tend to go for dark beers. It was smooth and had great roasted notes.  Oat Black Water Barrel Reserve - Easily the best beer. You still get all the roasty flavors of the original, but the aging with maple kicks up the sweetness and brings out the chocolate notes more. You definitely pick up the notes from the barrel.  Overall this was four solid beers and a good experience. I'm not sure how often they change styles but I will check the list to see what new ones they come up with. Although I would go back and drink any of the four I had today.",

The service was great; very fast, friendly and attentive which always makes for an enjoyable experience.  Our server had another sever in training and she did a great job!  We started with the fried goat cheese bites. They were so good and melted in your mouth! I had a beer (White Lightning) and my BF had a Dark and Stormy. Their beers they brew were all $1 off, which was cool. I had a \"Liberty\" burger which was a cheeseburger with a special sauce and a side salad. Delicious! You can tell this is organic beef and I love farm to table and locally sourced restaurants! We also shared hand-cut french fries with rosemary, which was a nice flavoring. Well done, Burgh'ers!",

It was pretty slow and empty at the time around 1pm in the afternoon on a Tuesday. I have to say that my favorite thing about this place was 'The Toilet Paper' on the bathroom stalls. It's a one-page newsletter of happenings and facts pertaining to the restaurant. So while you're doing your business, you can read. I ordered the burger slide with chili cheese fries and my friend the Shadyside burger with cheese fries. We both enjoyed our meals. My chili cheese fries kind of overtook my plate. The cheese and chili are rather thin and therefore flood the plate. Nonetheless, very good and flavorful along with the burger. I built my own little burger and very much enjoyed it. I can't say that I wouldn't or won't come back, but I won't be in a hurry.",

    "text": "This place has been on my radar for some time now.  I have heard people talk of it for a long time just making my wait that much longer.  It's like when you want something, but you just can't have it and having it rubbed in your face.  I like this place and the way it looks.  It's sleek, and minimal.  Nothing flashy about it, so modern like.  The day that I came here it must have been between busy hours which afforded us the chance to just walk in and sit wherever we wanted.  We chose the bar which made for quick service all around.    The menu is straightforward.  You basically pick what you want, the description is point on which leaves nothing to be questioned.  Which is probably why I had a hard time deciding exactly what I wanted.  But I did end up making a good decision.  I went with the Morningside Burger, that's another thing to love about this place, all the burgers are named after the many different neighborhoods in the city.  More of a play on words than the neighborhood, the Morningside Burger is basically what it sounds like.  Plain and simple, bacon, egg and cheese.  Add some mayo and you got yourself a pretty amazing burger.  A perfectly smashed burger, seasoned so well and when those toppings are there, it's amazing.  A tip if you do get this, go with the dippy egg.  When that yolk breaks you get a little extra added bonus.    As for the side, just go with the fries.  There are other sides you can get, but they won't be like these fries.  Pierogies, mac n cheese, rosemary fries, slaw, mixed greens salad; push them all to the side and go with the fries.  They are definitely hand cut.  No two fries are alike as they are cut literally by hand.  You may get a small fry but the next one may look like a steak fry.  Reminds me of doing something like that at home.    And who could pass up a cold one with this meal?  Not I.  I had the 1890 draft.  This thing tasted so light to me.  Smooth and easy going.  Coming from nearby Zelienople it is a house brewed beer.    One thing to also note here is that they do deliver, with a small fee.",

There were very little chiles (maybe 1.5 small pieces) - the bites that included them were definitely better than without. The patties aren't very thick, which I wasn't a fan of. Of course, I had to get a milkshake. I got a simple chocolate shake and I was pretty disappointed. I paid $7 and it tasted the same (if not worse) as a McDonald's shake. NOT worth the price at all. I also tried the rosemary fries, and they were decent - very little rosemary was pathetically sprinkled on top. Overall, the burgers are okay, the shakes aren't worth it, and the fries are overrated. It's still a good place to try, but I don't think I'll be going back.",

Usually you can sort of identify the taste or concept they are going for, but rarely does it actually amount to something great. In this case it was perfect. I had the fox chapel burger and the flavor profiles were absolutely amazing. Even the salad was excellent. Although a little pricey, it is well worth it for the level of burger craft that goes on here, easily my favorite burger in Pittsburgh in terms of flavor. The beers were also excellent and reasonably priced, I will definitely be back to try more Burgh'ers soon!",

We have passed by here multiple times on our way over to Lawrenceville. We decided to stop over because of all the great reviews we read.   We started with a Strawberry milkshake and it was DELICIOUS. It just might be the best milkshake I've ever tasted. My only critique is I wish it could have been thicker.   We got the pickle brined chicken for an appetizer. Both my fiance and I loved this dish. We were very interested that the chicken was soaked in pickle juice. It was so moist and it melted in your mouth. It came with rum sauce (sounds weird) it was basically heaven. It's very hard to describe. Just take my word and try it!   Both burgers were fantastic. So much flavor and were cooked to perfection. The Polish Hill burger was what my fiance got and she loved it. A pierogi on a burger? Say no more, just order it. You won't be disappointed.   If you're like me and love burgers, this place just might become your new favorite burger spot in Pittsburgh.",

They make fantastic burgers; although for the price, they could be a little larger (we always had the same complaint about the Harmony location). You must pair your burger with the shoestring fries. Home run right there. Although the salad with the honey vinaigrette is also a solid pick.   Service was solid and the food arrived quickly.

Anyways, the burger was very good. Full of flavor. The salad was good as well. The portion was perfect and I was full by the end. I will say the price is high for what you get. I understood I was getting a small burger, but for only two dollars less than the regular size one, I felt a little jipped. Overall, a good place to add to the rotation and I'm sure I'll be back.",

Hubby, son & I had each gotten make your own burgers with the cheese fries as side & a chocolate milkshake. The shake was delicious, a little in the higher priced side but the shakes taste made the $7 well worth it. The burghers were cooked perfectly. Do not be deterred by how the cheese fries looked, the sauce looked bland & runny but was a little bit spicy & delicious. If there was one thing I had to say that was out of the norm it was the antique plates they serve the food on, in a more modern restaurant I found that odd. I will say that if the plates are the only thing I can complain about though, Burghers is a go!",

I've never had honey on my burger before but it was completely done correctly. The side salad of mixed greens was also fresh and tasty. My friend had the pickle chicken and that blew my mind as well, unbelievably good. Never had it before then. Report of my friend is that the house beer was pretty good and the stout she tried (there are many) was surprisingly tasty. Definitely seems like an amazing place for a good beer just from looking around. The biggest downside of this place is the volume, literally it's hard to hear yourself think, so this really isn't a good spot for a date or even really catching up with friends butttt if you want a stiff drink with a novel \"burgers by neighborhood\" theme in a fun space with friendly and attentive staff, then this place is worth checking out!",

Luckily, my meal at Burghers did not fall into that same sad category!   I went with the Fox Chapel. The burger was a blend of beef and mushrooms, topped with goat cheese, greens, balsamic vinaigrette, pickled onion and avocado. I added a fried egg on top because I can't eat a burger without it.   They serve their patties in a \"smash burger\" style where they come out pretty thin. I was worried that would automatically translate to the meat being overcooked but was pleasantly surprised that my medium rare order still had pink!  I went for a side of Mac and cheese instead of fries. It wasn't that hot when it came out, but the flavor was great and the noodles were still a little al dente, which I love. I'd try it again. I also tried a bite of my friend's fried chicken sandwich and liked it a lot.   Our server, Bridget, was wonderful. Friendly, polite and easily answered all of our menu questions.   Note: it's BYOB for now but they should be getting their liquor license shortly! There is a great bar space with the potential for a huge draft list. I'll be back once that happens!",

Another overpriced / underwhelming burger joint jumping on the burger-craze train. The staff was all very nice. The food is all over priced, especially for the portion size. $13 for their standard burger. The guy next to me got his burger while I waited for mine, and I just assumed he bought the smaller $10 size burger. Well, you know what they say about assuming... The burger patty was pretty small and flat, but it was seasoned well. Nothing like you would expect for the price. Similar sized to a single patty at Five Guys.  The restaurant also feels cold and lifeless. Not warm and welcoming at all. And with the concrete ceilings and no sound absorbing materials, it was very loud even with the small amount of people there at the time. Save your money and go to Five Guys instead.",

As another reviewer stated, they have delicious local and organic burgers, many named after Pittsburgh's neighborhoods, milkshakes crafted from Millie's ice cream (that are absolutely to die for) and much more.   We arrived hungry and shared a Mexican War and Morningside. Both burgers were outstanding, yet the Morningside particularly was over salted and perhaps could use a hint of something sweet to offset the salt within the patty, bacon and egg. The Mexican War was my favorite as all of the flavors melted in your mouth and had the right amount of spice after each bite. The rosemary and regular fries were also tasty but again suffered from too much salt.  We left pleasantly full and it's safe to say this is my favorite burger eatery in Pittsburgh by far! Simple, fresh and not-overstated decor meets great food with speedy and attentive service. We will definitely return and try something new--hopefully the beer too!",

This new location in Lawrenceville, brings delicious farm-to-table burgers into the city.  This location is in a brand new building, and has a modern look, with a little bit of Pittsburgh flair to include black & gold seating.  Today was the first day of their soft opening to the public.  Most of the burgers on the menu are named after Pittsburgh neighborhoods (They do have some other items on the menu that are not burgers also).  Today I enjoyed a \"Bloomfied\" burger, which has Swiss crisp sauteed greens, caramelized onions, fennel, mayo, and pepper flakes, and a side of fresh-cut fries.  The service was fast and friendly, and owner Chef Fiore even came out to ask me how everything was . . . it was excellent.  Look forward to coming back again, especially after they complete their liquor license so I can have a craft beer to go along with my burger.",

    "text": "We were excited to try this place but had a disappointing outcome unfortunately.   We ordered chocolate and mocha shakes which were yummy. Plus the goat cheese balls were delicious. My husband also liked the pickle brined fried chicken sandwich.But the rest was just eh.   I ordered the Liberty burger at medium but it was well done. If you're going to be a burger joint then how can you get that wrong? The secret sauce on it was so bland and I was so excited to try it!  My friend ordered a custom burger and they forgot his sauce. Another friend ordered a sandwhich and it didn't come out as how ordered either. I don't know if they are still just getting used to things including their ordering app but hopefully they get it together.  The burgers are small for the price. Our bill was about $50 incl. tip for two and that didn't even include alcohol!  I don't see us going back.",

I had the Shadyside burger and ordered it medium well - I think it was a little more cooked than I prefer it, so next time I'll get it medium. The burger itself was well seasoned and the toppings were perfect. Their grilled mushrooms are especially delicious! I had regular fries with my burger and they were nice and crispy. Definitely will be back again!",

It seemed to lack proper seasoning. I ordered cheese fries and they weren't really hot and were just covered in cheese goo. My wife got the pickle brined fried chicken sandwich and the breading just kinda fell off. The bill came to $16 for a burger and fries. I don't think I'll be back.",

    "text": "This place is really meh. I expected a lot more. The food is decent, though definitely not on the Burgatory/BRGR level at all. I can't really complain, decent service as well. But the real hook is: The food is TINY, the burger patties are like 4 ounces. And the sides are all tiny as well. And the prices are insanely high for those tiny sides/burgers. It's just completely not worth it. 2 people with 2 burger meals and a single appetizer should not cost upwards of $60.   We have sooooo many better options around the burgh. I suggest stopping in once but repeats are just a drain on the wallet. Go to Burgatory, BRGR, 5 Guys, Wahlburgers, Stack'd... all better value and better tasting.",
