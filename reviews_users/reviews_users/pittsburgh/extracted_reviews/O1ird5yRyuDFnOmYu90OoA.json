On a nice day, there are three distinct spaces you can be- the bar, the back room, or the patio. All are pleasant, though my fave is the cool darkness of the back room. I've been here many times and the food has always been good, and the service prompt. When its earlier in the evening, and not too packed, it's a great place for a chill conversation, and a cold margarita. It's lawrenceville, so be prepared for a dicey parking situation.",

    "text": "Our friends suggested this cool cantina after our initial Irish choice in the Strip was found to be full of raucous religious folk doing a fundraiser.  Thank goodness for that, as this place was infinitely cooler and more interesting than the other, and the food was very authentic Mexican and a great deal.  After a slog through the main bar (dark and cool and hip without being grotesque) we made it to the back room with the ginormous t.v. We ordered chips, guacamole, salsa and seitan tacos. The seitan was braised and cut to mimic carne asada, and was almost totally spot-on, minus the greasy mouth feel that pork leaves you with. Our friend had the pork belly tacos, which he polished off in minutes, before we could even get a good look. He's a sous chef in fine dining so he knows good food, and he proclaimed his tacos to be outstanding.  The salsa was spicy enough to make itself known but not too hot as to damage your mouth. The guacamole was PERFECT, like mamasita would make, on the chunky side with real avocado and onions and spices.  I don't drink much so I ordered the Shan Diego, a mix of lemonade and IPA. It was refreshing and light, and perfect with the food. Unfortunately my sis ordered sangria and didn't care for it, so she took my drink and I ended up with her cherry Kool-Aid sangria, which was a bit of travesty and probably shouldn't be called that.  The service was excellent, friendly and constant, and we felt super welcome. Love the vibe of the entire place, it's right on.",

A Saturday night where the weather is warm and the night sky clear is best spent on the Cantina's back patio. It's gushing with life. The drinks are excellent (I like when I can find a real margarita that's not some artificial \"ultimate margarita\" that always seems to disappoint. They have a great selection of tasty tacos too. You might think it strange to find a spot that makes you feel this close to actually being in Mexico, but you'll be having too good a time to care!",

Hipsters should understand the notion of eating every last broken chip and letting nothing go to waste. The two tacos you get are tiny for the price, but they have a lot of flavor. Just make sure you eat something beforehand or else splurge on four tacos. La Esposa margarita was good but also pricey. I wasn't asked if I wanted salt on the rim, but my friend who got a plain margarita got salt on his. Overall, it wasn't a bad experience but I've had more successful experiences at other similar restaurants so I'll probably stick to those.",

That being said, five times in a row I've woken up the next day with insane diarrhea from the tacos. I'm talking volcanic liquid fire, the type that leveled Pompeii, pouring from my butt. It doesn't even make sense how much comes out compared to what I actually consumed.  DO NOT EAT THE TACOS.  Do not eat anything there just to be safe.  At first  and second I thought it was just me then I thought it was the maragarita mix, so I avoided that to no avail. Then another half-off taco monday rolled around and my friends coaxed me back, but Tuesday I was late for work from the round corner cantina anal destruction. Then a friend said the seitan tacos gave her the same thing. So I only ordered the tofu tacos next time (several months later). That was last night. I woke up at 7:30a today and haven't left my bedroom/bathroom trail for 3 hours. NEVER AGAIN. (I've said this before.)  My suggestions include to Cantina: 1) give Imodium with the tacos (maybe sprinkle it on top crumbled like queso fresco) 2) market the tacos as a 12 hour weight loss program 3) include diarrhea warnings on the menu next to the tofu and seitan tacos    (I've never had the others, but my friend said the chicken does the same thing to her)  This is my own fault for going back, giving into peer pressure like an after school special, and wanting tacos but being too lazy to go somewhere else or just make them.",

Cons:  The service isn't the best as far as responsiveness to drinks, taking food orders properly, and checking in to see if we wanted anything else.  Also, the queso fundido is a joke.  Don't order it, especially if you're expecting real queso fundido!  I also had the chorizo tacos.   Not bad, however not great either.  The real con of this place is the food made me sick!  I lived in Mexico, and not once did I ever experience the punishing after effects of food like this place gave me.    Surprisingly, I would go back to this place.

    "text": "Such a disappointment. When my girlfriend and I stopped there for drinks it wasn't chaotic and the food smelled fantastic. When our party of six went for a late dinner (9pm) it was one of the least enjoyable dining experiences I've had in Pittsburgh.   We wanted to eat on the patio, which we quickly figured out was 'seat yourself'. This is where it turned into The Hunger Games. Everyone standing around hawkishly waiting for a table. You make some friends and alliances to get the job done, survive and get a table. While we waited in the middle of this half open air Thunderdome I made my way to the bar to grab a libation. This might be how they keep you busy. The seemingly infinitely patient couple in front of me and I waited for a solid ten minutes before...well whatever the hell was going on was situated and we were asked for our order. Just to stretch my legs, another 5 minutes for 2 sangria, which I will say that both the red and the white are fantastic. I digress.   We finally won the pity of a family from District 1 who made sure to tell us they were leaving to show their commitment to bestow upon us they're semi-primo series of three small tables pushed together saving us from having to shoulder block the 2 middle aged woman to my right from swooping in to protect the Cornucopia. Tables.   Then the hunt for 2 more chairs was on. This is the point in the final few minutes of \"The Games\" where you expect all the kids to turn on each other. We made enemies. We made friends. You never know how good a person really is till times are dire and you need their help. Our party was complete. Pressed in together snugly on three sides of the tables haphazardly pressed up against the rail (one of the long sides mind you) while the \"DON'T MOVE THE FURNITURE\" sign daunted overhead.   We've sat. We've ordered. War is hell. Really enjoyed that first half hour.   Now I'm excited. The guacamole and salsa are both so amazing they may have been touched by Guy Feiri's frosted tips and blessed by Pope Frank on their way out if the kitchen. Maybe the fight is part of the experience Makes you tougher. Makes you hard. Maybe this is going to be an experience where I learn this lesson that changes my current course of life by telling me that patience pays off and the fish tacos I ordered will send my brain into a slow-motion running, shit blowing up in the background scene from a Michael Bay movie frenzy.   Sadly, no. The fish taco was as greasy as my soul and the bill was higher than my blood pressure on that day last week where I couldn't find a parking spot in the casino garage. The casino parking garage. Someone has to be working against you to have that kinda frustration.   Can that dude with the truck open somewhere with seats please?",

I should mention the food was FANTASTIC... but we had to ask for everything, like salt, pepper, silverware, cream, sugar... and the waitress seemed to be burdened by the fact that we were asking (and in some cases, needed to ask again). There was a male waiter though who was very pleasant and helpful when he came over.   I realize this is not a fancy place and is going for more of the hipster vibe (it's obvious)... and I'm not one to hate on hipsters... and that's not the point. Wait staff, no matter the vibe of the place... should be paying closer attention to customers' needs to ensure a pleasant experience, and less on rolling silverware and catching up with one another.   Also the tall chick tending bar in the front ALWAYS has a nasty attitude when I ask her anything. Generally with any females I've ever been to the bar with, too. Not sure what she's like to guys.... either way, it's really a bad reflection of the place. But I have no complaints about the drinks...  FOOD - order the churros... and the chilaquiles for breakfast are amazingly delicious. the tacos aren't that great, though. the quesadillas are good but nothing to write home about.",

The front bar also has a really cool vibe to it, and the back room is good for large groups and dinner.  The food here is really actually very good! I used to just come here for drinks, but the brunch menu is to die for, and the dinner and late-night food is notable as well. Very vego friendly, with veggie taco options and other snacks and sides, all which are worth trying at some point. The red salsa that comes with chips is super sweet and spicy, but the guacamole is my favourite to go with a meal or as a snack. For a while there, my friends and I were Cantina guac addicts.  The drinks are cheap, especially for a place with as nice an atmosphere as Cantina. The margarita menu has everything you could ever dream of at a Mexican bar, and I've tried them all. The El Camino and the strawberry one are my favourite. The beers are also cheap, with lots of local and Mexican selections available. They have micheladas, too, but I have yet to try them because I can't seem to stop ordering margaritas here even when I try to tell myself to order something new.  Thursday karaoke night is worth checking out. You don't have to sing, just go and enjoy it. There are mad drink specials that night, too.",

    "text": "I hate writing a critical review of Round Corner because I love the vibe of the place, and the drinks are actually really good. Plus, the owner is a nice guy. Unfortunately, the food just doesn't do it for me, and that's the most important aspect.  Of all of the things that I've tried in the handful of times that I've eaten there, I'd say the tamales are the best thing on the menu. They're truly delicious, and the sole thing that I think about when Round Corner is mentioned. The pico and chips are also good. The pico has a real freshness about it, but that's hardly a unique thing to pull off.   The part that keeps my review of Round Corner from being a totally positive one is the tacos. The first area where the tacos fail - quite literally - is the corn tortillas. I'm impartial on their use of corn over flour tortillas, but the fact that the they use TWO tortillas for each taco and they STILL fall apart almost immediately when you try to pick up your taco is ridiculous. The flavors in the tacos are fairly pedestrian and almost monotonous, but I can't stand being required to use a fork to eat a taco. On the plus side, they're fairly affordable (2 tacos for about $7), but if taco stand/truck-quality tacos are what you're craving you can still enjoy tastier tacos for less from one of those options.  Will I go back? Sure. My complaints aren't deal breakers, by any means, but Round Corner is hardly my first choice when I'm in a taco/mexican food kind of mood.",

Sorry we don't dress like you, but that is no excuse for the amount of shade thrown our way.  Regardless, we pressed on hoping that maybe the food is good in addition to  the service from our waiter/waitress. OH HOW WRONG WE WERE.   So we get onto the patio (which is beautiful by the way, probably one of its only redeeming qualities) and after about 10 or so minutes we finally find a table BUT NO CHAIRS. No waiter/waitress was in sight! 2 of my girlfriends had to locate chairs on our own throughout the patio and place them at our table. Call me old-fashioned but shouldn't restaurant tables have ya know, chairs?!  Anyway, we finally seated ourselves and waited for the waitress to take our orders. And waited. And waited. And waited. Finally she came over to our table and took our orders. She was pleasant enough so we had high hopes for our meal. Again, our meals took a very long time to come to us. I ordered the tortilla espanola which is supposed to be filled with potatoes, egg, etc. I swear it only had like 5 pieces of potato in it. One of the reasons why I got this dish was BECAUSE OF THE POTATOES! The menu description even said it had potatoes! SO WHERE ARE MY POTATOES?!  But I digress.   We finished our meals and were ready to pay, but it took the waitress about 20 minutes to come get our checks. Unacceptable.   Overall, I won't be going back there any time soon. Maybe they were having a bad morning, who knows? Regardless, the food was meh and the service was meh. The prices were too high for the amount of meh. As far as brunches go, I wouldn't recommend this place. At all.",

Service was superb, and the waiter even suggested I try El Yucateco's \"black\" hot sauce, which complimented my carne asada + chorizo based burrito nicely w/ its distinctive smokey heat. Back to food...besides burritos there are plenty of taco options, so consider ordering 2 or 3 types to add to your fiesta -- the shrimp one was not what I expected though. If you're still not full, go for the rolled potato tacos which don't disappoint. The outdoor patio is a bonus, especially if you score a seat out of the direct sunlight on a hot summer day.",

I met a friend around 9pm on a Thursday night thinking we would have no problem with crowds.  Big mistake.  After squeezing my car into the last open parking spot within a 5 block radius, we made our way inside.  The place was packed.  I was hoping to lounge outside, enjoy a few drinks and the lovely weather, catch up on current events....it was not to be.  Instead we settled for one of the last tables inside.  The service, while not the quickest, wasn't a complete disappointment considering how busy the place was.  The chips and salsa were some of the best I've ever had - which they should be for the price.  We also ordered tacos - my friend got the mahi mahi tacos, I the hanger steak tacos.  $7.50 for just two tacos seemed a little steep, but they were darn good.  The beer and cocktail menu has lots of options.  One of our biggest likes was the music - lots of great songs I hadn't heard in awhile.  I don't know that I was necessarily impressed with my whole Round Corner Cantina adventure, but I will probably be back.  Just not when I'm in a hurry.",

Their margarita is a bit non-standard, with a hefty dose of orange juice mixed in.  They do mention this on the menu, though.  Overall, I think Verde's margaritas are much better and more authentic.  I appreciate that they almost always have Green Flash's West Coast IPA on tap.  Nowadays, that is pretty much all that I drink here.  Their specialty cocktail menu is a bit hit or miss -- their mojitos are decent, and I like the unique taste of the Red Pepper Red Pepper (though it can be inconsistent, depending on who is bartending).  There is a nice selection of upscale tequilas for those who are really into tequila and have the moolah to blow $20-40 on a shot.  The best thing about Round Corner is their outdoor space. The back patio is expansive and gorgeous, a big draw when the weather is nice out.  It's a great place for big groups and parties.  I also appreciate their new-ish fold-down tables out front.  We'll sit there to hang out with our dog, eat some tacos, and do some people watching.",

    "text": "I gave this place 4 stars because it is the best Mexican food I have had in Pittsburgh.   The service is very good considering the volume of customers they cater to and the atmosphere/environment is very appropriate.  Where I feel they fall short, is their limited menu.  I understand that it is a very casual restaurant-- it feels like it is intended to be a great place to go to meet friends after work or on a weekend night to grab a drink and get a *quick* bite to eat. Round Corner has the potential to be so much more... and Diners recognize that. Instead of getting a quick bite to eat with their drinks, they end up going there just for the food, or they end up making a night of it and hand out there for long hours.  They have and enormous back patio and it is awesome to sit back their on summer nights.  So I guess that is my complaint: \"You Could be so much more 'Round Corner'!\" Expand the menu, focus just as much on the food as on the drinks, don't approach diner's as if they are their just to be at a bar (I go there to get food all of the time, and skip the drink). In terms of what I have enjoyed on their menu... 5 Stars for each of the following: The Salsa, Guacamole, Beef Birria Tacos, Lamb Barbacoa Rolled Tacos, Pescado Tacos. 4.5 Stars for the following: Potato Rolled Tacos, Pollo Pibil Tacos",

    "text": "I know there are some people here that are gonna disagree with this review, but I'm just not a big fan of this place.  Their drinks are expensive, the wait staff does not put a lot of effort in making the customer happy (in my experience) and it's tough to grab their attention.  Plus I thought the food is overall about average in my opinion.  I expected more from this place, especially after having read some of the glowing reviews on here.  Went here for the first time about 6 or 7 months ago on a mini bar crawl of sorts and had a round of tequila shots with two friends.  I can't recall the tequila we had but it wasn't particularly tasty.  I think we paid $7 per shot, which was a bit higher than I was anticipating.  We all got kind of a cold vibe from the bartender and later discussed this fact amongst ourselves.  We payed for the shots and bounced within 5 minutes of being there.  About the interior - the indoor bar area was pretty dimly lit (it was around 9 or so from what I recall) and the small bar hangout area had a bunch of hipster-esque folks lingering about amongst themselves in little clusters.  The next time I went here was about 6 weeks ago with a larger group of friends.  I was really hoping to like this place on the second go-around, which was on a Tuesday evening for happy hour.  Their special is $4 margaritas and $4 sangrias, plus $1 off beers.  The margs were served in a mason jar, which sounds cool, but they are some TINY mason jars.  $4 seems maybe an average price for the serving size you get in my opinion.  And the quality of margarita was nothing particularly special either (I got mine on the rocks).  It just seemed bland, and not particularly strong.  I ordered a set of fish tacos (they were half off I believe?) as well, and they were decent but nothing special.  Nothing like what I remember sampling in coastal Baja California Sur (but then again I'm not sure what RCC is trying to emulate here).  Also got a Tijuana street dog which WAS in fact decent.  I mean it's tough to mess up a hot dog, and add some jalapenos, some avocado, bacon, crema, etc. and you've generally got yourself a party!  The chips were also decent and still warm, though I was not a huge fan of their salsa.  I'm tough to please with Mexican food.  I'll blame it on all those Mexican vacations...  I swear I'm gonna give this place one more shot - third time's a charm, right?  I'll try ordering some different entrees and maybe try some different drinks.  And also try their outdoor seating area.  Until this happens, I'm only giving this place a generous three stars for not living up to the hype to date.  I'd like to think they are closer to 2.75/5.",

    "text": "Despite the Cantina's quaint atmosphere, service is HORRIBLE.  In fact, let me be more specific. The owner (middle aged small blond woman) is horrible.   I have been to the Cantina many times and always had good food and drinks. This time, my husband and I ordered two mojitos. The mojitos were flat (absolutely no taste) with not a trace of alcohol. It was clear something was wrong.  We passed the drinks around...had our friends confirm that it wasn't right and thus informed our server.  [BTW, we were very courteous when we informed our server---most of us have been servers at one point in our lives and we know that things happen---we did not think this was a big deal...that is until we met 'bar manager-owner'.]  The server explained she would tell the 'bar manager'.  She didn't offer to take our drinks away or apologize or even act inquisitive about why they might be tasting bad. About 10 minutes later, the 'bar manager' came out and without introductions or any lead in, just immediately went into a monologue (with lots of hostility) to our friend about how she was the 'bar manager' and owner and she personally had made our drinks and followed a very specific recipe.  I redirected her to my husband and I, since it was our drinks and she continued to be defensive. We did not get one word in. My friend said that perhaps we could just switch out the drinks and the 'bar manager-owner' explained that we would still be charged for these mojitos. There wasn't an ounce of 'apology' in either her or our servers' behavior and triad.  The owner took our drinks and we were never asked again whether we wanted another drink. Our server seemed clueless that her behavior was bad and never tried to make up for it.  It was too bad that we had already ordered about $75 worth of food for our party...or we would have left.  The owner must think that the quaint atmosphere will make up for their horrible service. Sorry...not for this party.  I would think twice about going there.",

One would feel more welcome entering a concentration camp. If owner would re staff with happy and competent people it could be a real winner as the location is cute.",

As a guy who really appreciates good ingredients and a well-crafted mixed drink, this place doesn't disappoint at all.  Service is...ok.  My experiences have been pretty underwhelming so far, but the rest of the bar makes up for it for the most part. Unfortunately, I haven't tried the food here yet, but I've heard good things.

    "text": "Sure, the outdoor seating is quite pleasant when the climate agrees. Absolutely, the seitan tacos are a great substitution to a carnivore diet (this coming from a near meatatarian). Undoubtedly, their combination of brunch and mexican cuisines is tasty and filling. Remarkably, their salsas/sauces/guac are all fresh, delicious, and worth licking the bowl for the last bits.  But the real reason I'll go back? The booze.  I know what you're thinking - that pseudo-alcoholic from the Midwest is at it again, overlooking what really makes a place great and just going straight for the bottle. But this place is for real. I enjoyed a bloody mary during a Sunday brunch that not only cured a hangover but almost paved the road for the start of a second hangover. My brunch mate slurped down a mojito of sorts that flavorful and strong, much to her delight. Despite the strength of said potions, they were still quite tasty. My only complaint is that I couldn't slog mine down fast enough to enjoy it ice cold in its entirety. I have also enjoyed some sort of spicy martini, another non-spicy martini, and something involving fruit and tequila - while I apologize for not remembering the specifics (see: sentence #1 of this paragraph), I will assure you that everything was enjoyable and strong enough to make a bull lose balance.  The only complaint I have about this place is that it seems slightly overpriced. I know it is the only decent place of its kind in the area, but their prices signify that they also know it and are using it to their advantage. Also, the vibe can border on the pretentious depending on the crowd, but I would say in general from my visits and peer-ins from the street that the crowd isn't much of a worry.   Overall, and this kind of goes without saying, I'll be back. What can I say - some of us love the sauce, whichever variety it may be.",

    "text": "I don't even like seitan, or tacos really, but I sometimes find myself craving Round Corner's seitan tacos. Ample cilantro and lime make them super tasty and radish adds nice color and crunch. I love the double tortilla method which keeps the experience pretty neat-- I usually avoid tacos because they get messy, but these are manageable. The salsas that I have tried in the past have been terrible though, so the kitchen is a one trick pony when it comes to vegan options. The bartenders make great Pimms' cups (with cucumber!) and I really like the Carnation cocktail. The atmosphere of the bar is cool, the music is usually interesting and the back patio is to die for. Seriously, getting a table on the patio can be cut-throat, as seating is first come first serve (or a competition of attention and aggression) and is not managed by staff. I find the situation to be stressful. You usually have to sit down before the servers even clear/clean the table (which makes me feel like an asshole), otherwise you'll lose it. It's kind of like a showdown in the wild west, sometimes resulting in a draw (two parties claim a table at the same time and a new sort of standoff begins). I think I could muster up a fourth star should they get a host to keep seating organized and clean on busy nights. Other than structural problems with service, I've had no real problems with the wait-staff.",

    "text": "Just had the pleasure of meeting a few friends here for appetizers and drinks a few weeks ago and enjoyed the dim ambiance of the Round Corner Cantina in the en vogue neighborhood of Lawrenceville.  There were 6 of us together and it was not a weekend night, but the place was busy and there were no seats in the back room with tables. We made due with some high top tables pulled together on the bar side. We were met with unenthusiastic service all night which was the only complaint that any of our party had. To exemplify the issue, a person from our party was standing at the bar while it wasn't crowded, no one was needing help, and the bartender was not doing anything but talking to another bar tender--all while looking at my friend but not helping him for a solid 5 minutes. Eventually he meandered over to help and then took another 5-10 minutes to refill some waters and sodas and bring a beer. Getting their attention to order food also took ages. The service was just--well, it was just weird in the awkward sense.  Even with bad service, the food was quite good. Their menu boasts mostly Mex, Tex-Mex, and Mex fusion style foods. Having lived in a largely Hispanic community before, I am very picky about admitting when non-Mexican Mexican food is good. I ordered seitan (a vegetarian protein) tacos and found that they came street style a la roach coach. They were really good, topped with red onion, cilantro, radish, and goat cheese. I really appreciated that the chef came out after our order went in to check about the cheese because it would make the item not vegan--he was friendly and on top of things. Chips and salsa were good too and everyone at our table--vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike--were quite in our appreciation of the yummy food. I definitely recommend this to anyone in the area but would suggest not going on a busy night as the serving staff was not good. For appetizer size food it wasn't cheap, but it was fresh and tasty.",

Nearly all of the drinks have some kind of fresh fruit or herbs in them, and they are delicious and different. Drinks are also about half the price that you'd pay elsewhere.  What I really came for, though, was the food.  I'd heard it was tasty, inventive, sort-of-authentic Mexican food.  I loved it!  I ordered the Patatas Gratinadas, a dish made with sweet potatoes, lots of cheese, and chipotle, served piping hot.  I also tried (devoured, actually) a friend's Frijoles con Queso, a cheesy bean dip.  They also make their own yummy tortilla chips.  What really struck me, though, was that they charged dive bar prices for great food!  The decor was great and the service was friendly. It got really crowded towards the end of our visit, with a wide variety of customers. I can't wait to go back, sit on the (soon to be heated) patio, and try more drinks and menu items.

Have been going here quite frequently for about 2.5 years and the remodel they did last year really took the place up a notch in terms of lighting and decor!   The new enclosed outdoor bar/seating is secluded even though it's in the middle of a city so it's a nice little get away!  The food here is just always fantastic, I've tried literally everything on their menu!  Personal suggestion is the campachano burrito!",

Perfect spice to the salsa. I also go the Pineapple's Revenge drink which was strong but good, it came with a metal straw which I was not a fan of. The service was good, the bartender took care of us and was very attentive. It was such a great value for everything we got as well!",

First time in was for a night cap after dinner elsewhere. It was pretty crowded - not hard to do as it's a pretty small place - but we eventually were able to squeeze in to a couple seats at the bar. I ordered one of their specialty cocktails, the Verde del Amor, and it was absolutely delicious and refreshing. The bartender told me they squeeze all their juices in house, and believe me, you can taste it. Yum! Second visit I was meeting a small group and we got there during happy hour and took advantage of the special pricing on their house margaritas (a tiny bit on the tart side, but I enjoyed it) and Dos Equis on draft. We then moved to a table in the TINY dining room and had chips and salsa and guac, and the nachos which are AMAZING. The quesadilla with caramelized onions was also really yummy. I was full at that point but others ordered tacos which looked really good, especially the one with mahi mahi. I look forward to going back with a bigger appetite and trying more. Particularly when the weather is warm again (someday!) so I can check out the patio. 4 Stars out of 5 because the cramped space is a little less than perfect, but not a big enough issue to keep me from going back for more!",

    "text": "I have very mixed feelings about the Cantina. My roommates and I frequent Round Corner, especially in the summertime, and we've had both positive and negative experiences there.  Cantina has the opportunity to be one of the coolest restaurants around in my opinion; the location is absolutely on point right in the heart of Lawrenceville, not to mention the fact that they have one of the best patios in the 'burgh for hanging out in the summertime. At the end of the day though, my review has to be more based on the food and the service than on the location. The food is good, but not great. Mexican is one of my favorite genres of food, and I have never been overly impressed with the food quality here. The guacamole and chips are very good if you are lucky to get them fresh - on a few occasions, we've had stale chips, which is a huge let down. The tacos are mediocre at best. I usually get the pollo tacos, which are good in a pinch but I'm not rushing back for them, especially when Smoke is a short walk away. In all honesty, I come to Cantina more for the great atmosphere than for the quality of the food.  The real reason why I give Cantina three stars instead of four is due to the service. Rarely have I had a positive experience with the wait staff at Cantina. The employees do not seem to have a high level of knowledge about the menu, and most of them have a snippy demeanor. You usually seat yourself at Cantina, especially on the patio, and I find that we often have to wait at least ten minutes for an employee to notice us and come over with menus. Also, I have now had two experiences at Cantina where items were listed incorrectly on the menu price-wise and I was charged more money on my bill than anticipated. When I mentioned this to my waitress, she apologized that the menu was wrong and assured me they would update the menu but did not change the amount on my bill, which seemed strange to me.  All of that being said, I still like to come to Cantina for happy hours and for the patio. I really hope Cantina steps up their service, because if they did they could easily gain another star in my book. At this point, in spite of the hip atmosphere, I can't go above three stars.",

Selecta, my absolute favorite DJ, held down the 1s and 2s offering a nice mix of EWF, house, soul, hip hop, and world (what genre is Fela Kuti? Whatever it is, it was awesomness). The vibe from the crowd was equally diverse and amazing. There was plenty of space to move around and the staff did a great job of clearing glasses from the tables throughout the night.  There was no cover charge, by the way. Don't know if that will change.  It was a feel good time and I'll definitely return. Granted, I'm not as young as I used to be, so I take a nap beforehand.

There is also a bar and a back patio.  I got the al pastor taco - so so good. A lot of flavor and nice portion size. My husband got the 12-hour brisket. Also amazing. We ordered the salsa and chips (fried in oil that crosses with flour)- nice way to start the meal.  As for gluten free options- about 1/3 is gluten free. No burritos allowed though. So you're basically stuck with tacos. Staff were very helpful checking on allergies. They offered to make my food separately.  Prices are fair- it's also a nice experience in terms of the vibe.

The front half is purely a bar--there's three or four small tables that serve as drink stands, the music and conversations are loud and it's dim (almost dark). But in the back there are tables and chairs, a quieter atmosphere and they actually serve up some decent tex-mex dishes.  When I'm there for food I always go for the pozole and steak tacos; happy hour tacos are half off (sha-wing!). The Tijuana Street Dog, a bacon wrapped hot dog slathered in all sorts of wonderment deserves a national holiday, but I save that for special occasions because I try to be nice to my arteries (sometimes).   When I'm there for drinks I get a mojito or margarita. Margaritas lean towards the salty side but are also tangy and refreshing; great combo with Mexican food and served in boho-chic jars. Their tequila selection is so-so, I mean, I really expect more options if you're going to devote a fourth of your drink menu to a particular liquor.   Make sure to bring out your best manners when ordering up at the bar, the bartenders can be a little rough around the edges at times. And it's in Lawrenceville so you can expect a pretty hip crowd, especially weekend nights.",

If you go on a busy night the service might be a little slow, but I don't fault them for this.  (Any time we've gone on a weeknight the service is quite fast.)  Sometimes the waitstaff is a little... \"eccentric,\" we have had a waitress a few times that calls us \"lady\" and \"man,\" which I find a bit weird, but she is attentive and otherwise friendly.  If you are a big eater, you could spend a bit of money here before you get full...  The booze is a bit pricey and they charged me for seltzer water (REALLY?) but those are pretty much my only complaints and the reasons why I couldn't give this place five stars.",

    "text": "A five star restaurant for me is a place firing on all cylinders, with great food and flawless friendly service. Each star down usually involves some sacrifice in these areas, with one star being bad at both. This is the first time I'm writing a review that is one star entirely because of service, because the food itself isn't bad. But the service was awful to the point that it is worth my time to warn people away after my experience there this event. I went in with a few friends for some drinks and snacks at the bar. I'm not sure what his problem was but the bartender was a complete jerk. Service was slow for us food wise and that normally isn't an issue but someone tending bar should be friendly and accommodating not snappy and rude for no reason. We weren't the only ones with an issue, as the bartender decided to yell across the restaurant at another party, making rude remarks about a patron and ordering her to leave. It was like being transported into the soup Nazi episode of Seinfeld and completely shocked us. This place must be doing great if they can afford to have an employee ordering clearly sober and not disorderly customers to leave and put off other customers in the process. It's rare to see a place throw money away like that but after seeing how that lady was treated and after the attitude my group got, they won't be having me back even if their food isn't bad. I can cook at home, I go out to eat for the experience and the service, and Cantina proved that they don't need customers or don't want them, I'm not sure which. I won't be recommending then to anyone now, and after putting on this type of display, I doubt I'm the only person who was put off.",

It's not big, and I suppose it can get crowdy and packed, although it was not bad when i went there this Friday. So, a good place to spend your evening.  So why 3 stars only?   I would have given 4 stars for the bar itself, but I am just rating the food and drinks here. The slow roasted pork tacos were good and tasty, but quite fat. I was afraid if the the pork were to touch my clothes, they would be stained permanently! Some will like that, others won't. The fish tacos were bland.   So, overall, not bad, and better than other mexican places in Pittsburgh, but you won't go there for the tacos.   Also, sadly, my margarita was quite small, and I could barely feel the tequila.  They don't have a waiting list, so you have to wait for a table. The dining area is small, and you may have to wait during the week end.   I'll be back, and I'll probably eat there again.

We just moved here from Southern CA (I was born here, but the husband is Cali through and through), so we have been searching high and low for an authentic mexican joint. I have been pretty nervous for him and the lack of familarity that he may experience, but we definately found a home here. The vintage wallpaper, artsy decor and screen projector is very reminesent of a Silverlake eatery-- the music is usually pretty great too.   I know that some people are not into the fact that thet don't take reservations (the place is usually packed), but it is worth the wait.  I threw the husband's 31st b-day here and, after emailing with the owner who is also a SoCal native, they tried their best to accomodate us despite the no-rez policy.   The happy hour specials are incredible. I have not had such an authentic mexi-cali taco with the cabbage, radish and crema anywhere else around. The drinks are fun (try the Sham-Diego), and there is usually some hilarious Mexican wrestling match on the screen.  It is the perfect spot to chat with friends, eat and chill after the daily grind of work. Oh, and the chips are magical.  Thank you Cantina!",

I have found the customers skew younger, but not necessarily more hip.  Other reviewers have called this a \"hipster bar\".    Honey, if you think these people are hipsters, I've got some news for you.    The service is not great even for this town.  Some of the waitresses are downright hostile.  Their attitude says \"How dare you order from me in order to tip me?\".  As someone who has worked in food/beverage I am continually astonished at how confrontational they are.  The tacos are great and cheap.  The vegetarian tacos were not as good as I was hoping they would be, but sticking with a meat that has been simmered in a sauce is never the wrong option.  The pork tacos tend to be better than the beef, with the pork belly as one of the stronger options.   The salsa and chips are very good.  Would return.",

It's got a great location and when you walk in, a maze-like hall will take you to a surprise patio in the back. It's great.  So why 3 stars for a great place? 2 reasons...  1. Service everytime I go is slllllllow! 2. We happened to go on a Friday night last week. As we stood in the patio area waiting on a table, I noticed it got to be a competion of who would rush to a table first. We has 2 groups steal tables from us. It really cuts down the mood a bit when you have to race to a table. Fix? Go during non busy hours?",

    "text": "Round Corner Cantina definitely accommodates the hipster crowd and isn't ashamed to make it painfully obvious. Having said this, I really enjoy their drinks and their food and have been lucky enough to dodge the sour bartender and poor service I've been hearing about.  I have to stress that you really can't walk into the Round Corner Cantina expecting to be served promptly. I wouldn't walk in with an empty stomach. Instead, I'd bring some good company that you don't mind passing the time with. I'd order a few drinks and get lost in conversation and be pleasantly surprised when my comes. It's not a restaurant, it's a bar that serves food and it functions as one.  On nice, warm nights the outside seating fills up fast and they do not seat you. It is every man and woman for themselves but both times I've been, I managed to snag a table without any problem.  The food is fresh and tasty. Their tacos are pretty authentic with a bit of Portland thrown in. Every so often you'll get a pretentious piece of this or that but all in all, they're pretty close to the real thing. The drinks are mixed well and done right, using quality alcohol and a nice touch.  Go into Round Corner knowing that the service is hit or miss and that it might take a while to get a seat, it'll make you less surprised and offended when you're not treated like an eater so much as a bar goer, waving the five between your two fingers around in the hopes that you get noticed.",

Once we were seated, after waiting a very reasonable amount of time for 8 pm on a Saturday, we ordered chips/salsa and I got the carne tacos.    The chips were hand-fried and perfect.  I love chips and salsa...simple, but delicous, and these did not dissapoint.  Despite my aversion to soft taco shells (I often forget soft is the norm, hard tacos on a menu are rare) and my initial disappointment seeing them come out soft...I was pleasantly surprised that they were VERY good.  I would not have thought simply steak, radishes and a avocado/cilantro based sauce/salsa would make a good taco, but it DID!  It was different, and it was great.  I think the radishes did wonders for the texture/crispness of the taco.    I understand why everyone loves this place.  Add me to the list.",

    "text": "I cannot express what a terrible experience we had here last week.   A group of 8 of us went to get a drink on a Thursday Night. We had heard the patio was a nice place so we walked in and saw a nice comfy booth to sit in. As we tried to sit down (there were no servers to be found or reserved signs) we were told there was a $200 minimum to sit in the booth. Ummm, no. We just each wanted one drink. The place was dead, so we found another table to sit at.  The waitress came over and brought us each a menu, but never brought us any waters after we each asked for one while we perused the menu. Finally, we each placed our order. One girl asked the waitress for a very specific drink recommendation (nothing fruity or sweet), and placed an order for the drink that was suggested by the waitress. After receiving our drinks, two of the orders had problems. One drink tasted like it had absolutely NO alcohol in it at all. The other recommended drink was exactly the opposite of what was asked for- fruity and sweet!  The drink that had \"no alcohol\" in it was taken away from our table for several minutes to check with the bartender. It was brought back and we were told \"Yes, this drink has alcohol in it, we know how to make all of our drinks.\" And it was handed back to us. We found this very strange but didn't want to make an issue of it, so we drank it anyway.  We told the waitress that her recommendation did not fit with what we asked for and that the drink was far too sweet and fruity to be consumed. Without ever mentioning a policy, she took the drink and walked away.   When we received the check, we were charged for the drink that the waitress took away from the table! After we asked about this, we were told this was their policy. She sent over the horrible, rude manager who told us that she didn't care what we thought about their restaurant, but it's not their fault we didn't like the drink (even though we SPECIFICALLY asked for a recommendation). They have a really crappy policy of treating their customers like dirt, serving shitty beverages, and charging for drinks that are terrible.  Save yourself a lot of headache, and go to Franktuary where the drinks are better and cheaper and the service is FANTASTIC! This place is SO NOT WORTH IT!",

I get that people make mistakes, but when it's happened consistently at least half a dozen times, the bartenders really need to step up their game and get their ish together.",

There is ample outdoor seating when the weather is nice.  All the fare is just slightly unusual compared to El Campesino or Mad Mex. I love the fresh radishes in the tacos, and for me, corn tortillas are a must have! Lots of vegetarian options too.  Bar service has been inconsistent - I swear I've had bartenders look right through me. . . . they seem to either be very good or very mediocre - not in drink preparation but just in attentiveness.   One downside - the bar is all hard surfaces, so it gets very loud! This seems a common problem with new restaurants these days. Also, since it serves as the unofficial pre-bar for Piccolo Fiorno across the street, it can get very busy.",

I'm not sure of the bartenders name (it was a woman with dark hair if I remember correctly) but she was great. Also, I always appreciate when I get good service even though I'm not a heavy drinker. I recognize that the bartender could focus on people racking up a higher tab (and I do feel this is often justified...service industry is seriously underpaid and you gotta do what you gotta do to make more tip money) but I didn't get this impression here.

Unless you have a seat at the bar or are lucky enough to be trapped there and can get the bartender's attention, the service is abysmal at best, non-existant at worst.  Note to everyone - if you plan on having dinner, you will be there all night.  Cancel all other plans.  If you're lucky, you will get your dinner around last call.  The one time I was actually served food at Round Corner, the food was pretty good..  It was also empty, so that is why I was able to actually order.    So maybe the long wait is a bit of hyperbole, but we arrived at Round Corner around 7.  We were seated quick enough, however the waiting game had just started.  We weren't greeted by our waitress for about 10 minutes who said she would be right with us and disappeared for another 10.  At least she returned with water for all.  She took our drink order and left without our food order.    This is when I realized we were in trouble. At 7:45, she returned with our drinks and promptly walked away again.  Yes, if you're doing the math, it took 25 minutes to get a round of 4 drinks.  All beer.  She returned around 8pm, by then we had been there an hour and we asked first for another round (to get a head start on that) and ordered our dinner.  That was the last we saw of her.    After another 15 minutes or so, my friend went to the bar to find the status of our missing waitress. Our best guess was that she had been kidnapped and held for ransom unknown reason.  My friend returned in just under 5 minutes with a new round for us and said that they were free due to the circumstances.  By 8:45 we had finished all of our drinks and still had not even seen our waitress in the dining room.  At 8:46 we left money on the table for the beer and a note that the money was for her ransom and left on our way to Tamari never to return.",

The tacos are pretty awesome.  I've only had the seitan and the huitlacoche.  Both very fresh flavors...AND they use corn tortillas.  Should I write more?  Not really, but  I will.  The tacos come with two layers of tortillas.  The secret is to leave one layer on the plate and eat you single layered taco over that.  Then MAYBE, depending on how messy you are, you may have another taco. I'm just sayin.  I refuse to click the Hipster ambience.  It's ridiculous.",

When you walk in, it's so dark you can only see silhouettes of people at the bar.  For full effect, they should add a record scratching to a stop every time the door opens.  In fact, I've just trademarked that idea.  Once your eyes adjust, this place is actually pretty damn cozy.  You'll enter into the main bar, which has plenty of space.  Most of the mixed drinks are great, but the beer selection is...well, I just hope you like Dos Equis.  The back dining area is pretty comfortable, and they usually play one of those crazy Luchador action hero movies on the screen.    The menu is taco based (with a few exceptions) and I am okay with that.  Everything is functionally pretty decent.  There's nothing necessarily that I go home and crave, but I think the overall vibe of the place goes a long way toward correcting this.  In the warmer months, they have a back patio that effectively doubles the size of the restaurant, which is also decorated perfectly to the theme.  The only drawback is that each time I've been here, the waitstaff seems a bit overwhelmed with the crowds.  Oh, and the cement benches in the back are so low that you will see no less than four hipster ass cracks.  It's alright to throw pennies at them though.  Legend tells that if you land a penny betwixt those scrawny cheeks, you win 1,000 free tacos.  I might have made some of that up though.",

The bean dip was pretty good, but the chips and salsa were uninteresting and the pork belly tacos I got tasted mostly like bland fat (some hints of flavor there).  The margaritas were just OK.  There isn't much seating here and it gets pretty crowded.  The limited hours may contribute to that...  On the plus side, the service is pretty good and the interior decorations, while sometimes corny, make for a fun feel.",

I took friends from California there and they said the tacos held up to CA standards. But the last few times I have gone have been disappointing. The tacos were no longer as flavorful as they once were. Last night, however, was one of the worst meals I've had anywhere in a long time. I had the brisket tacos. They were cold and the meat was both dry and slimy and completely without taste. I had a bite of my companion's burrito and it was quite a bit better, but still. The food here has been getting worse for some time. It's quite the disappointment because I used to love this place so much.",

Unfortunately they were not impressed with the wait for a table outside.  (Refer to first sentence. Everyone else had the same idea). After about 20 minutes of waiting and coaxing a table from 6 guys we finally sat. Beware!  Outdoor service is notoriously slow. If you're extra thirsty, grab a drink at the front bar before having a seat.   Otherwise my Dark and Stormy really got me going!  The Sangria leaves a lot to be desired however.  Frijoles dip? Gross. Do without it. But I have to say the guacamole was fantastic!  Overall, it worked for us. Will I be dying to go there in the near future?  Probably not. But it's worth a try!  Oh, hey Mr. Security Man!  I hear there is great karaoke on Thursdays though. My opinion might change!",

Served in mason jars with fresh lime slices and salty rims. We started off with the queso fundido which was very tasty, great chips and spicy cheese. We then had the fries that were served liked nachos!!! Wow they were so good with fresh quac and salsa and fresh jalapenos slices. Such a cool vibe, good music great food cool atmosphere. Next time you're in Larry-vile, stop in!!  Update:   Since the last review, I we stopped in twice, first time we sat inside upstairs and was seated by the host. After sitting for over ten minutes, a waitress never showed up. Even though there three of them standing at the hostess station so, after 10 more minutes, we left. Today, we went back to sit outside on the patio on a beautiful sunny day, we walked up stairs and waited by the hostess station, after being ignored for a few minutes the host said, just go out and find a seat.  So we went out to the patio and sat along the back bar because it was the only seats open, so after sitting there for several minutes, a host came back and said rudely \" we aren't really sitting people back here\", \"I'll have to let the waiter know\" She dropped off two waters and That was the last we saw her After 5 more minutes, we got up and left. That was twice, there won't be a third. As great as a place can be, it doesn't matter if your service is terrible. We will not be back for a third time.",

    "text": "Yikes. I had high hopes for this place, but was disappointed in several things. This place wasn't busy for a Sunday at brunch time, but the lack of attention from our server made it seem that way. We waited a while to place our food orders and when the food came out, mine was missing. Our server asked if I had gotten food (as if she didn't take my order 15 minutes before). She politely said she'd run back and get it, but then returned to say it was almost ready. I am thinking she just forgot to put my order in as it didn't arrive until my friends were almost done with their meals.   I had the breakfast tacos which were good. A helping of rice and beans (on the smaller side) came with them. I also had 2 of the house margaritas - also on the smaller side but good.  My friends all had the French toast which they described as decent, but the bacon on the side was a big downer - very overcooked. They got potatoes on the side as well (also thought some of these were overlooked) and were surprised when they asked for ketchup and the server said they don't have any (at all, ever). Kind of odd for any restaurant that serves any type of potato I thought.   I did really enjoy their (I'm guessing) homemade tortilla chips and salsa. I would maybe give this place another shot on a different day as I'm sure their lunch and dinner options are better and maybe we were just there on an off day.",

All of the places across the street that SAID they were open were dirty liars because they closed their kitchen 45 minutes early and couldn't even spare a cold french fry. Anyways, their loss, because I stumbled into this cantina like a cat in the rain looking for sustenance and wow it was amazing! I'm from SoCal so I know good Mexican food, and most of Pennsylvania has never even met a proper taco, but this place was super high quality and authentic and delicious. We sat on the back patio and it was beautiful out. They sat us right away. We got shrimp tacos, fish tacos, a California burrito, rice, beans, and churros. I also got a painkiller cocktail. Everything tasted super good and came quick and was reasonably priced. We loved it so much we came back the next day, and I think I might have to move here. It blew every other restaurant in town out of the water. Board up your kitchen and just come here every day!",

It definitely gives off a vibe that it's a good place to just come and hang out with a group of friends.   The food itself isn't that spectacular. I got the carnitas tacos and I was a little disappointed. They weren't very flavorful. My friends also ordered the queso, corn, soup, and a burrito. The queso was very good and soup were very good. The corn could have used more toppings all around rather than just piling everything on top of 1 side. The burrito looked like it was going to be very good but the verde sauce on top was very dense and flavorless. Tasted nothing like verde sauce in my opinion. I also think some of the food is a little overpriced. The amount of queso you get for $8 is not much at all.   As for the drinks we go michaladas and margaritas. The michaladas I was not impressed with. I think if they added the tajin seasoning as a rim it could be a lot better. The margaritas I wasn't all that impressed with either. They were good but they also had a weird taste.   Ambiance: 4 Food/Drink quality: 3 Presentation: 3 Price: 3 Overall: 3",

It was so bad the second time the server gave me free guacamole & apologized for her awful service.  The only reason we went back was the food is very good. Last time I had the chorizo tacos & they were delicious. This time I had carne Asada & they were also very good. My husband had carnitas (pork) & he really enjoyed them too. I tried the house margarita & it was terrible. The taste was disgusting. Not sure what their other drinks are like.  In the past they had elote (Mexican street corn), but no longer have it. Too bad! It was delicious.  The guacamole is expensive, but delicious.",

    "text": "This place is what it is. A small Mexican food joint situated in the heart of Lawrenceville with great margaritas, beautifully fried tortilla chips, and awesome guacamole. The tacos are not bad! They taste sort of like the tacos over at Bakersfield, but these are much better IMO.  Whatever it is, it is an awesome place to start off a night out, especially if you can get seats outside in the back patio. The prices are very reasonable and the food is definitely tasty (not earth shattering mind blowing Mexican food), but it does the trick. Think savory Mexican food made fresh by the local gringo on santa ana boulevard in California who probably spent his days surfing in Baja, dated a Oaxacan senorita, and learned how to cook up some good classic tex mex that anyone would find delicious and even go back for more.  Fun atmosphere, delicious bites, great margaritas, good drink selection, overall awesome place to chill out before a night out in Pittsburgh's Williamsburg.",

This place doesn't look like much at first glance- however, it doesn't take long to realize you just struck gold. Within the first 5 min with only a sip of my margarita- I knew. The drink was authentic and clean. No cheap syrups or unnecessary ingredients. The service was quick and friendly- literally what more could you ask for? And the food- just wow. It's not a big place, but the atmosphere is warm and welcoming. You've got to go experience this place for yourself. If you appreciate quality authentic Mexican food- you will not regret it.",

    "text": "Round Corner Cantina gets a 5-star rating for having some really awesome decor, but the service and food is truly lacking. I ordered what sounded like would be a delicious quesadilla and salsa and chips. The quesadilla lacked flavor which was the opposite of what I expected given the description, and the salsa had no spice or excitement to be found. Overall, I spent $18 on a small meal that was delivered by a rude server.   I don't have a desire to come back here. Food options for me are particularly limited, and I am not a drinker. I've heard people comment that their alcoholic bevs are fantastic, so if that's your thing - try for yourself.   Warning: it gets loud, crowded, and intense pretty quickly! Again, if that's your scene, you will probably LOVE Round Corner Cantina.   My favorite thing about the place was learning about the Round Corner Hotel history.",

I've always loved their bloody marias but only recently tried the food.  A friend and I went the other week for brunch and the menu seemed interesting enough. I ordered French toast with a chipotle butter and ancho syrup. Overall, it wasn't bad. I never order sweet breakfast food but the chipotle and ancho balanced out the sweetness of the toast. I do gave a few gripes about the meal though. The amount of butter given saturated the toast so much so that half way through, I couldn't bring myself to finish the meal. The meal also was just French toast. It didn't feel complete. I understand that some places are a la carte but my friend ordered the hash and his order seemed a lot more complete. It was more than enough food for me but it just would have felt like more of a meal if it had maybe a slice less and maybe a compote of sorts. I will go back but maybe just stick to the drinks!",

The drinks are pretty good, they are all REALLY strong! I wish they had more non-tequila options but oh well. Just one thing: don't order the bloody marys unless you like well vodka mixed with salsa. Luckily, if you're here for brunch most of their cocktails can double as socially acceptable day-drinking options, so avoiding the bloody marys isn't too hard.  The other thing I love about Cantina is their outdoor patio, which is the perfect summer chill spot. I'd actually give it 5 stars, if it weren't for the horrible service. I know it's a dive bar, and I'm not expecting the best restaurant experience of my life here, but the servers are seriously unhelpful and at times, just plain rude. Still, it's one of my favorite happy hour spots. Pork belly always trumps poor service, in my mind.",

The back patio is really charming and they seem to have spruced it up a bit (new tables, greenery, etc).  I don't even feel like I'm in Pittsburgh when I'm out there.  The food and atmosphere are super impressive.  It does get crowded late at night, though, so be prepared for that.  I prefer to go for lunch.  Oh, and I was hoping to get some tres leche cake, but unfortunately, they don't serve any desserts.  I'm still giving it 5 stars - better for my diet!",

The menu is great, even from a California/Southwest Mexican food snob perspective. And the bar is cozy in the winter. The staff is also friendly and plays good music. Atmosphere is quasi-1890's frontier.  Update: After their renovation of the backyard and staff changes, I have to say that Cantina has taken a dip in the quality of the food and service. Some of the waitstaff from the opening is still there and very good, but the newer waitresses they've hired are not as great as the original crew.  Somehow, the bar crowd also went from refreshingly hip to baby boomer in the last couple of months.",

My friend had some chicken and potatoes dish wrapped around corn husks; however after several drinks we weren't aware you don't eat the husks!  It would have been nice for our server to fill us in on this minor detail. The chips and guacamole were excellent and the chips appeared homemade. It is small inside and pretty dark, so I recommend either going for happy hour and/or trying to sit outside.",

    "text": "Dropped in on this place last Saturday. Kept hearing about in via word of mouth, so grabbed the 86B and strolled down the hill.   Given neighborhood, I initially confused the place, for someone having a lively houseparty. An old head-high fence and hanging lamps with their illumination filtering through the wood beams.  The crowd is not what I call a traditional \"hipster\" crowd that you may encounter  a la Brillobox. More \"mature\" if that has any meaning nowadays. The front bar area was small, but never gave off the impression of sardine packed-in-ed-ness. What appealed to me the most is the general sociability of the place. They talk to strangers here, and while that may be tied to the people than the place, per se, it adds to it, imho.  All waitresses/servers are *amazingly* hot and friendly. Grabbed a seat. Drank two caipirinhas and a hopdevil. Packed full of kick. Mason jars, are strange to drink out of, unless you are from the south or Missouri.  I have no such problem, and it gives off a very down-to-earth air that I would expect out of Lawrenceville. Costs seem to be \"midling.\" 6-7 bucks for some of the drinks. That is not huge to me, but may be to others.  Menu looked tasty, and had some Spanish and Mexican beers I ran into during my foreign travels.  Did not sample food menu, but will in the future.   A great jukebox, and given the sensitivity of my ears, the volume was not too too bad...for a while. Later on that night, not sure if they cut it higher or if certain albums play louder than others. It seemed less of a problem than other places in terms of sheer \"blast.\"  There appears to be a secondary room of tables and chairs behind the front bar area, and going further to the rear of the establishment and up the hill is an intriguing grassy patio area. Did not explore that, because I'm a friendless wuss who is afraid of looking like a loser, but if you come with 5+ folk, you may want to snag a spot out there early and see what stars you may be able in amongst all the air pollution.  This is close to a 5, but I only gave 4 due to the slowness of getting served at times. It seems like there is no bar to serve clients on the rear-patio area; the two ladies in the front were very busy cranking out drinks for all, so I could not fault them for the time it took. The time was due to the crush, versus indicative of any rudeness or lack of attentiveness. If they could resolve that, or add more barstaff, I think it would tip it over into perfection.  This place has character, good service, good people, and thankfully is a work in progress.",

Their drink creations are also pretty great. I love me a margarita. I can't recall any really bad experiences with service, but I also have never gotten spectacular service either.",

    "text": "I finally went back to Round Corner Cantina in honor of a dearly departed friend, who simply adored the brunches.  The Sunday Brunch is worth 4 stars: $4 Bloody Marys or Bloody Marias.  Both well-mixed and priced right.  Not too crowded.  The catch is that this place is intolerable on weekends.  Being that Butler St. only has a dozen bars, this should be a top choice for me.  But it's not.  The service is incredibly slow.  Worst than that, the server knew nothing about the drinks.  I tried to ask about the Carnation, but she had to look at the menu to see which drink I was referring to.  I ordered it anyway.  What looked to be a mix of the best attributes of my two favorite cocktails--the Cosmo and the Dark 'N Stormy--was just a heavy dose of ginger beer with a splash of mediocre vodka, a touch of cran juice, far too much lime, and way too much ice.  It was a hot night and the drink was thoroughly watered down by the time it got to me.  I'd be inclined to blame the server over the bartender, but I'm not sure.  I'm not a professional bartender, but when I serve drinks with ice on days over 80 degrees, I make specialty ice cubes with the drink ingredients to not water down the drink.  For $7, I certainly wasn't expecting my cocktail to be a third water by the time it arrived.  Finally, the food.  In a word: eh.  I thought both of the pork tacos were all right.  But the pollo tinga was downright awful.  Chicken in all varieties is one of my food staples, but something unholy was done to this poultry.  The guac was decent, but honestly Mad Mex has better...and if you're claiming to be authentic Mexican anything, Mad Mex should not best you on any detail.  To top it off, they charge $3.5 for chips and salsa and then only refill the chips but not the salsa.  C'mon.",

    "text": "Despite living in and around Lawrenceville for quite a few years, I had never been to the Cantina before last night. I had been put off by the pricey menu and the large crowds outside on the weekends, but my friend had driven in from Braddock to go to dinner and had his heart set on the Cantina so I gave it a shot.  I'll start with the good part; the food. The chips and salsa were fan-freaking-tastic. The salsa was spicy, but not overwhelmingly so and the chips were salty and super crispy. We ate two baskets of them! My friend had his old standby, the vegan tacos. They were beautiful and he seemed to enjoy them (he scarfed them down before my food even got to the table, but in his defense he was starving). I had the Papas Gratinadas (sweet potato with chipotle and queso Chihuahua) and that was just as delicious. The potatoes sure didn't look or taste like sweet potatoes, but that didn't disappoint me. Over all, our bill was manageable, but still a little rich for my blood.  Here's where this place lost me, the atmosphere. There are people for whom a place like the Cantina is great, I am not one of them. It was extremely crowded and loud, I could barely hear my friend over the music. Other than that, there was just a lot going on; between the patterned wallpaper, the fringe on the ceiling, the HUGE TV playing the strangest movie I've ever seen, the music and the constant motion around our table (it was busy, so that's not their fault), I felt like I was going crazy. I actually had no idea what I had ordered, because I couldn't concentrate on the menu, so I ordered the first thing I saw. I would come here for happy hour, but if that's how busy they are on a Wednesday night, it will probably not become a dinner favorite. Again, take this review with a grain of salt, I don't like crowds. If you don't mind the Brillobox on a Friday night, you should be fine. I, however, needed an hour and 5 cigarettes to calm the hell down.   Overall; great food, excellent service, too hip for this girl.",

    "text": "Mixed bag myths busted: After reading about how rude the service was and that people are out for blood when it comes to getting a seat and   despite the fabulous food many declared never to return, my boyfriend and I  headed out to the Cantina.   It was a perfect night for the patio and after almost heading back in to get seats, the good seat/parking spot fairy sprinkled a little dust and TA-DA seats.  We ordered drinks (me tea, him beer) and chips&salsa.  Our server seemed annoyed like she was going to live up to the \"rude\" label that so many had attached the to service.  She turned out to be very kind and paid the right amount f attention to us.  Refills, beers general check ins are came in a timely manner.  I had the seitan tacos-very fresh, would have liked a little spice and will alter my order next time.  My boyfriend had the quesadilla de la parrilla and thought he was going to implode he enjoyed it so much.  Our server (again bustin' up the myths) informed us the quesadilla takes a bit longer to cook but that the wait was well worth it.)   Overall had a great night and would return again....in a heartbeat.  I can see the place getting negative reactions as yes it does get crowded, yes people smoke outside and yes the servers are busy and will not going hold your hand all night and/or stop and chat you up.  But it is a bar for goodness sakes!   Keep that in mind, don't take yourself too seriously and you will enjoy your night....",

The mezcal Manhattan was one of the best cocktails I've had in Pittsburgh. The classic Manhattan is one of my favorite drinks, so I wasn't sure how I would feel about one made in a Mexican restaurant with mezcal. It was delightful. Fresh and homemade ingredients made for a refreshing, but strong cocktail. The bartender gladly shook in a few extra dashes of bitters at my request.  When I ordered a beer for my second round, he actually said \"are you sure I don't mind making you another Manhattan.\" I was very impressed by the friendly service.  Really looking forward to stopping back to try their grub, but honestly I would come back just for late night drinks. Well done, Mr. Bartender.",

I'm sure I'll make my way there eventually, but for now I can only imagine the wonders said outdoor patio holds.  Round Corner Cantina is pretty good indoors too.  My relationship with Round Corner Cantina is simple & pure. If I'm breathing, then I want tacos.  They have good tacos, and they'll bring tacos to my table in a friendly fashion.  They've got good cocktails, good beer, and I think they are reasonably priced.  They have fun drink specials.  I like coming here for food, I don't know if I'd come here to hang out because I feel like I'm too old for their crowd  ...although their lack of lighting could help me blend in.  In the one back room, its really dark.    So if you're on a date with someone who is not exactly a feast for the eyes, take them here.  There's tacos and it's dark.  Your situation will immediately be improved 100%.  tip:  this place is ALWAYS packed.  If you LOVE to sit during happy hour, I recommend getting here early to stake your claim to a seat.",

I have been here on two occasions, once in the summer and last night and I definitely recommend coming here when the weather is a warm so you can sit outside. Their patio is tucked away from the street, a perfect little escape in Lawrenceville. Not to say I don't like the interior, it's artsy vibe and dim lighting are perfect for a date. The downside is there just isn't enough space, so the wait can be long if you have a larger group.  I ordered the house margarita, which are strong in the best way, but nothing amazing. I'm not a huge fan of OJ in my marge so next time I would probably try one of their micheladas. My friend had the Mexicana michelada with Dos Equis, cilantro, jalapeno, and lime. The cilantro and jalapeno combination is refreshing with a nice kick.  Their homemade tortilla chips and guac are amazing. I had the shrimp tacos - very cheesy with good cilantro and lime flavors. Their taco list is pretty extensive and I like how they focus on their specialty rather than trying to do it all. I love the overall vibe and drink selection and will definitely be back for summer nights on the back patio.",

    "text": "I've chosen to go here once. Usually I end up here because there is a line at Piccolo Forno across the street so I grab a drink until they call me. *side note- Round Corner Cantina should pay Piccolo Forno a royalty because every time I go to Piccolo Forno there are people at Cantina waiting to be called to Piccolo.*  Anyway, I chose to go there once to see how it is on a Friday night. I'm a shorter guy so it takes a little effort at the bar to get a drink. The bartender (a male) notices me and says \"I'll be right there bud\" - which I hate, no one wants to be called \"bud.\" I'm having a conversation with a friend but I'm very obviously the next person in line and I keep making the \"I need a drink\" motions. Eventually the bartender returns to where we are- next in line- looks over my head, right over me, I start ordering because I think he's just busy and not making eye contact, and takes he order from the guy behind me!   I'm irritated so I say \"WTF man?!\" [But the words not the acronym.] \"You said you were going to be \"right here bud, then you take he guys behind me's order?!\"   Bartender snaps his fingers and before I know it the doorman- or whoever he is- is trying to escort me out. Mind you I haven't had my first drink yet, not drunk, not even that rude. Just trying to get some service. The bartender asks me - \"are you going to chill the 'F' (uses whole word) out??\" I say \"I have been chill but okay.\"   The doorman 'allows' me to stay. I order a double jack and diet- I never order doubles but I knew I had to because I didn't want to relive the aforementioned experience.  $18 jack and diet double. $18.00. Yes, eighteen.   Not going back. If you're in Lawrenceville, and not waiting to get into Piccolo Forno, you can do much much better and if you are waiting for Piccolo just go to Franktuary right next door, you'll pay less and get treated with respect.",

    "text": "I wanted to like Round Corner Cantina. I really did. But I have to say, after my first visit here I'm not dying to come back.  Before you even enter this place you have to deal with something that isn't really their fault: parking. And navigating traffic. On Butler Street. Always a joy! Once I managed to deal with this step and actually entered Cantina I wasn't really encouraged; the music was playing too loudly for my taste in the front room and wasn't much better in their back room, which was so dark I had to wonder how people even read their menus if they sit there.   Looking for somewhere a bit quieter and brighter, my dinner companion and I headed to their outdoor patio, where we found high tables and chairs that I honestly thought I'd fall off of at some point during the meal, they were so unsteady. Fortunately that never happened, because we were right next to a part of the fence where the beams were extremely splintered - just thinking about tipping into them was painful!  Unfortunately, the service did absolutely nothing to improve my opinion of the place; I watched three tables that arrived after us get service. No one ever came to our table. After we finally flagged a waitress attending to a group a couple tables over, she said she'd grab our waitress. And we waited some more. While we waited the waitress that we flagged down went ahead and brought us some water...that came in plastic cups. I shudder to imagine just how much trash this place discards every day from these cups alone...  After finally ordering and waiting for what at least wasn't an unreasonable amount of time, I was able to enjoy a pretty tasty drink that came in a jar (they have jars for alcohol but not for your water?) but was disappointed with my pork tacos. The shells were kind of mushy and the sauce and toppings minimal; mine just didn't taste all that special. My dinner companion's fish tacos were actually better; I kind of wish we'd swapped.  I left just feeling let down. I honestly would've been happy to forgive this place's rustic look and loud music if the service and food were a bit better, but as it is I just don't see anything here that I'd want to brave the dreaded Butler street traffic again for.",

However, I'm not one of those people who views food as an art and the only questions I ask at restaurants are, \"does this have dairy in it\" and \"where are your restrooms?\" So I'm not great at critiquing like other users are.  I will say that the drinks are fantastic. I love the Michelada drinks which are just Bloody Mary's made with beer. Yum! I also am a fan of their Sangria & Margaritas.  Their fresh tortilla chips are on point, you guys - especially when they are right out of the fryer. Their guac is so green and delicious. It's different than the usual restaurant guacamole - avocado, cilantro, like and big slices of jalapeno.   Admittedly, I've only gotten tacos once there as I usually live off of chips, guac, and a drink. Their taco salad is pretty delicious if I do say so myself.  They have a great brunch. I am in love with their deep fried French Toast that is the perfect combination of sweet and spicy.  The atmosphere is really neat. There are two different and unique seating areas in the building, and then an amazing back patio. The back patio is such a fun place to sit around and catch up with friends. It's right down the street from me, so it's pretty much a weekly destination spot for me.  My only issue is that the staff can come off disinterested sometimes. I even read some of their responses on Facebook from management and, as a Social Media Manager, bad replies really stress me out. Obviously, this won't stop me from going there, but I do think finding better staff is something they could work on.",

My friend and I went for Sunday brunch shortly after they opened (11AM), and had no trouble grabbing seats right away at the bar. We started, of course, with Bloody Marias while looking over the menu--they're on special for $4 during brunch hours, which is a great deal.   I eventually settled on the Brisket Hash. I love savory breakfasts and this seemed like a solid choice. The dish consisted of soft, salty potatoes topped with tender and flavorful brisket, bacon, a fried egg, onions, and cilantro. I added a dash of hot sauce for some spice, but overall the dish was packed with flavor. The portion size was perfect for the price ($9) and left me satisfied but not uncomfortably full as brunches so often do.   I've always been happy with the drinks here, and now that I've enjoyed the brunch, I need to make it back to try the regular menu sometime soon.",

But this just makes me sound old. So on to the good part, the food! So good! I had the mahi mahi taco's and the pork taco's and they are exceptional! I love when they put cabbage in a taco, I know that sounds weird, but it's just so tasty with the marinade they use!   I know that Chi Chi's (RIP) trained me to expect free chips and salsa, so it's always nice to have them free. Sorry to burst the bubble, but they're four bucks a pop....BUT it is an endless basket. Which is good because it usually disappears in about 5.5 seconds. I'm also a big judge of salsa, and this salsa definitely passes the test, with just the right amount of kick!   I do LOVE the outside area! There's tons of seating and benches and it's just so great to sit out there on a nice warm summer night with a tall glass of Dos Equis! And I am SO into tequila...badly into it. So watch out, because that bill can get high when that's in the mix! You can also trip down the steps in the dark as night dining room after too many....",

My hubby had two chorizo and papas tacos and I had a two tacos that had a shrimp and cheese filling the name escapes me.  The menu boasts of house made chorizo but we could barely taste any chorizo in the tacos. There seemed to be only one shrimp cut up into 3 pieces in each of my tacos.   I watched the cook walk back and forth between the kitchen and the dining room 8 times touching everything in the dining room and sitting down with a waitress to eat chips and salsa.  Granted the NBA Dunk Contest was on the bigscreen so it's possible that he didn't want to miss out on the action.  I would expect more professionalism from a place that charged $8 for two tacos.",

    "text": "I have never written a Yelp review before, but I have also never suffered such unjust and hostile treatment at a drinking or dining establishment. The staff at Round Corner Cantina tried their very best to ruin my New Years Eve.    Despite having recently heard horror stories on Facebook about the way they are known to treat their customers, I went to Round Corner Cantina with a group of friends to ring in the New Year. We paid the hefty $20 cover charge to get in, ordered a round of drinks, and moved to the dance floor in the back bar area. We were having a great time, but after a few minutes, I was bumped and spilled my beer on the floor.  Being a responsible patron, I went looking for a staff member to tell, so that nobody would slip. I didn't see anyone in the dance floor area, so I stood in a short hallway with one door that went behind the bar, and another that went downstairs to the basement. I thought I had just seen somebody go downstairs, so I waited for a minute or two just inside the hall. Nobody came by, so I poked my head behind the bar to tell the bartender.   As he walked by, I got his attention, and told him that I had spilled a drink on the dance floor. He didn't seem to register what I'd said, immediately snapping at me that I couldn't be in the staff-only area. I apologized politely, and repeated that I just wanted to let him know I had spilled a drink, so that he could send somebody to wipe it up. He again ignored my request, responding angrily, \"I don't care what you want to tell me, you can't [EXPLETIVE] be back here!\" Taken aback by his unreasonably aggressive response, I turned to go back, muttering that I was trying to help, and that he didn't have to be such a d*ck about it  (note that I am an extremely non-confrontational person, but can't put up with being treated like crap for trying to do something thoughtful).  Registering my words (seemingly for the first time), he lunged through the door and grabbed me by the arm, roaring, \"Did you call me a d*ck? Do you know who I am? I AM THE BARTENDER!\" Without letting me get in a word of reason, he pushed me forcefully through the entire bar, and out the door, where the bouncer then insisted that I stand across the street.   Now, outside in a t-shirt in roughly 17 degree weather, I texted my friends to come out and bring my coat and sweater. Since the coat racks were overflowing, they were unable to find my things. One of my friends very politely asked the manager if I could come back just to grab my things. She didn't seem to understand his request, and when he explained the problem twice more, she became defensive, shouting, \"YOU THINK YOU'RE ABOVE ME? YOU THINK YOU'RE BETTER THAN ME?\"  After managing to find my coat (but not sweater), all seven of my friends left with me, having spent $140 on cover, and roughly $50 on drinks, for about 10 minutes of dancing and 30 minutes of rummaging through coats and getting yelled at by incompetent, immature, confrontational staff members. We counted down to midnight in my frigid exile across the street from the bar, and went on to enjoy the rest of our night at Brillobox -- which I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone looking for great a place to go in the area.  So please, even if you read this review and dismiss it as a drunken new years incident (which it certainly was not, the spilled drink being my first of the night) just take a look at some of the other negative reviews. You'll notice a clear pattern of people identifying the bartender and the manager particularly as real jagoffs. They are childish, combative and dense at best. How they've managed to sustain themselves this long while apparently serving pricey, mediocre fare and treating their paying customers like criminals is beyond me. Lawrenceville is one of the best places in town to have a good time on a weekend or week-night. I've had countless positive experiences there with friendly staff, good friends and good drinks. Pick any other place, but please don't help put off the imminent self-destruction of these idiots by bringing them any more of your business.",

I had two organic margaritas and an order of the Pescado(fish) tacos. The tacos were good (a little bland for my taste), and the drinks were strong!   The music they played that night was amazing, 90s rap and R&B. I don't know if people dance there, but I was ready to bust a move! The women's bathroom is set up awkwardly... You enter into a very small room with one sink, then you enter into another small room with one toilet... I hope you're not claustrophobic!   All in all it was a good time!",

I will say that we went for happy hour and they were accommodating to 5 people with plenty of tables for us to pick and they had really fast service! FREE CHIPS AND SALSA!!   I was loving the $5 taco deal. You had your choice between, something, something, something else, and fish. I of course picked fish because it is what I am always drawn to. I don't even remember any of the other choices, because when you can pick fish why pick anything else?!  The plate for $5 came with two fish tacos. I will not say that these were the biggest tacos I have ever seen but they did fill me up without leaving me stuffed. I enjoyed them. AND THEY ARE SERVED WITH CORN TORTILLAS. Personal favorite.   I also got the $5 sangria. It came in a tall mason jar and hit the spot. It wasn't overly sweet and was topped with just a simple orange slice. I thought that was nice, more room for the booze and less room for fruit that would be hard to eat/get out of the jar.   So for about $10, not including tip I had a really fulfilling meal. What else would anyone want other than that!?   I will say the wait staff was super helpful and really nice. I was happy we picked Round Corner.",

When we brought this to the attention of the manager, she tried it and stated \"it tastes like straight tequila\" (which is also not the goal of an ideal margarita).

It's a pretty small place; mostly bar seating with a couple of tables off to the side. The alcohol/tequila section looked good; there was a wide variety. I didn't dive into this area though since I had to go to work, so this review is strictly food and service related. I ordered the mahi-mahi tacos with a side of guacamole. It took a while for the food to come out despite it not being super busy. I didn't get my guacamole until I was finished with my first taco and had already started eating my second. The mahi-mahi tacos were just ok. It seemed like they were trying to put too much into one taco, and the flavors didn't really mix all that well. The server was friendly though.",

It was a beautiful evening so we were able to sit outside which is a really cool space.  Seated right away and our server (pretty sure it was Jaime) was at our table asking for our drink order within a minute or two of being seated.  They were running great patio / happy hour specials too.    Had the Al Pastor tacos (2 of them in the order) and I can honestly say they were the best Al Pastor tacos I have ever had.  They were \"worth going out of your way for\" good.  Service was excellent throughout the meal.  Never had to wait on anything (drink refills, more chips, salsa, etc.).    Think this will be our goto spot when we are in Lawrenceville!!!",

I think there was a garnish? I was so shocked at how un-mary like my bloody mary was that after writing this review, I think I'll have to block the experience from my mind.   Onto the menu - it's changed quite a bit since I frequented it in 2010. The menu changes unfortunately have not been for the better. Their once eclectic selection which featured dishes like a cheesy au-gratin served in a cast-iron skillet, is now a page of run-of-the-mill mexican fare. While the selection is not the worst, it's not as good as it used to be and their tacos definitely don't come close to the top of my list.   The tacos:  Two soft shell corn tortillas that are soggy and fall apart easily. I had the seitan tacos, which I'd recommend as a decent veg option.   On the plus side, their guacamole is top-notch and they have a bomb patio. I highly recommend their chips, guac, and margaritas or sangria if you're looking to kick it with friends.  If the patio is full, the indoor bar and restaurant area ooze old-timey vibes -- so no matter where you're sitting, you'll definitely fall in love with the space -- sans their watery marys.",

As an out of towner... this is a huge plus.  The service at the bar is a little slow but they put together some really great drinks so I understand.  They also have some great Mexican beers on tap and serve them in Mason jars.  Bonus.  If I was to recommend one thing it would be the seasonal pickled veggies.  You get a Mason jar full of pickled vegetables (and sometimes some fruit) for about 4 bucks and it is always full of flavor, fun to eat, and a total crowd pleaser.  The patio is also pretty rad and has been packed with people every time I go.  I am giving four stars because I have a great experience every time I go to Round Corner and I recommend it to anyone.",

It's over priced, over hyped, and completely boring. I've been back since my first time, multiple times.  I love the pickled vegetables.  The taco's are okay but not really my favorite I've ever had.   The back patio is pretty much the best thing about this place.  They have a lovely brunch.

The waiters service and lines at the bar tends to be fairly slow, and you go inside, the food and drinks are fine, but to my tongue, nothing particularly special.    The real reason to go is the outdoor Patio.  If you're going to get margaritas and cold Mexican beers on a hot summer night in their outdoor courtyard, it's PERFECT.  Not too loud, it's easy to have conversations with friends and it's a very pleasant atmosphere with plenty of seating. So if you come for drinks with friends in their patio to get the most out of your round corner experience.",

    "text": "Round Corner Cantina is a cool and hip place. Definitely another one of those places in Pittsburgh that makes me feel like I'm in the East Village or Williamsburg or somewhere else in downtown Manhattan or in Brooklyn. The outdoor patio (I'd call it a beer garden) is fantastic and for me is the big drawcard for this place.   The food we tried was very tasty (we enjoyed some tacos and a quesadilla). Some other reviewers have been less positive about the food but I can honestly say that the tacos were some of the tastiest I've eaten outside of Mexico.   The drinks are another story altogether. Perhaps we were unlucky, but the two margaritas we each ordered were just not hitting the mark--they apparently used good tequila but things were a bit \"rough\" to me. Definitely way better than a sugary \"margarita\" you'd get at a cheesy American Tex-Mex place, but not perfect. In future I'm going to stick to beer. Which is fine, because knocking back some cold beers and tasty tacos in the festively lit outdoor patio on a warm evening is exactly what this place is for.  (Final note: yes this place seems to attract the growing group of Pittsburgh hipsters, or \"Pittsters\" as I prefer to call them. I'm not saying that's bad, just giving you a heads up in case you think that is worth knowing.)",

This place is located on Butler street and super cute inside with an amazing outdoor seating area!  On my last visit we sat outside, they have plenty of seats covered and uncovered with a small outdoor bar.  We ordered a pitcher of margaritas which was a little pricey at $27 for the basic flavor but we did get about 6 glasses out of it.  It is interesting that they put OJ in all their margaritas- I like the sour taste of margaritas so the added sweetness was not for me.  The food is what you would expect at any average Mexican place in Pittsburgh. Love the queso dip and guacamole. The tacos have lots of fresh veggies. To get the most out of your visit, I recommend going in the summer to sit outside for a drink",

No lettuce, shredded cheddar cheese, ground beef, or other Americanized fillings here. Radishes, housemade salsas, cilantro, and all of the other ingredients you'd actually find in authentic Mexican-style tacos. And boy, are they good!  I have tried the tacos de carne (hanger steak) and the tacos de puerco (pork belly). They were both great, but the puerco was definitely the better of the two. The apple salsa and the poblano made it just spot-on delicious! I've also tried the chips with salsa and their guacamole. I would recommend the guac over the salsa. The salsa wasn't bad, but it was sort of average. The guac was nice and creamy with bits of cilantro (I love cilantro).  On to the alcohol: the selection is small and Mexican, which is fine with me because I love my Tecate and Dos Equis Amber (small and Mexican - NO PUN INTENDED hehe).   One of the things I love about this place is the price is right. Two tacos, a 24-ounce Tecate, and chips & guacamole would run you about $18 - not bad at all.",

The food is some of the best cheap Tex-Mex that I've had since I've been here, with amazing seitan tacos that I get almost every time I'm there. The chips, salsa, and amazing guac are an excellent way to start out, and the margaritas here (as well as Mad Mex) are in my opinion the best (and strongest) in the city. This place has probably the coolest and largest outdoor patio in the city, with many large tables for big groups, beautiful lights, and even at outdoor bar for all of your needs.

Though they're a bit pricy for Pittsburgh, you can't go wrong with any of the mixed drinks in regards to taste and strength!  If you're going for dinner (or just get hungry while you're drinking there) the salsa is delicious, and the tacos are great and have some trendy twists.  Also, the grilled green onions are a great appetizer!  The atmosphere is dark and cozy; easily lovable with crazy wallpaper and a hipster-charming back patio.  _________  **I feel inclined to add an update (as of November 2012).  I have been a regular customer here for awhile, and while I still love their drinks and atmosphere, the food quality has gone down significantly. On more than one occasion in the past few months, I've gotten sick from the food. I went for brunch in October and was grossly disappointed - my table tried both of the specials, which were honestly inedible. The rolled chicken tacos were not described accurately, and when they came out they were deep friend rolled tacos and the quality of the chicken was very poor - it was the parts of the chicken you would typically not eat.

We were lucky to get a seat on the outside patio - which was a completely different experience than sitting inside.  Ambiance:  I personally loved eating outside on the patio in the great weather and surrounded by alot of energy from the mostly younger crowd.  Everyone was minding their own business and having a great time.  The decor was light and hinted just enough at it's mexican roots.  Given the drink and tapas style of the place, the patio was well suited.  The only possible area for improvement could be in the lighting - at times we had to use our phones to read the menu.  Menu:  I was a bit thrown off that 75% of the menu was drinks and the actual food options were quite limited.  This turned out to be just fine by us.  The drinks selections were plentiful with enough Margarita and Tequila options to have you hitting the floor on multiple visits ;).  The food consisted primarily of tacos and nachos.  The Salsa & Guacamole were excellent and quite fresh.  All of our taco orders (4 different types) were very tasty and (along with the chips), were able to fill us up.  Pricing: $4/taco might seem steep for some folks, but they're packed in with ingredients and will definitely fill you up.  A pitcher for margarita was only $20, which is also a fantastic deal!  Would I go back? You betcha!   Maybe i'll sit inside next time and catch the El Luchador wrestling movies put on the big screen!",

Long story short, we went to Round Corner Cantina for their $5 Monday night taco special, ordered a bunch of $5 tacos, and then got our check which showed many of our tacos were $9 or $10.  We figured it was a mistake, so we kindly waited until we got the attention of our waitress and let her know.  She, with the same blank stare and flat affect she displayed throughout the night, told us only 3 of the tacos on the menu were on the $5 special.  We were surprised to hear this and told her there was no indication on the menu about which were on special, and she had never mentioned to us that only some were on special.  She seemed disinterested from the start of the conversation and deflected our questions to the manager.  After a few minutes, the manager came by and we told him what the confusion was.  At first, we had hoped to talk to him to try to explain the confusion and if anything, help them make it clear to future customers who were also unaware.  But his response to our concerns completely changed everything (hence why I'm writing my first Yelp comment).  His first words were \"She (the waitress) told you guys when you got here about the special, but she said you were talking to one another and didn't hear her.\"  WHAT??? ARE YOU SERIOUS DUDE?? The manager of this restaurant seriously just blamed us for talking to one another (I don't know what you rest of you folks out there do at restaurants) and not listening when our disinterested waitress supposedly explained things to us.  Even if she did tell us these things (which I'm pretty confident she didn't), wouldn't she have tried to get our attention?  Talking to the back of peoples' heads seems counterproductive.  When we voiced that none of us could recall this, he responded, \"Well I have to take her word because she's one of the best servers\" (God Bless America) and he couldn't do anything to help us.  Is this guy serious? He's going to tell a large party of customers that their lack of attention to his lackluster, eye-rolling (again, I'm not the type to normally care about these things) waitress is their problem and that they should essentially deal with it. Wow. Just wow.  I know we all have good days and bad days.  I've had bad days where I'd probably come across as lackluster and flat, but I would never take my own misdoings and blame it on the customers who support my business' success.  I'll never go back to Round Corner. I'm honestly upset about that because I thought the food was pretty decent, especially for [what I thought was] $5.  There are just some things in life you don't do and this was one of them.  I hope all of you reading out there have better experiences, because nobody deserves a pleasant night out with friends to be tarnished by a manager who is too weak to own up to his own mistake.",

The outdoor area (not open during the winter) feels like the set of a movie. In addition to the atmosphere, the food was great. I've had the tamales, the guac, and the potato rolled tacos. All were stellar. The dark haired bar tender is very nice and poured all of my drinks generously. I found the price to be reasonable for the quality of food I was getting.  As stated in other reviews, they have removed the tamales from the menu. This was really disappointing but forced me to try some other great dishes here. I recommend coming here for the drinks, the food, and the hip atmosphere.",

    "text": "What can I possible say about Round Corner Cantina that hasn't been said already? Guess we will see! I love tacos, so obviously a place that serves nothing but tacos, and tacos done right, is very appealing to me. The outside of the building is really cute, quintessential Lawrenceville, and it literally has a rounded corner. Thanks, Captain Obvious! From the outside of this brick building, you'd never guess they had quite the substantial outdoor courtyard that they do, but on a warm day it's an ideal place to sit and enjoy one of those margaritas. The La Cantina margarita is outstanding, there doesn't seem to be a reason to order anything else (although there are many spirit options!),  and there's just something comforting about drinking tequila from a mason jar. Maybe it's me.  The guacamole is really fantastic and fresh, and you get a huge portion of it for $5. The chips are a bit on the greasy side, but it's obvious they are made fresh daily, and usually by this point I'm down half a margarita at least and don't care quite as much. The chunky pico de gallo is really quite good as well.  There are two vegetarian options on the taco menu, the tacos de seitan and the tacos de rajas con papas. The latter have poblano peppers, cooked potatoes, corn, the fantastic chihuahua cheese, cilantro, and RADISHES. I can't stress how much I enjoy radishes on my tacos. I had no idea I was missing this from my life/taco repertoire until I visited Round Corner Cantina. The seitan tacos also have radishes(!), a refreshing avocado salsa, stewed onions, and the seitan is prepared in this spicy-ish sauce that I could put on my cereal. I've never had seitan prepared so expertly. Even if you aren't a vegetarian, you owe it to yourself to try these tasty little numbers. The service has always been decent, kind of slow, but not terrible. Also, if you had never been here before, you'd walk in and just think this place was a small bar. You have to walk past the bar and around a corner to find the dining room and patio, it looks like you are heading to the bathroom, it isn't obvious. The plate size that the tacos come on I also find to be a bit curious, as it is barely big enough for the two tacos that come with your order, which makes things a bit messy. But maybe that's just me. None of these things could ever stop me from craving that seitan taco. With radishes!",

All of its positive qualities have had gone. My friend and I spent  $50 on four tacos and a pitcher of margaritas.the tacos were still fine but the price had increased by a third. The margaritas were made with orange juice when we expected a traditional style and contained aost no discernable tequila or alcohol oany kind. I was saddened and anger after I left. I felt ripped off. The waitress was unpleasant. I don't think I'll go back here ever again. They don't have a  happy hour; they have an unhappy hour.",

Not too stiff, but they stand up well against the food and other margs I've had in town.   To reiterate two things that others have mentioned:   a) This place gets packed on weekends. Get here early or go home sad -- or, you know, wait... but seriously who has time for that?!  b) The outdoor seating is some of the best in the 'Burgh. The back patio has ample space for large several large groups or small 2-4 tops.   Staff are friendly and attentive -- even when things start filling up.   All in all, a great place to take out-of-towners to prove that Pittsburgh is actually hip these days -- though that needs less and less defending.",

The bartender greeted me with a big, friendly smile, and great personality. I started with a white wine, and waited for my friend to join me.  We started by asking for the beef tongue tacos, but unfortunately they were out of the meat. (REASON TO RETURN!) We ended up ordering the fish tacos and salsa n chips.  The salsa was fresh, flavorful, and topped with fresh cilantro. The fish tacos came to us in record time, hot and looking excellent. Topped with pickled onions and an aoili sauce, it would be hard to find better tacos. The flavors mixed well, and for two tacos, they were very filling.  Throughout the meal, the bartender was constantly checking on us, filling our waters and drinks.  After dinner, we went to the back room for a cocktail. BEST THING EVER RIGHT HERE: THE HOLIDAY SANGRIA!!! I am usually unimpressed with Sangria; it either being too sugary or tasting too much of wine. THIS ONE is so flavorful, light, and not a bit overly sweet.Topped with fresh cranberries and anise(the star-shaped spice), I downed two and wished it was Friday so I could of really enjoyed them! Our waitress in the back was friendly, and our bill came promptly(not the case in other instances here). I will be returning, especially for the Sangria and another shot at trying the beef tongue tacos!",

    "text": "I've been to Round Corner twice, both times sitting in the fenced in patio in the back.  Once was a year ago and once was on a recent Saturday evening around 6:00pm.  The indoor seating is limited, but the outdoor seating area is one of the best in the Burgh.    In 2009, the Round Corner Cantina was converted from the 28-year old Round Corner Hotel.  I never had the chance to visit the Round Corner Hotel, but from what I've heard it was a 28-year old dive bar that mainly catered to Lawrenceville locals.  Converting it to a Mexican bar was obviously a big change.  Although the Round Corner Cantina serves food, the focus is clearly on the drinks.  There's a variety of margaritas, beers, micheladas, and Mexican spirits.  Over the last year or so, the food offerings have decreased.  The only food options currently are chips and tacos.  The tacos have some creative ingredients like pork belly and house-made chorizo.  They're delicious.  On a sunny day, having a margarita and some tasty gourmet tacos at the Round Corner is a solid Yelp 4-star experience.  Unfortunately, I have to take away 2 stars for 2 major problems that I have with the Round Corner Cantina.  The first is that they allow smoking out on their patio.  If it's crowded and there's a lot of people smoking, the secondhand smoke is pretty bad.  What is this, 2000?  There's almost nothing I can stand worse than breathing in other people's cigarette smoke when I'm out in public.  I know the patio is outside, but it's also an enclosed space within the restaurant.  I'm not sure that's legal.  Either way, it's disgusting and really detracts from the nice experience of sitting outside.  My second criticism is how awfully slow the service is.  We were seated about 25 minutes before a server approached us.  Although there seemed to be a bunch of servers around, it was almost impossible for us to flag anyone down to get more drinks.  Finally, once our sever returned, she only took drink orders from the very end of our 8-person table and ran away before the rest of the table got to order.  Knowing the opportunity to order drinks was a few and far between occurrence, some of our group got up and ordered drinks from the outdoor bar (and returned before our drinks came from our server).  This kind of thing really shouldn't be happening at a restaurant  that's been open for 3 years.  Don't they want us to spend money at their establishment?  During our most recent visit, the Round Corner Cantina certainly lost out on some income because we couldn't find a server to take our orders.",

Inside was too loud, distracting and dark- I couldn't even seem my food! There was an old movie playing on the wall, and it kept distracting me from my conversation. Also I don't like having to sit at a tall bar table when I'm having dinner.   Outside, last weekend, was good. Drinks came quickly as did food and the service was very attentive. I do feel like the place is pretty overpriced- everything could be dropped a dollar or two and I would probably bump it up another star. Nothing I had (red wine sangria and steak tacos) stood out as wonderful or memorable.  The bar seems to get really crowded, but I really don't think I would enjoy myself there for just drinks, and neither would my wallet.",

I had the mahi mahi taco and my friend had the shrimp gobernador taco. My other friends had the burritos.   Our food came out pretty quickly. The burritos were huge. The mahi mahi tacos had a nice slaw and crema, so they were pretty filling. The shrimp tacos did not have as much filling, but were yummy.   Since we were celebrating a birthday, we split an order of churros at the end. They put a candle in the churros, which was a nice touch. The churros were nice and warm, but had an interesting filling. Overall, a great place to grab some tacos or burritos with reasonable prices. Would love to come back in the summer and check out their patio.",

    "text": "I've always enjoyed the margaritas at Round Corner, actually preferred them over Condado just down the street. However today we ordered a pitcher of margaritas, which appeared strangely \"orange\" and tasted like Sunny Delight. The group next to us also had a pitcher of margaritas and agreed theirs did not taste like a margarita. We asked the bartender and she tasted it. She said it was the sangria mix and gave us a new pitcher. The new pitcher tasted exactly the same. When we paid the bill, we told another bartender who gave it to a manager to taste. She said it tasted like \"straight tequila\". 6 glasses later and I'm still walking a straight line. Save you bucks and go to Condado. Most expensive Sunny D I've every purchased.",

The chips are thick and perfectly salted, the salsa has a little kick, but nothing serious, and the guacamole was awesome (the kind of awesome where you eat it until you're uncomfortably full, but in a good way).   Entrees were also delicious and prepared very quickly! The carne asada is well seasoned. I would recommend their menu over Condado especially if you are part of a large group where everyone might not just want to eat tacos.  We went with a group of 3 during peak on Saturday night and waited about 40 minutes. Both the host and server were very friendly. Once we put our name on the list, we grabbed a drink down the block at 11th hour, and the timing worked perfectly!",

    "text": "The round corner cantina is a dark, loud, and delicious restaurant. You can tell from the vibe of not only the area but the restaurant itself with graffiti style decor that it is meant to appeal to a more urban, hipster type. However, when I was there I saw a wide variety of people dining. Good food and a good time are not exclusive to any one group of people and Round Corner does a great job of making it so that the atmosphere hits the hipster target but doesn't let it outshine or impede on the quality of the food for the mass appeal. My mom and I stopped over since we were in the area around dinner time and the menu looked good. We were told that the wait would be around 40 min but decided to wait it out. We went for a walk down the street and not 15 min later received a text saying our table was ready. We walked back to the restaurant pleasantly surprised with the short wait. Any service should always under promise and over deliver and that's what they did. We had trouble choosing what to get but a waiter, who we happened to know by coincidence mentioned their wet burritos. A wet burrito is any of their normal burritos but with a choice of salsa roja or salsa verde, or queso for $1 extra. We were intrigued by that but couldn't make up our minds. Our waitress was very patient and enthusiastic about the food, saying that she eats and loves everything on the menu. We ultimately decided on an order of elote (street corn) and to split a Carne Asada Campechano burrito made wet with salsa verde. The corn of the elote was sweet but the aiolis and cotija cheese gave it a delicious tang and bite to it. The burrito was very big, big enough to split and still be full. The burrito had a great flavor, very juicy and something unusual about it which I very much liked. All I could hear from the tables around me was how delicious the food was and I would definitely go back to try other dishes. They also have platters of tacos and appetizers which would be fun for a group. The Patio in the back is open for the summer and while I didn't get to sit there, I walked back before I left to find that it was the place to be, clean, bright, and spacious.",

Drinks served fast and ice cold- always a good start as it was hot!   Patio was gorgeous and waitress super nice.   Food arrived in a nice time frame- I dug right in and I have to say literally the best nachos ever! And Im from Texas.  Fresh jalepenos, huge guacamole and black refried beans- loaded- like heaped on - fresh ripe tomatoes, loads of cheese, and those chips- beyond amazing.  And the creamy drizzle was perfect!!! I wish I could pick this place up and take it to my hometown!   His tacos were filling and tasted great.    Our server checked in us the appropriate amount of times and was super pleasant as we got cashed out.    Another reason to love Pittsburgh .",

    "text": "The place was PACKED on an early Saturday evening with a very interesting crowd of young and old and in-between, hip and not so hip, families and couples and singles.  We headed straight for the patio, but it was PACKED, too.  We turned up our noses at the odd room in the middle that is dark and dominated by a large screen and EMPTY.  Luckily, we scored the last two stools at the bar!  We overheard our bartender describing  the making of the housemade bloody Mary mix  to a woman next to us and you know me and bloody Marys!  Naturally, I had to have one.  The b-tender described the mix as more of a gazpacho with lots of cilantro that was made in huge batches and stirred with a paddle.  Good choice there...nice and spicy, kick of cilantro and a heavy hand on the Ketel One.  Nice beginning.    Not wanting to feel the effects too soon, we ordered the pork belly tacos from the bar menu.  Yet another great choice.  I do love me some pork belly and this one was nicely set off with a kick of heat, smoothed out with a little pineapple and a nice little veggie crunch to boot.  Just a little bit of porky heaven there.  There are some negatives, though.  Yes, it is called a cantina which to me brings visions of a dingy, dirty south-of-the border establishment.  And that's exactly what we found.  Flies and fruit flies abounded.  The mirror above the bar was encrusted with who-knows-what....shudder.  The bar desperately needed to be wiped down.  The other negative was the prices!    I'll close out with another positive.  The bartenders were efficient, friendly and very skilled.  Worth another try just for the drinks and the pork belly!",

It's still a cool spot to check out if you've never been here... but if you're looking for a place that's a bit more low-key, relaxing, chill, and doesn't blast music - I probably wouldn't come here. That being said - everyone should at least come here once and check it out - you might like it! It used to be my go to stop when I was back visiting Pittsburgh.",

Some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh (not saying much? still saying something!) with numerous options and solid chips and salsa The enclosed patio is fantastic. You feel like you're sitting in your charming hipster friend's backyeard Decent Tequila/Mezcal selection and cocktails   The Bad: Tacos are way over priced. You'd probably expect twice the food for the price. The House Margarita is baaaaaaaaaaaasically just orange juice  The Ugly: Worst Service in Pittsburgh? Worst Service in the world? Current working theory is that they actually pay the waiters to be surly and mix up orders to contribute to the overall ambience. It once took almost two hours just to place our food order. Just get two pitchers of margaritas at a time, because you may never see your waiter again.",

    "text": "OMG, the happy hour actually is happy!  As if you couldn't tell this was my first visit here.  And what better of a time to go than happy hour on a Friday?  Drink specials and free chips and salsa!  The pitcher of margaritas is a great buy during this time compared to the price per glass.    Let me go back to the beginning.  When we walked in we were greeted by the doorman who promptly asked for ID (thank you, I feel young again!).  The door did state that NO ONE under the age of 21 is allowed entry.  The lighting was dim, the room cozy with a sign pointing to the patio (watch the steps), and the aroma upon entry was amazing.  Fresh mint everywhere!  Made me want a mojito, but I stuck to my guns and had a margarita.  The patio area is amazing and huge.  Self seating so you can find your own spot that you think will be the best for your dining experience (note, the patio is smoker friendly, which is rare to find a place that is friendly to their smokers).  The thing I liked most was that after the first delivery of water, you are free to go and refill your own glass, not saying that I did, but honestly with as busy as they were, you didn't have to wait for the waiter/waitress to come by for a refill.  As stated before, I had my pitcher of margaritas and my friend opted for a pitcher of XX Amber.  Both at happy hour prices are a great buy and also a great thing to help pass the time.    We didn't just come here for the libations, but for the food as well.  I had the potato rolled tacos and my friend opted for chile relleno.  Both looked good but I can only tell you how mine was.  Four rolled and fried tacos filled with potatoes, for an Irish boy like me that has a huge love for Mexican food I was in heaven.  The tacos were topped with a generous amount of guacamole.  I'm not talking about those tiny dollops you get from a fast food chain.  This amount stretched across the four tacos and was a thick line of goodness.  But that shouldn't overshadow the chipotle sauce or queso fresco that also topped the tacos.  A serving of fresh pico was also on the plate, but off to the side so you could scoop as much or as little on top of it all.  The most amazing/surprising thing on the plate was the fried rice.  This is not your typical fried rice.  Think Chinese with a twist.  The rice had the typical corn, peas, and carrots in it.  But I also came across small pieces of potatoes and chicken and I'm sure there were other items in there, but I was too busy mixing everything on my plate at this point.    The prices are a bit steep here, but don't let that deter you, it's well worth it.  To say that I will be back here is an understatement.  I think this may be my new favorite Mexican place in the city.  I'm so hungry for it now that I have written this review.",

    "text": "\"Margaritas in mason jars!\" We planned a happy hour here a while back and all I could declare for the week leading up to the happy hour was, \"margaritas in mason jars!\" Seriously, kids, I find this to be a delightful thing.  We all ordered tacos of variously cooked parts of cows and pigs - chorizo, carnitas, beef birria. All reported satisfied with their meals.  Now the main draw of Round Corner Cantina is the back patio. It's very popular and for good reason. Although it can get pretty hot and I wish they had more fans running, there's just something relaxing and fun about sitting outside on a nice summer day with a margarita in a mason jar. So much so that friends from the suburbs drove in to the (big, bad) city for happy hour. I didn't think suburbanites did that in Pgh but they will for Cantina.  That's enough of a testament to this place for me.",

    "text": "I came here on a Monday night at the recommendation of the Patio edition of the Yelp newsletter. When I walked in, I felt like I was walking into one of those old-time, dusty, quiet bars in the southwest, which isn't a bad thing. It was dark and had a dive-bar vibe, but a bit cleaner. We went straight out to the patio in the back and I was very pleased with the bright Mexican decor, lights and decorative high top tables. We took a seat, ordered an array of margaritas and beers and stayed for a few hours. The drink prices are decent for what you get, they had half price tacos, and great chips and salsa. It definitely doesn't break the bank! My favorite drink of the night was the El Rey margarita which has some chile de arbol in it, which gave it a spicy kick. I also had the La Chiquita Sarita which was a strawberry margarita on the rocks with muddled lime, but way more unique than it sounds. It was a close second to the El Rey for me. Try the Micheladas for a beer/margarita hybrid beverage. The only thing that bumped a star down for me was the service. It was a little haphazard, but still overall attentive.",

    "text": "Noon on a Saturday is the perfect time to try this place out. It's just getting started for the day, after an assumedly busy Friday night, so getting a table and great service is highly likely. (I hear Sunday brunch is amazing, but I have yet to try it myself.)  Food-wise, I'm a stickler for the fish tacos. The corn tortillas are just right, with a sweet, flaky fish, crunchy cabbage and a creamy aioli to round out the flavor. The portion sizes are spot on - not too big, not too small. The salsa is a spicy roasted concoction. It tastes homemade, and I hope I'm not wrong. The tortilla chips clearly are fresh, but with a bit too much oil for my taste.  The atmosphere has a retro charm to it. It's the kind of place that makes you feel cool just by walking in the door. The bar has an interesting selection of import beers and snazzy cocktails. Grapefruit margarita, anyone?  In the warmer months, grab a seat out back. The open, half covered patio reminds me of a backyard party, especially when it's abuzz with after work happy hour folk, which it usually is. It can get hot in the Pittsburgh sun, so they set out jugs of water and cups as a self-serve rehydration station. I don't know why more places don't do this. It's brilliant.",

    "text": "Best Mexican I've had in Pittsburgh so far.  I've been here twice so far and everything seems very fresh and is prepared well and there are some interesting items on the menu.  The guacamole is awesome and made fresh and the chips taste as though they are made on site as well.  Service has always been very fast.  Good happy hour specials.  Their beer selection is limited but their sangria and margaritas are very nice.  When the weather is nice their patio is a really nice area with plenty of seating.  Inside there is a bar area and a separate area with tables with an interesting decor.  They also have random movies with no sound playing in the background.  UPDATE:  Unfortunately I'm going to have to update this and remove a couple of stars. I really loved this place the first two times I went but the 3rd time was really disappointing.  They really shortened their menu quite a bit and got rid of the tamales which were my favorite :(  Also the chips and salsa were no longer complimentary and they charged me double when I asked for a refill on the salsa when we had extra chips! And the guac was not as flavorful as I remembered it.  The meatballs I ordered were supposed to come with some kind of queso but that was no where to be seen and my order came out 15 min after my friend's order.  And these $8 meatballs were basically 3 meatballs on a skillet with no sides or anything with it.  And the drink prices were really reasonable when I came before during happy hour when I had a $4 sangria, but at the almost $7 paid at their regular price when the sangria is super tiny with tons of ice and very weak (although tasty) it just wasn't worth it.  Also their beer list seems to have decreased.  The server was attentive despite the orders coming out very far apart so I don't think that was her fault.  I think for those commenting on the service, it's much better in the back room where most of the tables are rather than in that area with a few tables around the bar in the front room.",

I also loved the decor and feel of the bar and am excited to try out the balcony in the summer time. I had the chille relleno which was really yummy but I wasn't expecting it to be deep fried. I think it would have been better just baked (that's how I had it in Mexico at least) I don't know maybe everyone else eats them deep fried. Anyway, don't get me wrong-it was good. The rest of the group had various versions of the tacos and were all pleased with them. The chips and salsa were delicious and the beer/margarita cocktails were superb!   We will be back here again when we need our marg/Mexican food fix.  Pros: Chips and Salsa (have I said how much I like them here yet?)

Aside from it being too packed at peak times, the food and drinks were always great, the atmosphere was fun and light, and it was just a cute place to enjoy a happy hour or a drink out on the patio!  BUT I was there last month and have been meaning to write a review ever since. I sat on the side by the bathrooms and the whole place smelled not of cilantro or delicious food, but of gross old wet towels, like they were cleaning the tables with old rags. It took SO LONG to get our drinks (I only ordered wine!), and I was bummed to see they changed their menu. The carnitas I used to die for are now covered in this weird (cheesy?) sauce. They used to be more fresh and now are just smothered in weird artificial-tasting crap that ruins the whole thing. I feel like I'm eating tacos at the Steel Cactus or something, not at a cool urban bar in a hip neighborhood.  I dunno, I'm pretty bummed about the carnitas, but would still come back in the summer to drink sangria outside. I definitely won't be frequenting this as much as I used to though. Bummer.",

    "text": "A few friends and I have been trying to find the best guac in the city because we had life changing guac on vacation earlier this summer. And we all agreed that Round Corner Cantina has the best guac we've tried so far (if you disagree, PLEASE let me know what you think the best guac is cause we want to try it!)  Yes, this place gets pretty crowded, especially on a Friday night. We probably waited 30-45 minutes to get a table for the 6 of us. But during that time, we got some drinks at the bar (had to stand for a good bit and it was crowded, but what do you expect). The \"La Cantina\" margarita is very cute and also very dangerous because the OJ masks the taste of tequila well enough that you can drink quite a few of these before you realize it, so don't say I didn't warn you. Two of my friends also got the Flamenco and it was delicious as well, but at $14 it's a bit steep when the La Cantina is also delicious at a price-point of $7.50  Once we finally got seated, we were served pretty quickly with chips, salsa, guac, and the queso fundido con chorizo (a few of us have also been on a chorizo kick recently). Personally, I ordered the chorizo street tacos which come with two quite large tacos STUFFED with chorizo. I could barely finish both tacos even though I was starving all day (probably because we also filled up on chips & whatnot), but all of our tacos were overflowing with filling and the heat on them were pretty good, too. One member of our party did order a recommendation from our server, the shrimp tacos and she was the only one underwhelmed because it seemed overly simple.   Overall, our experience here was amazing. We had good service, good food, and good drinks, and the environment and ambience was great too! I love the little patio with the string lights when it gets a bit darker. If you haven't been, I definitely recommend it!",

It was seasoned well with pineapples and onions but i could not get myself to finish it. My friends ordered the chicken street tacos and a burrito with chicken. They both enjoyed their meal!   The atmosphere is nice inside Round Corner Cantina. You walk in and there's a nice bar in a bright space, and then you walk around for the dining area with booth and high top seatings. They also have a patio but it was SO hot out I couldn't get myself to even look. The customer service is good, and thank you to our server who answered what seemed to be endless questions from our table about the menu!

I was expecting your average (or slightly above) margaritas and dip. However, we were delivered much more!  We started with shots. My girl friend randomly chose Casamigos Reposado tequila for us, and we were excited to realize immediately afterwards that Casamigos is George Clooney's tequila brand. The tequila was really delicious - very smooth with a strong vanilla flavor. After our tequila shots, I stuck with the house (La Cantina) margarita, and was not disappointed. It was well balanced with a nice kick of sour while not being too tart. I drank two but could've had many more. (And kind of wish I had one right now...)  Though we just ordered the basic guacamole and \"plain\" (aka chorizo free) queso paired with chips, I was so satisfied. The chips were homemade, perfectly flaky and crispy and salty. The guac was very well seasoned and enjoyable, which is especially complementary coming from me as guacamole isn't a favorite of mine. Finally, the queso was creamy and smooth, that super warm and comforting type of cheese that you almost want to drink.  Our bartender was brusque at first but seemed to warm up a little bit to us over time. We started asking her some questions about tequila and I could tell that it was something that she enjoyed talking about.   I would love to return to Round Corner sometime very soon! The patio was not open since it was early afternoon, but I am definitely feeling the need for some Mexican food and margs outside this summer.",

Homemade chips could have used a little salt but still delicious. We were in town from Columbus and went to many a place for drinks and food. This is one place I would go back. I would give 5 stars however it is a bit grimy.",

    "text": "My first experience with Cantina was not a good one. I was meeting friends and family for dinner and I had my still-nursing newborn. She was asleep in her seat. I was stopped at the door and told that nobody under 21 was allowed. I was pretty surprised as nobody is going to accidentally serve alcohol to my infant! Then the guy tried saying it was a \"safety\" issue because of stairs. She was literally 2-months old. No chance of her running around. I had been looking forward to my first night out post birth and left in tears.   My sisters dragged me back for brunch a couple years later. I went reluctantly and refused to spend a dime. A year later, a bit more removed from the situation, I went again and ordered some food. I'll say this - the queso is very good as are the margaritas. I also like the courtyard atmosphere. It's private and cozy and as far as outdoor seating goes in the city, definitely one of the better spaces.   So, in summation, I'll give them points for food, drinks and atmosphere but they lose a star for being horrible to a new mother. Stop trying to worry about a trendy hipster vibe and open your space to all!",

    "text": "I love coming to Round Corner for margaritas and chips and salsa. And, I especially love their margaritas and chips when enjoyed on the cute back patio.   However, I was less enthusiastic about the $5 happy hour tofu taco special I tried during my visit this week. 5-stars for the price of the special, but it definitely wasn't more than 3-stars taste-wise. The tofu was pretty bland, and overall the two tacos didn't have much taste. It's a good choice tho if you're just looking for something that feels fairly light and healthy. My partner and his brother both got California burritos, and while his brother chose to \"make it wet\" and enjoyed a burrito smothered in sauce, my partner found his non-wet burrito to be \"pretty boring and dry\". So, my recommendation to you: go to Round Corner in the summertime. Enjoy the patio and grab a $20 happy hour margarita pitcher - it's big and delicious. Grab some chips and salsa. And if you're going to get a burrito, make it wet.  If I could give half stars, I'd give Round Corner a 3.5.",

Also, the margaritas were great! The chips and Guac were super yummy, tacos were...eeeehhh ok! With so many taco places around it's hard not to compare one to the other. Tacos didn't come with any rice or beans but were relatively large. I must say for \"bang for your buck\" I would order the burrito the next time. Would have definitely liked to see more healthy salads, or vegetarian options for sure.  Music was FUN! This place just seems like a great hang out spot in Lawrenceville - wouldn't necessarily want to JUST come for dinner.",

Everyone ordered a drink and tacos, and the waitress was quick to accommodate.   The taco was delicious - carne asada - and everyone else seemed to enjoy as well. It was about $10 for 2 which was a decent price and decent sized too. The beer I got was Tecate to get the full authentic Mexican feel, and the lime on top mixed well with it.  At about 2:00 the outside started filling up which only slightly surprised me since it was beautiful outside. I bet if I hung around longer it may have been too crowded for me, but overall it did have a nice lively feel. This is a cool place for a summer hangout sesh.",

So when I say Cantina's food is \"FIRE,\" I mean that it stands toe to toe with any Mexican cusine in the nation. I mean it is really that delicious.  House-made tortillas, salsa and guacamole are among the many features that make Cantina stand out from your average Mexican joint. With an array of vegetarian and vegan meals that still pack a lot of flavor, there's something here for everyone. I personally suggest the mole tacos.  Cantina is a refreshing reminder that you cab get good authentic Mexican cusine without having to cross the border. Try it out for yourself.",

I stumbled upon this restaurant originally trying to go to Umami, which was closed. The smell of the tacos from the kitchen immediately caught my attention, so I decided to bring my group of friends here.  The decorations and paintings in the balcony are definitely unique and make it a chill spot to hangout with friends. Probably only good for a small window of the year in Pitt though.  The food is definitely tasty... the only downside is that it is pricey, especially for college students. I ordered an elote (~$7), which tasted decent but probably not worth the price.   The California burrito ($11) which contains guac and fries among other things. Would be perfect if it came with rice, but the guac and fries are actually a very tasty combination and touch to the burrito. The waitress also said this was a popular option so this is definitely one to try out.  I also considered the tacos, but they turn out around $4 or more per taco... and I didn't think that two tacos would be able to fill me up. They definitely look good as well, but if you are hungry you are probably better off ordering a burrito.",

Heading inside, it was fairly quiet inside with a good crowd at the patio space. We were able to find a seat without issue, it's Tuesday at 8 pm.  We're hungry and each order a burrito and chips and salsa verde to share. The chips are made there and are on the thicker side. I also found it a bit overdone. The salsa verde is solid, with a nice hint of spiciness. I got the braised beef buritto. It's pretty sizable and they did a nice job in grilling the tortilla. The half foil was interesting as it made it a more fork and knife style of eating. The beef was slow cooked and was flavorful. Inside was rice, black beans, and beef...nothing more. I added salsa to get some different element in there. Some lettuce and tomato would do some good as it became a rather boring texture wise.   Fine spot, fairly affordable. Certainly not authentic.",

Fish tacos were good, fish was fried well and not greasy or soggy. The coleslaw that came on the pescado packed a spicy kick, maybe some fresh jalapeno hiding in the dressing.

    "text": "Go for the drinks, stay for the tacos... Just as long as they're the chorizo tacos and you're drink is the Gingerolla, because DAMN are they good!  Extra points go to this place because they have a fabulous back garden and bistro tables out front in addition to the funky bar they serve drinks from. I'm a total sucker for a little al fresco drinking and dining. However, I'm deducting a couple of stars because the service, to put it delicately, is rude.   It's a cute space -- funky, gritty, definitely of the hipster genre. Prices are decent and, as I mentioned, so are the drinks. It seemed to get a little clubby later on a Saturday night, but if you're up for a chill time, hit 'em up earlier in the evening and on the weeknights. Don't forget the Gingerolla!",

    "text": "We came to this place on a Monday due to a friend's recommendation that their Monday special is $5 tacos. Excited at the thought of enjoying semi-authentic Mexican tacos for $5 a pair, I knew I had to come check out this deal. After all, having closed for a few months due to liquor license issues, this place may offer new thrills and flair that didn't exist before. Our group was immediately able to find seats in the outdoor patio, thinking we were lucky that the other people of Lawrenceville were not taking advantage of this deal. We were served by a petite brunette waitress with curly hair wrapped in a bun. She went over the drink special and proceeded to take our drink order, all business without a smile (which is fine). Since we were a large group, we ordered a decent amount, and then each of us ordered 1-2 orders of tacos each, salivating at the thought of $5 tacos.  Our tacos eventually came out, which came in pairs and were okay in quality. I'll never complain about $5 tacos though. We eventually got the check but were confused why all of our tacos except for 4 were listed at full price. After notifying the waitress, she gives us an empty stare and then says that only 3 of the listed tacos are $5. Mind you, the menu has no mention of any of their specials and does not explicitly say that only certain tacos are $5 during their Monday special. She then goes to grab the manager (or at least someone who claims he's the manager; he actually bartends at the front bar), who comes to our table and apologizes on the waitress's behalf by saying that the waitress is correct and that she clearly told us about the taco special's specifications. According to him, the only reason why all 7 of us magically did not hear her mention anything about the taco special was because we were all talking when she was going over them. To top it all off, he justified it by saying that she's one of their best servers (love high standards) so he has to go by her word. After all, the customer is always WRONG.  Astonished and appalled that the manager was blaming us, we proceeded to insist that the waitress never mentioned anything and that a restaurant menu should have explicit information saying so. He then says that the sign outside the restaurant, which happens to point towards a side street away from the main entrance, clearly states the details of this special. Furthermore, he exclaimed that since they re-opened, they had to cut back on their specials. I'm sorry you guys closed because you failed to renew your liquor license; it was totally our fault. Fed up, we paid our bill and left for good. Only at Round Corner is the customer always wrong.",

    "text": "I took my friend to dinner at the Round Corner Cantina on Saturday to celebrate her birthday. We sat on the patio, there were only two other groups of people outside.  We waited for about 15 mins for someone to simply take our drink order. We ordered 2 strawberry margaritas and 2 glasses of water and chips and salsa to start, margaritas came-no water.  We drank the margaritas waited for about another 20 mins for chips and salsa asked a very disinterested waitress if we could place a good order with her since we were abandoned by our waiter... Who was talking with the food runner and checking his iPhone... The waitress informed me that I could get my own water from a container across the patio--the other tables had carafes of water... We ordered the Puerco:it was pretty good and the Carnitas: very dry and disappointing.  This was a terrible experience and I am very disappointed! When we finished I started to walk over to get the bill so we could leave and go somewhere else to celebrate, the first waiter finally came over and said he would bring the bill.... Never apologizing or saying anything.... He then started talking to other waiters so he never brought the bill! I had to ask again! I asked for change for a $10 to tip the food runner... The jerk had the audacity to say thank you  as though I was giving HIM the money! I couldn't believe that any of this was really happening!  I finally got my change left money with the runner and got the hell out of there! The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it was a cute patio and the Puerco taco was good.    So if you want to be ignored and treated like you are bothering the waitstaff you should check this place out.",

    "text": "I mean honestly.....Could the service/servers at this place be any worse if they TRIED?? Every time we have been here, we get stuck with a miserable, personality-less waitress.  Seating is hard to find if you go during a busy time, and you feel like more of a hassle or burden to the people than a customer.  Regardless, I love tacos. I crave them at all hours of the day.  Especially fish tacos, and this place has my favorite fish tacos in Pittsburgh.  We usually order fish, shrimp and chorizo.  Made the mistake of ordering the chicken tacos recently and I will never make that mistake again.  I'm personally not a huge fan of their confusing extensive drink menu filled with things Ive never heard of before, and the corona last time we went was canned and room temperature.  No bueno.  Have had their sangria and margs before which were pretty good.  If you want decent food in a different atmosphere, this is your place...but don't come if you are easily offended  - because their wait staff is honestly miserable lol",

Round Corner always has a conversational hum lifted over the flowing libations.  I suggest the Pescado (Mahi) or the Puerco (Pork Belly!!!), both tacos. And get a cerveza AND a sangria. I am a thirsty boy, especially on summer nights.  Good news from my last visit: The server was engaging and cool. So now the waitstaff has been intentionally rude on only 40% of my stops. That is 4 stars despite the waitstaff hating me 40% of the time. That is how much I like the Round Corner.   Go. Now!",

    "text": "What I liked most about this restaurant was paying the bill and then running far, far away.  My husband and I ate here several times over a two year period.  Don't ask me why, but we were as enthralled as Harry Potter on his first day at Hogwarts.  I had just thru 18 weeks of chemo and I actually felt like Mexican food. Like eating it, that is.   My husband thought another trip to R.C.C. was in order so off we went, as jolly as Spongebob and Patrick on their way to see Sandy Bottom.  Our waitress was as nice as she could b, but nothing could have lifted our spirits after our foray into the \"Choose Three Dips\" special.  We had spicy salsa, pico de gallo,  and a thin avocado dip that was a beautiful shade of mint but seriously lacking in taste and texture.  No complaints from my hubby re. the pork tacos but he was so tired , he could barely speak. Towards the end of his meal,  all he said was , \" I'm not going to complain, we just won't go back.\". He never complains about his meal; he just vows never to return and unfortunately no one remembers that  he was there in the first place. He ordered a side of black beans, too, but alas, the salt must've murdered the chef then invited all his friends to go swimming in my husband's pathetic little appetizer.  My meal consisted of 3-4 potato flautas.  The menu stated that the flautas were filled with potatoes.  First of all, each flauta was so overly deep fried  and hard to chew I forgot about the potatoes.  When I realized there were no potatoes, I simultaneously realized there were potatoes: about three shreds per flauta and and so overly fried they appeared to b a part of the corn tortillas.  If ur under 40 and enjoy partying outside on a restaurant patio, this place does have beer and liquor.  The problem is the food.  Get yours elsewhere !",

First and foremost, we walked in and wanted to sit in the bar area, but after five plus minutes of sitting at one of the few two tops in the bar, and us not even being acknowledged, we chose to just take seats at the bar.  When they were not busy, things still were quite slow moving.    The food is not good in my opinion.  I will definitely go to Smoke or Yo Rita.  Not really a fan of the corn tortillas (I should have asked if they had flour so that is partially my fault).  My palate does not enjoy this place the way that others do.    I will give them a thumbs up on the Pimms Cup but that is hardly enough to make me want to come back here any time soon.",

It's silly, but a small gesture like that can really make a big difference in the atmosphere.  We didn't realize how small the place was. There is a bar room in the front and then a small back room with tables. The seating was first come, first served. I'm not sure if it's like that on the weekends or all of the time. Surprisingly, we didn't have to wait that long to get a table, although it is a bit cramped back there! We had a party of 4 and part of our table was inconveniently located just under the projector screen, so we had to do some shuffling to get quasi-comfortable.   The service was great considering how packed the place was. We started out with a pitcher of margaritas and an order of guacamole and chips. The guac was good and a great way to start the meal. We stuck to the taco menu and everyone was very impressed with their orders. Each order comes with two small tacos, so it's a great way to sample and share! I ordered the lamb and the brisket and loved both of them! Another favorite was the slow-roast pork taco.  Good service, good food! Looks like they have some great happy hour specials, I'd love to check that out sometime!",

Our waitress had attitude and barely ever came to our table. When we asked if she could split our check she flat out said no and looked like she was so annoyed that we had the nerve to ask. She then said we could do the math ourselves and we could pay with two cards. She may have been overworked with too many tables which I can totally sympathize with, but her attitude was what really turned me off.   Other than the poor service, the food was good. Their guacamole is delicious and their margaritas are also a nice treat! I ordered La Chiquita Sarita margarita...it was corrale jo, orange juice, lime, and diced strawberries. It was a little overpriced though. $8 for a small mason jar that was mostly ice. The tacos are also a little overpriced. $7-$8 for two tiny tacos.   This is one of those situations where I want to love this place so bad, but they broke my heart and I just can't do it! :(",

The food is reminiscent of the ten years I spent in Southern California. No where else in this city will you get pork belly tacos and tamales that melt in your mouth. The ceviche is quite good, the guacamole rocks, and the brie and caramelized onion quesadilla is always a hit. Their margaritas are made with fresh juice, no gross mix! They're fantastic!   Cantina is not full of suburbanites or Shady-siders. it's a hip, cool, young, creative-class kind of scene, that isn't bothered by a crowded atmosphere. I've never once had a problem with the service, the bartenders are super friendly and fun. This place gets packed, so if you want a table in the back, get there early, or you will wait. But who cares, it's a great place to people watch, and the tunes on the jukebox spin with the likes of Metric, Phoenix, Passion Pit, Peter Gabriel and Tito Peunte, a very eclectic selection indeed, just like the scene at this bar.",

    "text": "Probably my favorite place to get drinks when it's warm in Pittsburgh. Mexican, too, though the competition is practically nonexistent.   The good: nice outdoor seating area; guacamole; tacos are good (better than Mexico City; a little behind Yo Rita), my favorites being carnitas and al pastor; Sweet Tea and Basil Juleps; cheap sangria pitcher specials (see below)  The bad: service is really hit or miss, with numerous food and drink orders seemingly disappearing into the void; chip baskets are laughably tiny, forcing you to track down a waitress and order another ($1) basket to finish your guacamole; inside is cramped and especially crowded when patio is closed  The ugly: seating is all \"honor system\". I went here a lot when I lived in Pittsburgh, and rarely had issues with claims of seat stealing (thrust upon me or by me upon others) but it's ridiculous to have to sit and hawk and hover about tables waiting for something to clear up at a place as crowded as this can get. You sit, waiting with your group, trying to have a conversation, but have to be constantly vigilant to see if a party's leaving and keep track of who's in front of you in the imaginary queue waiting for tables (and who should be behind you, but maybe didn't get that memo).   I haven't been here since I moved from Pittsburgh a few months ago, so it's possible some of these service qualms have been resolved. If so, I'd happily give this place 5 stars.  Oh, and they have daily specials (updated on their Facebook, these might be outdated):  MONDAY - $3 Michelada TUESDAY - $3 La Cantina Margarita WEDNESDAY - $3 Dos Equis Draft THURSDAY - $4 Sangria",

    "text": "I am a fan of Mexican food, good Mexican food. Few things piss me off more than crap Mexican food that winds up being an insult to the nation and the cuisine. The Round Corner Cantina won me over with their ability to not screw up a good thing. I went there on a Thursday night with a couple of friends (who are my culinary cohorts now that my girlfriend is out of town for the summer) and we were pleased with our selection. The four of us first discovered the RCC when we were placed on a wait for Piccolo Forno, an Italian restaurant of unparalled excellence across the street. As Piccolo is sans bar, we sauntered across the street to RCC for some cocktails while we waited. We were so impressed and pleased we decided to make a return trip. This is the story of that trip.  When one walks into the Round Corner, you are immediately transported to a dingy Baja tequila joint. I love the decor inside, it it classic Mexican bar atmosphere. I almost expect Clint Eastwood to stroll through the front door smoking a stogie and wearing a battered old serape. The building is deceptively large; the front bar is small but through an almost hidden hallway, you are led to a larger dining room and then an outdoor patio area. The Patio area looks and feels like a Baja surf bar. I like it, it's relaxed and cool and right up my alley.  It is easy to tell by the set up of the restaurant and the menu, that Round corner focuses heavily on the bar side of the business. I don't mind this because they do it right. They maintain a large stock of tequilas and mezcals, and here they actually note the difference between the two (no tequila will NEVER have a worm) and their beer selection is populated by mostly Mexican and Carribean lagers. Not the ideal location for a hop head, but on a hot summer night I like those styles, so I was happy with my Red Stripe. Thry also have a coctail menu that is interesting to say the least. Our female friend drank the red sangria and the Something-Star Cocktail and said they were deliscious, but that the sangria was better. For me, I broke up the beer with a Perfect 10, a gin-based play on a mojito. I thought it was quirky and unique, but I switched back to beer (I just don't do fru-fru glassware). One side note, from my prior visit, be careful if you are drinking liquor here. I was ordering single Hendricks' and Tonics and was easily getting doubles and then some.  As far as the service goes, this is where Round Corner loses as star for me. The service at the bar was quick, effiecient and pleasant, but at the table, things slowed waaaay down. They were busy and I do take that into consideration, but it should not take almost two hours for some chips, tacos, and drinks. Our waitress was nice enough and accomodated all our requests, but she was very slow.  However, when the food did come, we forgot all out complaints. We shared orders of the guacamole, slasa verde, and salsa rojo with chips. The chips are hand made there, as were all of the dips. My favorite was the guacamole, but the salsas, while flavorful, were a little runny for my tastes. The runniness also meant that the guys there got salsa all over us. Followed by the chips we got the tacos. I went full-on-fat-boy and got pork belly, hanger steak, and tempura mahi mahi tacos. Coincidentally, that is also the order of my favorites. Starting with the pork belly, if you are not a fan of fat, steer clear. Actually, scratch that, grow a pair, hit the gym later, and get them any way. The pork belly tacos were excellent; succulent and covered in cilantro, onions, and apples. The steak tacos were good as well, but not quite the experience that the pork belly tacos were. The mahi mahi was the biggest dissappointment. The flavor of the fish was just kind of lost amongst the toppings, namely the cabbage. Also, I feel as if the fis tacos provided the least bang for my buck. They are eight dollars, but are really just a couple tortillas, some sauce, and about three ounces of fish. A bit of a rip if you ask me. I usually don't complain about price, but I did feel it was a little pricey here, especially when I can get tacos of a superior quality from Reyna's in the Strip. I guess you could justify it by saying Reyna's tacos are street food and they don't have to pay for the rent and liquor, but I must counter by saying that the ingredients Round Corner uses are very similar to Reyna's and that Round Corner pays for the liquor with the liquor.  All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the Round Corner. The ambiance, quality of food, and bar mean I will be going back at some point, even if I might not be rushing back. I will probably go when I feel like cocktails and decent tacos, but If I am simply on a mission for amazing tacos, Reyna's is still the king in my book. Four Stars",

    "text": "I fell in love with Mexican tacos all over again.    Happy Hour 4:30-6:30 = half price tacos.  Awesome, nay, amazing Tacos.  I lived in Mexico for 6 months.  I've had my fair share(OK, fine, more than my fair share) of Mexican street cart tacos.  I have a special place in my heart for Tacos & Beer in Acapulco.  RCT is up there on my list of favorite taco joints.  RCT serves Mexican-American style tacos.  What that means, is they're served Mexico-style, but with an American, upscale twist.  For example...we had pork belly, carne asada, pollo, & pastor.  They're serve on two corn tortillas, ~50% larger than Mexico.  Then they're blasted with queso, radish slices, & cilantro.  Ranking in order were pork belly (far & away the best), pastor, carne asada, & pollo.  I'd pass on pollo next time..not bad, but generic.  The pastor is not \"authentic\" but it's still damned good.  I've given up on finding real pastor in the states.  Theirs is tender & soaked in adobo sauce, and absolutely worth getting.*  On a later visit, I tried a Tijuana Street dog.  These things are like drugs in Mexico (widely available, addictive, & easy to find at 5am.)  It's a grilled hot dog wrapped in bacon, covered in avocado, pico, crema, jalapenos, & cheese.  If you think it sounds too intense...you sir, or ma'am, are not a friend of mine.  It wasn't quite the same, but it still brought back memories.    Oh yeah, they have lots of drinks here, too.  :)  *(If you go to Mexico, the one thing you MUST try is real pastor; if it's not on a spit, it doesn't have a pineapple at the top, and there isn't a Mexican guy putting a Japanese guy to shame with his knife skills...move along to the next joint..)",

I've never been when it was too busy, so I can't comment on the seating problems...I've always managed to get a table within a few minutes of arriving.  First, as a bar, this place is great (4 stars). The scene is relaxed, the outdoor space is plentiful, and the drinks are tasty. No complaints at all.  However, as a Mexican restaurant it's boring. The food is bland and unoriginal. The tacos are too thin and so they give you two with each order, which just makes your taco taste like shell and masks the flavor of all the other ingredients. The corn was way over cooked (and over burned) and was rather tasteless. This very well may be the best Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh (though I disagree), that's not saying a whole lot.   Pass on this one unless you're just out for drinks (and guacamole...which is actually pretty good).",

    "text": "TIP: READ UN-RECOMMENDED REVIEWS (in light gray under the recommended views) they more accurately describe the type of service and experience that this establishment has to offer.  My friends and I went here for brunch on a Sunday. We could feel the hipster-non-conformist-death-beams hitting the back of our necks as soon as we parked on Butler Street and the the glares didn't stop once we entered the establishment. Apparently caring about ones appearance is a crime warranting death in Hipsterville. I mean the people there stared at us as if they had a vested interest in the clothing we wore. I'm sorry that I didn't fit into the standards of pseudo-individualism that the Nazi hipsters have clearly tried so hard to establish throughout the neighborhood.   Anyway, once we got around the pack of scowling hipsters standing in the front doorway (with their standard large black-rimmed glasses, unkempt hair, and rolled trousers) we made our way through the nearly pitch-black front room and to the open back patio. We stood for a minute or two feeling the palpable hatred of almost all of the other patrons (and some staff members) weighing down on us. We finally figured out that we would have to seat ourselves after several staff members pushed their way past us to get to the doorway. I have no problem seating myself, but I didn't expect to have to bring my own chair to the table. When my two heel-clad friends were finally able to pull up five chairs (while the rest of us viciously protected an empty table) we sat down to wait for a server. About 20 minutes after we entered the place someone finally addressed our group. Our first waitress threw down the menus and walked away without even offering to bring us water. It was hot so we flagged down another waitress and asked her for water, because the small water dispensers at the back of the patio were empty. We sat for another 15 minutes and the second server finally brought us water and took drink and food orders. After another 40 minutes we received our food, but the drinks came about 10 minutes later. I got the fish tacos from the brunch menu and thought that they were pretty good. Another friend got the Chorizo Scramble, which was almost void of potatoes although the menu clearly listed potatoes as a main ingredient. One of my friends got a virgin version of a beverage and was charged the same amount as the alcoholic version, but she didn't bother complaining. All in all the food was okay, but I've had better for less. The stares and AWFUL service had us wanting to run out of the place ASAP. Of course we couldn't leave, because our first server took another 20 minutes to bring out our checks which we quickly paid and went sprinting for the exit before the glares finally burned holes through our clothing.   I WON'T BE GOING BACK!",

    "text": "Ok sure, the service isn't awesome on a Friday or Saturday night but the quality of the Mexican food here makes up for it!  Autentico!  I'm a SoCal native and have been seeking decent tacos for SO long in the Burgh and of course they arrive as I am departing (shakes fist at sky in taco frustration!).  The pork belly as David mentions is fantastic.  I also really like the empanadas - flaky and meaty.  I think they make them with short ribs?  YUM.  A few times I've been there the corn tortillas for the tacos were a little thick but overall really delicious.  I'm a meat lover - and it's good here.  The carnitas are flavorful and moist but the chorizo sometimes is too salty.  Friends T and P love the escabeche - the picked veggies and the micheladas -- beer with a kick!  There is one that is nice and spicy - they are on the beer menu not the drink menu.  The new and improved patio opened the first week of May.  It's awesome and at least three times as big as it was before.  It's currently near-summer in Pittsburgh which is a great time to go here to sit on the patio.  I went with a ton of friends on the opening weekend of the patio and it was crammed tight with fans but it's probably died down a bit since then.  I am armpit height on most normal humans so it was...odoriferous at times.  However everyone was friendly and having a great time.  I ran into more than one friend here (out separately) who texted the next day things like: \"so. bright. sun.\"  and \"did I see you last night? or was that a koala?\" - oh yeah, the drinks are strong.  The outside bar was only serving sangria (not bad!) and beer so you had to go inside for anything else or find a harried waitress in the throng.  One really nice touch was that they placed a BIG thermos cooler of ice water with cups on the patio so people could serve themselves - which probably saved me from a killer KILLER hangover.  The kitchen closes at midnight on Friday and Saturday so don't get carried away with your micheladas and forget to put in that last round of tacos!  Really my rating is a 4 in the winter when you have to be a table vulture inside but a 5 in the summer when you can kick back on the patio.  Enjoy!",

My scramble had sliced avocados with a garnish of tomatoes and queso fresco. The chorizo was nice addition to this dish. What I truly fell in love with was the Chilaquiles. Two perfectly poached eggs nestled on a bed of tasty corn tortillas and salsa verde mix. It was a Round Corner Cantina variation of the classic Chilaquiles dish. I wasn't sure what to expect but was glad we went. I will be returning to try other dishes. Their cocktail menu looks promising as well!",

Again, no one stopped by while visiting with and caring for the other 3 tables seated with guests. A table say next to us and were greeted and waited on immediately getting their drinks and appetizers on the table while we waited another 10 minutes.

    "text": "Went on Friday night for the first time with my partner and two friends.  It simply was slammed.  Front bar was full and surrounding handful of tables.  The back room, which has around 10 tables was also full.  There is no list and much less reservations.  This was very frustrating, jockeying for position to take a table when it opened up only to have the one person in front of you suddenly have their 8 friends show up and take all of the open tables.  We ended up waiting an hour for a table for four.  Not much of a scene, it really didn't seem like a lawrenceville crowd at all... definitely mostly people from Shadyside or the burbs driving their BMWs down to the new hip spot.  I must say though, once the food came, all my angst regarding seating and pretentious other customers melted away.  We started with guacomole and salsa, both of which were simply superb.  The guac was simple, but creamy and satisfying.  The salsa was full of roasted poblano goodness.  The menu is around 15 items from $5-$12.  The bulk of it are corn-tortilla tacos with various other offerings.  Then my tacos came.  Good lord, I am so glad I ordered the pork belly.  Each taco had a healthy serving of pork belly covered in a spicy roasted, smoky sauce, onions, celantro, apple, radish and queso fresco.  I really wish I could eat these everyday.  At $8, the price was right for a sit down restaurant, but I do wish I could find these for lunch somewhere for $6.  So, all in all, the food and service was excellent.  The scene and having to jockey for a table for an hour really left me grumpy and will make me think twice about going again.  Lsatly, to the table of 3 who had finished their food when we got there, and were still at their table 2 hours later when we left.  If anyone from that group is reading this, what a low-life sitting there watching others wait for a table while you sip your drink and laugh about the wallpaper and run your hands through your stupid balding head of curly hair.  Go get a drink somewhere else and let people eat for god sake.  Not good for groups I don't know what the heck previous reviewers are thinking.",

Pittsburgh actually has a lot of good taco joints & I wouldn't rate Round Corner one of my favorite.  The chips & salsa is so so. The chips seem to be made in house so that is a plus.  I absolutely love the Elotes, which is sweet corn with Queso fresco on top. I would give the corn 5 stars. I haven't found any other restaurant that makes the sweet corn as good.  For the tacos I've ordered the mahi mahi & the potato cauliflower. The mahi mahi is good. But not a fan of the cauliflower. I thought it was kind of dry & lacked some flavor.  Also the set up is kinda of strange. There's no hostess when you walk in so you seat yourself, the seating area is kind of small & it can be hard to get a table. And on nights when they are busy it can get tricky to figure out who's waiting for a table & who's been in line the longest without there being a hostess to keep track. Service is so so.  Round Corner is worth trying and I recommend going on a week night when its not so busy.",

When she brought it out, she made a rude comment about how service is better when you \"follow the rules.\" I am not usually one to complain about bad service but this was unlike anything I had expected, especially for a quiet Monday night...I do not plan on returning.",

My friends bill was $9.53 and he paid with a $20 - waitress was upset he wanted change instead of letting her keep it all for a tip. What kind of waitress EXPECTS a tip of over 50%???? Portions are tiny & the wait staff are thieves. Your time & money are better off spent elsewhere.",

    "text": "Saturday night was my first time at the Cantina.  I must say, when I first walked through the front door I was very confused to the identity of this restaurant/bar.  As I walked through the dining room and stepped onto the back patio I quickly realized the vibe they are going for.  The atmosphere was great, it felt like a backyard BBQ! The place was so chill and laid back. I appreciated the decor and the lighting.  It was perfect.  We were immediately greeted by a waitress and ordered a round of drinks.  She recommended me a margarita, the El Rey. It wasn't the best I've ever had but it was strong and that's how margaritas should be. We also ordered chips and guacamole for the group and we all ordered tacos.  Brisket was my taco of choice and it was good.   We had a great evening talking and enjoying our drinks and food.  It was a great little place and I would go back.  Perfect place to sit and visit with friends.  5 stars- for atmosphere 3 stars- for food 4 stars- for drinks 4 stars- for service  Will recommend to my friends visiting the Lawrenceville area!!  Also, after reading some other reviews I'd like to add that I was here with my 65 year old father, 59 year old mother, and 24 year old brother. We were treated like every other table and had excellent service. EVERYONE enjoyed themselves!",

    "text": "Wanted to explore some place new after work tonight, so did a little research (and yelping, of course!) and chose the Round Corner Cantina to satisfy some post work munchies. I had really REALLY high expectations for this place, and while I wouldn't say I was let down, there were a couple things that didn't quite sit right with me, ergo my 3 star rating.   First, I called earlier this evening to ask a quick question, and not only did no one answer, but their voicemail was full.. not ok for a business in my opinion. Second, when we got there, the bartenders were really super unhelpful. When you first walk in, you step right into the bar area.. it's small, dark, and kinda cramped.. kinda divey, which is not an issue, but if you're unfamiliar with the place, as we were, it can be kinda hard to find your way around.. and when the bartenders offer no help whatsoever, it makes it that much more awkward. So we finally found our way to the back patio, which is really super awesome. We sit down at the bar, only to be told that this bar has just closed.. ugh! So we grab a table, which was fine, just not what we had in mind.    From that point, the service was prompt and decent. Our server was friendly and helpful, and our food came out super fast. We got the queso as an appetizer and it was AMAZING. Seriously the best queso I've ever had anywhere. So good! I got the Shrimp Tacos as my meal, and they were good.. no super amazing queso, but good. My white sangria was decent. Again, nothing special but I enjoyed it.    By the time we left, we both agreed that we were happy we tried it and we'll be going back soon I'm sure. I would definitely recommend the back patio, it's a really cool place with a great atmosphere. On a warm summer night, I can imagine that it's the place to be!",

There's no skimping out on the alcohol here and fresh herbs make all the difference. The list is diverse with something for everyone.  However, there are two down sides. Firstly,  the service is poor.  We waited nearly 10 mins for a waitress to give us menus and water. Secondly, there is ONE restroom stall. Enough said for females.",

    "text": "If you are hankering for a taco and a perfectly mixed drink, Round Corner is the place to go!  Since moving to the city, we have frequented this great spot at least every other week, so I thought that it was about time to write a review.   Typically, we go on Monday evenings to visit the Embury pop-up in the back. They usually have a great selection of $5.00 tacos, and a new selection of cocktails every week. They are always amazing. But, since this review is for Round Corner, I'll stick with the food for now!    We ALWAYS start off with their chips and red salsa. The chips are, quite simply, amazing. They are obviously homemade and sometimes come out still warm. They are crispy, expertly salted, and gone within minutes of arriving. We typically order a second round of chips, we love them that much. The salsa is a traditional Mexican salsa- thin and spicy with a definite kick.   I always go for the carnitas tacos, and am never disappointed. The pork is seasoned well and slow-cooked to perfection. The corn tortillas also hold up well to the generous portion of meat, onions, and green salsa toppings. The chicken tacos are a close second. My husband tries whatever is on special, preferring though the brisket and mahi mahi.   The drinks at the bar upfront are tasty as well. I have tried both a mojito and a strawberry margarita , and the slightly sweet drinks pair well with the spicy salsa and tacos. They have an impressive collection of Mezcal, a slightly smoky liquor made from the agave plant. Try it if you can, it is quite lovely. I fell in love with it on a trip to Mexico City, and converted my husband.   With regards to service, it is always quick and efficient. The bartenders are friendly and make amazing drinks, and the waiters and waitresses are everywhere at once. We have been here when it is slow and when it is packed (such as for Cinco de Mayo), and we never lacked for anything we needed. They have a spacious outdoor patio in the back, so if the front is jammed try out there on a nice day!   Overall, we love Round Corner and will continue to go as much as we can.",

Too much oozy cheese all over them). Anytime we come to Pittsburgh, we'll definitely stop here.",

They need to keep it to the basics and stop trying to be so trendy.  Last time we were there it was the last straw. I just ordered a quesadilla and asked for no cilantro on top because I just don't favor the taste of it. When it came it was covered in cilantro to the point where I could barely see the quesadilla, like they did it on purpose because I asked for none. And then a couple bites in, I found a long piece of hair melted into the quesadilla, so awful!   It was our date night so we treated ourselves to some fancy drinks, YUCK! There was so much crap in these drinks! I've provided a picture. How about less of the garden and more of the drink!   Like I said, I really wanted to like this place, the ambience is fun! I've only had one nice waitress (Gina), the other ones either were overwhelmed or didn't seem jazzed to be there.  If you are expecting good Traditional Mexican food, they do not have it! It is so hipster, the flavors don't even make sense together. DO LESS!",

It's filled with high top tables, a covered bar area with stools, and a little place to lounge at the end of the bar with a couch and table.   My favorite time to go is during happy hour and get pitchers of sangria. I also enjoy their queso and guacamole.   Honestly, the staff can be hit or miss. Sometimes we've had great experiences with the waitstaff and other times they have not been friendly at all. The vibe inside the restaurant is kinda dark and trendy and hipster. The front room is the bar area with a couple two person high top tables, then the back room has larger high tables if you care to go for dinner. I've ordered their tacos on multiple occasions and they are decent. I've definitely had better tacos but if we are hitting up happy hour we generally order tacos too.   If you're going through lawrenceville it's definitely a cool place to at least try once (especially in the summer) if you're looking for neat place for a drink.",

Unfortunately sometimes it can get a little bit cramped on a Saturday day, but that is to be expected.   For their recent NYE's party they gave you cute accessories and champagne for the midnight toast. They now have a sweet little outdoor hut with a separate bar which was neat, however I wasn't thrilled that the people at the other end of the bar were blatantly smoking pot from a vape. I don't care if you do it, I just don't want to smell it.  Either way, great place to come for a good moscow mule and from food. Definitely will be back.",

The food is really what didn't do it for me.  We had the mahi tacos, the brisket tacos, and two of the bacon hog dog appetizers.   The $7 apiece hot dogs were pretty good overall, but I didn't feel the tacos delivered at all.  Two very small tacos for $9 and $10 with no side or anything.  And on all of the dishes, the pico was very onion heavy, which sort of overpowered what flavor the items had.   All in all, I'd pay an extra couple of bucks and be WAY more satisfied with the offerings at Tako.",

Based on the options available, my cousin and I both decided on Round Corner, so we headed over to Lawrenceville to check it out.  At the time of our visit, it had just finished raining, so almost all of the tables on the patio were empty.  We decided to hedge our bets by sitting at the outdoor bar, which had partly covered seats.  Fortunately, it didn't rain any more, and the rest of the tables on the patio filled up during the time of our visit.  To get to the patio, when you walk in the front door, proceed to the doorway at the far end of the bar and you'll see another doorway leading to it right after that (this wasn't clear to us upon first entering!).  I highly recommend sitting on the patio if possible, since it's quite nice, whereas the indoor rooms are dark and stuffy.  Once seated, we started off by ordering chips and guacamole ($7), which came out in about 5 min.  The chips were underseasoned and had a bit of a waxy texture, and the dip was fresh (containing avocado chunks) but wasn't super flavorful.  Nevertheless, they served their purpose as an appetizer by giving us something to munch on while awaiting the rest of our order.  This was a good thing, since the rest of our order took 30 min. to come out, which the bartender said was due to the printer in the kitchen breaking.  For our entrees, my cousin ordered the pescado (fish) tacos ($9), and I ordered the carnitas (pork) tacos ($9).  We each exchanged a taco with one another so that we could both try both different types of tacos.  I found the tacos mediocre in flavor and composition, esp. for the price.  The fish was the better of the two--the shell of the pork taco fell apart while I ate it due to grease, and the meat was a bit chewy.  We also ordered the elote (Mexican street corn; $5) as a side item. This was by far the best part of the meal--the cotija cheese topping was quite delicious.  Even so, the corn was a bit mushy, which detracted from the overall effect.  Overall, I was less than impressed with the quality of the food at Round Corner, esp. for the price (fortunately, we didn't pay full price thanks to the City Dining Card).  And, needless to say, I wasn't exactly pleased with having to wait so long for the main order, esp. after the initial order was fulfilled so quickly.  However, the patio provides a nice environment, and our service from the bartender was good, notwithstanding the kitchen delay.  If you're looking for great traditional tacos, I suggest Las Palmas in Oakland or Edgar's in the Strip, and if you're looking for delicious upscale tacos, I recommend Tako downtown.  In general, I'd suggest sticking to drinks and apps at Round Corner, and giving most of the food a pass.  2.5 stars.",

I told the manager about it and they graciously took the food off the bill. My wife likes the place so I thought we would try it again. It has been about six months since the first disappointment. I specifically told the waitress to have the kitchen heat the burrito and make sure that the meal would arrive hot. Could not have made it more clear. It was not her fault. She made special notation for the order. The burrito arrived and it is cold on the inside again. I asked the manager what is the difficulty with the delivery of a hot meal. Her answer was that it was very busy in the kitchen and that their kitchen processes did not permit the heating of a burrito beyond that which I received now twice. Not sure that the request for a hot meal was unreasonable since it was made up front while the order was initially being taken. Once again the manager graciously removed the burrito from the billing,  The long and short is that if you desire a \"HOT\" meal, even if you make the request up front, the Round Corner Cantina isn't it. If you want a hot burrito unfortunately you must go elsewhere. Very disappointing.",

The Bloody Maria was so spicy and full of flavor --- and only $4, where most hip brunch spots charge you $6 or more for a watered-down version. You know it's good when you can actually taste the tequila. My husband was equally impressed by the giant cans of Tecate that were super affordable too.  The refried beans and rice that came with the tacos could have been their own meal, made apparent to my table as I squealed \"any fried rice with corn in it is MY KINDA RICE!\". And I had to be physically restrained from licking my plate in an effort to savor every last morsel of bean.  The tacos were A++++++. Like, the best I may have ever had in my whole LIFE.   Also had a few of the poblano potatoes, which were also 100% yummers.  We had a great time and want to come back ASAP. I didn't really want to write a stunning review, since I want to keep this brunch a secret, but I just can't help from gushing.",

I had a pimento mule which was made with ginger and red chile - it packed a subtle heat, but was countered more so by the sweetness of the ginger and simply syrup.

I'm not stupid for asking if the family could dine outside. Which is why I didn't expect to be treated like I was by the staff.   Legally, children can enter bar restaurants with their parents in a non smoking establishment. Which RCC obviously are since they are non smoking & serving food.    And just an FYI, I could rattle of a dozen placed that are 21 bars we've dined in w kids.  I always ask and we've always been nicely given their policy. Whether it's a yes or no, I anticipate being treated with respect. Especially at a neighborhood establishment.   As a parent, our toddlers awesome to dine with and has been fine dining, since birth. So, RCC's loss. And with the attitude given today, loss of my business completely.   As for the food. I haven't eaten here in over a year so I can't comment.

I felt ill from drinking these. I asked if we were getting top shelf tequila both times but I don't believe that's what we were served.

    "text": "Considering that I'd yet to try Round Corner Cantina's lauded Mexican food and that I had some spare time before another big concert after work AND that this funky, oddly-shaped joint is close to my job site, I felt obligated to give it another chance to charm me.   While I'd felt out of place during my first visit, the complete opposite could be said about my return engagement. The bartender that waited on me was friendly, the music was soft rather than strident, and this weeknight crowd was live-and-let-live and welcoming, not to mention much less densely-packed. The overall atmosphere was brighter, RCC coming off as a casual watering hole and not a trendy hotspot or pick-up artist's den.   My light dinner, which consisted of complimentary tortilla chips with salsa and the excellent Pork Belly Tostada, was deeply satisfying.   The tortilla chips were fried perfectly and contained loads of crunch and just enough oil to make them rich and glistening. The sanguine salsa they were paired with possessed an arcanely smoky essence that invoked images of bubbling pots and brujas as I dipped and munched and dipped and munched...  The Pork Belly Tostada was a small plate that was large both in flavor and creativity. Served on a brittle, grilled tortilla, a \"charred salsa\" and queso fresco dressed the fabulously fatty cubes of briny pork with layers of twang, cream, and blistered fruit. Lettuce added crispness, avocado and Yukon Gold potatoes brought a velvety sheen, and some radish matchsticks at the very top gave the dish some color as well as some bite to awaken and refresh the palate.   Count me out on Friday or Saturday night trips to the RCC, but from Monday through Thursday when I crave nourishment prior to a Mr. Smalls moshfest across the drink, you can bet a double-sawbuck that you'll see me at the bar noshing away...  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dz3nvHFIcc4g&s=ed76eff354517fae4b4c51496aa0620d9db9c741284fb1fc6211d6871abe8e37\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=z3nv...</a>",

We both got margaritas and they were excellent and a good value at $6.  The chips appeared to be homemade, along with the salsa, which you get complimentary.  I ordered a chicken enchilada and my sister got a chicken chimichanga kind of dish.  My lunch came and it was a v. small skillet with a chicken enchilada in it.  And that was it.  I think it was $11 and the enchilada was v. good, it almost was like a children's portion and no sides.  So that was a disappointment.  My sister's entire dish (she got beans and rice with her dish) was ice cold.  On the bright side, they got everything re-heated for her and she said it was tasty.  If you go, my recommendation would be to pay close attention to what is included with your entree.  While my sister's appetite was sated, I definitely missed some sides w/ mine.  As far as atmosphere, it was a good mix of 20's hipsters and aging baby boomers with my sister and I somewhere in between.  It was a laid back vibe and didn't seem pretentious to me at all.",

    "text": "Located in the old Round Corner Hotel at the corner of 38th and Butler in Lawrenceville, the restaurant has an ambiance that would be impossible to create in a more modern building. The space is something of a maze, with tiny room upon tiny room separated by tiny staircases and finally culminating in a large outdoor patio. (Think the Seinfeld episode where Kramer built the levels in his apartment.) The decor doesn't seem to have changed since the hotel's heyday, but in a good way, with ancient floral wallpaper and creaky wood floors creating a romantic, mysterious atmosphere.  Outside the ambiance is more cantina and less film noir, which is appropriate enough, Round Corner being a Mexican restaurant and all. The place is a veritable hipster paradise where the drink menu is twice as large as the food menu, everything is served in mason jars, and two tacos cost less than $10. As far as the quality of food, the guacamole is fresh made and out of this world, and my companions liked their tacos well enough. Unfortunately I ordered the enmolidas, chicken enchiladas with mole sauce, and they were basically inedible. I have never in my life had anything so salty. It was bizarre and truly disgusting, and so disappointing, since everything else about Round Corner is great. Let this serve as a cautionary tale: go to Round Corner Cantina, get some guacamole and a margarita, DO NOT under any circumstances order the enmoladas!",

Eat the fish tacos, the pickles and maybe have some drinks. Bring your hot date and show off, makeout in the backyard under the stars. That's what I would do.",

    "text": "Okay here we go.   The first time I went here right after it opened, I was seated quickly, service was great, and what I can remember of the food was positive.  Because I remember the experience as fairly positive, I wanted to go back with my wife. The first time we tried, it was closed (think it was a Monday). The second time we tried, it was closed... don't remember what day it was - and not the fault of the restaurant really, just unfortunate. The third time we attempted, it was open and packed. We stood in the main waiting area for 15 minutes and not one person approached us... they just ignored us and walked on by. We decided to go across the street instead. We attempted a fourth time, and had the exact same experience as the third time. We decided that we were done with this place.  Last night we were looking for a place to eat dinner, so we decided to give it one more chance. They were open, and had seating near the bar, and on the sidewalk in front of the building; however, you don't get table service out there - they will bring your food, but you have to go inside for everything else. I can deal with that, whatever. We got a few drinks while we were waiting for our food, and not only were they expensive, they were small, and they were not very good. They used a syrup to make it, and you could tell. Very disappointing considering how nice it was outside, and how cool the location is. It'd be a really great place to sit and have several drinks.  So our food came out. We had the Chorizo tacos and the fish tacos w/ some chips and salsa. The chips and salsa were actually pretty good; however, the tacos were just terrible... and expensive. There was absolutely no flavor in fish tacos, and they were fried. No tasty sauces, and you couldn't even pick out the flavor of the cheese... it was just all very bland. As for the Chorizo tacos, they were a little better only because they had seasoning; however, the meat itself tasted off. We're still debating on if it was actually pork sausage, or fake meat flavored to taste like Chorizo - it said Mexican Pork Sausage on the menu. Needless to say, it was anti-food.  The worst part of all is that with 4 tacos, chips and salsa and two drinks, and tip the bill was Roughly $40!  My suggestion is to go to Mexico City for tacos/drinks. They have 2 locations downtown, and I think they just opened one in the South Side. I go there for lunch pretty often. Their tacos taste amazing, and are significantly cheaper and you get complimentary chips and salsa (and least the first round is complimentary). I know the one on Wood St. downtown has a bar, and I imagine the one on the South Side would have to. The locations downtown certainly aren't as cool and the Cantina's location, but if the food, drinks, service and prices suck why does the location even matter?",

I've been at least four times and finally learned to order three or four rounds at a time because you can go hours without seeing your waitress.  On a regular Saturday night, I waited 45 minutes for a drink while sitting at the bar. They have somehow hired the slowest staff in the world and then encouraged them to work even slower. If you have to wait here for your table at Piccolo Forno, do so, but bring a book to kill the wait.",

    "text": "First, I should state that I'm a fairly understanding person. I'm also what some might call an alcohol enthusiast. The point is, that I've been to quite a few bars - too many, in fact, to put up with the service at this establishment.  I had such high hopes for this place when it opened. I love tacos, I love booze, I live in the area. Unfortunately the service is so insufferably bad, that I haven't returned to this place in over a year.  The last straw was a completely botched happy hour attempt, during which a waitress failed to put in food / drink orders (at all, let alone correctly), twice. After our food and drinks finally did arrive, our waitress disappeared for an hour. Somewhere in this mess, she also became straight up antagonistic after being flagged down by someone else at our table. I'll spare you the rest of the frustrating details.  Bottom line: this is the only place I've ever debated leaving without paying. I finally was able to square up (after going to the bar to get our tab, since our waitress had disappeared).  Recommended alternatives:  For tacos: Yo Rita For drinks: Brillobox, Remedy, Mardi Gras, hell even Kelly's has better service.",

Some decent beer on tap, standard beers here in bottles and cans, plus a plethora of liquors; including some tequilas I did not think that they would have- namely, Cazadores.

Real Mexican is not completely covered in avocado.  The ambiance was lovely. They have a really nice out door seating section and the white wine sangria was tasty.

Was able to sit on the back patio and had delicious chips, salsa and guacamole (a few too many large chunks made it hard to dip into) and decent margaritas.  Unfortunately, the main reason we came, to eat dinner, was a big disappointment.  My friends and I couldn't find anything really appetizing on the very brief menu.  The majority of the menu was drinks- so maybe we had a limited menu out on the patio?  We went with our waitress's recommendation of chorizo tacos and they were not good at all.  Very greasy and just really blah.  One friend ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos and she said they were ok.   Also, they had so many people waiting for tables because of the nice weather that they made you feel like you had to chug your drink and give up your table.  We even had one woman bring over a bar stool to put at our table in anticipation of us leaving.  It wasn't like we were just sitting there taking up space- we were still drinking and I don't even think we had our check yet.  Some kind of hostess and waiting area would make the diners with tables feel a little more comfortable.  I would have given the place one star except the patio and drinks were pleasant.  Oh- and people smoke there, also.  It is an outside space, but I forgot that that is ok to do.   I had been here before for drinks while waiting for a table at Piccolo Forno.  Unfortunately, that is what I will have if I ever come here again- drinks.  Not a place for food.",

Clearly staff were inside, but no one came to the door and said anything to the effect of, \"Oh sorry, we're running a few minutes behind, do you mind giving us five minutes?\" Nothing, nada. Okkk. (And it was HOT out.) So we took a spin around the block, no problem. The place was open when we got back and we got two prime time bar seats and were good to go. I ordered a glass of the red sangria and Dave ordered a margarita. We also got some chips and pico de gallo. It was all good. The bar is tiny-- I can't imagine it seats more than ten. There is space in the back too, but we didn't really see anyone going to hang there. Like I said, we were there very early and I'm sure as the night goes on that back space is probably hopping. However, back space or not, the place is pretty little. It definitely seemed like a neighborhood-y place, everyone seemed to know other and clearly seemed to be glad to be at happy hour. The prices weren't bad-- $4 margaritas and sangrias during happy hour (normally I think they run $6-7) and the pico and chips were cheap (around $3.50?). I wish there was a Cantina-esque place closer to were I live in Regent Square, because that would definitely be fun! The clientele is decidedly hipster and everyone there (patron and staff alike) seemed to be enjoying themselves. I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to come back, but if I find myself in this neighborhood again, I will certainly stop in for another refreshing sangria!",

Each and every time I have visited, I have felt like an inconvenience in the server's day. The most recent time I visited was on a Tuesday evening. I arrived late in the evening, with friends, and when \"closing time\" came around midnight, a server yelled onto the patio that customers needed to \"finish their drinks and get out\". I have never, ever, felt so unappreciated as a customer in a restaurant setting. Though the food and drink are spectacular, they are not worth enduring the self-entitled, hipster attitude that comes along for the ride.",

I finished my meal without the bartender checking on me to see how things were or if I needed anything.  At the end I asked about taking my chips and bean dip home and the bartender informed me that they don't have take-out containers because they don't serve food to-go.  \"Sorryyyyyy\" she said as if I was supposed to throw my food away or put in in my pocket.  I ended up scooping the dip into foil and putting the chips in a bag.  I also made a suggestion to a woman with short hair next to me (seemed to be doing managerial things) that they should post their kitchen hours on their site since they differ from their operating hours.  She asked me \"WHY?\" in a snotty tone and I explained that since they don't answer their phone (their voicemail tells you to email them!?!) I was not sure if I would be able to eat.  I don't drink alcohol and my primary concern on Monday nights is checking out new restaurants.  Had I come down and their kitchen was not open I would be giving RCC even less stars.  She told me she would add it to their site in a still crappy tone.  I may go back but I'm not sure how soon.",
