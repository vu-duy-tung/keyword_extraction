I live in Southside and I must say, this will not be a place I return to.",

    "text": "I knew I'd be back to visit Steel Cactus, I just didn't realize how quickly! After having lunch there this past Saturday (see my original review), I ended up there later that evening to meet some friends for drinks.  They did have a few interesting pumpkin beers that I haven't tried yet, so that was a plus. We were seated upstairs and given menus, as the other two people in my party wanted to have a late dinner.  The waiter came to take our order and my friend was a little too drunk and not paying attention, so I told the waiter her order: a chicken quesadilla.  As soon as she (my friend) heard this, she said \"no no no, it's fine, I don't want food after all.\" So I asked the waiter to cancel that.  Our other party member proceeded to order his food (the 412 Burrito) and then tell the waiter to go ahead with the chicken quesadilla anyway.  I'm not sure what happened, but we ended up with TWO chicken quesadillas and the 412 Burrito.  I wasn't very hungry but figured if they made it, we might as well eat it.  I had one piece of the quesadilla and wasn't terribly impressed. Again, with the black beans, except this time they were inside the quesadilla.  Every time i picked up a piece to eat, the beans came plopping out and onto my plate, the table and the floor.  Also, the cheese was minimal, if not nonexistent... and I don't know about you, but about 75% of the reason I order a quesadilla is for that ooey gooey cheese!",

At exactly 11 they were waiting for their buses to pick them up and were told they had to wait outside. I'm not sure what time you close...but as a restaurant manager myself...I would never make a large group that had just had a large event at my business wait for their ride outside. That is not worst part of it. My daughter was traumatized at what she witnessed next. As they were waiting on the sidewalk outside the restaurant for their buses to arrive...a extremely large bouncer comes out of the building while aggressively shoving one of her classmates. He then proceeds to push him up against a fence with his hands around his throat lifting him off the ground and choking him. He did not stop until he went unconscious. While this was happening my daughter and her friends were all trying to pull him off of him to keep him from hurting him and the other bouncers that followed them out were physically pushing them away instead of jumping in and helping this poor kid. I don't know exactly what went on but there is no excuse for this behavior. He's lucky the kid wasn't killed. I hope the family of this kid is pressing charges against your business!",

    "text": "Before a night at Mario's in Southside, we decided to get together with a group of friends to grab some Mexican fare. With another location in Shadyside, the Southside outpost of Steel Cactus opened up less than a year ago.  Paloma [$8] Sauza Blue Silver 100% Agave tequila, grapefruit soda   I started off with one of my favorites - the paloma. Unfortunately, either the grapefruit soda was on its last leg of effervescence or it was simply grapefruit juice. That made for one sad drink. I didn't have the heart to send it back because the size of our party kept increasing so we had to move tables three times (completely our fault!).   Mexican Mule [$9] Hornitos reposado tequila, ginger beer, muddled limes   The GF's tipple was better, with a nice Mexican take on the omnipresent mule. This was subtly sweet, with a bit of herbaceousness and spicy kick from the ginger. Nice.   Dip Trio [$11] Pineapple salsa, queso dip, traditional guacamole  We started with the dip trio, which featured a choice of salsa (we went with pineapple), guacamole, and queso. The salsa was light, sweet, tomato forward, and had a hint of spice from the jalapeno. The queso was luscious with the essence of Dos Equis Amber added in. The traditional guacamole was light, with the addition of cucumber.  Pulled Chicken Tacos [$10.99] Spanish rice, beans  The GF went with the pulled chicken tacos, which were moist and came with your choice of flour or corn tortillas. She went gringo style, which means it was topped with lettuce, tomato, and shredded cheese. Mexican style is the other option, which features cilantro, onion, and grated cheese. The accompanying Spanish rice had some kick. The black beans were tender and came with melted cheese on top.  Pork Belly Tacos [$12.75] Tequila BBQ, spicy red cabbage slaw, radish sticks   My pork belly tacos weren't up to snuff unfortunately. I enjoyed the tequila glaze which cut through some of the heft of the pork, but the belly was tough and only slightly thicker than thin-sliced bacon. The spicy red cabbage slaw was nice though.  Our server was lovely, but our order was messed up multiple times. It's possible it was a kitchen error and not the server. Overall, I've had better Mexican, though admittedly I'm not sure what level of Mexican fare is actually available in the Steel City.",

Ordered hard shell tacos, but I was told they don't have hard shells, only \"soft tacos with corn kernels,\" which were not crunchy or satisfying at all. The beans were watery, and the rice was inedible for me, like quinoa grains mixed with undercooked rice and a Mexican flavoring. I took a box to be polite and gave it away.  Service was OK. Server was nice enough, but I asked him to do something special for my friend's birthday, and he waited until after the checks arrived. One of the girls actually tried to leave once we got the bill, and it was awkward to explain she couldn't go yet without saying why. Not a big deal, but it could have been handled better.  Best part was the drinks. More of a chips and salsa and drinks place than anything else, honestly.",

    "text": "The only reason I gave this place even one star is because I did have a good time there once before. The bartenders are nice, drinks are fairly cheap, and the DJ is pretty good. However, I took 4 stars away because of the unbelievably slimey and sleazy security.   Strike 1: Me and 3 of my other friends all decided to spend a casual, non-crazy night out at Steel Cactus, because as I've mentioned before, we had a good night there before. We walked in, the music was pretty good so we started dancing. For a particular song, 2 of us went to the bathroom while the other 2 went to dance on the dance floor. When we met up with these 2, my friend told me that one of the security guys ran a finger down her back.   Strike 2: My friend and I were dancing while the other two went to get drinks. While the 2 of us were dancing alone, we noticed that 3 security guards started grouping around behind us and stared at us like we were pieces of meat. This was an easy fix once we all regrouped and they focused their attention on whatever else.  Strike 3: One extremely drunk young woman (I'm talking drunk out of her mind, leaning against the wall, eyes barely open) was being grinded on by a SECURITY GUARD. He obviously knew she was intoxicated beyond  all reason, because while he was grinding on her he was LAUGHING. But wait...it gets worse.  The security guards circled around her while she struggled to dance in the middle and then fell face forward. You would think security would help then...NOPE. They stood there and laughed at her (as did other douchey bargoers, but that's besides the point). Some nice lady and gentleman tried to gently shake her awake (which by the way was the only time someone helped her) when finally ,security, you know, the ones laughing at her, realized \"oh damn, maybe we should help her\"picked her up and escorted her out.  Needless to say, I am incredibly disappointed in Steel Cactus and the lack of security there is there. I am still stunned that I witnessed something so vile and disgusting. My blood is still boiling, and I've had a few days to mull this over. Steel Cactus, I seriously hope your management reads this and reevaluates who you hire. This is a total disgrace and will not be returning here any time soon.",

    "text": "During the Legendary Haunt Tour back in November 2016, this was our dinner place for the evening. The group was about 200 people and this place was suppose to have enough room for us all. I thought maybe our tour organizer purchased the whole restaurant because it looked small outside.   Nope. The restaurant was open to everyone and our section was upstairs in a few small rooms. First off, we are haunters with our spooky look going on. Other customers were staying at us because we looked like Halloween in November in the city. Second, the set was a huge failure. Not enough food, not enough room for 200 people, and the food was horrible.   To be honest, I thought Taco Bell tasted better than what was served to us here that night. The taco fillings like chicken and beef was too spicy, greasy, and not well seasoned. It had some season that was extremely strong. The enchiladas were too mushy that they were hard to pick up without falling apart. While in line for the buffet set up for us, I had to wait a while for more food. Not very selective in the food choices offered to us either.   Then we were given 2 drink tickets for the bar. I tried to order a cocktail, but was denied because it was only good for beer. However, other people were able to get cocktails with their drink tickets. I was upset. I just got 1 beer and gave my other ticket away. Then seating was a huge issue. It's very difficult to eat tacos, enchiladas, and nacho dip standing up holding a glass of beer and plate. All seats were taken in the small place. Then since people were waiting for seats, people felt rushed to finish their meal so they can offer their seat to someone else. I wanted to enjoy my meal and have conversations with other people. That is what is suppose to happened during the tour.   Overall, I completely disliked this restaurant. Not because of the tour experience, but because the food was horrible and the staff wasn't that nice either. Some staff members had an attitude towards us. No bueno.",

    "text": "We actually enjoyed steel cactus quite a bit.  We got the De Muerte burrito and the enchiladas. The burrito was pretty good. It was a little dry and felt like it was mostly tortilla so it was good we ordered extra sauce on the side with the enchiladas just so the burrito was a little less dry, however, it was still a pretty good burrito.   The enchiladas were pretty good too. You get three and get to pick verde or red sauce. Comes with a side of beans and rice. I really enjoyed those.  One thing I noticed was nothing was really spicy so if you're looking for a Mexican restaurant with lots of spicy food this might not be the place for you.   I still give this place 4 stars because the service was attentive and friendly, the food was filling and not too expensive, and if you go during happy hour, appetizers are half off.",

Yes, it was rude of me, but then the bartender asked me if I needed anything, blatantly on the phone.  I say one second please. And he walked away.  6:04 Bartender returns to ask me if I need anything.  No menus, no napkin, no nothing.  I ask for menus and order a margarita from the happy hour menu.  (Couple next to me asked for many things such as check and it did not show up in a timely manner)  6:10 The other bartender comes over and asked if I have been helped.  I was not sure if I had so I just said, \"I am not sure\" and then asked for my margarita again.  6:14 Margarita shows up with no salt although i was asked if i wanted salt and lime.  We ordered then as we were hitting the Yelp party upstairs. When my food showed up (i was never given silverware or napkins) , I immediately asked for my check and did receive it in a timely manner.  Overall, the food was average at best, seemed haphazardly made and not hot, but I really enjoyed our snacks at the Yelp party.    Service needs some improvement for me to up my stars, but I am not sure that I will try it out again on the rare occasion that I am in the South Side.",

Walk in with a date and hostess tells us there is a 30 minute wait. No problem (gave her my number to call when table opened and go to the upstairs bar for a drink).   Twenty minutes passes, hostess comes up, and seats a couple groups who were most likely on the seating list before us (no worries).  Forty minutes passes, no phone call, no problem (it's Friday, I'm sure there are others waiting).  An hour passes and I figure it's time to go check the waiting list. On our way down the steps, the original hostess comes walking back up with a couple I know for a fact were not ahead of us.  Arrive back at the front entrance and ask the other hostess why I hadn't gotten a call yet. Give her my name/number... \"Oh, it looks like your number was never submitted\".   Turn to leave, original hostess comes prancing to the front door with a huge grin on her face and doesn't even acknowledge us.   Step it up guys.   Average food, overpriced drinks, and terrible service. Two thumbs down.",

I was in a very long term relationship with a Mexican and went to every family gathering and reunion. I know what good Mexican food is.   The first red flag for me was there there was not a single Mexican in the building. Staff or patrons. Ok, I'm not racist so I'll give it a chance. My dad makes great Mexican food and he's white.   We sat down and our waitress greeted us 5 minutes later.  She was nice enough but very unknowledgeable on the menu. Told us there weren't pinto beans. WTF? 15 minutes later she says oh actually I just found out we DO have pinto beans. You're a 'Mexican' restaurant, duh you have pinto beans.  Our appetizer comes out, which is chips and salsa we have to pay for (weird but ok). Chips were a bad texture, salsa was ok. My fiance liked it but I did not due to taste.  Our entree comes out. We ordered the steak fajitas, medium rare, with a couple of sides.   I'm not kidding you. Everything was horrible.  The steak had this weird sweet flavor. It was tough as hell and other than the gross sweetness, it had no flavor.   The rice was some weird white person take on Mexican rice with all these vegetables in them. It tasted bad and was clearly overcooked. The refried beans were more authentic when it came to the texture, but they were flavorless. The flour tortillas were DISGUSTING. They tasted like the kind you buy in a bag from the grocery store shelf. The guacamole was the best thing, but that's not saying much. It was way oversalted, but I thought, that's better than the rest of this flavorless crap.  This is not Mexican food.  I was pretty disgusted and the waitress came over and asked how everything was which was nice. I told her we didn't like any of it, we couldn't eat it. She said she would get her manager.   Her manager came over after a couple minutes in plaid shorts and flip flops (weird but ok). He was nice and asked us if he could give us anything else. I was like, please no. I told him where i was from and he proceeded to kind of insult me by saying \"Yeah, it's a little bit of Tex-Penn Mex!\" And I was like no. Have you ever eaten Texmex? This is not anywhere near Texmex. It's disgusting. Come to Texas.  I didn't say that, but I was thinking it.  The waitress was really sweet and apologetic.  Anyways, I hated eating here with a passion. There is a Mexican flag painted on the wall and there shouldn't be. This place has absolutely NOTHING to do with Mexico. In any way. At all.   I don't recommend eating here.",

After some poor experiences at the Steel Cactus in Shadyside, I thought I'd at least give this place a chance.  We got in a bit after midnight to meet some friends on the first floor--the bouncer let us know that the first floor is closed and we can only go to the second or third floors. He explained that the bathrooms were out of order and so they weren't letting anyone else on the first floor, even though there was a huge crowd and a busy bar. After some negotiating, he \"allowed\" us to stay on the first floor with the group we were going to meet.  I struggled to approach the bar and got out some cash to let the bartender know I was thirsty. I waited for about fifteen minutes before giving up. I tried again later and was able to get a weak bourbon and coke. Around 1:40, the music abruptly stopped and a staff member came around to our group to loudly tell us that they were closed and we needed to get out.  No last call? No thanks for coming? Who closes at 1:40?  I won't be back to try the food; if it's anything like the Shadyside location, I'd be similarly disappointed.",

If you're a fan of Southwestern/Mexican style food- this is a total hit! He got the breakfast enchiladas. Definitely a smaller portion than my order: the breakfast nachos. We also got the mimosa pitcher, which held us over nicely. After a relaxing and long breakfast, our bill was a meager $28, minus tip. Always a fan of keeping things economic. Staff were very friendly and attentive as usual. We also loved that they had the windows open, had a very summery feel.Looking forward to going back for lunch or dinner!",

My fiance Tyler and I held our wedding shower upstairs, and not only was it a beautiful day on the patio with the nice weather, but EVERY guest was so happy and pleased with the service that was provided to us. The food was great, the bartender Kevin was PHENOMENAL (and makes the BEST white sangria, even gave us his recipe!) and we truly had the most wonderful time. Sarah Masterson of AMPD Group, the managing company for Steel Cactus, was incredibly accommodating and simply the best party planner you'll ever meet -- I highly recommend that you hold your next event here. The flexibility we had in decorating the place, and customizing the space to fit our needs, is simply unmatched in the city of Pittsburgh. Whether you're looking to hold an event or simply finding a good spot for eating out with friends and family, you can't pass up Steel Cactus!",

    "text": "I had no idea that a second Steel Cactus had opened in Pittsburgh until a coworker of mine suggested meeting here with a group last Sunday evening.  I had no problem finding a parking spot on the street (at 5pm on a Sunday afternoon), but if you came at a busier time, you could also park at a public lot just a block away. Like all amp'd group restaurants, the new Steel Cactus is well decorated and has a trendy vibe while still keeping with a Mexican theme. I also enjoyed sitting with a view of Carson Street and people-watching from time to time throughout the meal.  Though this is a fun place to hang out, the food and drinks are just mediocre. I had a sangria (white peach, I believe?) that was tasty but was very sweet and tasted very light on the alcohol content. My margarita was also very sub-par, and one of my coworkers actually sent hers back to be remade. We split chips and three dips, which were very tasty. I do like Steel Cactus's style of queso - mild, smooth, white cheese - and also enjoyed trying a pineapple salsa. Finally, for my meal, I ordered the chicken fajitas, which were very light on the chicken and heavy on the sauteed/grilled onions and peppers.  Though a little slow, service was descent, especially considering that we were a confusing bunch. We anticipated more people than actually arrived.... Everyone arrived in 10 minute intervals over a half hour period of time.... We had a groupon.... We sent a drink back.... The groupon holder actually had to leave early, before we all paid our checks.... Even with all this randomness, our waiter did a good job keeping up.  Overall, this Steel Cactus would have a lot going for it if they improved their food and drink quality. I would really just plan on returning to order their chips with three dips and maybe a drink.",

Our server was Joey (I think everyone there kept calling him Jo-Jo). Very sweet guy. We all shared a queso dip. My boyfriend and I had the molcajete bowl, which, let's be real, is the only thing you should ever get at Steel Cactus, and my friend had the chicken fajitas. We came in for Wine night on Thursday, which they were out of the Bluefeld riesling, but Joey came by and showed us 2 other options that were just as reasonable (Estancia Chardonnay & Naked). Unfortunately for Joey, the hostess had seated us without silverware, so he had to run and grab some, and the wine glasses could have used a wipe down or a wash prior to being given to us (my friend's had red wine and lipstick on it still). The bread pudding dessert of the week was fantastic, so good that my boyfriend ended up stealing most of it from me.  All in all, the food and the server were the best part of the restaurant. This visit was infinitely better than my last visit, but could still use some improvement.",

I had the grilled mahi tacos, my friend had the pick 3 tacos ( she had chicken and steak) she said they were both very good. The atmosphere is great.

They have some different margarita flavors and an interesting assortment of fruit flavored mixed drinks. I came here mostly to grab a drink while doing a mini bar crawl on Pittsburgh's East Carson Street. One complaint I have is that I really wish they offered chips and salsa or guacamole even after their kitchen closes so you can munch on something while drinking. I'm surprised this place has as many negative reviews as it does because drinks were great (I got some kind of electric blue cocktail) and the pictures of the food look really appetizing. I would definitely come back here to try out more options on their drink menu and sample the food despite the plethora of negative reviews this place has accrued. My advice: give this place a try and form your own opinion.",

The three amigos is 3 tacos 3 different kinds of meat, your choice of corn of flour tort and two kinds of toppings. Wow, they were phenomenal. Our bills came to $6.02 after splitting the bill.

But I had an overall good time there and decided to go back Sunday night for a drink. This time we ordered an appetizer because there was four of us. We got the nachos with ground beef thinking of would be enough to share. Nope, the nachos could have fed about two and they weren't really good. The cheese was hard and the little bit of ground beef we did get was all clumped up. On top of all that it was pretty chilly out and they had all the windows open. There weren't many customers so we asked if they could close the window and she said she would ask. It took about 20 minutes for her to come back and say a bartender had to close it but by then we already made up our minds to leave because our service was not great on this particular night. We just paid the tab and left and not exactly sure if I will be returning even though I really enjoyed Saturday night despite the dirty table.",

    "text": "I'm not one to write a scathing review but this place was just dreadful. Granted, the interior is clean and quite nicely done but don't let that fool you. The service here is downright HORRIBLE. Sat at the bar for over 10 minutes while watching lazy entitled waitresses babble incessantly to each other totally ignoring the presence of customers. As we were getting up to leave (which we just should have) the manager came rushing over to take our drink orders and then turned us over to an unpleasant bartender who seemed put upon to wait on us. The drinks themselves were also bad. My girlfriend ordered a whiskey sours which was nothing more than some rot gut whiskey mixed with a neon yellow, straight from the bottle sours mix. Not even topped with a cherry. Truly pathetic. I ordered a draft beer and it was about as bad as a draft can be. There was no head whatsoever and it was about 50 degrees. It was served in a nondescript pint glass with visible water spots. Yum.  The food itself is also absolutely atrocious. Ordered a chicken nacho appetizer and the chips were stale as if they had been fried days prior and the chicken was bland and laden with gristle. My girlfriend ordered the chicken avocado salad which was a poorly assembled disaster of unmanageable chunks of iceberg lettuce, browning avocados and over cooked, dry chicken with poor excuse for an adobo seasoning on it. I had the carnitas tacos and they were equally terrible. The \"carnitas\" were nothing more than a cheap pulled pork with a sickeningly sweet barbecue sauce on it covered with a cheap yellow white blended cheese. The corn tortillas were also of terrible quality. The rice was not homemade and the beans tasted old and of course straight out of the can.   Overall this place is pretty bad. If you like to eat in a place that looks cool and that's all you're worries about, give this place a try. If you care about good service, authenticity, quality or even general taste of the food steer clear of this cesspool. I know I will.",

    "text": "I really wanted to give this place more stars but I cannot. Walked in to beautiful decor. First impression of appearance was positive. We sat at one of the bar tables, my best friend, her husband, my boyfriend, and myself so that they could watch the March Madness game on a Sunday evening. Initially, there was a decent crowd with probably 75% restaurant tables full and 60% of the bar area. Our Server was friendly but that's about it. We ordered 2 dip trios, which comes with salsa, quac, and queso. Queso was cold on both of our plates and we we're only given one basket of chips. We he came back to check on us 10 mins later, we requested that he heat up our existing queso and bring us our 2nd basket of chips. He replied with \"yeah that wasn't my decision\" and walked away... what wasn't your decision? We ordered two appetizers and we need the other half of one of these... and just please microwave our queso please! So anyways, he comes back with new queso......still cold. We complain, he says \"yeah you're actually not the first person to complain about it today\" and leaves again. Just clearly not getting it. We end up getting one new decent queso to split between the four of us. Onto entrees. We waited forever. My friends have been there before, in addition to the Shadyside location. They always get the same thing. My friends salad had been sitting in the window long enough for the cheese to not only melt, but harden into a solid chunk of cheese. Her husband's 412 burrito, which the primary ingredient is steak, came without one spec of meat. My boyfriend was too hungry to care but he said his fajitas weren't great but weren't terrible. My steak nachos were cold and very skimpy. I've had bigger portions from Taco Bell. The manager came over and sent back the burrito and my nachos for remakes. When our meals come out they are still sub par. Only 5 tiny pieces of meat in the $12 burrito and my nachos were edible but with cold queso, yet again, I could barely eat half. The manager, Jake was kind enough to comp our meal which we appreciated because I've never had such a terrible dining experience. He seemed overwhelmed and frustrated with the staff. Ultimately, we were there for almost 3 hours waiting on terrible food. Also, we all felt really sick the next day. So whether it was bad quality or they messed with our food, I won't be returning.",

Took 20+ minutes to get our first round of drinks. Our server took our order after we were sitting there for 30 minutes. Our food came out, but we didn't have silverware. Server came over 10 minutes later and finally addressed the issue. By the time we had everything we needed to eat, the food was cold. It wasn't even a packed house, so the excuse that they were really busy isn't applicable. The manager still tries to use the excuse 'we just opened and are still working on things'. It's a restaurant chain that's been open for weeks now. They should have things rolling smoothly by now if they new what they were doing. Won't be going back and would not recommend.",

Music selection always makes me laugh - it is quite an eclectic mix sometimes.  One night, there were 8 Frank Sinatra songs in a row that then transitioned into a few country tunes before sliding into pop music for the rest of the time I was there.  There is always something for everyone.  I haven't been for brunch, but I have heard that it is absolutely amazing - on my to do list to try it out myself!  Overall, a great place for a good meal or even just a drink.",

Coming from the south, and having lived in California, I have a fair assessment of Mex and even TexMex food.  This was neither.   The Quac was.. fair. The Chicken we were served was WAY too spicy and the taco filling was .. I can't even explain, the flavours were wrong.    That being said, at least they told us that the purple/blue chips were gluten free.  The tortillas fell apart and the salad/fajita/taco toppings were all fresh looking.

    "text": "We ended up here on a whim because The Pub Chip Shop across the street was full and I wish we had just waited.   Our meal started with our waitress telling me not to order the tortilla soup I wanted to order because \"it's really bad everyone hates it.\"  Then, we waited 20 (literally) for a beer and a margarita. Only 3 people were sitting at the bar.   My margarita was so watered down I only drank half because... well, I had a plastic solo cup of water already. No seriously, they serve their drinks in plastic cups.   Then, my waitress brought me silverware in a plastic bag. I don't even know what to make of this.  The waitress sat at the bar on her phone the entire time we were there except to clear our plates and take our orders.   Then our meals came. My tacos were so dry I could only eat one. It was like the chicken sat in a pan getting dryer and dryer until they were inedible.   The bathroom was disgusting- there was no toilet paper in any of the stalls, one toilet was clogged and the women's sanitary box was so overflowing it couldn't shut and stuff was falling out.   This was literally one of the worst experiences I've ever had. I cannot believe I paid $45 for a meal here.",

    "text": "I found Steel Cactus on Southside to be average. I've never been to the one in Shadyside although I've always wanted to while waltzing down Walnut Street whenever i used to live in N. Oakland.  The good.. my Yinzerita honestly tasted fabulous! I'm not sure how much alcohol was in the original margarita because I wasn't really buzzed for having a beer mixed in a margarita but on a positive note, it tasted great. The rooftop bar is also really cool so check it out before the snow comes!! The service was also good. Bobby accidentally spilled my cup of water which went all over the table and floor. Our server as well as one of the food runners rushed over to help us.. well basically they cleaned and mopped all up while we sat there embarrassed.  The average... the food! I'm not saying the food is terrible by any means. I ordered the chicken enchiladas and Bob ordered the steak- I know, you're not supposed to order the same thing while going out but it stuck out to both of us. You get 3 (small) enchiladas as well as rice and black beans. My chicken enchiladas were average but Bobby's steak ones were really tasty. The thing is.. they servings just arent big. While heading home, we chatted that while it tasted ok, it felt as if it was an appetizer. Most places you are so full that you take some home but this isn't the case. We were finished and barely full... Idk I guess you have to go and see for yourself. Next time, we will order an appetizer before our meals.   Since we live so close, we will most likely try it again and i'll update.",

The burrito is worth a try. They moved quick.   I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but if I'm hungry and happen to be by it . . . I'd come back. It serves that very needed purpose of having a lot of decent food for a decent price when you need it. At least it isn't McDonalds, which tries to serve the same purpose? (Ouch)",

There were several open tables which she said were for reservations. We found out the rest of our party was upstairs at the bar. We joined them and found that there was an entire upstairs section that was open and empty.   We still went ahead and sat at the bar. The bartender was so f%^*ing rude. If I actually wasn't with a group of people I would of left. He took our drink orders and we told him we wanted to order food too. It took us about 15 mins to get a drink. After we got tired of waiting on him to take our order we asked a waitress if we could sit at one of the many empty tables. After she told us that normally you have to put your name in with the hostess to get a table she let us sit. The bartender flipped out on her and us! It's clear this place doesn't care about customer service.  The food is average. The drinks are the only positive about this place. I won't be surprised when they got out of businesses. Save your time and money and skip this place!",

The service was not very good my friend and I were the only people at the bar and the bartender saw us and just continued talking to the waitress at the podium for a good 15 mins before she came over. When she came over we were ready to order our drinks and food and as soon as we said are drinks she just walked away without waiting for the rest of our order. Then it ended up taking another 15 minutes to order our actual food. The second time I tried to give this place a shot I ordered a burrito with chicken in it and the service was also awful again and about two minutes after I ordered my food they bring it out but didn't bring out my friends and it was so fast I couldn't believe they made it that quick then I went to take a bite out of my burrito and it was cold so it made me think that it was a mess up order and since I ordered what they had extra of they just brought it out to me. It wasn't very busy when we were there once again but a group of drunk guys came in and were very loud and obnoxious (it was only 1pm) the one drunk guy kept harassing my friend and I and I basically said I am trying to eat and I don't really care what you have to say. So of course he got mad and just sat across from me at the bar and was calling me obscenities while the manager is behind the bar and he can see what's going on and hears him but doesn't say anything to him but they continue to serve him alcohol. I wouldn't go back here there is a lot better taco places in southside.",

    "text": "Below average rating due to my most recent visit which happened to be Cinco de Mayo. My husband and I visited and sat at the bar -we arrived minutes after noon. I asked for a mimosa pitcher and the bartender (who was less than thrilled to wait on us) told me they weren't doing brunch items anymore. I thought that was odd since the sign on the chalkboard at the entrance said brunch was until 2p but okay. We ordered different drinks (alcoholic) and I guess since we didn't ask for water we didn't get any -no big deal. We asked for a menu and the bartender told us we could only order appetizers at the bar and if we wanted a meal we had to sit somewhere else. We said okay no prob and ended up ordering nachos with plans to leave and go elsewhere after. Nachos came out and were great though the bartender couldn't be bothered to give us plates so I ate mine over a napkin bc her presence was fleeting -specifically fleeting to the other end of the bar to socialize. I should note that a couple sitting right by us being waited on by a different bartender(male) got appetizer plates to eat their nachos with and waters upon sitting down.  He actually ended up bringing us our check after asking us if we wanted another round of drinks -wish we'd have had him the entire time. We probably would've stayed.  Totally unimpressed with the experience of the most recent visit. There are a ton of good Mexican places in Pittsburgh, I don't need to go to one with crappy service.",

Flavors were peach, strawberry, regular and some others. Got chips and queso which was decent. Both these were pretty good for an appetizer before going somewhere else to eat and for the price during happy hour. Ambience is \"mexican\", but on the basic instagram side.

    "text": "I visited Steel Cactus for the first time last week, but my first visit was enough for me. I arrived around 6:00 to meet with a group for happy hour, the plan being to talk over cocktails and nibble on food. Should have made for an enjoyable time overall.  We placed our food order not long after most of us arrived, only to sit with our cocktails for about an hour waiting for the food to get to our tables. By the time things were coming out of the kitchen to us, one of our party members had to get a box and take her freshly delivered food home. I myself asked for a check the moment the food arrived so that I wouldn't be held up too much longer.  As for the food itself, I will grant that I thought it was tasty - I was pretty delighted to sink my teeth into something after the long wait. I had ordered two tacos as part of Taco Tuesday: $2.50 per taco, not a bad deal. I more or less got to order them my way, too, as you can pick the type of shell, meat, vegetables, and sauce/salsa on your order. However, if we had been here any other day I may have been disappointed - a regular order of 3 tacos is at least $10, a bit much given the size of them. Admittedly, the normal order comes with beans and rice, so - you do get more than the tacos. If the tacos were a bit bigger, I think I'd be less hesitant to give a normal order my blessing. Compared to some of the tacos I've eaten elsewhere, the ones I got were snack sized.  Ultimately, while I didn't order a full meal, my food and cocktail were very good - and reasonably priced during a Tuesday happy hour, yay! And across the board, people thought their orders tasted as good mine. But the experience as a whole did not leave me begging for more. I plan on frequenting other watering hole and taco joints in the 'Burgh, at least for a while.",

The last time we were here we sat at the bar when there was only a couple other people there and it took 10 minutes for the bartender to come over.  Then when we ordered the drinks that were the happy hour special- she charged us full price.  We sat down at 5:15, 10 minutes to order, HH started at 5, we get the tab and see we were charged full price.  When we asked about it- she said that her register 'never flipped over to HH'.  Seriously?  Do u think we're that stupid...?    This time we sat at a table and ordered drinks... Coors Light 'drinks' in CANS...  And it took the over 10 minutes to bring us 2 cans of beer...  WTF...?  Why...?  Maybe it's a server issue, and I don't like to call out servers but ours today was Jenna...    Don't come here thirsty...",

    "text": "I visited this location for brunch a year ago when they first opened. We got there around 10:30 and they had the sign out on the sidewalk that said brunch 10-2 but the doors were locked. We returned at 11 and when we walked in the entire staff was gathered around the bar and saw us walk in but no one approached us to seat us till I asked if I should seat myself. They explained that they didn't have their brunch menus yet so they couldn't serve brunch. I ordered enchiladas off the lunch menu and they were cold.   I gave it a year and decided to go back today and give them another chance after being open for a year now. Took a while for our waitress to come over and take our order and brings our drinks. My friend and I ordered the breakfast nachos which was should have had sour cream on it but it didn't. We then ordered a carafe of mimosas and it took 15 minutes to get it. At that point we were done eating so we had to stay to finish it. Our waitress came over 2 times to ask if we were just hanging out as if she irritated we weren't leaving after paying.   Overall the food I would give a 2 star. The nachos barely had anything on them and it was missing ingredients. The taste also wasn't that great. The Bloody Mary bar wasn't much for $7-9 in comparison to other more elaborate Bloody Mary bars. The environment I would give maybe a 4. I think in the summer with the doors open it could be really nice. The service I would give a 2 because it was terrible both times.",

Great to grab a few for a large group or even drink one on your own. The food is so-so. There are some hits and some misses. I enjoy the tacos I think they are good especially the tofu ones. I've had a burrito before and It was good not outstanding. Other times we've had queso it's been great and other times it's come out really chunky like glue almost. The one thing that's always great is the nachos with carnitas for happy hour! Big fan. Overall, steel cactus is good but really inconsistent. Fun atmosphere and good drink deals but the food is never been consistent for me. I'll get something really good then a few days later get someone so gross I won't eat It. That being said I still go pretty frequently because of the relaxed atmosphere and drink deals.",

For one, we arrived around 1:00 and there was only 2 other parties in the place (one party was 8 or 9). We decided on steel cactus because online it said there was a lunch menu and a brunch menu with cool specials on Saturday. So we got there and our waiter seemed CONFUSED the whole time. He said the didn't have a brunch or lunch menu and also alerted us that the kitchen is backed up because there's only one cook. We were disappointed but decided to stay and we ordered appetizers to start. It took probably 10-15 minutes for chips/guacamole and salsa to come out. Then we had to sit waiting for them to come take our actual order. The food that arrive 20 min later was good (thus the 3 stars I gave) but it was kind of a disappointing experience. We kept waiting for our waters to be filled and there were still truly only 3 parties on the place. The 2 bartenders didn't do anything and were just talking and cleaning the bar. I like steel cactus enough to go back but i would go to a different location. I bet the other locations DO have the other menus.",

The margaritas are so sour from the fake bottled sours. The beer was not even close to being cold and practically flat. I asked for a side of the rice and black beans, which she confirmed was vegan, but honestly who knows. It was obviously left on the grill so long it was crunchy and just gross. Do not waste your time going here, there are great options right across or up the street!",

One entree arrives, no sign of the other. I wait patiently for a few minutes. The waitress came over with \"how are you enjoying your meal?\" Explained that I don't have my meal... The waitress goes off to check. For a long time. Either she didn't put in the order or the kitchen dropped the ball. I suspect the former. The additional wait was another 10 mins. My suspicion is confirmed; the kitchen made the order from scratch. Half-hearted apology; someone else's fault; she's really busy etc. Took ages to get drinks too - there were a total of 5 tables occupied. Meh.",

Happy hour: 5-7, highlights include half off apps (except the dip trio) and $10 pitchers of margaritas.   Tip: check in on the Yelp app and get 10% off your food order. Not applicable for happy hour apparently but I would still try it!  The deal yesterday was all you can eat tacos for $10. You ordered in sets of 3 and could get anything from steak to chorizo to my favorite...carnitas. They were juicy and filling and delicious! I opted for corn tortillas and the chipotle aioli which was the bomb!  Definitely will be back for happy hour again and to try some other menu items.",

The bartenders were working hard, and were able to keep me and mine satisfied with drinks. Upstairs were two bars, one with an open top. Very cool! The dance floor was poppin' and everyone was enjoying the DJ's throwback rap and mixed songs.  Recommend, and will be back!",

    "text": "I had some family visiting from out of town and we decided to try this place on a whim based on some other good reviews.  We stopped in for lunch on a Thursday and since it was such a warm, beautiful day they had all the windows and doors open so it really felt open and inviting in the restaurant.  Loved all of the decorations; day of the dead masks, HUGE neon cactus in the middle of the bar, pointed star lights, exposed wooden walls and enormous murals all added to the fun and kitschy ambience.    Since it was a quiet lunch hour our server was super attentive (not in your face kinda way-but genuine).  We ordered guacamole and gringo salsa (would have tried something hotter but when you're traveling with lightweights who's tongues light on fire by just smelling tobasco and the like-you take it easy on them).  Guacamole was OK, salsa was OK-HAVE TO SAY, NEVER HAD TO PAY FOR REGULAR SALSA AT ANY TEX-MEX OR MEXICAN RESTAURANT...and I lived in LA for over 10 years...just saying this should probably be standard fare.  Taco salad with chipotle ranch was delicious, dressing was spicy and plentiful.  Carne soft tacos were tender and flavorful as were black beans and rice.  My kids enjoyed their chicken burrito immensely too.    House margaritas-I recommend getting them with lemon and lime juice and forgoing sweet/sour mix which is usually overly sweet for me.    Overall a good experience, good food, service and setting.  Yet another place that makes me love the South Side!",

    "text": "We had a great dining experience...it is so hard to find good Mexican, especially in the South Side where there is a Mexican restaurant on every block...this is by far the best!  Service: Great, the hostess was very friendly and welcoming, our server Drew was amazing, warm, genuine, hip, attentive, never an empty glass, new the menu, very nice.  Atmosphere: Awesome, dark, with lots of fun lighting, not tacky though, really cool big round booths, cool bar, high tops, fun and trendy, good music  Food: Actually very good, I saw \"actually\" b/c I didn't expect such good food from a South Side bar, but it was very very good. Lots of unique taco selections; mahi mahi with pineapple salsa were great. BF had brisket and fried jalapeno tacos which were fantastic. The Trio dip appetizer was nice, salsa, guac, cheese, all fresh and super tasty. Very impressed.   Drinks: We stopped in quick, no time to drink b/c work, but I am dying to try their nice margarita menu...good happy hour specials.   Super cool place, will definitely be a new go to spot!",

When someone else was served more quickly than myself, I moved over to the area of the bar where he was. Instead of serving me, a female bartender told me, \"Moving won't get you served any faster.\" So, I decided not to get any drinks at your bar. Instead, we went to the Tiki Lounge where the bartender was cool, so I tipped her over 25%. And if your bartender would have been friendlier, I would've gladly gotten some margaritas and tipped well.",

We walked in to a warm, glowing, welcoming place. The host was nice and our server even nicer. We started out our meal with an order of chips & queso. Our wait wasn't long. The chips were hot and crispy and the queso had a little bit of spice.  For dinner I ordered 3 pulled chicken tacos on flour shells. You could get them 2 ways. I went \"Mexican\"- cilantro, onion, and grated cheese. It came with black beans and rice. My son ordered 3 pork belly tacos. They also came with black beans and rice. We both thought the beans and rice were okay.  The chicken on my tacos was moist and tender but not much flavor. You could really taste the cilantro or onion. It tasted more like parsley.   I was bummed. My son said his pork belly tacos were really good. They had a red cabbage slaw on top.  The portions were just enough for a meal but I had already eaten the queso and chips so I ended up taking home one if my tacos and most of my beans and rice.  The food was okay but we have other places that in the area that are better.",

We ordered a couple apps, they were alright, your typical chain texmex . But they were warm and came out fast, so they were still perfect.  The best part of this restaurant is by far the staff. So friendly and totally at your service. The manager, Jake, stopped by multiple times and was so funny. The bartenders knew what we needed before we did, and we ended up staying all night. Definitely check it out if you're in the area.",

I decided to stop one Friday evening and try it out.  I was greeted by a friendly host and decided to sit at the bar.  Alyssa took very good care of me and the group I was with. We had made it in time for their awesome happy hour specials that run from 5-7 pm. She was very sweet and attentive. With her recommendation I tried one of their specialty drinks, the captains hurricane which was delicious and my friend decided on a strawberry mango yinzerita, which also was a great choice!  We tried out the dip trio as an appetizer, which comes with queso(delicious with a little spice to it), guac and your choice of salsa. Loved all of these.   Fajitas are a go-to of mine so I tried out the chicken ones here.  Came out in a timely manner, Portion was plenty to fill me up, and they were very tasty!   I enjoyed the atmosphere and decor inside.  I was pleased with my experience here and I most definitely will be back for another visit with friends.",
