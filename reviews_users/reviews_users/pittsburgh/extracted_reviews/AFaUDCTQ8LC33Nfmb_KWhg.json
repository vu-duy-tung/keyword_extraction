    "text": "Unbelievable is the best word to describe the food at CC's Cafe. You just don't expect that food quality in a small neighborhood bar. Their chef loves to create and it shows.  Anita and her sister run the restaurant/bar, they are both friendly and welcoming. CC's is a small, easy to miss, hole in the wall. I drove right past it the first time we went. There are only a dozen or so tables, plus a comfortable bar. The first thing you will appreciate is the local ambiance. We were new to the area and felt right at home. Our server, Bridget was exceptional. She sat us quickly and was attentive to our every need. We ordered their spicy pepper soup and baked brie as starters. OMG! The spicy pepper soup was like a drinkable spaghetti sauce I once enjoyed while visiting Tuscany. The flavors were both complex and well balanced. The baked brie with raspberry sauce was exceptional.  I next enjoyed their version of the Wedge salad. Yum... For my main course I ordered the Past Diablo it was fantastic, the pasta was cooked perfectly and the shrimps were large, plump and perfect in texture.   My wife Rose had fillet medallions, she ordered them medium rare and they were cooked perfectly. After eating everything we were stuffed but loved the food so much we tried their deserts. We were not disappointed there either. The Cannoli I tried was on par with some of the better cannoli's I have had while living in Chicago. My wife loved Key Lime Pie. We have been back several times. One of the best nights to go is Tuesday for fish tacos. Incredible fish, great value; for us it is well worth the 30 minute drive to get there. If you are looking for a fast paced chain restaurant then this is not the place for you. This place is more like eating at your favorite Aunty's house.",

While they did ask us nicely , they said they had people waiting for the table ,I don't think that was very polite asking us to leave our table. Maybe it's because we didn't order any dessert or coffee. But that's not even the incredible rude part about it. After I left I called and asked to speak to the manager and told her that I didn't think that that was very polite to ask us to leave our table and go to the bar and she said goodbye and hung up on me. We spent $100 there and  that's how rudely  we were treated. Won't go back.",

    "text": "I loved this place! By the outside I would've never even thought it was an option for good food, but thanks to Yelp we went. CC's ambiance is a small mom and pop restaurant, giving you the amazing service you would expect. It is just that though, small. So be prepared to wait unless you have a party of +5 to make a reservation.  We headed to the bar for a few cocktails while we waited and before we knew it, it was time to eat!  First you start off with their bread and dipping sauce. Delish. Then you get your salad which they mix up right in front of you with their house dressing. Delish. Then came my parmesan scallops with pasta. Holy moley. Amazing. I do wish I would've gotten 4 scallops for their size but this homemade pasta made up for it. You had your choice on which type of noodle you preferred. We both went for angel hair.  My fiance got his ahi tuna pasta and this came with the entire tuna fish pretty much! It even came to his spice liking. The homemade pasta in our entrees made the meal. Though our stomachs were more than satisfied, we knew dessert was in order to round out this tasty Italian meal. We ordered the butterfinger Oreo crusted pie, which was also homemade. I think that lasted all of one minute? The owner or manager, Anita came over to talk to us and was so nice. You can tell this place cares about their customers. She laughed when I said I heard of them from Yelp bc she can't turn on a computer!! Haha! Coming from an Italian girl who grew up eating Italian homemade meals this is the best in the area!  Mangia mangia!",

Small, nicely laid out and boasting a menu that can compete anywhere. The bar food is surprising: tasty, plentiful and more than reasonably priced. But the restaurant takes it to another level. I was in the restaurant business for about 10 years in Vermont, Maine, the Caribbean and NY.  I live in NY and I eat out a lot. The Veal Chop may have been the single best piece of meat I have ever been served. The staff is great and the meal is reasonably priced and certainly worth every penny.

It is absolutely the best butternut squash ravioli I have ever tasted- highly recommend! It's in a quiet location in Sharpsburg that isn't very fancy but they really focus on the quality of food.

    "text": "Sharpsburg is not an area of Pittsburgh that I frequent on a regular basis.  My friend John and I get together every few months for dinner and he recommended this joint.  I immediately said yes (I love a new adventure) and did not do any research.  I actually had no clue I was headed for an Italian feast that was both filling and flavorful.  I thought we were headed out to a dive-bar for wings and beer.  When we came off the Highland Park Bridge and wrapped around the exit, CC's was right along the main drag, literally a stone's throw from the bridge.    Entering the restaurant, the parking was limited, but lot was well kept (after a snow storm recently occurred in the city).  It seemed as though we were entering a house party in one of Pittsburgh's thriving \"Mill-Town's\" of yesteryear.  The bar was tiny, as well as the dining room.  If I could have a complaint, it would be the close quarters of the joint.  The bartender spotted us entering and immediately sat us in the dining room.  We were immediately welcomed with water and Italian bread with dipping oil.  I had Onaga (mild Hawaiian fish) drenched in butter and pomegranate reduction sauce served with broccoli (my choice).  I started with a caesar salad.  John had the iceberg wedge salad (HUGE) to start and Veal for his entree.  We split a $20 bottle of Malbec.  I literally wanted to lift and lick my entree plate upon completion (held back from doing so).  I mentioned that the close quarters environment as a negative, but well into the dining experience this was quickly forgotten.  The waitress knew all of the specials and opened the bottle of wine with ease and confidence.  5 STARS with a purpose!!!",

    "text": "I ate here last night for dinner with my girlfriend after reading some of the reviews on Yelp.  The outside of the restaurant is ho-hum and not much to look at but the inside is quaint and quite nice.  We were seated almost immediately in a booth and told of the many different specials that they had that evening.  Since we were trying to make it to a movie, we decided to forgo an appetizer and have entrees only.  For my entree I decided upon the Russian shrimp which had shrimp, mushrooms and artichokes in a vodka sauce while my girlfriend decided on the pasta al pesto with chicken.  They were both served with homemade pasta and we were delighted when given the choice between linguine, angel hair, penne or pepper linguine.  Both my girlfriend and I ended up choosing the pepper linguine.  Shortly after ordering our server came out with some nice slices of Italian bread paired with an olive oil and spice dipping sauce (oregano and other items) which tasted wonderfully.  Both of our entrees also came with salads that were mixed and plated table side much to our surprise.  The salad had a nice house dressing on it and tasted nicely, especially with the Gorgonzola cheese on the side which the server recommended.  With both the salad and bread being delicious I was really looking forward to our entrees.  After they came out I first tried the pasta al pesto and it was delicious with the sauce matching the pepper pasta perfectly.  Then I tried my dish and I have to admit that I was somewhat disappointed.  The vodka sauce seemed watered down and by that I mean that it had a watery consistency and was very bland, almost like water had been added at the very end.  That made my meal somewhat disappointing as everything else in it was good and cooked perfectly.  It also dropped what would have been a five star review down to four.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  Everything except for my sauce was fantastic and I would go so far as to call this place a hidden gem.  With that comment though, I really want to think that the sauce that I had was a mistake and not what it is normally like.",

I could eat the crab bruschetta all day everyday.  Great house salad.  Many options on the menu, but the specials are why I come back.  Just go eat here and support a local business doing things right.",

    "text": "The food was good and the menu creative. But service was poor. 2.5 hours for dinner is not acceptable. Also the fine dining experience is ruined by them putting craft paper on top of the cloth tablecloths so they don't have to wash them.  I went for fine dining and the paper felt like a cheap BBQ joint.  Also they post all-caps signs in bathroom and on credit card tray asking (TELLING) you to tip in cash not credit card.  I understand why but very tacky. Nice places don't do these things.",

The beet salad had very little beets, very disappointing.  My husband had penne pasta, terrible!  This was not my first time there, it seems to me that the quantity and quality of food has changed for the worst!!",

I had shrimp and scallops over pasta and my husband had Cajun shrimp over pasta. Both entrees were generous in portion and very tasty.  The wine was also excellent. We will definitely be coming back and bringing friends!",

I had the crab cakes - huge and nothing but crab!!!  They were amazing!  My daughter had ravioli that was just fantastic. The place was a zoo though, so we sat in the bar rather than wait an hour for a table. I'll definitely be back!!!",

    "text": "CC's is a great place for a low-key, but super delicious meal.  There's a great bar in the front of the space and about 10 tables in the back.  I grew up eating lots of homemade Italian food, so I'm pretty picky about how I like it prepared when we go out to eat.  This place makes my tummy happy and reminds me of my childhood Sunday dinners. I ordered the chicken picatta, which is really scrumptious and was told that there's a nice choice of sides from which to choose. (I went with the steamed broccoli sprinkled with parm and was way happy about it.) Also, the beet salad (check out my pictures) is like heaven on a plate.  It's worth the up-charge for sure.  On a more adult note, I really appreciate that this place offers about 10 or so $20 wine bottles on their drink menu.  It's rare to find a restaurant that offers legit wine for less than $50 or so per bottle.  I love to share wine at dinner and one bottle is usually the perfect amount when there's an appetizer and a main meal involved.  Finally, the bar is a really cozy place to have a drink and wait for a table, but you could end up sitting there for the better part of an hour if you don't call ahead or make reservations.",

    "text": "This was the worst restaurant experience of my life. I went here with my mother and we expected the typical hour we spend together chatting in a restaurant. The subpar food ended up taking rather long, so we asked another waitress if she might let our waitress know we had to leave at a certain time and that we would need our food soon. Shortly thereafter, the owner, Anita, brought our food to us demanding to know why we were rushing them. She was aggressive and very in our face, even to the point of slamming a ticket on the table to show us that our food had been put in \"just a half hour ago\". When we informed her that we weren't complaining and that we simply needed to go at a certain time, she scoffed at us and told us to leave and never come back. She then returned AGAIN and continued to verbally attack my mother, leaving both of us and our waitress shocked. We couldn't get out of there fast enough. As far as food service goes, this has been some of the worst. Our waitress was very kind and sympathetic through the whole process, but the owner had my mother nearly in tears. Rest assured Anita, we will never come back.",

Shrimp and scallop Alfredo - another disappointment. The sauce was very bland. I added both salt and Parmesan cheese in hopes of giving it more flavor but to no avail. Ravioli with tomato cream sauce - good. Both the ravioli and sauce were solid. Perhaps the best part of the meal was the cannoli for dessert. Delicious. Considering that I dropped over $100 on a dinner for 3, I don't think I'll be coming back. And I'm sorry, but I detect some \"friends and family\" bias in some of the reviews here.",
